by @entity0 @entity1 is better at making history than studying it			1
but he could surely see the folly in one famous old telegram sent from the baroque splendour of the @entity7 : ‘ cracked the system			1
’ @entity10 , @entity11 , and the future @entity12 all invested on the green baize in this chandeliered masterpiece			2
but even if a @entity16 called @entity15 waltzed out of the building with £ 387,000 in one week in 1966 — or £ 4.6million in today ’s money — most gamblers leave with a hole in their pockets			2
beating the system is simply not possible			0
nor is it on the newly laid @entity24 of the square outside , with the @entity26 on one corner , or on any part of the wiry streets that stage the @entity30			0
‘ @entity31 is unlike anything else , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ you know death — not death — but the wall , is just there			0
that one small turn in too early and you ’re gone			0
brake a couple of metres too late and you ’re in the wall			0
that ’s why it ’s the best track			0
there is no room for error			0
’ ready to go : @entity1 poses for a picture with @entity49 and @entity51 winner @entity50 @entity53 couple : @entity1 and @entity49 attend @entity55 's 21st @entity54 even a slight brush with one of the barriers can spell the end of a driver ’s race , such is the shell - like vulnerability of modern cars and tyres			1
that is what makes today ’s qualifying session and tomorrow ’s race unmissable			2
form , says @entity1 , winner of the last four races , should prevail			1
it is a track where , despite some of his comments to the contrary , he has previously driven with conspicuous brilliance , in @entity76 and in his soaring journey through the junior ranks			0
but he will not be the only high - stakes gambler in the @entity81 team			1
@entity82 , who trails @entity1 by three points in what has turned into a private duel after only five races of a 19 - round season , arguably must risk more again			1
@entity82 has been marginally outperformed by @entity1 at decisive moments this year , such as in qualifying , and starting on pole is more significant in @entity31			1
in form : @entity81 man @entity1 has won the last four races , and leads @entity82 by three points sailing away : @entity1 knows the importance of pole position to winning in @entity31 all eyes on me : the @entity96 has won the last four races , all with his team - mate @entity82 finishing second @entity82 has shown remarkable fortitude , born of serene confidence , having been runner - up to @entity1 in @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
it was announced on friday that he has signed a two - year contract extension with @entity81 — a potential lift to his esteem			1
another important boost could be that he won here last year from pole position , whereas @entity1 has yet to qualify fastest in @entity31 during seven years in @entity76			1
‘ that ’s true , ’ said @entity1 , when reminded of the fact			1
‘ jeez , i have n’t been on pole			2
i was on pole in @entity114 , and @entity115 , but , yeah , i did n’t even think of that			2
‘ in 2009 i had the chance to be on pole but i crashed			2
last year , i was n’t quick enough			0
this year , i know i ’ve got the car			0
i do n’t have an excuse			0
’ if @entity1 succeeds , it would surely be hard for @entity82 to retain the belief that he can emulate his father @entity123 by becoming world champion			1
secret weapon ? @entity82 wants to stop @entity1 's momentum and stay in touch in the world championship snap happy : the @entity129 signed a contract extension with @entity81 this week home from home : @entity82 grew up in @entity31 and walked the roads , which form the track , to get to school sir @entity136 , a three - time winner of the @entity30 , said : ‘ i would n’t discount @entity82 from winning the race			1
he ’s got a really good mind , that boy			0
he ’s come of age as a driver			0
‘ getting pole and a good start is crucial			1
after that , winning in @entity7 actually is n’t that hard			2
the most important thing is not to make mistakes			0
the new turbo - powered engines make mistakes more likely			2
the power does n’t come in as it does in a normally aspirated engine ; it can come as a bit of a surprise			0
’ the season — as opposed to @entity155 — needs @entity82 to win and stimulate some rivalry			2
ennui is already in danger of setting in			0
that is why we should welcome @entity1 ’s comment that his humble origins in @entity163 make him ‘ hungrier ’ for success than @entity82 , with his gilded upbringing			1
agree or not , it was a rebuke to the sterility of modern @entity76 , in which corporate banalities trip off every tongue .			0

@entity1 looking for fifth straight *victory* in @entity7
@entity96 leads @entity81 team - mate @entity82 by three points in *standings*
pole position will be crucial to determining race winner in @entity31
