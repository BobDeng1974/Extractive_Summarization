caretaker @entity1 boss @entity0 will not rush @entity2 as he attempts to revive the club 's season			1
the @entity5 have had to do without the 25 - year - old @entity7 international 's invention for the last four - and - a - half months after he tore a thigh muscle just three games into his career on @entity11 following a £ 6million summer move from @entity13			1
however , while he could desperately do with the services of a man who former boss @entity16 believed would link midfield with attack this season , @entity0 will resist the temptation to throw him straight back into the mix. @entity2 is back in training for @entity1 following a four - and - a - half month absence the 25 - year - old @entity7 midfielder tore has thigh muscle just three games into his @entity5 career he said : ' having him , @entity28 and @entity29 fit again just adds to the group			1
' he seems a huge character , he 's a good talker who pops in every morning for a chat			0
he 's one of the big characters in the dressing room			0
' but we need him fully fit			0
i think he 's got to have two , maybe three under 21 games and then maybe 45 minutes , 70 and then a full game			0
he 's still a little bit off at the moment			0
' @entity43 was fit enough to join the rest of his team - mates on this week 's warm weather training camp in @entity47 , where he will be able to go through his paces away from the wind , rain and show which has hit @entity11 in recent days			1
@entity1 caretaker boss @entity0 insists @entity43 will not be rushed back into first - team action @entity43 ( left ) trains alongside @entity52 during a session at @entity1 's training ground last week the party jetted out on sunday , a day after a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity57 , their seventh in nine games in all competitions , saw them slip out of the top half of the @entity63 table			1
@entity1 have won none of the four games they have played since @entity16 's departure for @entity67 and have collected just one of the league nine points they have contested during that period			2
however , 25 - year - old @entity7 full - back @entity72 is refusing to write off the season			1
@entity72 is confident the impending return from injury of the likes of compatriot @entity43 , @entity78 and @entity79 can help to rekindle the campaign			1
@entity78 ( left ) , pictured scoring against @entity81 , is also back in training for @entity1 @entity28 ( centre ) , pictured during training last week , returned to the @entity5 bench on saturday he said : ' we have to try to reach as high as possible			1
for certain , we are looking to finish in the top half of the table			0
that 's our main aim now			0
' we have @entity2 to come back and other good players			2
it 's nice to know			0
they can make us stronger			0
' @entity43 could prove a key figure as @entity1 attempt to increase their goal - threat with youngster @entity98 currently carrying a heavy burden as a lone striker with @entity101 away with @entity102 and @entity103 yet to open his league account			1
@entity1 do not play again until january 31 , when they visit struggling @entity105 , and @entity0 for one is hoping the ongoing search for a head coach will have yielded positives results by then having thrown his own hat into the ring			2
but just as he is remaining patient with @entity43 , so too is managing director @entity112 as he attempts to get the right man for the job			0
@entity29 , pictured against @entity57 , has also recently returned from injury for the @entity5			2

@entity2 is back in training with @entity1 after injury
the £ 6million *signing* tore a thigh muscle three games into @entity5 career
he has been out for four - and - a - half months and will not be rushed back
@entity5 caretaker boss @entity0 will not force him back too soon
@entity72 believes @entity43 's return can make @entity1 ' stronger '
