by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 13:39 est , 16 november 2012 she has become known as a shrewd socialite , throwing lavish garden parties for the military 's top brass and referring to the most influential as ' close friends '			0
and now , @entity7 , the @entity8 housewife whose complaint over threatening emails revealed @entity12 ' affair , has attempted to exploit her connections once again			1
in her first words since her part in the scandal was revealed over the weekend , @entity7 has sent a string of pleading emails to the @entity20 mayor , complaining she has been receiving threats and claiming : ' the truth will one day prevail			1
she claims her three children are scared to return home and her doctor husband has been forced to sleep at the hospital because he can not get into their driveway , due to the swarms of media			1
' dear mayor @entity31 , ' she wrote , adding that she , @entity12 and general @entity39 - whom she was found to have exchanged ' flirtatious ' emails with - ' have been exploited by the media '			1
' i would n't care - if they got the facts right and the focus was on the criminal that stalked all of us , ' she added , apparently referring to @entity12 ' mistress @entity48			0
' but the truth will one day prevail			0
' it is the second instance of her trying to exploit her ' position ' - after she called the police asking for ' diplomatic protection ' from the media due to her role as honorary consul to @entity59			2
not smiling now : @entity7 is pictured entertaining @entity12 and his wife @entity60 at her home last year rubbing shoulders : @entity7 , left , and her twin sister @entity63 pose with march @entity64 , then a candidate for @entity65 , in march 2010			1
they only attended his event for the photo , staff said ' i 'm an honorary consul general , so i have inviolability , so they should not be able to cross my property , ' she told the 911 operator			0
' i do n't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well , because that 's against the law to cross my property because , you know , it 's inviolable			0
' but the move backfired - with the police releasing the calls to the media and failing to provide her the protection reserved for those in positions of genuine authority			2
' to put insult to injury , your police dept gave the local 911 tapes to the press ! ' she wrote to @entity31 , adding that the recordings included her cell number , so ' i have been receiving threats all night '			1
' i 'm scared and can not believe what my city , in which i have contributed so much of my love , time , money and leadership , has now done to me and my innocent family , ' @entity7 wrote			1
@entity31 told the @entity30 that he did nothing in response to @entity7 's complaint and simply said that the 911 recordings were public records			1
' fearful ' : she wrote that her surgeon husband @entity109 , pictured returning home on thursday , has had to sleep at the hospital because he is unable to get into the drive because of the media by their house demands : she had earlier asked for diplomatic protection at her $ 1.3 million home in @entity20 he added that he knew the @entity119 socially after he won the mayoral race in march 2011 - even though they did not support him in his bid and he had never met them before			1
emails : @entity7 sent messages to @entity20 mayor @entity31 complaining about her treatment yet just three weeks after he was sworn into office , the doctor and his wife hosted a reception for him at their lavish $ 1.3 million home on @entity132			1
@entity7 has since invited him to a string of social events , including her daughter 's sixth birthday party , which are also documented by email , the @entity30 reported			2
she invited him and his wife to a dinner party for the @entity139 of @entity140 and , after he was unable to attend , she wrote to him again			0
' @entity139 and his sister ( the princess ) are awesome people ! ' she said			0
' actually your name was brought up by the @entity145 when they were showing off the party i hosted you ! ( everyone loved that party )			0
' they met again when he and his wife gave her a ride home following an event at @entity156 , for which she organised events as a volunteer social liaison officer			0
' @entity160 , was so kind to offer , but i realised you two were passing my way , ' she emailed the mayor the following day			2
their messages also show how she involved herself in a spat over a radio host 's claims that he was going to deep fat fry the @entity171 earlier this year , according to the @entity30			0
officers at @entity156 told the mayor that the publicity stunt could harm troops , and asked him to speak with the host			0
socialite : @entity7 kisses @entity12 at an awards ceremony for him at her home last year host : @entity7 , who worked as a volunteer social liaison for the military , with @entity183 and his wife @entity60 close : @entity7 ( second right ) and her twin sister @entity186 ( left ) are pictured with @entity12 , his wife @entity60 and @entity7 's husband @entity109 ( centre ) at a party at their @entity20 home @entity7 also called the mayor to tell them she had been speaking with gen. @entity39 and vice admiral @entity193 , the deputy commander of @entity194 , who said they needed the mayor 's help			1
when @entity31 responded to say it was being dealt with , she said ' they asked me to get involved , like i did when it happened with the pastor last year '			0
@entity7 's shrewd social - climbing tactics also came to light this week when she was pictured with @entity64 and her twin sister , @entity63 , when he was running for the @entity65			2
the photograph was tweeted by @entity206 who said that it was taken at a march 2010 fundraiser , where tickets were $ 1,000			0
who 's who ? a chart shows the connections between the major players in the @entity12 scandal but the twins did n't pay - instead , they appeared , took the photo and left , @entity206 told the @entity30			0
they did not contribute to his campaign			0
yet over the past week , @entity7 's connections have given her more exposure than she was perhaps intending			2
after @entity12 dramatically resigned from the top of the @entity223 last friday , it emerged that @entity7 had played a key role in exposing his affair with his biographer , @entity48			1
in may , @entity7 alerted the @entity227 that she had been receiving threatening , anonymous emails warning her to ' back off ' @entity12 , whom @entity7 and her husband are good friends with			1
the @entity227 was forced to launch an in - depth investigation as some messages contained classified information about @entity12 ' whereabouts , and they feared there could have been a security breach			0
affair : @entity7 tipped off the @entity227 about threatening emails she received from @entity48 , right , and during their investigation they uncovered her affair with @entity12 ' flirty ' : @entity7 allegedly sent ' inappropriate ' emails to gen @entity39 , pictured with his wife and daughter the catty emails were traced back to @entity246 and , in the process of the investigation , agents also uncovered messages revealing the affair between the biographer and @entity12			1
the scandal later dragged in another general , the @entity255 commander in @entity256 , general @entity39 , after the @entity227 investigated @entity7 's emails from @entity246			1
during the probe , they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email correspondence between @entity39 and @entity7 , which officials said were ' flirtatious ' and likened them to ' phone sex '			1
both @entity39 and @entity7 deny any wrongdoing			2
