it was a scout at @entity1 and a former tennis coach who were among the first people to notice @entity5 ’s dazzling footwork			1
his dribbling skills and his speed between the tramlines suggested the new prince of @entity11 could have been equally at home at @entity13 or @entity14			0
‘ so long as there was light , @entity5 would be out in the garden with a rugby ball , tennis ball or a football , ’ said his father @entity21 , who played at outside centre for @entity23 between 1982 and 1986			1
‘ he was one of those kids who could turn his hand to any sport , although there were a few broken windows along the way ! ’ @entity5 scored two tries in @entity31 's @entity32 win against @entity33 the 23 - year - old has been recalled to @entity31 's set up after impressing for @entity36 as a schoolboy in @entity39 , @entity5 ’s first passion was tennis			1
he was offered funding to join the national futures scheme and his mentor , @entity42 , spotted footwork he believes was superior to a young @entity44			1
‘ @entity45 would be running lengths of a hard court and he had the ability to slide like @entity49 or @entity50 , ’ said @entity42			1
‘ i knew @entity44 when he was 12 and @entity45 was the better athlete of the two			1
’ @entity5 ’s introduction to rugby came when his father went to pick up his car from @entity55 on a sunday morning and discovered an under 9s team			1
they went along to training the following week and @entity21 began to coach alongside @entity58 and @entity59 , who was also in charge of @entity62 football club			2
‘ he took to rugby like a duck to water , ’ said @entity63			2
‘ he was a winger in football on saturdays and fly - half in rugby on sundays			1
with football , @entity59 always said @entity5 played better when i was on the touchline			2
there were occasions when he was a bit lazy unless i gave him a verbal kick up the backside			0
’ in his early teens , @entity5 was offered a place at the @entity79 academy before the family relocated from @entity1 to @entity81 for his father ’s work commitments			1
his younger sister , @entity84 , played age - group netball for @entity31 , while @entity5 eventually joined the @entity87 development team			1
@entity5 , pictured with his sister , was a fine tennis player during his early years a young @entity5 pictured playing for @entity89 at a rugby tournament in @entity91 , @entity92 football and rugby took a back seat while @entity5 completed gcses at @entity97 , where the mother of @entity31 ’s @entity99 taught it			1
he also studied dance , becoming a grade a student			0
‘ the dance helped him with his rugby , ’ said @entity63			2
‘ even though he managed to get it all choreographed by a friend who became a professional performer ! ’ a lack of confidence spotted by both @entity110 and @entity63 prompted the family to decide that a private sixth - form education at @entity113 would be best for his sporting talents			2
he continued to work closely with @entity87 youth coach @entity115 amid the realisation that if he was not offered an academy contract he would need a full - time job or to go to university			1
‘ to start with he was n’t mentally tough , ’ said @entity115			0
‘ he was n’t the guy who put his head where it hurts when it was cold or raining			0
if the lads did n’t perform they would empty the kit out of the freight container , clean it with a toothbrush , and then load it back up			0
@entity5 was quite scrawny with a swagger and arrogance that i quite liked			2
‘ himself , @entity133 and the @entity135 brothers ( @entity136 and @entity137 ) would turn up with their baseball caps on back to front			0
’ @entity5 shared an academy house with @entity135 and they were subjected to military - style inspections to ensure cleanliness and discipline			1
strict rules were in place after @entity147 , a previous academy member , set fire to his billets			0
@entity5 ( 2nd right ) poses for a picture with his two brothers @entity152 and @entity154 , sister @entity84 and girlfriend @entity155 @entity5 shared an academy house with @entity157 star @entity135 ‘ we eventually had to split @entity136 and @entity5 up , ’ said @entity115			2
‘ they were good friends but they were both quite laid - back and it was always a case of , “ we ’ll be there in five minutes , do n’t worry ”			0
we had to sit him down and say , “ what do you want to do , @entity5 ? do you want to excel ? ” we were quite strict with the houses , especially after the incident with @entity147 ! ‘ they left some fat in the frying pan and , at training , @entity147 looked up and said , “ that ’s our house — it ’s on fire ! ” ’ @entity5 eventually settled down and , as well as @entity31 age - group honours , went on to break into the senior set - up with @entity87			1
the footwork spotted by dance teachers began to catch the eye again			0
‘ if you had to single out one outstanding attribute it was his feet , ’ said @entity115			0
‘ he could double step you and you would n’t know which way he was going to go			0
he also had enormous fingers — we used to call him @entity186 because he could grip the ball in one hand			0
’ he won six @entity31 caps in 2012 and 2013 before he was lured to @entity36 but his progress slowed and he had to wait almost 20 months before he was recalled for this year ’s @entity32			1
‘ parts of his first season at @entity36 were mediocre , ’ said @entity63			0
‘ i said , “ it looks like six caps are your lot , then ? ” he said to me , “ @entity200 , it ’s all about timing ”			0
with a @entity197 coming up maybe he knew what he was talking about			0
