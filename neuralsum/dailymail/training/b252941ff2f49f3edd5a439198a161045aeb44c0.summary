hairdresser @entity14 found her son @entity15 in his bedroom hours after he had been excluded from school ms @entity14 said she tried calling him later , adding : ' he would n’t answer his phone and i thought " he obviously does n’t want to speak to me "			1
' the hairdresser said she returned to their home in @entity22 , @entity23 , after 8pm and told the inquest : ' i assumed that he was n’t home			0
' i thought he was playing with his friends			0
' medics believe he had been dead several hours when his body was found on june 27 last year			1
today , an inquest in @entity33 , @entity23 , heard how @entity15 , whose mother was separated from his father , @entity36 , had been disruptive even when he was at primary school			1
@entity15 had become increasingly disruptive in lessons since his grandmother died and his parents separated , mrs @entity14 told the hearing			1
when he went to @entity43 , his behaviour became worse , causing him to be excluded from lessons on several occasions			1
@entity15 , seen with his mother , had become increasingly disruptive in lessons since his grandmother died and his parents separated , an inquest heard vice principal @entity47 said staff had had numerous meetings to decide how to help @entity15 , who was academically adept but regularly disrupted classes and swore at teachers			1
on occasions he would just start running round the 800 - student school and hide from staff who were looking for him			1
at one stage he was put in a special educational unit where his behaviour improved			0
but last june the decision was finally made to exclude him from the school for good			1
that morning he had left his home upset after he refused to get out of bed and go to school			1
when he did get there he was put in a ' chill room ' to calm down before he returned to normal lessons			0
miss @entity47 said he was allowed to use the computers in the room and was kept there because he seemed sleepy			0
but just over an hour later @entity15 left the room without permission and a call went out to a special staff response team to find him			2
the schoolboy was permanently excluded from @entity43 on the day he died miss @entity47 said : ' he was seen in different parts of the school but would not stop or listen to anyone			1
' for around half an hour , she admitted staff did not know where @entity15 was until he was seen in the cafeteria but when staff tried to talk to him he was abusive to them and ran away			0
eventually he was persuaded back into the chill room and staff tried to calm him down but he was ' quite difficult and agitated , ' said miss @entity47			0
it was then that the school principal @entity81 decided to exclude @entity15 for a day			2
but when @entity15 realised staff were trying to contact his parents he started shouting ' mum is getting ill ' and began throwing things around , including a board game and a chair			2
miss @entity47 said : ' he was screaming and shouting abuse at staff who decided to leave him in the room to calm down			0
' at one stage another class of pupils were moved out of an adjoining room because they could see what was happening			0
and because of @entity15 ’s behaviour the school principal increased the ban to five days			2
when ms @entity14 was contacted she told the school she could not collect him because she was working - but gave permission for the school to let him return home			2
but then @entity15 's behaviour deteriorated and two members of staff had to stand in front of a glass door as he tried to punch it and then threw himself at it			2
at one stage he picked up a chair and held it above his head , threatening to hit a member of staff with it			0
in an attempt to diffuse the situation miss @entity47 ordered doors to be opened so that @entity15 could leave school after she talked to him and he calmed down			2
moments after leaving school , @entity15 returned to pick up his scooter and minutes later returned again , asking for food and he was given some			0
but after another meeting between staff the principal decided that @entity15 should be excluded from the school permanently			1
after that decision had been made , it would be up to the local authority to decide on @entity15 ’s future			0
miss @entity47 said that suggestions that @entity15 , who lived with his mother , had been bullied were wrong and @entity15 had never reported that he had been bullied			0
