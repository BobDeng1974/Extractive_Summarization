by @entity1 reporter published : 05:54 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 13:24 est , 3 march 2014 serial felon : @entity4 , 46 , whose father is a retired university professor , is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner @entity6 in the neck in her condominium in @entity9 , @entity10 , on january 13 an ex-convict accused of murdering his 84 - year - old neighbour should have been behind bars at the time of her killing ... but was walking free on jail credit that he was not entitled to , it has been reported			1
@entity4 , 46 , whose father is a retired university professor , is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner @entity6 in the neck in her condominium in @entity9 , @entity10 , on january 13			1
but an investigation by the @entity22 has revealed that the former engineering student turned crack addict was given 1,825 days of jail credit that he was n’t allowed under @entity10 law while serving time for a fatal stabbing in @entity29 in 1998			1
he had been in and out of prison for robbery and burglary and had been convicted of a brutal attack on a @entity35 cab driver in 1997 and a fatal stabbing in @entity29 a year later			1
it was for those two crimes that he received the credit , but nobody in either state corrections office could say why			2
' there is nothing that allows him to have credit under the case law of the @entity10 ( for the time he served in @entity35 ) , ' said @entity48 , a spokeswoman for the @entity50 @entity49			1
' there may have been a factual reason to allow him to have the credit , but we do n’t know because the people handling the case do n’t have a memory of it because it ’s so old			0
' had he not been given those 1,825 days of jail credit , his earliest possible release date from prison — based on a formula — would have been february 6 , @entity60 told the @entity22			2
@entity66 , @entity6 ’s daughter , said : ' all the things that he has done and the severity of his crimes ... it does n’t make sense			2
why was he out ? i just do n’t understand it			0
' @entity4 , whose father is a retired professor emeritus of education at @entity77 , comes from a high - flying family including a brother who is an orthopedic - surgeon , sister who is a physician and another sister who is a high - ranking member of the @entity82			0
but while studying for his own degree in engineering at @entity77 , @entity4 began dabbling in crack and soon slid into a life of petty crime to fund his habit , snatching purses and mugging atm users			2
that , however , soon turned to assault and then murder			0
quiet street : mrs @entity6 's body was found around 2:45 p.m. on january 13 inside her condominium on @entity97 in @entity9 , @entity10 in 1997 he attacked @entity99 , a @entity100 driver , after he picked him up in @entity101 , @entity35 , stabbing him in the arm before trying to strangle him with his radio - mic cord			1
the fight spilled out of the cab and @entity4 fled when another motorist approached , leaving @entity99 injured but alive			2
a warrant was put out for his arrest			0
a year later the @entity35 fugitive murdered @entity110 , a small - time drug runner , stabbing him 32 times as he baby - sat a drug house in @entity29 , @entity10			1
he was finally picked up in 1999 in @entity113 , @entity114 for robbery and possession of eight rocks of crack cocaine			0
with warrants in both @entity35 and @entity10 for his arrest , it became a race between authorities in both states to get to get there first and bring him to justice			0
' he should have been located after the warrant was issued — he was n’t , ' @entity10 prosecutor @entity128 said in a statement last week			0
' years later , we should have been able to trump @entity35 in getting him first — we could n’t match their resources			0
' he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2002 to five years in prison and given 883 days of jail credit for time served while waiting for sentencing			1
his @entity35 prison sentence ended in 2005 and he was returned to @entity10 to face charges for @entity110 ’s killing			0
in 2006 , he was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison , receiving credit for 278 days for the time he had spent behind bars waiting to be prosecuted for that killing			0
then , in january 2007 , the @entity148 told @entity4 he had served 942 days in prison there , and had 883 days of credit while he awaited sentencing , for a total of 1,825			1
the next month , @entity4 was allowed to carry over his credit for the time served in @entity35 to his jail time for the @entity10 murder			1
exact details of the deal struck are not clear			0
' so @entity4 ended up getting credit in @entity10 for all the days he served in @entity35 for the attack on @entity99 , ' reports the @entity22			1
' @entity10 authorities ca n’t explain why his jail stay in @entity10 was shortened by the time he was credited on an unrelated case in @entity35			2

@entity4 accused of strangling and knifing @entity6 in january
but he should have been in jail for murder of drug runner in 1998 in @entity29
however , jail time for that crime was shortened because of credit he received for time served for the brutal attack on a @entity35 cab driver in 1997
