getting into character : @entity1 , pictured in @entity2 : appointment with @entity4 , has revealed he squeezes his bottom while walking to perfect the character 's unusual walk actor @entity1 has told of the lengths he went to in order to perfect @entity11 's distinctive walk when he first took the role			1
the actor , 67 , said he wanted to get right his character 's ' rapid , mincing gait ' , as described by @entity11 's creator @entity16			1
@entity1 , who plays the famous detective for the last time in @entity18 : @entity11 's last case later this month , told the @entity20 : ' i took that ( @entity16 's ) description and i practised and practised and practised			1
' @entity23 , when he was playing a fop in a restoration play , wanted to mince ... and famously he put a penny in the crack of his bottom and walked and would n't let it drop			2
if you do that , you ca n't walk fast , so i did the same thing			0
' asked whether he had to use the penny trick for the last 24 years , @entity1 replied : ' no , but what i made myself do when i wanted to walk like @entity11 was to squeeze my bottom			1
' that makes you walk with short strides and that 's all i do			1
if you think of @entity11 and how he walks - that precise little thing is very much who he is			1
he is not a man of broad , relaxed gestures			0
' @entity1 said it was emotional saying goodbye to the mustachioed detective after so long in the role			0
' i quite openly admit that doing @entity11 's final scene was the hardest day 's filming of my career			1
and it was hard because that is the end ... for me , ' he said			0
' i know there 's going to be a new book ( written by @entity54 ) so that 's going to be strange to see him resurrected - depending on where she places him			2
but that will probably be it for me			0
' @entity1 , who said he was about to accept a job offer to become a junior manager at menswear store @entity63 when he was called to say he had been offered a small role in @entity65 , said he had never forgotten what it was like ' to be broke ' before his acting career took off			0
' if you 've got nothing , they say there 's nothing to worry about			2
but not in our society			0
if you 've got nothing , there 's plenty to worry about			2
' those who have n't anything are very aware they have n't and it 's very , very hard for them and it was very hard for me and it was very hard for my wife , ' he added			0
curtain call : @entity1 , pictured in his last episode as @entity11 in the @entity18 with @entity91 as captain @entity92 , played @entity16 's funny little @entity95 detective in adaptations of all her stories over 13 series			1

@entity16 described @entity11 's ' rapid , mincing gait ' in her *novels*
the 67 - year - old actor used @entity16 's description as his *inspiration*
he repeatedly practised walking while squeezing his bottom to achieve the short , precise strides
