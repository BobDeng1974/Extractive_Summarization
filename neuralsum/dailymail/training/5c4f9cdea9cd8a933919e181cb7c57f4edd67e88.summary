by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 06:27 est , 6 august 2013 geologists believe a thick sheet of ice once covering @entity4 could explain the formation of a mysterious type of crater on its surface			1
the unusual double - layered ejecta craters ( @entity10 ) are , like other craters , surrounded by debris			1
but unlike other craters , @entity10 have two individual layers - a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top			1
scientists believe the mysterious double - layer ejecta craters could have formed from blasts on @entity4 ' once icy surface			1
the unusual shape could have been created when ejected material slid down steep crater walls and across ice , creating a top layer			2
grooves , common in landslides on @entity29 , radiate out from the crater rim geologists believe these craters were formed as a result of hundreds of blasts on the @entity4 surface once covered by a layer of ice tens of meters thick			1
by understanding how @entity38 formed , they believe scientists can reconstruct the environmental conditions at the time of impact			0
the findings were made by @entity45 graduate student @entity44 and @entity46 , the university ’s professor of geological science			0
‘ recent discoveries by planetary geoscientists at @entity45 and elsewhere have shown that the climate of @entity4 has varied in the past , ’ said professor @entity46			2
‘ during these times , ice from the polar caps is redistributed into the mid-latitudes of @entity4 as a layer about 50 meters thick , in the same place that we see that the @entity10 have formed			2
‘ this made us think that this ice layer could be part of the explanation for the formation of the unusual @entity10 second layer ’			0
the unusual craters appear at middle or high latitudes on @entity4			2
these are areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on @entity4 millions of years ago double - layered ejecta craters or @entity72 , like other craters , are surrounded by debris excavated by an impactor			1
there are currently over 600 known @entity72 on the @entity4 surface what makes @entity72 different is that the debris forms two distinct layers - a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top			1
these distinctive craters were first documented in data returned from the @entity87 missions to @entity4 in the 1970s , and scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double - layer pattern forms			1
dles appear at middle or high latitudes - areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on @entity4 millions of years ago			2
in this scenario , the impact blasts through the ice layer , spitting rock out onto the surrounding ice			0
because that rock sits on slippery ice , it does n't all stay put			0
@entity44 and @entity46 believe the layering occurs when material near the top of an upraised crater rim slides down the slippery ice and overtops material on the lower slopes			0
that landslide , enabled by steep slopes and a slick ice layer , creates the @entity10 ' two - layered appearance			1
‘ i think for the first time since @entity72 were discovered in the 1970s we have a model for their formation that appears to be consistent with a very wide range of known data , ’ @entity44 said			0
the landslide theory explains the unusual grooves that radiate out from the crater rim of @entity10			0
@entity44 has likened these grooves to the ones found in landslides on @entity29 , especially landslides on glaciers			0
the theory also explains why @entity72 tend not to have secondary craters surrounding them			0
secondary craters are the result of big chunks of ejecta blasted out of the main crater , leaving gouges in the surrounding surface when they land			2
the strange double - layered ejecta craters were first documented in data returned from the @entity87 missions to @entity4 in the 1970s			1
scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double - layer pattern forms but if that surrounding surface was covered by ice , evidence of shallow secondary craters would vanish when the ice disappeared			1
dles appear at middle or high latitudes on mars - areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on @entity4 millions of years ago			2
the scenario also requires a steep slope on the outside of a crater rim			0
a raised rim is partly a function of crater size , with larger craters generally having less uplift			0
@entity44 calculated that craters larger than about 25 kilometres probably would n't have steep enough rims to cause an icy landslide			0
with those results in hand , he surveyed about 600 known @entity72 and found that nearly all of them are between one and 25 kilometres in diameter			0
‘ there are over 600 @entity72 on the @entity4 surface , so reconciling how they formed with our knowledge of the climate of @entity4 is pretty important , ’ @entity44 said			1
‘ it could tell us a lot about the history of the @entity4 climate on a global scale			1

geologists believe double - layered ejecta craters were formed as a result of hundreds of blasts on the once icy surface of @entity4
the craters are unusual in that they have an outer and inner layer of debris
the theory could help reconstruct the history of the @entity4 climate
