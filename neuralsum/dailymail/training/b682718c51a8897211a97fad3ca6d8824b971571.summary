by @entity1 reporter published : 19:26 est , 14 july 2012 updated : 03:25 est , 16 july 2012 he had whipped the crowd into a frenzy by belting out @entity5 as his encore			1
ever the showman , @entity7 then went one better – inviting sir @entity9 on stage for a thrilling finale			1
the veteran rockers performed @entity13 , to the delight of the 76,000 fans massed in @entity16 on saturday night			1
before the stars could deliver their final song , organisers decided to pull the plug – because the event had overrun its allotted time and was in breach of noise regulations			1
with the microphones cut off , the superstars could n't even say a final thank - you to the audience and had to leave the stage in silence			1
among the crowd , confusion soon turned to anger			1
as they shuffled away into the night , fans took to social media to make their disapproval known			1
one called the incident ' @entity49 and roll sacrilege '			1
another tweeted : ' shameful ! @entity7 and @entity9 caught by curfew			1
' the headline act at the @entity21 festival , @entity7 and his @entity24 had been playing for over three hours when the show was brought to a sudden halt			1
it was supposed to end at 10.30pm but it was nearly 11pm when organisers cut the power			1
@entity24 guitarist @entity60 also took to @entity61 to express his outrage			1
he said the stars had planned a final encore number before the sound was cut off			1
the 61 - year - old said : ' one of the great gigs ever in my opinion			2
but seriously , when did @entity70 become a police state ? is there just too much fun in the world ? we would have been off by 11 if we 'd done one more			2
on a saturday night ! who were we disturbing ? cut short : the musicians were forced to leave the stage when they realised their sound had been cut off ' we break curfews in every country but only @entity70 cops needs to " punish us " by not letting us leave until the entire crowd goes			1
' the cops got nothing more important to do ? how about they go catch some criminals instead of f * * * * * * with 80,000 people having a good time ? last night @entity89 confirmed it was the concert organiser @entity90 which ended the show			1
a council spokesman said it did so to comply with its licence , which allowed the event to go on until 10.30pm , adding : ' licences are granted until certain times to protect residents in the area from noise late at night			1
' those in well - to - do @entity105 and @entity106 have badgered the council about noise from concerts in the park			2
there were 109 complaints in 2011 , around twice as many as in 2010			2
a @entity90 spokesman said : ' it was unfortunate it was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities in the interest of the public 's health and safety			2
' @entity123 mayor @entity122 waded into the row , saying the decision to end the show was ' excessively ' officious and if he had been consulted he would have ordered the music should continue			1
rousing set : the rockers performed @entity13 together as @entity9 came onto the stage @entity7 told the delighted revellers : ' i got ta tell you , i 've been trying to do this for 50 years			2
' the pair then delighted the crowds by collaborating on the final songs of @entity7 ’s marathon set			2
however , the musical veterans both found their microphones silenced towards the end of their extended version of @entity143			2
@entity7 did not seem to notice at first , and even attempted to address the crowd one more time			2
but as it became clear that the sound would not be reinstalled , the veteran rocker simply shrugged his shoulders and left the stage as baffled fans looked on			2
@entity7 had apparently been due to finish his set at 10.15pm and was over 30 minutes over the running time			1
' @entity70 cops may be the only individuals left on earth that would n't want to hear one more from @entity7 and @entity9 ! ' audience members that took to @entity61 to express their anger at the decision included actor and comedian @entity161			1
he wrote : ' ashamed to be @entity162 right now			2
@entity7 and @entity9 playing @entity143 in @entity16 and council pulled the plug cos of curfew '			2
' @entity166 : only in @entity162 could a local council pull the plug on the greatest artists of the last 50 years giving it all , ' wrote journalist @entity171			0
the controversial incident has turned @entity123 into an international laughing stock just weeks before the @entity174			1
@entity7 , who played with his @entity24 , had earlier invited @entity176 's @entity175 on stage to perform @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 and singer @entity181 , who played before @entity7 on the main stage , had joined him for @entity183			0
silenced ! @entity7 was unable to address the crowd after his final song when his microphone was cut off after he broke curfew @entity7 delighted the crowd with a 29 song set which lasted over three hours a jubilant @entity7 – who changed his clothes during the show - thrilled the crowds with his set , and often left the stage to shake hands with audience members			1
he sported jeans and a waistcoat over a shirt and at another stage wore a checked shirt			0
he also made the night for one lucky fan who had brought along a banner asking him to play the song take ' @entity203 they come , and listing the concerts around the world where he had requested it			0
fans surely wo n't have minded their idol being unable to address them after the concert , since he had broken curfew by playing 29 songs in over three hours leading to his microphone being cut off taking the banner , @entity7 said ‘ tonight , my friend , this is your lucky night			1
you 're going to hear this damn thing			0
‘ it 's a completely obscure track i wrote for @entity219 when i needed some rock songs			0
’ @entity7 has only performed the song nine times before , the last being almost 10 years ago @entity222 , @entity223 in 2003			0
@entity7 also made the night for one lucky fan who had brought along a banner asking him to play the song take ' em as they come @entity7 ’s encore included fan favourites including @entity230 and @entity5			0
other acts on the main stage included @entity233 , @entity175 and hey @entity234 ! meanwhile @entity235 – who played on the @entity237 stage – was thrilled to meet the man himself			0
she posted a picture of herself with @entity7 on @entity61 , writing ‘ amazing day , amazing night			0
best photo ever ’ @entity235 was thrilled to meet @entity7 backstage @entity7 also sported a check shirt as he took to the stage at @entity21 1			0
