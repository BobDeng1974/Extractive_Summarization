after traveling 30 miles in about six months , the 100 - pound reptile spent another half year with a foster owner before an online ad and a microchip implant recently helped the plumbs get him back			1
according to @entity4 , @entity19 ’s saga began when someone caring for him and the dozens of other animals her family keeps near @entity32 left a gate open			1
@entity4 believes @entity19 first sauntered over to a nearby alfalfa farm before making his 6 - month , 30 - mile trek to @entity36 , where he was adopted by @entity38 engineer and amateur herpetologist @entity39			1

‘ i went all over @entity73 handing out fliers , ( but ) basically all the people who called could n't describe @entity55 , ’ @entity39 said			0
‘ @entity55 's shell was so perfect that he was probably worth a lot of money			0
i really did n't want somebody to come and flip him and put him on @entity80			0
’ meanwhile , the @entity81 posts @entity55 as ‘ pet of the week ’ in the middle of november			2
it turns out @entity50 's hunt was a little off			0
just west of @entity32 , news of a missing tortoise rings alarm bells for @entity21 and @entity4			1
they ca n't find their tortoise anywhere			2
‘ we kind of gave up on the big male , ’ @entity21 said			1
‘ i assumed someone picked him up			0
we did n't worry too much because he was microchipped			0
’ @entity21 drove to @entity36 to inspect @entity55 , and the big sulcata immediately responded to his voice			1
the microchip embedded in the animal 's skin confirmed @entity55 was actually @entity19			1
so , how does a tortoise wander 30 - some miles in six months ? ‘ they are very big explorers , especially the males , ’ @entity4 said			1
the four tortoises at her home like to burrow under fences			0

neighborhood kids and children from churches and schools come to see the animals , more than 73 in all			0
in addition to the tortoises , the plumbs own a wide array of peacocks , guinea hens , chickens and snakes			0
but the male tortoises are special			0
@entity21 rescued one 19 years ago from a busy road , effectively launching his turtle obsession			1
the large land - crawlers even have mates			2
in august , 12 babies hatched from eggs burrowed in the ground			0
the couple intends to give the hatchlings to their future grandchildren			0
they do n't even have grandchildren yet , but their four teenage boys know what 's expected down the road			0
but @entity4 ’s not too worried they 'll stray from the family tradition			2
