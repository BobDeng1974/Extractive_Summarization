the great @entity2 boozer - for many beer - swilling brits it 's a treasured national institution			1
but , new research has claimed the humble pub may have been invented by , of all people , the @entity8			2
according to drinks industry expert and author @entity9 , the first drinking houses to serve paying guests alcohol were set up by @entity15 conquerors just after 1066			1
following @entity18 's victory at the @entity19 , the invaders set up watering holes for visiting @entity8 merchants			0
zut alors ! new research claims the great @entity2 pub is in fact ... @entity8 according to drinks industry expert and author @entity9 pubs originated after the @entity27 in 1066 when the invading @entity8 needed watering holes for their merchants and worse still for those who cherish the more traditional @entity2 ideal , these were wine bars in the @entity34 - not the genteel country tavern we 've become accustomed to			1
they would predate the first @entity39 - style ' alehouses ' by around 150 years , said drinks industry expert and author @entity9 after spending 30 years trying to find @entity2 's oldest pubs			2
after the @entity15 invasion of 1066 , a wave of @entity8 merchants travelled to and from @entity44 to buy and sell wares from the banks of the @entity47			1
the wealthy merchants would arrive at @entity49 , the wharf full of wine warehouses in the @entity34			0

while there are pubs around the country claiming to go back further because they are on sites which may once have served some kind of alcohol			2
but drinks experts continue to argue over what constitutes the first ever pub as we know them today said mr @entity9 , who used to write for the @entity97			0
@entity9 said : ' it ca n't be absolutely proved that the @entity63 originated as a @entity100 wine bar where @entity8 speaking expats chose to hang out			0
' but i ca n't find any trace of anything resembling a pub in @entity106 times , so by a process of elimination i can only conclude - however much i dread to say it - that the @entity15 invented the pub. ' the first alehouse , which would have brewed and sold beer , appears to have arrived much later , in 1212 , in south @entity44 are @entity113 of @entity114			1
