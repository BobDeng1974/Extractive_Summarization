@entity0 could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020 , putting it in direct competition with rivals @entity5 and @entity6 , according to an industry expert			1
evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market , just as it did with smartphones and tablets			1
images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests @entity0 is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years			1
after the first mysterious camera - mounted car was spotted in @entity26 last week , further sightings of @entity0 's minivans have been posted online , with equipment on top ( shown here ) according to @entity30 from @entity18 , automakers ' typically spend five to seven years developing a car '			1
and a 2020 timeframe would underscore @entity0 's ' aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with @entity5 and @entity6 ' both of those are planning to release a sub- Â£ 26,000 ( $ 40,000 ) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles ( 320km ) on a single charge			1
@entity42 , author of ' @entity43 , ' a book about the automotive battery industry , said on @entity46 thursday : ' was @entity6 really going to be able to match @entity5 ? @entity0 can			1
' this latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera - mounted cars registered to @entity0 in the @entity51 last week			1
claims that @entity0 is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity26 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity0 board member @entity59 said that before his death in 2011 @entity61 had considered building a car			1
he told @entity64 : ' @entity61 was gon na design an @entity65			0
' i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' at least two videos - one recorded in @entity26 , another filmed in @entity72 - suggest the top - secret project is more widespread than first thought			2
and rumours range from a @entity77 - style mapping service to an electric car that will rival @entity5 or a self - driving van to rival @entity80			1
the @entity26 footage was sent to @entity82 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity85			2
the @entity72 recording was filmed on a highway in @entity88 and uploaded by @entity89			0

the latest vans have n't officially been confirmed as belonging to @entity0 , but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are			2
the far - reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims @entity0 is developing a mapping service			2
with 12 cameras on top of the car , however , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity80 's @entity77			2
plus , reports recently claimed @entity0 has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. this project has been dubbed ' @entity132 '			1
this @entity0 research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away - and is being overseen by @entity0 designer sir @entity135			1
@entity0 could , of course , be using the vans for both projects			2
the @entity139 added that hundreds of employees are working on the @entity132 project and boss @entity142 approved the project close to a year ago			0
the @entity26 footage ( pictured ) was sent to @entity82 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity85 these reports followed rumours that @entity0 was developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity5 a run for its money			1

' it followed sightings of an @entity0 - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in @entity26 in particular , @entity0 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity5 's range ( the @entity173 is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced @entity177 in - car control system that would rival @entity5 's software the head of self - driving cars for @entity80 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity183 said the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity80 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity183 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity194 in @entity195 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
he told @entity64 : ' @entity61 was gon na design an @entity65			0

@entity80 launched its @entity77 technology in 2007 , and has refined the technology ever since ( @entity77 screenshot near @entity238 in @entity239 pictured right ) alternatively , the vehicles spotted in @entity26 and @entity72 could be self - driving cars			2
the cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software , for example			0
if @entity0 was developing such systems , they would would rival @entity80 's self - driving cars ( pictured )			1

@entity18 has claimed that @entity0 could have a car ready by 2020
the tech giant is thought to be preparing to enter the automobile industry
recent images showed a car registered to @entity0 with equipment on top
they may be preparing an electric car to go head to head with @entity5
other reports claim @entity0 is building a self - driving car called ' @entity132 '
