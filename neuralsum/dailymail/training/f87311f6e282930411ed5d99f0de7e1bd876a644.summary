she and her friends have now received a pay - out from the insurers of the bar responsible , more than two years after their harrowing ordeal			2
ordeal : @entity5 was poisoned by a cocktail which had been contaminated by bleach miss @entity5 , 22 , was out with her mother and friends in february 2011 at the @entity24 and @entity25 bar in @entity26 , which has since closed down			1
one of the group ordered a pink kangaroo , made with tequila , vodka , cider , cranberry juice and orange juice			2
tests later established that the drink had been contaminated with bleach , which is frequently used for cleaning bar pipes			1
one woman vomited immediately after taking a gulp , while others suffered throat burns and ran to the toilet to wash out their mouths			0
miss @entity5 said : ' i went in the toilets and my friend was nearly passed out because she had swallowed her sip all the way down			1
' the police were called and i gave my drink to the officer			0
by this time everyone was getting burns and i had bleach stains on my black dress			0
