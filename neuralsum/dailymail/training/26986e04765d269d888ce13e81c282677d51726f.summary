by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:12 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 06:55 est , 23 november 2012 @entity2 could give convicts life bans which prevent them from voting even after they have left prison			2
justice secretary @entity7 published a draft bill containing three options for resolving the @entity2 ’s long - running stand - off with @entity11 over granting prisoners the vote			1
these were giving votes to inmates who have been imprisoned for up to four years , for up to six months or , crucially , maintaining the @entity2 ’s existing blanket ban			1
however , mr @entity7 said he also wanted the committee to consider other ideas , including the system operated by the @entity35 government , which has been ruled lawful by the @entity36			1
under this regime , prisoners given shorter sentences are entitled to vote while behind bars			1
but anyone sentenced to five years or more - such as rapists and killers - are stripped of their right to vote forever , subject to a right of appeal			1
it would mean mps swallowing the idea of thousands of convicts voting by post while in jail , in return for far tougher treatment of @entity2 ’s worst criminals upon release			1
@entity57 , attorney general , has warned @entity2 could become a ¿ pariah ¿ currently , ex-offenders are free to take part in elections as soon as they are released			1
in a @entity63 statement , mr @entity7 said : ‘ the @entity35 system , found to be compliant by the @entity36 , disenfranchises prisoners post-release			1
@entity67 will i am sure consider evidence on this and other approaches			2
’ the @entity2 government had been given until today by @entity11 - dubbed a ‘ @entity72 court by @entity24 yesterday - to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting			2
@entity24 - led by the prime minister , who said prisoner voting made him feel ‘ physically ill - have repeatedly made it clear they want to defy the court and keep the blanket ban in place			0
mr @entity7 is hoping to end the stand - off - or at least buy more time - by giving mps a fresh vote on what happens next			1
but @entity87 , the former policing minister , said @entity2 should withdraw from membership of the @entity90 court , as it is ‘ doubtful that any of the three main options presented to @entity92 will actually be acceptable to @entity11			0
he predicted that the @entity36 would start awarding prisoners compensation , and the public would find that even harder to ‘ stomach ’			0
thousands of prisoners are lining - up to claim compensation , worth £ 1,000 each , if @entity11 rules it is not satisfied with @entity2 ’s response			0
mr @entity7 suggested he could block prisoners getting access to legal aid to help them mount their legal challenges			1
however mps fear that will not prove a deterrent to ‘ ambulance chasing ’ lawyers who are prepared to offer their services on a no - win , no - fee basis			0
@entity110 said it did not want any inmates to have the vote			2
justice secretary @entity7 is considering a variety of options in regards to the thorny subject of prisoners ' votes but @entity119 , a @entity121 peer and prominent barrister , said the @entity2 must be seen to comply with the law			1
he claimed : ‘ this diminishes our reputation across the world , whether in @entity128 or @entity129 , and makes me feel sick			0
’ @entity57 , the attorney general , has himself warned @entity2 could become a ‘ pariah ’ if it does not obey @entity11			0
but mr @entity7 hit back : ‘ some people have suggested that if @entity92 chooses to exercise its right of sovereignty the @entity2 will become a pariah state			1
i simply do not accept that			0
‘ i believe that @entity92 has the right to exercise its sovereignty , it will be for @entity92 to decide in this situation whether it wishes to exercise that sovereignty			0
‘ but i do not believe that if it chooses to do so somehow @entity2 will turn into a nation with an appalling human rights record			0
our human rights record stands comparison with anyone			0
’ mr @entity7 said it would be up to mps whether to pay any compensation ordered by @entity90			1
@entity150 mps made stinging attacks upon the court for meddling in @entity2 ’s affairs			0
@entity154 said the @entity155 was drafted to ensure that the horrors of @entity157 could not be repeated			0
he added : ‘ it was never the intention of the framers to give @entity160 and @entity161 the vote			2
’ fellow backbencher @entity163 applauded mr @entity7 for seeking to make ‘ this @entity92 sovereign and ignoring a @entity72 court in @entity90			1
’ however , the @entity167 ’s @entity166 made it clear the court was in no mood to tolerate further delays			0
@entity172 said : ‘ it ’s been seven years since the initial judgment , so a long time has passed since the ruling and the government has asked for extensions , so we would like to see the judgment implemented			2
‘ the @entity2 decided to delegate some small part of its sovereignty to the @entity167 when it joined and when it agreed to abide by the rulings of the court			2
’ the committee is expected to begin examining the options next year - a process that could take a year or more			0
when mps finally get a vote , cabinet ministers have been told to abstain by mr @entity57 , who does not want to further infuriate @entity11 .			2

@entity7 is considering a system where those who are jailed for five years or more lose the right to vote forever , subject to appeal
currently , ex-offenders are free to take part in elections subject to release
