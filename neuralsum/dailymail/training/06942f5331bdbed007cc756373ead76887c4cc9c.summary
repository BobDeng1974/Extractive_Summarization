the lesbian daughter of a @entity2 billionaire who has offered hkd $ 1bn in ' dowry ' to the man who married her , has told him that she will marry a man when he does			1
@entity6 , 34 , previously laughed off her father 's scheme to find a man for her , but has now gone public with her plea for him to understand that she is gay , and that if it is as easy as he thinks to change her sexual orientation , he should lead by example			1
earlier this month , @entity15 , a 77 - year - old property magnate , insisted that @entity6 was ' still single ' , despite the fact that she married her long - term partner @entity18 two years ago			1
scroll down to read the letter in full daddy - daughter day : @entity6 has written an open letter to her father @entity15 , who offered hkd $ 1bn ( £ 80million ) in ' dowry ' to any man who marries her , asking him to accept that she is lesbian happy couple : @entity6 , right , asks her father to ' not be terrified ' of her partner @entity28 , left , whom she married in a civil ceremony two years ago , and to ' treat her like a dignified human being ' following the publication of an open letter to her father , ms @entity6 went even further saying she will enter a straight marriage , when her father enters a gay one			1
' since @entity37 thinks it 's so easy for me to switch from gay to straight , i should just leave it for him to demonstrate			1
i think i 'll marry a man when he marries a man , ' the told the @entity43			2
in the letter published by @entity45 , ms @entity6 reaches out to her father , asking for him to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian			1
in the letter , which starts ' @entity49 ' , ms @entity6 explains that although her love for him has not changed , the time has come for her father to accept her sexual orientation and her partner , @entity18 , whom she has been with for nine years			1
' i must have misled you to hope there were other options for me , ' she writes			2
definitely not single : @entity6 , right , and her partner @entity18 , have been together for nine years and married in @entity59 in 2012 in denial : @entity2 billionaire mr @entity6 , who claims to have slept with 10,000 women , still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he wo n't force her ' i know it ’s difficult for you to understand how i could feel romantically attracted to a woman ; i suppose i ca n’t really explain it either			1
it just happens , peacefully and gently , and after so many years , we still love each other very much			1
' now , i ’m not asking you to be best of friends ; however , it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her [ partner @entity18 ] , and treat her like a normal , dignified human @entity77 understand it is difficult for you to understand , let alone accept this truth			1
' ' i ’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who i am , what is important in my life , who i love and how best to live life , as an expression of all these questions			2
' i am proud of my life , and i would not choose to live it any other way ( except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet )			2
' i ’m sorry to mislead you to think i was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good , suitable men in @entity2			2
' there are plenty of good men , they are just not for me			2
' deal : ms @entity6 offered to comply with the terms , as long as the man in question donated a large part of the ' reward ' to her charity , and did not mind that she already has a wife video : @entity6 reads some of her marriage proposals ... yes , she 's still close with her father ... ms @entity6 married her long - term partner @entity28 in a church ceremony in @entity59 in early 2012 , but it was not until news of their union was printed in the @entity2 tabloids that her father promised the million @entity120 fortune to any potential male suitor able to walk @entity6 down the aisle			1
ms @entity6 had already told her father about her wedding , and said he was ‘ surprised and unpleasantly shocked , ’ but urged her not to make it public			1
when the plea for a man for @entity6 spread over the world , the offers came pouring in			1
‘ war veterans from the @entity133 , someone from @entity135 , from @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , really just from all over the world , ’ ms @entity6 said			1
' one @entity133 suitor wrote : " i ’m interested in the offer			1
i am a male person , who also happens to be gay "			1
' ms @entity6 , an executive director at her father ’s property development company , part - time pilot , and founder of anti-poverty charity @entity147 , has maintained throughout her father 's persistent quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern			1
' i understand that he loves me , it ’s just he ’s from another time and it ’s difficult for him to understand the plight of the @entity160			2
' at the office it ’s business as usual			2
at family gatherings we hug and dance			2
and we just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is			2
' @entity49 , i thought the timing was right for us to have a candid conversation			0
you are one of the most mentally astute , energetic yet well mannered and hard - working people this humble earth has ever known			0
your confidence , quick wit , and charisma brightens any room you enter			0
i love you very much , and i think i can speak for my brothers also , that we have the utmost respect for you as a father and role model in business			1
i am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately			0
the truth is , they do n’t understand that i will always forgive you for thinking the way you do , because i know you think you are acting in my best interests			0
and we both do n’t care if anybody else understands			0
as your daughter , i would want nothing more than to make you happy			1
but in terms of relationships , your expectations of me and the reality of who i am , are not coherent			0
i am responsible for some of this misplaced expectation , because i must have misled you to hope there were other options for me			0
you know i ’ve had male lovers in the past , and i ’ve had happy , albeit short - lived , relationships			0
i found myself temporarily happy , buoyed by the freshness , the attention , the interest , of someone physically stronger than myself			0
but it was always short - lived , as i quickly lost patience , and felt an indescribable discomfort in their presence			0
it usually made me frustrated , and i would yearn for my freedom again			0
i ’ve broken a few hearts , hearts of good , honest and loving men , and i ’m sorry that it had to be so			0
but with @entity28 , a woman , somehow it was different			0
i am comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her			0
i know it ’s difficult for you to understand how i could feel romantically attracted to a woman ; i suppose i ca n’t really explain it either			0
it just happens , peacefully and gently , and after so many years , we still love each other very much			1
my regret is that you have no idea how happy i am with my life , and there are aspects of my life that you do n’t share			0
i suppose we do n’t need each other ’s approval for our romantic relationships , and i am sure your relationships are really fantastic too			0
however , i do love my partner @entity28 , who does a good job of looking after me , ensuring i am fed , bathed and warm enough every day , and generally cheering me up to be a happy , jolly girl			1
she is a large part of my life , and i am a better person because of her			0
now , i ’m not asking you to be best of friends ; however , it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her , and treat her like a normal , dignified human @entity77 understand it is difficult for you to understand , let alone accept this truth			2
