she said : ' my boyfriend broke up with me two years ago			2
i was n’t feeling good and i ’ve been single since then			2
' it was pretty frustrating but dating has significantly increased since i lost the weight			1
now i ’m going on my first date for two years			2
@entity0 is now filled with confidence and excited to be dating again ' a man who i was in love with has come back and said he is now interested in me			1
' lots of other people i used to like have come back to me and asked me out as well but i tell them all the same thing - you snooze , you lose			2
' you could have had this amazing , witty , thin girlfriend with a great personality			2
but it ’s too late , you had your chance			2
' when i got to size 16 , loads of lads at work started complementing me			1
' at size 12 - the offers of dates started coming in and random people started asking me out on facebook			1
' due to being overweight for so long , i am actually quite shy and not used to people complimenting me on how i look but i am now slowly beginning to enjoy it			0
@entity0 has now started to become a little braver and is taking a few of these suitors up on their offers , and she is on the look out for mr @entity74			1
' it is fair to say i have been pretty unlucky in love to date so i ’m excited to see if the increase in volumes also brings with it an increase in calibre			0
' i am excited about dating now because i also think i will pick better , as when i look back now i think i have always felt like i am not good enough in relationships and this has meant that i have not always spoken up when i have been unhappy about something possibly because i am scared they will leave			0
' when you ’re fat you ’re invisible			0
even now i still feel fat in my mind because i lost the weight so quickly			1
a man who she was once in love with has even come running back ' the extra attention i ’m now getting was scary as hell			0
i ’m not used to people commenting on my body			0
another reason for her changing her attitude towards her weight was when her father fell ill with a kidney infection			0
added to that , one of her best friends was diagnosed and battling with terminal cancer , which changed her outlook on life			0
' it gave me the wake up call i needed to recognise that even though i have always given the impression of being confident and happy being overweight and feeling unattractive has been holding me back for years			0
@entity0 's friends ca n't believe the difference , @entity0 lost weight by slimming on just 500 calories a day ' people always tell you that in your 30s all you spend your time doing is going to births , deaths and weddings and that has definitely been true , but having been single for two years now i have found myself playing the @entity123 character in @entity124 going to these events alone			1
' watching friends getting married and having children has only reminded me that i have always wanted those things and at the age of 34 and spending lots of time focusing on my career i seem no closer to achieving them			0
' for the first time ever i now love shopping , as i do not have to go to fat shops , and can buy things off the rack and know that it will fit			0
in just six months @entity0 dropped an incredible 12 dress sizes and six stone in weight ' when you are overweight shopping in special shops is not good for your confidence and the choice is limited , ' she said , since she started the @entity147 diet programme , @entity0 eats about a fifth of what she used to eat and only eats their specific food packs which equate to 500 calories a day			1
since she has ditched her original diet of chocolate , cheese and pizza , she feels much healthier and happy and visits the gym three times a week			0
' since losing the weight i ’m happier , more confident and believe anything is possible			0
