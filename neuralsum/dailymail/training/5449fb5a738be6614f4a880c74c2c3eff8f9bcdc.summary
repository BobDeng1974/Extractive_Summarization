by @entity0 is there anything more pointless than a @entity4 opening ceremony ? joining the league against the march of the unstoppable @entity7 perhaps ? trying to find where the money ’s gone again ? putting the toothpaste back in the tube ? the olympic flame lighting gala is part of the wonder of the event			1
fortunes are spent , the biggest names are hired			2
histories unfold and the @entity19 rock out			0
by contrast , there will be 18th birthday parties in @entity23 this weekend that have more wit and imagination than this			0
trio : @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 perform during the opening ceremony of the @entity4 in @entity31 start : @entity28 acknowledges the crowd after singing the official @entity4 song ' we are one ( @entity35 ) ' alongside @entity27 high notes : @entity37 performs during the opening ceremony of the @entity4 where the @entity40 ball was before it split into segments there were plenty of perfectly viable ways to start this @entity4 — the ceremonial beheading of various disgraced @entity47 executive committee members , for instance — but @entity49 2014 went for the usual			1
a cast of hundreds twirling colourfully but to no real purpose , representing the same old cliches that bear about as much resemblance to the true soul of @entity49 as @entity57 dancers would cut to the heart of old @entity59			1
still , it was good to see the spirit of @entity62 rekindled in the dancers with what appeared to be footballs for heads			0
they resisted the opportunity to do @entity62 ’s own @entity4 song , three shirts on the line — a pulsating tale of the time his ball went over next door ’s fence — but you ca n’t have everything			1
all opening ceremonies have a central theme , though , and this was no exception			2
nature , people and football — ‘ @entity49 ’s greatest treasures , ’ according to @entity47 , who would know a bit about plundering them — were the subject of this one , which included 660 dancers , floaters and others just standing for large parts of the process wondering how hot it could get inside a giant football head before a person passed out			2
as ever , the action was ripe with hidden meaning			0
in the mood : @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity27 perform on the central stage in @entity102 ahead of the @entity4 opener between @entity49 and @entity104 the @entity4 stage : the @entity40 ball split into segments to allow @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 to perform during the opening ceremony looking on : a @entity49 fan waits for the start of the @entity112 match against @entity104 , which the host nation won 3 - 1 a mix of all kinds : a @entity117 fan looks on while wearing his eccentric peacock - feathered headdress during the opening ceremony in @entity102 many had the tall folk on stilts down as representing the trees of the @entity124 rainforest , but those of a more creative bent will have instantly spotted the subtle representation of @entity59 ’s back four against @entity128 in @entity129			1
the same stilted sideways movement , uncannily similar pace			0
maybe the trees turned quicker and had a better positional sense , but there is always a degree of artistic licence where these festivals are concerned			0
soon after , dancers in national costumes old and new celebrated together , some performing somersaults and cartwheels , representing the joy that is felt among the various members of @entity144 when the bloke from @entity146 turns up with a sackload of readies			0
more formally attired attendants represented the lawyers telling journalists they ca n’t make jokes like that , because nothing of this nature has been proven			0
and that they ’re racists , probably			0
it really was a most heart - warming scene			0
meanwhile , extras dressed as flowers , sprouts , sprites and other stuff you pick out of a salad stood around doing , well , nothing really			0
everyone was waiting for @entity167 - @entity166 peace : a @entity49 fan waves the peace sign during the opening ceremony and another two supporters give a thumbs up as @entity28 performs in @entity102 @entity174 and mirth : fans watch on as the @entity4 gets underway with an opening ceremony at the @entity31 on thursday before kick - off all smiles : @entity49 fans were certainly up for the opening ceremony as they watched on ahead of the @entity49 v @entity104 clash in @entity112 there is always a big ticket item at opening ceremonies and @entity186 was @entity49 ’s			1
all week , stories have circled : would she turn up , if she did would she perform or mime , is there genuinely nobody in a country populated by close to 200million that can carry a tune without having to import mundane duds from the @entity196 ? and then she appeared , ruined @entity198 ’s wonderful @entity197 — the only vaguely @entity49 music on offer — and was shortly joined by @entity27 to do the same to other @entity47 endorsed dirges too miserable to mention			1
@entity203 , it was rotten stuff , although all involved seemed very pleased with themselves			0
at the end they disappeared into a hole in what appeared to be an overripe mango , which was strangely appropriate			0
a little awkward ! @entity27 helps @entity28 out of the elevated paltform that seemed to get stuck on its way up proud : a female @entity49 fan shows off her colours at the @entity215 of the @entity4 ahead of the @entity49 and @entity104 clash in @entity102 fans cheer before the start of the first group a match between @entity49 and @entity104 , as the opening ceremony seemed to get them in the mood performers dance during the @entity223 at @entity31 on june 12 so what was the stadium like ? was it ready ? was if functioning ? mostly			1
the helicopters circling overhead told a different @entity4 story , one of resentment and unrest , but nothing fell down , so by the standards of modern tournament organisation , this equates to a triumph			1
the @entity31 is another of those @entity47 - endorsed projects that goes down so well in countries whose citizens still dwell in slums			0
@entity102 , the club and the city , had a perfectly passable 67,000 - capacity stadium in town that needed modernisation			1
instead , @entity47 insisted on a new ground and this was built to the east of the city for @entity102 ’s great rivals @entity250 , huge and white , with fabulous views of the local poverty			2
home : a fan kisses a fake @entity4 trophy ahead of the match between tournament - favourites @entity49 and @entity104 packed : the general view of the arena during the opening ceremony as fans piled in to see @entity49 v @entity104 a festival of colour : the opening ceremony did not disappoint in terms of colour as its huge selection of dancers had their costumes at the ready performers take part in the opening ceremony of the 2014 @entity273 at the @entity274 in @entity102 there was bunting hanging from the houses nearby but it had seen better days			1
@entity49 is a hot country and material quickly fades , but even so this looked as if it had been put up some time ago in an attempt to affect enthusiasm for the project , rather than in a frenzy of anticipation as the @entity4 drew near			1
maybe this will change as the competition progresses and @entity49 with it , but right now the idea of football returning to its spiritual home feels like a headline more than a truth			2
those inside the stadium were noisy , enthusiastic and clearly good to go , but the rest of the country is still asking what the @entity4 can do for them			1
they ’ll hang out the bunting when they have something to bunt about .			2

@entity4 opening ceremony marks the start of the 2014 tournament in @entity49
@entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 performed at the in @entity102
@entity307 opened against back drop of @entity309 bribe controversy and civil unrest in host nation
awkward moment when @entity27 had to help @entity28 out of a rising *platform* that got stuck
even the bunting hung up around the stadium had faded
