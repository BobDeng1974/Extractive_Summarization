@entity0 is refusing to rule @entity1 out of sunday 's crunch clash against @entity3			1
the @entity5 centre forward has missed the last two games with a hamstring problem and was even admitted to hospital this week with a virus			1
but @entity0 , who confirmed @entity10 would miss the next three weeks with a groin problem , says his star striker has a chance of making the visit to @entity15			1
@entity1 has a little chance , the same as @entity31 and ( @entity32 ) @entity32			1
' but @entity10 is out - he will not play			1
' everything happened ( to @entity1 )			1
he was obviously injured - that was hamstring			2
he had to go to hospital with a viral situation that we did n't manage to resolve without being in hospital over one night - that was before @entity20			2
' against @entity20 he would n't have been ready from the injury , no chance			1
but being ill did n't help the recovery process because we did n't have him at @entity45 ( training ground )			0
medical staff had to go to his house because we did n't want to bring him here with a viral situation			0
' he trained individually , not yet with us			0
' @entity50 , meanwhile , has had no reaction to his 75 minutes against @entity20 in the @entity52 and could play			2
@entity0 also confirmed that @entity53 will get the nod in goal			1
@entity50 , in action against @entity20 on tuesday , is operating at less than 100 per cent right now @entity57 ( right ) gave @entity18 an early lead against @entity59 last week by scoring a wonderful free - kick @entity61 doubled @entity18 's lead at @entity63 early in the second half last weekend the @entity65 are unbeaten in the @entity66 - having won seven and drawn one of their eight matches so far - and the @entity71 believes his squad are confident heading up to the @entity73 for sunday 's tie			1
he was quick , however , to insist his team ' share nothing ' with @entity80 's @entity79 side of 2003 - 04 despite comparisons			0
' we are playing well , we are confident , top of the league and in a good position to qualify for the @entity52			2
the camp is happy and we are ready for the game , ' he continued			2
' i only have positive news ! ' @entity0 says his side are focused ahead of trip to @entity15 but will give @entity3 the respect they deserve @entity0 will go head - to - head with his former boss @entity94 at @entity15 but he is concentrating on picking up the three points			1
he said : ' i like to go to @entity15 and i like to play there			1
i 've been there with @entity97 , @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity100 and @entity18 and i like to go there and play there			1
. ' @entity94 was important			0
he gave me a good opportunity to work at a high level , as a young coach to be working four consecutive years , one with @entity108 ( @entity107 ) @entity106 and three with @entity109 in a club like @entity111 is very important			0
' if i had to choose important people in my career for sure he 's one			0
@entity114 ( bottom ) will not feature for @entity18 after being sent off against @entity59 last week @entity57 ( far left ) is congratulated by his @entity18 team - mates for his brilliant dead ball strike against @entity59 and @entity0 believes his side will show @entity3 the respect they deserve , but they will not go there scared			1
@entity18 's wonderful start to the season gives them some momentum			1
he said : ' we will respect one of the best and most difficult opponents in the league , but we 're confident and in a good moment and situation			2
there 's no reason to change our positive feeling			0
' we play a big team , yes , but we 're in a good moment and going to discuss the points and try the best result			2
' but we are not going to @entity15 to get a point - we are heading there to win			2
' i want to fight for three points but sometimes during a game a point is a positive result			0
' @entity0 ( right ) and @entity143 before last week 's game - but the latter was not happy with some decisions interestingly , @entity0 also claimed he does not see former @entity18 midfielder @entity147 as a ' special player '			1
@entity147 was sold to @entity3 in january by @entity0 and he believes although the @entity149 did a ' good job ' for @entity18 , he was not a ' special player '			1
' for me @entity147 is a very good player and i look at him as a very good player			0
i do n't look at him as a special player because of certain circumstances			0
' because if i did there would have been 20 , 30 , 40 players who we sold or decided to leave			0
for me not a problem			0
' he a very good player and very good players are dangerous			0
' how the two teams lined up in last season 's goalless draw			0
* players who have now left their respective clubs			0

@entity18 travel to @entity15 to face @entity3 on sunday
@entity65 boss @entity0 says the players are ' ready and confident '
@entity1 has a ' chance ' to play , but @entity10 will not play
