by @entity0 published : 04:17 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 14:21 est , 20 december 2012 a blogger has claimed that the @entity3 video showing an eagle ' swooping in ' on a toddler and trying to fly off with him is a hoax			1
the viral video is the work of some creative students at the @entity11 - based @entity10			1
a blog post owned up to the fact that the video was the work of pupils studying the school 's @entity17 and @entity19			2
in the video , a massive golden eagle circles a park before swooping down and appearing to grab a toddler with its claws and trying to fly off with him			2
footage then shows the eagle dropping the child , whose name and age are unknown , on the grass a few feet away			0
however , @entity3 posters suggested the video is an elaborate hoax with several claiming to have proved it 's a fake			1
the students took to a blog to explain how they fooled their astonished audience			2
' both the eagle and the kid were created in 3d animation and integrated into the film afterwards , ' the school wrote , revealing that students @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 were behind the clip			1
@entity3 user lonelygirl15 fooled fans into thinking on a videoblog about the life of teenager @entity75 was real - when actually it was the work of a 19 - year - old actress named @entity77			0
hoaxers convinced many people into plugging their @entity81 charger into an onion , dazzling them some questionable ' scientific facts ' to persuade them you could charge an @entity85 with the vegetable a tearful confession about a love for cats by a woman called @entity91 drew a huge - if mocking - audience			0
but dating website @entity93 admitted the heartfelt tribute was a hoax			2
' the production simulation workshop class , offered in fifth semester , aims to produce creative projects according to industry production and quality standards , ' the blog added			0
the @entity10 boasts that it has trained more than 1,500 @entity104 professionals since it opened its doors in 1992			1
this is n’t the first time @entity10 ’s work has created a buzz : students in the program have previously created hoax videos that have also gone viral , including one showing an escaped penguin from the @entity113			1
video of the apparent incident starts with footage of the eagle - with a roughly six - foot wing span - flying over a public park in @entity11 , @entity119			2
but when the eagle swoops down the @entity122 - speaking man filming the incident zooms in			0
after swearing in @entity124 , he races over to comfort the bewildered child , who starts crying but does not appear to have been seriously hurt			0
' a golden eagle tries to snatch a baby in @entity11 ! what if he got away with it ! ? ' reads a caption under the video , posted by @entity134			0
the video had more than five million views by wednesday evening			0
however , many @entity3 posters were already suspicious before the blog revealed it was a fake , realising that it was a @entity104 hoax			1
one user @entity140 broke the video down and claimed special effects were used to fake it and there is lack of shadow in some frames			0
the golden eagle is the largest bird of prey in @entity152 , and can dive at its quarry at speeds of more than 150 miles per hour , according to the @entity156 @entity155			1
the clip starts with footage of a golden eagle flying over a public park in @entity119 the camera follows the eagle as it swoops down near the ground , and towards a child , seen here in the centre this is the moment the giant eagle grabs the child by his winter coat as he sits on the grass in a park incredibly , the bird takes off with the child in its claws , lifting it a couple of feet off the ground			0
at this point the parent has n't noticed horrifying : the parent notices and and tries to run after the eagle , but there is little anyone can do the eagle , pictured showing it 's huge wingspan , loosens its grip on the child and drops it from a few feet in the air back down to earth : the child falls down onto the grass as the eagle , who must have mistaken the little boy for prey , flies off after the incident : thankfully the child was n't seriously hurt by the eagle , although the child does look shaken			1

the whole *sequence* was an elaborate hoax using @entity104 images
students created video showing bird of prey ' snatching the boy '
