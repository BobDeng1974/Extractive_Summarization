by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 16 december 2013 a rail firm has become the first to announce a freeze on 43 per cent of its fares for 2014 - including more than half of journeys to and from @entity7			1
but @entity10 - run @entity8 , which runs to the @entity11 and @entity12 , said regulated fares , which include season tickets , will rise by 3.1 per cent			1
a spokesman said : ‘ fares on 43 per cent of all journeys will be frozen next month , with fares on tickets booked in advance frozen for 64 per cent of all journeys			1
’ government - run @entity8 , which runs between @entity7 and @entity11 and @entity12 , has become the first to announce a freeze on 43 per cent of its fares for 20134 this is in sharp contrast to the oft - quoted ‘ real terms freeze ’ in which fares go up only by the rate of inflation - which still means ticket prices rise			1
the company said there would be some increase below or up to the rate of inflation on 51 per cent of fares			0
and 6 per cent of tickets would see an above inflation rise , it said			0
the line was taken over by the @entity41 in 2009 after franchise holder @entity42 decided it cost too much to run			1
@entity8 managing director @entity44 said : ‘ we ’re freezing fares to encourage more people to travel with us			2
this will help us to continue to grow our business , and to give back even more to the taxpayer			0
‘ this is a straightforward commercial decision which is very good news for our customers and businesses across our route			1
it will also help @entity8 to sustain our strong advantage in a highly - competitive travel market			2
' when you take into account the rate of inflation , [ the ] announcement represents a genuine real terms cut in our overall fares			0
the company said it was a ' commercial decision ' and hoped it would attract more passengers ( file picture ) ' we believe this will attract more people to our trains , and help to maximise revenue			1
it will also help businesses and hard - working people by holding down the cost of travel for many			2
‘ @entity8 operates services from @entity7 up the east side of @entity79 to @entity80 , with about 60 per cent of services starting or finishing at @entity7 ’s @entity82			1
overall average rise for all @entity8 fares from january 2 will be 1.21 per cent			2
unregulated fares - which include off - peak fares and advanced - purchased tickets for leisure travellers - will go up by an average of 0.83 per cent			0
regulated fares , including season tickets , will rise by 3.1 per cent next year after an announcement by @entity93 but regulated fares , which include season tickets , are rising by the recently - agreed 3.1 per cent average which is in line with the july 2013 @entity99 inflation rate on which the january 2014 national rises are based			2
this follows the announcement in chancellor @entity93 ’s recent @entity104 statement that january 2014 ’s rail fare rise for regulated fares - which include season tickets - would be capped and limited to the retail or @entity99 rate of inflation rather than ‘ @entity99 plus 1per cent ’			0
the rises will now be based solely on the inflation - rate rate in july 2013 , which means that the average rise in january 2014 will be 3.1 per cent rather than the expected 4.1 per cent			0
however , train operators still have flexibility to increase fares by a further 2 percentage points to 5.1 per cent , - provided other fares fall to compensate and keep the overall average at 3.1 per cent			0
mr @entity93 said his decision would benefit more than 250,000 annual season ticket holders who will , on average in 2014 , save £ 25			0
passenger focus executive @entity124 said : ‘ hard - pressed passengers will welcome @entity8 ’s decision to freeze nearly half of all its fares , including more than half of those to or from @entity7			1
’ and @entity132 transport union leader @entity131 said other rail companies who have made ‘ massive profits down the years from ripping off passengers ’ should follow suit			0
he added : ‘ we would like to see all fares frozen because they have more than doubled since privatisation 20 years ago			1

government - run @entity8 said freeze was ' commercial decision '
64 *%* of booked in advance journey fares will also be frozen
government took over running of line between @entity7 and @entity11 and @entity12 after @entity42 decided it cost too much to run
