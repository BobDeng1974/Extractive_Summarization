by @entity0 @entity2 ’s phone suffered a meltdown the other week			1
he was in @entity4 on holiday , enjoying a sports - free friday night in the @entity7 tourist mecca , when he received the same advice from numerous people			1
check out the @entity11 incident in the @entity12 versus @entity14 match was the suggestion			1
he did and what he saw appalled him			2
rugby across the board is supposed to have cottoned on to the fact that concussion is no good for any player and a concussed player is no good for any team , but what happened at @entity26 made a complete mockery of the supposedly - increased surveillance			1
protest : @entity29 resigned as @entity31 medical advisor due to its introduction of a five - minute concussion bin although bloodied and clearly unsteady on his feet when being taken off following a scary collision between his head and a @entity14 player ’s knee , @entity11 was patched up and eventually sent back into the fray at the behest of his coach @entity41 , who was shown by the television cameras at the door of the medical room pressurising his staff and player to get a move on			1
@entity11 played six more minutes before common sense finally prevailed			1
he would not return for the second half			0
‘ it was horrific , ’ says @entity2 , adding that sort of impact to the head can cause damage to the brain			1
‘ that is the sort of thing the @entity31 , even with their protocol , are not going to be able to control if it is a vital game			1
’ the medical expert insists power of tv and the huge influence of the commercial side of the game focuses on the glory for a club and not player welfare			2
it ’s not the only development this month that has concerned @entity2 , though			0
it ’s nearly two years now since he resigned as a leading @entity31 medical advisor due to its introduction of the controversial five - minute concussion bin			1
that trial had its notable malfunctions , most infamously the sorry sight of the @entity79 sending @entity80 back into battle against the @entity82 last july when he was in no fit state to do so following a head collision with @entity85			2
@entity2 ’s phone suffered a meltdown the other week after the @entity11 incident in the @entity12 versus @entity14 match			1
head injury : @entity12 centre @entity11 returned to the field of play however , @entity2 was left gobsmacked the other week when the @entity31 hailed its experiment a success in forcing a drop in the number of concussed players returning to the field of play			1
but more depressingly for the former @entity102 international , he learnt that the pitchside concussion assessment [ @entity104 ] will now double in duration from five to 10 minutes to accommodate altered balance and memory tests			2
@entity2 still vehemently insists — as he has always done — that the policy should be zero tolerance			0
that if a player is recognised as showing concussion symptoms he is taken off and that ’s it			2
no second chance because a five - minute or the soon - to - be 10 - minute check is , in his belief , simply not sufficient when dealing with the grey matter of a brain injury			1
‘ there needs to be zero tolerance on this , not varying degrees if you show signs you are concussed			0
pure and simple , ’ he insisted			0
‘ doing a five - minute or a 10 - minute assessment , it becomes completely arbitrary			1
the @entity31 have confused and trivialised concussion			1
‘ the experts still do n’t know exactly the full significance of concussion but every bit of research that is coming out is really bad news			2
‘ there can be no messing about with the brain			0
discussion : @entity141 was concussed during the match with @entity143 and spoke to dr @entity144 after the half - time whistle family affair : @entity148 , right , celebrates with his son , @entity149 after @entity152 's @entity151 victory ‘ it ’s frightening how little we do know about the brain , but there has been no bit of good news at all about the short or long - term effects of concussion			1
‘ to say rugby has got a couple of tests on the touchline , that we will get you to stand up straight for a few minutes and clear you , that ’s just the wrong way to go about it			0
‘ it just really frustrates me			0
people are playing their own agenda on this , whether it is a club agenda or a player agenda or a doctor agenda , and that is because the @entity31 has given them the opportunity … and now they have given them another layer			1
‘ they had got five minutes and now they are getting 10 minutes			0
they have got potential concussion , they have got suspected concussion , four or five different levels and they can get away with it [ clearing a player to return to play ]			2
‘ the whole thing is arbitrary now for all different reasons			0
different coaches , different clubs making different decisions on the same situations			0
that has only got one end point , zero tolerance			0
’ @entity2 continues to have no regrets about quitting and going public with his concerns over the @entity104 trial			0
in the high - powered world of “ mercs and perks ” sports administration , it ’s rare for someone to go cold turkey but @entity2 was driven by his conscience and will continue to do so despite becoming a persona non grata in the eyes of his former colleagues			2
taking a hit : @entity29 is tackled by @entity143 's @entity207 making ground : @entity29 was part of the @entity82 squad that beat @entity79 in the recent @entity212 series @entity213 ‘ i miss very much a lot of the people there and a lot of the work i was doing there , just discipline and medicine , but i can sleep at night			1
’ he ’ll sleep even more soundly after this weekend knowing his nephew — @entity224 ’s @entity223 — will have finally hung up the boots and wo n’t be exposed to any more potential concussions			0
‘ i ’m glad @entity149 is finishing			0
for all sorts of reasons he has been an incredible player , one of the best players the world has ever seen			0
he has carried himself as an example to everybody but he has taken a lot of knocks and i ’m just glad he is finishing his tremendous career now			0
there ’s nothing left for him to achieve			0
