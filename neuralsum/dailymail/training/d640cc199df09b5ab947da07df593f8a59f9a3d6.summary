by @entity0 last updated at 1:53 am on 27th august 2011 @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 has stepped down after barely 15 months in office			1
@entity1 's announcement comes after his approval ratings plunged over his handling of the country 's nuclear crisis that followed the earthquake off @entity2 in march			1
in a nationally televised speech , @entity1 said he was stepping down as chief of the ruling @entity12			2
stepping down : @entity2 prime minister @entity1 bows during a press conference at his official residence in @entity16 he said he will officially quit as prime minister after the ruling party votes to pick a new leader on monday			1
the winner will become the country 's sixth prime minister in five years			1
@entity2 has been plagued by high turnover in political leadership at a time when the country faces huge problems			1
the country is suffering from an aging population , bulging debt and a stagnant economy - and now reconstruction from the worst disaster to hit the country since @entity35			1
finance minister @entity36 and trade minister @entity37 are also seen as contenders			2
the decision was widely expected because in june , @entity1 had promised to quit once lawmakers passed three key pieces of legislation , the final two of which cleared the parliament earlier today			0
@entity1 managed to survive only a few months longer than the four previous prime ministers , who each lasted a year or less			0
addressing the nation : prime minister @entity1 faced widespread criticism before announcing he will step down looking back on his year and three months in office , @entity1 said he did all he could given difficulties he faced , including the disasters and a major election defeat in upper house elections last summer that left the parliament in gridlock			0
' under the severe circumstances , i feel i 've done everything that i had to do , ' he said			0
' now i would like to see you choose someone respectable as a new prime minister			0
' the 64 - year - old @entity1 has seen his approval ratings tumble below 20 per cent amid a perceived lack of leadership after the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , which led to meltdowns at three reactors at the @entity71 nuclear power plant			2
only 10 per cent of respondents approved of @entity1 's job performance , while 69 percent disapproved , in an @entity76 - @entity75 poll conducted between july 29 and august 10			1
some 21 per cent said they neither approved or disapproved			2
the poll 's margin of error was 3.8 per cent			1
survivors have complained about slow recovery efforts , and radiation has spread into the air , water and some foods			0
devastated : @entity2 's @entity71 power plant has so far emitted radiation equal to 168 @entity90 bombs radiation leaking from the plant has declined dramatically as workers try to bring the plant to a cold shutdown by january			1
many of the 100,000 people who were evacuated from around the plant live in temporary housing or shelter , and have no idea when they will be able to return to their homes			0
accumulated radiation in some locations may keep them away for a long time , government officials have said recently			0
political commentators say @entity1 was at least partly undone by persistent political infighting , including within his own party			0
while the public hungered for political cooperation and vision in the wake of the crisis , parliamentary sessions frequently descended into squabbling matches that have disillusioned the public			2
it was a no - confidence motion in june submitted by an opposition bloc that prompted @entity1 in june to promise he would resign in a desperate attempt to keep his own party members from joining the vote			0
in the wake of the crisis , @entity1 urged @entity2 to become less reliant on nuclear energy , but his appeal did little to boost his image			1
at an evening press conference , @entity1 said that the atomic crisis made him realize that having so many nuclear power plants in quake - prone @entity2 ' could endanger the people 's future '			1
contenders will officially declare their candidacy on saturday , followed by a debate on sunday and party vote on monday			0
the new cabinet is expected to be installed on tuesday			0
@entity2 will remove soil , plants , trees and cleaning roofs of buildings in an area spanning thousands of square miles in a bid to halve radiation in places contaminated by the @entity71 nuclear crisis			1
the cleanup could cost tens of billions of dollars , and thousands of evacuees may not be able to return home for years , if ever			2
radiation in a contaminated area is estimated to fall naturally by about 40 per cent over two years , and the government wants to speed up the process by another 10 per cent through human efforts			1
yesterday it was revealed the amount of radioactive caesium - 137 released by the plant so far is estimated to be equal to that of 168 @entity90 bombs			0
@entity163 nuclear experts , however , said the @entity35 bomb blast and the accidental reactor meltdowns at @entity71 , which has seen ongoing radiation leaks but no deaths so far , were beyond comparison			0
today , nuclear crisis minister @entity169 said : ' we aim to reduce radiation levels by half over the next two years in affected areas , and by 60 per cent over the same period for places used by children			1
' @entity1 urged the @entity177 to seek unity as they pick a new leader			2
a key player in the process remains party kingpin @entity182 , who still wields enormous influence even though he lost to @entity184 in the party leadership election last september			0
' i hope to see this party become one , where everyone from the young to the veterans can discuss policy actively and freely , then cooperate and act as one , ' @entity1 said			0
@entity1 , who called off a planned trip to visit president @entity194 next month due to the political uncertainty , said @entity16 should keep @entity2 - @entity197 alliance as a ' cornerstone ' of its security and foreign policy			2
he also urged his successor to ' not put off any longer ' attempts to rein in @entity2 's public debt , which has grown to more than twice the size of the country 's gross domestic product			1
the idea of raising the country 's five per cent sales tax as a way to address this problem and raise money for reconstruction efforts seems to have lost traction .			1

polls show 69 per cent wanted him to go
@entity2 seeks sixth leader in five years
