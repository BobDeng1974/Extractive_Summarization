@entity0 is expected to announce the new policy for schools if the @entity3 stay in power today thousands of coasting state schools will be forced to become academies in an ‘ all - out war on mediocrity ’ if the @entity3 remain in power , @entity0 will say today			1
up to 3,500 primary and secondary schools judged to require improvement by watchdogs will be at risk of being taken over by new headteachers , backed by other successful academies or expert sponsors			1
@entity18 sources said the policy represented a ‘ turbo - charging ’ of the existing academies programme started by @entity22			2
currently only schools judged ‘ inadequate ’ can be converted against their will , while outstanding secondaries and primaries can apply for academy status , which affords them key freedoms from state control			1
the move suggests the @entity32 now envisage that all schools will ultimately become academies , free from local authority control			2
it also appears to be an attempt to drive another wedge between @entity39 and senior @entity40 in his party , who have long despaired of how he has ceded ownership of the academies programme to the @entity45			2
the @entity32 election push on schools policy comes after education secretary @entity48 indicated the party would protect her budget from austerity measures for another five years			1
the @entity32 also plan to raise standards by making all schoolchildren in @entity55 learn their times tables by heart as well as carry out long division and complex multiplication by the age of 11			0
they will also have to be able to read a novel and write a short story			0
many schools already expect pupils to meet these targets , but all will be expected to pass tough tests before leaving primary school as part of a ‘ war on illiteracy and innumeracy ’			1
mr @entity0 will say today : ‘ as parents we ’re hardwired to want the best for our kids			2
no one wants their child to go to a failing school – and no one wants to them to go to a coasting school either			0
so this party is clear			2
“ just enough ” is not good enough			0
that means no more sink schools – and no more “ bog standard ” schools either			0
‘ we ’re waging an all - out war on mediocrity , and our aim is this : the best start in life for every child , wherever they ’re from – no excuses			0
’ @entity22 allowed failing state schools to be converted into academies and taken over with new leadership , with impressive results			1
the @entity45 extended the policy by allowing the most successful schools to apply for academy status , which gives them freedom over their budgets , the national curriculum , term dates and staff pay			1
around half of all secondaries and one in ten primaries is now an academy			0
under a @entity3 government , any school judged as ‘ requires improvement ’ would automatically be considered to become an academy			1
@entity48 indicated the conservatives would protect her budget for schools in the next five years			1
labour education spokesman @entity122 however said the policy was ' damaging the education system ' only if they can set out a clear plan for rapid improvement , as judged by their @entity129 , would they remain under their existing leadership			1
and any school judged as ‘ requires improvement ’ that is already an academy or a free school may be forced to accept a new sponsor			1
mrs @entity138 said yesterday she believed more rigorous standards would propel @entity55 to the top of the class in @entity143 league tables for @entity55 and maths by 2020 , as well as in the top five internationally – a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd			0
as well as demonstrating mathematical skills , 11 - year - olds will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use ‘ accurate punctuation , spelling and grammar ’			0
headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the @entity3 are returned to power , she indicated			0
‘ i think that ’s what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system , ’ mrs @entity138 told the @entity158 ’s @entity157 programme			0
‘ we have to be ambitious for our young people , if we do n’t get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools			0
’ asked whether the schools budget will be protected , mrs @entity138 said : ‘ we ’re going to have more to say on schools funding very shortly but what i can say is that i am absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected			2
’ @entity22 education spokesman @entity122 said : ‘ @entity0 ’s flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest			1

the prime minister is expected to announce new policy for schools today
thousands of schools judged to require improvement could be taken over
*previously* only ' inadequate ' schools can be converted against their will
comes as @entity48 says the party will ' protect ' education budget
