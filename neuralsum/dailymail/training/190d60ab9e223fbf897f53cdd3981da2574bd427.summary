by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 06:41 est , 3 august 2013 reassurance : immigration minister @entity2 has insisted spot checks at train stations are not based on people 's ethnicity people being stopped at railway station for spot checks by immigration officers are not targeted on the basis of their race , the immigration minister has insisted			1
but @entity2 admitted that the reason he could not reveal how many people of different ethnicities are stopped was because it is not recorded			1
officials are instructed to only take down names , dates of birth and nationalities of people they stop			1
the minister said spot checks in @entity25 stations were carried out on the basis of individuals ' behaviour , not their appearance or skin colour			1
checks at two tube stations have led to 17 arrests on suspicion of immigration offences			2
no figures have been published as to how many people in total were stopped			1
the @entity38 has launched an investigation into the immigration checks for possible discrimination , and is also probing a controversial @entity43 advertising campaign , which saw vans deployed in parts of @entity25 with the message to illegal immigrants that they should ' go home ' or face arrest			2
speaking on @entity51 's today programme , mr @entity2 said : ' we are not carrying out random checks of people in the street and asking people to show their papers			1
that 's absolutely not what we are doing			2
we would n't have the lawful authority to do that			0
the operations carried out at two tube stations were based on specific intelligence about concerns that we had about those particular locations and about the times when we conducted the operations			2
we were n't stopping people based on their race or their ethnicity			1
we were only stopping people and questioning them where we had a reasonable suspicion that they were an immigration offender			2
' these operations have been carried out for many years , and indeed also were carried out under the last government as well			0
' explaining how officers choose individuals for questioning , mr @entity2 said : there 's two things that we use			1
the first thing is intelligence about the location and the time that we are carrying out the operation			0
that 's not the only thing you need to stop somebody and question them			2
you also need , about that individual , a reasonable suspicion that they are an immigration offender			0
controversial : the @entity97 is looking into the @entity43 's ' go home ' vans , which are being driven around @entity25 ' they are not allowed to do it based on someone 's physical appearance			1
if , someone , when seeing an immigration officer , behaved in a very suspicious way , that might give us reasonable suspicion to question them			0
' it 's about how they behave , not what they look like			0
it 's not about their appearance or their race or their ethnicity			1
' mr @entity2 said it was made clear to those stopped that they do not have to answer questions if they do not wish to			1
' if we do n't have sufficient grounds to arrest somebody , then we are n't able to do so , ' he said			0
' the questioning we carry out is a consensual one and the person does n't have to be questioned at all , and that should be made clear to them when they are questioned			0
' data on the numbers stopped for questioning will be released ' in due course ' , said mr @entity2			1
@entity137 immigration spokesman @entity136 has written to home secretary @entity138 demanding details of how many people were stopped for questioning and what proportion led to the detection of suspected offences			1
he told today : ' i would like her to give us exact details of how many people have been arrested , how many people have been stopped , what ethnicity they were			1
if it feels as if what is basically happening is that they are going to some parts of the country and stopping every person with a black face , then that is totally unacceptable			0
' high profile : the @entity43 tweeted images of arrests during a crackdown on illegal immigrants on thursday arrests : a suspect illegal immigrant is caught by @entity166 officials in a raid at a nail bar in @entity169 on friday the @entity43 's own guidance says that an immigration officer can only stop somebody if they have intelligence to say that that person may be an illegal immigrant , said mr @entity136			0
' what we really need from @entity138 - and i think this is a matter of urgency now , because we have had a sort of moral panic that 's been created by all of this over the last 10 days and i have a hateful fear that this is what the general election is going to be like - is precise numbers of where these stops and searches were being done , what the percentage was of people who were arrested , ' he said			2
' they need to have a better intelligence - led operation			0
what we have seen since 2010 is that the number of illegal immigrants removed from the country has fallen , the number of people stopped at our borders has fallen , and the number of foreign criminals deported has fallen			2
i think we could get that end of the equation right first			0
' more than 130 suspected illegal immigrants were arrested on thursday in a crackdown on rogue employers that was highly publicised by the @entity43 through the department 's website and micro-blogging site @entity214			0
an @entity38 spokesman said yesterday : ' the commission is writing to the @entity43 about these reported operations , confirming that it will be examining the powers used and the justification for them , in order to assess whether unlawful discrimination took place			0
' the letter will also ask questions about the extent to which the @entity43 complied with its public sector equality duty when planning the recent advertising campaign targeted at illegal migration			0

@entity2 insisted checks are based on people 's behaviour , not race
but he could not say how many people of different ethnicities are stopped
officers only record names , dates of birth and nationalities in spot checks
