@entity0 , who was cleared by a court but is still separated from her daughter when @entity3 mother @entity0 took her seriously ill daughter to a world - renowned doctor in @entity7 in the hope of finding a cure , she could never have imagined the extraordinary events that were to follow			1
when she returned to the @entity3 , ms @entity0 , an expert in the field of special educational needs , was astounded to find herself imprisoned and prosecuted – accused of trying to poison her daughter			1
then , to her horror , the child was taken from her and was subsequently placed in psychiatric care			2
now ms @entity0 is free again , following the collapse of the case against her at @entity19 last week , and is relieved to have her name cleared			1
but , speaking for the first time about her ordeal , the 55 - year - old says she is furious that charges were brought in the first place , and devastated she has yet to be reunited with her 16 - year - old daughter			1
in particular she blames the @entity27 for operating rigid rules about treatment that allowed the prosecution to take place – but also her former husband , @entity32 , who she believes needlessly reported her to the police			0
‘ it ’s unbelievable what i ’ve been through , ’ she says of a case that has echoes of @entity36 , whose parents fled abroad to seek proton treatment for his cancer and ended up in prison in @entity41			2
‘ i am very angry and fed up as i was completely misrepresented prior to my acquittal			0
‘ i am just so relieved			0
this case came about because i am a caring mother and was only acting in my daughter ’s interest			1
i ’m now looking forward to being reunited with her			0
‘ all of the allegations against me were wrong			0
i know my ex-husband was behind it all			0
i ’m in no doubt			0
he was very upset about our divorce , which he did n’t want , and unhappy that the children went with me			0
the prosecuting team were very careful to keep him out of it during the court hearing			0
‘ i have been through a huge ordeal			0
as things become clear i will make decisions about whether i am going to sue anyone			0
‘ i tried to make the best of it in prison , and i was treated well , but my life will never be the same again			0
‘ i hope i will become a stronger person as a result of what i ’ve been put through			0
‘ when i was told i was free this week , well , it ’s indescribable what i felt			2
i was elated , relieved , and very , very thankful that justice has at last been done			0
’ the @entity75 hospital where dr @entity76 diagnosed the girl with hormone deficiency , and prescribed medication ms @entity0 ’s barrister , @entity80 , says that her complaints against her husband were part of her evidence , but were never heard in court as the case against her collapsed			1
during the court case ms @entity0 , from @entity87 in @entity88 , was accused of dosing her daughter with unnecessary medicines and of ‘ doctor shopping ’			1
this , it was alleged , involved touring hospitals and clinics in @entity3 and then abroad , until she received a diagnosis for her daughter – hormone deficiency – that she found acceptable , but which the @entity27 did not recognise			1
in 2012 , desperate for help , she travelled with her daughter , who can not be named for legal reasons , to the @entity75 clinic of dr @entity76 , a @entity7 physician and expert in hormone therapy			1
she believes that , as a result of the deficiency , the girl was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome that had left her virtually bed - ridden			2
the prosecution claimed that once under dr @entity76 ’s supervision , ms @entity0 administered toxic levels of three hormones in a five - month period			1
@entity7 doctor @entity76 , left , who says that the @entity27 system needs to reform			1
the prosecution claimed the girl was given ' toxic ' levels of medicines including hydrocortisone , right but according to the @entity7 doctor , the girl ’s ailments improved			1
taking up the story , ms @entity0 ’s sister , @entity125 , says : ‘ @entity0 thought that dr @entity76 was absolutely fantastic			1
‘ he measured my niece ’s thyroid , oestrogen , growth hormone and cortisol and found her to be deficient in all of these , so he prescribed medication to correct the deficiencies			2
’ but , it seems , when ms @entity0 ’s ex-husband found out about the treatment , he contacted police , two months later			1
in march 2013 , police arrived at ms @entity0 ’s home with social services and arrested her			1
ms @entity125 continues : ‘ i took a phone call at work from @entity0 who said simply , “ i ’ve been arrested			1
” ‘ at first i thought it was some sort of joke			0
there was silence down the line			0
for child cruelty ” , @entity0 said			1
’ after 24 hours in custody , ms @entity0 was released on bail			1
the prosecution claimed that once under dr @entity76 ’s supervision , ms @entity0 administered toxic levels of three hormones in a five - month period ms @entity125 adds : ‘ the judge also ordered that my niece go back to school			1
she had been home - educated from age ten			2
suddenly facing a return to school , without her mother around to support her , was too much for her			0
’ the judge also ordered her to live with her father , and she ran away twice			0
one afternoon early this year , she locked herself in her father ’s bathroom and in a highly emotional state she sent a text to her mother			0
@entity0 , who was worried her daughter was going to harm herself , texted back , which breached her bail			1
@entity32 phoned the police and @entity0 was arrested again and taken into custody , and then to @entity178 prison near @entity179			1
‘ her ex-husband told police and social services that @entity0 would try to take their daughter out of the country , and we think this is why they have acted as they have , ’ says ms @entity125			1
‘ @entity0 is a responsible person and she would never , ever have done that			2
’ ms @entity0 has been apart from her daughter since march 2013			1
in january this year she was charged under the @entity190 with poisoning her daughter with thyroid extract , oestrogen and hydrocortisone			2
she was then allowed only two hours supervised contact each fortnight			0
her daughter became so distressed that she suffered a breakdown after the pair were separated , and was detained in hospital under the @entity199			2
‘ my daughter is on other medicine now but she does appear to be fit and well , which is great , ’ ms @entity0 says			1
‘ she is on the verge of discharge but i still do n’t know when i can see her			0
‘ i ’m very angry with the way the @entity208 , social services and the police all dealt with this			0
they formed an opinion of me without even meeting me			0
‘ the whole case raises the question of a parent ’s right to find treatment outside the @entity27 for their child			2
adults have total freedom to go wherever we want in the world for our health care but if you ’re a child it seems only the @entity27 can treat you			2
’ supporting ms @entity0 , dr @entity76 says that her trial ‘ should never have taken place ’ and called for widespread @entity27 reform to allow parents greater choice over their child ’s care			2
‘ two lives have been broken , ’ he says			0
‘ the whole system needs reform			0
we have to give people the right to choose their doctor without fear of prosecution			2

@entity0 took seriously ill daughter to a world - renowned @entity7 doctor
when she returned to the @entity3 , she found herself imprisoned and prosecuted
last week the case against her at @entity19 collapsed
for the first time she has now spoke of her fury that charges were brought against her
