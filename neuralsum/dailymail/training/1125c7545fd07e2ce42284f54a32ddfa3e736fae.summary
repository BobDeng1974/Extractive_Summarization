by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 5 august 2013 mothers who breastfeed have a two - thirds lower risk of developing @entity4 ’s in later life , compared with women who never breastfeed their children , according to a study			1
the longer the duration of breastfeeding , the more protection is gained by the mother , say researchers at @entity14			1
they interviewed 81 @entity16 mothers aged between 70 and 100 , who included women with and without @entity4 ’s			1
the team also spoke to relatives , spouses and carers			0
@entity14 researchers found women who breastfed had a 64 per cent reduced @entity4 risk compared with women who did not			1
longer breastfeeding cut the risk still further through these interviews , the researchers collected information about the women ’s reproductive history , their breastfeeding history and their dementia status			1
all of this information was then compared with the participants ’ breastfeeding history			0
despite the small number of participants , the study revealed a number of clear links between breastfeeding and @entity4 ’s			2
these were not affected when the researchers took into account potential variables such as age , education history , the age when the woman first gave birth , her age at menopause , and smoking and drinking history , says a report in the @entity55			0
the researchers found women who breastfed had a 64 per cent reduced @entity4 ’s risk compared with women who did @entity60 breastfeeding cut the risk further			1
the study found women who breastfed for a year had 78 per cent of the risk of @entity4 ’s of a woman who breastfed for four months			1
one theory is that breastfeeding restores hormone levels , including insulin tolerance which dips during pregnancy , which may make the brain more vulnerable to @entity4 's and doing more breastfeeding offset the higher risk of @entity4 ’s linked to more months of pregnancy			1
however , the protective benefits were far less for women who had a parent or sibling with dementia			2
one theory is breastfeeding deprives the body of the hormone progesterone , which is known to desensitise the brain ’s oestrogen receptors , making it more difficult for oestrogen to protect the brain against @entity4 ’s			2
another possibility is that breastfeeding increases a woman ’s glucose tolerance by restoring her insulin sensitivity after pregnancy			0
dr @entity92 , of the @entity93 at the @entity14 , who led the study , said : ‘ @entity4 is the world ’s most common cognitive disorder and it already affects 35.6million people			2
‘ in the future , we expect it to spread most in low and middle - income countries			0
so it is vital that we develop low - cost , large - scale strategies to protect people against this devastating disease			0
’ ' the worrying thing is that this older generation spent more time breastfeeding - only one per cent of mothers in @entity16 today breastfeed exclusively for six months , ' said dr @entity111 of @entity112 she said the study was not able to compare the @entity4 ’s risk in mothers , whether they breastfed or not , and women who remained childless			1
but previous research suggested not having children might be linked with poorer cognitive function in old age , she added			0
dr @entity92 went on : ‘ the worrying thing is that this older generation spent more time breastfeeding			0
only one per cent of mothers in @entity16 today breastfeed exclusively for six months			0
’ dr @entity111 , the head of research at @entity112 , said ‘ preliminary studies like this one are important for highlighting associations worthy of further study , but we should n’t be quick to jump to conclusions quite yet			0

a @entity14 study of 81 @entity16 women has found a ' highly significant link ' between breastfeeding and dementia
it suggests breastfeeding restores hormone levels and protects the brain
longer breastfeeding is thought to cut the risk still further
