by @entity0 a close friend of the @entity2 has been banned from the road for a third time after being found guilty of drink - driving in his £ 90,000 sports car following a visit to one of his exclusive @entity11 nightclubs			1
@entity13 was barred from driving for two and a half years and ordered to pay £ 7,120 in costs and fines			1
@entity11 's @entity16 heard that it was the second time @entity13 has been banned for drink - driving			1
they are pictured above at his wedding in @entity28 , earlier this year @entity13 is close friends with both @entity30 and prince @entity26 and even organised the @entity2 's stag do ahead of the @entity32 in 2011			0
they both attended his ' wild ' wedding in @entity28 , earlier this year , which was preceded by a three - day - long party			0
@entity37 's high - class lifestyle has led him into trouble with the law before			0
it 2001 , whuile a student at agricultural college , he was hit with a two - year driving ban for drink - driving			1
he was also banned for a further 56 days and given a £ 750 for a speeding offence in 2012			1
though it was widely reported that he supplied prince @entity26 in 2001 with cannabis when the @entity47 was 16 , no police action was taken			0
in 2001 he had his licence confiscated for two years after he was pulled over for drink - driving while travelling home to ' student digs ' after partying during freshers ' week at agricultural college			1
he was breathalysed and found to have a reading ' in the 90s ' of microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - nearly three times the legal limit of 35			2
@entity13 was previously banned from driving for 56 days and fined £ 750 for speeding in 2012			1
district judge @entity59 said : ' you have that previous like conviction			0
i accept that it is now 13 years ago but that was a serious offence			0
' i really highlight the period of disqualification for you , then a younger man of good character , and the court then disqualified you for two years			0
' sadly that did not deter you from , years later , when you were stopped in 2013			0
' he added : ' what you need to bear in mind is that anybody driving a motor vehicle is in possession of a potentially lethal weapon			0
and when you drive with excess alcohol , or any alcohol , your thought process can be affected			0
' @entity13 was sentenced today after he was pulled over while at the wheel of his @entity85 @entity84 in @entity11 's @entity86 in the early hours of may 28 last year			1
the 32 - year - old initially refused to give a roadside breath test before being taken to @entity90 police station to give a sample on an intoximeter machine			1
the aristocrat , who recently married @entity95 heiress @entity94 at a ceremony attended by @entity24 and @entity26 , was found to have 52 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath			0
royal favourite : @entity13 is pictured here with princess @entity101 inside @entity102 during his trial , defence lawyer @entity103 called experts who claimed that radiowaves from @entity13 's @entity107 had interfered with the machine			1
mr @entity103 , who has represented a string of celebrities facing driving offences including football pundit @entity112 , said police radios may also have affected the intoximeter , making the reading unsafe			0
but today district judge @entity59 ruled that he was entirely satisfied that @entity13 was guilty of drink - driving and that the intoximeter machine was working			1
@entity13 , wearing a smart grey suit , white shirt and blue and white polka dot tie , looked relaxed but blushed as he handed his driving licence to the court clerk			2
during his trial , @entity13 , from @entity123 in central @entity11 , claimed he had drunk two large glasses of red wine with dinner hours before he was stopped and arrested			1
@entity127 : @entity13 with prince @entity26 's ex-girlfriend @entity128 at the launch of @entity102 @entity130 : @entity102 , pictured , is a @entity132 - themed club in @entity133 , central @entity11 but the court heard he told police at the time that he had drunk two beers the day he was pulled over			1
@entity13 said he stopped drinking at around 11pm , climbed into his car and drove to @entity102 , the @entity133 nightclub he runs , where he spoke to staff and customers before driving off at around 1am			2
he was pulled over just before 1.10am by police who claimed he had accelerated quickly in the luxury car			2
but @entity13 - who smelt of alcohol , according to officers - refused to give a breath test			1
he told the court he ' was anxious because i thought that i had drunk near to the limit '			0
professor @entity150 , an expert witness for the defence , argued that the police station intoximeter which showed @entity13 was over the limit could have been faulty			1
he claimed there was an unusual pause of 125 seconds between the machine recording a baseline reading of zero and it being activated and ready to use			0
and a software expert told the court that signals from the radios worn by officers in the custody area may have interfered with @entity13 's breathalyser reading			2
throwback : @entity13 is pictured above in 2005 with prince @entity24 leaving @entity165 , in @entity166 , after a night out old times : prince @entity24 , left and @entity13 , right , watch a @entity169 rugby match together in 2002 dr @entity170 said radio waves from @entity13 's @entity107 may have also corrupted the reading			1
but judge @entity59 said there was no evidence that the machine had malfunctioned and @entity13 's claims that he did not drink at his bar on the night in question were not credible			2
he said it was ' curious ' that @entity13 described the wine he drank as ' house red ' - a description usually used in pubs and bars			2
the judge added : ' notwithstanding exhaustive expert evidence and lengthy submissions made on his behalf , i am entirely satisfied mr @entity13 has not produced any evidence that raises the realistic possibility that the evidential breath machine in operation at @entity90 police station malfunctioned and produced inaccurate or unreliable readings			1
' i am able to state that i am entirely satisfied that mr @entity13 has either deliberately chosen to underplay the amount of alcohol that he consumed in the period of time leading up to his arrest in the early hours of 20 may 2013 , or his memory has genuinely failed him			2
' and he said he was ' entirely satisfied the offence with which mr @entity13 stands charged has been amply proved beyond any reasonable doubt and that he is guilty of the offence of driving with excess alcohol '			2
@entity205 , defending , said @entity13 's past drink - driving conviction was a ' stern and stiff ' sentence while he was young and naive			1
she said : ' it is reminiscent of a time when mr @entity13 was attending agricultural college , it was freshers ' week , he was driving with a friend , they were going from a bar back to his student digs			2
' it was in the ' 90s , a very high reading at a time when he was younger and foolish			0
it was a stern and stiff sentence reflecting the high alcohol in the reading , it was probably to teach men like this a lesson			0
' @entity13 , who ran celebrity nightspots @entity226 and @entity227 in the past , has been in the @entity229 ' inner circle for years			0
his grandmother , @entity230 , was a member of the @entity232 sugar dynasty			0
he told the court he would pay his £ 7,120 in fines and costs immediately by card			1
this included a £ 2,000 fine , prosecution costs of £ 5,000 and a £ 120 victim surcharge			0
he declined to comment as he left the courtroom today .			0

@entity13 was pulled over in his @entity20 @entity243 last may
