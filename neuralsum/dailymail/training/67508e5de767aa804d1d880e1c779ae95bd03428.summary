by @entity0 for @entity1 this shows the split second before the nine - year - old girl shoots @entity5 in the head			1
she appears to have lost her double handed grip on the @entity8 as it recoils after firing just hours after a nine - year girl accidentally shot and killed her gun instructor , the @entity9 tweeted ‘ 7 ways children can have fun at the shooting range ’			1
the ' ill - timed ' tweet posted by @entity16 , which linked to an article on women ’s @entity19 , was deleted without an apology or explanation			1
it has been criticised as ‘ tasteless ’ , as the article was shared less than two days after a young girl in @entity25 lost control of a sub-machine gun , striking 39 - year - old @entity5			1
a shocking recording from the @entity29 and burgers shooting range in @entity31 , @entity25 , shows the moment the nine - year - old girl shot mr @entity5 with an @entity8 on monday			1
the video , taken by the girl 's parents and released by police , shows mr @entity5 standing closely next to the girl when the gun recoiled as she fired on full automatic mode			2
his last words to the girl are : ' alright , full auto. ' the nation 's largest gun lobby has now come under fire for posting a ‘ tasteless ’ tweet on wednesday , so soon after this accident			1
in the article , parents are encouraged to introduce different types of targets to engage young shooters who have grown bored with the standard bull 's - eye			2
mutants and zombie targets are among those suggested , with author @entity57 saying : ‘ we ’re not sure if they will frighten young children , or if they can imagine they ’re getting rid of the monsters from their nightmares			2
regardless , they do look like lots of fun			2
’ the article itself is dated august 20 , five days before the tragic @entity25 shooting , which occurred at a popular shooting range near @entity68			1
people have taken to social media to criticise the @entity9 's ill - timed tweet			1

@entity91 said : ' these are not enough words to describe how insensitive this is			0
' @entity95 tweeted : ' this is incredibly tasteless			0
could there be worse timing ? ' in the video of the accident , mr @entity5 is seen instructing the girl to hold the weapon with two hands at all times and to take a perpendicular stance to the target			2
then mr @entity5 asks her to fire one shot for him , which she does			2
he then tells the girl to adjust her stance and squeeze the trigger to let off a volley , but something goes wrong when she fires a second time			0
the girl loses her two - handed grip on the weapon and it pulls to her left , striking mr @entity5 in the head			2
@entity5 , a staff sergeant , passed away on monday night after helping a nine - year - old at a shooting range the @entity122 - made submachine gun can fire almost 30 rounds per second , according to the manufacturer			1
mr @entity125 from @entity76 , @entity25 , was airlifted to hospital on monday morning after the little girl shot him but died that evening			1
@entity129 sheriff @entity128 said the full video of the incident was ' ghastly '			0
he said that the girl had successfully fired the weapon several times before when it was set on ' single shot ' mode			0
however , the horrific accident unfolded in a split second when the @entity122 made weapon was set to ' full - automatic mode ' and caused mr @entity5 his fatal injuries			1
' the guy just dropped , ' mr @entity128 said of the former soldier , who suffered more than one gunshot to the head			0
mr @entity128 told the @entity145 that no charges will be filed because @entity29 and burgers is licensed and legal as an operation			0
the nine - year - old girl , who has not been identified , was not injured			1
she was with her parents as they passed through the area on vacation from @entity153			0
the range operator at @entity29 and @entity147 told @entity155 he was shocked by the incident			0
' we really do n't know what happened			0
our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they 're shooting			0
if they 're shooting right - handed , we have our right - hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way			0
and if they 're left - handed , the same thing , ' operator @entity165 said			0
