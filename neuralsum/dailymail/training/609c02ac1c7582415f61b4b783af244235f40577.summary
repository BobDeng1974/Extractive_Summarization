@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest instalment of his column for @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on how much of a ' proper bloke ' he thinks @entity12 's @entity11 is and how impressed he was with the atmosphere when his @entity6 side visited @entity16 ' @entity15 last week			1
@entity18 @entity17 how refreshing it was when i visited @entity21 , having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade in a private box , to bump into @entity12 midfielder @entity11			1
he is not short of money , played for endless @entity27 clubs and had just had a good win at @entity29			1
we walked towards each other in a corridor of the stadium , him with his @entity12 tracksuit on , and he said , ' well done at @entity6			1
i see you 're six points clear			0
' @entity38 met @entity12 's tough - tackling @entity11 ( left ) at @entity21 last month @entity0 thought that @entity11 was a ' proper , humble bloke ' after having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade i thought what a proper bloke and a proper man he was			1
the majority of top players earning fortunes are big - time and forget their roots			2
@entity11 is humble , hard - working and a decent person			1
it only seems like yesterday i saw him play for @entity50 reserves at @entity6 's old @entity52 ground on a tuesday night against @entity53			0
i remember he got a yellow card for a crunching tackle on a young @entity53 midfield player			2
@entity11 stood out from the rest of that @entity50 team , not only for his ginger hair but for his tenacious tackling which set him aside from all the nice footballers in the @entity63 side			1
he is a top professional			0
@entity11 stood out from the rest of the @entity50 team when he played for their reserves at @entity6 @entity66 is making moves at spurs i gave @entity69 , who has just been appointed @entity29 's head of recruitment , his first job after his playing career was so cruelly ended			1
@entity74 is old school , from up north , who tells it as it is			0
he was a tough - tackling midfielder and i 'm sure over the next couple of years they will recruit players to put more steel through the spine of @entity29 ' team			1
@entity74 was a player of mine at @entity85			0
he was an old - fashioned central midfield player , a steady up - and - downer			1
but one saturday afternoon , 10 yards in front of me in the dugout , he was involved in a horror tackle and was rushed to hospital			0
@entity69 has been appointed as @entity29 's new head of recruitment that night , i arrived at the hospital and the orthopaedic consultant called me in , pulled the curtain and told me the injury that @entity74 had received was similar to the impact of a car crash			1
his ankle where it met his shin bones was mashed up and he told me there and then that he would n't play again			2
round the corner was his mum and dad and his lovely wife			0
his contract was up at the end of the season and they were yet to hear the news			0
we decided not to tell him and not to tell them and @entity114 , the @entity85 chairman , promised me that we would give @entity74 another year on his contract to help him recover			0
within that time through his rehab and recovery he would start work doing opposition analysis , which turned out to be his pathway forward as he could n't play again			0
@entity0 managed @entity69 at @entity85 before the player suffered a career - ending injury @entity69 ( left ) tackles @entity122 of @entity123 during an @entity125 game for @entity85 in 2006 @entity126 rovers supporters i 've been lucky enough to visit a few @entity27 games over the past six months , but very few can match the atmosphere and passion of @entity16 supporters when we visited the @entity15 on tuesday last week			1
in what was biblical rain , seven - and - a - half thousand turned up and sung their hearts out saluting every tackle , challenge and refereeing decision like it was a @entity141 final , @entity125 final and @entity27 title decider rolled into one			2
after relegation out of the @entity144 on the final day of last season , they could 've turned their backs , but it looks like it 's made them even stronger			0
@entity0 was extremely impressed by the support and atmosphere at @entity16 ' @entity15 @entity153 's analysis player i keep hearing about ... @entity155			1
i 've been watching an attacking - midfield player for three years since i went to see @entity157 against @entity158 to scout them ahead of my @entity160 side meeting them in the @entity125			2
i picked out a boy that night who was skinny but energetic , athletic and enthusiastic for the game			0
he caught my eye back then and recently he played against us for @entity167 and once again attracted my attention			0
he was such a danger in the final third and i put him on my list to get next summer			0
then that crafty @entity173 goes and signs him for @entity174 on loan last week			0
keep an eye out for @entity155			0
@entity155 signed for @entity174 on loan last week and is a player to watch , says @entity0 one thing i 'd change about ... the reputation of lower league football ... people say lower - level football is fading , but i do n't agree			1
we 're still in touch with supporters , it 's more affordable for the general paying public and the old adage that is kick - and - rush is a complete load of b * * * * * *			2
there are good coaches , good managers and the @entity196 is a great league to be involved in			0
@entity0 does not believe lower - level football is fading - he thinks the supporters are still enjoying it the @entity199 having watched @entity29 against @entity12 , many of the @entity29 supporters were saying that @entity202 is not the answer and they need a new manager			1
@entity205 , i thought , he 's taken over and inherited players who lack character and guts			2
the spine of the team is like weak orange squash			0
there 's no tenacity , very little fire , and nothing for the @entity29 supporters to shout about			2
yeah it 's lovely being able to kick the ball with your leg going round the back of your other leg , whatever move they call it , but playing 40 games up and down the country week - in and week - out , tracking full backs , competing man - for - man , and the supporters and owners must be shaking their head at the shocking recruitment			1
it 's no wonder @entity69 has been brought in from @entity53			2
@entity202 has been getting a hard ride at @entity29 but it is not all his fault @entity0 believes @entity202 has inherited a squad who ' lack character and guts ' , like ' weak orange squash '			1

@entity38 was in a private box for @entity29 against @entity12
he met @entity11 , who he thought was a ' proper , humble bloke '
@entity29 ' new head of recruitment @entity69 was given first job by @entity0
he was a tough - tackling midfielder and will find steel for @entity29 ' midfield
the atmosphere at @entity16 ' @entity15 impressed @entity0
