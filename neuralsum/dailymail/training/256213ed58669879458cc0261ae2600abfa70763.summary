by @entity0 published : 19:47 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 01:42 est , 30 may 2013 overstretched hospitals had to close their @entity3 departments to ambulances hundreds of times last year as the crisis in the @entity7 deepens			1
ambulances were turned away and sent to other hospitals no fewer than 357 times in 2012/13 - up almost a quarter on the previous year			1
the alarming figures , uncovered by @entity12 , show that on average over the past year , one casualty department had to close its doors every single day			1
diversions : ambulances were turned away and sent to other hospitals no fewer than 357 times in 2012/13 - up almost a quarter on the previous year concerns : extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received extra delays can increase the risk that patients inside could deteriorate before medical help is received			1
the most recent example was on bank holiday monday , when the @entity29 had to divert patients to @entity31 and @entity32 for periods during both the morning and afternoon			2
even when it reopened , ambulances had to queue and patients faced long delays			1
the figures come amid growing concerns over emergency and out - of - hours care			0
last week the @entity42 revealed that 50 beds a week have closed in @entity7 hospitals since the election - piling extra pressure on @entity3 departments			1
health secretary @entity48 last week blamed gps for the overcrowding in @entity52 ’s casualty wards - saying it was too hard to get an appointment to see them , meaning many have no choice but to turn up at @entity3			1
in addition , more than nine in 10 gps opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours in 2004 despite taking advantage of a huge pay rise as part of a botched contract			2
finger pointing : health secretary @entity48 last week blamed gps for the overcrowding in @entity52 's casualty wards replacement out of hours services proved inadequate in many areas - meaning patients have to go to casualty			2
@entity73 , @entity12 ’s health spokesman , demanded a moratorium on the closure of casualty units across the country in light of the latest alarming figures			0
‘ a&es across the country are in crisis and the pressure shows no sign of abating , ’ he said			0
‘ today we have yet more evidence that the situation has deteriorated significantly on this government ’s watch , with ambulance diverts up by a quarter in the last year			1
‘ this is a crisis of their own making			0
instead of casting round for others to blame , @entity92 and @entity48 need to accept responsibility and develop an urgent plan to relieve the pressure			0
’ @entity12 obtained the figures on @entity3 ‘ diverts ’ from the @entity103			1
these diverts are where a department has to temporarily close because they lack the physical space or staff capacity to deal with any additional patients			1
in 2011/12 there were 287 such occasions when hospitals reached capacity and were unable to cope with new ambulances			0
a year later this had risen by 24 per cent to 357			2
over recent weeks , hospitals in @entity116 have been forced to turn ambulances away			2
they include @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity121 ’s hospitals in east @entity116 , @entity122 and @entity124 hospitals in north @entity116 , and the princess royal and @entity127 hospitals in south @entity116			0
the diversions occurred either when the ambulance was on the journey to hospital or in some cases after they have arrived			1
this wastes time for patients with emergency conditions before they can receive emergency care			2
now @entity137 has been added to the list			0
full : @entity139 in @entity116 is one of several hospitals in the capital to turn ambulances away from its @entity3 in recent weeks no go : @entity146 , pictured , is another that has had to divert emergency patients to another @entity3 @entity149 , president of the @entity150 , the body which represents @entity3 doctors , said : ‘ the emergency department is the point in the system where the pressures of ever increasing demand and finite hospital capacity collide			1
‘ this leads to crowding in emergency departments and ambulance diversions			1
this is frustrating for our patients and difficult for clinicians to provide the prompt high quality care our patients expect and deserve			2
concerns : shadow health secretary @entity73 , pictured , called on health secretary @entity48 to suspend all ongoing @entity3 closure proposals ‘ urgent action is both required and overdue to provide an emergency care system responsive to our patients ’ needs			1
’ @entity12 is today holding an ‘ emergency @entity3 summit ’ to hear directly from staff about the pressures they face on a day - to - day basis			1
mr @entity73 called on health secretary @entity48 to suspend all ongoing @entity3 closure proposals pending a personal review of the latest evdience			1
‘ the facts on the ground are changing fast and call into question the wisdom and safety of closing so many a&es across @entity52 , ’ he said			0
‘ if convincing evidence can be produced to show lives can be saved by closing @entity186 , @entity12 will not oppose them			0
' but , as the pressure builds , the case is changing and the health secretary must err on the side of caution			0
the onus is on him to produce convincing evidence or drop these plans			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity12 will present practical proposals to the health secretary which could help staff at the front line			0
‘ @entity92 and his health secretary have been caught out looking for scapegoats rather than finding solutions			0
they must cut the spin and get a grip without delay			0
’ when a divert is put in place , ambulances are told to take people elsewhere , although life - threatening cases are still accepted at the original hospital			0
official @entity216 guidance say they should only happen in exceptional circumstances			0
‘ diversion of patients as a result of lack of physical or staff capacity to deal with attendances or admissions should be an action of last resort , ’ it says			0
last night a government spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 is currently meeting the 4hr @entity3 waiting time target			1
‘ however , we know that over the past few years @entity3 has been put under increasing pressure because of rising demand			2
' that is why this government is looking at how we address the long term problems facing @entity3 , something the @entity12 failed to do while they were in office			2

the number of ambulance diversions was up almost a quarter last year
on average one @entity3 department had to turn an ambulance away each day
extra delays increase risk that a patients condition can deteriorate
