by @entity0 dengue fever affects more than 390 million people around the world each year and its symptoms can be fatal			1
there is no vaccine for the disease , buy researchers believe they have come up with an alternative to curbing the spread of the disease - in the form of genetically modified mosquitoes			1
and now @entity14 has become the latest country to approve the use of these bugs , which have been engineered in such a way that means their offspring die before reaching maturity			1
@entity14 is the latest country to approve the use of genetically modified mosquitoes , stock image pictured , to curb the spread of dengue fever			1
males have been engineered in such a way that means their offspring die before reaching maturity			1
if the males breed with enough females , the populations will , in theory , be wiped out the @entity36 mosquito was created by @entity38 - based firm @entity37			1
the @entity37 insect can be used to control the dengue mosquito , @entity40 and is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes			2
the @entity37 males , which can not bite , are released to seek out and mate with the wild females			2
their offspring inherit the additional genes and die before becoming functional adults			2
they also inherit a marker that is visible under a special light , making monitoring in the field simple and helping ensure that dengue mosquito control programmes succeed			0
in several trials , successive releases of the @entity37 males have been shown to reduce substantially the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area			2
the idea is that the male insects are on a suicide mission which involves mating with wild females before they , and their offspring , die			2
this , in theory , can reduce the number of wild mosquitoes which carry and spread dengue fever			1
the viral infection causes serious symptoms ranging from high temperatures and muscle pain to bleeding			1
earlier this year , @entity72 announced plans to release the @entity36 insects into its jungles to similarly help tackle the spread			2
the bugs were engineered by @entity38 - based firm @entity37			2
@entity37 has developed the technology to create the genetically modified insects which , it claims , can also be used instead of chemicals to protect food crops from pests			1
the @entity37 insect is used to control the dengue mosquito , @entity40 , because it is a strain of the wild species that contains two additional genes			0

the bugs were engineered by @entity38 - based firm @entity37 in several trials , successive releases of the @entity37 males have been shown to substantially reduce the wild population of dengue mosquitoes in the treated area			1
the firm has held preliminary talks with @entity115 authorities about releasing @entity36 insects into @entity115 fields or greenhouses to reduce pest numbers			0
the @entity36 mosquito trials in @entity72 began in february in @entity121 , in the @entity123 district of @entity72			0
they have been approved by the @entity125 but critics claim no information about the possible downsides have been provided to members of the public			0
there is currently no vaccine for dengue fever so authorities advise the best way to prevent catching the infection is to take precautions when travelling in high - risk areas , such as wearing protective clothing or using a mosquito repellent , stock image pictured , throughout the day and night @entity37 conducted its first experiments of @entity36 mosquitoes in the @entity144 in 2009 and 2010 , followed by a smaller experiment in @entity146 in 2010 and 11			1

both countries have halted further releases			0
larger - scale experiments began in @entity14 in february 2011			0
director of genewatch @entity115 , dr @entity156 , said : ‘ local people should be aware that releasing large numbers of @entity36 mosquitoes can pose risks to their health and the environment			0
' they also need to know who will be liable if anything goes wrong			0
will @entity37 take responsibility for any problems , or just walk away ? ’ @entity166 said changes could be introduced into the wild population which means the dengue fever they spread becomes more dangerous to humans			1
it claims that if the numbers of one type of mosquito - aedes aegypti – is reduced as result of the release of @entity36 versions , others , such as the @entity181 mosquito , which also carry the virus , could come in and thrive .			0

the insects were genetically modified in a *lab* in @entity38
males have been engineered in such a way that means their offspring die before reaching maturity
@entity14 is the latest country to approve the use of these engineered bugs
@entity195 plans to use them to curb the spread of dengue fever
if males breed with enough females , the species could be *eradicated*
@entity204 can cause high temperatures , muscle pains or bleeding
