‘ one of the soldiers made a compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t think it occurred to us that fatalities were going to result			2
‘ but it certainly was slightly odd that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were clearly in distress			1
that caused a little bit of alarm among us			2
‘ but it was a military exercise and you do expect , i suppose , that they are under duress and discomfort			2
’ @entity63 , who was walking with mr @entity7 said they gave water to two soldiers they saw in difficulty , but added that they were not the two who died			1
he said : we have them half a litre into their canteen			2
the said ' thank you ' and that they were going to replenish their stock in a stream			2
' they said they did n't need that much off us because there was a load of military trucks about half an hour along the track			2
' mr @entity7 said one soldier was ‘ upset ’ and asked for water for his colleague rather than himself			1
‘ it must have taken quite a lot for the soldier to ask some civilian hikers for help , ’ added mr @entity7			0
‘ well , we know from our own experience that those streams were no more than a line of arid rocks			0
there was no water to be had from them			1
’ a third soldier is still in a critical condition in hospital , while another three men fell ill during tests to join the elite regiment ’s reserve unit			1
military chiefs have ordered an inquiry into the exercise and how the victims were monitored on one of the @entity22 ’s most unforgiving training areas , in which troops were carrying kit including a 50lb backpack , @entity119 assault rifle and ammunition			1
however , bosses say the routine exercises will continue as normal			0

tough : in the @entity4 ( pictured ) , recruits are expected to march up and down the 2,900ft @entity130			0

one said : ‘ @entity201 loved being in the @entity22 and really wanted to go as far as he could			0

’ the second soldier who died has not been named			2
the victims were among about 100 @entity22 troops starting a week - long period of assessment to join the @entity15 reserves			0
