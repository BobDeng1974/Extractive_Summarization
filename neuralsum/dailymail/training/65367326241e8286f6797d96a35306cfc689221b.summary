by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter fifty years after the assassination of president @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , researchers are still investigating his mysterious murder			1
thousands of pages pertaining to the assassination are still sealed , and researchers are calling for a complete public release			2
@entity13 , former @entity15 reporter currently suing the @entity16 to release the data , is most interested in a file containing about 300 pages on the now - deceased @entity16 agent @entity20			1
who is @entity20 ? researchers believe that files on the @entity16 agent may reveal the suspected @entity26 assassin @entity28 had a connection at @entity16 the first official investigation found that @entity28 was acting alone , after failing to get a visa to @entity40 and his wife @entity41 rejected his attempts at reconciliation			1
another investigation in the mid- 1970s said that the assassination was probably a conspiracy , after discovering audio files suggesting a second shooter			0
these contradicting opinions have led many to come up with conspiracy theories behind the president 's death replacing the initial conclusion that @entity28 acted alone			1
@entity13 does n't believe that the documents will reveal any big conspiracy , but it may prove that the @entity16 did know of @entity28 before the shooting			1
that would contradict the first investigation 's findings that @entity5 's assassination was carried out by a lone - ranger , a completely random act that could n't have been prevented			1
@entity13 believes that @entity28 may have been in contact with @entity20 due to his noted involvement in an @entity68 organization			2
@entity28 's membership in the @entity70 was confirmed when he was captured by a local television station in an altercation with @entity74 demonstrators			0
but investigators later found that @entity28 had pamphlets in his possession with an address of a local @entity74 operation connected to a former @entity81 agent			2
researchers believe those pamphlets mean that @entity28 was working with counterintelligence to discredit his pro-castro group			2
if that 's the case he would have been in contact with @entity20 the @entity16 case officer for the @entity89 - the same group @entity28 got in a brawl with			1
counter intelligence : evidence of @entity28 's connection to the @entity70			0
researchers believe he may have been working from within to undermine the @entity68 group if @entity28 was in contact with @entity20 , it means that the @entity16 concealed the fact that @entity28 was on their radar			1
but @entity20 connection to the assassination does n't end there			2
a second investigation into the assassination convened in the mid- 1970s and this time weighing audio evidence of a possible second shooter			0
in the end the committee reported that the president was ' probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy			0
the committee is unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy			0
' the committee sifted through thousands of @entity16 records , and their liaison to @entity16 at the time was none other than @entity20 , g @entity121 , the committee 's chief counsel , recalled how the @entity16 brought in @entity123 to act as a middleman to help fill requests for documents made by committee researchers			1
@entity128 chief counsel @entity121 , second left , meets with committee chairman @entity129 , left , before a closed session investigating the death of @entity26 ' he was put in a position to edit everything we were given before it was given to us , ' @entity121 said			0
but @entity121 did n't learn about @entity20 ' past until @entity13 unearthed it in files declassified years later			0
@entity20 , middle , being presented with an award in 1981 for 28 years of service , flanked by his wife and @entity143 adm. @entity142 , director of the @entity16 ' if i 'd known @entity20 was the case officer for the @entity145 , he could n't have been liaison ; he would have been a witness , ' @entity121 told @entity0			1
@entity13 does not suggest the @entity20 files point to agency involvement in the assassination itself , but more likely that their release would show the @entity16 trying to keep secret its own flawed performance before the assassination			1
' the idea that @entity28 was some unknown quantity to @entity16 officers was false , ' @entity13 said			2
' there was this incredible high - level attention to @entity28 on the eve of the assassination			0
' assuming that @entity28 fired the fatal shot , he said , ' these top @entity16 case officers are guilty of negligence			2
' @entity121 is n't optimistic about getting all of the documents from the intelligence agency , citing the agencies lack of cooperation with three previous investigations			0
' that 's three agencies that they were supposed to be fully candid with , ' he said			0
' and now they 're taking the position that some of these documents ca n't be released even today			0
' ' why are they continuing to fight tooth and nail to avoid doing something they 'd promised to do ? ' according to the president @entity181 of 1992 , all documents pertaining to the assassination must be released by 2017			1
the act does offer a little wiggle room to agencies who can petition records withheld if disclosure would compromise ' military , defense , intelligence operations , law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations ' .			0

researchers are most interested in the file on @entity20 , a @entity16 agent who may have had a connection to @entity28 and acted as a liaison on a later assassination investigation
all documents pertaining to the @entity5 assassination are set to be released by 2017
