the victim 's family finally contacted authorities after they discovered all the money in the victim 's bank account had gone			1
an expert building surveyor told @entity22 that the work was only worth around £ 24,000 , if all that @entity24 charged for had been completed			1
the surveyor also identified that some invoices showed work had been charged for twice on a number of different occasions			0
evidence showed one of the most outrageous examples was for a shed for which @entity24 charged more than £ 3,500 to build a small two sided outhouse in her garden			0
acting as an expert witness for the prosecution , the surveyor stated : ' in many invoices parts of the building were supposedly opened again and quite often to apparently deal with very slightly different issues , yet i find it impossible to believe that the need for later rectification work was not actually picked up and done at the earlier time			1
this is a recurring theme in the invoices			0
' conman : @entity24 charged the elderly woman £ 3,500 to build this simple garden shed @entity24 , who was jailed for similar offences in 2001 , also carried out gas work for her even though he was not @entity55 registered , which is a legal safety requirement			2

@entity64 , @entity65 for @entity9 and @entity63 , said : ' the level of dishonesty and the appalling abuse of trust involved in this case is truly shocking , so it is excellent news that our @entity73 have successfully worked with @entity9 and @entity75 and the @entity77 team in order to bring mr @entity1 to justice			2
' mr @entity1 is a skilled conman and an accomplished liar who deliberately targeted a vulnerable widow , befriending her and gaining her trust			0
' he then took advantage of that friendship for his own gains until her money ran out			0
