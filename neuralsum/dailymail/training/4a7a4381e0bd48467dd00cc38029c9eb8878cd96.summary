by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 20:12 est , 24 july 2013 the blood was washed away years ago and the crime - scene tape has long since disappeared			1
yet there ’s still something eerily familiar about the five stone steps leading up to the elegant , @entity7 - style mansion , bathed in @entity9 sunshine and flanked by palm trees blowing in an ocean breeze			2
this is the spot where celebrated fashion designer @entity13 was gunned down by a serial killer , made famous by countless newspaper photographs and worldwide tv broadcasts			1
and now the house could be yours for a snip			0
from the roof the blue of the @entity35 and a fringe of palm trees can once again be glimpsed in the distance private dip : the mosaic pool is lined with 24 - carat gold tiles soaking up the sun : loungers await buyers who want to top up their tan by the pool after initially being offered for sale last year at $ 125million ( around £ 80million ) it is being put up for auction with a starting price of just $ 25million ( £ 16million )			1
but if you get past the former murder scene to the majestic arch of the huge front door , a peep through the keyhole – depending on your taste – might reveal even greater horrors in store			1
infamous : @entity13 was shot dead on the steps of the @entity24 mansion by @entity64 who then killed himself before police closed in taste free : the @entity67 features spectacularly clashing styles and a myriad of colours which are incompatible with a restful night 's sleep lavish detail : the walls of the @entity67 features handpainted murals of musicians in an exotic setting			2
the suite itself is opposite @entity13 's old bedroom who could possibly live here , in a house where the master bedroom resembles a cross between the @entity85 and a tart ’s boudoir ? surely a man with such genius for helping women to look beautiful would n’t have furnished his home thus ? and who might want to lash out a fortune on a place where the neighbours include a constant stream of @entity13 worshippers and celebrity - hunting ghouls posing for pictures at the gates ? naturally , those involved in the sale are quick to point out that @entity13 was slain outside the mansion , not in , when crazed attacker @entity64 struck in july 1997 before killing himself as a police search closed in			1
room with a view : a porthole in the observatory , left , and one of the mansion 's many foyers gleaming : a bath in the @entity113 , left , and a shower in the @entity116 wash room plush : living quarters include the the @entity119 which is crammed full of the familiar features of @entity122 design translated to a @entity9 beach setting grandiose : the @entity124 was once @entity13 's bedroom			1
sprawling accommodation includes feature pillars and a boldly tiled floor			0
there are also a number of balconies the @entity132 still hopes the @entity135 designer ’s legacy will be enough to attract a legion of bidders when the house goes up for auction on september 17			2
@entity13 spent $ 33million on renovations after buying the run - down 1930s mansion and a dilapidated hotel next door in 1992			2
the 23,000 sq ft property now boasts ten bedrooms , 11 bathrooms , a 54ft mosaic pool lined with 24 - carat gold tiles , and an open - air courtyard			1
it has gold - plated bathroom fixtures , of course ; plus mosaic floors and frescos he had custom made			0
although high walls block traffic sounds from the busy road outside , 1116 @entity156 has panoramic views of the sea from a rooftop observatory			0
the @entity13 family sold the house in 2000			0
it became a private club , then operated as a boutique hotel until earlier this year before a bankruptcy court appointed @entity169 to put the property up for auction			0
new owners kept many of the more elegant versace features but furnished the rooms ‘ uniquely ’			0
that furniture – including beds so large they need custom - made sheets – will be part of the sale			0
the mansion ’s provenance comes free of charge			0
wild style : estate agent @entity169 conducts a tour of the @entity186 including this room full of animal print decor the @entity113 is also known as the @entity190 room as it was where the singer stayed when she visited : it features an intricate floor with a mosaic face star - gazing : the roof to the observatory , left , and a telescope set up for viewing art exhibit : one of the bedrooms adorned with paintings time to relax : a decorative clock on a counter in the ' man cave ' room presence still felt : the @entity13 logo on one of the vases at the entrance to the mansion decorative : artwork stands near the front door , left , while another piece dominates this room			1
