by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor people living in @entity5 ’s 10 richest constituencies pay almost 10 per cent of the nation ’s tax bill , new figures show			1
all of the seats are in or around @entity9 and between them contribute £ 13.6billion - a - year , more than the whole of @entity13 , @entity14 and most @entity15 regions			1
the official data from @entity17 comes as chancellor @entity18 faces fresh criticism for failing to act to ease the burden on higher earners , with 5million people set to be dragged into the 40p rate			1
people living in these 10 @entity9 constituencies contribute £ 13.6billion in tax each year , equivalent to almost 10 per cent of the total tax paid by the whole country latest figures from @entity17 show that in 2011 - 12 total tax paid by individuals came to £ 165billion			1
the @entity32 constituency of @entity33 contributed £ 2.45billion , the @entity34 ( @entity32 ) £ 2.16billion and @entity35 and @entity36 ( @entity32 ) £ 1.87billion			0
@entity37 and @entity38 , where @entity40 ’s @entity39 is mp , contributed the fourth highest amount £ 1.47billion , followed by @entity42 ( @entity32 ) £ 1.16 , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) £ 1.15billion , @entity44 and @entity45 ( @entity32 ) £ 939million , @entity46 ( @entity32 ) £ 930million , @entity43 ( @entity32 ) £ 874million and @entity49 and @entity50 ( @entity40 ) £ 823million			0
together the constituencies account for 906,000 people paying more tax than 2.64million living in the @entity54			2
by contrast @entity55 in @entity56 paid just £ 92million in tax , the lowest in the country			2
other low tax areas include @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
the figures reveal the over-reliance on @entity9 as an economic powerhouse , with a small number of mega-rich individuals bankrolling much of the public sector			1
the figures show that the top 10 constituencies contribute more tax than @entity13 , @entity76 , @entity14 and most @entity15 regions @entity79 , from @entity80 think tank , said : ‘ @entity9 is now home to the largest number of millionaires in the entire world and their taxes continue to prop up the rest of the country			1
‘ it was n’t always this way			0
but as northern towns and cities suffered the effects of deindustrialisation , @entity9 ’s dominant service based economy grew , leading to a brain drain of talent to the capital			0
‘ @entity9 is one of the world ’s leading cities and we should look to maximise its potential			0
’ he said the government had to make other cities more attractive for the next generation of millionaires			0
‘ investing in better transport links , building more homes through a more streamlined planning system and aligning public sector and private sector pay to boost job creation are all measures that will help attract @entity5 born and foreign business leaders to set up home in other regions of the @entity5			1
’ however the situation is likely to be exacerbated by plans to further increase the amount of money people can earn before paying tax			0
mr @entity18 used his budget on wednesday to announce the income tax threshold will rise by another £ 500 to £ 10,500			1
@entity32 chancellor @entity18 has faced calls to ease the tax burden on middle earners but @entity130 deputy pm @entity129 has insisted tax cuts be focused on low and middle earners the top 25 per cent of earners will contribute 75 per cent of the total £ 167billion income tax @entity129 , who has championed the @entity130 policy , claims this ‘ workers ’ bonus ’ will be worth an extra £ 100 - a - year			1
but @entity32 @entity138 are angry at the refusal of the @entity140 to offer more help to those people dragged into paying 40p tax rate			1
since the coalition was formed mr @entity18 has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start the higher rate of tax			0
it means that of 2million more people sucked into the 40p rate since the last election , 1.4million more than would have been affected under @entity40 ’s plans			2
those caught by @entity18 ’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £ 546 worse off next year , according to the respected @entity159			2
but the chancellor ’s changes to @entity40 ’s plans for the 40p rate , once reserved for the wealthiest in society , mean the @entity140 has raked in an extra £ 3.6billion			0
if @entity40 ’s plans had been adhered to by mr @entity18 , people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £ 47,845 in 2015 - 16			1
this year 4.4million people will pay the 40p rate , up from just 3.02million when the coalition was formed in 2010 and only 1.35million in 1988			2
if it had risen in line with wage growth , the 40p rate would only apply to someone earning more than £ 75,000			0
instead it has fallen to £ 41,450			0
official figures show that in 2013 - 14 , the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax , while the top ten per cent , on £ 47,913 or more , will account for 59 per cent			1
the top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent , or £ 47billion			0
the @entity140 said that thanks to the £ 10,000 allowance , in 2013 - 14 , higher rate taxpayers are about £ 45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation .			0

income tax cut for low earners means more is raised from the wealthy
just 10 @entity9 seats pay £ 13.6billion in tax , more than @entity76 and @entity13
think tank warns of over-reliance on millionaires to bankroll public sector
5million people will be caught in 40p tax band by next year , says @entity159
