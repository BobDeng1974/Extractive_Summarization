by @entity0 published : 17:57 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 01:32 est , 12 october 2012 town hall chiefs last night vowed to kill off @entity3 ’s plan to allow large extensions in back gardens			1
they warned his free - for - all would encourage unsightly development and spark tension between neighbours			1
in a huge blow to the @entity13 ’s flagship housing policy , the @entity10 said councils would not implement the plans			1
blow : town hall chiefs vowed to kill off @entity3 's plan to allow large extensions in back gardens homeowners can currently build a 10ft extension at a terraced property – and 13ft at a detached house – without planning consent			1
mr @entity3 wants these limits doubled to 20ft and 26ft for a three - year period			1
the move is needed to boost the economy , the prime minister says			2
but without the co-operation of town hall chiefs the policy is unlikely to be implemented			2
last year councils rejected outright only 22,000 of the 200,000 applications they received			1
and the @entity10 , which represents more than 370 councils , fears that without such scrutiny these failed plans would now go ahead			1
‘ this policy potentially gives the green light to unsightly and out - of - place development without delivering a big enough boost to the construction industry to justify the potential damage , ’ said the association ’s @entity39			1
‘ the planning process works to ensure development is suitable for a local area and does n’t unduly impact neighbours			2
loosening rules around extensions would eliminate this vital mediation process in a large number of cases			2
the 22,000 applications which are rejected each year are knocked back for good reasons and it would be totally wrong if extensions which were previously rejected due to objections from neighbours or because they were judged to blight the neighbourhood could now sneak back in unimpeded			1
’ @entity64 - run councils in @entity65 and in @entity66 , @entity67 , have already said they will not cooperate with the new policy			2
@entity65 said a ‘ rash of extensions ’ could increase the risk of flooding in the low - lying county			0
additions : homeowners can currently build a 10ft extension at a terraced property - and 13ft at a detached house - without planning consent at their party conference , the @entity80 rank and file also voted against the proposals			0
and a @entity85 poll commissioned by the @entity86 revealed 54 per cent believe the shake - up would lower the quality of neighbourhood design			0
' this policy potentially gives the green light to unsightly and out - of - place development without delivering a big enough boost to the construction industry to justify the potential damage ' @entity39 , @entity10 the @entity10 ’s intervention sets the stage for a clash between town hall chiefs and @entity100			1
the communities secretary has warned that homeowners could sue councils that refuse to follow the new guidance on extensions			1
ministers have said however that it will be up to each council as to whether to cooperate			0
the @entity10 ’s warning is also a challenge to mr @entity3 , who repeated calls for growth - friendly planning changes in his speech to the @entity64 conference in @entity115 this week			1
the prime minister attacked ‘ yes - but - no people ’ – ‘ the ones who say “ yes , our businesses need to expand but no we ca n’t reform planning ” ’			0
mr @entity39 countered : ‘ we agree with the government that stimulating the construction industry is essential to economic recovery but this proposal is not the answer			0
we need to tackle the housing crisis and that means freeing up lending so first - time buyers can secure mortgages and developers can borrow to build			0
extensions : a @entity85 poll commissioned by the @entity86 revealed 54 per cent believe the shake - up would lower the quality of neighbourhood design ‘ the government should also lift tight restrictions on local authority borrowing so councils and housing associations can raise money to invest in new homes			2
’ planning minister @entity144 , who is a @entity65 mp , hit back , saying : ‘ the planning system needs to strike a balance between the rights of the homeowner and their neighbours			0
' the planning system needs to strike a balance between the rights of the homeowner and their neighbours ' @entity144 , planning minister ‘ our proposals will make it easier for thousands of hard - working families to undertake home improvements to cater for a growing family			0
it will also help generate new business for local construction companies and small traders			0
’ when the plans emerged , @entity163 , the @entity80 leader of @entity165 council in @entity67 , said : ‘ these proposals are a recipe for disaster			2
they have not been properly thought through			0
‘ if this is allowed to happen it will set neighbour against neighbour and split communities for years			0
on top of the resentment and loss of quality of life , some people ’s houses will also plummet in value if they ’ve got no light or a noisy factory is within a few metres of their front door			0
