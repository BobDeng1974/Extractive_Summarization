it 's that time of year again , and football clubs are doing their bit to wish their loyal fans a @entity4			2
however some get it right , others not so much			0
@entity8 became the latter when they roped in three of their biggest stars to wail their own rendition of a classic christmas carol			0
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 were the choirboys on this occasion , albeit horrifically off key			1
@entity15 and @entity14 have something to laugh about as they wish fans a merry @entity4 starting with @entity24 bawler @entity16 , the trio belt out a version of ' @entity27 ’			1
taking the baton , @entity15 and @entity14 take over to round it all off and wish their fans ' a @entity32 ’ , before bursting into a fit of laughter ... probably at the sound of their lazy larynges			2
one thing can be said as the @entity38 concentrate on staying top of the @entity41 table over the festive period going into monday 's game at @entity43 - stick to the day job , guys .			0

@entity8 join in on the *festivities* by *releasing* a @entity4 **video** for fans
