but he dismissed the idea of giving up the multimillion - pound management charge			0
mr @entity8 said : ' i do n’t think @entity9 should receive their £ 57 million management fee for services provided to the @entity13			1
' frankly it beggars belief that they think they are entitled to it			0
' under pressure : no10 sources said the government ' will be very aggressive ' in reclaiming funds from @entity9			2
its chief executive @entity53 , is pictured there is speculation that a request may be made today for up to 2,000 additional troops to plug any further gaps in security if @entity9 ’s problems become more severe			2

however , mr @entity8 said the security giant ’s ambition must be put on hold			0
' before they are awarded any new policing contracts , we need a review of @entity9 ’s ability to deliver , ' he said			2
mr @entity22 and mr @entity8 have stressed that they expect the @entity13 to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build - up			1

speaking during a visit to @entity116 , prime minister @entity22 said : ' if a company does n't fulfil its contracts , then that company should be gone after for that money and that 's exactly what 's going to happen in the case of @entity9			1
bright lights : a view of @entity133 as flood lights are tested at the @entity135 ' i think it 's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver			0
' but of course the government 's interest , the interest of the @entity13 , the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful @entity13 is done			1
' we 've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that			0
we activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that			0
' but i could n't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that are n't fulfilled will have consequences , including pretty tough financial consequences			0
' i think @entity9 , in apologising for their performance , have already made clear that they realise that fact			0
' later , @entity161 sought to reassure @entity13 ticket holders from around the world that the @entity13 would be safe and secure			1
when asked at an @entity166 press conference if yesterday 's bomb attack on a bus full of @entity170 holidaymakers in @entity171 presented extra security challenges to the @entity13 , the @entity164 replied : ' obviously we 're monitoring the whole time what 's happening with respect to the changing security situation			0
' we have extremely competent intelligence services who are giving us advice and we 're responding to that on an ongoing basis			0
' but the world can be absolutely certain that we will deliver a safe and secure @entity13			1
