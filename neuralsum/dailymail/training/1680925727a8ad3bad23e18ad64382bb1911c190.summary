by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 11 june 2013 costly : more than 900 doctors surgeries around the @entity2 still have 0844 phone numbers - with many taking a cut of the call charges to their patients hundreds of @entity7 are still making patients pay just to call for an appointment – despite the practice being banned three years ago			1
the @entity11 has outlawed the use of premium rate 0844 numbers for @entity16 services but more than 900 surgeries are still using them			1
calling a family doctor on an 0844 line costs up to 41p a minute from a mobile and 5p a minute plus a 13p set - up fee from a @entity23 landline			1
most surgeries using such lines take a slice of the call charges run up by patients , which generally range from 2p - 7p a minute			1
this means patients are effectively subsidising their family doctors			0
@entity33 , founder of the @entity34 , which fights for consumer rights , said : ‘ the @entity16 is funded by taxation			0
‘ it is unacceptable that gps take an additional tax on our calls			0
that tax by telephone is unacceptable			0
‘ the fundamental principles of our nhs do not permit providers to fund services at the expense of patients			0
’ his research shows that 839 surgeries in @entity52 , plus 40 in @entity53 , 38 in @entity54 and 21 in @entity55 are still using 0844 numbers			1
this defies official regulations issued in april 2010 ruling that @entity16 bodies , including gps , should not charge more for a call than the cost of dialling a local number			2
many gps were encouraged to install expensive state - of - the - art systems by telecom companies on the basis the cost would be covered through call charges to patients			1
mr @entity33 said this was a poor decision and doctors should carry the cost instead of passing it on			0
customers of @entity77 are charged 41p a minute to call an 0844 number while the figure is 40p with @entity80 and @entity81			1
a ten - minute call , which includes being put on hold , could cost as much as £ 4.10			1
unfair : the @entity34 argues that @entity7 are funded by @entity85 taxation - and they do not have the right to impose an additional levy on patients calling their surgeries ( stock image ) ‘ gps were given 12 months from april 2010 to change their numbers but they did not do it , ’ said mr @entity33			1
‘ this needs to stop now			0
’ he said the surgeries should switch to 03 numbers , which carry the same charges as 01 and 02 with no extras			2
new rules from @entity100 will require organisations such as @entity103 surgeries to reveal how much they receive per minute from premium rate lines			2
campaigners hope this will shame the culprits into action			0
the @entity108 said many of the @entity7 involved will have to wait until long - term contracts with telecom firms end			2
dr @entity112 said surgeries had been encouraged by officials to sign up			0
‘ services have improved as a result but it is understandable patients are irritated , ’ he added .			0

more than 900 surgeries around the @entity2 are still using costly 0844 numbers
calling an 0844 number costs 41p a minute from a mobile and 5p a minute plus a 13p set - up fee from a @entity23 landline
most surgeries using such lines take a *percentage* of the call charges
