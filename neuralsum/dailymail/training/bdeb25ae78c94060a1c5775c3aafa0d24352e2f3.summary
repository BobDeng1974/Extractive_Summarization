by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 05:15 est , 23 april 2013 keeping the car is n’t usually the priority for a woman going through a break - up			0
but when there ’s a £ 380,000 @entity6 at stake ... @entity8 yesterday found herself embroiled in a legal battle with her ex-boyfriend over the ownership of the futuristic black sports car			1
pleased : miss @entity8 leaves the @entity13 with her fiance @entity14 having won the first stage of her legal battle today row : @entity8 leaving the @entity6 at the heart of the case , which her ex sold claiming it was a gift but she says it was n't and wants it back @entity23 alleges that , although miss @entity8 bought the car , she gave it to him as a 38th birthday present last april			1
she denies this and claims it always belonged to her			0
however , miss @entity8 secured a minor victory in the first round of her fight for the @entity6 following a hearing at the @entity13 yesterday			1
cutting a glamorous figure in a tight - fitting dress and six - inch @entity35 heels , she grinned with delight and held the hand of her new fiance @entity14 after she was told the car could not be shipped overseas to a @entity41 buyer			2
sour : miss @entity8 with mr @entity23 in @entity47 before their break - up and the row over the expensive car they both claim to own special : the @entity6 is one of the world 's rarest cars and has allegedly been sold to a @entity41 national who is trying to have it shipped out of the @entity53 instead it will be stored in a garage of her choice until the matter had been resolved			1
miss @entity8 and mr @entity23 dated for two and a half years but three months after being given the keys to the sports car , their relationship came to an end after mr @entity23 was caught on a sex tape and the footage sent to her billionaire father @entity65			1
miss @entity8 initially kept the car following their split but matters came to a head this month when it was taken to a garage in @entity73 , west @entity74 , for a routine service			1
what then followed was an extraordinary chain of events			0
while at the garage , bailiffs from @entity74 county court impounded the car			0
unbeknown to @entity81 , 28 , mr @entity23 had used the @entity6 as security for a £ 250,000 loan with @entity84 – the dealership which sold her the car – and was being charged a staggering interest rate of 70 per cent			1
despite the car being impounded , mr @entity23 allegedly persuaded bailiffs to release the @entity6 , and he gave the vehicle to @entity84 , apparently in settlement of his debts			1
the car was then sold to a company called @entity92 for £ 118,000 cash plus a £ 132,000 mercedes in part exchange , and then sold again to a @entity41 buyer			2
blocked : @entity23 leaves the £ 380,000 car in june 2012 when he and @entity8 were a couple			2
his ex gained an injunction keeping it under lock and key in @entity53 today commenting on the complicated sequence of events , mr @entity102 said that if the @entity6 was never a gift to mr @entity23 , then he never had title to it and could not sell it			1
he added mr @entity23 had got the car back in ‘ extraordinary and unusual circumstances ’ and said : ‘ the underlying dispute is about the ownership of the car			2
it is between the complainant and the first defendant			0
‘ she is saying that it is hers and he is saying that although she bought it , he was given it as a present during the currency of their relationship			0
‘ miss @entity8 is entitled to see it sitting in a safe place which is not connected with any of the defendants			2
’ within hours of the relationship breaking down between miss @entity8 and mr @entity23 , it is believed she began dividing their assets into ‘ his and hers ’ lots worth hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
first , she locked up her collection of supercars , which they both drove – including the @entity6 and a @entity137 599 worth £ 212,096 – in a private garage away from the £ 4million @entity139 home the couple shared			0
the model and television presenter then arranged for two other cars and jewellery worth more than £ 145,000 to be delivered to mr @entity23 ’s mother ’s house in @entity148 , @entity74			0
the items included a yellow gold @entity153 ’ bracelet worth £ 26,250 and matching silver one costing £ 36,500			0
the cars included a £ 123,000 white @entity155 with personalised ‘ @entity159 ’ numberplates , a @entity157 present from mr @entity23 , and a £ 76,000 black @entity158			0
the injunction protecting the safe - keeping of the @entity6 remains in force until the dispute between miss @entity8 , mr @entity23 , @entity84 and @entity164 is resolved			1
no date has been fixed for that hearing			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity23 claims the rare @entity6 was given to him as a birthday gift
vehicle was then allegedly sold on to a @entity41 collector
miss @entity8 discovers *transaction* and launches *custody* battle
judge sides with her and agrees injunction to keep supercar in @entity53
a hearing later this year will decide who the @entity6 belongs to
