leaning casually on the table with a cigarette in one hand as he watches his country ’s satellite soar into space , @entity1 ’s pose is oddly familiar			1
worryingly familiar , in fact – for it lends him a distinct resemblance to dr no , the original @entity14 ’s rocket launch on wednesday earned @entity1 virtual global condemnation , alienating even long - standing allies such as @entity17 and @entity18 , while reports in the @entity20 suggested that the spacecraft might be ‘ tumbling out of control ’			1
one official described an earlier @entity25 rocket design as ‘ a dishwasher wrapped in tin foil ’			1
but at home , the 28 - year - old dictator ’s gamble was being hailed as a major triumph , with tens of thousands staging a mass rally in the capital , @entity35 , as a tribute			0
but much of the rest of the world sees it as a thinly disguised test of banned long - range missile technology			0
in 1962 ’s dr no , the first @entity73 film , @entity71 ’s 007 takes on dr @entity75 , who is plotting to disrupt a @entity20 space launch with an atomic beam			0
naturally , @entity73 foils the plan – pushing the evil scientist to his death in the reactor ’s cooling vat			0
the photo was released as thousands of people took to the streets of the country 's capital of @entity35 to participate in a mass rally today			0
meanwhile in @entity90 , the rocket debris was recovered by the navy with inspectors analysing it to ascertain the rocket 's techological capabilities			0
the launch came only eight months after a very public rocket launch failure and less than a year on the job , the decision to go ahead was a big gamble for0 @entity25 's young leader			1
it paid off , at least in the short term , projecting @entity1 to his people as powerful , capable and determined			2
on the other hand it will increase his country 's international isolation and could strengthen the hands of the only entity that poses a threat to his rule : the military			0
@entity25 gathered en masse in a staged demonstration , partly to glorify @entity1 and partly to celebrate the launch of the rocket , which @entity35 says put a crop and weather monitoring satellite into orbit			1
the rest of the world saw it as a thinly - disguised test of banned long - range missile technology			0
the launch 's success , 14 years after @entity25 's first attempt , shows more than a little of the gambling spirit in the third @entity1 to rule @entity25 since it became a country in 1948			1
' @entity25 officials will long be touting @entity1 as a gutsy leader who commanded the rocket launch despite being new to the job and young ' , said @entity136 , a @entity25 specialist at @entity137 in @entity90			1
sea of support : hundreds of thousands of @entity25 rallied today in the freezing cold to revel in the country 's successful rocket launch as @entity90 voiced concern that its rival could follow up with a third nuclear test fired up : @entity147 , @entity25 's @entity43 rocket lifts off from the @entity150 launch pad in @entity150 , @entity25 ; right , he retrieved debris from the first stage of the rocket on the deck of a @entity90 milliary vessel at a naval base in @entity157 , about 70 kilometers south of @entity158 @entity25 state media said @entity1 himself issued the order to fire the rocket on wednesday despite the prospect of another failure and condemnation from abroad			1
@entity1 was praised for boldly carrying out his father and former leader @entity168 's last wish before his death in december last year			1
@entity168 had made development of missiles and nuclear weapons a priority despite international opposition and his nation 's crushing poverty			0
his son 's success is likely to help him consolidate his power over a government crammed with elderly , old - school lieutenants of his father and grandfather , foreign analysts said			0
but what is unclear is whether @entity1 will continue to smoothly solidify power , steering clear of friction with the powerful military while dealing with the strong possibility of more crushing sanctions against a country with what the @entity193 calls a serious hunger problem			2
' certainly in the short run , this is an enormous boost to his prestige , ' said @entity199 , a @entity25 analyst at the @entity200 in @entity201			2
inspection : the wreckage of @entity25 's rocket is seen at the @entity206 's naval base today in @entity157 , @entity90			1
the debris is from the first stage of the long range rocket show of support : a banner reading ' @entity47 satellite 2nd version ' is held aloft at a mass rally in @entity215 in @entity25 's captial of @entity35 to celebrate the success of a rocket launch military might : slogans honouring the leadership are displayed during the mass rally organized to celebrate the success of a rocket launch that sent a satellite into space on @entity215 in @entity35 people power : @entity25 applaud near a slogan which reads ' ì ( we ) fervently celebrate the successful launch of the second version of the @entity47 satellite 2nd version ' regimented : @entity231 - faced soldiers celebrate the successful launch of the @entity43 rocket , carrying the satellite @entity47 , at @entity215 in @entity35 rank and file : @entity25 soldiers attend a mass rally organised to celebrate the success of a rocket launch that sent a satellite into space at @entity215 in @entity35 @entity199 , however , also mentioned the ' @entity244 argument ' that this could cause future problems for @entity1 by significantly boosting the power of the military - ' the only real threat to his rule			1
' there is also the question whether @entity1 , after thumbing his nose at the world by firing the rocket , will continue to ignore the universal wisdom that ' @entity25 's only hope for escaping economic implosion is for the country to open up economically , ' said @entity260 , @entity261 director at the @entity262 think tank in @entity201			1
as a cold wave lifted , tens of thousands of people gathered at the snowy @entity215 on friday , some dancing in the plaza before the rally began , continuing beer - filled street celebrations that had started on wednesday			0
top officials told the people the critics abroad were characterizing the launch as a missile test			0
denying the claims , they urged @entity25 to stand defiant in the face of outside condemnation			2
inspection : @entity90 sailors stand guard today near a part of debris from the @entity25 rocket on a @entity284 ship at the 2nd @entity286 headquarters in @entity157 , @entity90 interesting cargo : the debris is believed to be a fuel container from the first stage of the rocket			2
defence officials said @entity90 has no plans to return the shell to @entity25 because the launch violated @entity193 council resolutions vital statistics : this photo has been annotated and released by the @entity299 via @entity300			2
it shows the dimensions of the debris for the rocket , perched on a ship off the port of @entity307 missile madness : as the @entity20 led international condemnation of what it calls a covert test of missile technology , top @entity25 officials denied the allegations and maintained the country 's right to develop its space program despite the success , experts say @entity25 is years from even having a shot at developing reliable missiles that could bombard the @entity20 mainland and other distant targets			1
a missile program is built on decades of systematic , intricate testing , something extremely difficult for economically struggling @entity35 , which faces guaranteed sanctions and world disapproval each time it stages an expensive launch			0
@entity25 will need larger and more dependable missiles , and more advanced nuclear weapons , to threaten @entity20 shores , though it already poses a shorter - range missile threat to its neighbors			2
successfully firing a rocket , however , was so politically crucial for @entity1 at the onset of his rule that he allowed the april launch to go through even though it resulted in the collapse of a nascent food - aid - for - nuclear - freeze deal with the @entity20 , @entity25 analyst @entity336 in @entity158 said			1
the launch success ' consolidates his image as true successor of his father 's songun ( military - first ) leadership , but it will also deepen his country 's economic isolation because sanctions will get tougher			0
' that will hurt his image as an economically savvy leader and undermine his legitimacy for the next two to three years , ' @entity1 said			2
conference : @entity25 leader @entity1 ( c ) talks with officials at the @entity39 and @entity40 before the launch of the @entity43 rocket decision - maker : in a sparsely - decorated office @entity25 leader @entity1 gives the order to launch the country 's first three - stage rocket all smiles : @entity1 grins as he celebrates news of the rocket 's successful launch at the general satellite control and command centre in @entity35 the next big question is how the outside world will react			1
@entity376 condemnation has already come ; more sanctions may follow , both from the @entity193 and individual countries			0
@entity379 , a @entity380 specialist for the @entity381 , wrote recently that the launch and @entity25 's nuclear ambitions should inspire cooperation between the often wary @entity20 and @entity17 , and @entity90 and @entity385			2
if there is a common threat that should galvanize regional cooperation ' it most certainly should be the prospect of a 30 - year - old leader of a terrorized population with his finger on a nuclear trigger , ' @entity379 said			0
how advanced ? the @entity25 letters inscribed on the debris read ' @entity395 '			0
the debris , believed to be a fuel tank , will be analysed to determine its level of ballistic expertise , the defence ministry said tense : @entity376 condemnation has already come following the rocket launch and more sanctions may follow , both from the @entity193 and individual countries video : thousands take to the streets in the @entity25 capital of @entity35 to celebrate the country 's successful satellite rocket missile launch			1

success comes eight months after leader @entity1 was publicly humiliated when a satellite launch ended in failure
@entity25 state media said @entity1 himself issued the order to fire rocket
