by @entity0 for @entity1 a veterinary student whose face was paralysed in a car crash can today show her emotions again after having pioneering ' smile transplant ' surgery			1
@entity8 , 29 , woke from a 13 - day coma to discover every muscle in her face had been paralysed and all her nerves were damaged			1
she was left with her mouth permanently open , unable to blink or produce tears , with one eye stuck open and the other closed			1
but after years of being unable to raise a smile she tracked down a plastic reconstructive surgeon who carried out an incredible operation to attach a muscle from her temple to her mouth muscles			1
@entity8 , 29 , from @entity22 in @entity23 underwent a ' smile transplant ' ( pictured right ) after being left with her face paralysed ( pictured left ) after a car crash the crash happened as she was driving to family home in @entity28 , @entity29 , after her second term at university in february 2008			1
she skidded on water and lost control of the car the ten - and - a - half hour ' smile transplant ' means she can now smile , blink , cry and frown			1
although she had survived the car crash , ms @entity37 , from @entity22 in @entity23 , said losing the ability to communicate using normal facial expressions was extremely difficult			1
‘ i was always told i was lucky to be alive , letting alone walking and talking , ’ she said			0
‘ but i did n't feel lucky			0
it was n't very nice to be a 22 or 23 - year - old girl walking out into the world like that everyday			0
‘ it was n't just not being able to smile - it was all the other emotions too			2
i could n't even look angry			0
’ the crash happened as she was driving to family home in @entity28 , @entity29 , after her second term at university in february 2008			0
she skidded on water and lost control of the car			0
another vehicle smashed into her passenger side , ramming the door into her head and crushing the bone canal containing the facial nerves			0
the crash left her with five skull fractures , a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull			2
the crash left her with five skull fractures , a bleed on the brain and traumatic injuries to the base of her skull the term facial palsy generally refers to weakness of the facial muscles , mainly resulting from temporary or permanent damage to the facial nerve			1
when a facial nerve is either non-functioning or missing , the muscles in the face do not receive the necessary signals in order to function properly			0
this results in paralysis of the affected part of the face , which can affect movement of the eye ( s ) and / or the mouth , as well as other areas			1
there are different degrees of facial paralysis : sometimes only the lower half of the face is affected , sometimes one whole side of the face is affected and in some cases both sides of the face are affected			1
source : @entity100 @entity99 her family feared she would never pull through , but after a 13 - day induced coma she came round			1
after three months in hospital she was finally discharged , with doctors reassuring her that her face would eventually recover			2
but while she learned to walk and talk the paralysis of her face , known as ‘ bilateral facial palsy ’ did not improve and she still could not show any emotion			1
she said it was difficult to have to re-learn how to carry out basic tasks , and her determination to get back to normal			0
‘ when i woke up i was like a small child			0
i had to learn to walk and talk and eat again			0
‘ but my first words i spoke were " i can "			0
' doctors told her there was nothing they could do for her face , but her mother saw a programme on tv where pioneering surgeon @entity121 explained his first ' smile transplant '			1
ms @entity37 ( pictured left and right before the accident ) helped launch charity @entity100 in 2012 ms @entity37 , said : ' when i woke up i was like a small child			1
i had to learn to walk and talk and eat again			0
but my first words i spoke were " i can " ' last month the 29 - year - old , pictured left after the operation , was given one of @entity132 's @entity134 awards , which honours volunteers , right in february 2011 , a doctor at @entity138 in @entity139 carried out the complex @entity141 procedure - where the muscles which ran from ms @entity37 's temple to her jaw were detached at the bottom			1
they were then flipped over , her jaw was removed , and the muscles were attached to her smile muscles , allowing her to pull up the corners of her mouth			2
a week later she had surgery to insert small platinum chains in her eye lids to make them weighted to help them close			0
she had to work hard in physiotherapy sessions to strengthen the two muscles in her face - which now have to do the work of 14 muscles - but after eight weeks she could raise a small smile			2
just last month she had a further operation to adjust the tightness of the muscles			2
wanting to share her experience with others , ms @entity37 helped launch the charity @entity100 @entity99 in 2012 and last month was given @entity132 's @entity170 award , which honours volunteers			1
although her brain injury means she ca n't work because she suffers from migraines , depression and exhaustion , she feels her operation was life - changing			2
‘ now i like to test it			0
‘ when i used to go out and about people would stare and i would look away			0
now i catch someone 's eye and try and smile at them , and now , unlike before , they smile back			2
