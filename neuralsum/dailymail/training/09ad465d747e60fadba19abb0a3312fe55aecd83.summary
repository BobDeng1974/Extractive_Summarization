@entity8 said we he was offered the position of @entity11 at @entity12 in june 2012 , and told that he must start attending the school 's baptist church			1
the administrator , assistant administrator , athletic director and daycare director are all supposed to be members of it 's church , according to an undocumented school policy			1
out of the game : coach phillips on the @entity23 court before he was forced to resign because of his wavering church loyalties @entity26 values : @entity8 and his wife @entity27			1
for a year @entity8 would take his family to church service at both @entity23 and the @entity30 @entity8 had previously taught @entity31 and science , and was the boys basketball coach as well as an assistant football coach			1
for the first year @entity8 tried to make it work , taking his family to the 9am service at @entity38 before ferrying them to the 11am service at @entity30 in @entity41			0
but at the end of the year he was tired of his double - church life			0
he went to school administrators asking for permission to go back to his old congregation			0
' in a nutshell , i told them i miss my old church , ' @entity8 told the @entity51			1
' i went in to share my heart to a pastor			0
knowing what might happen , but kind of saying , " maybe we can work something out ? ’ " strict school : @entity8 tried to reason with school administrators to let him be demoted so he could continue coaching , but they refused faithful : @entity8 just wanted to go to his own church , @entity30 in @entity41 , @entity1 @entity8 said his confession was not well received			1
@entity8 did n't hear back from school administrators until the end of june , when they met twice			2
at the second meeting @entity8 was forced to resign			2
and though he was never a member of the school 's church before he became @entity11 , the school refused to compromise on keeping him employed			1
@entity8 asked to be demoted so could he continue to teach and coach basketball but they said no. what makes @entity8 most upset is the fact that the church membership was not discussed more or spelled out in his contract			2
taken out : @entity8 also served as an assistant coach of the football team ' if it had have been in my contract , i possibly would have not taken the job , ' @entity8 said			0
' i was totally committed to @entity23 ( the school )			0
i thought i did enough to prove i did n’t have to be a member to do my job effectively			0
' in response to @entity8 resignation , the school issued a statement to the @entity51 saying : ' for several months , we discussed with coach phillips the requirements of his position at @entity12 and after months of discussion and prayer , coach @entity8 resigned his duties here			1
' it was made very clear when we hired @entity8 that the @entity11 position is required to be a faithful member of our sponsoring church @entity100			2
' but @entity8 still does n't understand how he lost his job because of his faith			0
' i was an advocate of @entity23 as the athletic director			0
that ’s what i thought my role was , ' he said .			0
