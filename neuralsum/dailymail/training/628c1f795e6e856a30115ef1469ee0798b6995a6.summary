the bra is not currently on sale and there is no indication as to whether it will be made , but the prototype has a front clasp with a sensor and light that glows pink ( pictured ) if the wearer is in love with a person nearby an app seemingly processes the data – measuring heart rate elevation using a specially built algorithm as well as pre-set data - and only when a woman ’s heart rate is suitably elevated and she is in love does the bra catch open , @entity74 reported			1
while some would - be wearers might worry that any excitement might cause their underwear to ping off , the creators of the bra say that the catch will only be released when a woman is in love so that her @entity88 ( part of the adrenal gland ) secretes the hormone @entity92 , which increases her heart rate			0
