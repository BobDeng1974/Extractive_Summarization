a stroke of luck may have helped police prevent a high - profile terrorist attack in the run - up to the @entity6 , it emerged yesterday			1
a routine stop by officers on the @entity9 led to the discovery of two guns , ammunition and other weapons ‘ hidden ’ in a car			1
the discovery fuelled speculation that a suspect terror cell planned to go on the rampage in a scaled - down version of the @entity21 terror attacks which left 174 people dead in 2008			1
seven suspected @entity24 extremists were later arrested and police have been given more time to question one of them - a 43 - year - old man from @entity28 , @entity29 , who was detained in @entity30 , @entity31 , on thursday			1
held : three men have been charged with terrorism offences after a police operation in which firearms were found in a car stopped by police on the @entity9 police now have until july 12 to charge or release the man , or apply for more time			1
officers have already been given warrants of further detention for the six other suspects , who are all from the @entity44			1
the arrests deepened fears that fanatics may be plotting mass murder during the @entity6			1
today is the seventh anniversary of the july 7 attacks in @entity51 in 2005			1
security officials have said that terrorists are most likely to attack targets outside the capital			2
they also concede that a strike against a major provincial town or city would be seen as an attack on the @entity6 – grabbing world - wide publicity			2
@entity63 officials have confirmed that a target had been identified			2
@entity65 said that following the @entity9 traffic stop , three men aged 23 , 26 and 27 from @entity67 , @entity68 , were arrested on tuesday morning			1
three more suspects , a 22 - year - old from @entity70 , @entity68 , a 24 - year - old from the @entity73 area of the city , and a 22 - year - old from @entity76 , @entity44 , were arrested on wednesday evening			2
while there was a huge sigh of relief that detectives had thwarted a possible ‘ spectacular ’ , there were concerns over the length of time it took police to discover the weapons			1
on guard : the country is at a heightened state of alert because of the upcoming @entity6 the vehicle was pulled over during a routine stop between junctions 33 and 34 on the southbound @entity9 near @entity94 last saturday			2
it was impounded on suspicion of having no insurance , but the driver and passenger were not taken into custody and the car not searched			2
on monday , the vehicle was searched by police and the arms cache discovered			1
it is understood a member of staff routinely patrolling the compound may have spotted something suspicious			2
background inquiries on the driver and passenger then revealed they were possible @entity24 extremists known to the security services			2
a massive operation was launched to arrest them and several associates			2
the fact that five other men were arrested , as well as those in the car , led to speculation police had moved in on a list of known associates			1
@entity122 defended the delay in finding the weapons			0
it said : ‘ this was a routine traffic police stop			1
‘ a search of the vehicle would have required grounds for suspicion			0
there was nothing initially to indicate that these kinds of items were being carried			0
items were later discovered at the vehicle compound			0
’ two firearms were recovered			0
neither was automatic and they were not loaded , police said			1
there was also a small amount of ammunition			0
detective chief superintendent @entity143 , head of the @entity144 , said : ‘ as soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle , our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved			0
’ police said the contents of the car , which was stopped close to the @entity155 shopping centre , were undergoing forensic analysis and the suspects ’ homes had been searched			1
all seven men are being held in the @entity44			1
sources said their arrests are not connected to the detention of six people in @entity51 on thursday , who were believed to have been plotting a terrorist attack to coincide with the @entity6			0
according to a report yesterday , the gang may have been planning to use a sword			0
officers have not ruled out the possibility that both sets of suspects were planning an attack to mark the 7th anniversary today of the july 7 attacks which claimed 52 lives			0
police hope that computers and phones seized during the arrests , as well as scrutiny of the suspects ’ travel movements , will provide further clues about their intentions			1
the arrests may help to explain the huge police response to the fake cigarette ‘ terror alert ’ which brought the @entity189 to a standstill in @entity191 on thursday			1
dozens of armed officers , troops , firefighters and bomb disposal experts swooped on the scene after a coach passenger reported smoke coming from a bag			0
it later emerged the alert was prompted by a passenger using an electronic cigarette which emitted a vapour			0
the @entity207 terrorism threat level is unchanged from ‘ substantial ’ , which means a terrorist attack is a ‘ strong possibility ’			0
there are two higher levels – ’ severe ’ , meaning an attack is ‘ highly likely ’ , and ‘ critical ’ , meaning an attack is ‘ expected imminently ’			0
police last night revealed they have been given more time to question six men from the @entity44 who have been arrested on suspicion of planning terrorist acts			1
officers now have until wednesday to charge or release them or apply for a further @entity219 reporting by @entity220			0
killing spree : one of the @entity21 gunmen in 2008 @entity207 's security services have been haunted by the spectre of a @entity21 - style terror attack on these shores for four years.in november 2008 , gunmen went on the rampage in @entity230 ’s largest city , attacking hotels and public buildings			0
they murdered more than 170 and injured hundreds more in four days of @entity233 then , @entity207 counter-terrorism officers have been braced for a @entity235 were forced to consider how to deal with terrorists fanning out across a city , in what two ex-sas commanders said would be akin to a ‘ slow - motion 9/11 ’			0
millions have been spent upgrading heavy weaponry available to armed response @entity245 officers were trained , including a squad of 100 with automatic weapons inside the @entity248			0
it is also thought @entity251 teams not on duty overseas have been puton standby to deal with hostage @entity253 two guns and the small amount of ammunition seized on the @entity9 does not bear comparison to the armoury available to the @entity260 terrorists in @entity21			0
but if theywere unleashed on a @entity207 shopping centre or at a crowded sporting event – the potential loss of life could be just as horrific			0

police given extra time to question one of the men , 43 , from @entity29
