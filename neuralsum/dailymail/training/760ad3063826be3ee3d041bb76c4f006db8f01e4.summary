by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 05:39 est , 29 december 2012 the compilation of the honours list has always been something of a murky affair			1
the perception lingers that a nudge here , a wink there and a generous donation to the right account does no harm at all to one 's prospects of a knighthood			1
trot along to one of the prime minister 's barbecues in @entity18 and the chances of the @entity20 pinning something on your lapel at @entity24 a few months later also appear to improve somewhat			1
civil servants , politicians and bankers pick up gongs for doing little more than their day job , while , according to a report earlier this year by the @entity33 public administration select committee , it still remains the case that not enough ' normal people ' are being recognised on the list			1
no sir @entity37 : double @entity39 gold medalist @entity38 will receive a cbe and not a knighthood but the relationship between sport and honours has always been more straightforward			1
it is essentially a ­ meritocracy , stripped of politicking and intrigue			0
if you win , you are rewarded			0
in fact , we do n't want our sports stars to be ' normal ' at all			1
the trouble this year is they were too extraordinary			1
the gold rush of a glorious @entity39 summer where @entity60 collected 29 gold medals led @entity62 to issue curmudgeonly briefings about how there would be an honours ' cutback ' even before another 34 golds at the @entity68			1
faced with the prospect of nearly half the audience at the @entity71 being called @entity72 or sir that , the prime minister called a halt			0
as a result there is no sir @entity37			0
no @entity79 of the @entity80 , either			0
in any other year , this illustrious trio would have been guaranteed the very highest accolades of the land for their inspirational performances			1
they not only succeeded in their chosen fields , their golden glow was reflected across the nation as they brought the country together for moments of collective joy and patriotism , the intensity of which has rarely been seen before			0
but on this occasion , they have had to drop down a rung or two , ' victims ' of our incredible sporting success , if we dare use such a word in this context			1
inconsistent : paralympian @entity105 is a dame but @entity106 is given a @entity107 instead of a knighthood when @entity109 took double gold on the track in @entity112 in 2004 , she was made a @entity113 without argument			1
when @entity38 achieved a similar feat in @entity116 this summer winning the 5,000m and 10,000m , he was handed a citation for a cbe instead			0
paralympian @entity105 is a @entity113 , but all - ­ conquering wheelchair athlete @entity106 is not named a knight , he has a cbe			0
there are only so many knights and dames a nation can accommodate , even on a special @entity39 honours list			1
but it is not a snub to miss out and it would churlish to regard it as such			2
murky affair : pop along to one of the @entity132 barbecues in @entity18 and your chances of getting a gong appear to improve some of the sports stars not being called to the @entity24 this year have long careers ahead and there is time enough for knighthoods , honours and accolades			1
what might seem like a contradiction now can surely be addressed in lists ahead			2
at least cycling has two knights of the road ; sir @entity150 for his pursuit of excellence with the @entity154 team and sir @entity155 , or sir @entity155 as he will surely be known , for his historic @entity157 triumph and @entity39 gold			1
there are two sirs on the waves as well , with @entity162 , performance director of @entity154 's rowing team and sailor @entity164 collecting knighthoods			2
but being a history - maker is not necessarily enough			0
when @entity168 finally landed @entity154 's first men 's @entity169 in 76 years at the @entity171 during an era when men 's tennis is as strong as it has ever been , he still admitted it ' would be a little rash ' to give him a knighthood			2
the committee agreed , handing him an obe			0
the idea that he has been denied , though , is preposterous			0
to make him sir @entity78 at 25 would be premature in the extreme			0
@entity183 , @entity154 's last great men 's tennis champion , was never given an honour			2
however it is certainly a far cry from the list of 2003 when @entity189 was given an obe just to ' add interest ' to the list			0
in truth , no athlete , sportsman or sportswoman competes with these ceremonial honours in mind			2
the distinction that truly counts is the medal hung around their neck on the podium or the trophy they receive at the climax to a tournament			0
sports stars receive honours enough , and most of them would happily cede their place on the list to a charity worker or a member of the @entity214 if that were the choice			1
but as a nation we enjoy having sporting heroes and it is a fine problem to have too many for once			0
who said the honours system was ever consistent , anyway ? want the proof ? some inherit a title because their father was made a @entity225 , like sir @entity226			2
and then there 's sir @entity228			2
missing out : tennis star @entity168 will not be knighted but will be awarded the obe instead			0

a trip to the @entity233 's barbecue also appears to improve your chances of a gong
the relationship between sport and honours is more straightforward
medals equal gongs but this year our sports stars were too extraordinary
but many gold winners fall ' victims ' to @entity60 's incredible @entity39 success
it is not a snub , many of those missing out have long careers ahead of them
