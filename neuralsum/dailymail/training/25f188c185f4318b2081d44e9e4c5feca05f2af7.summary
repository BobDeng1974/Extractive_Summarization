the new defence secretary personally overruled an ‘ outrageous and juvenile ’ attempt to make the @entity2 trail the colours of the @entity5 flag at the @entity6			1
@entity7 reacted with fury when told of the plan for the famous jet display team , part of @entity13 ’s @entity12 , to replace their traditional red , white and blue smoke with just white and blue , representing the @entity16			1
it would have been a highly political statement just weeks ahead of a referendum in @entity5 on whether the country should become independent , breaking up the 300 - year - old union with @entity22			2
however , in the event , the jets trailed their traditional three colours , representing the @entity44 , to huge cheers from the 40,000 - strong crowd inside @entity47 ’s @entity29			0
tv images of the flypast , and the warmth of the welcome extended by the @entity5 crowd to the @entity53 , were seen as a blow to nationalist first minister @entity56 ’s campaign to persuade @entity5 to back independence in the september 18 referendum			2
a senior government source revealed the request for the @entity2 to produce white and blue smoke was overruled at the last minute by mr @entity7 , appointed to lead the @entity62 in last week ’s wide - ranging government reshuffle			1
new defence secretary @entity7 blocked the attempt to paint the @entity16 in the sky over @entity47 ‘ @entity7 personally refused the request			2
they wanted white and blue , but the @entity2 are part of the @entity12 , keeping all of @entity13 safe			1
‘ the secretary of state was not about to let politics interfere with our @entity72 , ’ the source said			0
a defence source added : ‘ it ’s just bizarre			0
can you imagine @entity22 asking for just red and white for their events ? or @entity79 doing this same ? ‘ @entity2 have never flown with any other colours because they represent the @entity13			1
that ’s what they do			0
you can not request different colours			0
’ former @entity86 defence minister @entity85 said : ‘ frankly , this would have been both outrageous and juvenile			0
in their reaction to the @entity2 trailing red , white and blue , the @entity5 crowd gave a very clear answer to the people who wanted to play games with the @entity6			1
’ mr @entity56 promised not to play politics with the @entity6 , saying he would not use the event to push his campaign for @entity5 independence			2
however , opponents say he has already broken that pledge by predicting this week that @entity47 will vote yes in the referendum and become ‘ @entity102 ’			0
the first minister also used a press conference at the @entity6 ’ main media centre to attack @entity106 and suggest @entity5 sporting teams would ‘ flourish ’ after independence			1
mr @entity56 has been accused of hijacking major sporting events in the past – prompting fury when he unfurled a @entity5 flag behind the prime minister ’s head when @entity114 won @entity115 last year			2
mr @entity114 condemned the stunt , saying he ‘ did n’t like it ’			0
the @entity5 first minister also urged people to back ‘ @entity120 ’ , a term he personally coined instead of @entity122 to describe @entity5 ’s competitors at the @entity124			2
the aerobatic display team 's appearance in the skies over @entity47 was one of the highlights of the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2014 @entity6 crowds in the @entity132 outside the main arena captured their own photos of the smoke trails against the sunset @entity2 insiders insist they only ever use red , white and blue smoke , wherever they are booked to perform @entity6 organisers blamed a typing error in the guide which could not be corrected before it went to press in an initial statement , a spokesman for the @entity6 said that there had been no plan for the @entity2 to trail blue and white smoke , and the reference to such a flypast in the guide had been a typing error			1
‘ it was a mistake that was done in the editing			0
it was always the case that there would be the three colours , ’ the spokesman said			0
but later , the position changed			0
a spokesman said : ' @entity159 would like to clarify that it was its ceremony ’s producers who had initial conversations about @entity2 trailing blue and white smoke to represent the host nation ’s @entity16 , but this was never formally requested			1
' we were delighted with the participation of the @entity2 who deployed their standard trail of red , white and blue in the ceremony			1
' a source close to mr @entity56 insisted the first minister had not been aware of the request for blue and white smoke by the @entity6 organisers			1
a @entity177 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity177 made no such approach regarding the @entity2 whose flypast was a spectacular highlight of a fantastic opening ceremony			1
any claims to the contrary are completely untrue			0
‘ @entity47 2014 , as organisers of the @entity6 , independently contract a private company to organise and stage the opening and closing ceremonies			2
‘ an approach was made by them to the @entity62 to explore whether it would be possible to have blue and white smoke in recognition of @entity5 as the host @entity6 nation			1
we believe that ultimately the @entity195 did not want to proceed with this suggestion			0
’ @entity56 has been accused of abandoning his pledge not to use the 2014 games to score political points the opening and closing ceremonies of the @entity6 have been produced on behalf of the organisers by @entity203 - based brand agency @entity202 , which was also behind the @entity6 ceremonies in @entity205 in 2002 and @entity206 in 2006			0
it is understood the agency held informal discussions in february , and one insider suggested that initially no objections were raised to the idea of the @entity2 using white and blue smoke			1
a spokesman for the @entity213 campaign against @entity5 independence said : ‘ if there was any attempt by the nationalists to play politics like this with @entity47 's games it will be frowned upon by @entity5			0
‘ @entity2 are loved by people in @entity5 and right across the whole @entity13			1
' a spokesman for the @entity62 said : ‘ the @entity2 are ambassadors for the @entity13 and are famous for their red , white and blue smoke trails which represent the whole of the @entity13			1
‘ the flypast was to celebrate the @entity159 , the @entity6 and the presence of her majesty so it was fitting that red , white and blue were used			2
’ the most recent poll of polls suggests mr @entity56 ’s independence dream is likely to be crushed , indicating a 14 - point lead for the no campaign .			0

media guide said @entity2 would fly with only blue and white smoke
on the night they were seen with their traditional red , white and blue
raises question about whether it was hoped they would recreate the @entity16
organisers blame a typo , and @entity5 government denies asking for change
aerobatic display was one of the highlights of the opening ceremony
