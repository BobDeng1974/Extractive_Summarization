' every single movement i made , every gesture , every facial expression , was the focus of scrutiny and distracted from the evidence in the case			1
' @entity36 told the paper she had been portrayed during the first trial as ' the dark lady ... who decided @entity5 was better than me and had to die '			2
' projecting that image justifies in their minds that i would be capable of committing a crime so heinous as this and therefore validates the guilty verdict in the first trial , ' she said			0
but , she added , finance was also a problem : ' if it were possible to go to the court and not have to deal with the issues of being afraid of being thrown back in prison again for an arbitrary reason , or for being able to financially afford it , absolutely i would want to be there			0
' @entity15 's highest criminal court , the @entity83 , ruled in march that an appeal court in @entity33 must re-hear the case against @entity36 and @entity87 for the murder of 21 - year - old @entity5 , from @entity89			1

the @entity15 added that he feared his lover would succumb to the offer because she was ' out of control '			2
