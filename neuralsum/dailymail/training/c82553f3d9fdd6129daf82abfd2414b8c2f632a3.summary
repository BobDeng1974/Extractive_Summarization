by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 9 september 2013 you would n't expect to see your meal to come to you in a bowl like this - not until after you 'd eaten it , that is			0
but this is exactly the kind of experience that awaits diners at one of the many toilet - themed restaurants that are springing up across @entity13 in a craze for food that - hopefully - does n't taste as it looks			1
the latest loo eatery , which opened in @entity17 , @entity18 , at the end of august , serves up lavatorial delights such as brown , curly wisps of soft serve ice cream - as well as more standard noodle , meat and vegetable dishes			1
bog roll : diners can choose from a menu of lavatory - themed dishes all of them come in individual , toilet - like vessels , from bidets to potties to - in the case of the ice cream - little cups , where the plumbing at the back forms a dainty handle for diners to hold their end - of - meal digestif			2
the restuarant itself is equipped to resemble a bathroom , with showers attached to the walls and seats that look like toilet bowls topped with cushions in the shape of large piles of poo			0
toilet restaurants have become popular across @entity13 , with cities including @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 boasting their own loo chains , and others in @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity66 's version - @entity65 pian man wu , which translates as ' @entity67 full of poo ' - has an extensive menu covering dishes that also includes the apparently signature ' super constipation black dry s * * * ' ice cream , in this case topped with red beans and sprinkles in a mini squat toilet and coming at a price of @entity78 ( around Â£ 2.60 )			2
visitors may be surprised to find so may toilets in a restaurant , where many other eateries in @entity13 do not actually have their own toilet , and patrons are required to relieve themselves in public lavatories in the street outside			0
@entity88 decor : the walls are decorated to look like the inside of a bathroom groom of the stool : waiters serve patients at seats that are adorned with poo - shaped cushions toilet bowl : diners share food from dishes shaped like sinks , bidets and @entity104 seated toilets like the ones that feature in the dinnerwear at these establishments are also less common in @entity13 , as hygiene tends to dictate a preference for squatters			1
in @entity66 , a municipal law literally states that ' only two flies ' are allowed in a public toilet at any one time			2
yet @entity13 is no stranger to quirky themed restaurants - including those of a less lavatorial nature			0
@entity66 boasts a string of weird dining experiences that include a kung - fu themed restaurant , where waiters perform karate chops as they deliver dishes , a @entity128 restaurant , and an @entity130 schoolroom restaurant where entry is only on production of @entity133 that shows you would have been at school in the decade			1
outside of @entity137 , themed restaurants can be just as bizarre			0
the @entity139 restaurant recently opened in @entity140 , @entity141 , giving the chance to eat cakes that look like human organs and bandages on a dentist 's chair and be served by waiters in doctor and nurse uniforms - or opt to be tied in a straitjacket and have their meal spoonfed to them			0
@entity155 poo : the restaurant has shower heads and toilet rolls attached to the walls pots of potty : every detail is intended to be as authentic as possible , including flushes that actually push fine faeces : this diner appears impressed by the morsels on offer tastes as good as it looks : an ice cream desert at the restaurant in @entity17			1

toilet themed restaurant opens in @entity17 , @entity18
cities including @entity66 , @entity56 and @entity58 already have own versions of the loo cafe
diners served food in bidets and walls decorated with toilet rolls and shower heads
