@entity6 's chief executive @entity7 has warned @entity2 television is being bought wholesale by greedy @entity4 corporations in a swipe at @entity30 actor @entity29 , who gave the same lecture last year , he said : ' in recent years we 've seen a parade of @entity4 standing up here at the @entity22 telling us how things ought to be done			1
' but how do you explain the number of @entity4 entities queuing up to buy our producers and now our broadcasters ? ' does n't this suggest that maybe as with our gun laws and health system it 's us who are showing them how it ought to be done ? ' mr @entity7 said the @entity2 's public service broadcasters - the @entity48 , @entity13 , @entity6 and @entity49 - have ' created the best conditions for creative programme - making on the planet '			1
using the @entity48 's 1990 political thriller @entity54 – which has recently been remade by @entity29 – as an example , he said : ' would @entity19 , for example , have bought a show about a murderous politician who broke the fourth wall of drama if the @entity48 had n't taken that risky decision , decades before ?

' mr @entity7 warned that @entity4 companies such as @entity20 – which has started producing set - top boxes – may not have the interests of @entity2 viewers at heart			2
he said : ' what level of accountability and responsibility are we prepared to expect from platforms that operate across technical and geographical boundaries ?
