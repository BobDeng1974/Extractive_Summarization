@entity0 was quickly dragged down to earth after his memorable @entity3 comeback earlier this month – with a fine for failing to practise what he preaches at @entity7			1
the 36 - year - old @entity8 has taken on the role of first - team coach at the @entity13 & @entity12 club this season			1
a return to @entity16 in @entity17 – where he made his first international appearance since the @entity20 – was not about to stop him being on hand to shout orders to his players the next day			2
after a dash back from the @entity28 capital to @entity3 ’s @entity29 , @entity25 made it in time to oversee a resounding home win over @entity32			1
‘ i arrived just in time for the warm - up , ’ he said			1
‘ we got the coach back to @entity37 and i drove into the rugby club just as they were starting the warm - up			1
@entity0 , pictured during an @entity3 training session , is hoping to be involved against @entity41 the 36 - year - old has been gearing up for @entity3 's next @entity44 match against @entity41 ‘ i do n’t think they expected to see me , but the manager said it was a little bit of a lift for them for me to turn up			1
i was barking orders straight away ! they won 45 - 0			1
‘ i really enjoy it down there			2
it is a good group of lads and they are willing to learn			2
it reminds you of what rugby is all about			2
none of the players are paid , obviously			0
there is a club house and muddy pitches that you go and coach on , on a tuesday and thursday			0
you try and get the best out of them and we are enjoying a successful year			1
’ on @entity25 ’s watch , @entity7 are on a roll – currently top of their league table with 16 wins from 19 matches			1
but his positive impact did n’t stop him from facing the music , after his accidental obstruction had denied @entity3 a late try in @entity17			0
‘ i got fined , ’ he said			0
‘ we had a fining session last week and the 2nd - team coach said , “ everyone has been drilled to make sure they time their decoy runs right and make sure they ’re an option ”			1
obviously i got penalised for that for @entity89 ’s disallowed try in @entity17 , so i was up before the beak			0
’ @entity25 was part of the @entity3 side which lost 24 - 8 to @entity41 at the @entity92 back in march 2011 now that @entity25 has become the oldest try - scorer in @entity44 history and proved to himself that he can withstand the ferocity of @entity16 at the age of 36 , he has a score to settle in @entity99			1
four years ago , the @entity100 was the last @entity101 to lift the championship trophy – but it was a surreal ceremony in the lobby of a hotel , after @entity107 ’s team had been beaten 24 - 8 by @entity41 , to dash their @entity108 hopes			1
@entity25 is back in the @entity110 ranks and he is desperate for another shot at the title - chasing @entity112 on march 1			1
‘ hopefully , i will be involved against @entity41 because there are a few wrongs to put right after 2011 , ’ he said			1
‘ wig ( @entity117 , @entity3 forwards coach ) was around then , as well as a few other guys – @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122			0
it was a long time ago			0
the important thing this week is it will be a cracking game , with a big build - up , but we have two weeks ’ preparation			1
‘ back then – and i ’m not using this as an excuse – i think we played @entity129 the previous sunday and then had six days to prepare			0
we just did n’t do it in 2011			2
it was n’t because of the six - day turn - around , i think it 's because we forgot what it takes to get a result in tough places like that			2
‘ but this time we have two weeks to prepare , so we can get back up to the same level we were at going to @entity17			0
training will be pretty intense			0
’ @entity3 's @entity25 , pictured driving with the ball , has said he wants to put things right after previous defeat that intensity will suit @entity25 just fine			1
since his recall to the @entity3 squad last month , he has felt at home as the senior player			0
asked if he feels his body can cope with taking part in another @entity20 , he said : ‘ i ’m even more convinced now			2
i only played 10 minutes in @entity17 and 25 against @entity150			0
it is very different if you start a game , but i have no issues whatsoever			0
’ his try against @entity150 was his first for the national team since he touched down on november 15 , 2008 , against @entity157			0
‘ it was a long time ago , ’ he said			0
@entity25 has spoken of having ‘ unfinished business ’ in @entity160 rugby , but admitted that the satisfaction of returning to the @entity3 fold would be tempered by poor results			1
so far , however , he has played a cameo role in back - to - back wins			2
now he will prepare for the next trip to @entity99 , full of hope and expectation			0
‘ it is about winning , ’ he said			0
‘ there is no reason we should n’t if we get everything right , with the resources we have got and the players we have			0

@entity0 is hoping to be involved against @entity41 on march 1
the 36 - year - old was part of side which were beaten 24 - 8 in 2011
@entity25 *insists* he has a few ' wrongs ' which need to be put right after defeat
