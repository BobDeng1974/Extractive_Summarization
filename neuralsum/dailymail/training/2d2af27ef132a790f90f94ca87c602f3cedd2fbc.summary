by @entity0 published : 05:39 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 10 may 2012 it is a full two and a half centuries since the fourth @entity2 is said to have demanded his hunk of meat be brought to him between two doorstop wedges of bread so he need n't take a break from gambling			1
his accidental invention , reported to have been the result of his wish to avoid gravy dripping onto his hands , was purportedly picked up by his gambling pals - i 'll have the same as @entity17 ! ' - and the sandwich was born			1
the bread - based snack has since become one of @entity22 's most popular and enduring culinary creations , and forms the backbone of many a lunchbreak			2
celebrating the sandwich : @entity26 is marking 250 years of the nation 's favourite bread - based snack with a @entity30 pudding wrap thanks to its versatility , the potential permutations of the bread - based snack are endless			1
and this week , to celebrate 250 years of the sandwich , @entity26 has launched a new sandwich range , @entity44 , celebrating @entity22 's most iconic foods and paying homage to the sandwich , which the store says is ' one of @entity22 's most famous contributions to world cuisine			1
whether or not these combinations will elevate our global culinary status any higher is a matter of personal taste			2
the collection includes such delights as the @entity30 pudding wrap , complete with @entity22 topside beef , roast potato and horseradish sauce			1
thinking outside the ( lunch ) box : the @entity17 , 1718 - 1792 , is said to have invented the sandwich when he instructed his kitchen staff to bring him his meat between two slices of bread so he could continue gambling or another , perhaps best left to the iron - stomached : the scotch egg sandwich , stuffed with slices of haslet pork , free range egg and pickle			2
joining @entity26 on the jubilee bandwagon is @entity71 's , who plan to design a @entity22 - themed sandwich for every month of this anniversary year			1
an ardent gambler , the 4th @entity2 refused to break from his games to dine formally			2
instead , so legend has it , he demanded his kitchen staff bring him slabs of beef between hunks of bread , so that he might eat it without dripping gravy on his cards			2
his gambling chums , all eager to emulate their esteemed host , adopted the same habit , and when the @entity2 ordered his snack , they would shout ' the same as @entity17 ! ' , and thus , the story goes , the sandwich was born			0
a less colourful version of the tale is expounded in the @entity2 's biography , by @entity94			0
he suggests that @entity17 , a hardworking member of the military who was heavily involved with the political world and the arts , is more likely to have eaten the sandwiches at his desk			0
first up for may is their beef and @entity103 , which they say is made up of ' succulent beef , horseradish and caramelised red onion chutney with spinach on an oval bite , ' which roughly translates a beef sandwich on funny - shaped bread			0
@entity112 , @entity113 and marketing director at @entity115 , said : ' a good sandwich still gets our tastebuds excited and is more often than not the thing we turn to when in need of a satisfying snack			0
this this is why it has remained so important to our food culture for so many years			0
' as a business , we ’ve been baking bread since the 1930s when our founder @entity71 started to deliver bread to the people of @entity130			0
we know more than most about the importance of quality ingredients and how to make a great sandwich			0
@entity26 sandwich buyer @entity134 added : ' @entity22 has a fantastic culinary history that we wanted to celebrate with our greatest food creation of all - the humble sandwich			1
' we know that this summer there will be a big appetite for heritage foods and we wanted to celebrate some of these in a new and tasty way			0
' millions of people look forward to eating @entity30 pudding as part of their sunday roast			1
' now they ’ll be able to pick one up anytime they like in the form of a wrap			1
' @entity26 has become well known for its sandwich innovations			1
this new range follows the strawberry and cream sandwich , created last year to celebrate @entity157 fortnight , and the lasagna sandwich in 2010 .			0

@entity26 say the @entity30 pudding wrap is ' iconic '
