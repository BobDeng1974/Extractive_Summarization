struggling @entity0 ended a thoroughly miserable week with one tiny sliver of good news as referee @entity3 indicated that he would not officially record the @entity6 defender ’s red card against @entity7 , thereby sparing him a suspension from @entity6 ’s first @entity10 match of the season against @entity12			1
that said , on current form , manager @entity13 might not be inclined to select the @entity17 defender anyway			0
@entity0 was sent off for the second time in four days as a shadow @entity6 side took a heavy beating from @entity7 in @entity21 , the @entity17 ’s bad luck lingering on since his part in the team ’s @entity26 drubbing in @entity28 last midweek			1
too easy : @entity7 's @entity30 ( centre ) gave them the lead in an emphatic 6 - 1 win against @entity6 seeing red : @entity0 ( left ) was sent off for @entity6 for fouling @entity35 ( right ) swept home : @entity37 ( right ) scored @entity7 's third just before half - time in an emphatic win @entity6 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity0 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			1
subs : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			0
goal : @entity45 44 red card : @entity0 89 @entity7 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity37 , @entity30 , @entity68 , @entity69			1
subs : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity35			1
goals : @entity30 5 , @entity69 12 , @entity37 45 , @entity78 60 , @entity77 83 , @entity35 89 @entity0 ’s ordering off against @entity83 gave the @entity84 a platform on which to build their 4 - 1 first leg victory and , despite performing reasonably well for much of this match , he conceded the free - kick from which @entity77 scored @entity7 ’ fifth , conceded the penalty which made it 6 - 1 and was then sent packing for a foul on @entity35			1
assistant boss @entity96 , in charge as @entity13 drilled his players for the second leg against @entity83 back in @entity94 , remarked : ‘ i thought @entity97 was playing really well – it was a harsh sending off			0
i ’m not going to talk about the referee but if he ’s not including it in his report , that ’s good news			0
that ’s a relief for @entity97 and for us			0
’ while he may have dodged a bullet domestically – team - mate @entity105 missed the @entity107 opener in 2012 after referee @entity108 reported his red in a friendly against @entity111 to the @entity113 @entity112 – @entity0 will be missing as @entity13 ’s team attempt to recover from the 4 - 1 defeat suffered in @entity84 last midweek			1
in terms of preparing for that recovery mission at @entity119 , @entity6 needed this fixture like a hole in the head			2
the club may have banked a cheque for turning up but the no show of @entity13 and key men like @entity128 internationalist @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity130 would have left the organisers and much of the 14,000 crowd in the @entity133 feeling short - changed			2
on the ball : @entity62 ( centre ) started for @entity7 in their pre-season win against @entity6 @entity96 fielded what was essentially a development side with eight players aged 21 and under in the line - up and new @entity7 boss @entity140 admitted he expected more from @entity6 : ‘ i was hoping for a stronger test			1
' we brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game			0
it was n’t a waste of time , sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies			0
’ @entity96 countered by defending @entity6 ’s team selection : ‘ the bottom line is the game was arranged in february before we arrived			2
it ’s fallen between big @entity158 games so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team			0
‘ for our team full of under - 18s , it ’s a massive step up for them from the @entity167 youth league but they ’ll remember it , they ’ll watch these players on tv and be able to say they played against them			2
‘ obviously it ’s painful but i thought there were patches in the first half where we passed it and were brave on the ball			0
@entity47 in particular had a terrific game in there against quality players			0
’ raring : @entity68 ( left ) featured for @entity7 as he recovers from an injury - plagued season last term the margin of defeat may have been greater but there was less shame in this team of kids going down by a 6 - 1 scoreline than in the heavy beating endured by their senior counterparts in @entity84 last midweek			1
only @entity0 and local hero @entity49 survived from @entity6 ’s wipe - out in @entity28 and while the former ’s inclusion was a penance , the latter was handed the captain ’s armband for his homecoming			1
@entity49 scored for @entity204 against the @entity205 on his last appearance at the grand old venue that was constructed for the @entity208 and admitted he was more than happy to make the journey			2
‘ i really wanted to be here			0
to play in the @entity133 again was a nice thing to do			0
it is a big thing to be the captain of a team like @entity6 but i think it will be the last time			2
if you lose 6 - 1 that is not great			1
‘ wednesday will be hard but the whole team believes			0
we want to do it and we hope we can do it			0
’ getting stuck in : @entity30 ( centre ) gets tackled by @entity45 ( right ) during the @entity21 - based friendly @entity140 is getting to know his own players but possesses a strong pool that made practice inevitable for goalkeeper @entity41 , starting his third saturday friendly in a row as he continues to ease himself towards match fitness			1
the former @entity230 man was soundly beaten after five minutes when @entity30 slammed home @entity68 ’s cut - back for the first goal and was again let down by his defence when @entity69 scored the second on the rebound after he ’d made the initial save			1
@entity45 claimed one back for @entity6 as his header from @entity239 ’s cross crept over the line but an agitated @entity7 responded swiftly as @entity37 restored the two - goal gap on the stroke of half - time			1
maestro : @entity77 came on as a second - half for @entity7 and scored a delightful free - kick @entity7 substitute @entity78 added the fourth via a deflection off @entity248			1
@entity77 ’s free - kick , a whipped 20 - yard effort that left @entity41 flailing at fresh air , was the pick of the bunch and although the decision to punish @entity0 seemed harsh as @entity255 stumbled near the byline there was no denying the conviction of @entity35 ’s spot - kick as it rattled in off the post to complete the scoring			1
@entity49 expressed sympathy with @entity0 after @entity263 produced the second yellow following a tussle with @entity35			2
‘ i feel for @entity97			0
i think it was a stupid decision from the referee			0
why would he give a card in a friendly ? ’ everone in attendance might equally have queried just why @entity6 were here at all .			2

@entity7 thrash @entity6 6 - 1 in their pre-season friendly
@entity30 , @entity69 , @entity37 , @entity273 , @entity77 and @entity35 all on target
@entity45 scored @entity6 's *consolation* who had @entity0 sent off
