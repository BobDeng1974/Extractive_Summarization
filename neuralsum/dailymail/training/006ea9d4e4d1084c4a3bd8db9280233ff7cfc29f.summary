by @entity1 reporter published : 19:39 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 21:02 est , 14 january 2013 drink a lot : researchers found that nations which consume a lot of milk and milk products also tend to have more @entity9 laureates among their populations countries that drink a lot of milk also win a lot of @entity9 prizes , reveals a new study			1
researchers found nations that consume a lot of milk and milk products also tend to have a lot of @entity9 laureates among their populations			1
research published last year in the @entity23 reported a strong association between a nation ’s chocolate consumption and @entity9 laureate prowess , speculating that the flavonoid content of chocolate was behind the boost in brain power			2
this got the letter authors thinking			0
as chocolate is often combined with milk , could it be the amount of milk or milk products consumed per head that fuels @entity9 success ? they looked at the 2007 data from the @entity43 on per capita milk consumption in 22 countries as well as the information provided by the author of the chocolate theory , and found a significant association			1
@entity50 has the most @entity9 laureates per 10 million of its population			1
although , it hosts the @entity55 - which some might argue could introduce an element of bias - it also consumes the most milk per head of the population , getting through 340 kilos ( 750lb ) every year			0
and @entity61 , which knocks back 300 kilos ( 660lb ) of the white stuff every year , has a @entity9 haul of similar proportions			0
boasts brains : @entity61 , which consumes 660lbs of milk per head a year boasts 32 @entity9 laureates conclusion : to improve your chances of winning @entity9 prizes , the report recommended you eat more chocolate as well as drink milk however , at the other end of the scale , @entity74 has the lowest number of @entity9 laureates in its population			1
but it also has the lowest milk consumption of the countries studied , at around 25 kilos ( 55lb ) a year			1
however , the researchers noted there does seem to be a ceiling effect with no discernible impact beyond an annual per capita consumption of 350 kilos ( 771lb ) , as @entity89 ’s @entity9 haul seems to attest			2
they queried if milk consumption was simply a reflection of a strong educational system			2
but there is a plausible biological explanation for the link as milk is rich in vitamin d , and this may boost brain power , the evidence suggests			0
the report concluded : ' so to improve your chances of winning @entity9 prizes you should not only eat more chocolate but perhaps drink milk too or strive for synergy with hot chocolate			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity110 .			0
