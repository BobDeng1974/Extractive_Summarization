@entity5 made a long term investment in 1989 when he snapped up a lifetime , first class travel ticket for any global route from @entity10 for almost $ 500,000			1
and the @entity12 air traveller has racked up a record amount of mileage for the two decades since thanks to his supposedly ' unlimited ' air pass for himself and any companion			1
grounded : @entity5 has been denied his @entity10 unlimited pass after over 23 years but after amassing enough air miles to circumnavigate the world 1,600 times , mr @entity5 has now been grounded - after @entity10 accused him of selling his companion tickets			1
mr @entity5 , 67 , paid around $ 350,000 plus interest for the ticket 23 years ago , and at times travelled the world four times a week as he cashed in on his investment			1
he would regularly take friends and family on worldwide trips as his ' companion ' , and even helped fly home @entity35 victims to see their families thanks to his extra seat			0
mr @entity5 bought the @entity38 in 1989 while working as a consultant for mail order catalogues			1
he already travelled alot by plane on business and bought the pass after hearing about it from a friend			0
mr @entity5 estimates that there are only around 40 people in the world who currently own the @entity38 , which the airline stopped selling in 2004			1
premium access : mr @entity5 's pass allowed him first class travel with @entity10 on any global route @entity10 removed mr @entity55 after making an accusation of fraud against the frequent flyer when @entity10 calculated , however , that the @entity38 used by mr @entity5 and other frequent flyers was costing the airline around $ 1m a year , they grounded him over accusations of ' improper activity '			1
@entity5 's 23 years as a holder of the @entity38 allowed him to make dozens of seemingly unnecessary journeys , all without spending a dime			1
one flight saw him travel from the @entity68 all the way to @entity70 just so he could visit a @entity72 cosmetics store on the @entity73			0
he also flew to @entity74 to pick up his father - in - law so he could babysit for @entity5 's children , explaining to a bemused passenger that it was ' cheaper than paying a local teenager '			2
when his son was in college mr @entity5 would regularly fly to @entity82 every saturday to watch him play football			2
other regular journeys saw him fly to @entity85 , @entity86 with a sheet of raw silver , where he would visit his favourite craftsmen and return with a bag full of newly - made belt buckles			0
the incident in 2009 has bought to a halt years of air travel which mr @entity5 said was ' like a 9 to 5 job '			2
mr @entity5 's staggering airmiles make @entity97 's , who clocks up a meagre 10 million miles in @entity98 , look like a part - time flyer			2
mr @entity5 travelled around the @entity68 , as well as @entity100 and other parts of the world , often staying at his destination for just a few hours before flying back again without spending anything			1
he told @entity105 that during one flight he travelled to @entity107 just to pick up some exhaust pipes for a motorcycle			0

his travel adventures have since ground to a halt following a flight back from @entity70 , where he had used his companion pass to fly his daughter 's friend back to the @entity68 an @entity10 spokesperson said they still offer the lifetime pass , but have removed mr @entity55 as they ' had issues ' with him			1
a spokesperson said : ' our aairpass program , including unrestricted , fixed - rate air travel to both domestic and international markets , is expected to remain unchanged			0
' small fry : @entity97 's character in @entity98 clocks up a mere 10 million air miles - not a patch on mr @entity5 's 38 million ' in addition , all @entity133 privileges , including complimentary @entity135 membership , @entity137 privileges , companion travel benefits and aadvantage mileage accrual are expected to remain intact during the chapter 11 process			0
