genius : @entity1 , who certainly earned his stripes in the scientific world for the first time experimental evidence has been put forward confirming great @entity7 mathematician @entity1 ’s theory of how biological patterns such as tiger stripes or leopard spots are formed			1
@entity1 , whose centenary falls this year , put forward the idea that regular repeating patterns in animals are generated by a pair of morphogens that work together as an ‘ activator ’ and ‘ inhibitor ’			1
now researchers from @entity20 in @entity21 have validated the famous code - breaker ’s 60 - year - old theory in tests that also advance regenerative medicine			1
to test the theory the researchers studied the development of the regularly spaced ridges found in the roof of the mouth in mice			2
carrying out experiments in mouse embryos , the team identified the pair of morphogens working together to influence where each ridge will be formed			0
these chemicals controlled each other ’s expression , activating and inhibiting production and therefore controlling the generation of the ridge pattern			0
the researchers were able to identify the specific morphogens involved in this process – @entity47 or @entity47 , and @entity48 , which stands for @entity48 – so - called because laboratory fruit flies lacking the fly version have extra bristles on their bodies			0
@entity53 's amazing : tigers have stripes because of the behaviour of specific morphogens @entity1 was one of the great unsung heroes of @entity59 he broke the @entity62 military 's secret codes - created using the famous enigma machine - that helped @entity64 stay one step ahead of @entity66 , allowing the @entity67 to defeat his u-boats and win the @entity69			1
@entity1 's work even laid the foundation for the creation of modern computers , leading @entity74 to name him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century			1
' everyone who taps at a keyboard , opening a spreadsheet or a wordprocessing program , is working on an incarnation of a turing machine , ' it said			0
but @entity1 was shamefully ignored by the @entity83 , and then killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of being a homosexual and forced to undergo hormone therapy			2
they showed that when these morphogens ’ activity is increased or decreased , the pattern of the ridges in the mouth palate are affected in ways predicted by @entity1 ’s equations			2
for the first time the actual morphogens involved in this process have been identified and the team were able to see exactly the effects predicted by @entity1 ’s 60 - year - old speculative theory			1
dr @entity100 from the @entity101 at @entity102 said : ‘ regularly spaced structures , from vertebrae and hair follicles to the stripes on a tiger or zebrafish , are a fundamental motif in biology			0
t ' there are several theories about how patterns in nature are formed , but until now there was only circumstantial evidence for @entity1 ’s mechanism			2
our study provides the first experimental identification of an activator - inhibitor system at work in the generation of stripes – in this case , in the ridges of the mouth palate			0
‘ although important in feeling and tasting food , ridges in the mouth are not of great medical significance			0
however , they have proven extremely valuable here in validating an old theory of the activator - inhibitor model first put forward by @entity1 in the 50s			1
‘ not only does this show us how patterns such as stripes are formed , but it provides confidence that these morphogens ( chemicals ) can be used in future regenerative medicine to regenerate structure and pattern when differentiating stem cells into other tissues			0
‘ as this year marks @entity1 ’s centenary , it is a fitting tribute to this great mathematician and computer scientist that we should now be able to prove that his theory was right all along ! ’ results of the study were published this week in @entity158 .			1

@entity1 's 60 - year - old theory is validated
