he criticised the firm for curating apps using algorithms , and instead believes they should be handpicked by a small group of technology writers			2
in an open letter to chief executive @entity10 ( pictured ) , former president of @entity3 's product division , @entity13 - @entity12 , called the store an ‘ impenetrable jungle ’			1
he criticised the firm for curating apps using algorithms , and instead believes they should be handpicked by a small group of technology writers apps are currently curated using algorithms , although a selection are handpicked each week as part of @entity33 's picks			1
to be accepted onto the @entity6 , apps must be functional in that they must not crash , include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised			0
they must also have a user function and developers ca n't charge for app that does n't do anything			0
apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users			2
apps containing pornographic material , defined by @entity52 as ' explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings ' , will be rejected			0
as of june 2014 , there have been 75 billion app downloads since the store launched in 1998			0
@entity61 claimed that getting humans to choose which apps make it onto the store will make the site more ‘ intelligible ’ , and make @entity66 users happier			1
he added that he is so convinced his idea will work , he has even offered to make the changes himself , for free			1
‘ instead of using algorithms to sort and promote the apps that you permit on your shelves , why not assign a small group of adepts to create and shepherd an app store guide , with sections such as @entity80 , and so on , ’ wrote mr @entity71			1
‘ within each section , this team of respected critics will review the best - in - class apps			1
‘ moreover , they ’ll offer seasoned opinions on must - have features , tips and tricks			2
’ @entity12 added that a weekly newsletter could be used to identify new titles , respond to counter-opinions , present a developer profile , footnote any mistakes , and so on			2
this is the second time @entity61 has offered to redesign the @entity6			0
during a lobby conversation at the @entity99 in 2011 , mr @entity97 said he ’d be happy to make these changes without payment			0
mr @entity71 added he is so convinced his idea will work , he has even offered to make the changes himself , for free			1
this is the second time @entity61 has offered to redesign the @entity6 ( selection of apps pictured )			0
he originally offered his services during a lobby conversation at the @entity99 conference in 2011 @entity71 ( pictured ) joined @entity3 @entity110 in 1981 before moving to @entity111 in 1985 , where he became president of the @entity114 but ‘ the ever - hovering @entity117 ’ was said to have given him ‘ the evil eye and that was the end of the exchange			1
’ @entity71 joined @entity3 @entity110 in 1981 before moving to its @entity111 headquarters in 1985 , where he became president of the @entity114			1
he is a mathematics and physics graduate from @entity121 and currently works at the venture capital firm @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			0
however , he did state that even though he would do his work for free , @entity3 would still need to pay the writers and for the infrastructure			2
' as an independent publication - or , more likely , an app - an app store guide is n’t financially viable			0
' we know it ’s next to impossible to entice people to pay for information and i have no appetite for becoming a nano - pennies - per - pageview netwalker			0
' so , the @entity131 must be an @entity3 publication , a part of its ecosystem			0
' ‘ as @entity3 has shown time and again , it ’s the product that counts , concluded mr @entity71			1
‘ if you see the wisdom of a human - curated @entity145 , and i hope you do , i will not seek credit			2
