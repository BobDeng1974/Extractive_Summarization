a revealing new map has made it clear where hundreds of hate groups are based in the @entity4 , showing how racist and radical groups are still largely found in the @entity6 but the number of groups has multiplied dramatically since president @entity10 too office			1
the @entity11 has released a ' hate map ' last week which shows the national distribution of the various groups that they could confirm			2
the overall number of groups actually dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013 - the last full year with available data - but one of their more troubling observations is that some of the far - right leaning groups have had their ideologies picked up by conservative @entity25 politicians			1
@entity26 has the most hate groups with 77 in the state but the majority is still largely found in the southeast of the country growing trend : the number of hate groups jumps during @entity36 administrations but particularly during that of president @entity10 ‘ the idea that the @entity42 has infiltrated the @entity43 and the @entity44 , among others , is being plugged by @entity4 rep. @entity46 ( @entity47 )			1
last november , @entity4 rep. @entity39 ( @entity40 ) suggested the president was using the @entity48 as cover to set up a “ secret security force , ” ’ the report states			0
‘ earlier in 2013 , @entity4 rep. @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , echoing many @entity54 groups , falsely claimed that a proposed @entity60 arms treaty “ set the stage for [ gun ] confiscation on a global scale			2
” ’ the @entity11 , which focuses much of its work combating racist groups , said that the lack of clear legislative victories for the @entity10 administration on gun control in the wake of @entity68 and the upcoming immigration reform battle appear to have effectively calmed some of the far - right groups			2
‘ those factors , along with the collapse or near - collapse of several major groups for a variety of reasons , seem to have taken some of the wind out of the sails of the radical right , leaving the movement both weaker and somewhat smaller , ’ the report states			0
many states have varying bands of hate groups , but for their map , the @entity11 qualified them into eight categories : black separatist , neo-confederate , @entity91 identity , racist skinhead , white nationalist , @entity94 , @entity95 and general hate			1
there is only one state - @entity98 - that has no known hate groups but a vast majority of the rest can be found below the @entity103 line			1
the 11 states that make up the area between @entity106 and the @entity107 are home to 589 of the 939 active groups that the @entity11 identified - a whopping nearly 63 per cent			1
though @entity112 hosts 58 groups and @entity106 has 57 , they do not take the top slot this year			1
@entity26 actually made the top of the list , which comes as a bit of a surprise given the large immigrant population in the state and the fact that unlike the @entity6 , it does not have a history of slavery			2
face of the uprising : members of the @entity127 are seen at a rally near @entity129 , and like many far right groups , they are campaigning against immigration dropping slightly : the number of groups in the @entity4 dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013 the @entity26 - based @entity134 that was originally founded by racist skinheads group in @entity26 is one of the top two groups that the @entity11 have flagged up as particularly threatening			1
they have stepped up their rhetoric against immigrants and in support of ' the interests of white @entity4 '			0
' they have for years , been running in political elections and have n't done all that well			0
they have however , recently gathered the top influential white supremacists to run their board and are becoming more aggressive about winning elections , ' the report 's author @entity146 told @entity152			0
the other group that has been cited as a cause for concern is crew 41 which started online			0
they take aim at sex offenders and members of a @entity161 outpost allegedly shot and stabbed a middle aged couple after finding out that the husband was a registered sex offender			0
the trail of hate then returns to the south with @entity167 , which has 50 known groups			2
from there the next portion of the list is found in the @entity172 , with 44 groups in @entity174 , 42 in @entity175 and 41 in @entity176			0
the geographic composition of the map also shows how the groups tend to be found in or around cities			0
for instance , all but nine of @entity175 ’s 42 hate groups are found in and around @entity175			1
mr @entity146 , said that the ideas behind the group also plays a role in their location			0
' another thing to consider when analyzing this data is that certain hate groups reside in particular areas			1
the @entity95 will almost always be in rural areas whereas , the @entity193 are mostly in the cities , ' mr @entity146 told @entity152 .			0

number of hate groups jumped dramatically since president @entity10 took office but this year marks a slight drop from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013
@entity26 has the most with 77 groups followed by @entity112 with 58 and @entity106 with 57
@entity98 is the only state without a single known hate group
