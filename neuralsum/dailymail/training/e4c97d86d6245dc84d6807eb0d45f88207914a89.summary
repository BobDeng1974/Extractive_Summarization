@entity2 soldiers injured on the battlefield could soon be put into ' hibernation ' until they can be moved to safety , it has been revealed			1
the @entity7 @entity6 ( @entity8 ) is providing $ 550,000 to fund a radical new drug being developed by @entity11 scientists			1
it can put people into a ' survival window ' low enough to reduce blood loss , but high enough to prevent brain injury			1
the @entity8 plans to use the drug to put injured soldiers into a ' survival window ' low enough to reduce blood loss , but high enough to prevent brain injury			1
the @entity20 team is developing a two - stage treatment			1
the first shot will rescue the casualty during the first few minutes of severe haemorrhage and head trauma			0
the second shot is designed to stabilise them for longer periods ahead of evacuation			0
experts say the drug therapy they 're working on may be the first big advance in treating battlefield casualties since the @entity34			1
professor @entity35 and research associate @entity36 from @entity20 's @entity37 and @entity38 have spend seven years developing the technique			1
the treatment targets what battlefield surgeons call the ' platinum ten minutes ' after a soldier is wounded			0
he said the better known ' golden hour ' is a meaningless concept in far - forward military environments			0
' during the fighting in @entity51 and @entity52 , more than 87 percent of all deaths among allied soldiers occurred in the first 30 minutes , before they could get to a hospital			0
' nearly a quarter of these , almost a thousand people , were classified as having potentially survivable wounds			0
@entity59 was the killer , ' he said			0
' the problem is , after a soldier suffers catastrophic blood loss and brain injury , what is a good treatment for the body is not good for the brain and vice versa , ' said dr @entity35			1
' if you aim for too high a blood pressure , the casualty will bleed to death , and if you aim too low the brain will be irreversibly damaged			1
' it 's a double - edged sword			0
' but if we can dial in the right blood pressure it will be a world first and has the potential to save many lives on the battlefield			1
' the @entity20 team is developing a two - stage treatment			2
the treatment targets what battlefield surgeons call the ' platinum ten minutes ' after a soldier is wounded , and aims to keep them alive until they can be evacuated via helicopter			2
the first shot will rescue the casualty during the first few minutes of severe haemorrhage and head trauma			0
the second shot is designed to stabilise them for longer periods ahead of evacuation			0
' the fluid can be administered quickly into the blood or bone marrow and it also reduces inflammation , coagulopathy ( the bloods inability to clot ) and whole body energy consumption , ' dr @entity35 said			2
dr @entity35 said @entity8 became involved because of the progress the @entity20 team had made over seven years developing the process			2
' @entity8 chooses projects that can be rapidly advanced into the field			0
we will also start talks on the regulatory process – including clinical trials leading to @entity112 approvals – within a year			2
' @entity35 says the benefits wo n't be limited to @entity114 and commandos , but will automatically flow through to other western @entity2 units because of the close contact and co-operation between the organisations			2
the treatment could also be used to save lives away from the battlefield			0
because the extreme environments in which @entity2 soldiers operate share many similarities with tropical , rural and remote environments , the @entity20 work has relevance to pre-hospital medicine and aeromedical transport in many regions around the world .			1

@entity2 working with @entity20 in @entity11
drug aims to raise the heart and blood pressure into a ' survival window ' low enough to reduce blood loss , but high enough to prevent brain injury
human trials *expected* to begin within a year
