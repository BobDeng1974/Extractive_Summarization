former @entity1 boss @entity0 , pictured outside court yesterday , has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against @entity5 former @entity1 boss @entity0 has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against @entity5 after the @entity6 refused to block his claim for damages over ' sex orgy ' pictures			1
@entity0 , 74 , is seeking damages from @entity5 @entity12 and parent company @entity5 , and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine			1
he has brought a claim against @entity18 - based @entity5 and @entity5 @entity12 under the @entity19 and against @entity5 for misuse of private information			1
@entity5 's lawyers said that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out			1
they also argued that permission to serve the claim on @entity5 outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside			2
but mr @entity30 said today that the claim brought against @entity18 - based @entity5 under the @entity19 should continue			1
he said : ' on the contrary , it seems to me to be a viable claim which raises questions of general public interest which ought to proceed to trial			0
' the litigation follows @entity0 's 2008 privacy victory against the now - defunct @entity42 newspaper when he won £ 60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a ' sick @entity46 orgy ' with five prostitutes			1
@entity0 , the son of the 1930s @entity49 leader sir @entity48 , did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented @entity53 basement flat , but said it was consensual and private , with no @entity46 overtones			2
he said that his life had been devastated by the march 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly - filmed footage on its website , which attracted at least 3.5 million hits			0
@entity0 has campaigned for privacy ever since his unusual sexual tastes were exposed , backing pressure group hacked @entity64 and giving evidence in the @entity66			2
he has also been successful in legal bids to stop @entity5 from directing users to images of the orgy via the @entity72 and @entity73 courts			2
today he ruled there is jurisdiction for @entity0 ’s claim and ordered the case to go to trial at @entity84 ’s @entity6			1
after the hearing , mr @entity0 said : ' i am very pleased with the result			2
' what is important is that they are now going to have to come in front of the courts in the @entity12 , where they do an enormous amount of business , to seek to justify their conduct			2
' the only thing i regret is that it was necessary to have a hearing in the @entity6 in order to get them to do this			0
' @entity0 , 74 , is seeking damages from @entity5 ( pictured ) and parent company @entity5 , and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine speaking today , the judge said : ‘ a judicial remedy is available			1
the claimant clearly has a legal benefit which the court may grant and what the claimant requires amounts to general monitoring			0
‘ existing technology permits @entity5 to block images as it does with views of child pornography			2
‘ the claimant has a viable case and it seems to me to be a claim of viable public interest which ought to proceed to trial			0
’ @entity5 fiercely contest @entity0 ’s claims , believing any form of filter on searches could amount to censorship of the web			1
analysing the role of internet search engines , mr @entity30 said ‘ about 60 trillion ’ web pages are posted onto the internet each year			0
the judge , sitting at the @entity6 in @entity84 ( pictured ) , said that @entity0 ' plainly has a legal remedy , which the court may grant '			1
he added : ‘ a person searching for an image will click on a thumbnail of the image			0
a smaller version of the image on the website will be seen and stored inside a cache			0
‘ all this is done automatically			0
@entity5 has no control over this , when a user types in searches thumbnails will be displaying they see then come into view			0
the order is established by an algorithm			0
’ around 435,000 people viewed the photos and around 1.5 million had seen the video footage immediately after publication , the court heard earlier			0
the judge , who was told that @entity0 ’s action against @entity5 @entity12 under the @entity19 had been discontinued , went on to stay @entity0 's damages claim against @entity5 for misuse of private information , which he had described as ' deeply problematic '			1
the remaining action concerns @entity0 's bid to obtain an order requiring the search engine to cease processing the images			1
@entity5 's counsel , @entity171 , said that it had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific urls had been provided because , whatever the strict legal position , it had some sympathy for @entity0 and wished to avoid a dispute			1
but , @entity0 's counsel , @entity179 , said he had been forced to engage in what a @entity181 court had described as an ' endless game of ' whack - a - mole ''			1
this was despite the fact that it was possible - as @entity5 now accepted - for the search engine to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by @entity190 in the first place			0
the judge said that @entity0 ' plainly has a legal remedy , which the court may grant '			0

@entity0 , 74 , is seeking damages and an injunction over the photographs
he alleges @entity5 @entity12 and @entity5 *breached* the @entity19
today @entity6 refused to block former @entity1 boss 's claim
action follows @entity0 's 2008 privacy victory against @entity42
he won £ 60,000 in compensation over report that he took part in sex party
