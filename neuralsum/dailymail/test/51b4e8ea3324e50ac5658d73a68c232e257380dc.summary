a couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life - saving lung transplant			1
@entity7 , 24 , was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in september 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs			1
as her health continues to decline , her husband @entity14 , 23 , who has already received new lungs , is pleading for help			1
her insurance company , @entity17 , will not pay for the out - of - state treatment she needs at the @entity19 , he says			1
@entity14 pleaded : ' they are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign			1
i can not lose her			0
this ca n’t be the end of our love story			1
' we are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help			0
please help me save my wife @entity35			1
in december 2014 , @entity35 was discharged from the @entity61 hospital after a long stay and returned to @entity63 , but began having trouble breathing three days later			2
the hospital would not admit her because @entity67 would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum , the couple says			0
she will not be covered for the expensive out - of - state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital			1
she was admitted into @entity72 , but it however , does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that @entity35 has			2
' sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore			0
@entity17 is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to @entity19 being ' out of network ' , ' @entity14 wrote on the couple 's @entity82			2
' after explaining to @entity17 and @entity61 that there are only two places in the country , who would operate , due to ( the bacteria ) @entity89 , ( @entity19 and @entity90 ) still refused to work together to help her			0
' she is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the @entity72			0
' @entity14 said : ' they are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign			1
i can not lose her			0
this ca n’t be the end of our love story ' only three months away from their four - year anniversary , the couple has not been together since november 2014 when @entity14 received new lungs , and hope they can be together to celebrate @entity35 said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to @entity61 are at a standstill and that something needs to be done			1
' it needs to happen soon			0
nervous they are n't going to accept my case and that i 'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital , ' she wrote on the couple 's @entity118 page			0
in february , dr. @entity120 who is @entity35 's pulmonologist at the @entity72 , wrote a letter to @entity17 seeking for them to make an exception and pay for @entity35 's care in @entity61 , according to @entity126			2
but @entity17 denied the proposal saying @entity19 declined to enroll as a @entity17 provider			0
' @entity17 policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out - of - state providers in such situations , ' @entity129 , spokeswoman for the @entity130 wrote in a statement to @entity126			1
' @entity19 reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a @entity17 provider , the @entity136 ... will be happy to expedite their application			0
' however , the hospital claims that @entity17 told them if they wanted to treat @entity35 , they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept @entity17 patients			1
' @entity19 wants to help @entity35 , and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen ... it is up to @entity17 to address this situation , ' wrote spokeswoman @entity151			2
so far , the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch @entity19 said they are want to help @entity35 but said it is up to @entity17 to address the situation while @entity35 seems to be caught in limbo , the director of the media relations group at the @entity162 said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency			2
only three months away from their four year anniversary in july , the couple have not been together since november 2014 when @entity14 received his lung transplant at @entity19			1
even though he also had @entity89 like @entity35 , which makes lung transplants more complicated , his has been a success			2
however , he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection			1
so far , they rely on communication through their phones or computers			0
but all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together			0
' i just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in july and be able to hold hands and just hug , ' @entity35 told @entity126			2
' that 's all i really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary			0
' so far , the couple 's @entity197 page has raised $ 43,425 in donations out of its goal of $ 50,000 .			0

@entity35 and @entity37 , 24 and 23 , met in 2009 and married two years later
they both suffer from cystic fibrosis , and in november 2014 , @entity14 received new lungs
@entity35 is still waiting for a lung transplant because insurance company will not pay for the out - of - state treatment she needs , husband says

' they are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign . i can not lose her . this ca n’t be the end of our love story , ' @entity14 pleaded
