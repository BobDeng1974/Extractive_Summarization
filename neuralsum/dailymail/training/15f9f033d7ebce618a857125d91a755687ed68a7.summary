an ex-staffer for @entity2 rep. @entity2 is suing the married congressman 's office for wrongful termination , court documents discovered today reveal			1
the plaintiff in the case , @entity2 's former communications director , @entity6 , alleges that the congressman and his chief of staff engaged in ' hostile conduct ' toward her and that @entity2 sexually harassed her on multiple occasions			1
she also claims in the lawsuit that the @entity15 lawmaker ' regularly drank to excess ' and had ' a tendency to flirt ' at @entity18 functions with women who were not his wife			2
on one occasion the congressman allegedly told his aides that a ' female lobbyist had propositioned him for a " threesome			0
" ' on another , @entity26 says he told her that he and his ' estranged ' wife @entity28 had not had sex in years			0
@entity2 rep. @entity2 is pictured here with his wife @entity28 and his children @entity32 and @entity34			0
a former staffer of @entity2 is taking him to court over claims that he sexually harassed her and fired her without just cause @entity2 's former communications director , @entity6 , alleges in her lawsuit that the @entity15 lawmaker ' regularly drank to excess ' and had ' a tendency to flirt ' at @entity18 functions with women who were not his wife @entity26 also claims that after the chief of staff complained that her shirt was ' transparent ' and he could see her nipples , @entity2 told his personal assistant that as far as he was concerned , @entity26 ' could show her nipples whenever she wanted to			1
' the court filing , first uncovered by the @entity48 , was submitted to the @entity49 of the @entity50 on friday and charges that @entity2 's office violated the @entity52 when it fired @entity26 in july			1
according to the court documents , @entity26 began working in @entity2 's office in february 2013 as the new media director			1
the following january she was promoted to communications director after the congressman 's previous spokesperson gave notice			2
a review of her pay stubs on congressional database @entity63 confirms that much			0
on what was to be her first day in the new position , however , @entity26 claims she was informed by the chief of staff in the office , @entity71 , that she would have to interview for the job and that he was also speaking with other candidates			0
he ended up formally offering her the position the next day , but @entity26 says he made her ' professional life unbearable ' and five months later she was fired after making her concerns about @entity71 's behavior known to the congressman			1
while the court filing names the ' hostile work environment ' that both @entity2 and @entity71 allegedly created as the reason for the lawsuit , it specifies that ' gender discrimination ' was the reason for @entity26 's mistreatment			1
according to the former aide , several weeks before her promotion , she told @entity2 's executive assistant @entity91 that the congressman ' was awkward toward her at work and regularly seemed to try to avoid interacting with her			1
' wilkes in turn shared that the congressman and father of two ' had admitted to being attracted ' to @entity26 and having ' sexual fantasies ' and ' wet dreams ' about her			1
' @entity2 knew that @entity101 and @entity102 were friends and confidantes and that @entity101 would likely convey his comments to @entity102 , which is exactly what happened on this and other occasions , ' the lawsuit contends			2
after finding out the sexual fantasies , @entity26 said she was ' anxious ' to avoid one - on - one meetings with the congressman , and he seemed to avoid her , too , making it difficult to her do her job			1
yet the court documents also claim that the congressman ' regularly ' made comments toward @entity119 that were meant to determine her interest in a ' sexual relationship			2
' one time ' @entity2 told @entity26 that she had something on her skirt and that he hoped his comment would n’t be taken for sexual harassment , ' the document says			2
' a reasonable person would infer that @entity2 was joking that she had semen on her skirt , ' it goes on to say			0
another time @entity26 says the congressman told her that her skirt was partly unzipped			0
upon inspecting her skit in the bathroom ' she realized that the opening was so small that @entity2 would have had to be staring at her closely to notice			0
' after word got out on tuesday about @entity26 's lawsuit against her former employer , she deleted her twitter account - but not before @entity141 took a screenshot of it no stranger to controversy : this 2009 photo of @entity2 posing with a model , taken at a @entity15 night club , caused a stir on the eve of his election in 2010			1
he still beat his @entity152 opponent , though , and has cruised to reelection ever since the lawsuit indicates that it was the chief of staff 's terse relationship with @entity26 that ultimately led to her firing , not the congressman 's unwanted advances			0
the filing lists numerous ways in which the chief of staff undercut her , including publicly humiliating her at staff meetings and ' blaming her for errors and failings committed by others			0
' she eventually set up a meeting with @entity2 at which point she alerted him that the chief of staff was ' bullying her and treating her in a very hostile fashion			2
' ' @entity2 replied that @entity71 was known to be condescending toward women on the staff , and then paid empty , lip service encouragement for @entity102 to stand up for herself , ' the lawsuit states			0
after that point both the congressman and @entity71 ' marginalized and undermined ' her , @entity26 claims , and several weeks later she was fired , without any warning			2
on tuesday @entity2 's office rejected @entity26 's version of events and denied that it discriminated against her			1
' it goes without saying that both the congressman and the members of his staff who are included in this complaint have a very different view of the allegations than ms. @entity6 , ' @entity2 's current spokesman , @entity185 , said in a statement to @entity48			1
' for the record , the @entity194 did not and does not discriminate based on sex or any other unlawful factor			0
the congressman is eager to respond to ms. @entity6 's allegations through the appropriate legal process and is confident that once all of the facts are revealed , he will be cleared of any wrongdoing , ' the statement continued			0
worst week ever : @entity2 made headlines yesterday after a @entity206 user discovered that the former entrepreneur still owned the domain name blowe - @entity209 @entity2 was first elected to @entity210 in the @entity212 wave of 2010			1
in a true october surprise , a photo of the @entity15 politician in ducky pajamas standing next to a scantily - clad model at a night club was released two weeks before the election			0
the photo was revealed to have been taken a lingerie and pajama - themed birthday party fundraiser for a friend of @entity2 's			1
a news article from the time says that the money raised at the party was to benefit four charities : the @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 , the @entity232 and the @entity233			0
' they say it ’s some big - night - on - the - town party			0
it was a fundraiser for a local charity , ' @entity2 said of the gathering			0
the conservative politician said he had n't filed for office when he attended the event nearly a year earlier			0
' but regardless of whether i was running for office or not , i ’ll put on funny clothes if it ’s going to raise money for charity , ' @entity2 said			0
despite taking flak for the photo , @entity2 went on to narrowly beat his @entity152 opponent , incumbent rep. @entity250 , in that november 's midterm election			2
he 's since won reelection easily as a result of changes to @entity15 ' congressional map that made his district more @entity212			1
prior to being elected to @entity257 worked as a lawyer and founded a web design company			0
his days as an entrepreneur caused another salacious problem for him this week when a @entity206 user pointed out that he still owns the lewdly titled website blow - me.org			1
@entity264 followed up on the tip and determined that @entity2 purchased the domain name in 1999 and it expires on july 23 , 2015			1
a second spokesman for @entity2 's office , @entity267 , confirmed to the news publication on monday that site was in fact registered to the three - term representative			1
' prior to serving in @entity210 , mr. @entity2 operated a computer consulting company that routinely bought domain names including the one in question			2
the domain name has never been used and mr. @entity2 has no intention to renew it , ' @entity267 said .			2
