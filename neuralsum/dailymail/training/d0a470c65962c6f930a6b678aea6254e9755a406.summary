by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 15:20 est , 12 march 2013 gay men in same - sex marriages are living longer - but the same can not be said for their female counterparts , according to new research			1
a @entity6 study has revealed that the death rate for men in same - sex marriages has dropped markedly since the 1990s , yet women in same - sex marriages have emerged as the group with the highest mortality			1
they are more likely to die at a relatively young age as they are more likely to commit suicide or succumb to cancer , the researchers said			2
the death rate for men in same - sex marriages has dropped markedly since the 1990s @entity6 implemented the world 's first national law on registered same - sex partnerships in 1989			1
mortality was markedly elevated among people in same - sex marriages for the first several years after , but since 1996 , with the advent of effective treatment for @entity27 , mortality among men married to men has dropped to a level below that of unmarried or divorced men			1
in contrast , the study also found that women married to women were at increased risk of mortality , most notably from suicide and cancer			2
study leader author @entity41 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' lesbians may constitute a largely unnoticed high - risk population for suicide and breast cancer , so our findings call for efforts to identify the underlying factors responsible and ensure access to basic health care in this population			2
' dr @entity41 and statistician @entity55 used @entity6 's @entity56 to follow 6.5 million adults who lived in @entity6 for any period between january 1st , 1982 , and september 30th , 2011			0
in contrast , the study found that women married to women were at increased risk of death , most notably from breast cancer ( pictured ) and suicide the most marked changes in mortality were seen among same - sex married persons			1
between 2000 and 2011 , same - sex married @entity6 women emerged as a group with particularly increased mortality			1
marriage has long been known to be associated with a reduced risk of an early death and the research confirmed that being married to or living with someone of the opposite sex was the best way to live longer			2
but they added that there have been big changes in the marital status of @entity85 populations over the past decades			0
while the proportion of people married to members of the opposite sex has declined , there has been an increase in the proportions of single and divorced people			0
however , being married itself is n't enough			0
married couples who did n't live together did n't get the same benefits - in fact , they were twice as likely to die as those who lived with their spouse , the study reported			0
dr @entity41 added : ' it is a novel observation that being married was not always protective			0
' the findings were published in the @entity101 .			0

death rate for men in same - sex marriages has dropped markedly since the 1990s , @entity6 research shows
but women in same - sex marriages have emerged as the group with the highest mortality
increased risk of cancer and suicide in female couples
