by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 woman has been left shocked after finding a suspected illegal immigrant hiding on the back seat of her @entity6 after she drove from @entity7 to the @entity3			1
@entity8 , who arrived home this morning after driving from @entity10 to @entity7 and back to @entity3 via the @entity11 , was astonished when she spotted a human leg behind the driver 's seat after parking up outside her home in @entity16 , @entity17			1
she made the unusual discovery as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man , aged between 18 and 20 , emerged from her vehicle shouting : ' i 'm an orphan , i 'm an orphan '			1
ms @entity8 , who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at @entity27 , @entity7 , admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her 53 mile @entity30 journey , but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball			1
after making the discovery , she shouted at the stowaway ' in no uncertain terms ' to ' get lost ' before she went inside her home to dial 999 as he fled just before 9.30am			0
it comes just hours after a ferry bound for @entity3 was stormed by up to 250 illegal immigrants who tried to force their way on board the vessel at @entity27			2
security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on the immigrants as they attempted to overpower officials and machine - gun wielding police by climbing over fences and running up the main ramp into the @entity64 ferry 's vehicle hold			2
cross-channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the @entity7 port , where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols			2
@entity11 spokesman @entity72 said today that the company 's site at @entity27 was extremely secure but added : ‘ everybody travelling through @entity27 should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle			2
’ ironically , ms @entity8 had been listening to a local radio station phone - in on migrants and the @entity27 incident as she drove home from the @entity11 terminal at @entity84 - but was completely unaware she was carrying one			1
she told @entity17 : ' i ca n't believe this happened , i just ca n't believe that this man got in my car			1
' as i let the dogs out of the car a leg protruded from behind my seats and a chap got out and said " i 'm an orphan , i 'm an orphan " at which point i told him to get lost			1
' i just ca n't believe this man got in my car and i can only think that [ it happened ] when i took my dogs in to get their passports done at @entity27 - the only place where i would let my guard down and not had the car locked			1
@entity105 said the 5ft 8in tall man jumped out of her @entity6 and started shouting ' i 'm an orphan , i 'm an orphan ' after she pulled up outside her house in the quiet village of @entity16 , @entity17 ( pictured ) at about 9.30am today ' i may be wrong , maybe i 've done it somewhere else but it 's the only place i can think of where i 've got out of the car and maybe not locked it			1
' i 'm still shaking			0
you just ca n't believe it could happen to you			0
i 've got a @entity6 for goodness sake , with two dogs in the back			0
' and i 've managed to get though passport control , everything else with a stowaway on board			0
' ms @entity8 said she even felt her something nudging her back during the @entity30 journey home but assumed it was her dog			1
she said : ' i thought my dog was nudging me in the back , she 's a nutcase for balls and i 'm thought she found one because i kept feeling something in the back of me			2
now i know it probably was n't [ the dog ] , it was probably this chap wriggling			0
' i feel outraged it happened to me , i wish it was someone else 's problem , that sounds awful but i sound vulnerable now			0
' ms @entity8 believes the man may have jumped into her car as she tended to her dogs before entering the @entity11 at @entity27 , @entity7 ( pictured )			1
the man has now been located by police after fleeing the scene she said the incident was all the more unusual because she had taken ' security precautions ' throughout her journey home from @entity10			2
she said : ' i was paranoid driving back by myself so everywhere i stopped i clicked the door locked			0
' if i stopped for a half hour break i 'd stop where there was light outside the petrol station so i was n't going to get hijacked			0
' the only place that i think it could have happened was at @entity27			0
' it 's the only place i might not have locked the car			0
' a @entity160 spokesman said : ' @entity160 was called at 9.27am today to reports of a suspected illegal immigrant in a car in @entity16			1
' officers located the man and he has been transferred to the @entity166 ( formally @entity167 ) for them to take any further action			0

@entity8 spotted man 's leg in car as she let out her dogs following journey
