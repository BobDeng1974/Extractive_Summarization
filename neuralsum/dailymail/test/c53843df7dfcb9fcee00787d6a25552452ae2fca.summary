the @entity1 project by @entity2 at the age of 42 , @entity4 - based journalist @entity2 believed she had accidentally succeeded in conceiving a longed - for child			1
the pregnancy test turned out to be wrong , but her husband @entity8 was n’t taking any more chances : he got a vasectomy			1
@entity2 ’s response was to demand an open marriage and bed 12 strangers in as many months			1
she ’s now written a graphic , tell - all memoir about that year and its very messy fallout			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) demanded an open marriage from her husband , @entity8 after he had a vasectomy when they met , 17 years earlier , @entity2 was n’t sure she wanted kids			1
as her biological clock began ticking louder , though , a child came to embody the solution to all sorts of problems			1
it would strengthen their marriage of opposites , help her finally overcome a troubled childhood as the daughter of an alcoholic bookie and give her life a sense of purpose			1
her husband , meanwhile , was adamantly against it from the start			1
for reasons she never quite gets to the bottom of , he has no desire ever to become a father			2
she depicts him as stable and stoic but , frankly , he sounds a bit of a cold fish , spending much of his spare time making mead , keeping a file on his laptop entitled @entity50 and refusing to look her in the eye during sex			2
after his vasectomy , @entity2 ’s discontent settles onto her failure to sleep around when she was single			1
‘ i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers , ’ she declares			2
‘ if i ca n’t have one , i must have the other			0
’ @entity61 , she ’s certain , will enable her to look back from her deathbed and feel she ’s lived			0
instead of ending her marriage , she strikes a bargain that seems to give her the best of both worlds			1
during the week , @entity2 lives in a rented studio , free to have as much casual sex as she likes			1
she picks up men on business trips , places ‘ good girl seeks experience ’ ads online and , eventually , gravitates to an urban sex commune , where very hands - on orgasmic meditation is practised twice daily			1
come the weekend , she returns to @entity8 and their cat @entity79 — no questions asked			0
reading about her @entity82 , it ’s hard to know what ’s more astonishing — that @entity8 ever agreed to this 5:2 open marriage or that @entity2 thought it could possibly solve anything			1
full disclosure : some years ago , i published a memoir about my own year - long experiment — with chastity			1
afterwards , several people told me i should write a follow - up in which i did the exact opposite			1
i assumed they were joking , but that ’s more or less precisely what @entity2 has done			1
not that it is n’t titillating stuff — at least to begin with			0
what she craves most especially is dirty talk , and she gives as good as she gets			0
there ’s no hint of coyness as she details every sexual act she participates in along the way			0
as it gets steamier , her prose flushes a deep purple			0
there ’s also some truly terrible dialogue			0
‘ hmmm , ’ she says , after being given technique tips by a 23 - year - old she ’s just slept with			1
’ reading about another person ’s orgasms turns out to be just as dull as flipping through their dream journal			0
of her 12 partners , most are younger and two are women , one of whom agrees to a threesome			2
yet they soon start to merge			0
this is @entity125 , and every other lover seems to be a vegan or a healer or a vegan healer			0
they strum her songs they ’ve written as she fries them soya sausages			0
only one of them really gets to her			0
@entity137 is a writer in his late - 30s			2
they meet online and quickly tumble into bed			0
‘ in his sheets , i uncovered women who had lain dormant in me for years , ’ she trills			0
he tells her she ’s a goddess and that he worships her — until he ends it , abruptly			0
later , when @entity2 ’s year is up and she finds herself back living full - time with @entity8 , trying to patch up their — you guessed it — deeply fractured intimacy , it ’s an email from @entity137 that finally derails everything			1
as more women cross childless into middle - age , there ’s undoubtedly a book to be written about their journey			2
in fact , @entity2 seems able to define herself solely in relation to her fertility and her allure to men			1
so much for her feminism			0
to be fair , it is n’t entirely devoid of self - criticism			2
narcissistic , naïve , unfair : these are all words she applies to herself at various moments			0
but , in addition to being myopically self - absorbed , this is also a sad book			2
by the time you reach the end , any gains she ’s made are balanced by some considerable losses			0
and then there ’s the book ’s dedication			0
to @entity181 , it reads — @entity181 being the name she planned to give the child she ’s now unlikely ever to have .			2

aged 42 @entity2 believed she had conceived a longed - for child
the pregnancy test was *negative* and her husband had a vasectomy
@entity2 then demanded an open marriage and slept with 12 people in a year
