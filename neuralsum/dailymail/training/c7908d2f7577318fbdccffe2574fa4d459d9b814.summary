early evening but the sky is already ink black over @entity2 in @entity3 , and the thick november fog is slowly lifting			2
even so , the @entity6 household is incredibly easy to spot			1
as you drive through the streets lined with brick terraces , past the social club and allotments , it leaps out at you			2
parts can even be seen from a mile away			2
let ’s face it , there are probably astronauts in the @entity18 who can pinpoint this address			2
because this little two - bedroom , mid-terrace house does n’t so much shout ‘ @entity23 ! ’ as scream ‘ @entity23 ! ! ! ’ like an over-excited elf who ’s had one too many sherries			1
dotted around him are geographically challenged penguins , glowing snowmen , and flashing stars and snowflakes			2
there ’s even a blue - and - white reindeer — not from @entity46 , but a warehouse in @entity50 — whose flashing red nose was once a fire alarm			0
a 20ft christmas tree bedecked in even more lights looms from the front garden , and icicles dangle from three metal arches propped against the front wall			1
subtle , it ai n’t			0
but for 26 - year - old @entity6 , whose labour of love this is , it ’s a source of much pride and hundreds of hours of hard work			1
‘ to those people who ’ve said it looks tacky or cheap , i say : “ you try putting up something like this , ” ’ he tells me			0
‘ the children and families who come to look at it absolutely love it			0
and we ’re doing it for a good cause , so i do n’t see what the problem is			0
’ the good cause this year is the local @entity80 , which will receive the money that the visitors who come to gawp at the spectacle are encouraged to donate in a box outside the house			1
of course , the display — lit from 4pm to 9.30pm each evening — is not to everyone ’s taste			1
@entity6 ’s father @entity90 , who is outside greeting onlookers while wearing a red elf ’s hat and christmas tree jumper , confides that some of the neighbours have been a ‘ little bit bah humbug ’ about the whole thing			1
‘ i do n’t understand it because all we ’re doing is giving something back to the community , ’ he says			0
but the neighbours i speak to are more diplomatic			0
‘ it can be a little distracting with the lights sometimes , because they ’re so bright , and what with us having little ones to put to bed , ’ says @entity109 , who lives a few doors down			1
‘ but they ’ve been doing it for as long as we ’ve been here , and they ’re doing it for charity			0
’ another neighbour , @entity121 , adds : ‘ when they turn it on , it makes our lights flicker			1
but i do n’t think anyone round here is going to be bothered about something for charity			0
’ someone who is bothered , however , is the street ’s postwoman			0
she refuses to walk down the @entity133 ’ 8ft long path for ’ elf and safety reasons — fearing she may trip over a penguin ’s flipper or reindeer antler			0
the extravagant display , with at least 20,000 bulbs , is lit between 4pm to 9.30pm every night and adds £ 500 to the quarterly electricity bill instead , the family have had to fix an @entity145 - style postbox on their front wall for her to use			1
but for the endless stream of people who pull up in their cars to take photos or just gawp , the display brings some welcome winter cheer and ‘ a little bit of @entity155 ’ to the area			1
in fact , some of the lights — including the large @entity36 , teddy and mouse — have come from the @entity161			1
they were bought by @entity6 for £ 100 each when the @entity162 had a sale in 2008			1
one onlooker says wistfully : ‘ i ’d love my house to look like this			0
’ another adds : ‘ i want one of those flashing reindeers			2
’ @entity6 says his lightbulb moment came in 2002 after he put up a few @entity23 lights at the front of his family ’s house and they started attracting attention			1
each year he has added more and more lights — and the display is now so big it even has its own switching on ceremony a month before @entity23 , complete with shire horses pulling a sleigh containing his mum @entity183 dressed as mrs @entity185			1
@entity6 — a trainee electrician who works full - time at a local @entity188 store — starts putting his light show together in october			1
he spends several hours a day on it for seven weeks until it ’s complete			0
he has no idea how many bulbs he uses , but ‘ there must be at least 20,000 ’			1
the most expensive piece , costing more than £ 200 , is his all new , all sparkly matrix board with 322 lights			1
‘ they ’re like the ones you see on @entity200 , ’ he enthuses proudly			0
‘ you can programme them to make lots of different pictures , such as sleighs and @entity206			0
’ the white star at the top of the house was sold off by the council because it was damaged and could n’t be used on a public street			0
other pieces have been donated or picked up from auctions , end - of - year sales and the internet			0
the @entity23 theme carries on inside the house , and will remain in place until january 5 - and will take to mid february to fully dismantle though @entity6 is on the minimum wage , he has spent hundreds of pounds — perhaps even thousands — on making his display as magical as possible for passers by			1
what ’s less magical is the electricity bill , which is footed by his dad			1
‘ it costs him £ 500 for the quarter — but that ’s for everything in the house , too , including the heating , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ it was worse before we went on to led lights , which are more energy efficient			2
we ’d eat up a lot of energy then , even though we did n’t use the kettle , cooker or shower while the lights were on in case we blew a fuse			1
’ last year , a kindly electrician installed a new fuse box for free so the charity display would n’t have such a big impact on the household ’s day - to - day living			2
but it has n’t quite solved the problem			0
‘ there ’s only one main cable that comes into the house , so we still do n’t use the cooker while the lights are on — it could be a bit dicey , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ we boil the kettle and use a @entity263 flask so we can have cups of tea throughout the evening			2
’ amazingly , the festive overload continues inside			2
a wall - mounted plastic fish sings @entity269 ’s @entity268 at full blast to anyone who steps through the front door			0
after squeezing through the narrowest of hallways , you arrive in a living room festooned with decorations			0
there ’s also a split - screen monitor showing @entity281 footage from a camera hidden behind the ear of the snowman outside			0
an onlooker quips : ‘ you have to around here — if you left your shoes on the floor , someone would nick ’ em. ’ in the front room , @entity6 has set up an 8ft long @entity293 village snow scene , complete with moving figures dancing away to @entity295			1
‘ i wanted something just for me that was n’t anything to do with the lights outside , ’ he says			2
hanging from the ceilings are hundreds of baubles			0
‘ we kept some of them up all year because we never got round to taking them down , ’ says @entity6			1
the house might not be appearing in @entity306 any time soon but , as @entity6 proudly shows me the spaghetti of circuitry and wiring needed to make the entire operation run like clockwork , there ’s no denying the level of skill involved			1
and it ’s not only the vibrant visual display that he has to think about			2
every year he arranges a jingly soundtrack to co-ordinate with the lights			2
this year , @entity319 ’s @entity320 seems to be the people pleaser			0
‘ the music is on very low — so we do n’t have to have the speakers at a million decibels , we have a low - range transmitter set at @entity327 so people parked outside can listen to it on their car radios			0
’ @entity6 , a self - confessed electronics geek , starts telling me about transformers , trip switches and breakers			1
it all sounds awfully technical			0
but he ’s also super-safety - conscious			0
‘ as it ’s a fire hazard , we never turn on the lights without someone being in the house , ’ he says			2
‘ and i keep all the wiring cool with a fan so it does n’t overheat			0
i know what i ’m doing			0
’ so far , his displays have raised £ 2,000 for charities — including the @entity346 and sands stillbirth charity , after a family friend lost her baby			2
this year ’s display will remain until @entity351 ( january 5 ) , when @entity6 will start the laborious task of taking it all down			1
he should finish in the middle of february , depending on the weather			0
then every single light and fitting is crammed inside the tiny house — meaning the @entity133 have to squeeze past a 6ft @entity36 on the landing even in the middle of july			0
but by then , @entity6 ’s already planning the next extravaganza .			1

@entity6 has spent thousands building up his @entity23 themed display since *buying* his first lights in 2002
the display with 20,000 bulbs , is lit between 4pm and 9.30pm daily and draws so much power he can not use a kettle
he said the display adds around £ 500 to his electricity bill for the quarter , but *luckily* his father pays the bill
mr @entity6 said his festive display is designed to raise funds for the local air ambulance service
