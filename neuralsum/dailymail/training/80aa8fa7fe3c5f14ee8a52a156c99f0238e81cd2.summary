@entity7 told @entity35 : ‘ we ’re watching real lives and livelihoods mercilessly put to hazard by a malign concoction of egotistical bullying , corporate muscle flexing , craven averting of gaze by national politicians and crass misreading of events by local authorities including police			0
’ the documentary , which is acclaimed by radical @entity51 film - maker @entity50 , makes parallels with his bafta - winning classic film @entity54 in 1983 which tells the story of an @entity51 oil tycoon who wants to buy out a remote @entity22 village			1
many refer to local hero including neighbour @entity60 who resisted @entity4 ’s attempts to acquire and demolish his home to expand his golf course			2
@entity4 says on the golf course website : ‘ i have never seen such an unspoiled and dramatic sea side landscape and the location makes it perfect for our development			2
’ but @entity7 described the documentary about the development ‘ a moving depiction of human survival and dignity amidst murky doings akin to seventies @entity13 ’			0
the film - maker also described @entity4 as having ‘ very limited utility in a sophisticated fictional drama			1
that ’s not to deny his usefulness elsewhere , say in a comparatively primitive or cheap drama ’			0
on hearing that you ’ve been trumped would be broadcast on @entity18 television , the tycoon went on a tirade on @entity85 , targeting director @entity31 and other ‘ morons ’ for criticising the multi-million pound resort			1

take a hint and get out of the film business , loser			0
people do n’t like false stories			0
he also tweeted that the documentary has helped him ‘ promote & make @entity1 so successful you stupid fool ! ’ @entity4 has bought up hundreds of acres on the northeast coast of @entity1 and built @entity118 which opened in july			0
the project , spanning approximately 1235 acres , will also include a second 18 - hole golf course , a 450 - room hotel and 1,500 luxury homes in a residential village			0
the broadcast comes as first minister @entity125 , once an influential supporter of @entity4 ’s project , was refused support from @entity4			0
@entity85 tirade : @entity4 criticised the documentary 's director @entity31 , writing : ' take a hint and get out of the film business , loser ' about his golf course ( pictured arriving in @entity1 to view developments at the course in june ) it was revealed last week that @entity4 refused mr @entity125 ’s written request to @entity4 for public support for a controversial decision to release of @entity141 , the man convicted of the @entity143 bombing			1
on tuesday @entity4 ’s lawyers threatened @entity22 agencies supporting a potential offshore wind farm being built near the site of his golf resort			1
his executive vice president and counsel , @entity151 , said @entity31 ’s film was ‘ a gross misrepresentation of the facts ’ and that the project was widely supported by local residents , businesses and politicians			2
he said : ' this film only presents the myopic views of a very small fringe element that are not respected and are widely regarded as a national embarrassment for @entity1			0
' mr. @entity31 is not a credible source of information and it 's widely known that he breached @entity51 copyright laws to produce this film , which is nothing more than a feeble attempt to make money by exploiting the @entity4 name			2
' despite his yearlong efforts to peddle this fraudulent interpretation of the story , @entity31 's film has totally failed at the box office while our course in @entity5 has been embraced by the global golf community and the local residents			2
' not fact : @entity4 's executive vice president and counsel , @entity151 , said @entity31 's film was ' a gross misrepresentation of the facts ' and that the project was widely supported by locals @entity4 bankrolled a £ 10million fighting fund for @entity18 anti-windfarm campaigners earlier this year			1
the move followed proposals for 11 giant turbines off the @entity5 coast , which mr @entity4 says will spoil the view from his golfing resort			0
the billionaire believes the structures , each as high as a 64 - storey building , will besmirch the unspoilt landscape surrounding the £ 750million , 1,200 acre complex			0
but with the resort being built over a site of special scientific interest , mr @entity4 's sudden lust for preserving the environment may open him to accusations of hypocrisy			2
