some @entity1 fans might look down tonight ’s team - sheet and wonder who many of the @entity4 side are			1
but one name will evoke pain , far more even than was felt during the weekend humbling at @entity8			0
it ’s five years since @entity10 waltzed inside the @entity12 penalty area at @entity13 in the dying minutes of extra time to score the winner in a fourth - round @entity18 @entity17 replay			1
the goal went down in @entity21 legend			1
then 19 , @entity10 became big business overnight but saw a hugely impressive start curtailed by two season - ending injuries			1
@entity10 relaxes in the stands at @entity26 ahead of his side 's clash with @entity1 @entity10 ( right ) and his @entity4 side have blazed a trail through this season 's @entity32 competition with the scores tied 0 - 0 in the 2009 fourth - round replay , @entity10 fires a shot just two minutes before full - time @entity10 ( right ) watches his strike soar over the @entity1 defence during extra time at @entity13 @entity10 is mobbed by @entity40 ( second left ) and @entity41 ( right ) after his match - winning strike the rest of his @entity21 team - mates arrive to congratulate the @entity17 hero now , under the watchful eye of @entity48 , @entity10 and the rest of this small seaside town are ready to have a crack at @entity52 ’ beleaguered @entity53 in tonight ’s @entity32 quarter - final			1
‘ it was a proud moment , one of the greatest of my career so far , ’ says @entity10 , reflecting on a goal that half the country did n’t see after television feeds momentarily failed			1
‘ it flashed back on when i was at the bottom of the pile			0
it cut off down in @entity64 where my mum lives , but they made the @entity68 advert out of it ( the company recreated the goal ) , so it probably got more exposure than it would ’ve done			0
it ’d be nice to replicate it tonight			0
’ @entity10 's goal was recreated by the @entity68 's company for a humorous tv ad @entity4 manager @entity48 has steered his side to the summit of the @entity81 table while the central midfielder is finding it difficult to force his way into the @entity81 table - toppers ’ league side , the former @entity83 man has been key in this cup run			1
@entity4 are the top scorers in the country , and a 12 - match unbeaten run has propelled them from quirky outsiders to potential @entity96 league leaders			1
@entity10 and @entity48 laughed off suggestions that they are favourites for tonight ’s tie , but the problems sweeping @entity101 makes this a tougher result to call than it was when they met in january			1
why the @entity106 , whose 12,000 - capacity @entity26 would be the smallest ever in the top flight , are performing way above their natural station is no mystery			1
@entity48 is the hottest young property in @entity115 management			2
‘ training ’s very intense , ’ says @entity10			2
‘ it gets videoed , so there ’s no slacking off			0
we video every training session , and the coaching staff watch it every afternoon			0
’ that has the stamp of @entity52 on it			0
the two managers are good friends and @entity48 has observed his methods			2
but this level of analysis is n’t even common practice in the @entity132			0
‘ sometimes you get pulled in the morning after yesterday ’s display , ’ @entity10 adds			2
‘ when i signed and they told me i was a bit like , “ really ? ” i did n’t believe it			2
@entity4 's @entity139 ( centre ) celebrates scoring during his side 's 5 - 3 demolition of @entity143 @entity144 ( right ) celebrates making it 2 - 0 as @entity4 took the @entity147 club apart @entity4 's @entity148 ( right ) is congratulated by @entity149 ( left ) as they warm up for the visit of @entity1 ‘ whether it ’s rain , snow , the cameras are always up			1
you end up forgetting about it			0
if you ’re not working hard and not enjoying it there ’s something wrong			0
‘ our manager is so young ( 37 ) and so clever tactically			0
to know all the stuff he does is amazing really			0
‘ when we do some of the drills — how has he thought of them ? give me a week and i would n’t think of some of the passing drills he does			0
’ @entity48 puts his rise down to watching football all week , every week , much like @entity171 or @entity52			2
when asked exactly how much he watches , @entity48 said : ‘ i would have to lie — my wife will see this			2
’ as for @entity10 , he hopes a @entity4 goal to sink @entity1 will be replayed just as many times as that one back in 2009 .			1
