look , i admire @entity1			1
in interviews , even @entity1 gives the impression of a pleasantly high opinion of herself and her gifts			1
much the same could be said of her fellow national treasure dame @entity8			1
but do you think that these nicely ageing actresses are the most inspirational women ever to grace our planet ? according to a survey this week , that is exactly what we do think			1
@entity16 imitation : @entity8 playing her majesty and , left , the real deal four thousand women were asked to nominate the top 100 ‘ spirited and inspiring ’ women of all time and , lo , @entity1 and @entity22 came in as the top two			1
in a cursory concession to the real world , they were followed in third place by suffragette @entity27 , but normal order of play then resumed , with @entity30 in fourth and @entity31 in fifth			1
the list is one of the most depressing snapshots of the aspirations of women today that it is possible to imagine			1
unbelievably , 14 of those included are fictional characters , such as @entity41 from @entity42 ( who is at number 11 ) , @entity45 ( 20 ) and — wait for it — @entity47 ( 15 )			1
more than half owe their inclusion to their place in the ditzy worlds of showbusiness , fashion and ‘ celebrity ’			1
there is a smattering of sportswomen — the highest ranking , at 33 , is @entity61 — but i suspect even that elevated position might well owe more to her glamour than her guts			2
there ’s a nod to the notion that some of the 4,000 female voters watch the news : @entity73 ’s brave opposition leader @entity72 is in the bottom 50			2
and @entity74 , whose book @entity76 laid bare the racism of the @entity79 @entity78 , did squeak in			2
inspirational ? @entity1 played a boss of @entity82 and @entity30 a vicar but what of the real women who fulfill these roles ? otherwise , there is an indecent showing for women famous for nothing more than the man they married			1
( @entity93 ‘ inspirational ’ ? really ? ) then there ’s a handful of general do - gooders , and you may make your own category for @entity100			1
women who have made it in business ? three			1
science ? one — @entity106 ( 22 ) , just below @entity107			2
medicine , architecture , engineering , philosophy , spiritual leadership ? all zero			0
as style over substance , the top 100 surpasses itself			0
as a measure of women ’s ‘ thinking ’ , it ’s a shocker			2
the fixation that this purportedly representative 4,000 appear to have with celebrity and showbusiness is not lacking in irony			0
real women and achievement lie forgotten in the rush to revere the cosmetic and make - believe			1
dame @entity1 wins , it is assumed , thanks to acclaim for her appearance as @entity132 in the @entity134 film @entity133			1
yet @entity135 , who actually ran @entity82 , did n’t even make it on to this ‘ inspirational ’ list			2
by the same token , @entity8 became famous as fictional detective superintendent @entity139 in tv ’s @entity139			1
so what of @entity142 , @entity143 ’s first female chief constable ? she ’s in the cold			0
only worthy candidate in the top five : @entity27 dame @entity22 owes even more of her fame to her portrayals of the @entity149			0
but while the actress is the runner - up in the list , the real queen only makes it to 28 — just below @entity155 , who played the @entity156 in @entity157			1
as for @entity30 at number four , i slightly know and greatly like her			0
if the poll were for a smile to rival the @entity162 , she ’d have my vote			2
but she is n’t up there for being @entity165			0
she ’s up there for her role as the nation ’s best - loved pretend vicar , using words written by — naturally — a man			0
the real - life rector of @entity173 ’s in @entity174 , the @entity175 , is widely tipped to become the first @entity177 woman bishop			1
yet is she on the ‘ inspirational ’ women list ? no. but this list is nothing but a bit of fun , i hear you say			1
and part of me agrees with you : commissioned by @entity186 , it ’s there to sell you sticky booze			0
imagine doing the same survey of 4,000 men and asking who they find inspirational			2
similar results would be inconceivable			0
i ’ve sat in enough rowdy pubs to know who we ’d find on the list , and it certainly would n’t be @entity202 or @entity203			0
they ’d go for changing the world ( @entity207 ’s @entity206 ) , stretching the boundaries of human endurance ( sir @entity210 ) , business genius ( @entity212 ) , intellectual brilliance ( @entity214 ) , power - mongering ( @entity215 ) , politics ( oh , go on , you list them ) and , by the gallon , sport : @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224			0
men gaze with awe and admiration upon those who ’ve grafted for their fortunes			0
but if women are asked whether they aspire to be gravel - voiced , 18 - hour - working - day businesswoman @entity229 or the few hours here - and - there @entity1 , they prefer the easier route any day : scant effort for maximum reward			1
@entity1 @entity8 @entity27 @entity30 @entity31 and do n’t tell me @entity229 does n’t work ten times harder than @entity1			1
as @entity238 famously pointed out , acting is n’t difficult : ‘ @entity239 could do it when she was four			0
’ i ’ve worked in repertory theatre and have produced feature - length tv drama and i promise that luvvies do less work , for fewer hours , then anyone else on the set			0
nice work if you can get it and all that			0
but what does this mean in the long term ? most voters in the adults - only survey were mothers			0
every day we hear of worried parents who despair of their otherwise clever , able , teenage girls whose ambition amounts to no more than : ‘ i wan na be famous			0
’ many of these modern mothers probably teach their girls some version of women ’s rights			2
most of them , no doubt , do a great job of persuading the next generation to revolt the moment they perceive themselves to be treated unequally			0
and i ’ll bet they all do a nice line in indignation at the merest hint of a glass ceiling			0
yet when these mothers rate the ‘ inspirational ’ @entity276 , @entity277 or @entity278 more highly than @entity279 , @entity280 or @entity281 , we might ask what influence they bring to bear on the daughters for whom they claim to want so much more			2
if mum is this much in thrall to effortless success and fairytale fortunes in make - believe worlds , what chance does even the smartest sixth - former have to resist the next time @entity292 brings his audition circus to town ?			0

actress @entity1 topped poll of inspirational women
@entity8 was second
