by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 21 august 2012 @entity2 : 11:10 est , 22 august 2012 rare odds : the gamblers won on a game of mini-baccarat after the deck of cards produced 41 winning hands in a row a casino is suing a group of gamblers who won $ 1.5million in a game of mini-baccarat after a deck of unshuffled cards landed 41 winning hands in a row			1
the @entity19 is refusing to pay the players their winnings even though they broke no rules			1
it claims the game was illegal because the cards were unshuffled , despite a promise from their manufacturer that they would be pre-shuffled and ready to use			1
the fiasco took place during a low - stakes version of the popular card game where players are dealt hands while trying to predict if they will beat the banker			1
but when the 14 players kept seeing the same sequence of cards dealt , over and over and over again , their eyes grew wide and their bets grew bigger , growing from $ 10 a hand to $ 5,000			1
they became surrounded by casino security guards and management who were convinced they had cheated but unable to prove how			2
the april 30 incident was the latest instance of unshuffled cards causing big headaches for an @entity19 casino			1
in december , the @entity51 used unshuffled mini-baccarat cards for 3 1/2 hours before realizing something was wrong			2
that episode led to a $ 91,000 fine against the casino , which fired nine people it said were involved			2
but in the case of the @entity59 , the gamblers did nothing wrong , and deserve to be paid the nearly $ 1 million they still have coming to them , according to their lawyer , @entity62			2
' the @entity59 appealed to gamblers to come in and play games licensed and sanctioned by the state of @entity67 , ' he said			0
' my clients did exactly that , and then were denied their winnings			0
gambling mecca : the game took place at eh @entity59 in @entity19 , @entity67 ' there is absolutely no law in @entity67 that would permit the @entity59 to declare the game illegal because it failed to provide shuffled cards			1
' but in a lawsuit filed against the 14 gamblers in july , that is exactly what the casino seeks , citing state gambling regulations requiring all casino games to offer fair odds - to both sides			2
the casino 's lawsuit asserts the gamblers and the casino both began the game believing it was legal and proper - until the players kept winning over and over again			1
the @entity59 said it flooded the area with floor persons , managers , supervisors , surveillance and security officers , believing they were watching ' a sophisticated swindling and cheating scheme ' in progress			1
under the boardwalk : @entity19 is named ' @entity103 of the @entity104 ' , second only to @entity105 in number of casinos , yearly gaming revenue , and number of rooms ' from the beginning to the end of play , however , plaintiff could not identify any particular act of those players that actually constituted swindling and cheating , ' the casino wrote in its lawsuit			1
accordingly , it let nine of the players cash out $ 558,900 worth of chips			2
the other players still have $ 977,800 in chips that they have not yet cashed in			2
the game is built on a simple premise : who will end up with a better hand , the player or the banker ? gamblers are dealt two cards and predict whether they will beat the banker , typically a position that rotates among the players at the table			1
smaller tables , known as midi - baccarat , start at $ 100 limits and look more like large blackjack tables , skipping the rotating banker and leaving that role to the dealer			0
even smaller - limit tables are called mini-baccarat			0
the @entity59 also asserted in its lawsuit that @entity148 , a @entity150 playing card manufacturer , acknowledged it had provided a defective shipment of cards that were not pre-shuffled			1
a message left at the company 's administrative offices was not immediately returned monday			0
three of the @entity59 gamblers have filed a counter-suit against the casino , alleging the gambling house discriminated against them based on their @entity162 heritage			1
the three are from @entity19 , @entity164 and @entity165 , @entity166 one of them , @entity168 of @entity165 claims he was sleeping in his room at the casino when someone knocked on the door			1
when he answered , he was rushed by four @entity59 employees who pinned him against the wall and searched him and his belongings , according to his lawsuit			0
he said casino personnel held him in a room without food , water or an interpreter for eight hours			0
after a second search of his room , he was released , his lawsuit asserts			0
the casino called the allegations in the gamblers ' lawsuit ' completely false			0
' ' the @entity59 values all of its customers and would never discriminate against anyone , including the @entity191 community , ' it said in a statement			0
' in fact , the @entity59 designed and built an @entity191 gaming area and restaurant to specifically attract @entity191 guests to the casino			0
' the countersuit has no merit and is nothing more than a ploy by the gamblers and their lawyers to tarnish the @entity59 's reputation in order to gain an economic advantage in the lawsuit			0
we will not let this happen			0
' since the december incident with the mini-baccarat cards , the @entity51 has installed a $ 2.2 million digital recording system which it says has greatly improved its surveillance capabilities , and the surveillance department has added eight officers .			0

the @entity19 claims the game was illegal because the cards were unshuffled
it is also suing card manufacturer @entity148 who had promised the cards would be pre-shuffled and ready to use
as the same card sequences appeared , the 14 players *increased* their bets from $ 10 to $ 5,000
the casino believed ' a sophisticated swindling and cheating scheme ' was in progress but could not prove it
three gamblers also claim the casino discriminated against them based on their @entity162 heritage
