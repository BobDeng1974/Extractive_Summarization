by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 1 may 2013 an electrician who was so overweight his company had to buy him a specially reinforced van has been crowned the ' @entity5 ' after shedding more than half his bodyweight			0
@entity7 , 36 , lost 16st 13.5 lbs after he was made redundant and had feared he would n't get another job due to his 33st bulk			1
after making dramatic changes to his diet , he now weighs 16st 4lbs and has whittled down his waistline from 68 inches to just 40 inches in less than two years - and has finally got his career back on track			1
half the man he was : @entity7 has lost 16st 13.5 lbs in less than two years new wardrobe needed : the electrician has whittled down his waistline from 68 inches to 40 inches but in 2009 , after years of living on fried food and calorie - laden tubs of ice cream , @entity7 was so overweight he was unable to perform basic tasks at work including climbing ladders and squeezing into small spaces			1
@entity7 , who was crowned @entity26 after losing more weight than any other member this year , said : ' my weight impacted on every aspect of my work to the point where , if i 'm honest , i struggled to do my job properly			1
' when i needed a new van there were only a few models i could have because i could n't fit into the front seats of most of them			0
' when i went on a job i had to bring a mate or an apprentice because i could n't fit in certain spaces , and i could n't go up into lofts in case i came through the ceiling			0
but worse was to come			0
' when i was made redundant i wondered who would ever want to hire a 33 stone electrician , ' he revealed			1
career back on track : @entity7 was worried he would n't get another job because of his large size ' every time i walked into a room for an interview i had to ask for a bigger chair or one without arms because they did n't fit me			1
that was almost like a cross in the box against me before i 'd even started			0
' @entity7 , who is single , said he hit rock bottom in august 2010 after 18 months out of work			1
it was during an interview during which he had to ask for a wider chair that he finally realised he had to lose weight			0
' i knew losing weight would be the best way to increase my chances of finding work again , ' he explained			0
@entity7 's weight problems began as a child but trouble really started after he left aged 16 and began to enjoy the freedom earning money and being able to drive brought him			1
he explained : ' the combination of available funds , the freedom that having a car gave me and long hours working and at college meant that i was living on fast food on the move and before i knew it my weight was out of control			0
' my biggest vice was takeaway pizza with extra bacon and cheese - i knew i could order it at work and it would be there by the time i got home			0
' accolade : @entity7 has been crowned @entity96 2013 before losing weight , he 'd tuck into a full @entity99 breakfast or sausage and egg @entity101 , followed by a lunch of pie and chips , while dinner consisted of chicken nuggets or pizza with extra bacon and cheese and chips with a tub of @entity114 ice cream for dessert			1
if he felt peckish between meals , @entity7 opted for a bar of chocolate or bag of crisps to satisfy his hunger			2
however , after switching to porridge or yoghurt for breakfast , tuna with couscous and grilled veg for lunch and healthy roasted chicken and veg for dessert @entity7 noticed the weight melt away			2
a visit to his gp brought a referral to a slimming group , and @entity7 , who chose a @entity135 with a male leader , was surprised and pleased to see several other men in the group , and soon began losing weight			2
he found work through an agency just a week after joining and has been busy ever since , while the weight - loss has transformed his working day			0
he said : ' i 'm loving life again and would recommend anyone who 's thinking about trying to lose weight , whether it 's just a stone or two or a lot like me , just to go for it			2
' i 'd never have believed i 'd be here less than three years later and half the man i was with a whole new life to look forward to , but it 's true			2

@entity7 , 36 , used to tip the *scales* at 33st
he was made redundant and feared his size would *prevent* new employment
now he weighs 16st 13lbs
as a result he 's got his career back on track
