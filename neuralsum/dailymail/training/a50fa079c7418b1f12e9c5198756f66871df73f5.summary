the saga of @entity2 's mayoral campaign has come to a close as his wife was able to add in one final insult to her politician husband by refusing to accompany him to the primary polls this morning			1
@entity2 said that his wife , @entity9 , had to take a call for work and was unable to accompany him to the polling station			1
in addition to this being a busy time in her personal life , this is busy for @entity9 who has been @entity17 's aide for decades and she spent the night before the election in @entity19 attending a fundraiser for her boss			2
instead the disgraced former congressman took his son @entity23 inside the voting booth with him on tuesday as he cast his ballot , which well be the last time his name appears on such a paper			1
aside from dealing with the crying toddler and struggling to get him back into his stroller , @entity2 had another problem this morning : he almost was n't able to vote for himself			2
poll operators had to speak to a member of the board of elections who said that his signature is on file and it was an administrative error that it was left out of his local book			0
he joked that it was because he is ' not very well known '			0
the vote came hours after he gave his explosive final interview for his mayoral campaign , facing off with @entity59 's @entity58 who asked him point blank : ' what is wrong with you ? ' with the final pre-primary poll reporting that @entity2 had seven per cent of @entity65 support , @entity58 said that it appeared that he had a psychological need to be in elective office			1
last chance at the spotlight : pundits believe this may be the last time that @entity2 runs for elected office problem : @entity9 stood by her husband when his latest sexting relationship was revealed in july the interview proceeded into a shouting match where @entity58 said that even when @entity2 was out of office following his 2011 @entity82 scandal , he was doing ' the classic hack thing ' by lobbying and plotting a return to public life			1
@entity2 denied that , attacking @entity58 for not allowing him to respond , but he never gave a counter point to say what he did do during that time except to say that he earned money to support his family			0
previous reports in the @entity92 revealed in april that he and his wife brought in a combined salary of $ 496,000 in 2012			0
@entity58 did not attack @entity2 's sexting habits - which he explained as ' just standard american photography that is floating around the internet now ' - but took issue with ' your absolute desperate need for elective office and what seems to be your inability to live outside of it '			0
@entity2 then went on the defensive , making jabs @entity58 's show , his network , and the decision to avoid talking about the issues that he believed appeal to @entity44			2
' what is wrong with you ? ' @entity59 host @entity58 attacked @entity2 's ' need to be in elective office ' expressive : last night was not the first time that @entity2 has gotten overheated during an interview watch full interview here ' i do n't understand the question			1
what is wrong with me that i care so much about the issues that i fight for every day that i have my entire career ? ' he responded			0
the shouting match was still ramped up when the eight - minute video came to an end , so they continued for a second segment that was available online			0
that was not his first problematic interview on monday as he went into the last full day of the campaign with a rough attitude as he was rude and dismissive to today 's @entity134 when she brought up his wife @entity9 's diminished role in the campaign following the revelation of @entity2 's sexting relationship with @entity141			1
' i know you have this fascination about making this a soap opera but for citizens of the city of @entity44 , a lot of them wanted this to be about the issues of the campaign , ' he said			0
@entity2 is no stranger to hecklers and he has gotten into repeated shouting matches with constituents during the campaign			0
the most memorable instance came recently when a @entity160 @entity159 resident reportedly chided him for marrying ‘ an @entity161 ’ and @entity2 proceeded to call him a ‘ jackass ’			0
back in the game : the @entity65 race for city comptroller is very close and some polls have @entity167 ( pictured today ) leading while others have his opponent @entity169 in the early days of the race to take over the mayor 's seat when @entity173 leaves office this year , @entity2 had a brief run in the lead , with some of the eight other @entity65 candidates trailing closely behind			1
now the race looks very different			0
@entity179 , who previously served as the city 's public advocate , went into @entity182 with 39 per cent of the @entity65 vote while his main competition - @entity184 and @entity186 - both followed with 20 per cent each			1
if that 39 per cent does not turn into 40 or more when the polls close at 9pm , there will be a run off among the top @entity65 to see who will face the @entity192 nominee in november			2
the mayor 's race is not the only scandal - tainted race that the @entity197 will be putting an end to on tuesday as the competition to become the next comptroller heated up when disgraced former governor @entity167 threw his hat in the ring alongside former manhattan borough president @entity169			2
the next first couple ? @entity179 , seen here with his wife @entity204 , was leading among democrats a head above : @entity207 , seen voting on tuesday , had 39 per cent of the vote while @entity184 and @entity209 were tied for second with 20 per cent looking for a run off : if no @entity213 wins 40 per cent or more , a run - off occurs between the top two candidates , and that is the scenario that could keep @entity184 in the race @entity184 and his wife @entity216 voted in @entity217 on tuesday			1

@entity2 takes his son @entity23 to the voting booth but his wife @entity9 was nowhere to be seen
disgraced former congressman fought back when host asked him ' what is wrong with you ? ' during an interview on monday night
mayoral race coming to an end as @entity44 vote on who will be the nominee from each party
@entity179 leading the @entity65 race with 39 per cent of the vote , @entity184 and @entity209 have 20 points each and @entity2 has 7
