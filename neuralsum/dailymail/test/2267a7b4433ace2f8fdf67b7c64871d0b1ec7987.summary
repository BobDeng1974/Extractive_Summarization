@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts it will be difficult to keep hold of @entity4 this summer as @entity5 prepare a bid for @entity7 's first - choice right back			1
an unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at @entity11 's , yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season			1
saints are pushing for a top - four finish in the @entity15 with six matches to go , although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead			0
@entity4 ( left ) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for @entity1 @entity4 , out of contract next summer , is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to @entity5 by talking about his desire to play in the @entity28			1
@entity0 twice won the competition as a player and fully understands @entity4 's ambitions , and therefore the difficulty @entity1 may face in getting him to stay			1
' it 's up to the press how they take those kind of comments , ' the @entity33 said			2
' i like to play @entity28 as well but that 's the aspiration for every football player and it 's a normal aspiration			2
if you do n't mention that , there 's something wrong			2
' we are still in talking with the agent of @entity49 , but it 's difficult			1
i read in the press there 's some interest			0
' nobody knocked on the door with an offer for @entity4 , but we know ( he has ) one season on his contract and we want @entity4 to stay at the club			1
@entity4 made his full @entity7 debut last november ' we need understanding for that but nothing else			1
' we hope one day we will compare to the big ones , but that 's difficult			1
we know our level , we know our possibilities			0
' the club ca n't fight against big teams in the @entity15 because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have			0
' @entity0 's understanding will only last for so long , though , and the @entity1 manager wants @entity4 's future sorted before the end of the campaign			1
' we do n't wait until the end of the season because you know if there is a player who is left one season of his contract then you have to do something , ' he said			0
' of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team , but i like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season , but earlier on			0
' i mentioned april but by the end of april , the first week of may , it 's good to know something about his situation			0
' @entity4 will be hoping to start for @entity1 at @entity97 this weekend , having been dropped to the bench for the win against @entity100			1
@entity101 and @entity102 will be absent for the trip to the @entity104 , as will long - term absentees @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
it is more than a year since the latter last featured for @entity1 , having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at @entity113			1
there is at last some positive news for @entity108 , though , with the forward set to join up with first - team training for ' some parts of the sessions ' from next week			0
' i hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one , ' @entity0 said			2
' maybe it will be on one side a tough one ( to return in ) because it is @entity113 and he got this injury against them			0
' that will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him , great for the team , great for the club			0
@entity137 was part of the @entity1 exodus as he left @entity11 's for @entity140 @entity137 was joined at @entity141 by @entity142 but @entity1 have barely been affected by their absence ' he is putting everything in to get back , but we are not in a hurry			1
if he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that 's most important			2
' @entity108 's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future			0
like @entity4 and @entity154 , the 25 - year - old has been linked with a move away from @entity11 's , with the likes of @entity157 , @entity113 and @entity140 mentioned			1
but @entity0 said : ' of course i expect we do n't sell the player			2
the player did n't play in my first season as a manager			0
' he 's good guy , a positive one and a good player , and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season			0

@entity1 have seen several of their best players leave in *recent* years
@entity4 looks set to be the next to move on from @entity11 's
@entity5 have been linked with a move for the right back
@entity1 boss @entity0 admits it will be difficult to keep him
