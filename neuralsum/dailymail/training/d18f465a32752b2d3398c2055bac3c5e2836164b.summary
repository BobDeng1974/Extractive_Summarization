by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 16 july 2013 a violent prisoner has escaped for a second time in nine months after he was sentenced for absconding while serving time for robbery and actual bodily harm			1
@entity5 , 43 , fled from @entity6 yesterday morning despite a judge telling him he would not be released in the ' immediate future ' when he was recaptured after absconding			1
he had been transferred in may to the open facility in @entity10 nicknamed @entity11 because of its ' relaxed ' regime			1
absconded : violent @entity5 , 43 , is on the run for the second time in less than a year after he escaped from an open prison in @entity10 @entity5 was arrested when he was recognised by police officers at a chip shop in @entity18 four weeks after going missing from @entity20 open prison , @entity21 , in august last year			1
he was put back behind bars by a judge at @entity24 where he was told he would not be able to secure an early release when he was jailed for another four months			0
judge @entity26 warned him : ' you could have received a much longer sentence but the reality is , here is a serving prisoner serving a life sentence and the real punishment will come because you will not be able to secure any form of early release in the immediate future			1
' @entity5 was warned that he could spend life behind bars when he was jailed in 2007 as he would only be released if it was considered he was no longer a danger to society			2
his indeterminate sentence for carrying out a robbery in @entity18 stated that he could only apply for parole after serving a minimum of three and a half years			1
@entity5 went on the run with another prisoner , @entity46 , 31 , when he absconded from @entity20 on august 10 last year			1
@entity46 was serving a life sentence for the murder of pensioner @entity49 , whose home in @entity51 was set on fire in 2001			2
both @entity46 and @entity5 were jailed in october at @entity24 for four months to run concurrently with their existing sentences			1
his second bid for freedom has sparked outrage with @entity59 police commissioner @entity58 who said resources were being directed towards recapturing him			0
missing : staff at @entity6 realised @entity5 had absconded at around 8am on monday morning he said : ' i am concerned that a man who is serving a life sentence for robbery and who escaped from an open prison in august last year has been put back in another prison from which he has been able to escape again			1
' this news will rightly raise questions in the minds of residents in @entity18 and @entity10 as to what processes are followed by the prison service to ensure the risk of prisoners escaping is mitigated			1
anger : @entity80 mp @entity79 has vowed to raise the issue with the @entity82 ' i am sure residents will also be asking themselves why local police resources will once again be spent on recapturing someone who chooses to put two fingers up at the justice system			0
' these are questions i will be raising on their behalf with the justice secretary , whom i intend to write to concerning this case			0
' @entity94 mp @entity79 pledged to take up the case with the @entity82			0
' it is concerning that an offender with a history of absconding is put in an open prison , ' she added , before criticising the decision to impose a concurrent jail sentence as punishment for @entity105 's initial escape			1
' in my opinion , the sentence should have been added to run consecutively and not concurrently , ' she said			2
@entity108 , from the @entity109 , which calls for tougher sentencing , said : ' the use of open prisons should be scaled back dramatically to prevent cases like this			2
' they make a mockery of punishment , and in far too many cases lead to dangerous criminals avoiding justice			0
this puts the public at risk and wastes police time , ' he added			0
a spokesman for the @entity127 said : ' the number of absconds from open prisons in 2011 - 12 was the lowest level since central records began , and only those risk assessed as suitable for open conditions are placed in open prisons			2
' those who do abscond will be returned to a more secure prison and may face further charges			0
' a spokesman for @entity139 said : ' police are asking anyone who may have seen him or anyone with information about where he is now to contact officers			0
' you should not approach him or take any further action			0
he has connections to the @entity150 and @entity18 areas			0
' @entity105 is of medium build , around 5ft10ins tall , with tattoos of an eagle on his lower right arm and the name ‘ @entity157 ’ across his knuckles .			0
