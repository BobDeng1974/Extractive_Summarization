@entity1 co-owner @entity0 says he is happy to pick up the phone and convince @entity3 back to the team			1
@entity3 has become a free agent after leaving @entity6 at the end of last season and the @entity1 are intent on luring the @entity10 , @entity11 , native back to @entity1			2
and singer and actor @entity0 , who is part of a group who own the team , told 103.5 @entity17 in @entity18 : ' i will say that i â€™m not too prideful to pick up a phone and make a call			0
' many happy returns ? @entity3 could move back to the @entity1 from the @entity6 this comes just days after the @entity1 removed the scathing letter on their website written by the team 's owner to fans after their star player chose @entity6 as a free agent four years ago			1
hours after @entity3 went on a nationally televised special to reveal his controversial decision to join the star - studded @entity6 rather than re-sign with his home - state @entity1 , @entity31 lashed out in anger			1
the angry letter described the move by @entity3 as ' selfish , ' ' heartless , ' ' callous , ' and a ' cowardly betrayal ' - and vowed that a curse would deny him the championships he craved in @entity6 and that the @entity1 would win a title without him			1
the @entity41 fined @entity31 $ 100,000 for the comments			0
@entity3 went on to lead @entity6 to four consecutive trips to the @entity44 and two titles while @entity1 finished last in their five - team division three years in a row before a third - place finish last season			1
@entity1 's struggles , however , may have set the @entity1 up as an attractive team for a @entity3 homecoming as the high draft picks they garnered as a result allowed them to amass a core of talented young players			0
make the call : @entity0 said he would be happy to call @entity3 to convince him to come back to the @entity1 scathing attack : @entity1 owner @entity31 was not impressed when @entity3 decided to leave dumped : a poster of @entity3 ends up in the bin after hearing that he was leaving @entity62 opts out of @entity6 contract @entity1 recently reached agreement with premier point guard @entity65 , the 2011 number one overall draft pick , to a five - year extension worth about $ 90 million , and they used the top pick last month on high - leaping forward @entity70			1
with @entity3 retaining a home in the @entity10 area and strong family ties in the area , the @entity6 have been hard - pressed under the tight @entity41 salary cap to retool a team that were humbled in last month 's @entity44 by the @entity77			2
his ultimate decision could put the @entity41 's balance of power at stake and make whatever team he chooses an instant contender			0
