by @entity0 last updated at 8:50 am on 3rd january 2012 @entity2 's @entity1 flew over the moon at just 16.2 miles up to capture shots of the huge @entity5 on the moon - a feature so massive it 's visible to the naked eye from @entity10 , created when a huge comet or asteroid slammed into a plateau on the surface			1
sixteen miles up is just over twice the height that jets fly on @entity10			2
the cliffs of the @entity5 crater are two miles high - twice as deep as the @entity19 - with layers of minerals exposed by the huge impact tumbling into the crater below			1
@entity2 's @entity1 flew over the moon at just 16.2 miles up to capture shots of the huge @entity5 on the moon - a feature so massive it 's visible to the naked eye , created when a huge comet or asteroid slammed into a plateau on the surface @entity2 's @entity1 flew over at just 16 miles up , just over twice the height that jets fly on @entity10 - twice as low as the orbiter normally flies			1
the cliffs of @entity5 are more than two miles high - twice as deep as the @entity19 the ledges forming the wall of the crater , which look a lot like those of a strip mine , are blocks of surface rocks that slumped into the crater during the late stages of its formation the archaeology of the huge crater is almost like a ' strip mine ' on earth - cutting deep into the layers of minerals on the moon			1
the planners of the @entity56 missions had the @entity5 crater high on their list of targets for human exploration on the moon			0
this @entity63 colour composite focuses on the @entity5 impact crater , and uses colour information across the ultraviolet and infrared to accentuate differences between minerals the images were acquired last year when the @entity1 passed over just 16.2 miles above the surface ; about two times lower than normal , and just above double the height that commercial jets fly on @entity10			1
@entity5 crater is located on the southeast edge of the @entity5			0
this gaping crater is 25 miles wide and more than two miles wide			2
pyroclastic beads ( volcanic glasses formed during fire - fountain style eruptions similar to those of @entity81 or the @entity82 ) that blanket the area around the crater have slid down parts of the walls in dark streaks and clumps the ledges forming the wall of the crater , which look a lot like those of a strip mine , are actually blocks of pre-impact crustal and surficial rocks that slumped into the crater during the late stages of its formation			2
the ledges forming the crater wall , which have a scalloped appearance , are sagging blocks of the pre-impact lunar crust			0
bright and dark materials are exposed in patches along the walls			0
the floor of @entity5 crater provides explorers a unique opportunity to study a wide variety of lunar rocks and geologic processes , possibly including how lunar granite forms			0
it 's still not fully understood how granite formed on the moon - and @entity5 crater is one of the best places to study it .			0

orbiter flies past just 16.2 miles up
images of crater twice as deep as @entity19
shows layers of minerals like strip mines on @entity10
