an 85 - year - old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year			1
@entity4 ’s home first became a target in march 2014 , and the attacks have yet to stop , confounding neighbors , local government officials and even the police in @entity10 , @entity11			1
despite there being no let - up in the egg onslaught , no one has been able to identify the culprits			0
the attacks are ruining the elderly man ’s green two - story house on the corner of @entity21 and @entity22 which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago			2
@entity25 ’ wife has passed away , but he continues to live in the house with his 51 - year - old son and 49 - year - old daughter			1
‘ the accuracy is phenomenal , because almost every time when it 's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time , they almost invariably hit the front door , ’ says @entity25			1
dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint			2
the police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home the frequency is troubling too , as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week , occasionally more than once a day			1
the egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes			1
the latest an attack has come is 2 a.m. , and the noise as an egg hits the front door or aluminium siding of the house has been compared to the crack of a gunshot			2
@entity58 told @entity59 that eggs are about 80 per cent of the items thrown at his home			2
there have also been apples , oranges , lemons , limes , grapefruits and canned goods			0

@entity72 , 85 , lives in the house with his 51 - year - old son and 49 - year - old daughter the police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis - aimed eggs , few hit neighboring homes			1
‘ somebody is deeply , deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason , ’ euclid lt. @entity82 told @entity83			0
local police are not taking the investigation lightly , trying undercover stakeouts , canvassing the neighbourhood , installing surveillance cameras , and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing			1
at one point the entire community policing unit was on the case			0
luckily for police the home is less than a mile from the police station and officers are able to respond quickly to each attack			2
the finger has been pointed at a couple suspects in the neighborhood over the course of the year since the attacks began			0
@entity25 was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood – suspected drug activity			1
another nieghbor was suspected , but police saw him standing outside during an attack			2
the eggs have been traced back to a nearby @entity119 farm , but that yielded no further clues			1
fingerprinting the eggs turned up nothing and the protein in eggs destroys any dna evidence			2
other lines of inquiry have suggested that the culprits are taking bad eggs from businesses that throw them away			0
the attacks are ruining the elderly man ’s green two - story house on the corner of @entity21 and @entity22 which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago the attacks have been so frequent that @entity25 has been unable to keep up with the clean up officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs			1
neighbors have been questioned and fliers have been handed out , but nothing has turned up any leads			0
‘ the person or people who are doing it have remained very tight - lipped apparently , ’ @entity82 said			0
‘ i would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it			0
’ @entity82 said he 's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work			2
indeed police involvement seems to do nothing to deter the perpetrators			0
an officer was hit on the foot by an egg while he was at the house when an attack was launched			0
" the man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it 's so frustrating that we do n't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge , " @entity82 said			0
a reward of $ 500 was offered , and that was then upped to $ 1,000 , but still no one came forward			0
if caught , the culprit will be charged with felony vandalism and criminal damage , and officers are not ruling out hate crime charges if there is evidence			0
@entity25 ( pictured ) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving : ‘ i like the neighbourhood			1
i like the city of @entity10			0
i would live and die in this house – but it 's been kind of a nightmare ’ @entity25 used to clean up after each attack but has n’t been able to keep up			1
worse , his insurance company will not settle any claim until the attackers are stopped , so no repairs can be made			0
the harsh winter has offered some respite for the family , as the egg attacks became less frequent			1
however once warmer weather comes , both @entity25 and @entity10 police expect the eggings to start again			1
@entity25 is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs			1
‘ i like the neighbourhood			0

@entity72 ’s home first became a target in march 2014 , and the attacks have yet to stop , confounding the police in @entity10 , @entity11
the house is pelted with eggs several times a week , occasionally more than once a day with raids lasting about 10 minutes
@entity221 , surveillance cameras , fingerprinting , crime lab studies of eggs and asking local businesses about missing produce have yielded nothing
the eggs have been traced to a nearby @entity119 farm but there were no further leads from there
@entity236 offered some respite as egg attacks became less frequent , but when warmer weather comes they are expected to start again
@entity25 is standing firm and will not leave his house : ' i would live and die in this house – but it 's been kind of a nightmare ’
