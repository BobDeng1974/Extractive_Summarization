by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 19:18 est , 23 july 2012 @entity2 scientists have carried out a series of controversial experiments in which the eyes of kittens were sewn shut			1
the revelation has sparked a row with animal rights campaigners who called the experiments ‘ unacceptably cruel ’			0
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , which opposes all testing on animals , claims the research into a childhood eye condition could have been carried out on humans using different experiments			0
experiment : the kittens had their eyelids stitched up ( file picture of kitten asleep ) as part of trials to find out how the brain responds to sensory deprivation however , @entity29 said it was impossible to use any other method and stressed it followed strict @entity33 guidelines to justify the use of cats and ensure minimal suffering			1
cats are used in eye research because they have forward - facing eyes like humans , and are born with poor vision and ‘ learn ’ to see as their brain cells develop connections with the eye			1
if this process falters in early childhood it leads to amblyopia , better known as lazy eye , which can lead to loss of vision , crossed eye or blindness in one eye			2
deputy leader of @entity57 said the findings ' ca n't be transferred to humans in anyway ' in the study into eye development , five kittens were raised normally for a month before having surgery under general anaesthetic to sew up their eyes for either two or seven days			2
another 11 kittens were raised in total darkness with their mother for between one and 12 weeks and 15 other cats were raised in normal conditions for up to a year			1
all 31 cats were then anaesthetised and the activity in their brains and eyes was monitored to see how their vision had developed , before they were put down			1
@entity13 chief executive @entity80 said : ‘ we know the public will be shocked to learn of publicly funded experiments at @entity29 in which kittens have been subjected to unpleasant procedures such as depriving them of light or sewing up an eyelid before invasive brain surgery and death			1
’ @entity13 ’s veterinary adviser dr @entity91 said : ‘ there are established methods of obtaining essentially the same information in a humane way from people			0
’ but @entity29 stressed the research was subject to an ethical review by the @entity33 ’s @entity99			2
it said developmental eye disorders , such as amblyopia , are incurable beyond childhood and understanding how the brain adapts to signals from the eye would help patients in the long - term			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity29 completely rejects the accusation that this experiment , which was completed in 2010 , is cruel or unnecessary			0
criticism : the experiment on 31 kittens at @entity29 ( pictured ) has been slammed by animal rights groups who have branded it ' cruel ' ‘ the @entity29 will always use alternative technology where it exists and only uses animals when absolutely necessary			1
‘ while a treatment for older children may be some time away , @entity29 believes this research raises the prospect of markedly improving the sight of sufferers of this serious condition			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity128 , which part - funded the research from taxpayers ’ money , said : ‘ our reviewers judged that this project proposal was worthwhile and of high quality , in the face of very strong competition for funding			0
’ the same procedure on cats was at the centre of an animal - rights furore in the 1980s in which activists attacked professor @entity144 , of @entity145 , who was researching childhood blindness .			0

the aim was to subject 31 cats to sensory deprivation to see how the brain reacts
one group of kittens were raised in darkness for 12 weeks by @entity29
@entity29 said it was for a valid purpose to learn more about crossed eyes and lazy eyes
