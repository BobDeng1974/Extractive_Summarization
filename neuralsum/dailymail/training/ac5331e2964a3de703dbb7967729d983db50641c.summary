' i would n't change it , even if i could , i 've still walked away with £ 9,000 so i 'm a very lucky man			2
i would never back against @entity4			2
if i thought that they were going to lose i just would not place a bet			0
' he added : ' i thought it was a fair game , it 's just the same old scenario - losing to a southern hemisphere side			2
