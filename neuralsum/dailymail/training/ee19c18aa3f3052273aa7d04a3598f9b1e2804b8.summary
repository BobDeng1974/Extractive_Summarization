by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 will pull on the same shirt once occupied by some iconic names when he returns from his ban to take the field for @entity6			1
@entity7 departing to @entity8 left the @entity9 9 vacant only for a day			1
@entity1 wore the no 7 at @entity11 but adopts the premier striker ’s shirt at the @entity14 ; whether @entity15 and @entity16 will allow him that position on the pitch is another matter			1
@entity1 follows in illustrious steps : @entity21 ( @entity6 1996 - 97 ) the phenomenon at his best			1
in one season aged 20 @entity21 made himself a hero in @entity25 , scoring 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions including the winner in the @entity30 ’ @entity30 final under @entity32			2
samba star : @entity21 lit up @entity34 well before his days as a @entity36 striker his pace , touch and finishing was like no other and one goal against @entity41 is worthy of its own highlights reel			1
during the season he became the youngest @entity44			0
@entity45 ( 1998 - 2004 ) brought in by @entity47 as part of his @entity50 revolution , @entity46 was one of @entity51 ’s most sought after strikers having scored the winning goal in the @entity55 final with @entity56			2
@entity50 of class : @entity45 became one of @entity51 's most sought out strikers after winning the @entity55 with @entity56 he turned down the advances of @entity61 and struck up a dynamic partnership with @entity63 , winning @entity34 in his first season			0
in all he scored 120 goals in 255 appearances			0
@entity67 ( 2004 - 2009 ) the most decorated no 9 of the lot			2
@entity67 paid immediate dividends , scoring 29 goals in all competitions as @entity6 won @entity34 in his debut season			1
salute : @entity67 's goals helped @entity6 to many trophies during his five - year spell the next year he won the @entity78 golden boot and was man - of - the - match in the @entity55 final victory over @entity8			1
he also scored in the 2009 win over @entity61 – his 129th goal in 201 games for the club – and completed the @entity85			0
@entity86 ( 2009 - 10 ) perhaps the only stellar no 9 to be deemed a flop , @entity86 nevertheless scored 21 goals in 45 appearances and won @entity34 , @entity30 , and the @entity90			1
could n't settle : @entity86 moved on after just one season in @entity34 but he was never settled and loathed @entity15 ’s influence , later saying very uncomplimentary things about manager @entity94			2
he spent a season on loan at @entity97 before signing permanently			0
@entity98 @entity1 becomes the fifth winner of the @entity100 to be signed by @entity6			1
the @entity101 scored 31 @entity103 goals for @entity11 last season to win the award jointly with @entity21			1
all have done pretty well			0
@entity106 , @entity107 , 41 goals 1977 - 78 in his first @entity34 season he scored 29 goals to top the charts in @entity78 and finish third top scorer in @entity51			0
he also shone in the victorious @entity113 final			0
handy work : @entity106 would help @entity6 to win the @entity113 @entity115 , @entity116 , 38 goals 1989 - 90 a club legend and one of the most iconic members of @entity121 ’s @entity6 , wining the @entity55 in 1992 and the @entity122 in 1994 as well as five @entity34 titles			0
@entity125 brute : @entity115 celebrates scoring for @entity6 against @entity61 in the @entity55 @entity126 , @entity127 , 35 goals 2000 - 01 the @entity128 joined @entity6 in 2004 on a free transfer and while not posting incredible scoring figures added a dimension to the team			2
he got 19 goals in 58 games and won two @entity34 titles and the @entity55			0
winning the big one : @entity126 ( right ) celebrates winning the @entity55 title in 2006 @entity137 , @entity8 , 30 goals 2003 - 04 the @entity139 also won the award in 2005 after scoring 25 goals for @entity8 before moving to the @entity14 in 2007 for £ 16million			1
