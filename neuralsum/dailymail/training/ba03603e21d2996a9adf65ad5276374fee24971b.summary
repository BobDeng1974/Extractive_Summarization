members of @entity1 , many of them military veterans who fought in @entity2 , pummeled the @entity4 administration on thursday for its 2011 troop withdrawal from the @entity7 country			0
they argued that leaving a detachment of @entity10 troops there would have prevented the @entity13 - related group @entity12 , the @entity12 , from steamrolling a murderous path from @entity15 to towns near @entity17			1
on wednesday the group took control of @entity19 , the hometown of former dictator @entity20			0
@entity12 militants have beheaded a crucified @entity2 who stand in the way of their push for a shariah - compliant state that stretches across sections of @entity27 and northern @entity2			2
' this is a desperate situation			0
it ’s moving quickly , ' @entity30 @entity29 sen. @entity29 said thursday			1
he sits on the @entity32			0
' it appears to me that the chickens are coming home to roost for the president ’s policy of not leaving anybody there to be a stabilizing force			1
' given past @entity10 sacrifices , ' he said , ' it 's devastating to see terrorist groups taking over large cities in @entity2 and marching to @entity17 – but not surprising			1
' ' the @entity73 does n’t seem much bothered by the chaos , ' he said , ' which impacts @entity10 national security interests			1
' ' when @entity12 captured @entity76 earlier this year , that should have been a wake - up call			2
' in january isil militants reclaimed @entity76 , a city west of @entity17 on the @entity79			0
@entity10 forces captured it in 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the @entity83			2
more than 100 @entity10 lives were lost			2
following a classified intelligence briefing on thursday , @entity86 sen. @entity85 told reporters that the terrorists overrunning @entity2 ' have as part of their agenda to attack out homeland			1
the next 9/11 is in the making			2
' the briefing , he said , ' scared the hell out of me			0
the worst is yet to come			0
' some military officials have told @entity99 that @entity12 is now the single biggest terror threat facing the @entity10 ' it makes you want to kill yourself , ' one senior @entity10 official said of @entity10 intelligence on the group that he saw during a may meeting in @entity106 , @entity107			1
thursday 's rhetorical high point , after president @entity4 assured @entity10 that he would n't ' rule out anything ' from his palette of military options , came when @entity113 sen. @entity51 took to the @entity32 floor to blast the president			1
just ' because the president of the @entity10 declares that a conflict is over , ' he said , it ' does not mean , in the eyes of the enemy , that it 's over			1
' ' could all this have been avoided ? ' he asked , after reading a three - minute - long description of @entity2 's devastation at @entity12 's hands			1
' the answer is absolutely yes			2
' ' if i sound angry it 's because i am angry			1
' @entity4 's pullout , he said , ' was driven by politics and not by our national security interests			1
' ' i believe that history will judge the president ’s leadership with the scorn and disdain that it deserves , ' he concluded , ' tossing papers onto a tabletop with disgust			1
should they have stayed ? @entity10 soldiers were in @entity2 until december 2011 , when president @entity4 triumphantly withdrew them and declared that the war was over @entity12 warlord @entity146 seized control of the @entity2 provincial capital of @entity19 just a day after gaining power in the country 's second biggest city @entity15 ' i do n't rule anything out ' : president @entity4 announced thursday that military options against @entity2 insurgents were on the table , but @entity29 wo n't give him credit for cleaning up his own mess @entity51 tied @entity2 's return to civil - war footing to @entity4 's decision to withdraw @entity10 > troops from @entity163 by the time he leaves office			1
' the @entity2 war did not end because the forces against @entity2 and within @entity2 were still undefeated , ' he boomed			0
' the conflict in @entity163 will not be over two years from now , in 2017 , when the final @entity10 is scheduled to leave @entity163			2
' ultimately , said @entity51 , ' it 's time the president got a new security team that knows what it is to succeed in conflict			1
' @entity32 chair @entity173 , a @entity59 @entity174 , insisted that senators ' should n’t knee jerk anything			0
' he blamed @entity17 , not the @entity4 @entity178 , for the failure to ink a bilateral security agreement that could have kept @entity10 troops in @entity2 past 2011			2
' the @entity2 government – a few years back , when they had a chance to sign an agreement that would keep some of our presence there , refused to do it , ' @entity173 said			0
' so we ’ve got to be very careful and thoughtful before we do anything			0
' the proposed 2012 - and - beyond agreement was never finalized – partly because @entity2 resisted giving @entity10 personnel immunity from @entity2 law , and partly because the @entity4 administration chose to withdraw instead of pressing the issue			2
@entity197 @entity196 sen. @entity196 , vice-chair of the @entity198 , ricocheted an @entity4 2012 campaign slogan back in the direction of the @entity201			1
' i hope this is a wakeup call for anyone who thinks @entity13 or @entity12 extremists are " on the run " , ' he said			1
@entity12 was known as ' @entity12 ' until early in 2014			2
@entity2 soldiers have stripped off their uniforms and fled by the thousands as @entity12 marches toward @entity17 , leaving entire provinces to the terrorist militants three of the 17 members of @entity1 who fought in @entity2 told @entity213 on thursday that the post-withdrawal resurgence of an @entity12 splinter group there cheapened the value of their service			2
' going out across the desert i remember the feelings that you have , wondering if you 're going to make it out alive , said @entity224 @entity223 rep. @entity223			1
' right now i wonder what that was all about			0
what was the point of all of that ? ' rep. @entity230 of @entity197 pointed a finger directly at president @entity4			1
' i think at this point the administration made a choice to cut and run , @entity230 told @entity213			1
' when @entity76 fell again , we knew this foreign policy had consequences			0
' @entity239 rep. @entity238 said maintaining close ties with @entity2 , instead of leaving only an embassy contingent there at the end of 2011 , would have brought the @entity10 ' another ally in the region			1
' ' i came home from @entity2 feeling that we liberated 25 million people , ' he said			0
but now the task falls to @entity2 citizens themselves to hold back @entity12 from taking @entity17 , and with it the rest of the country			0
the @entity4 administration has sent the @entity2 army everything from rifles to rockets , but much of that materiel is falling into @entity12 's hands as soldiers flee battlefields			1
' it seems to me that the @entity2 laid down a lot of the arms that we gave to them , ' @entity238 mused			0
' so that does n't seem to be the solution			0
' @entity269 @entity268 rep. @entity268 told @entity270 on thursday that @entity4 would be responsible for whatever happens in @entity2			0
' let 's be clear , ' he said			0
' the full withdraw in 2011 was a big mistake			0
we would not be facing this situation			0
' ' are airstrikes are going to be the panacea ? i do n't know , but we 're seeing what happens when nothing occurs : you 're going to have @entity17 , almost the size of @entity283 , in flames			0
