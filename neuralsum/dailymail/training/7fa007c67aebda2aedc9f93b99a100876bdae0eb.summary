@entity1 's booming drives helped him birdie both the 17th and 18th holes on @entity4 's @entity3 to win the @entity5 last sunday			1
but if you thought the @entity7 hit the ball a long way you 've seen nothing yet			0
former world long drive champion @entity11 has starred in a remarkable video produced by the @entity13 which shows just how easy those two holes can be ( providing you blast the ball around 450 yards off the tee )			1
yes , that 's right : 450 yards			0
@entity1 is one of the game 's biggest hitters but in the cold @entity20 air he could perhaps expect to send his best drives 320 yards down the fairway			1
@entity11 shows in this video how he can blast his tee shots well over 100 yards longer than arguably the best player in the world			2
scroll down to watch @entity11 's incredible drives ... and exploding watermelon trick big swing : @entity11 fires off a drive on the 18th tee at @entity4 's @entity3 i 've got the power : @entity11 also demonstrated his huge hitting ability by destroying a watermelon take splat : @entity11 's golf ball annihilates the fruit after his driver ( left ) makes contact with the ball the real @entity41 : @entity11 is a former world long drive champion and can hit the ball prodigious distances @entity11 can be seen playing both the 17th and 18th holes - the signature par - five , par - five finish at @entity4 - and setting up eagle chances with monstrous drives followed by easy wedge shots into the greens			1
such skills would have come in handy for the likes of @entity53 , who needed an eagle on the final hole on sunday to match @entity1 's eventual winning score			0
@entity11 's colossal power is also demonstrated as he drives his golf ball clean through a watermelon placed in front of the tee , exploding the fruit into smithereens			2
champion : @entity1 poses with the trophy after winning the @entity5 last week big bash : the @entity7 is a long hitter but even he needed to take a long iron into the 18th green you beau - tee : @entity1 hits his drive on the 17th hole - @entity4 's signature par - five - last sunday all of which begs the question : why is @entity11 not a tour player if he can make things looks so easy ? well , thankfully for @entity79 , golf is about more than just blasting the ball into oblivion			1
there 's also the small matter of iron play , chipping and putting to think about - not to mention bunkers - as well as being able to perform in front of a huge audience			0
but while @entity11 is not a good enough all - round player to match the likes of @entity1 , he can still have fun smashing his ball around the globe			1
long drive is a growing element of golf , earning popularity in the @entity98 in particular			2
at 6ft 4in and 19 stone , the 30 - year - old @entity11 is one of its highest profile names			0
it 's just a shame we do n't get to see his putts ...			0
