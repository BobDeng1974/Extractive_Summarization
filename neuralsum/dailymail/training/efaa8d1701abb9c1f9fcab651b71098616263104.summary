a woman with a beard that needs shaving twice a day has been trolled by someone who cruelly compared her to the bearded @entity4 winner @entity3			1
mother - of - two @entity5 , 32 , was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity8 ) at the age of 12			1
she suffers from excessive hair growth on her face as well as other areas because the condition affects the balance of hormones in her body			2
@entity5 has polycystic ovary syndrome which causes her to grow a beard which she shaves twice a day but she was left deeply hurt after she woke up on sunday morning to an anonymous @entity20 message containing a picture of bearded drag queen act @entity3 , saying : ‘ did you see yourself on television last night ? can you see the resemblance ? ’ ms @entity5 said she burst into tears when she saw the message and now does n’t want to leave her home due to fear of further abuse			1
she said : ‘ it hit me - it was more than a shock			2
when i saw it , i just felt like lying down and giving up			0
‘ i watched @entity4 on saturday night and i had turned my phone off			1
‘ when i turned it on on sunday morning i saw the message but by this time whoever sent it had blocked me so it does n’t say who it ’s from			2
after saturday 's @entity4 , ms @entity42 received a message on @entity20 comparing her to the competition 's drag queen winner , @entity3 , who has a beard ms @entity5 says that when she saw the message comparing her to @entity3 ( pictured ) she burst into tears and that she now does not want to leave her house @entity50 ( @entity8 ) is the main cause of excess hair in women			1
estimated to affect 10 to 15 per cent of women , @entity8 is when the ovaries do n’t work properly and are covered in small cysts			0
as a result , eggs are released erratically or not at all , causing irregular or missed periods , and often reduced fertility and acne			0
one of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones ( androgens ) , which leads to hair growth			2
however , sometimes women produce higher levels , or they may have normal levels , but their hair follicles are more sensitive to androgens			2
' if excess hair is due to a hormonal imbalance , then it tends to occur in areas such as the chin , upper lip , sideburns , chest and inner thighs , ' says dr @entity83 , an endocrinologist from @entity84 , @entity85 , with a special interest in excess hair			1
' these are areas of the skin that are more sensitive to testosterone			0
' the hair is also likely to be coarse and dark			2
' given the implications for fertility , women worried about excess hair should see their gp , advises @entity97 , professor of reproductive endocrinology at @entity98 , @entity85 and an endocrinologist at @entity100 ’s and @entity101 , @entity85			1
' there may be other problems to investigate , ' he suggests			0
' often , excess hair is a symptom of @entity8 , but it also can be indicative of less common , but potentially more serious , hormonal disorders , or tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland - the two parts of the body that produce testosterone			1
' many , if not most , @entity111 will take the problem seriously and refer to an endocrinologist if appropriate			0
' women should not be afraid to ask for a referral to a specialist			0
' ‘ to wake up to that was really hard			0
‘ it ’s an incredibly cruel thing to do , my family are really angry			0
i just wanted to curl up and disappear			0
’ ms @entity5 , who is in remission from cancer as well as suffering from @entity8 , says she believes the person who sent the message must know her			1
she believes the person who sent her the message was one of her @entity20 friends			1
she thinks the person blocked her as a friend after sending the message			2
if someone does this , their message will no longer show their name and profile picture , but will appear to have been sent by ' @entity20 user '			1
she said : ‘ i figure it has to be someone i know who is aware of my condition and that makes it even harder to understand			0
‘ i do a lot of singing and karaoke so i think that is another reason why they ’ve drawn a comparison between me and the @entity4 winner			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous because we do n’t even look alike			0
‘ i find it really upsetting that it ’s probably someone i see around the town			0
’ ms @entity5 , who spends more than £ 2,000 on razors every year , says it is not the first time she has suffered abuse			1
she said : ‘ as long as i can remember , i ’ve had people say horrible things to me			0
it ’s a constant struggle			0
‘ i think people do n’t understand the condition and so they have a go at me through ignorance			0
‘ it has made it so much harder to come to terms with it and a couple of years ago i even tried to commit suicide			0
‘ in the last year i ’ve come a long way and i ’ve grown in confidence but this has really set me back			0
‘ at the minute i do n’t want to leave the house because i ’m so worried people are laughing at me , but i have to go to work to provide for my kids			1
‘ my kids have even been bullied in the past because of my condition			0
ms @entity5 said : ' at the minute i do n't want to leave the house because i 'm so worried people are laughing at me but i have to go to work to provide for my kids ' ms @entity5 is trying to raise enough money to pay for laser hair removal treatment ‘ i ’ve been learning to accept myself for who i am but this just shows how little people understand my illness			1
‘ people should judge a person by who they are , not what they look like			0
ms @entity5 believes the person who sent her the message was one of her @entity20 friends			1
she thinks the person blocked her as a friend after sending the message			2
if someone does this , their message will no longer show their name and profile picture , but will appear to have been sent by ' @entity20 user '			1
‘ the person who sent this is real scum and they need to grow up and get a life , it ’s just ignorant and shameful			0
’ ms @entity5 , a shop assistant from @entity209 , @entity210 , has constantly campaigned for treatment for herself and others whose lives are blighted by the condition			2
she is currently saving towards the £ 10,000 needed for laser treatment at a private clinic to remove the excess hair			1
ms @entity5 set up the inspiration foundation forum and support group on @entity20 , which currently has 7,000 girls and women with @entity8 as members			1
bearded drag act @entity3 , who secured @entity225 ’s first @entity4 win in 48 years , pledged to promote tolerance as she received a jubilant welcome home to @entity228 on sunday			1
the singer , whose real name is @entity3 , was greeted at the airport by more than 1,000 fans , some wearing painted beards and singing the winning anthem rise like a @entity235 .			2
