mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity26 , the @entity4 mp for @entity25 , vehemently deny that they sold the house of mrs @entity6 ’s mother to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £ 26,000 - a - year cost of her local authority nursing home			1
the couple , under investigation by police for nearly a year , said they would fight to prove their innocence			1
but they are well aware that , if charged and found guilty , they face personal and political ruin			1
‘ it ’s an absolute nightmare			1
it ’s killing us both , ’ revealed mrs bone			1
she also said her 81 - year - old mother would not be able to cope if they were jailed and she felt ‘ violated ’ by a police search of their home , which was ‘ like a scene from @entity49 ’			1
she claimed police tried to ‘ bully ’ them into acquiescing to the council ’s demand that they pay back the costs for her mother ’s care			1
mr @entity58 claimed he was targeted by police after defending former cabinet minister @entity59 over the ‘ @entity61 ’ affair			2
the mp , who has demanded ‘ zero tolerance ’ of crime , said : ‘ if it was true , i ’m a complete crook and should be locked up and the keys thrown away			1
but it ’s not true			2
’ he also claimed political enemies had conspired with police to smear him			2
until last week , mr @entity58 , 61 , was known at @entity68 chiefly for his jocular habit of referring to his wife during questions to @entity72			2
it prompted the prime minister to quip : ‘ a very big part of my life is trying to give pleasure to @entity58			2
’ but the couple were in a mirthless mood when they spoke to @entity19 on thursday			1
the police are investigating the sale of the £ 130,000 @entity84 home of mrs @entity6 ’s mother , @entity85 , seven years ago , before she moved into care			1

they deny they sold mrs @entity6 's mother 's house to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £ 26,000 - a - year costs for @entity95 the bones admit a large chunk of the money from the sale was used to pay off their debts , which they say built up when mr @entity58 took time off to look after their son , @entity101 , 13 , when mrs @entity6 had cancer			1
they say mrs @entity85 gave her permission and they intended her to move in with them , but she changed her mind			1
they deny owing the council around £ 100,000 in care costs – or doing anything wrong			1
mrs @entity6 , who earns £ 45,000 - a - year as her husband ’s office manager , says the ordeal has taken a toll on her health			1
‘ in the last three weeks they found a lump on my breast			1
i ’m convinced it ’s the stress			0
‘ it ’s ridiculous to think @entity26 would do something wrong and imply i have gone against my mum ’s wishes			1
’ her mother was feeling the strain too			2
‘ she knows it could be really bad for all of us			0
she thinks it ’s wicked			0
in the worst - case scenario , if we were charged , convicted , whatever , i ’m her only lifeline			2
otherwise , she ’s stuck in there 24/7			0
’ mrs @entity6 ’s desperation is clear			1
and it is shocking to hear the language used by the @entity96 , traditional @entity137 , about the police			0
‘ we have always been very supportive of them , ’ said mrs bone			2
’ she falters as she recalls the day they raided their home in @entity144 , @entity145			2
‘ it was like being burgled			0
i wo n’t ever forget			0
a knock on the door and			0
i could n’t stop shaking			0
mr @entity58 and his wife have vowed to clear their names ‘ i feel violated by that day			2
i relive it every single day			0
it ’s something that you see on the telly			0
mr @entity58 ’s sense of betrayal is just as deep			0
‘ i thought the police were great people who could n’t do anything wrong			0
some would say they lied to us			0
they raided our house and took our papers			2
we ’ve only just got them back			0
‘ they promised they would not see @entity85 without telling us first			0
they went and video - taped her in the home			1
she had no representation , without any notice – and they refused to give her a copy of the tape			0
’ mrs @entity6 ’s simmering rage surfaces when asked about rumours that her husband will be kicked out of the @entity4 if the police charge them			1
‘ i ’ll be damned if they force him			0
he ’s done nothing wrong , ’ she said , close to tears			0
her husband links the police action to his support for mr @entity59 , who was accused of calling a policeman a ‘ f * * * ing pleb ’ outside no 10			1
‘ i went on @entity186 and spoke up for him against the @entity187			0
you could put one and one together and make two – this was them getting back at me for that			0
’ but his main concern is for his wife			0
