dive - bomb : a woman cowers under attack in @entity23 , @entity24 threatening : the attacks have become so vicious that @entity8 has stopped delivering there blitz : the gulls are currently nesting and it is believed their aggression comes from protecting their young @entity8 has now ruled the gulls are a health and safety risk and have told residents at @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity35 , to collect their letters from a nearby post office			1
but homeowners say they have had to put up with the seagull blitz themselves for years and want mail staff to start delivering again			2

we have to put up with the seagulls so why ca n’t they ? they should man up , buy a hard helmet and deal with it			1
' ordinary cul - de - sac : apart from the vicious seagulls @entity23 is just like any other quiet street @entity8 declared the street off - limits after a postwoman came under repeated attack from the birds			1

' they are protecting their chicks and attack people in packs , swooping down , targeting people ’s heads			0
on the look out : the brightly - coloured uniforms of the @entity8 could be making the gulls even more agitated ' they go berserk when they see bright colours which is why i think they ’ve gone for the postwoman because she wears red			1
