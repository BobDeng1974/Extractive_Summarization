the dog is flat on his back , trussed up with a rough rope , his paws scrabbling frantically in the air as a man in a red baseball cap rams a needle deep into his heart			2
there is one last desperate struggle then a monstrous howl that rips through the muggy tropical morning , startling nearby market traders and silencing the birds			2
when the howl splutters into a whimper , the dog is dragged and kicked into a kennel to die alongside three others			2
it is a slow and painful death , the result of a botched lethal injection by a canine - killing squad			1
squalid : a dog jumps up looking for its owner			2
he is on death row at the dog pound in @entity28 , @entity29			1
eighty per cent of the dogs caught and killed are pet dogs not strays and it takes place in the so - called tropical paradise of @entity29 — the palm - fringed holiday destination of more than 200,000 @entity36 each year			1
away from the white , gleaming beaches — where the sea is impossibly blue and tourists sip cocktails while lazing on luxury sunbeds — more than 20,000 pet and stray dogs are slayed annually in this sickening way			1
these horrific images of the slaughter were taken during an undercover investigation by the @entity48 after the alarm was raised by the @entity36 - based charity @entity50			1
the @entity29 government claims it is a humane way of controlling the island ’s stray dog population , but it is neither humane nor honest			1
cruel : an @entity57 dog catcher nets a dog before throwing it into the van where it will be taken off to the pound death sentence : when it arrives at the pound the dog has three days before it is thrown into a mass grave at the grave yard in @entity28 some of the animals are strays but many more — up to 80 per cent — are much - loved pets that have been snatched from their doorsteps , with collars and security tags clearly marking their addresses			1
they are captured as part of a ‘ clean - up ’ campaign , despite pleas from animal welfare organisations across the world			1
and they are killed by an organisation with a name so ironic it would be laughable it was n’t true — the @entity88			0
kitted out in jaunty red caps and wielding giant fishing nets , @entity57 dog - catchers snatch animals wherever they see them — sleeping on street corners , lingering in alleys or lazing on their own doorsteps			1
they are scooped up and hurled into cages in the back of roasting - hot vans where they remain — often bleeding and with broken bones — while the officers continue their rounds			1
caged : @entity57 personnel march around in heavy boots , brandishing sharp metal rods to punish disobedient animals			0
in the filthy concrete cages , most of the dogs shrink to the back , shivering and terrified their destination is a pound that can only be described as a concentration camp for @entity116 personnel march around in heavy boots , brandishing sharp metal rods to punish disobedient animals			1
in the filthy concrete cages , most of the dogs shrink to the back , shivering and terrified			1
others edge forward , hopeful and trusting , unable to understand their predicament			0
the worst corner is the puppy cage — rusty , squalid with faeces , and utterly desolate			0
only animals with owners have any hope , and even then it is slim			0
if residents suspect their pet has been snatched by the @entity57 , they can come to the pound and pay a ransom to rescue it			1
but the charge is £ 30 , which is beyond the reach of most people , as the average worker earns less than £ 60 a month			0
nearly all the dogs spend three days in the cages before a lethal injection and a slow , painful death			1
the still - warm bodies are hurled into a mass open grave in a stretch of wasteland			1
clumps of fur , tails and ears are visible in the red soil			0
skulls and bones create splashes of white			0
the @entity57 insists only stray dogs are exterminated but this is a lie			1
the truth is that the organisation has a quota of more than 100 stray dogs to capture every day in a bid to reduce the island ’s estimated 200,000 population			1
helpless : the worst corner is the puppy cage - rusty , squalid with faeces , and utterly desolate			2
only animals with owners have any hope , and even then it is slim and officers will happily take pets to achieve this figure			2
@entity36 woman @entity175 can testify to this , after her two dogs were snatched while she was walking them			1
@entity175 , who is staying in @entity29 for nine months to visit a friend , adopted two stray dogs — whom she called @entity181 and @entity182 — on the waterfront near @entity184 in the north - east			1
she recalls : ‘ i was with them on the beach in december , throwing sticks , just having a nice day , when these two guys ran down with their nets and threw them over @entity181 and @entity182			0
‘ i screamed , “ what are you doing ! these are my dogs ! ” @entity181 and @entity182 could not have been more than 4ft away from me			2
but one of the dog - catchers said i was breaking the law : because they were n’t on a leash , they were strays , and that was that			2
’ @entity175 , from @entity202 , @entity203 , adds : ‘ i was in tears and ran after them and saw them dumped in the van like trash			0
@entity181 ’s leg was cut — you can see the scars and she has a limp now			0
‘ i followed the van in my car for the rest of the morning while the men scooped up pet after pet then went to the pound where they were unloaded			2
‘ i had to pay to get my dogs back			2
@entity182 will never be the same again — she was severely traumatised by the experience			0
’ @entity220 , a @entity36 expat living in @entity29 , lost her pet dog in january and went to the @entity57 compound to try to find him			1
lucky ones : @entity175 ( 35 ) from @entity225 with her two dogs @entity182 ( left ) and @entity181 ( right ) who she saved from the dog pound after the dog catchers snatched her pets from the beach			1
her search was unsuccessful — and shocking			0
she said : ‘ what i saw was horrific			0
there were so many beautiful dogs , many , many with collars , including puppies , squeezed into dirty kennel chambers covered with urine and faeces			2
‘ they were trembling , whining , and terrified			0
there was just one bowl of bread and water in each kennel			0
’ while the population of strays is undoubtedly large and growing , the dogs are not dangerous : there is no rabies on @entity29 , and the strays shun human contact			1
local and international vets agree that sterilisation would stem the problem — indeed , three years ago @entity258 actress @entity257 offered to pay for a mass sterilisation for all the island ’s strays			0
but the government will not consider it			0
yesterday , phone calls to the @entity57 were not returned			0
@entity266 vet @entity265 , who had to rescue her own dog from a pound , said : sterilisation is the way forward but no one will listen			0
’ she claims people on the island wo n’t criticise the @entity57 for fear of veiled retribution			0
foreigners worry about losing residency and work permits , and locals are vulnerable to arrest if they defame the government			0
authorities say the strays are an eyesore and jeopardise the lucrative tourism trade			0
but as one @entity291 vet who used to work on the island points out : ‘ for most tourists , these dogs are less dangerous than sunburn			2

more than 20,000 pet and stray dogs are *brutally* slayed annually in @entity29
undercover investigation after alarm raised by the @entity36 - based charity
up to 80 per cent are much - loved pets snatched from doorsteps
@entity304 can only be described as a concentration camp for dogs
