@entity0 wants @entity2 manager @entity1 to throw caution to the wind at the @entity6 finals and adopt @entity8 ’s cavalier style			1
the @entity10 legend believes @entity1 should pick up to five players from his @entity13 contingent to avoid a repeat of the turgid performances @entity2 produced under @entity16 in @entity17 four years ago			1
@entity8 lost out to @entity18 in the @entity20 title race on the last day of the season but were widely praised for their attacking style			2
that means certainly four and possibly five @entity8 players starting against @entity45 on june 14			1
‘ @entity17 in 2010 was so negative , with boring draws			0
@entity2 fans , and myself as an @entity2 fan , would rather three - all games than dull 0 - 0 draws			2
i ’d love to see @entity1 be brave enough to play like @entity8			1
the thing i admired most was the swagger of their play and how they terrorised opponents			0
it reminded me of @entity10 at their best			2
‘ the reports i ’m hearing now from the international set - up are very positive and while i still doubt @entity1 will start with such an attacking , @entity8 - style approach , i ’d love to see it			1
middle men : @entity65 would like to see @entity66 and @entity67 play in midfield for @entity2 @entity69 does it : @entity66 celebrates scoring the goal to send @entity2 to the @entity6 ‘ much has been said already about the @entity73 and @entity23 partnership for the club			1
but @entity66 , @entity23 and @entity31 can offer a huge goal threat for @entity2			1
on the back of last season , i ’d definitely start with @entity66 , @entity23 , @entity67 and @entity31			1
the question mark is @entity79 at right back			0
‘ it ’s probably @entity81 ’ best position , even though he could still develop into a great centre half			0
@entity79 is a touch better going forward , but it ’s a tight call			0
‘ @entity67 is a diamond of a lad who ’s best described as workmanlike			2
he ’s a player others appreciate having around them on the pitch			0
he ’ll sacrifice himself for the attacking talent			0
’ mistake : @entity0 says @entity1 was wrong not to pick @entity91 driving force : @entity0 says @entity2 have made a mistake not choosing @entity91 ( left ) , who has instead been going to events such as the @entity96 and meeting the likes of @entity98 however , @entity0 fears @entity1 may have blundered by not including his old @entity10 team - mate @entity91 in the squad to play the ‘ quarterback ’ role if @entity66 suffers an injury			1
‘ not bringing @entity91 is a mistake , ’ he said			2
‘ if there ’s an injury to @entity66 nobody jumps out to replace him			0
i do n’t see @entity67 , @entity109 or @entity110 playing @entity66 ’s role			1
i ’m not sure @entity109 has the ability to control a game			0
he ’s always someone who ’s up trying to score goals			0
@entity2 ’s success in the group hinges on @entity66 staying fit			1
’ in his blog for bookmaker @entity118 , @entity0 also described @entity121 ’s unhappiness at @entity18 over what the @entity123 star perceived as the club ’s failure to respect his 31st birthday as ‘ comical ’ and ‘ quite embarrassing ’			0
he added : ‘ i ca n’t remember @entity10 players acting like this			2
@entity130 , maybe the big lad just needs a cuddle			0

former @entity10 midfielder urges @entity1 to play five @entity8 players in starting xi
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity79 , @entity23 and @entity31 should all start in @entity42
@entity0 calls @entity67 ' a diamond ' and says he could be vital
@entity0 wants @entity2 to *progress* from the negative *football* they played four years ago
dropping @entity91 was a mistake , according to the @entity146 man
