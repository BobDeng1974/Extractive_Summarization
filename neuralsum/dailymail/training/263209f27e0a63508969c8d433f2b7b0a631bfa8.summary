' i have n't played all that much at the club so far but i 'm just looking to play as many games as i can before the end of the season and hopefully have a good summer , keep myself in good shape and come back to hit the ground running in pre-season , ' he told evertontv			1
' it 's getting into that rhythm of playing 90 minutes every week and getting up to the tempo of the @entity42			1
' hopefully that 's what i 'll do next season			2
the aim for me is to be in the starting xi in the first game			2
' i spoke to the manager ( @entity21 ) before we left and i said i wanted to carry on through the summer			2
' i had a break at @entity50 and he said i still need to give myself a rest from playing and running for a couple of weeks			2
