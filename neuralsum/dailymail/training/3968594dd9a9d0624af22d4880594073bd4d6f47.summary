by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 05:12 est , 8 march 2014 it is like @entity3 - but live			2
a @entity5 firm has released the first footage from a revolutionary satellite it is set to make available to the public			2
the footage shows planes landing at @entity11 airport in stunning detail , so that individual planes can easily be identified , while cars can be seen driving around the airport			1
the @entity25 was collected by @entity26 - 1 on february 14 , 2014 in other footage cars are seen moving on roads and vessels travelling through shipping lanes - all from a satellite positioned 600 kms above the planet			1
the video was taken by the @entity26 - 1 satellite and showcases high - resolution views of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 , @entity41			1
while it 's currently available for free , the group , @entity42 , plans to sell the footage to businesses in the near future			1
@entity26 - 1 , which was launched in november , captured up to 90 - second video clips at 30 frames per second to create the footage			1
the @entity49 group is now planning a constellation of 24 satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the @entity53			2
its larger goal is to sell what it can analyse about the global economy to companies , providing details such as supply chain monitoring and the movement of humanitarian aid			0
‘ the most revolutionary fact is that @entity64 was built and launched for more than an order of magnitude less cost than traditional sub-meter imaging satellites , ’ said @entity62 , chief executive of @entity42			2
satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution , but they weigh thousands of kilograms			0
@entity73 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites			0
the circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb			0
‘ their small size means we can afford to launch lots of satellites , and provide you lots of timely , sub-meter imagery and video , along with powerful derived analytics , ’ the group said on their website			0

the firm worked with @entity118 to create the @entity11 video			2
' this quick shot by @entity42 ’s @entity73 shows multiple planes landing at @entity122 ( @entity122 ) airport in @entity11 on december 30 , 2013 , ' said @entity118 's @entity124			1
' you can easily see a large plane landing on the runway at right			0
using the video ’s timestamp and public flight logs , @entity129 identified this plane as @entity135 flight 1310 , a wide - body @entity137 330 flying from @entity138 to @entity11			1
' operating as a codeshare , that flight was also listed as @entity140 1310 , @entity141 7564 , @entity142 9510 , @entity143 8010 and @entity144 7283			0
' the idea of video from space is very new but the benefit of seeing movement and direction over many frames is amazing			2
' seeing the aircraft headed to a specific terminal provided context to help identify it and watching cars move down a road shows directionality useful for better road classification			0
