by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 08:45 est , 15 january 2014 doctors were shocked when they x-rayed a woman ’s knees and found they were full of gold needles			1
the 65 - year - old @entity7 woman had hundreds of tiny acupuncture needles in her knee tissue			1
it is thought they were left around her joint intentionally by an alternative medical practitioner who was treating her for knee pain			2
a 65 - year - old @entity7 woman was found to have hundreds of gold needles in her knees ( pictured ) after acupuncture treatment for her osteoarthritis			1
it 's thought they were left there intentionally the woman had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis , @entity24 reports			2
osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and is characterised by inflammation of the affected joint , damage to the cartilage of the joint and bony growths around the edge of the joints			0
@entity35 can result from the damage to the cartilage which lines the bones and allows the joints to move without friction			0
the woman was treated with painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs but they failed to relieve the pain and they caused her stomach discomfort			1
as a result , she turned to acupuncture for relief and is believed to have sought treatment at least once a week			0
the therapy involves using needles to stimulate different parts of the body or to relieve pain			0
doctors say leaving the needles in the woman 's knees was not necessarily a good idea as they could cause inflammation , infections and abscesses			1
they also make interpreting x-rays hard ( file picture ) in the @entity7 woman ’s case , it is thought the needles were left inside her knees to provide continued stimulation after the treatment had ended			1
however , many experts believe leaving foreign objects inside a person ’s body is not a good idea			0
dr @entity80 , a professor of radiology at @entity82 , who was not involved in the woman ’s treatment , said they could cause swelling , abscesses and infections			2
he told @entity24 that leaving the needles in her knee could make it difficult for doctors to interpret x-rays			2
additionally , he said it would mean she could not have an @entity96 if needed because the magnets in the scanner could cause the needles to move and damage an artery			0
the woman ’s case was reported in the @entity102 .			0

the @entity7 woman , 65 , turned to acupuncture for relief after painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs failed to reduce her pain
it is thought the needles were left inside her knees intentionally
they could have been left there to ' provide continuing stimulation '
doctors say this is not *advisable* as the needles could cause swelling , infections or abscesses - they also make interpreting x-rays difficult
