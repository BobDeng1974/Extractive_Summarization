his family claim he is @entity13 because his father has been granted @entity13 citizenship			1
he is being held with @entity7 because the authorities claim he is a muslim and will not release him into the care of a @entity4 mr @entity14 told @entity36 : ' they kept a chain on her legs			1
she is very unhappy about that			0
' he said that he had initially been refused permission to see his daughter , but authorities eventually let him in to the prison - and his wife was momentarily freed from her chains			1
mr @entity14 was then able to hold his daughter @entity24 for the first time after she was born five days early in the hospital wing at @entity54 in @entity55 yesterday			1
@entity7 has spent the past four months shackled to the floor in a disease - ridden jail after being sentenced to death by hanging earlier this month for converting from @entity59 to @entity60 and marrying a @entity4 man			1
her lawyer @entity62 said the couple are ' happy and proud ' of their new arrival and that it has brought a momentary ray of light to an otherwise bleak and desperate situation			0

@entity14 is delighted that he is able to see his new daughter so soon			2
' the family are taking some time to enjoy the birth before they return to fighting the injustice of @entity7 's sentence			1
' @entity14 , a 27 - year - old biochemist who lives in @entity22 , @entity23 , also got the chance to hold his 20 - month - old son @entity27 , who is being held in the barbaric prison with his mother			1
the photo is especially poignant as @entity7 will never see her beautiful daughter grow up			1
she is set to hang sometime in the next two years as the authorities said she will be executed when she has finished weaning @entity84			0
and before the birth , @entity7 made the defiant claim that she would rather die than give up her faith			1

’ loving : @entity7 and @entity14 married in @entity10			1
@entity14 left @entity23 to visit her in @entity10 and arrange for his wife and son to join him in @entity13 when she was arrested an @entity59 @entity100 judge said she could be spared the death penalty if she publicly renounced her faith and becomes a @entity103 once more			1
@entity7 insists she has always been a @entity4 and told her husband she could not ' pretend to be a muslim ' just to spare her life			1
she told him : ' i refuse to change			0
i am not giving up @entity60 just so that i can live			2
' i know i could stay alive by becoming a muslim and i would be able to look after our family , but i need to be true to myself			0
’ @entity14 revealed his wife ’s defiant stance during an exclusive interview with @entity113 at his modest home in the @entity2 capital , @entity55			1
sitting beneath glamorous photographs of his wife taken at their wedding in december 2011 , he said : ' my wife is very , very strong			0
she is stronger than me			0
' when they sentenced her to death i broke down and tears were streaming down my eyes			2
our lawyers were passing me tissues			0
' she did not flinch when she was sentenced			0
it was amazing to see , particularly because she is the one facing the death penalty			0
’ @entity14 was in @entity55 trying to arrange for @entity131 and their 20 - month - old son , @entity27 , to live with him in the @entity13 when his wife was arrested in september			1
she was three weeks pregnant with their second child			0
the authorities will not release @entity27 into the care of his father because they claim he is a muslim too			0
bleak : the @entity141 in @entity55 , @entity10 where @entity7 is being held			1
it is overcrowded and riven with disease she spends much of her time shackled to the floor , is not receiving much nutrition in her food and is rarely allowed outside			1
both she and her bewildered son have contracted various illnesses because of the poor sanitation at the jail			0
a report by @entity153 claims the prison is ' beset with overcrowding ’ and suffers from ' poor sanitation , disease and the deaths of many children living with their mothers ’			0
@entity14 , who is originally from @entity10 , but is now a naturalized @entity13 , was initially refused permission to visit her			1
@entity14 told @entity113 : ' they say the marriage is void			1
now , even my wife is no longer my wife			0
and my son is not mine and my new daughter is not mine			0
they say i am a stranger to them			0
' i know my wife puts on a brave face but i can tell that she is in quite a bit of pain			0
she does n’t get to leave the room for weeks			0
' she has suffered medical complications while in jail , but no one knows the full extent of what they are because she is in prison			0
it ’s a difficult time			0
to see her walking in chains is difficult			0
’ @entity14 , who is wheelchair - bound because he suffers from muscular dystrophy , cuts a forlorn figure as he wheels himself around his empty house			1
his child ’s bed lies unused , as does a child - sized toothbrush			0
@entity14 keeps himself busy by studying the regular barrage of paperwork that his legal team send him			2
like many in @entity10 , both @entity14 and his wife ’s childhood were blighted by civil war			2
@entity14 managed to escape the brutal conflict in 1998 when he travelled to @entity13 with his brother @entity200			1
the biochemist returned to @entity10 to marry @entity7 at a @entity4 service in a chapel which was attended by around 500 people in december 2011			1
most who were at the wedding ceremony could vouch for the pair being committed @entity4 , defence lawyers say			2
but witnesses who were willing to give evidence on her behalf were barred from testifying because they were @entity4			2
she even produced a marriage certificate identifying herself as a @entity4			2
despite this , the judge determined that because her father was a muslim , even though he abandoned the family while they were living in a refugee camp in the @entity219 when she was six , she too was a muslim who had broken the law by leaving @entity59			1
but her mother , who is now dead , brought her up as @entity4			2
her mother was born in @entity224 to @entity4 parents , but fled to @entity10 because of famine , and chose to raise her daughter in the same religion			2
@entity7 was arrested in mid-september , three weeks after her second child was conceived			2
at first the couple dismissed the allegations against them as trivial , but when the case grew more serious @entity14 went to the @entity234 in @entity55 for help			1
' i thought this would be the one place which would help me , but they told me they did n’t have time to do anything , ’ @entity14 said			1
' i was upset because now that i am @entity13 citizen i thought they would help me			1
they said “ well your wife is n’t @entity13 , so we ca n’t help ”			2
my home is in @entity13 and still they wo n’t help			2
it ’s getting uglier and it ’s not going in the right direction			0
’ mr @entity14 said the @entity252 asked him to provide dna evidence proving that @entity27 was his biological son			2
rotten care : @entity27 is given a drink by prison guards			0
@entity14 is desperate to be allowed to take him home and is fiercely critical of the @entity13 embassy for failing to help them and @entity27 in particular , who is @entity13 he added : ' i have provided wedding documents and the baby ’s birth certificate , but this is clearly not enough			1
it ’s very upsetting that they do n’t believe me			0
' they want me to take a dna sample in @entity55 , then send it to the @entity13 for testing			1
it ’s as if they do n’t believe a word i say			0
’ the @entity100 court has postponed her sentence , to give her time to recover from childbirth and to wean the new baby			0
her lawyer , @entity62 , a muslim , has received death threats for defending her but has already lodged an appeal			2
if he does not succeed at the @entity283 , he will take the case to @entity10 ’s @entity285			0
mr @entity62 said the case hinges around the testimony of two men who claim to be her brothers , and one woman who claims to be her mother			0
in court they claimed that she had disappeared from the family home in a small village in the east of @entity10 and then discovered her living in @entity55 , married to a @entity4 man			1
but the lawyer said all three witnesses have proven to be liars because their evidence to the court has been highly contradictory			0
he suggested that the trio are making up their story in an attempt to claim ownership of @entity131 ’s flourishing general store in a shopping mall on the outskirts of @entity55			2
mr @entity62 added : ' we can prove that @entity7 ’s mother died in 2012 and that the two others are definite fraudsters			2
but the court is not interested in our evidence			0
’ a petition calling for her release had last week reached more than 661,000 .			0
