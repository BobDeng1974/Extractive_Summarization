when president @entity1 dined with a dozen technology business leaders in @entity3 four years ago , it was @entity5 executive chairman @entity4 who sat at the head of the table			1
@entity1 sat on one side , between the late @entity10 co-founder @entity9 and @entity13 pioneer @entity11 , but the place of honor was no accident			0
@entity5 executives and employees donated more than $ 1.6 million to @entity1 's two @entity20 campaigns , and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both			1
one result has been a coziness with the @entity28 government 's executive branch that few other companies can match – marked by access for lobbyists , mentions in nearly half of @entity1 's @entity33 addresses , and a personnel feeder trough serving the @entity20 with new senior hires			1
beginning : in 2007 @entity1 had an on - stage cameo with @entity5 's then - ceo @entity4 as part of a presidential candidate series influence : @entity4 ( far left ) shared the head of the table with the spouse of a venture capitalist whose firm owned 20 per cent of @entity5 , as president @entity1 dined with tech leaders in 2011 there have even been allegations that @entity5 's up - close - and - personal relationship with the @entity51 earned it a reprieve from what would have been an earth - shaking @entity55 antitrust lawsuit			1
@entity5 has insisted it never received special treatment in that case , punctuating its denials with an @entity60 of a laughing baby as a jab at the news outlet that leveled the charge			0
@entity20 visitor logs suggest a different kind of story for the company whose motto is ' do n't be evil			2
' employees of the @entity73 behemoth have been in the @entity20 more than 230 times since @entity1 took office – approximately once per week			1
at least 190 of those meetings were with senior officials			0
more than 60 featured @entity5 lobbyist @entity78			0
overall , according to @entity79 , @entity5 spent $ 16.8 million on lobbying last year			2
that 's four times the amount spent by @entity10 , whose market capitalization is twice as big			0
it needed that muscle in 2011 , after the @entity55 found @entity5 allegedly manipulated search results in ways that favored its own for - profit products			1
@entity90 and @entity91 were among the companies who complained that @entity5 was engaging in practices that violated antitrust laws			2
the @entity79 reviewed emails showing that @entity5 co-founder @entity97 met directly with @entity55 officials in late 2012 to discuss a settlement			2
about the same time , @entity20 visitor logs show , @entity5 chairman @entity4 met with @entity1 senior adviser @entity101			1

@entity108 followed up with a meeting with @entity55 chairman @entity112			0
the government closed its investigation two months after @entity1 won re-election			0
@entity116 : @entity117 , director of product management , civic innovation and social impact at @entity5 , has become the @entity123 campaign 's top technology guru @entity5 agreed to change its business practices but dodged a potential 10 - figure fine – and saved the cost of litigating a years - long case that could have resulted in breaking up the company into smaller , more market - competitive units			1
both @entity5 and the @entity55 said at the time that there was no undue influence			2
@entity5 pilloried the @entity79 , which first suggested a link between the company 's access and the investigation 's outcome , saying the meetings its executives held with administration officials involved discussions about ' everything but ' the antitrust investigation			2
in a blog post , the company cited ' patent reform , @entity145 education , self - driving cars , mental health , advertising , internet censorship , smart contact lenses , civic innovation , r&d , cloud computing , trade and investment , cyber security , energy efficiency and our workplace benefit policies			0
' the written defense @entity5 published took specific aim at @entity79 publisher @entity164 , and included an @entity60 of a laughing baby in a high chair			0
but a @entity5 spokesperson confirmed thursday on background that company executives has talked with the @entity55 about unspecified antitrust concerns in the past			1
the spokesperson declined to be quoted or named			0
@entity4 is a one - man case study of the kinds of influence a multibillionare tech titan can wield in @entity176 when the stars align			0

' close down @entity199 , ' @entity1 replied , ' restore @entity200 , say no to @entity201 , no to warrantless wiretaps			0
' the exposure was vital : @entity1 ended up lapping the field in fundraising in the high - tech sector			0
@entity1 offered @entity4 his choice of cabinet slots after the 2012 election – either @entity209 – and was even prepared to create a new ' secretary of business ' position for him			1

when the future president visited his campaign headquarters on @entity225 in 2012 , @entity4 was there overseeing final efforts to leverage ' @entity227 ' to nudge last - minute voters to the polls			0
he was by then already a donor to @entity1 's @entity20 bids , contributing the maximum amount allowed by law both times			1

the company , the @entity20 says , will ' donate ten million hours of high - performance computing ' and help scientists to create ' early warning capabilities ' for climate change - related disasters and related risks for diseases			2
