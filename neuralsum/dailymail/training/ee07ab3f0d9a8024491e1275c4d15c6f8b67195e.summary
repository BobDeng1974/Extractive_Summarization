@entity0 has strenuously denied it played any role in the @entity3 's alleged efforts to hack the @entity4 , after it emerged that the spy agency had developed a system to hack into and monitor the devices			1
documents released on monday and published in @entity10 's @entity9 reveal that the @entity3 actively worked on software that enabled it to remotely access iphones and their text messages , photographs , contacts , location , voice mail and even their video			1
the report included an @entity3 graphic dated 2008 that outlined a system in development called @entity24 , described as a ' software implant ' that allows infiltrators to push and pull and retrieve data from @entity4 such as contact lists			1
@entity9 referred to it as a ' trojan , ' or malware that helps hackers get into protected systems			0
denials : @entity0 and their ceo @entity35 have strenuously denied any collusion with the @entity3 in a backdoor spying program aimed at users of @entity4 it is not clear where @entity9 acquired this information - however the magazine has worked with whistleblower @entity44 in the past			1
the report , which surfaced on sunday , did not suggest that @entity0 had cooperated with the @entity48 spying agency on so - called backdoors			2
the @entity51 , @entity52 - based , company said tuesday it had never worked with the @entity3 to deliberately weaken its products , promising that it would ' defend our customers from security attacks , regardless of who 's behind them			1
' in a statement issued tuesday , the @entity3 did not comment on any specific allegations but said that its interest ' in any given technology is driven by the use of that technology by foreign intelligence targets			2
' ' the @entity48 pursues its intelligence mission with care to ensure that innocent users of those same technologies are not affected , ' the agency added			0
the @entity4 was a relatively innovative gadget in 2008			0
it hit the market in 2007 and proceeded to help revolutionize the mobile phone industry			0
' @entity0 has never worked with the @entity3 to create a backdoor in any of our products , including @entity4			1
additionally , we have been unaware of this alleged @entity3 program targeting our products , ' the company said in a statement			2
' we will continue to use our resources to stay ahead of malicious hackers and defend our customers from security attacks , regardless of who 's behind them			1
' a backdoor is a hidden remote access from an outside source to the device ( stock image pictured ) that enables the hacker to have almost full access with little detection the controversial report could not have come at a worse time for @entity0 , which announced a deal earlier this month to sell iphones on @entity100 's network , thereby allowing the tech - giant to enter a market that has 700 million customers			1
obviously , any suggestion that @entity0 could be vulnerable to @entity48 government surveillance snooping could damage any such deal			0
according to @entity9 , the @entity3 's trojan program allows the intelligence agency to read text messages and listen to voicemails and had a 100 percent success rate on @entity113 devices			1
and on monday , journalist and security expert @entity114 revealed how exactly the @entity3 can turn your @entity4 into an eavesdropping tool			1
@entity114 used his slot at @entity120 's @entity119 for hackers , to pull back the curtain on the @entity3 's arsenal of high - tech spy gear including how it can use radar wave devices to harvest electronic information from computers , even if they are n't online			1
he told hundreds of computer experts at the conference that the @entity3 's capabilities ‘ are even worse than your worst nightmares			2
’ ‘ what i am going to show you today is wrist - slittingly depressing , ’ he said			0
the investigation followed earlier reports of the @entity3 ( headquarters pictured ) spying on @entity0 products , which suggested a ' backdoor ' in @entity113 could provide hackers with valuable information			1
@entity0 said at the time that it had never worked with the @entity3 to deliberately weaken its products even though in the past six months there have been an unprecedented level of public scrutiny of the @entity3 and its methods , @entity114 's claims - supported by what appeared to be internal @entity3 slideshows - still caused a stir			1
one of the slides described how the @entity3 can plant malicious software onto @entity0 's @entity4 , giving @entity48 intelligence agents the ability to turn the popular smartphone into a pocket - sized spy			1
‘ @entity0 has never worked with the @entity3 to create a backdoor in any of our products , including @entity4 , ’ the company said in a statement to @entity158			1
‘ additionally , we have been unaware of this alleged @entity3 program targeting our products			2
’ another slide showcased a futuristic - sounding device described as a ‘ portable continuous wave generator , ’ a remote - controlled device which - when paired with tiny electronic implants - can bounce invisible waves of energy off keyboards and monitors to see what is being typed , even if the target device is n't connected to the internet			0
a third slide showcased a piece of equipment called @entity179 , which can tamper with wireless internet connections from up to eight miles ( 13 kilometers ) away			0
an @entity3 spokeswoman , @entity181 , said that she was n't aware of @entity183 's presentation , but that in general should would not comment on ‘ alleged foreign intelligence activities			2
’ @entity114 told hundreds of computer experts gathered at @entity120 's @entity119 that his revelations about the @entity3 's capabilities ' are even worse than your worst nightmares ' ‘ as we 've said before , @entity3 's focus is on targeting the communications of valid foreign intelligence targets - not on collecting and exploiting a class of communications or services that would sweep up communications that are not of bona fide foreign intelligence interest to the @entity48 government			1
’ the documents included in @entity114 's presentation were first published by @entity10 magazine @entity9 on sunday and revealed details about the undercover work carried out for the @entity3 by an elite team of hackers known as @entity205 ( @entity205 )			1
@entity205 's mission is ‘ getting the ungettable , ’ and an unnamed intelligence official had said that @entity205 had gathered ‘ some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen			0
’ when agents with the @entity205 division want to infiltrate a network or a computer , they turn to their technical experts known as @entity217 ( @entity217 ) , which produces tools for penetrating network equipment and monitoring mobile phones and computers			0
@entity217 's products have helped @entity205 agents infiltrate networks and divert or even modify data wherever the @entity3 's usual methods are n't enough			2
@entity205 has a catalog of high - tech gadgets for hard - to - crack cases , including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen , usb sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves , and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go			0
@entity242 base stations , for example , make it possible to monitor mobile phones , such as that of @entity10 chancellor @entity246 in the catalog a rigged monitor cable , which allows ‘ @entity205 personnel to see what is displayed on the targeted monitor , ’ goes for $ 30			0
an ‘ active @entity242 base station ’ that makes it possible to mimic the cell phone tower of a target network and thus monitor mobile phones , is available for $ 40,000			0
computer bugging devices disguised as normal usb plugs , capable of sending and receiving data undetected via radio link , are available in packs of 50 , for over $ 1 million			0
these tools have n't just been used exclusively to track suspected terrorists			0
@entity242 base stations , for example , make it possible to monitor mobile phones , such as that belonging to @entity10 chancellor @entity246			0
radar systems such as the one known as @entity268 have also been used to spy on allies , for example @entity272 representatives in @entity273			0
and the hardware ' implants ' found in the @entity217 catalog evidently have been used to tap encrypted faxes			0
protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former @entity3 contractor @entity44 and with the world asylum on it during a march against the spying methods of the @entity48 in @entity120 , northern @entity10 on sunday the catalog is n't up to date and many of the software solutions on offer date from 2008			1
as a result some apply to server systems or mobile phone models that are no longer on the market			0
a @entity292 for gaining total access to @entity4 , which was still new at that time , was still in development , though its specifications were still listed in the catalog			0
one internal @entity3 document dating from 2004 describes a spyware program called @entity299 that it provides ' unique backdoor access to personal computers of targets of national interest , including but not limited to terrorist targets			2
' the @entity3 has also targeted products made by well - known @entity48 manufacturers and found ways to break into professional - grade routers and hardware firewalls , such as those used by internet and mobile phone operators			2
@entity217 offers malware and hardware to take advantages of weaknesses in computers made by some of the world 's leading information technology companies , including @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and @entity326 's @entity325 @entity114 and @entity9 have both played an important role in the disclosures of @entity3 leaker @entity44 , but neither has clarified whether the most recent set of slides came from @entity44 .			1

@entity0 denies that it colluded with the @entity3 to hack @entity4 as part of a huge spying program
the @entity51 - based company said tuesday it had never worked with the @entity3 to deliberately weaken its products , promising that it would ' defend our customers from security attacks , regardless of who 's behind them . '
the denials follow revelations in @entity10 's @entity9 magazine that the @entity3 produced software that enabled it to spy on @entity4
on monday security expert @entity114 has revealed that the @entity3 has the technology to turn your @entity4 into an eavesdropping device
