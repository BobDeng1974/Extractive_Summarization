president @entity0 and other top members of his administration have snubbed a historic rally in @entity4 today that brought together more than 40 world leaders from @entity7 , @entity8 , the @entity9 and even @entity10			1
' @entity11 is our oldest ally , ' @entity0 said during a speech friday in @entity15			2
' i want the people of @entity11 to know that the @entity18 stands with you today , stands with you tomorrow			1
' but he was n't standing in @entity4 as @entity22 prime minister @entity21 and @entity24 president @entity23 put aside their differences and linked arms			1
@entity29 president @entity28 and @entity10 foreign affairs minister @entity30 made the same unifying gesture in the march down the @entity33 in defiance of the @entity36 terror attacks that rocked the city last week			0
according to an administration official , president @entity0 spent part of his sunday afternoon watching a @entity42 game on television			2
both games were broadcast hours after the march			0
heads of state from every major @entity7 power , including @entity49 prime minister @entity48 and @entity51 chancellor @entity50 , joined @entity53 president @entity52			1
secretary of state @entity106 was a world away in @entity108 , on a pre-planned trip			0
attorney general @entity97 was in @entity4 for a terrorism summit held on the march 's sidelines , but he slipped away and made appearances on four @entity18 morning television talk shows just as the incredible rally was starting			1
the @entity18 was represented at the march only by @entity117 , the @entity18 ambassador to @entity11 who is unrecognizable to most @entity18 , let alone the rest of the world			1
a senior administration official was quick to point out , however , that ' attorney general holder – a @entity122 level official – is representing the @entity18 at the security meetings in @entity4 today			1
' ' he is joined by the @entity126 deputy secretary [ alejandro ] mayorkas , ' the official added in a statement to many news outlets			0
' the @entity18 is represented at the march by @entity131			0
' and ' as far as public signs of @entity53 solidarity from the @entity18 , ' the official concluded , ' do n't forget several public statements from the president , his call to @entity52 and a condolence stop to the @entity53 embassy			1
' @entity0 went to the @entity53 embassy in @entity103 on thurdsay to pay his respects , and signed a condolence book with the rallying cry ' @entity11 ! ' @entity97 , @entity0 's longest - serving cabinet member , was pictured shaking hands with @entity53 officials after the event , but he slipped away – as did @entity147 – before the march kicked off around 3:00 p.m. the attorney general appeared on four sunday morning talk shows around the same time as the march , although it 's unclear whether he spoke live from @entity4 or if his segments were pre-recorded			1
the @entity154 would not immediately comment on @entity97 's schedule with @entity156 , and a spokesperson for homeland security secretary @entity158 similarly did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
the @entity162 press office also did not respond to a question seeking confirmation that the president was engrossed in the @entity42 playoffs on sunday afternoon			0
vice president @entity102 often fills in for the president at events that require @entity162 gravitas , but he was nowhere to be seen either , despite his own empty schedule			2
among those who did attend were : @entity173 prime minister @entity172 , @entity175 prime minister @entity174 , @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , @entity83 prime minister @entity82 , @entity69 president @entity68 , @entity22 prime minister @entity21 , @entity72 president @entity71 , @entity51 chancellor @entity50 , @entity177 president @entity81 , @entity24 president @entity23 , @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity179 prime minister @entity178 , @entity181 prime minister @entity180 , @entity29 president @entity28 and @entity10 foreign affairs minister @entity30			1
@entity182 : an estimated 1.3million people gathered at @entity184 in @entity4 , @entity11 on sunday to demonstrate against the recent terrorist attack at the @entity187 offices which resulted in the death of more than a dozen people political opponents – and even some allies – were quick to criticize @entity0 for not showing up himself , or at least sending a senior administration official to represent him at the street - swelling rally			1
an incensed former speaker of the house @entity194 vented on @entity195 and told @entity156 that it was ' sad that 50 world leaders could show solidarity in @entity4 but president @entity0 refused to participate			1
' ' the cowardice continues , ' @entity199 jabbed , referring to @entity202 ' refrain that he has shown a weak hand when dealing with terrorism overseas			0
@entity207 reporter @entity206 tweeted : ' is it just me or does it feel like @entity0 should be at this big march in @entity4 ? ' @entity211 host @entity210 wrote : ' this is really embarrassing – where is president obama ? why did n't he go ? ' @entity0 's absence was notable as dozens of nations ' show of solidarity unfolded before a global audience – especially considering his public schedule was wide open			1
according to @entity222 , @entity97 left @entity4 after the summit to return to @entity103			2
meanwhile , secretary of state @entity106 was half a world away in @entity108 , preparing for the president 's upcoming trip to the south @entity228 country in the coming weeks			0
@entity229 : both president @entity0 and vice president @entity102 's schedules were free today , but neither flew to @entity4 for the historic march			1
pictured above in @entity233 , @entity15 on friday @entity234 : secretary of state @entity106 could not attend the rally because he was in @entity108 , preparing for president @entity0 's upcoming visit to the country			2
pictured above on sunday with @entity108 prime minister @entity239 protected : security was an orchestrated effort , but that fact that @entity22 prime minister @entity21 ( left ) joined shows how secure the dignitaries were			0
pictured above with @entity53 president @entity52 ( right ) during a ceremony at the @entity246 in @entity4 , following the march			2
mistake ? several political talking heads called president @entity0 's absence a ' mistake '			2
above , @entity24 president @entity23 ( center ) leaves the @entity253 to participate in the march @entity256 's @entity255 reported that security for the march was difficult , with 2,300 police officers and paramilitary forces deployed to @entity4			2
the foreign dignitaries were protected with police snipers , plainclothes cops and anti-terror officers			0
streets were shut down and parking was restricted			0
however , the attendance of controversial heads of state like @entity21 appeared to show that the march was well secured			0
' i do n't mean this as a criticism of the @entity0 administration , ' @entity255 said sunday while reporting live from @entity4 , ' but just as an @entity18 i do wish that we were better represented in this beautiful procession of world leaders			1
' ' i 'm a little disappointed , personally – this is me speaking personally , not as a representative of @entity256 , but as an @entity18 – that there is n't more of a display of unity here , ' the host of ' @entity279 ' added			0
@entity256 's @entity286 was one of the many who noticed president @entity0 's absence , and remarked that it was a mistake not to show up and support our ' deepest ideological ally			2
' @entity286 said that it would have sent an important message to have an @entity18 face among the wold leaders			0
@entity298 columnist @entity297 echoed @entity286 's statements , saying : ' by not attending the unity rally in @entity4 on sunday , president @entity0 has missed an opportunity to show leadership , to demonstrate that @entity18 are as committed to fight against terrorism as anyone in the world			1
' and that @entity18 stands with its allies in a worldwide battle that , unfortunately , is likely to last many years			0
' the @entity162 announced on sunday that it would convene ' a @entity309 ' in february ' to highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing , recruiting , or inspiring individuals or groups in the @entity18 and abroad to commit acts of violence			0
' a statement from @entity162 press secretary @entity318 made no specific mention of @entity320 , @entity36 terrorism , or @entity320 in general			0
support : @entity53 president @entity52 ( left ) and @entity51 chancellor @entity50 ( right ) stand side by side in the march on sunday			1

@entity51 chancellor @entity50 , @entity22 **pm** @entity21 and @entity49 **pm** @entity48 were among dozens of world leaders there
neither president @entity0 or vice president @entity102 attended the historic event , though both of their public schedules were open
@entity0 told the @entity53 on friday that ' the @entity18 stands with you today , stands with you tomorrow ' – but he did n't stand with them in @entity4
@entity18 attorney general @entity97 was in @entity4 for a terrorism summit on the march 's sidelines , but was not seen at the march that followed
no cabinet secretaries or other senior officials attended , leaving only @entity18 ambassador to @entity11 @entity117 as the top @entity18 official there
