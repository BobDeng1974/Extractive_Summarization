published : 08:54 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 09:32 est , 18 september 2012 freedoms gained during the @entity2 uprisings are being whittled away and fledgling democracies are now under threat , claims a @entity6 watchdog			1
the @entity7 published by @entity8 today , concludes that levels of democratic governance declined throughout the world last year			2
it found that gains made in the @entity14 and @entity15 after the uprising in @entity17 triggered a wave of protests across the region have notably declined			1
improvements made after @entity23 's president @entity22 , pictured here following his capture , was ousted have not lasted according to a new report only @entity26 has shown an improvement in its overall governance score amongst the @entity14 - @entity15 countries surveyed			1
@entity30 , one of the most stable states in the region , slipped backward , while @entity23 showed only a minor improvement			2
worldwide , declines in the quality of governance far exceeded improvements			0
the organisation judged levels of democracies by looking at government accountability and the rule of law in civil and criminal matters			0
the deterioration raises an alarm for pro-democracy advocates who had hoped the overthrow of brutal authoritarian regimes in @entity26 , @entity17 and @entity23 would lead to lasting democracy			1
@entity50 , project director , said : ' it is unclear whether the popular dismissal of the old models of authoritarianism will translate into enduring public support for novice representative government and contentious institutional reforms			0
' @entity26 has improved its democratic governance since president @entity60 @entity59 was overthrown ' there are limits to citizens ' patience with respect to political instability , economic disruption and physical insecurity , and the desire to return to a less chaotic environment may allow the leaders to slip back into the familiar habits of authoritarian rule			1
' @entity75 states place significant value on the findings of the report , using the results to help them decide if a developing can country would use foreign assistance effectively			2
the report covers the period from april 2009 to december 2011			2
four criteria were used to assess 72 countries in the survey - accountability and public voice ; civil liberties ; rule of law ; and anti-corruption and transparency			1
figures for half of the countries were updated each year , while @entity23 and @entity26 were surveyed for the past two years			1
@entity8 says a country score of five out of a total of seven is the minimum standard for effective democratic governance , which it views as essential to an open , just and prosperous society			0
in the latest report , @entity26 improved in all categories led by a sharp rise in accountability and public voice , pushing its overall country ranking to 4.11 from around 2.36 before the ouster of president @entity60 @entity59 in january 2011			1
one area of concern the report highlighted was women 's rights in @entity26 where it said @entity116 political parties have stoked fears that existing rights would be retracted			1
dictator colonel @entity119 who was overthrown on august 23 last year			0
there are concerns that countries such as @entity17 may return to authoritarian rule while it uses monitors and experts on the ground and an advisory board , such rankings can be controversial accused of imposing subjective and @entity131 viewpoints			2
levels of accountability and public voice rose in @entity23 after president @entity22 was ousted , but other areas did not show improvements leading to only a small rise in the country 's score to 2.25 from 1.98			0
restrictions on the media , hostility to non-governmental organizations and efforts to restrain women 's political activity through ' virginity checks ' by the military were cited as areas of concern			0
@entity30 , saw its measures decline across the board pulling its country average down to 2.03 , the level of pre-uprising @entity157 , from a recent peak of 3.27 in 2004			0
@entity23 celebrate after president @entity22 was ousted in june this year , but the claims that freedoms gained in @entity2 countries are being lost elsewhere , in @entity163 increases in violence and organised crime reduced scores in the countries surveyed			1
the trend included high rates of violence against journalists in @entity172 and @entity173 , and growing interference by organized crime in the electoral process in @entity177 and @entity172			0
@entity178 suffered major setbacks in the face of power grabs by the executive branch and ruling parties , particularly in @entity184 and @entity185			0
freedom of expression was also constricted as the @entity188 and @entity189 governments and others cracked down on the media			0
@entity192 , suffered score declines from the increasing dominance of the ruling @entity195 and the government 's efforts to limit media freedom			0
electoral abuses in @entity200 and @entity201 , in addition to growing corruption in @entity204 , were also responsible for significant score drops in @entity15 countries assessed in the latest report .			1

report says freedoms gained during @entity2 risings are *diminishing*
only @entity26 has shown an improvement amongst the @entity14 - @entity15 countries
