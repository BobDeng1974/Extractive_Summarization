if you settle down to watch television this evening , you might want to think twice about what you say out loud			0
@entity3 has warned owners of its internet - connected ‘ smart tv ’ that anything they discuss while sitting near the device may be overheard			1
the popular televisions are voice activated , so users can switch channels or ask for suggestions of what to watch simply by giving a verbal command			2
the @entity16 feature has to be enabled by the user , and they agree to let it track their conversations when they accept the tv 's terms and conditions			1
@entity3 said it sends voice commands , ' along with information about [ the ] device , including device identifiers ' to a third - party service however , the technology which allows this to happen has a worrying side effect : it records everything else that goes on near the television			1
a clause in the @entity38 firm ’s privacy policy warns : ‘ please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information , that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party			1
’ that means it could , for example , record a family argument going on in the living room			0
companies that use the televisions in boardrooms risk sharing confidential information such as employees ’ salaries or business strategies			0
privacy campaigners drew comparisons between the @entity59 and ‘ @entity60 ’ – the authoritarian state which watches people ’s every move in 1984 , the dystopian novel by @entity65			1
@entity66 , of @entity67 , a campaign group named after this very notion , said : ‘ this thing is going to be in your house , listening in on you			0
‘ @entity3 say they are providing you with a service , but really the only service you need from a television is to watch programmes			0
’ more than half of smart tvs sold in @entity80 are made by @entity3			1
the company says its televisions constantly listen out for simple commands to switch on or change channel , which are interpreted by the machine itself			0
however , it can only process more complicated requests by recording users ’ speech and sending it to a third - party company called @entity93 , in the @entity94			2
that firm then sends the data to a computer server , which translates it into text and sends a response			0
to give these complex commands , viewers must press a button on the remote control as they speak , and during that time , anything within ‘ earshot ’ will be collected			2
the data is encrypted , but can be listened to by authorised @entity93 staff			0
last year , it consultant @entity109 realised his @entity110 was tracking his family ’s viewing habits and even knew his children ’s names because he had watched a family video on his set			1
an @entity110 set is pictured @entity119 tvs are television sets that link to the internet , allowing viewers to browse the web or watch programmes on demand , for example on @entity127 most are voice activated , so users can change channels without the remote control the @entity59 do this by constantly listening to the discussions around them , ‘ filtering ’ for simple key words , such as ‘ turn on ’ when they hear these predefined commands , they carry out the instructions to give a more complex command – such as a request to recommend a good programme – users must hold down a button as they speak most smart @entity59 then record the user ’s speech , and send it via the internet to a powerful computer , which processes it and sends a response back to the tv set this has to be done remotely because it takes far more computing power than there is in an affordable home tv 141 million smart @entity59 will be sold worldwide this year , and more than half of tvs sold are now ‘ smart ’ models the technology giant remained tight - lipped about whether it then keeps users ’ data , only saying that it does not sell information on , and that it operates within privacy laws , which vary by country			1
professor @entity166 , a digital forensics expert who has lectured at the @entity169 , said there was ‘ no reason ’ @entity3 would not be storing up data			2
‘ the fear is they could be building up a pattern of your preferences , or learning your voice , ’ he said			0
users can stop @entity3 from recording their conversations by turning voice recognition off			1
however , even then , the firm collects certain information			0
its privacy policy says that , if the feature is turned off : ‘ while @entity3 will not collect your spoken word , @entity3 may still collect associated texts and other usage data so that we can evaluate the performance of the feature and improve it			1
’ @entity66 slammed @entity3 for forcing people to ‘ opt out ’ of recordings , rather than giving them the option to opt in			2
‘ it is the wrong way to go about it , and even if you do opt out , you ca n’t guarantee [ your privacy ] , ’ she said .			0

@entity3 's privacy policy warns users about having private conversations
it said : ' if your words include sensitive information , that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party '
@entity3 smart tvs have voice recognition to capture spoken commands
it uses these commands to carry out tasks and improve the voice features
last year , which ? experts *monitored* of data from a range of smart tvs
they discovered all *brands* track people ’s viewing habits to some extent
and users give *permission* to do this in the tv 's terms and conditions
if viewers *reject* conditions they ca **n't** access some features on their tv sets - and @entity3 and @entity246 owners ca **n't** use them at all
