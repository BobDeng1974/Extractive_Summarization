by @entity1 reporter published : 20:39 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 20:40 est , 30 march 2013 pope @entity2 made his first comments on the @entity4 in a video message , suggesting that ' the man of the @entity4 invites us to contemplate @entity8 ' pope @entity2 explicitly linked the @entity4 to @entity8 in the same week forensic tests proved the cloth could have been produced during @entity8 's lifetime			1
in a special video message , the newly elected pontiff suggested that the ' @entity6 invites us to contemplate @entity8 '			1
he was speaking as the mysterious imprinted cloth was displayed on television for only the second time			2
earlier this week , researchers dated a sample of the 14ft linen sheet to anything between @entity21 to 400ad			1
the @entity22 has long avoided a definite approach regarding the cloth 's authenticity , but @entity2 's language was provocative			1
he said : ' this disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity , by war and violence which afflict the weakest			2
' and yet , at the same time , the face in the @entity4 conveys a great peace ; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty			2
' speaking on @entity39 , a day before his first @entity41 address in front of thousands of @entity22 in @entity43 , @entity2 said the cloth ' has the face of one who is dead '			1
he added : ' and yet mysteriously he is watching us , and in silence he speaks to us			2
' some commentators drew upon his use of the word ' icon ' , rather than ' relic ' , perhaps suggesting it plays a more symbolic role			0
this was backed up by the pontiff 's evocative language			2
he said the cloth , which is housed in a bulletproof , climate - controlled case within @entity61 , ' expresses a sovereign majesty '			0
the 90 - minute broadcast on state television network @entity64 was introduced by @entity2			1
he said : ' this image , impressed upon the cloth , speaks to our heart and moves us to climb the hill of @entity70 , to look upon the wood of the @entity72 , and to immerse ourselves in the eloquent silence of love			0
' the shroud , which is one of @entity78 ’s most controversial relics , was once described by @entity79 as ‘ an icon of suffering in every age ’			2
the recent scientific findings are in a new book called @entity84 ( @entity85 ) which is published on @entity86			0
hope for the faithful : the latest scientific results date the fibres from the cloth of the @entity4 to a period between 300bc to 400ad , which covers the years of @entity8 's life many experts stand by carbon - dating of scraps of the cloth that date it to the 13th or 14th century			1
however , some have suggested the dating results might have been skewed by contamination and have called for a larger sample to be analyzed			0
the @entity102 has tiptoed around just what the cloth is , calling it a powerful symbol of @entity8 's suffering while making no claim to its authenticity			1
the cloth is only rarely open to the public			0
the last time was in 2010 when more than two million people lined up to pray before it and pope @entity115 visited			1
describing the cloth , the @entity115 emeritus said : ' this is a burial cloth that wrapped the remains of a crucified man in full correspondence with what the @entity122 tell us of @entity8			1
' the latest display coincided with holy saturday , when @entity22 mark the period between @entity8 's crucifixion on @entity86 and his resurrection on @entity130			1
a few hundred people , many in wheelchairs , were invited inside the cathedral for the service , which was presided over by @entity61 's archbishop			2
it was only the second time the shroud has gone on display specifically for a tv audience ; the first was in 1973 at the request of pope @entity142 , the @entity102 said			1
@entity143 , i join all of you gathered before the @entity4 , and i thank the lord who , through modern technology , offers us this possibility			0
even if it takes place in this way , we do not merely “ look ” , but rather we venerate by a prayerful gaze			0
i would go further : we are in fact looked upon upon ourselves			0
this face has eyes that are closed , it is the face of one who is dead , and yet mysteriously he is watching us , and in silence he speaks to us			0
how is this possible ? how is it that the faithful , like you , pause before this icon of a man scourged and crucified ? it is because the @entity6 invites us to contemplate @entity8			1
this image , impressed upon the cloth , speaks to our heart and moves us to climb the hill of @entity70 , to look upon the wood of the @entity72 , and to immerse ourselves in the eloquent silence of love			0
let us therefore allow ourselves to be reached by this look , which is directed not to our eyes but to our heart			0
in silence , let us listen to what he has to say to us from beyond death @entity178 means of the @entity4 , the unique and supreme @entity181 comes to us : @entity182 made man , incarnate in our history ; the merciful love of @entity186 who has taken upon himself all the evil of the world to free us from its power			0
this disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity , by war and violence which afflict the weakest … and yet , at the same time , the face in the @entity4 conveys a great peace ; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty			1
it is as if it let a restrained but powerful energy within it shine through , as if to say : have faith , do not lose hope ; the power of the love of @entity186 , the power of the @entity210 overcomes all things			0
so , looking upon the @entity6 , i make my own the prayer which @entity216 prayed before the @entity217 : @entity218 , glorious @entity186 , enlighten the shadows of my heart , and grant me a right faith , a certain hope and perfect charity , sense and understanding , @entity146 , so that i may accomplish your holy and true command			0
