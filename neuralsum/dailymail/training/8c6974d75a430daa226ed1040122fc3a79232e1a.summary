by @entity0 playing video games really may have helped prince @entity3 spot the enemy faster , research suggests			1
researchers say that video game consoles help the brain to make better and faster use of visual input , distinguishing between one object and another - such as a ‘ good guy ’ and a ‘ bad guy ’ - more quickly			1
prince @entity3 famously said that he trained for flying @entity13 by playing on the computer , and a study by @entity16 in @entity17 suggests there was some truth in his comment			2

he famously said that he trained for flying @entity13 by playing on the computer professor @entity26 said : ' gamers see the world differently			0
they are able to extract more information from a visual scene			1
' researchers found 125 participants who were either non-gamers or very intensive gamers then ran them through a visual sensory memory task that flashed a circular arrangement of eight letters for just one - tenth of a second			1
after a delay ranging from 13 milliseconds to 2.5 seconds , an arrow appeared , pointing to one spot on the circle where a letter had been			0
participants were asked to identify which letter had been in that spot			0
at every time interval , intensive players of action video games outperformed non-gamers in recalling the letter			1
earlier research has found that gamers are quicker at responding to visual stimuli and can track more items than non-gamers			1
researchers say that video games help the brain to make better and faster use of visual input , distinguishing between one object and another - such as a ‘ good guy ’ and a ‘ bad guy ’ - more quickly prof @entity26 said that when playing a game , especially one of the ' first - person shooters , ' a gamer makes ' probabilistic inferences ' about what he ’s seeing - good guy or bad guy , moving left or moving right - as rapidly as he can			1
with time and experience , the gamer apparently gets better at doing this			0
he said , ' they need less information to arrive at a probabilistic conclusion , and they do it faster			2

@entity94 : @entity95 both groups experienced a rapid decay in memory of what the letters had been , but the gamers outperformed the non-gamers at every time interval			2
dr @entity26 said that the visual system sifts information out from what the eyes are seeing , and data that is n’t used decays quite rapidly			2
gamers discard the unused stuff just about as fast as everyone else , but they appear to be starting with more information to begin with			2
the researchers examined three possible reasons for the gamers ’ apparently superior ability to make probabilistic inferences			1
either they see better , they retain visual memory longer or they ’ve improved their decision - making			1
looking at these results , @entity121 said , it appears that prolonged memory retention is n’t the reason			0
but he said that the other two factors might both be in play , suggesting that it is possible that the gamers see more immediately , and they are more able to make better and accurate decisions from the information they have available .			1

gamers ' extract more information from visual scenes than non-gamers '
video games improve ability to make good decisions at a faster rate
intensive game - players have improved memory recall , say @entity17 researchers
