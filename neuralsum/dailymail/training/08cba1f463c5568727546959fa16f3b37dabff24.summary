the world 's urban areas have experienced significant increases in heat waves over the past 40 years , according to new research			1
scientists found that prolonged periods of extremely hot days have significantly increased in over 200 urban areas across the globe between 1973 and 2012			1
and they say that heat waves have been most prominent in the most recent years on record			2
researchers from the @entity11 and @entity12 studied 200 urban areas across the globe from 1973 to 2012			1
they found that extremely hot days ( stock image of a heat wave in @entity17 in 2008 shown ) have increased across the globe			1
and 2009 to 2012 were the top four years containing heat waves the research was published today in the @entity22 's journal @entity23 it was undertaken by researchers at the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and the @entity31			1
the study is one of the first to focus solely on the extent of extreme weather on a global scale , as well as examining disparities between urban and non-urban areas			2
the latest @entity39 ( @entity39 ) report was published in november			0
it said continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes			0
this will increase the likelihood of ' severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems			0
' such impacts include extreme weather and rising sea levels , heat waves , flooding and droughts			2
@entity57 , which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans , will harm marine life			0
without changes in emissions , ' climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century			2
' at the current rate , by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2 째 @entity67 ) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005			0
by the end of the century , that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 째 c ( 6.7 째 f ) warmer			0
the impact on the @entity73 could already be considered dangerous , the report claimed			0
the researchers obtained daily observations for rain , air temperature and wind speed from data produced by the @entity80 ( @entity80 )			0
heat waves were defined as periods where the daily maximum temperature was hotter than 99 per cent of days for the period 1973 to 2012 , for a consecutive period of six or more days			1
the results showed that there were statistically significant increases in the number of heat waves per urban areas during the last four decades			1
of the five years with the largest number of heat waves , four were the most recent years on record ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011 and 2012 )			1
results also showed a general decline in cold waves , and around 60 per cent of urban areas experienced a significant decline in extreme windy days			1
around 17 per cent of urban areas experienced a significant increase in daily precipitation extremes , and around 10 per cent experienced a significant increase in annual maximum precipitation			2
lead author of the research professor @entity105 from @entity26 said : ' our results show significant increases in heat waves and the number of hot days and warm nights , and at the same time declines in cold waves and extreme windy days in many urban areas over the last 40 years			1
' according to the @entity39 report in november , global warming is impacting ' all continents and across the oceans '			0
this map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents this map from the latest study shows the changes in the number of extreme hot days per year , and gives an idea of where the heatwaves have been occurring			1
hollow red dots show increases , solid red dots show significant increases			0
hollow blue dots show decreases , solid blue dots show significant decreases he continued : ' over half of the world 's population now live in urban areas ; hence , it is particularly important to understand how the climate and climate extremes , in particular , are changing in these areas			1
' urban areas make up a relatively small part of the global land area ; however , they are the centre of wealth , so damage to urban infrastructure could result in potentially large economic losses			2
' surprisingly , there have been few studies that have focused on changes in climatic extremes in these areas			0
' the team are now examining the impacts of climate and weather extremes in urban regions on critical lifeline infrastructures , as well as on urban and coastal ecosystems and marine life .			0

researchers from the @entity11 and @entity12 studied 200 urban areas across the globe from 1973 to 2012
they found that extremely hot days have increased across the globe
and 2009 to 2012 were the top four years containing heat waves
they also noticed a decline in ' cold waves ' and extremely windy days
the scientists say it is important to study these effects of climate change in urban areas as many people live in *cities*
