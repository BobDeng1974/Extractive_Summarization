' the fact that they are at home and that they play their best rugby at the @entity21 , they 're going to cause a massive threat for us			0

@entity0 knows he 's in for a tough afternoon when he comes up against the experienced @entity6 @entity5 centre @entity7 ( centre ) has formed an impressive partnership with @entity6 over the years ' it might be more open than the @entity14 game , but we want to stick to our game plan and follow through on what the coaches want from us			1

' i think the @entity124 centre partnership is up there with one of the best in the world			2
@entity128 ( left ) is @entity2 's danger man with some labeling him as the best fly half in the world ' they have a really physical threat and massive size in that 10 , 12 channel from @entity6 , and then a very good ball player and direct runner in @entity7			1
' they are going to test us big - time this week but we are fully prepared for what they are going to throw at us			2
' we 'll have to get off the line quickly in defence and shut down their space and options as early as we can			0
' we 'll look to get into them early , and we wo n't hold back			0
head coach @entity60 ( centre ) is closing in on winning the @entity54 with @entity2 once again ' i 'm constantly learning , growing into it more and more , getting a bit more confident with every game , especially with @entity16 outside and @entity151 ( @entity128 ) inside			0
