@entity114 , whose character was famed for his shabbiness and lack of hygiene , admitted he was ‘ a little gob - smacked ’ at being honoured and joked that he would now be rescuing damsels in distress and slaughtering dragons if the need arose			1
more seriously , he added : ‘ i ’ll use my new title to highlight the causes i believe in , particularly the importance of culture , the arts and heritage in our society , and the plight of the infirm elderly and their carers			1
’ with his catchphrase ‘ i have a cunning plan ’ , @entity114 became @entity22 ’s favourite dogsbody as the long - suffering @entity115			1
and as a history - mad presenter on @entity143 , he has dug up some of the country ’s most prestigious archaeological sites			1
but his knighthood reflects neither his popularity as a sitcom star nor as a history buff			2
instead , the 66 - year - old actor was recommended for his ‘ public and political service ’ as a @entity154 activist			2
his name was put forward by the @entity156 , set up last year by @entity157 to reward party workers			2
@entity114 was a member of @entity154 ’s @entity159 for four years during the @entity161 era , and spent four years as vice-president of the left - wing actors ’ union equity			2
his activism has never been low - key – wherever there ’s a high - profile @entity168 cause , he can often be found waving his red flag			2
when @entity171 and @entity172 were handing out @entity174 wristbands in the run - up to the @entity176 in 2005 , @entity114 was one of the most vociferous showbusiness supporters			2
his involvement with @entity179 has seen him make several documentaries in @entity181			2
recognition : the @entity117 star , left , was nominated for his ' public and political services ' in @entity22 , he rarely seems to miss a demo			2

@entity114 was a little - known actor before @entity117			0
but his career had begun with a @entity196 success – he was spotted in an amateur show and offered a part as one of @entity201 ’s boys in the original 1960 production of @entity204 ’s musical , @entity205 ! one night , as understudy , he stood in at short notice for the @entity208			0
the experience left him with a love of comedy acting			0
success : @entity114 was a little - known actor before @entity117 he spent years in repertory , then set up a community theatre group			0
by the time he was cast as @entity115 in 1983 , he was in his late 30s with two children			0
he felt distanced from the rest of the cast : @entity118 , @entity218 and @entity219 , and writers @entity220 and @entity222 , were all young graduates			0
the son of a council worker , @entity114 had left school after gaining four o - levels			0
‘ the impression you got was that they slid off the silver spoon straight into the rehearsal room at @entity233 , ’ he said			0
four series of @entity117 made him a household name , but it was a chance encounter with archaeology professor @entity236 during a holiday in the @entity239 islands that led to @entity114 ’s most long - lived tv role – as the eager amateur on @entity143 , leaping into @entity243 excavations or medieval ruins to uncover fragments of history			0
his enthusiasm was contagious , and the country fell in love with archaeology			0
even the @entity251 were swept along			0
when @entity114 was invited to a garden party at @entity253 , the @entity254 , the @entity255 and prince @entity256 became engrossed in conversation about what a @entity143 dig could discover at the royal sites			0
@entity114 ’s private life has been colourful			0
he had a short - lived first marriage , when he was 21 , and since @entity143 launched in 1994 , he has had long - term relationships with his admin assistant @entity264 , and with singer - songwriter @entity265			0
two years ago , he married his statuesque partner @entity266 , who is 34 years his junior and , at 5ft 9in , five inches taller than him			0
she is also younger than both his children from his 20 - year relationship with @entity271 solicitor @entity270			0
the knighthood will further increase his profile			0
he once said : ‘ @entity117 fans call out , “ i have a cunning plan ”			0
@entity143 lovers want me to dig up their garden … while the @entity277 shout : “ you labour idiot ! ” ’ from now on , perhaps that should be ‘ sir @entity154 idiot ’ .			0
