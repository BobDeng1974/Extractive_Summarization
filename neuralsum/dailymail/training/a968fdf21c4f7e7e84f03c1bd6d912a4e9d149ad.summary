satellites and cameras suggest low - level emissions of gas , steam and ash , scientists said , and satellites detected highly elevated surface temperatures at the summit			1

rumbling : @entity3 's @entity5 , pictured , is undergoing a continuous low - level eruption following an explosion early saturday morning according to scientists plume : a previous steam emission is seen from the summit in august of 2008 but with this weekend 's plume seen extending eastward just below 15,000 feet ' sudden explosions of blocks and ash are possible with little or no warning , ' scientists said			2
' @entity36 clouds , if produced , could exceed 20,000 feet above sea level			2
' the aviation alert level was raised from ' yellow ' to ' orange			0
' a major ash emission could threaten international flights			0
the activity began with an explosion at 5 a.m. saturday , followed by two others at 9:17 and 11:44 a.m. a nearby seismic network detected long - duration airwave signals that indicate a sustained eruption			0
past eruptions : seen in may of 2006 , ash plume rose from @entity5 but with the most recent having been in november of 2012 @entity51 is a 5,675 - foot peak on a remote , uninhabited island 940 miles southwest of @entity54			1
its most recent significant eruption began in february 2001 and featured three explosive events that sent ash clouds as high 39,000 feet above sea level			0
it also produced a rubbly lava flow and hot avalanche that reached the sea			0
the most recent minor ash emissions were observed in november 2012 .			1

@entity65 about 940 miles southwest of @entity54 last saw emissions in november of 2012
