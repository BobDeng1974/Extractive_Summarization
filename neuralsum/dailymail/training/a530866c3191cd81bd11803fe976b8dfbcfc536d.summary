by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 11:13 est , 29 august 2012 culprit : @entity2 , 38 , from @entity3 , who has been jailed for 26 weeks at @entity4 after conning a 75 - year - old dementia sufferer an elderly dementia sufferer was fleeced by two conmen who charged her £ 2,400 just to prune one tree			1
the 75 - year - old woman fell prey to fraudsters who told her it was a fair sum to have a lilac tree cut , a hedge trimmed and some rubbish removed			1
@entity4 @entity4 heard , despite considering the charge to be ' excessive ' , the vulnerable pensioner agreed for the work to be done at her home in @entity21 , @entity22			2
but after she handed over a cheque for the full amount the conmen gardeners fled , having cut just one tree			1
her carer then got involved and the conmen were tracked down by police			1
@entity2 , 38 , of @entity3 , and @entity30 , 20 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , have both admitted fraud			1
recorder @entity34 jailed @entity2 for 26 weeks , but he will not go to prison due to the time he has already spent on remand			1
@entity30 , who the judge said was the ' junior partner ' in the scam , was sentenced to a community order for 12 months with 180 hours unpaid work			2
he had denied being involved in the negotiations where a fee was agreed with the pensioner and claimed he had been paid £ 100 for the work he did			2
recorder @entity34 told them : ' it was clear to you she was an old lady and this was a despicable confidence trick			0
' the pair of you decided to trick a 75 - year - old lady out of £ 2,400 by pretending you were going to do some tree surgery work in her garden			2
' you did something , very little in my judgement , it would probably have had a value of no more than a couple of hundred pounds at most			0
' trick : the pensioner agreed to pay the huge sum for three jobs to be done , including trimming her hedge ( posed by model ) prosecutor @entity70 told the court the pensioner was targeted in september 2010 when two men came to her door and asked if she wanted work done in her front garden then given the £ 2,400 quote			0
miss @entity70 said : ' she thought it was excessive but agreed for the work to be carried out			0
' they said they would prefer cash as a payment and she explained she was unable to do that and would pay by cheque			0
' the following morning two men attended and cut her lilac tree			1
' she went outside and passed one of them the cheque			0
' that is the extent of the work carried out because they then left immediately			0
' it was after one of the woman ’s helpers questioned why she had spent such a large amount of money out of her bank account that the police became involved			1
the court heard by the time the case got to court the victim ’s health had deteriorated to such an extent she would have been unable to come to court or assist with any questions that may have been put to her .			0

the pensioner handed over a cheque and the pair ran off having only cut back a lilac tree
her carer saw the amount showing on a bank *statement* and *contacted* police
@entity2 , 38 , and @entity30 , 20 , both admitted fraud at @entity123
