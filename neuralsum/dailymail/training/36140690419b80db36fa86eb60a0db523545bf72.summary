the full extent of @entity2 ’s stealth tax raid on pensioners was laid bare yesterday			1
around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest – losing £ 323 annually with the end of age - related income allowances			1
in all , the ‘ granny tax ’ will take £ 3.5billion from the pockets of more than 4.4million pensioners			1
@entity10 have denounced it privately as the chancellor ’s biggest blunder			1
@entity14 : around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest - losing £ 323 annually with the end of age - related income allowances the new rules are so arbitrary that some @entity16 will lose far more than others born a day before them			1
@entity18 of @entity19 said : ‘ middle - class pensioners are outraged			2
my inbox is full of angry emails from those who did save for their future but are now hit			2
‘ the message of this budget is , do n’t bother to save for the future and if you ’re too old to work any more you do n’t count			0
’ the @entity29 said the chancellor should have given advance notice of his plan to freeze the £ 10,500 tax - free allowance for the over- 65s			1
@entity34 described it as an assault on pensioners who have put money aside			2
‘ the freezing and gradual abolition of the age - related tax allowance is an error , ’ said the @entity40 grandee			2
‘ it hurts those who have saved enough for modest pensions			0
it is unfair and lousy politics			0
’ part of the justification for the move was the promise of a more generous state pension of around £ 140 a week			1
but this is not expected to be introduced until 2016 – and even then only for those who hit pension age at the time			0
that means that those who retired between these dates would lose both a higher allowance and the better pension – a double attack on their incomes			0
this will affect around 2.8million pensioners – 700,000 a year for four years			1
existing pensioners are likely to be forced to see out their days living on the current state pension which , from april , will pay £ 107.45 a week			1
senior @entity10 have denounced the so - called @entity71 privately as the chancellor 's biggest blunder the @entity29 found that all pensioners with incomes of between £ 10,800 and £ 26,200 turning 65 next year would lose out on £ 323 as a result of the @entity26			1
they will be part of the 4.4million to be punished , with average losses of £ 83			1
shadow chancellor @entity79 said : ‘ the most unfair part of @entity2 ’s tax raid on pensioners is the effect on people turning 65 next year			1
‘ how can it be right that someone born a day too late loses over £ 300 with little advance warning ? just as on his botched changes to child benefit , the chancellor has simply not thought through the effect of his policies on ordinary people			1
' the poorest pensioners are not affected since they do not pay income tax and the richest pensioners do not get the allowance in any case			1
in wednesday ’s @entity26 statement , the chancellor said no one would be out of pocket as a result of his changes since the tax allowance for the over- 65s would be frozen rather than cut			1
he boasted that it was an attempt to simplify the tax system			0
but @entity109 of the @entity29 said mr @entity2 ‘ should have avoided dressing up what is clearly a tax increase as merely a simplification ’			0
he suggested that , for the change to be presented as a reform rather than a tax hike , it should have been delayed until personal allowances reach £ 10,000 – expected to happen in 2014 or 2015			1
but in a rare boost for the chancellor , the @entity29 said there was a justification for making cuts on pensioners because they had done better than younger people from the government ’s austerity measures			1
mr @entity109 said : ‘ our analysis shows that they have lost considerably less from recent tax and benefit changes than any other demographic group			0
and over the past decade and more pensioner incomes have risen faster than those of the working age population			0
‘ this looks like a relatively modest tax increase on a group hitherto well sheltered from tax and benefit changes			0
’ @entity140 dismissed claims that pensioners were going to be hit , calling it a ‘ fair budget for all our people ’			1
speaking to reporters in @entity148 , the prime minister pointed to the future increases in the state pension			0
‘ the first thing is that every granny around the country is going to be benefiting from the biggest ever increase in the pension that comes in in april – an extra £ 5.30 a week			2
‘ and at the same time , the @entity26 also delivered a tax cut for 24million people in our country , and also we ’ve now taken 2million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether			2
it ’s a good budget for our economy and it ’s a fair budget for all our people			0
’ a @entity164 spokesman said : ‘ this is an important simplification			0
it ’s sensible to have a single tax - free personal allowance for everyone			0
‘ the poorest half of pensioners will still pay no tax in 2013/14 and nobody will pay more tax in cash terms than they do today			2
‘ compared to the plans the government inherited , an existing pensioner with a full basic state pension will gain more from the triple lock in each of the next three years than they will lose from the age - related allowances freeze			0
’ mr @entity181 said the major feature of yesterday ’s budget was the large increase in the personal tax allowance to £ 9,205 from april 2013			2
he said : ‘ we are giving people the freedom to choose how to spend their own money , not taking it from them and then giving it back in a complex , means - tested system of tax credits			2
’ and defending the changes to pensioners ’ tax allowances , mr @entity181 said the @entity26 was transferring £ 1.7billion to pensioners – against £ 360million taken away by the allowances changes			1
he said pensioners on lower incomes would benefit from the growing personal tax allowances under the simplified system , while increases in the basic state pension would give cash in real terms			2
the business secretary said : ‘ there is a small group of people , frankly my contemporaries , who have high retirement income and considerable asset wealth and it is right in principle they should pay a bit more			0
there is a group of people who are not wealthy , on not particularly high income , and who could be affected to a limited extent as a result of inflation eroding the value of the allowances			0
those people will benefit enormously from the increase in the basic pension			0
’ mr @entity181 accused @entity229 of failing to fix the state pension system , ensuring the value of the pension fell back further and further from incomes			0
mr @entity2 stuck to a previous promise to increase the allowance to £ 10,500 for those aged 65 , and £ 10,660 for the oldest pensioners			1
this meant the over- 65s appeared to be gaining an extra tax break			0
but what he did n’t make clear was that by freezing allowances after this , any pensioner who already pays tax will get only 80p for every £ 1 increase in their pension			2
this is because the amount they can earn tax free will not change and , as a result , every extra pound in income above the allowance is taxed at the basic rate of 20 per cent .			0

around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest
the tax will take £ 3.5billion from more than 4.4million pensioners
