by @entity0 published : 03:47 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 12:51 est , 12 november 2012 failed @entity3 director general @entity2 may have been sacked had he not done the ' honourable ' thing and quit after just 54 days in the job , @entity1 has admitted			1
the @entity7 's chairman said he and other board members were poised to consider the ' option of termination ' but instead agreed to pay him his £ 450,000 salary for the next year if he left			1
@entity1 has been engulfed in a political row after signing off @entity14 's £ 1.32million severance package , which includes a £ 877,000 pension pot , as mps have called it ' unjustifiable and unacceptable ' and a ' reward for failure '			1
@entity2 quit on saturday when @entity19 apologised for smearing @entity20 after they accused a senior political figure of being a paedophile , which led to the @entity24 peer being wrongly named online as the man who abused children at a care home near @entity28 , north @entity29			1
hours before his resignation he had a series of disastrous interviews where he maintained he would not leave the @entity3 as he had ' a job to do ' , but then quit with a bumper pay deal			1
package : @entity2 quit the @entity3 on saturday and will get his annual salary of £ 450,000 plus a £ 877,000 pension pot under the terms of his contract , @entity2 was entitled to only six months ' pay , but the trust said that the additional payment had been agreed as a reflection of his continuing involvement with the various @entity3 inquiries now under way			1
justifying the deal in a letter the @entity49 , chair of the @entity51 ' media select committee , @entity1 claims it was for the good of the @entity3			1
pressure : @entity1 signed off @entity2 's generous deal that has put his job under threat and caused fury from mps ' the alternative was long drawn - out discussions and continuing uncertainty at a time when the @entity3 needs all of its focus to be on resolving fundamental issues of trust in @entity3 journalism , ' he added			1
' in the absence of @entity2 's honourable offer to resign , i would have had to speak to the trustees about the option of termination by us ( which , fortunately , was not necessary )			1
' in these circumstances , @entity2 would have been entitled to 12 months ' notice			2
in circumstances where we needed to conclude matters quickly and required @entity2 's ongoing co-operation in a number of very difficult and sensitive matters , including the inquiries into issues associated with ( @entity87 ) @entity86 , i concluded that a consensual resignation on these terms was clearly the better route			1
' in an urgent session in the @entity51 on the issues , asked for by @entity94 , media minister @entity93 said his payoff was ' hard to justify ' and suggested the public spending watchdog could probe the package			1
' the @entity99 is empowered to conduct a value for money review of any issue			2
if they decide to review this decision , i expect that the @entity3 would co-operate fully , ' she told the @entity51 , ' she said			0
' the circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the level of severance money that has been agreed			1
debate : media minister @entity93 said in the @entity51 that @entity14 's payoff could be probed by the @entity99 who would consider if it represented value for money ' contractual arrangements are a matter for the @entity7 , but the trust also has clear responsibilities to ensure value for money for the licence fee payer			1
' the @entity99 confirmed this afternoon it will talk to @entity7 over possible value for money review over @entity2 's @entity14 payoff			1
@entity24 mp @entity126 , a member of the @entity127 , said the @entity3 should be open to the same scrutiny as any other public institution			0
angry : @entity94 deputy leader @entity130 said @entity14 should hand half his package back in a question to the @entity135 , he said the @entity99 's boss , comptroller and auditor - general @entity138 , should have ' unfettered ' access to the @entity141 's accounts so he could investigate whether there were any irregularities in mr @entity2 's payout			1
@entity145 , @entity24 mp for @entity146 , said the chairman of the @entity7 had been ‘ asleep at the wheel ’ during the crisis at the @entity3			0
in a question to ms @entity93 , he said : ‘ @entity1 has wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds on the appointment process for @entity2			1
‘ he 's now wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds paying him off and saying that he was n't up to the job , he was overwhelmed by the job , and he was right to resign			0
‘ @entity1 has been asleep at the wheel			0
he has been off the pace right from the word go			0
he is part of the problem rather than the solution			0
’ senior tory @entity160 branded the pay - off ‘ outrageous ’ , while @entity94 's @entity163 of @entity164 - under - @entity165 said it was ‘ misjudged ’			1
conservative @entity166 of @entity167 said he was concerned such large golden goodbyes could be used by the @entity3 to ensure the silence of former employees who might otherwise cause embarrassment			2
@entity94 's deputy leader @entity130 called on mr @entity2 to return half the money , adding : ' the @entity7 can not justify a payoff of double the amount laid down in his contract			1
' @entity2 should reflect on this and only take that to which he is entitled			0
' she said it was ' disgraceful ' that @entity19 's report led to @entity20 being branded a child sex offender , ' a damning accusation which could only have caused him and his family untold distress '			2
mayor of london @entity187 has hit out at the ' shoddy ' and ' cretinous ' @entity3 journalists who smeared @entity20			1
in his @entity192 column he said that the corporation was in ' grief ' at its own failures but should be doing more to apologise to the @entity24 peer			0
' it ’s tragic for us ! say @entity3 journalists , who are all interviewing each other in a ludicrous orgy of self - pity			0
in all this nauseating navel - gazing and narcissism , there seems to be no one – from @entity1 downwards – who appears to be remotely interested in the person the @entity3 has injured			1
has anyone even begun to apologise , in a fitting manner , to @entity20 ? ' he wrote			0
@entity187 also added that @entity1 should say sorry to @entity20 personally			1
' the journalism was so shoddy , so cretinous , so ready to let the wish be father to the thought that the @entity3 really now has to show that @entity19 was not acting with malice , ' he said			2
' the @entity3 can not minimise what the programme has done			0
there will be people out there who will continue to believe that there is no smoke without fire , that @entity19 would never have broadcast such allegations unless there was something in it			0
' the @entity3 owes it to @entity20 to grovel and keep grovelling until the public gets the message			2
everyone associated with the “ paedophile ” segment on @entity19 should be sacked instantly			0
' then @entity234 should make a penitential pilgrimage to @entity20 ’s @entity237 b&b , on his knees and scourging himself with a copy of the @entity3 charter			2
this tragedy is not about the @entity3 ; it is about the smearing of an innocent man			2
the @entity3 needs to grasp that first			0
' but ms @entity130 , seen as a cheerleader for reform of how the press is regulated in the run - up to @entity251 's report into standards and practices of the press , attacked the corporation 's media rivals for ' pouncing ' on its latest crisis			0
' the @entity3 is a loved and trusted institution but it has enemies waiting to pounce , ' said the deputy @entity259			0
she called on the government to ' stand up against the commercial competitors and political opponents who are lining up to attack and wound the @entity3 at this moment of crisis '			0
she added : ' the @entity3 has made grave mistakes and it must sort them out , but everyone , including us politicians , must keep cool heads and let that happen			0
' prime minister @entity272 's official spokesman also said today it was ' hard to justify ' the £ 450,000 payoff to mr @entity2			1
asked whether mr @entity272 backed the payout to mr @entity2 , the spokesman said : ' that is clearly a matter for the @entity7 and it is an issue where they will need to justify that payment to licence fee payers			2
' clearly it is hard to justify a sizeable payoff of that sort , but that is a matter for the @entity7 and it is for them to justify			0
' he said it was ' a matter for @entity2 ' whether he chose to accept the money			0
asked how the @entity272 felt recent events had impacted on the reputation of the @entity3 , the spokesman said : ' it is important that the @entity3 grip this and that credibility and public trust are restored			2
' the move was greeted with anger and disbelief by @entity302			0
the chairman of the @entity304 , @entity49 , said the trust had to explain how it could justify such a large pay - off			1
' a lot of people will be very surprised that somebody who was in the job for such a short period of time and then had to leave in these circumstances should be walking away with £ 450,000 of licence fee payers ' money , ' he said			0
' certainly i would want to know from the trust why they think that 's appropriate			0
i find it very difficult to see a justification for that amount of money to be paid to somebody who has had to resign in these circumstances			2
' i would n't have thought that just because you have to help an inquiry into the @entity86 allegations you necessarily need to be paid a such a large amount of money			2
' @entity130 mp , @entity94 's @entity330 , added : ' it is not justifiable for the @entity3 to pay double the contractually required sum to the director general on his resignation			1
it looks like a reward for failure			0
' @entity2 should decline to accept any more than is required under his contract			0
' this is not the way to restore public confidence in the @entity3			0
' @entity344 mp , another member of the culture , media and sport committee , said @entity2 's severance packagewas ' symptomatic of the problems around the @entity3 ' , adding : ' he has not had time to make an impact and to get that amount of money is ridiculous			1
' he also said that @entity14 should ' think twice ' before taking it			0
media minister @entity93 questioned the size of the severance payment			1
' this is a large amount of money , and tough to justify considering the circumstances of mr @entity2 's departure and his contractual arrangements , ' she said			1
video : @entity2 urged to consider giving up half of his £ 450,000 severance			2

' in the absence of @entity2 's honourable offer to resign , i would have had to speak to trustees about the option of termination by us , ' @entity1 said
the former director general , who quit on saturday , will also receive a £ 877,000 pension pot
his contract entitles him to 6 months salary but @entity3 doubled it when he resigned
@entity1 signed off the £ 1.32m severance package with mps from all parties saying he should go
@entity302 call @entity14 's pay - off unacceptable and urge him not to take it while @entity272 admits it is ' hard to justify '
' this is a large amount of money , and tough to justify considering the circumstances , ' media minister @entity93 says
@entity99 may look at whether @entity2 's pay deal represented value for money for the *taxpayer*
@entity187 calls @entity3 ' cretinous ' and ' shoddy ' for smearing innocent peer @entity20
