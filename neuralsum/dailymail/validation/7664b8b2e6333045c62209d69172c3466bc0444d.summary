they might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as ' @entity2 ' but ' @entity3 ' , as the local media has christened them , certainly know how to put on a show			2
so far , the star is proving to be @entity8 who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the @entity14 ambassador 's residence in @entity15 last night			0
resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by @entity18 and her trademark pearl choker , the @entity16 cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of prince @entity22			1
arriving to cries of ' welcome your highness ! ' , a clearly delighted @entity37 happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the @entity43			0
not everyone knew who they were however , with one little boy asking his mother : ' who is that man ? ' ' the future @entity51 of @entity52 , ' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her @entity54			0
@entity22 and @entity8 are now on the third day of a four - day state visit that has been described as ' your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local @entity59			1
new name : the royal couple have been re-christened ' @entity3 ' by the local media warm welcome : both @entity22 and @entity8 have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people in a piece headlined , ' @entity8 and @entity22 do n’t get the @entity2 [ @entity69 ] treatment , but it ’s still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ' high - volume excitement worthy of boy - band ' that greeted the @entity72 with the quieter one offered to his father			1
but while @entity22 and @entity8 are n't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation , the visit is seen as ' crucial ' - for @entity22 at least			0
that echoes comments made by @entity14 ambassador to the @entity27 sir @entity81 who described the tour as being a fillip for @entity85 relations			0
' i am so pleased to welcome the @entity37 and @entity8 back to the @entity27 , ten years after their first official visit together , ' he said ahead of the royal couple 's arrival on tuesday night			2
looking around : @entity22 and @entity8 spent their first full day touring @entity15 star of the show : @entity8 , who is clearly been enjoying the tour , has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome smile ! yesterday , the @entity16 obligingly posed for a selfie outside the @entity43 cheering for @entity22 : local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the @entity43 ' their trip to @entity15 and @entity101 will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values , combating climate change , preserving the natural environment , creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the @entity110 play in keeping that relationship special			1
' much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries , among them the 800th birthday of the @entity116 and the 150th anniversary of @entity119 's assassination			0
both were ticked off the list yesterday , with @entity22 and @entity8 starting the day at the @entity43 in @entity15 and , in @entity22 ' case , ending it at the @entity124 for a viewing of the 1297 @entity116			0
today 's schedule , which , if yesterday is any indication , will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press , will see ' @entity3 ' visit president @entity119 's cottage in @entity15 later , the royal couple will be whisked to the @entity132 where they will meet president @entity134 in the @entity135 for the second time since he took office			1
president @entity134 is the sixth @entity85 president to entertain @entity22 , who has visited the @entity27 on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last			1
tour : yesterday afternoon saw them visit @entity143 , the home of president @entity144 patriotic : @entity8 is introduced to a @entity14 @entity146 named @entity147 who was dressed in a @entity150 scarf cuddle : @entity147 was on the receiving end of a right royal pat courtesy of the @entity16 pleased to see you : @entity8 gets a warm welcome from performers at the @entity157 shake on it : @entity28 shakes hands with well - wishers as she leaves the @entity157			2
