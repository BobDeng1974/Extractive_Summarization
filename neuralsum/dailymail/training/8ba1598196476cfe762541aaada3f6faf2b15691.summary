crackdown : ' accidental landlords ' will no longer be able to take out buy - to - let mortgages to cover their costs under a new @entity4 tens of thousands of ‘ accidental landlords ’ could struggle to secure mortgages under new @entity4 rules designed to clamp down on buy - to - let investors			1
‘ accidental landlords ’ are home - owners who have not intentionally purchased a buy - to - let property			1
they may have been forced to take out a mortgage to buy a second home because they were not able to sell their house , or have inherited a property while wanting to buy another elsewhere			2
but under the new @entity19 , @entity17 who fall into this bracket could be denied loans or pay more for their mortgage			2
a document published by the @entity23 to interpret the new directive describes an accidental landlord as someone who has become one ‘ as a result of circumstance rather than through their own active business decision ’			2
this contrasts with deliberate buy - to - let investors , who will usually have set up a company into which their rental income is paid			1
they will not be affected by the changes , and will still be loaned money on the basis of the rents they are bringing in			0
but the new rules will create extra affordability tests for those who fall in the ‘ accidental ’ category - roughly one fifth of the 1.6 million existing buy - to - let mortgages			1
they will have to pass criteria in the same way as traditional house buyers			0
this would mean that , rather than looking at how much the buy - to - let owner would make in rental income , mortgage providers would also have to consider salary and spending habits			1
the rules could mean that older buy - to - let customers could be denied mortgages because they would not be able to re-pay the full amount before retirement			1
@entity61 , a partner in retail financial services at @entity63 , said the new rules will cause huge confusion about where to draw the line			0
she said : ‘ essentially it will be looking at buy - to - let that is n't done for business purposes - “ reluctant landlords ”			1
‘ that may be people who are unable to sell a property and rent it out , or who ca n't live in a property because they have moved away for work , or who have inherited property			0
the line that is drawn is n't that obvious			0
the @entity23 was unable to confirm how many people would be hit by the rule changes			0
experts in the mortgage industry voiced their concerns about the new rules coming into effect in such a short time frame			0
@entity99 , head of consumer finance at the @entity101 , said : ‘ firms will only have nine months to get to grips with it , and that ’s not really how mortgage lending works – there is a pipeline			0
’ @entity109 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity110 , warned of ‘ higher mortgage rates and heftier fees ’ when the new rules come into force .			2
