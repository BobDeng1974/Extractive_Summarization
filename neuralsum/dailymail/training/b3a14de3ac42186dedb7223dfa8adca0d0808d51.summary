scientists believe they have discovered why modern humans develop brain disorders like autism , schizophrenia and @entity5 's but our near - identical @entity7 cousins did not			1
they say that while present - day humans and our extinct @entity7 relatives are 99.84 per cent genetically identical , there are important differences			1
they discovered the cellular equivalent of ‘ on / off ’ switches that determine whether @entity16 is activated or not			0
scientists believe they have discovered why modern humans can develop autism while @entity7 did not hundreds of @entity7 ' genes were turned ‘ off ’ while the identical genes in today 's humans are turned ‘ on ’			1
the international team of researchers , who reported their findings in industry journal @entity27 , also discovered hundreds of other genes were turned ‘ on ’ in @entity7 , but are ‘ off ’ in people living today			2
among these genes are those that control the shape of limbs and the function of the brain - traits where modern humans and @entity7 differ most			1
and the genes related to autism , as well as to schizophrenia and alzheimer ’s disease , were more likely to be ‘ off ’ in @entity7 than in modern humans			1
the discovery also underlines the power of the ‘ on / off ’ patterns			0
together , they add up to what is called the human epigenome , to distinguish it from the human genome			0
the genome is the sequence of three billion molecules that constitute all of a person 's dna , while the epigenome is which parts of that dna are turned ‘ on ’ or ‘ off ’ - even as the molecular sequence remains unchanged			0
some dna that was switched ' off ' in @entity7 is switched ' on ' in modern humans and vice versa the epigenome exerts such powerful effects that it is often called the ‘ second genetic code ’			2
in an interview @entity67 , of the @entity68 , who led the study , speculated that any given gene might ‘ do many things in the brain ’			0
when dozens of brain - related genes became more active in today 's humans , that produced the harmful side effect of neurological illnesses			2
but the main effect might have been the astonishing leap in brain development that most distinguishes modern @entity82 from our extinct cousins			0
the ‘ on / off ’ switches could also explain the anatomical differences between archaic and present - day humans , including @entity7 ' shorter legs and arms , bow - leggedness , large hands and fingers , and curved arm bones			1
one caveat about the research is that one person 's epigenome can vary markedly from another 's due to diet , environment and other factors			0
it is therefore impossible to know whether the ‘ on / off ’ patterns found in @entity7 genes are typical of the species overall or peculiar to the individual studied .			2

modern humans and @entity7 are 99.84 *%* genetically identical
but there is an ' on / off ' switch that determines if particular dna is activated
many genes that were ' on ' in @entity7 are ' off ' in modern humans
others that were ' off ' in @entity7 and ' on ' in modern man
this explains why only modern humans get autism and @entity5 's
it could also explain anatomical differences
