@entity0 ran with both arms in the air and a broad smile on his face as he enjoyed the acclaim of the @entity7 crowd and his team - mates			2
for one surreal moment all was well with the troubled @entity12 captain ’s world			2
sadly , though , he had not just scored a long overdue century nor was he celebrating a much needed win			0
instead he had just got @entity14 out			0
the fact that @entity0 was bowling , and taking his first @entity18 wicket , the day after @entity15 had hit 81 in a world - record last wicket stand said everything about the conditions for this eagerly anticipated first @entity18			1
at least he could enjoy the moment when @entity14 somehow tickled his less than medium pace down the legside to @entity63 while the warm reaction of the @entity12 team emphasised that the skipper continues to have their full support			1
‘ i ’ve got the match ball now , ’ said @entity0 after claiming a souvenir of his unlikely bowling contribution			2
‘ that was my action in its full glory			0
i made a late decision to do a @entity40 impression			0
i ’ve never ever done it before but @entity76 was egging me on			0
i just tried to pitch my length up and keep the batsman guessing ! ’ these may be difficult times for the @entity12 captain but he is still smiling and still standing after eventually having the better of this draw and even glimpsing the possibility yesterday of what would have been a famous victory			2
for one glorious , cloudy hour on sunday morning @entity12 could afford to dream of that precious and highly improbable win but the dust quickly settled on a stalemate that sees @entity0 with a wicket but without a victory in nine long tests			1
only the pitch and the @entity94 coffers emerged victorious from a draw that did little , other than during @entity15 ’s wonderful stand with @entity97 on saturday , to enhance the appeal of the ultimate form of the game			0
when @entity15 and @entity48 , below their best this season , combined for their most productive joint spell of the summer at the start of the fifth day , three wickets fell for just 17 and @entity29 were suddenly under unexpected pressure			1
the ball was swinging , @entity48 was on one of those rolls that have won @entity91 and @entity29 were only 145 ahead at the fall of their captain @entity110 to @entity113 ’s first ball with just four wickets left			1
yet that was as good as it got			0
it was a @entity48 charge that led to the brilliant win at @entity119 last year and a 3 - 0 lead in the ashes which provided no hint of the extent of the misery that was just round the corner for an @entity12 side without a @entity18 victory since			1
video an extraordinary game - @entity0 on his knees : @entity0 looks forlorn as @entity29 's tail take the prospect of a win away from @entity12 hitting out : @entity133 wields the willow on his way to his maiden test half - century trying everything : @entity133 tries a reverse sweep as he shores up the @entity139 innings pulling it back : @entity141 helped steady the ship for @entity29 after a middle - order wobble this opening draw in one of the most congested five - @entity18 series in history leaves @entity12 one short of their longest winless run for 21 years but at least @entity0 will have some crumbs of comfort to cling to as he heads to @entity153 ’s			1
@entity0 and @entity12 were staring down the barrel when they collapsed to 202 for seven in reply to @entity29 ’s first innings 457 but they pulled this test round in conditions that apologetic groundsman @entity159 should be ashamed of			1
what was @entity15 saying about @entity12 being amazing hosts ? well , @entity161 and @entity29 have played on three pitches that could have been made for them while warm weather has done little to help @entity12 out of their trough			1
all eyes will now be on the famously independent lord ’s groundsman @entity167 to see whether he can provide the pace and bounce that would not only provide a home advantage but also better cricket for long - suffering spectators			0
how @entity15 and @entity48 , who are in danger of being bowled into the ground this year , would love to see some life in the @entity153 ’s pitch on thursday but at least they will be cheered by their performances with ball and bat here			2
getting a bit edgy : @entity29 could still conceivably have lost when @entity141 nicked off to @entity184 ( left ) castled : @entity110 is comprehensively bowled by @entity113 as @entity29 's middle order wobble pitch perfect : @entity113 drops to his knees and celebrates bowling @entity110 glimmer of hope : @entity48 celebrates after removing @entity191 to leave @entity29 173 for five early strike : @entity48 ( left ) celebrates trapping @entity192 lbw as the batsman ( right ) slinks off @entity12 squad for second @entity18 against @entity29 at @entity195 , starting on thursday @entity0 ( @entity196 , capt ) @entity198 ( @entity199 ) @entity15 ( @entity200 ) @entity201 ( @entity202 ) @entity203 ( @entity204 ) @entity48 ( @entity94 ) @entity205 ( @entity206 ) @entity207 ( @entity200 ) @entity113 ( @entity202 ) @entity63 ( @entity206 ) @entity208 ( @entity209 ) @entity97 ( @entity202 ) @entity210 ( @entity119 ) @entity211 ( @entity204 ) there was also perhaps the best of @entity97 ’s four test centuries , decent contributions from @entity201 and @entity208 and a fighting spirit that belies any suggestion of an unhappy dressing room to encourage @entity0			1
that is not to under - estimate the extent of @entity12 ’s plight and @entity0 will need a win soon , or at least some runs , if he is to remain in office beyond the next four tests which will come thick and fast			2
the odd wicket will not help his cause			0
that win would have come on sunday had @entity133 , justifying his existence in his first test with 78 , and @entity232 with his second half century of the match not come to @entity29 ’s rescue as @entity12 flagged			1
this was a much worse test for @entity110 than @entity0 , the @entity139 captain following his appalling leadership during @entity15 and @entity97 ’s stand on saturday by missing a trick yesterday in not having half an hour bowling at @entity0			0
if @entity110 had declared once the draw was secured and dismissed @entity0 again @entity29 would have piled the pressure on him but instead they let the beleaguered @entity12 captain have the final word , improbably , with the ball			1
@entity12 have added left - arm spinner @entity207 to their squad for @entity153 ’s but it is hard to see how they can find room for him just yet without dropping @entity198 and that is surely out of the question			0
@entity198 may have been expensive here on a pitch which refused to break up but he ended up with four wickets in the match and while he is a work in progress with the ball he is the most promising of all @entity12 ’s batsmen			2
@entity12 do not seem far away from getting it right against a team now without a win in 15 overseas tests			0
but @entity0 knows that win has to come .			0

@entity48 takes two early wickets to give @entity12 hope
@entity133 steadies ship for @entity29 with maiden @entity270
@entity0 takes his first @entity18 wicket , @entity14 caught by @entity63
match *peters* out and teams shake on the draw at *5.05pm*
@entity278 is at @entity195 , starting on thursday
