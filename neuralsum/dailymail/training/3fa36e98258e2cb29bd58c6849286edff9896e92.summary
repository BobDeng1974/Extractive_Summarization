@entity0 is to send its last ever telegram this weekend , bringing to an end a 162 - year - old service originally set up in the heyday of the @entity5			1
with one final stop at the end , the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , @entity0 â€™s state - run telegram service , will wire its final message to an as yet unknown location on sunday			1
the service , the last of its type in the world , still sends around 5,000 telegrams a day and employs 998 people in its 75 offices			2
all stop : a worker taps out a telegram at the @entity21 in @entity22			0
@entity0 disbanded the world 's last major telegram service on sunday final posts : an @entity0 telegram messenger holds up some of the last messages to go out at the @entity21 in @entity22 but that is a far cry from its peak in 1985 when it was relaying some 60 million messages every year and employing 12,000 people			1
today the remaining customers consist mainly of local government offices sending administrative messages to remote areas which are still not covered by the phone networks			0
back in the days of the @entity5 , the telegram service proved an absolutely vital means of control for a colonial power ruling over a vast expanse of land			1
the first 27 - mile stretch of line was laid by the @entity47 between @entity48 and @entity49 as early as 1851			2
to cope with @entity0 's stifling heat and humidity , the cables used were far thicker than those in @entity54 and @entity55 and were covered with a layer of cloth and pitch to keep out the dust and monsoon rains			1
origins : a team of workers lays the underwater cable that stretched from @entity0 to @entity65 in 1870 mechanics : a museum employee in @entity68 with an 1837 telegraphy machine of the type used in the early years the network grew exponentially			1
one of the most famous early messages was sent to @entity73 in @entity48 in april 1852 announcing the fall of @entity75 during the during the second @entity76			2
and when @entity0 troops rebelled in 1857 , sparking a widespread uprising against colonial rule , the telegram is credited with playing a crucial role in helping the @entity5 mobilise and regain control			1
after the uprising was quelled , lord @entity73 famously credited the telegram as having ' saved @entity0 for the @entity84 '			1
@entity85 , former managing director of @entity87 , which had a mandate to send telegrams overseas until 2002 , told the @entity90 : ' the telegraph allowed the @entity5 to relay information across large parts of @entity0 in almost real time			2
communication : @entity96 , who led the struggle for @entity0 independence , relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds ' this leap in communications proved decisive '			1
in 1870 , underwater cables were laid between @entity0 and @entity65 providing a vital link between @entity105 and @entity65 's largest and most valuable colony			1
but like many innovations introduced by the @entity65 , the telegram was quickly adopted by @entity0 for their own use			1
@entity96 , who led the struggle for @entity0 independence , relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds			2
and during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 , the telegram would prove a vital link between families and friends at opposite ends of the country			2
@entity119 , who sixty - six years ago left @entity121 for @entity22 , remembers how she then used telegrams to keep in touch with her loved ones			0
' crossing the border meant risking your own life , ' she told @entity128 , ' at that time the telegram was the only way to keep families informed , give speedy updates and reunite			0
' prime minister @entity130 also relied on the telegram famously sending @entity5 prime minister @entity131 a message to request help from @entity134 when @entity121 troops invaded @entity136			0
@entity137 , a retired telegraph operator in @entity22 , remembers the service in its pomp as hundreds of workers crashed out the dots and dashes of @entity144 used on telegraph machines			0
he told @entity128 : ' the whole office sounded like a factory , ' he remembers			0
' sometimes we felt we knew every significant detail of our customer 's lives			0
' the word privacy did not exist in anyone 's dictionary then			0
' the service continued to be invaluable up until the 1990s with the advent of mobile communications			0
today @entity159 's old office , a colonial style building in the centre of capital barely sends out 10 messages a day and will soon be closed			1
he added : ' the new technology is so fast it just surprises me			0
communication is a game of speed , the fastest will always win the game			0
' eventually the telegraph system had to face defeat			0

@entity0 's state - run @entity7 network is the world 's last major telegram service
it is *due* to send its final message this weekend
at its peak in 1985 the service was relaying some 60 million messages a year
the network was set up in the 1850s during the early years of the @entity159
it proved vital for the @entity65 to maintain control of their most prized colony
