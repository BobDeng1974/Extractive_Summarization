senior conservatives today sought to insist @entity2 's plan to claw powers back from @entity4 remain on course after @entity5 refused to ' tamper ' with freedom of movement laws			1
the prime minister has vowed to put immigration at the heart of his renegotiation with the @entity14 , reassuring voters he will act to control the @entity16 's borders			1
but @entity5 chancellor @entity17 has made clear she will not allow @entity16 's calls for reform to ' interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in @entity22 '			1
the prime minister has promised to renegotiate @entity16 's membership of the @entity14 , before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
some senior conservatives are considering a proposal to impose a quota on ' time - limited national insurance numbers ' to limit the numbers of people able to move to @entity16 for work			2
others want an ' emergency break ' to limit numbers coming from countries which suffer an economic collapse			0
mr @entity2 promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , but the figure has topped 200,000 after a surge in the numbers using freedom of movement laws to move from elsewhere in the @entity14			1
but ms @entity24 appears to have dismissed any hopes from @entity16 of radical change			1
she told @entity55 : ' @entity5 will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the @entity14			2
' there is agreement between @entity60 and @entity61 on the need to limit access to benefits across the @entity14 , but ms @entity24 is not open to negotiating the right of people to travel without restriction in member states			1
a @entity70 migrant took the @entity5 government to court to claim unemployment benefits despite not having had a job in the country			2
mrs @entity24 added : ' i spoke to @entity2 and we agreed to assess the verdict together			2
these are controversial issues that are debated also in our country			0
' i am of the opinion that they need to be resolved in a way that tackles abuse			0
' but she warned : ' on the other hand we must not interfere with the fundamental principles of free movement in @entity22			0
' @entity2 had indicated migration reforms as key to mooted renegotiation of the @entity16 's membership terms @entity94 insists that mr @entity2 wants to limit the number of people who can come to @entity16 from the @entity14 , not end freedom of movement altogether			1
defence secretary @entity99 denied that mr @entity2 's efforts to renegotiate the @entity16 's relationship with the @entity14 were already foundering			1
' the negotiation itself has n't started yet , ' he told the @entity106 's @entity105 show			0
' we 've set out the outlines , giving national parliaments more say over @entity22 legislation - who would disagree with that ? ' stopping people moving around @entity22 to claim benefits , that is extremely important			0
' having an open trading @entity22 that has less bureaucracy makes it easier to create jobs and wealth as we 've done in this country			0
' @entity123 , a former @entity124 immigration minister , insisted that negotiations with the @entity14 were at the very early stages			1
' i think what you get at this stage , the stage before the negotiations starts , are people setting out positions from which they will negotiate			0
' because we know that when we get to the details of the negotiations , there are always things that we want to do , actually that the @entity5 want to do , and other countries want to do			0
that seems to me to be the fruitful area where we can have a successful negotiation			0
' ms @entity24 's comments come after @entity4 chief @entity143 this week said freedom of movement in the @entity14 should be made easier			1
mr @entity143 , who became @entity146 president despite the fierce objections of mr @entity2 , told one of his new commissioners to ' promote freedom of movement ' within the @entity14			2
the revelation came as new polls suggests the public would vote to stay in the @entity14 – even if mr @entity2 manages to secure ' modest ' changes to @entity4 rules			1
if the pm could not secure any renegotiation at all , people say they will vote to leave the @entity14 by 42 per cent to 36 per cent			0
national insurance numbers ( @entity159 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity14 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed if mr @entity2 manages to secure ' substantial ' changes people say they would vote to stay in by 55 per cent to 23 per cent			2
but if he can only get ' modest renegotiation ' a majority of the public say they would still vote to remain in the @entity14 , by 44 per cent to 36 per cent			0
the polling gave mr @entity2 hope that even small reform to @entity22 immigration rules could be enough to win public backing to stay in the @entity14			1
mr @entity2 has pledged to hold an in / out referendum on @entity16 's @entity14 membership by 2017 if he wins the general election			1
he had set to outline plans to limit the number of @entity22 migrants joining the workforce within the next few weeks , according to @entity180 sources – and was considering an ' emergency brake ' that could be applied if numbers of incomers exceeded forecasts			0
@entity186 leader @entity185 this week congratulated mr @entity143 as his new team of 27 commissioners was approved - despite mr @entity185 and other eurosceptic @entity189 voting against him			0
further curbs on low - skilled @entity14 migrants ' rights to benefits , tax credits and national insurance numbers could also be introduced			2
outgoing @entity146 chief @entity196 insisted last week that an arbitrary cap on @entity14 immigration would be incompatible with @entity14 law			0
mr @entity143 's call for @entity14 migration to be made even easier was a further blow to the prime minister			1
in a letter sent last month , mr @entity143 told ms @entity205 , a @entity206 mep , that she should be ' improving the conditions for geographic and professional mobility across @entity22 '			0
he cited the @entity14 - wide job exchange website @entity210			2
wednesday 's row came after mr @entity2 was urged by veteran @entity213 @entity212 to ignore backbenchers using the public ' hysteria ' over immigration to drive @entity16 out of @entity22			2
the former chancellor suggested the prime minister should let right wing mps defect to @entity186 so the party could get back to ' common sense '			1
he said : ' we must n't compete with ignorance and bigotry			0

chancellor says she agrees on tackling issues such as migrant benefits
but @entity24 is opposed to any fundamental change on make - up of @entity14
her stance *scuppers* @entity2 's plans for shake - up on migration rules
prime minister hoped to claw back control over @entity16 's borders from @entity14
@entity124 leader had also pledged a quota on *unskilled* migrants into the @entity16
