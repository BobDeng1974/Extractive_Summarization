@entity37 , the @entity38 at @entity40 's auctioneers who are handling the sale , said : ' letters of @entity3 are highly sought after around the world but this is without question one of the most significant letters			2
' the letters that have appeared in recent years were saying things like ' thank you for my birthday present '			2

' it 's written in 1943 and it signifies the moment he was taking on the whole leadership of non-violent moment			1

' in the letter , which is addressed directly to the additional secretary of the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity3 brands his arrest a waste of energy and money and urges the authorities to lock him up in an ordinary jail			1
he writes : ' it is unthinkable that when @entity9 's millions are suffering from preventable starvation and thousands are dying of it , thousands of men and women should be kept in detention on mere suspicion when their energy and the expense incurred in keeping them under duress could at this critical time , be usefully employed in relieving distress ... distressed : in the letter he describes his detention as ' a waste of public funds ' while millions of @entity9 starved to death ' the huge place in which i am being detained with a large guard around me , i hold to be a waste of public funds			1

' key sale : @entity133 , historical documents expert at @entity135 , with the letter but crucially the letter also refers to the resolution of the @entity139 @entity73 held on august 8 , 1942 where @entity3 had himself given a strong call of ' do or die ' for @entity9 independence			0
in the letter , he adds : ' as the government are aware i offered to meet the member of the @entity147 in order to discuss the situation and to know their mind			0
but my offer was rejected			0
' i had thought and still think that my talk with them might have some value from the government stand - point			1
' hence i repeat my offer			0
but it may have not such value so long as the government doubt my bona fides. ' as a @entity163 however , in spite of the handicap , i must reiterate what i hold to be good and of immediate importance in terms of war effort			0
' but if my offer has no chance of being accepted so long as i retain my present views , and if the government think that it is only my evil influence that corrupts people , i submit that the members of the @entity147 and other detenus should be discharged			0
' mr @entity37 added : ' this is an incredibly important document in world history			0
' the huge place where he was being detained at this time is now a national shrine in @entity9 because of this association with @entity3			0
' but typically , we did n't listen to him or release him because of the letter			0
the only reason we release him was because his wife @entity184 died as did his right - hand man @entity185			1
' and then @entity3 developed a very bad bout of malaria			0
' the only reason we let him out in 1944 was because the @entity6 authorities did not want him to die in captivity and thus become a martyr to the cause of @entity9 independence			1
