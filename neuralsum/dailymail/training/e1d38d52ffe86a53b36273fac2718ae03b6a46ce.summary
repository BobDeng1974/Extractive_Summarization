the @entity2 government now patrols nearly half the @entity4 border with drones to control desolate stretches where there are no agents , camera towers , ground sensors or fences , and it plans to expand the strategy to the @entity15 border			1
it represents a significant departure from a decades - old approach that emphasizes boots on the ground and fences			2
since 2000 , the number of @entity24 agents on the 1,954 - mile border more than doubled to surpass 18,000 and fencing multiplied nine times to 700 miles			1
under the new approach , @entity28 sweep remote mountains , canyons and rivers with a high - resolution video camera and return within three days for another video in the same spot , according to two officials with direct knowledge of the effort on condition of anonymity because details have not been made public			1
the two videos are then overlaid for analysts who use sophisticated software to identify tiny changes - perhaps the tracks of a farmer or cows , perhaps those of immigrants who entered the country illegally or a drug - laden 4x4 , they said			1
about 92 per cent of drone missions have shown no change in terrain , but the others raised enough questions to dispatch agents to determine if someone got away , sometimes by helicopter because the area is so remote			1
the agents look for any sign of human activity - footprints , broken twigs , trash			2
about four per cent of missions have been false alarms , like tracks of livestock or farmers , and about two per cent are inconclusive			0
the @entity2 government plans to expand the strategy to the @entity15 border			1
it represents a significant departure from a decades - old approach that emphasizes boots on the ground and fences a @entity52 and @entity24 drone aircraft is prepped near a hangar prior to it 's flight the drones patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and between 25 and 60 miles of the border the remaining two per cent offer evidence of illegal crossings from @entity4 , which typically results in ground sensors being planted for closer monitoring			1
the government has operated about 10,000 drone flights under the strategy , known internally as ' change detection , ' since it began in march 2013			2
the flights currently cover about 900 miles , much of it in @entity126 , and are expected to expand to the @entity15 border by the end of 2015			1
the purpose is to assign agents where illegal activity is highest , said @entity133 , commissioner of @entity134 , the @entity24 's parent agency , which operates nine unmanned aircraft across the country			0
' you have finite resources , ' he said in an interview			0
' if you can look at some very rugged terrain ( and ) you can see there 's not traffic , whether it 's tire tracks or clothing being abandoned or anything else , you want to deploy your resources to where you have a greater risk , a greater threat			2
' if the video shows the terrain unchanged , @entity150 chief @entity150 calls it ' proving the negative ' - showing there is n't anything illegal happening there and therefore no need for agents and fences			2
a @entity52 and @entity24 drone flight trailer , where pilots operate drone aircraft the government has operated about 10,000 drone flights under the strategy , known internally as ' change detection , ' since it began in march 2013 the strategy was launched without fanfare and expanded at a time when president @entity169 prepares to issue an executive order by the end of this year to reduce deportations and enhance border security			1
rep. @entity174 , a @entity126 @entity175 who chairs the @entity176 , applauded the approach while saying that surveillance gaps still remain			2
' we can no longer focus only on static defenses such as fences and fixed ( camera ) towers , ' he said			0
sen. @entity184 , a @entity185 @entity175 who co-authored legislation last year to add 20,000 @entity24 agents and 350 miles of fencing to the southwest border , said , ' if there are better ways of ensuring the border is secure , i am certainly open to considering those options			2
' border missions fly out of @entity196 , home of the @entity197 at @entity198 , or @entity199 , @entity126			1
they patrol at altitudes between 19,000 at 28,000 feet and between 25 and 60 miles of the border			1
the first step is for @entity24 sector chiefs to identify areas that are least likely to attract smugglers , typically far from towns and roads			0
analysts scour the drone videos at operations centers in @entity212 , @entity213 ; @entity214 , @entity215 ; and @entity196			0
after an initial survey , the drones return within a week for another sweep			0
privacy advocates have raised concerns about drones since @entity134 introduced them in 2006 , saying there is potential to monitor innocent people under no suspicion			0
@entity224 , the agency 's executive director of national air security operations , said law - abiding people should n't worry and that cameras are unable to capture details like license plate numbers and faces on the ground			0
@entity224 looked on one september morning as a drone taxied down a runway in @entity196 , lifted off with a muffled buzz , and disappeared over a rocky mountain range into a blue @entity239 sky			0
about a dozen computer screens line the wall of their trailer , showing the weather , maps and real - time images of the ground below			0
@entity224 said there is ' no silver bullet ' to border security but that using drones in highly remote areas is part of the overall effort			1
if there 's nothing there , he said , ' let 's not waste the manpower here			0
let 's focus our efforts someplace else , where they 're needed			0

*predator* drones used to patrol remote stretches of 1,954 - mile border
they use sophisticated imaging and mapping tech to analyse terrain
the flights currently cover about 900 miles , much of it in @entity126
@entity275 expected to expand to the @entity15 border by the end of 2015
