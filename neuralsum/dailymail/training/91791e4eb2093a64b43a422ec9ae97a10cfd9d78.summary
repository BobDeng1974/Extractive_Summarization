@entity1 boss @entity0 is determined to give his star men the freedom to fashion another famous victory over @entity5 at @entity6 on saturday			1
@entity0 limps into the game on the back of a dismal goalless draw with @entity10 last week and an @entity12 defeat at @entity13 which raised some speculation over his future at the @entity17			0
but the @entity18 has been buoyed by the memory of @entity21 's winner in last season 's corresponding fixture as part of a four - game winning streak which sealed their unlikely survival bid			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 says he will unleash his attacking players at @entity5 on saturday @entity21 ( number seven ) is congratulated by team - mates after scoring against @entity5 last season @entity0 said : ' you can not make ( @entity35 ) @entity34 , ( @entity37 ) @entity36 or ( @entity39 ) @entity38 become robots and do what you want all the time			1
they have to have the freedom to go forward and express themselves			0
' i think the mix has to be right - it is not perfect at the moment but we are still working on it			0
' @entity1 's win at @entity6 last year was their first since 1968 and @entity0 believes that factor could work to the @entity1 ' advantage as they seek to find the momentum to escape their latest relegation battle			1
@entity0 added : ' it is true that there is something different when you do n't win for years and years in a place and you go there and it looks like it is going to be more difficult than ever , and we did change that			0
' i think that is going to bring something different to the players - at least those who have been here a while			0
' @entity21 fends off pressure from @entity10 captain @entity71 during the draw at the @entity17 @entity1 winger @entity38 takes on @entity10 midfielder @entity73 before drilling in a cross @entity34 skips out of the way of @entity77 's challenge during @entity1 's draw with @entity10 but @entity0 warned the extent of @entity5 's current travails have been greatly exaggerated and believes @entity82 's men are still on course for a top - four finish			1
@entity5 's surprise defeat at @entity86 last weekend heaped more pressure on the @entity88 in light of recent questions over his style of play since arriving to replace @entity93 last summer			2
@entity0 said : ' i think it is going to be a totally different game - nothing compared to last year when @entity97 was their caretaker and we were playing for our lives			2
' now they are in the process of changing their style of play - for a team that has been playing for 20 - plus years in the same way it is going to be a difficult process			0
' i think people are being a little bit harsh on @entity5 at the moment			2
they are not as bad as people think because they are in a good position , and if they get in the top four a few people are going to have to recognise they have done better than people expected			0
' @entity0 suffered a blow this week with the news that @entity116 striker @entity115 is almost certain to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing ankle surgery			1
but his squad is otherwise nearing full fitness with only @entity122 and @entity123 struggling for the @entity6 trip , and more likely to be rested with a view to returning for tuesday night 's crucial trip to @entity127			0
despite their shock 2 - 1 loss to @entity86 , @entity0 insists that @entity5 should not be underestimated @entity5 goalkeeper @entity131 makes a last ditch save against the oncoming @entity133 of @entity86 @entity1 midfielder @entity115 ( left ) is almost certain to miss the rest of the season with injury @entity0 watches over his @entity1 players in training ahead of the trip to @entity6 on saturday			1
