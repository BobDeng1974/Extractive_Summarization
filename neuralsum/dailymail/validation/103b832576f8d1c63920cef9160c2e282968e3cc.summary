@entity0 responded to @entity2 humiliation , shipping 10 goals in their final two games , to bringing back one of their grittiest former captains			1
@entity8 was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team from the ashes of a 7 - 1 semi-final defeat by @entity13 and 3 - 0 loss at the hands of @entity16			1
his appointment was a controversial one among @entity0 supporters , having guided his country in a lacklustre 2010 @entity2 before he was sacked the last time			1
@entity0 defender @entity20 looks devastated after the final whistle at the @entity22 in @entity23 where the @entity2 hosts had just been hammered 7 - 1 by eventual winners @entity13 the @entity26 huddle to celebrate their fifth goal as the shell - shocked @entity28 head back to the centre @entity8 ( right ) has stepped up to take the @entity0 job and has impressed with six wins from six matches but when a nation was so embarrassed in their own backyard , a strong head was needed to take control and the 1994 @entity2 winner was deemed the man for the job			1
‘ we want to build a modern , compact , aggressive team but without losing the essence of @entity28 football - the dribble and the creativity , ’ @entity8 said in @entity40 ahead of playing @entity41			1
six wins from six matches , clean sheets in the first five of those and only one goal conceded plus fourteen scored is the perfect response to former manager @entity54 ’s failings last summer			0
@entity8 has encouraged his full backs to sit deeper , opting for @entity57 ’s @entity56 and @entity59 ’s @entity58 on the flanks despite the more attack - minded @entity61 performing well for @entity62			2
@entity63 ’s right back @entity64 has also been a major casualty of the @entity2 and @entity8 has waved goodbye to @entity67 and @entity68 up front , who sound more like characters from a @entity72 episode and played like them , too			1
@entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity58 complete a drill during @entity0 training in @entity40 @entity79 takes a selfie in the gym with @entity76 ( left ) , @entity61 ( centre ) and @entity74 ( right ) the goalkeeper , @entity83 , had to go and @entity85 stopper @entity84 is performing strongly , but being challenged by @entity87 ’s @entity86 for the no 1 spot			1
@entity79 is struggling to get back into the side at centre - back alongside @entity91 team - mate @entity20 , even though his performances in the @entity2 were praised and he missed the mauling by @entity13 due to injury			1
in @entity79 ’s absence after he missed the first match , a 1 - 0 win against @entity100 , due to injury , @entity96 ’s @entity95 has forged a strong partnership with @entity20			0
the captaincy has also been taken off him and handed to @entity74 , who has responded with six goals in as many games			2
they have more exciting options up front ; @entity110 striker @entity109 is currently this season ’s @entity111 top - scorer and he is vying for a place as their no 9 with @entity116 , who netted a double in a 2 - 0 win against @entity119			2
@entity79 ( left ) is struggling to get back into the side ahead of @entity95 at centre back for @entity0 @entity74 has scored six goals in six games since the @entity2 and has been in fine form there are still two places available in @entity0 ’s attacking midfield three alongside @entity74 , and @entity59 ’s @entity128 and @entity76 are front - runners			1
their pressing attacking play , instilled by @entity132 , is a facet to forward players which particularly impresses @entity8			0
but another name emerging is 23 - year - old @entity138 forward @entity137 , who scored a 25 - yard bullet to win their last match against @entity142 after being included in the squad for the first time			0
he is expected to start against @entity41			0
@entity75 , brutally left out of the @entity2 squad by @entity54 , is another banging on the door , especially with his performances for @entity149			2
@entity75 has been a star performer for @entity149 in recent months and will hope to shine for @entity0 @entity137 ( centre ) is all smiles as he competes in a training drill at the @entity41 on wednesday maintaining a core from the @entity2 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , have all been given chances in the middle			1
@entity8 has also been experimenting with some nostalgic choices			0
he has just recalled 31 - year - old @entity160 to the squad , even though he has had a mediocre spell back in @entity0 with @entity163 on loan from @entity165			0
he is a favourite of @entity8 , but not of the fans			0
back in october , @entity168 , another surprise omission from the @entity2 , also got a late call - up as a replacement for the friendlies against @entity119 and @entity173			2
he came on for the last eight minutes against @entity119 and 14 against @entity173 ( a game they won 4 - 0 ) but has not made it into the latest squad			0
@entity74 poses for a picture with @entity160 - who is back in the squad - and @entity62 left back @entity61 ( top )			0

@entity0 were beaten 7 - 1 at home by @entity13 in the @entity2 semi-final
@entity8 was handed the responsibility of rebuilding a fallen team
@entity0 have won six out of six since the @entity2 and are in fine form
@entity191 side play @entity41 and @entity192 in *international* friendlies
@entity75 , @entity109 and @entity74 looking to impress
