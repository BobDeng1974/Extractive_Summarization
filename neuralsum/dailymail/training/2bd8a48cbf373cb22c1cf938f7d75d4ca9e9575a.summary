@entity6 , 16 , said that nobody dissuaded her from the idea , as she pulled up the heavy drain cover weighing 22 kg ( around 3 stone ) to retrieve her two - week - old @entity11 , which she was unaware was insured			1
miss @entity6 said : '' i could reach the floor of the drain , so when i got pulled out i went back in			1
nobody said do n't do it , they were just looking at me as though i was nuts			0
in an interview with @entity42 's @entity41 , miss @entity6 continued to explain how she came to get stuck in the drain , and how the original pictures , which went viral , were actually taken by her mother			1
she said : ' i dropped the @entity3 down the drain , and tried reaching for it , but could n't get it			1
' in the end , i could n't pull myself out			0
' miss @entity6 appeared on @entity42 's @entity41 with her friend @entity50 , 22 , who attempted to help her out of the drain , to defend her decision miss @entity6 made it clear in the interview that most of the people around her during the event saw the funny side , including her mother , who she said took the original picture her mother and her friend had been responsible for the original picture , which has become a sensation around the country , being posted on @entity64 , after her initial panic turned to amusement			1
miss @entity6 said : ' she rounded the corner as white as a sheet , and then started laughing and took a photo			1
' @entity50 , 22 , an eyewitness and friend who came to her rescue after seeing @entity72 in the drain on a drive with his mother , said how situation was unique			1
he said : ' she was in high spirits , with a smile on her face , which you certainly do n't expect to see on a girl stuck down a drain			1
her friend @entity50 ( right ) was driving past when he saw his friend trapped in the drain , before hopping out because he ' needed to take a picture ' ' when i saw her i said to my mum " stop the car			2
i need to take a picture of this			0
" ' we did try and pull her out , but after a while in there she had no upper body strength			0
' miss @entity6 also said how she was going to manage ' horribly ' without her @entity3 for the time being			2
and after the retrieval attempt garnered @entity72 much embarrasment , it has been revealed that it was all for nothing , as the @entity11 , which was on a contract , was broken completely			2
her mother , mrs @entity6 , has since joked that she will be bringing out the pictures of her daughter in the drain on her 18th birthday and wedding day			1
@entity6 - @entity109 , 16 , managed to squeeze down the small drain on her street in @entity37 , @entity38 taxi firm worker @entity112 , 36 , said : ' i think it 's the funniest thing			1
at first i panicked , thinking " @entity115 , she 's going to sink "			0
' but when i saw her it made me laugh			0
she is upset about her phone , but at the end of the day at least she 's alright			0
' while miss @entity6 has been able to see the funny side , some eyewitnesses were not so amused , with one calling the event ' pure stupidity ' eyewitnesses to the event had mixed opinions about the entire situation , with some seeing the funny side , and others branding miss @entity6 's dip into the drain deeply irresponsible			1
one eyewitness said : ' it was pure stupidity , seeing the size of the girl , she should n't have gone down the drain in the first place			2
it could have been a lot worse than it was			0
another said : ' i do n't think i 'm going to see something like that again in my entire life			0
' i hope i do , because it was amazing			0
' @entity144 and @entity145 issued a statement that said : ' we 're really happy that there was a good outcome and that @entity6 was able to laugh about it			2
' but obviously with the recent weather a number of things could have washed down drains - she did n't know what was underneath her , it could have been unstable			0
' we 'd urge people to think carefully before trying to retrieve their objects			0
' @entity159 said : ' this event does just go to show how clean our drains are , that she managed to open the drain without it getting stuck on muck and grime			2

@entity6 , 16 , says nobody dissuaded her from entering the drain
she dropped her @entity11 down the grate on @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38
after lifting up the 3 stone cover , she *lowered* herself inside
but she had to be hoisted out by firemen when she became stuck
her mother took the first photograph that eventually went viral
