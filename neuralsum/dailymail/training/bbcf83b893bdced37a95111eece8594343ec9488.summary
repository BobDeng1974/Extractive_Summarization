@entity0 , crowned @entity1 after finishing runner - up in the @entity3 , is under scrutiny in his role as coach at the @entity7			1
this follows the upset around @entity0 being assigned to look after @entity11 ’s highest - ranked teenager @entity10 last april — yet not being with him in the build - up to @entity14 , where his charge exited in straight sets in the first round			1
@entity0 was playing an exhibition tournament in @entity20 in the four days leading up to 19 - year - old @entity10 ’s big moment at the @entity22			1
keeping busy : @entity0 playing an exhibition match in @entity20 in the lead up to @entity14 and there is now concern whether busy @entity0 , who has media commitments and is a regular on the seniors circuit , has sufficient time to coach @entity10			1
@entity7 chief executive @entity29 said after @entity0 ’s appointment : ‘ it reflects very highly on @entity0 that he wanted to step up and take on this challenge			2
’ yet neither @entity35 nor @entity36 were too impressed with the choice of @entity0 to guide @entity10 , it is understood			1
gone : @entity10 suffered a straight sets first - round defeat by @entity41 's @entity40 an @entity7 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity0 agreed to take part in @entity20 well before he was appointed as @entity10 ’s coach			1
our performance team are working to achieve a level of continuity for @entity10 ’s coaching situation			2
@entity29 is believed to be paying @entity51 @entity50 around £ 250,000 a year — not far short of the ceo ’s own salary — to be director of player development when the @entity7 are involved in a nationwide cost - cutting process which has seen more than 30 jobs lost			2
however , @entity50 and @entity29 ’s combined wages are still less then the obscene £ 640,000 a year the @entity7 were paying former ceo @entity58			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. chairman @entity59 works only part - time for the @entity61 and was entitled to take up an invitation to @entity14 ’s @entity63 on monday			2
but somehow it seemed wrong for @entity59 to be enjoying lavish @entity66 hospitality quite so soon after @entity68 ’s footballers had let down the nation in @entity70 , with the @entity61 chief not prepared to discuss it			0
the @entity7 , who have a poor record with communications chief appointments , have once again , in their wisdom , given this crucial role to someone from outside tennis			0
there is a real need at the @entity7 for a top media operator to make the most of @entity35 ’s golden years			0
yet @entity85 , recruited from tourism agency @entity68 , is much more of a marketing specialist			0
@entity7 chief @entity29 believes marketing is key to revitalising his organisation ’s battered image			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity90 , whose average rating for women ’s tennis is just 3,000 viewers , have rushed out a somewhat premature advertising campaign with @entity97			1
it has the @entity100 star promoting @entity90 ’s @entity102 coverage for the 2015 - 16 campaign , despite all @entity97 ’s football for club and country being screened by arch - rivals @entity108 next season			1
focus : @entity97 films a @entity90 commercial advertising their @entity112 football portfolio @entity114 failure bookmakers @entity115 reached a new low with an alleged seven - figure offer to serial biter @entity117 to wear a branded gumshield in the @entity122 @entity121 match against @entity123			1
@entity115 claim they had agreed a deal with @entity117 ’s advisors before his @entity127 ban scuppered the project			2
the rabid publicists say their connection with @entity117 was made through an earlier proposed gumshield stunt on his return to football after biting @entity135 ’s @entity134 last year			2
joke : a @entity115 billboard aimed at @entity117 after his bite on @entity139 @entity140 , all - powerful chairman of the @entity66 , is the force behind the unnecessary policing to ensure all - white clothing regulations are enforced — even to the extent of 1987 singles champion @entity145 not being allowed to wear his signature check headband in the seniors event			1
there is also disquiet at the way @entity140 has turned the @entity63 into such a celebrity fest , particularly on the first saturday when random sporting guests receive invites despite doing nothing noteworthy of late			0
@entity140 enjoys having the stars around him , as shown by him sitting next to @entity156			0
watching on : @entity140 in the @entity63 with sir @entity157 and prince @entity158			0

@entity0 is @entity10 's coach , but was playing an exhibition in @entity20 in lead up to @entity14
@entity10 suffered straight - sets defeat by @entity40 in first round
@entity90 rush into premature advertising campaign with @entity97
@entity115 wanted @entity117 to wear a branded gum shield against @entity123 , but @entity122 *striker* was banned
