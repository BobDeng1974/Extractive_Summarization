an series of images by the @entity2 has revealed the movement of glaciers in southern @entity5			1
they reveal how the majority of glaciers have rapidly retreated since the late 19th century - although a small minority have advanced			1
the technique - known as repeat photography - helps scientists determine how much a region has changed over time			0
slide the images below to see the changing appearance of @entity5 's glaciers over time here the retreat of the @entity19 can be seen			1
on the left , a photograph taken on 13 august 1941 shows a glacier 0.43 miles ( 0.7km ) thick , with large seracs - house - sized chunks of ice - on its face			2
by 11 august 2005 , however , it has completely disappeared from view - seen on the right by analysing the various photographic pairs , scientists can document the evolution of the @entity5 landscape , and see how it is responding to retreating glacier ice - with an interactive map also showing their locations			1
the balance of glaciers and the surrounding environment can drastically affect ecosystems			1
when glaciers retreat , as many have done since 1850 , it can affect the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use			1
it can also affect animal and plans that depend on melt - water from glaciers , while in the longer term it can cause ocean levels to rise			2
the increasing rate at which glaciers are retreating is one indication of how global warming is already affecting the planet			1
one pair of images shows the west shoreline of @entity19 , @entity64 and @entity65 , in @entity5 - and the changes that have taken place since 1892			1
one photograph , taken on 13 august 1941 , shows a glacier 0.43 miles ( 0.7km ) thick , with large seracs - house - sized chunks of ice - on its face			2
by 11 august 2005 , however , the glacier has completely disappeared from , the same location , having retreated more than 31 miles ( 50km )			2
in its place , abundant vegetation is located on the slopes in the photograph			2
another pair of images show the retreat of the @entity84 between 10 june 1899 and 6 september 2003			0
the photograph from 1899 is taken towards the northwest and shows the 197 - foot ( 60 metres ) high terminus of the retreating glacier			0
by 104 years later , the glacier has retreated 1.9 miles ( 3km ) and is barely visible in the same field of view			1
again , vegetation becomes much more abundant as it retreats			0
the retreat of @entity84 between 10 june 1899 ( left ) and 6 september 2003 ( right ) is seen here			0
the glacier has retreated 1.9 miles ( 3km ) and is barely visible , while more vegetation has begun to grow on the side of the hills the images of the glaciers in southern @entity5 ( locations shown here ) were compiled by the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) this set of images shows the remarkable retreat of the @entity103 between 30 july 1909 ( left ) and 11 august 2004 ( right )			1
the retreat of the glacier here took place over a distance of about 9.8 miles ( 15km ) the first photograph on the left is of the @entity111 at some point between the mid- 1920s and 1940s			1
a second photograph on the right , taken on 12 august 2005 , shows how it has retreated more than 6.2 miles ( 10km ) out of view another set of images show the stunning retreat of @entity103 between 30 july 1909 and 11 august 2004			1
the retreat of the glacier here is about 9.8 miles ( 15km ) in a pair of north looking photographs , taken looking west of @entity122 , another dramatic retreat of ice can be seen			2
the first photograph is an undated winter to summer view from a postcard , likely from between the mid- 1920s and the 1940s			0
a second photograph , taken on 12 august 2005 , shows a startlingly different view of the same location			0
in the area , the @entity111 has retreated more than 6.2 miles ( 10km ) out of view			0
the aptly named @entity139 , meanwhile , with a gentle slope running down into water , is seen retreating during 103 years between 20 august 1905 and 22 august 2008			2
the aptly named @entity139 is seen on the left on 20 august 1905			0
103 years later on 22 august 2008 , right , it has almost completely disappeared one of the most dramatic pairs of images sees @entity144 , pictured right in the mid- 1920s to 1940s , replaced by vegetation including grasses and shrubs by 10 august 2005 , seen on the right not all the glaciers have been on the retreat			1
@entity151 is seen on the left on 1 july 1909 , but by 3 september 2000 - right - it had advanced 0.78 miles ( 1.25km ) one of the most dramatic pairs of images is the @entity154 , seen rapidly from the mid- 1920s and 1940s to 10 august 2005			0
in its place , most of the lake has filled with sediment , and now supports several varieties of grasses , shrubs and aquatic plants			0
but not all the glaciers have been on the retreat			0
one , @entity151 , has advanced 0.78 miles ( 1.25km ) between 1 july 1909 and 3 september 2000 , seen in a pair of images			0
overall , though , the images highlight how the changing climate is having a rapid effect on a variety of ecosystems â€“ and not necessarily for the better .			0

images have shown how many glaciers in southern @entity5 have retreated since the late 18th century
some are seen retreating by several miles in just over 100 years as global warming takes its toll
in some *instances* vegetation and new water *springs* up in the place of the old glacier
but glacial retreat can *negatively* affect the surrounding environment and ecosystems
