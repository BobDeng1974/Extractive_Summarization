@entity0 scored on his @entity2 home debut as @entity4 's side thrashed @entity5 4 - 0 at @entity6			1
first - half goals from @entity8 , as well as @entity9 and @entity10 put the hosts in the ascendancy before @entity13 added gloss to the scoreline in the second half			1
@entity17 also came off the bench to make his debut for the @entity20 as they romped to victory over @entity24 's side			2
here , @entity26 's @entity25 gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players			0
@entity0 's free - kick flies into the bottom right corner as @entity2 take the lead against @entity5 @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity34 – first - half mistake nearly proved costly but the @entity36 made amends with a couple of smart saves 6			1
@entity39 – the @entity40 looked fired up and determined to prove a point following speculation that he could be on his way 6.5			0
@entity45 – far more comfortable in a four - man defence and produced a fantastic block to deny @entity48 an open goal in the first half 6.5			2
@entity50 – amid the big - money arrivals at @entity2 , the homegrown youngster continues to blend in comfortably and capable 6.5			2
@entity53 – quieter debut at left back than @entity2 ’s other new boys but dealt with everything that came his way			2
there will be sterner tests than this 6			0
@entity53 takes control of the ball for @entity2 during their 4 - 0 win against @entity5 @entity65 – he prefers a midfield holding role to left back and showed why			1
looked comfortable from the start			0
no fuss , no problem for the @entity71 7			0
@entity65 looks to get @entity2 on the attack during their thrashing of @entity5 @entity9 – poor distribution early on but grew into the game and excelled after that , scoring the second and having a hand in the third			1
@entity9 's precise drive doubled @entity2 's lead against @entity5 @entity9 is understandably delighted after scoring his first @entity2 goal to put them 1 - 0 up @entity13 – some questioned whether he would have a place in the new order , but played well behind the two strikers and weighed in with a goal			1
@entity13 finishes brilliantly from close range to put @entity2 further ahead @entity13 turns away to celebrate after making it 4 - 0 to @entity2 @entity0 – has there been a better home debut at @entity6 than this since @entity10 ’s hat - trick against @entity92 in 2004 ? scored one , had a hand in three more			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring his first goal for @entity2 on his home debut against @entity5 @entity0 produced a classy performance on his @entity2 debut against @entity5 @entity10 – he ’s no longer the lone star at @entity2 but still showed his worth with a well - taken strike to make it 3 - 0 and put the game beyond @entity5 7			1
@entity10 fires home emphatically to put @entity2 3 - 0 up before half - time @entity10 celebrates scoring @entity2 's third goal of the game @entity106 – still not at the top of his game amid concerns that he might still be hampered by old knee problems			1
booked for a poor challenge 5.5 @entity114 : @entity115 , @entity17 ( for @entity116 , 5.5 ) , @entity117 ( for @entity8 82 ) , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 ( for @entity121 , 6 ) , @entity122			0

@entity123 : @entity124 24 , @entity9 36 , @entity10 44 , @entity13 58 @entity17 made his first appearance for @entity2 when coming off the bench in place of @entity13 @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity128 – could possibly have done better with the first goal but could n’t be faulted for the others and kept the score down 6.5 @entity132 – had the misfortune to come up against @entity8 on a day when the most expensive player in the history of @entity137 football was simply on fire 5 @entity138 – tried to stem the tide but was n’t nearly tight enough on @entity10 when he fired in the third goal from the edge of the box 5.5 @entity143 – probably cursing his luck that his return to @entity2 did n’t come a couple of weeks earlier			1
he ’s been on the other side of these results enough times at @entity6 5.5			0
@entity143 endured an unhappy return back at @entity6 as his @entity5 side were thrashed @entity151 – looked to be struggling in the first half in every sense , and was subbed at the interval 5			2
@entity155 – worked hard in a holding role in front of the back four , but there could have been four of him and they would still have struggled to contain @entity2 6			0
@entity161 had a frustrating debut for @entity5 as they were thrashed at @entity2 @entity161 's afternoon went from bad to worse as he went off injured on his @entity5 debut @entity164 – had the best chance to equalise after @entity167 ’s error in the first half but did n’t take it and there was only going to be one result after that 6			1
@entity171 – worked hard in the centre of midfield in very difficult circumstances			0
they wo n’t come any harder than this 5.5			0
@entity176 – had a chance to pull a goal back early in the second half but his effort was well saved by @entity167 6			0
@entity176 , seen holding off @entity9 , made his first appearance of the season for @entity5 @entity184 – starved of possession and had very little opportunity to make an impact on the game 5.5			1
@entity189 – thankless task ploughing that lone furrow up front and the former @entity194 man was finally given a breather 14 minutes after half - time 6			0
@entity189 struggled to make an impact for @entity5 in the lone role upfront video we were unlucky - @entity24 @entity114 : @entity199 , @entity200 ( for @entity201 , 6 ) , @entity202 , @entity203 ( for @entity161 , 6 ) , @entity204 ( for @entity205 59 , 5.5 ) , @entity206 , @entity207 subs not used : @entity199 , @entity202 , @entity206 , @entity207			2
