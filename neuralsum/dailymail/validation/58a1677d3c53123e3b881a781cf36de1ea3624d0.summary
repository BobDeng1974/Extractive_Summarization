@entity0 is sipping afternoon tea in the lounge of a hotel just off the @entity4 when the conversation turns to football ’s ‘ f - off mentality ’ , as he calls it			1
‘ a lot of young players have an “ f - off mentality ” these days , but i honestly did n’t mind it because i was the one picking the team , ’ he admitted			1
‘ the dressing room is a heated environment at half - time and full - time , and if a player said that to me and could justify their argument then no problem			2
if not , they were down the road			2
’ @entity0 has been out of work since leaving his role as director of football at @entity27 a year ago @entity0 played as a winger for @entity29 for eight years between 1975 and 1983 @entity0 leads his @entity31 side onto the @entity33 pitch in the first 1990 fa cup final against @entity29 @entity0 knows all about the sport ’s ‘ f - off mentality ’ , on the receiving end after leaving an unpaid role as director of football at @entity27 last march			1
it seems incredible that this man , with more than 1,000 games in the dug - out and who has twice been named @entity41 manager of the year ( 2006 and 2007 ) , is out of work			1
no - one really knows why			2
it just does n’t feel right to see @entity0 , a man of integrity and honour , on the fringes of football			1
something , somewhere , has gone wrong when @entity0 is working on his golf handicap every day			1
‘ i won the @entity41 award two years on the bounce with @entity55 and looking back , yes , massive , ’ he admitted			1
‘ they talk about comedians being on the road for 20 years and suddenly they become an overnight sensation — i had done that time			0
‘ all @entity60 ever asked of me was to come up to the boardroom after a game and have a pint with him — no interference , nothing			0
sometimes we would n’t even talk about the result			0
’ at 59 @entity0 is a statesman of the game , one of the shrewdest operators in the sport			1
after a playing career on the wing with @entity29 he spent nearly 30 years in the dug - out			2
@entity0 issues his side with instructions after drawing 3 - 3 with @entity29 in the final before extra-time @entity0 poses with his @entity76 in 2006 during his spell in charge of @entity55 ‘ i just wanted to be known as a good manager , i never wanted to be famous , ’ he admitted when he was reluctantly coaxed to the @entity80 - on - @entity79			1
it is clear , after a couple of hours in @entity0 ’s illuminating company , that he has the itch to work again , but it will only be on his terms			1
‘ there are 70 clubs you do n’t want to manage because you have no chance			0
‘ @entity93 always talks about @entity94 at @entity95 : create an environment for your players to win matches			2
that is the art of management			0
i can get you promotion within two years if you back me , the @entity92 is my division , i know what it ’s about			2
if you want a five - year plan , fannying around , building from the bottom up , i ’m not your man			1
’ he did it at @entity31 , taking over at the age of 28 and leading them into the top flight when he put together the team that included @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
‘ you could never do that now because the game would n’t give you five years to get promoted and because @entity119 changed everything in favour of the players , ’ he said			0
‘ pre-bosman @entity112 could have been on £ 100 a week , his contract could be coming to an end and we could offer him £ 101 and he would have no choice but to stay			0
‘ in modern terms , @entity112 would have disappeared from @entity31 after a year			2
’ @entity0 celebrates with then @entity31 chairman @entity129 after winning the 1997 play - off final @entity0 , pictured at the @entity133 1982 @entity132 finals , won 42 international caps for @entity135 to recap , @entity0 won two promotions with @entity31 , took them to their only @entity139 final , won promotion with @entity55 to the @entity141 and finished eighth in their first season in the top flight			1
there has been the occasional blip , such as the aborted spells at @entity148 and @entity149 , but after three decades in management , it is no more than a footnote to his career			0
‘ if i got really busy around football clubs then i could work again but i choose not to be , in the footballing sense , ’ he admitted			1
‘ i do n’t go looking for it			0
i have an agent but he does n’t go looking for it , either			0
‘ i still go to games and i enjoy the core things that football gives me , which is working out how people win matches and influence players			1
’ @entity0 is a student of the game , a manager who travelled all over the country to watch players at every level and build up an encyclopaedic knowledge of teams and tactics			1
he would rather sit in the stands than head for the directors ’ box , convinced that speaking to the supporters who watch the players week in , week out will give him a far better education			0
‘ it is a simple game and the fans are n’t fools , they know what they ’re watching			0
they will give you a far better idea of who is consistent and who is a fanny merchant than listening to anyone in the boardroom or allowing your mind to be affected by another scout or coach			0
’ palace players doused @entity0 with champagne after winning the @entity196 play - off final in 1989 @entity0 admits being a manager consumes every part of your life and he found it difficult to switch off @entity0 's last job in management was with @entity149 in 2010 @entity0 is a fascinating man to listen to as he talks through his management career			1
‘ managing clubs is unhealthy because you are time deprived			2
it is all - consuming , certainly the way i did it			2
you can be at the cinema and all you can think about is : how can we beat @entity211 on saturday ? it gets you like that			0
‘ the game has changed			0
the @entity141 is a handicap system , with the big clubs putting 25 or 30 players out on loan — football should be provocative and change it			1
have a squad of 25 by all means , chop and change them in january , but you do n’t need 70 players			0
‘ if you know someone at a big club it ’s all so sycophantic — “ we will guarantee him a game , he will play ”			0
we are prostituting ourselves to get a few scraps from the big boys			0
‘ @entity231 is trying to improve things but the @entity139 are a toothless tiger			0
the @entity141 are 100 per cent successful in what they set out to do , which is to make as much money as possible			1
when i was a player , if @entity29 played @entity238 in @entity196 they had to share the gate receipts			0
’ when you sit down with @entity0 , he is a million miles away from the monosyllabic character who would turn up at press conferences when he was in work			1
the 59 - year - old won consecutive @entity245 awards in 2006 and 2007 ‘ i look at @entity246 , the head coach of the @entity247 , and he ’s won four @entity248 in 11 years			1
one - word answers , but he delivers			2
’ so did @entity0 , a popular figure in dressing rooms at his clubs			1
he knows how to knit together a winning team			0
this is a man who consciously spent a year out of the game when he left @entity55 after they failed to beat @entity259 in the @entity92 play - off semi-final in 2009			1
‘ i used to go to @entity261 to watch @entity262			0
a lot of people do n’t share my opinion of @entity262 but to work across @entity266 consistently and mainly be successful — and to act with integrity — and do things the right way , is something i admire			2
’ @entity0 is tempted to move abroad himself , to test himself in another country if @entity135 really has turned its back on him			1
‘ football owes me nothing but i feel i have something to contribute to the game , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t expect people to bend over backwards			0
ideally i would probably like to work abroad and i am at an age where if it does n’t happen now it might never happen			1
maybe football ’s finished with me			2
’ with so much still to offer ? you ’ve got to be kidding .			0
