@entity0 , 27 , is expected to file an appeal with the help of the @entity8 and an outside attorney later today , claiming he notified both the @entity10 and the @entity1 about his altercation back in june of this year			1

sources tell the @entity32 that the football star is also considering possible legal action following his increased discipline from the league , feeling that he has been punished twice for the same offense			2
in his letter to the @entity39 on friday explaining @entity0 's new punishment , @entity27 wrote , ' this video shows a starkly different sequence of events from what you and your representatives stated when we met on june 16 , and is important new information that warrants reconsideration of the discipline imposed on you in july			1
' the commissioner added , ' based on this new information , i have concluded that the discipline imposed upon you in july was insufficient under all the circumstances and have determined instead to impose an indefinite suspension			1
' in the dark : in a letter to the @entity8 , @entity1 commissioner @entity27 claims he was unaware of the severity of the abuse prior to seeing last week 's video support : many fans have rallied behind @entity0 , who feels he is being punished twice for the same mistake public support : @entity0 and wife @entity3 appeared together for the first time since the incident over then weekend , attending a high school football game in @entity70 , @entity71 there has been some debate however over how much @entity27 knew of the situation prior to last monday , with one anonymous @entity76 law enforcement official saying last week he personally sent a tape of the incident to an @entity1 executive in april			1
multiple sources close to @entity0 also back up the story that the athlete was honest and upfront about the events that took place in that elevator last february when he met with @entity27 in june			2
furthermore , under @entity89 of the @entity1 collective bargaining agreement , it states , ' the commissioner and a @entity92 will not both discipline a player for the same act or conduct			0

@entity3 has been incredibly critical of the media in the days following the release of this tape , writing last week on her private @entity118 , ' i woke up this morning feeling like i had a horrible nightmare , feeling like i ’m mourning the death of my closest friend			2
but to have to accept the fact that it ’s reality is a nightmare in itself			0
no one knows the pain that hte [ sic ] media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family			0
to make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing			0
to take something away from the man i love that he has worked his ass of for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific			0
' she continued , ' this is our life ! what do n’t you all get			0
if your intentions were to hurt us , embarrass us , make us feel alone , take all happiness away , you ’ve succeeded on so many levels			0
just know we will continue to grow & show the world what real love is ! ravensnation we love you ! ' mrs. @entity20 also showed her support for another individual under fire from the @entity1 this weekend , saying on @entity154 that the league has no right to tell @entity157 how to discipline his child			2
