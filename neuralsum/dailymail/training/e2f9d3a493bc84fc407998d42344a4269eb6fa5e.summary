it sounds like a fanciful storyline from @entity3 ’s soap @entity4			0
a farmer ’s wife sets up a campaign against her husband ’s plan to erect 40,000 solar panels on their land , and even threatens to leave him			1
however , this everyday tale of country folk is not fiction but a real - life marital dispute between @entity17 , 69 , and her husband @entity18 , 70			1
it echoes a current storyline in @entity4 in which long - suffering wife @entity37 has angered her greedy farmer husband @entity38 by going to a public meeting about a controversial new road he supports			1
but mrs @entity17 appears to be taking matters considerably more seriously , not only spearheading the campaign against her husband ’s plan with a solar power firm , but threatening to leave him			1
she told the @entity48 : ‘ my husband signed the deal without telling me			1
i was killing myself working 20 hours a day lambing and he conducted the negotiation behind my back			0
‘ we live in a beautiful valley and we wo n’t be able to see it if there are solar panels surrounded by 8ft - high fences			2
and it may all go out of fashion			0
it ’s not been a happy situation – i ’d like to kill him			0
i ’ve not kicked him out of the bedroom , though			0
we ’re too old for all that anyway			0
’ @entity17 has written an open letter to the people of @entity69 asking them to back her in her fight to oppose the plans by her husband @entity18 to erect the 55 - acre solar farm on the family land mr @entity74 said last night his wife ’s stance had caused trouble for the whole family and left him deeply upset			1
the row has divided the village of @entity69 in @entity81 , where the @entity82 run @entity83			1
mr @entity74 says he wants to build a secure financial future for his children and grandchildren with the solar panel scheme , which would supposedly provide enough energy for 3,500 households over at least 30 years			1
it is claimed it could earn £ 55,000 a year in government subsidies alone , but mrs @entity17 is bitterly opposed to it			1
despite seeking the help of a cardiologist for angina since the proposals came to light , she insists she is determined to fight the plans			1
in an open letter to the @entity101 , her local newspaper , she thanked those supporting the campaign against ‘ this potential blight to our countryside ’ and urged villagers to write to @entity108 , the chief planning officer at @entity110 district council			1
she wrote : ‘ i am still asking myself : “ what have i done to lead my husband to put money before our marriage ? ” over the course of a year , the solar panels on @entity116 , next to the @entity74 's family home on @entity83 , would generate enough renewable energy to power 3,500 houses ( stock picture ) i ’m married to my husband			2
but i am my own person			0
all the stress has made me quite ill , but everyone i meet says it ’s fabulous that i ’m sticking to my beliefs			0
if the solar farm goes ahead , i ’ve told him i ’ll leave			1
’ she noted that three of their four grown - up children , who have all left home , were not interested in taking over the farm			2
mrs @entity17 said : ‘ only my daughter @entity137 is interested			2
she comes down from @entity138 to help me with the lambing			0
’ mr @entity74 , meanwhile , insisted the children supported his scheme and said it made financial sense			0
he said : ‘ the whole thing has caused trouble in the family			0
it has been very stressful			0
i do n’t want to upset her any more than she wants to upset me			0
‘ it was never my intention to cause friction			0
it ’s a business decision that the farm needs to make for future generations			2
it will also be wildlife friendly			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t know whether @entity17 will leave me if the plan goes ahead or not			1
i would not have undertaken this decision if i did n’t have the backing or interest of my children			2
‘ but @entity17 is against it			2
she thinks she will be able to see it from her bedroom window and it will spoil her view			0
’ other locals opposing the scheme include former formula one world champion @entity165 , whose house overlooks the proposed solar farm			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve been approached by solar companies wanting to build solar farms on my land , but on principle i am against commercial ventures on fields which could be used as farmland			1

@entity17 has said she will leave husband @entity18 over the plans
she has written an open letter to people of @entity69 asking for backing
in it she says : ' if the solar farm goes ahead , i ’ve told him i ’ll leave '
her husband @entity18 , 70 , insists he does *n't* want to upset his wife
says he wants to build a secure future for their children and grandchildren
