letters exchanged between @entity1 , then general secretary of the @entity3 , and @entity4 , the chairman of @entity5 were discovered further evidence of the link between a civil liberties organisation and a child sex lobbying group emerged last night , as letters between @entity1 and the @entity5 were discovered			1
the letters between former @entity12 health minister @entity1 , then general secretary of the @entity3 , and @entity4 , the chairman of @entity5 were discovered in an archive at @entity14			1
in december 1975 , @entity4 wrote to @entity1 asking her to consider @entity5 's views in its policy on the age of consent , which included decriminalising sex with children as young as four			1
his letter was written on @entity5 notepaper and the letterhead featured a logo of two barelegged children sitting on a rock			0
the letter from the @entity5 chairman said : ' as a member of the @entity30 it has come to my notice that the next meeting of the @entity34 is to consider @entity3 policy in relation to " @entity37 " for sexual activity			1
' @entity5 has produced some evidence for the @entity40 on this subject and i have enclosed two copies with this letter in the hope that the ideas contained in our evidence might help the @entity34 reach a decision			2
' @entity1 responded to mr @entity4 , in a typed letter on yellow paper seen by @entity51 : ' thank you for your letter of 16th december			1
my apologies for the delay in acknowledging			0
' we have found your evidence ... most helpful and i think it has certainly been taken into account by the people preparing our evidence			1
' the autumn 1982 edition of rights , the in - house magazine of the @entity3			0
self - confessed paedophile @entity64 's letter was published on page 9 ( pictured centre ) letter exchange : @entity1 seen in 1975 on the @entity68 while she was working for the @entity3 the archive includes a @entity3 briefing note that argues that child pornography should not be outlawed in the 1978 child protection bill , the @entity51 reported			1

miss @entity73 she said the paedophile group ' had been pushed to the margin ' before she began working there the exchange of letters comes after the @entity87 can reveal that in 1979 , an edition of @entity91 , @entity5 ’s official journal , carried the @entity3 appeal for new members in an appalling ‘ @entity96 ’ edition			2
the @entity87 can also reveal that former health minister and @entity3 general secretary @entity1 shared a conference platform with @entity5 leader @entity99 in 1977			1
ms @entity73 and her mp husband @entity100 say @entity5 was banished before she became the @entity3 ’s legal officer in 1978			2

miss @entity73 she said the paedophile group ‘ had been pushed to the margin ’ before she began working there			0
yet , during the year after she took up her post , the @entity3 advert appeared in @entity5 ’s april @entity113 ran inside a shocking 24 - page special edition of the magazine – the cover of which shows a picture of a young boy wearing only a small pair of shorts as he plays tennis			2
