by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 3 august 2013 a @entity2 carpenter who lost four of his fingers in a circular saw accident has invented a prosthetic hand which is made using a 3d printer			0
@entity7 , and his @entity9 design partner @entity8 , are now making hands for people unable to afford normal prosthetic limbs			1
in particular , they have helped young children with a condition called amniotic band syndrome which causes them to be born with a malformed hand			0
@entity7 , who lost four of his fingers in a circular saw accident in 2011 , has invented a cheap prosthetic hand which is made using a 3d printer they hope the hand will eventually be downloaded from mr @entity7 ’ website so people anywhere in the world can make it with the use of @entity29			1
mr @entity7 lost the fingers on his right hand in 2011 but was determined to continue his work as a carpenter			0
he said : ‘ i had two problems			0
one , finding something that 's functional for a tradesman for instance , and second , finding something that was within the reach of normal people - prosthetic limbs are ridiculously expensive			1
’ in trying to overcome these problems he created @entity44 which can be printed , assembled and fitted anywhere in the world			1
it came about after mr @entity7 got in contact with mr @entity8 who had made a mechanical hand prop and posted footage of it in action on @entity54			1
they tinkered and brain - stormed and after many emails , photos , drawings , and skype - sessions , they created their most promising prototype			0
@entity60 , and his @entity9 design partner @entity8 , are now making hands ( pictured ) for people unable to afford normal prosthetic limbs they hope the hand will eventually be downloaded from mr @entity7 ' website so people anywhere in the world can make it with the use of @entity29 ( pictured ) initially it was called @entity71 and allowed mr @entity7 to use the stumps of his lost digits to operate a claw like device			1
during the refinement of the @entity71 , he and mr @entity8 were given two 3d printers to use for prototyping and manufacturing of small parts			1
with these two printers in their possession their focus turned towards the creation of @entity44			2
the first person to benefit from a new @entity44 , made mainly from plastic , was a five - year - old boy called @entity88 with amniotic band			2
@entity44 , which costs about £ 65 , can be printed , assembled and fitted anywhere in the world			1
picture shows mr @entity93 as holding some of the @entity29 printed parts once the 3d printer has produced the parts for the hand , mr @entity7 is able to assemble them ( pictured ) @entity88 , who lives in @entity2 , had no useable fingers but could bend his wrist			2
based on this motion , mr @entity7 was able to build him a hand capable of grasping			0
the only thing that can not be copied is a tendon			0
to solve this problem , the pair created a bungee to return the finger and then a cable to pull it			0
mr @entity7 says he has now made well over a hundred hands for people who do not have the funds to buy a conventional prosthetic			2
the first person to benefit from a new @entity44 , made mainly from plastic , was a five - year - old @entity2 boy called @entity88 ( pictured ) who has a deformed hand @entity88 had no useable fingers but could bend his wrist			1
based on this motion , mr @entity7 was able to build him a hand capable of grasping he is currently in the process of setting up a non-profit organisation to make it easier to accept funds to build new hands			2
he explained there are people all over the world interested in being taught how to make and fit them			2
he said : ‘ hopefully the idea is you teach one , and then the next one gets taught , and further , and it will spread by itself			0
’ he said fitting children with @entity133 was one of the most inspiring applications of this technology			0
mr @entity7 ( pictured working on the design ) is currently in the process of setting up a non-profit organisation to make it easier to accept funds to build new hands he explained that when they go to school they are the coolest kids in the school			0
he said : ‘ kids can be cruel , and they were teased before because they had a shortcoming in the hand , and now that they 've got this @entity44 thing , they 're like the best thing , everybody wants to be their mate now			1
‘ there 's a child in the @entity9 with a standard myoelectric hand that cost £ 37,600 and the child wo n't wear it because there are braces and harnesses , you ca n't get it wet			0
he asked : ‘ how many hands could i have done for £ 37,600 ? ’ he believes the cost of making one of his @entity162 is around £ 65 with prices dropping even further if you print and assemble @entity44 yourself .			1

@entity60 worked with designer @entity8 to create the @entity44
they are now making hands for people unable to afford normal prostheses
they hope people will eventually be able to download the hand from a website so it can be printed anywhere in the world
