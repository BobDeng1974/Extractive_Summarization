by @entity0 most women dream of an hourglass figure - but for @entity4 it has become an obsession			1
inspired by voluptuous cartoon character @entity6 , @entity4 has sculpted her bust to twice the size of her waist			1
in the last two years , 25 - year - old @entity4 has had two boob jobs taking her from an h to an o cup			1
and the military wife has shrunk her waist from 38 to a tiny 23 inches by squeezing into rib - crushing corsets for up to 23 hours a day			1
what a character : @entity4 in her corset at her home in @entity19 , @entity20 the character @entity6 appeared in the hit movie @entity23 in 1988 @entity4 , who has been obsessed by @entity6 since childhood , first wore a corset to take some sexy pictures for her husband and became fascinated by the way it transformed her body but despite her extreme proportions , she has no plans to stop			1
she is now preparing for her third boob job and hopes to double the size of her already buxom bosom			0
' i 've always had a small waist , big hips and large boobs but i 'm kind of a go hard or go home sort of person , ' said @entity4			1
' i wanted to make that significantly more extreme , more dramatic , more stunning and more wonderful			0
' shockingly , the corset is so tight that @entity4 ca n't eat a proper meal whilst wearing it - as her stomach is so restricted			1
in the last two years , 25 - year - old @entity4 has had two boob jobs taking her from an h to an @entity49 cup @entity4 , pictured before she started to wear the corset ( left ) and today with it on ( right ) , says the pain and discomfort of transforming her body into that of @entity56 has been worth it penny on day one of training her body to wear a corset which she wears up to 23 hours a day and has shrunk her waist from 38 to a tiny 23 inches @entity4 admits she is obsessed with big breasts and does n't think her cup size will ever be big enough bending , sitting and lying down can also be a struggle			1
driving is very uncomfortable and any form of exercise is totally off - limits			0
extreme corseting has even been known to rearrange the internal organs , but @entity4 , a pin - up model , is n't worried			1
instead she says the curves of her idol are worth any discomfort			0
' i 've been obsessed with @entity6 from a really early age , ' she says			1
' i think she is incredibly sexy and there 's a real power and strength to her character			0
within the first four months of corset training , @entity4 had lost 15 inches from her waist today @entity4 has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure @entity4 says that her new body has given her confidence after years of low self confidence , and she feels like is wearing protective armour when she is in her corset ' i 've always wanted to copy that - at five i was already thinking about breast implants			1
' @entity91 , who now lives on the small island of @entity19 , @entity20 , embarked on her quest for the perfect hourglass figure two years ago			0
she wore the corset in february 2012 to pose for some saucy snaps for her husband @entity99 , 28 , who was deployed overseas with the @entity100			0
but @entity4 was so fascinated by the effect on her figure that she began corset training - a method that involves shrinking your waist by wearing the tight - laced garment for long periods of time			1
for four months @entity4 wore the corset non-stop , only taking it off to shower			1
@entity4 says it has taken a lot of hard work and dedication and is n't concerned about the effect the corset training may be having on her internal organs the corset is so tight that sitting down is extremely difficult ( left ) , @entity4 is unable to eat a full meal with it on and it leaves deep red marks on her skin when removed ( right ) ' it was tough at first , ' she says			1
' the corset is not a magical tool that will make your waist tiny in a few months			2
' it really was hard work and dedication on my part			0
' i stuck to little meals , and also things that incorporate liquid into the food - like smoothies			0
' one thing that was difficult was not being able to eat my favourite spicy foods - because they would wreak havoc on my stomach when it was restricted in the corset			2
' disturbingly , corset training is known to move around the internal organs , but @entity4 is n't concerned			1
she says : ' the stomach is an incredibly resilient thing - it can withstand being squashed			0
' at first i wore the corset too much and i experienced some pain and discomfort , but now i know how much my body could handle			2
@entity4 , here aged 10 in @entity150 , says she was obsessed with the cartoon character from an early age ' i found it difficult to sleep in the corset at first but it does n't bother me now			1
' within the first four months of corset training , @entity4 had lost 15 inches from her waist			1
in 2012 she had her first boob job , taking her from an already ample @entity159 to a @entity160			0
but @entity4 still thought her breasts were too small			2
' i 've always been obsessed with big boobs , ' said @entity4			2
' the bigger they are the better and i do n't think i 'll ever be big enough			0
' a year later @entity4 went under the knife again to boost her assets a further five cup sizes			2
today @entity4 has a 26inch waist and a 55inch bust and is proud of her figure			1
she said : ' i love my body and my shape but i 'd still like to have more extreme proportions			0
' i 'd never consider surgery anywhere but my breasts - but i 'll keep having breast surgery until my boobs are as big as possible			0
' although she still wears the corset every day , it is only occasionally that she puts it on for 23 hours at a time			1
and @entity4 's new shape has dramatically improved her self - confidence			2
she explains : ' i 've suffered with body image issues and low self - esteem for most of my life			0
' but when i wear a corset i feel like i 'm in armour or wrapped in a safety blanket			2
' when out of the house , @entity4 often finds herself surrounded by admirers who want to have their picture taken with her			2
@entity4 's husband also embraces her severe curves			2
despite receiving intense criticism from some people and even death threats , @entity4 says she has no intention of stopping @entity4 poses with local @entity6 fans dressed in her corset on the streets of @entity19 , @entity20 he said : ' @entity4 is as close to @entity6 as any mere mortal can get			1
' her shape is exciting and interesting			0
i do n't like the ordinary or the generic			0
' @entity4 does have her critics , however , and has experienced negativity about her look online			0
she said : ' some people do n't agree with what i 'm doing - they say i 'm destroying my body and it does n't look natural			0
' i 've even had death threats , but my appearance is for me and i love the way my body looks			0
' @entity6 's figure is sensual , strong and extreme and it 's a pleasure to replicate that in real life			0

@entity4 has been obsessed by @entity6 since childhood
