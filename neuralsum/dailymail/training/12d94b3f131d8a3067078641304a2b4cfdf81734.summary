@entity0 have been stunned after @entity1 demanded a @entity3 record fee of £ 75million for @entity4			1
the @entity5 international has made the @entity8 champions aware that @entity9 is his preferred destination and said goodbyes to his team - mates on saturday with @entity0 growing increasingly confident of clinching a deal but the price - tag has come as a shock			1
they had expected a valuation of up to £ 56m , similar to the figures discussed by rivals @entity21 last week , but @entity1 , sensing @entity0 's desperation to land a stellar signing , have upped the price			1
@entity1 's president @entity46 sees @entity4 as their best chance to redress their summer spending and the 26 - year - old 's departure would also allow them to bring in another @entity52 player in @entity53 from @entity54			2
they know @entity0 have money to spend and want to use that to squeeze out as much as possible			0
it would represent a huge profit on the £ 20m they paid @entity60 for @entity4 in 2010 and , coupled with his £ 180,000 a week wages , represent a huge outlay for @entity0 - smashing the current @entity3 record of @entity64 's £ 50m for @entity65 in 2011			1
@entity1 coach @entity66 has confirmed @entity4 said goodbye to his team - mates ahead of the impending move			2
' @entity4 has not trained with us today and he came in to say goodbye to the players and people at the club , ' @entity66 told a news conference in @entity1			0
' there is nothing official yet but it is being sorted out			0
the decision is his and the club has done what it could to keep him here			0
' busy : @entity0 boss @entity79 wants to strengthen his squad before the close of the transfer window @entity83 is up : @entity4 is expected to be a @entity0 player if the club can agree a fee with @entity1 the two clubs meanwhile are also in discussions over a deal for @entity0 's young right - back @entity90			1
the 21 - year - old was @entity93 's first official signing from @entity94 for £ 1.75m but @entity1 want him to join up with @entity95 and their b team @entity97			0
they have asked for a loan which could become a permanent £ 4m deal .			0
