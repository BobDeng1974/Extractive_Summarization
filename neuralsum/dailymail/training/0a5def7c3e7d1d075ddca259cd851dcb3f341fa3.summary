a @entity1 hero whose medal citation was lost by senior officers has been refused an award – despite a high - profile campaign by his family , mps and @entity8			1
the family of corporal @entity10 , 27 , say the soldier was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death in the battle of @entity15 in june 1982			1
but because the handwritten citation was lost , the exploits of @entity17 , of the @entity18 , the @entity19 ( @entity18 ) , have gone unrecognised			1
bravery : corporal @entity10 , 27 , was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death , his family say his family ’s hopes were raised last year when defence minister @entity28 announced a fresh inquiry , but they have now been told that the review found no evidence that a citation was written			1
his brother and son furiously dispute this conclusion , while this newspaper has seen documents which appear to challenge the inquiry ’s findings			1
these include a letter to @entity17 ’s commander , lieutenant general sir @entity42 , written just days after the battle			0
in it , another @entity18 officer , major @entity47 , writes : ‘ you have read my citation			2
prior to his death , he led his section like a demon on the rocks of @entity15			0
this was @entity10 at his best			0
’ the inquiry dismissed this reference to a citation , and also ignored the recollections of general sir @entity42 , who is adamant that a medal recommendation was written at the time			2
how or when the citation was misplaced remains unclear			0
last night , @entity17 ’s brother @entity59 , 53 , from @entity60 , said : ‘ we have had a battle royal with the @entity63 who have been hellbent on refusing @entity10 a medal no matter what evidence we put forward			1
a commemorative plaque at @entity15 , @entity1 , where @entity68 died in june 1982 ‘ the letter from @entity70 to general sir @entity42 makes clear reference to a written citation			2
how can they dismiss it out of hand ? i am disgusted but the fight for justice for my brother will continue			0
’ an @entity63 spokesman said last night : ‘ the investigation was conducted to identify any material not previously available and found no new information , but again noted the courage displayed by him			0
' it found no contemporaneous evidence that he was treated differently from the other servicemen who were considered for an award			0

corporal @entity10 , 27 , was a member of @entity18 , @entity18
he was recommended for medal hours after his death in 1982 , says family
but soldier *'s* handwritten citation was lost and he has gone unrecognised
family has since been told there is no evidence that a citation was written
his brother and son seriously dispute conclusion after an inquiry as held
