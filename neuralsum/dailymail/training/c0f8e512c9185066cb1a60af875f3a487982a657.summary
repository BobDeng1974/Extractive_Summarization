by @entity0 the idea of coming out to your parents or loved ones by way of a digitalised recorded message from @entity7 may seem the pinnacle of bizarre , but that is precisely what makers of a new app propose			0
celebrity @entity13 has 40 celebrities on its books , including @entity7 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 , who will record bespoke , personalised messages for anyone for a modest fee ( from £ 10 - 100 )			1
the makers say they expect most of the messages will be for things like @entity26 , @entity27 , good luck on your exams , or the occasional proposal of marriage			0
sign up to get @entity7 , left , to tell your folks something you ca n't face doing yourself , or maybe choose @entity18 , right , instead @entity38 celebrity @entity13 has 40 celebrities on their books personalized messages for anyone for a modest fee however they also envisage the app will be used to convey other messages			1
as well as being use by people who want to come out about their sexuality , the app could be used to heal a family rift ( for who could resist the wisdom of the @entity7 ) or to encourage a dieter on their weight loss journey			0
in fact any of the 40 celebrities will say anything you wish for a set price			0
but not all celebrities are created equal , and a few seconds of talk from @entity7 will set you back $ 100 ( or about £ 70 ) , while a message from @entity64 ’s ex @entity18 is a bargain at just £ 15 , while former hear say singer @entity66 is a rather specific £ 27.50			2
just $ 100 , or about £ 70 can buy you the @entity7 on a screen , for a few seconds actor and singer @entity17 is just one of the 40 or so celebrities who have already signed up to the website other stars who have signed up to the venture include @entity72 ’ @entity73 , @entity74 : @entity76 actor @entity75 , and presenter and dj @entity78			1
once you have paid , you simply say what message you want recording and the video will be sent to you in between ‘ a few days to a few weeks ’			0
however , if your chosen celebrity has gone all diva and is taking too long to record your message , you can cancel your request and get your money back			2
still in its early stages , celebrity @entity13 hopes to continue to expand and bring more celebrities on board .			1

new website allows you to *pay* celebrities to record a message
celebrity @entity13 has 40 stars on its books
they will record anything from happy *birthday* to personal messages
