it is the exclusive @entity1 playground of the ultra-wealthy – a real - life fantasy island where nothing is too much trouble for its elite guests			1
@entity8 ’s idyllic @entity7 promises a-listers privacy and discretion , as well as the sort of unparalleled luxury that £ 40,000 a night buys			1
but now some of the secrets of the @entity17 paradise hideaway can be revealed , including the bizarre lengths staff go to in ensuring that their moneyed guests ’ every whim is satisfied			1
one employee – an accountant – has told how she allowed guests to eat sushi off her naked midriff			1
other visitors are encouraged to hit golf balls at a human target ; while male serving staff have been asked to perform their duties ‘ shirtless ’			1
‘ @entity7 is a place where people can draw up the drawbridge , let their hair down and relax , ’ the @entity54 mogul says			1
the approach seems to work , since the island ’s guests have ranged from princess @entity63 and @entity64 to @entity65 and @entity67 ’s @entity66			1
in a new @entity75 documentary , offering a rare glimpse at how the rich and powerful spend their holidays , one member of @entity7 ’s accounts team , @entity70 , speaks of how she let guests eat sushi off her body for a birthday party			1
she originally suggested ‘ eating sushi off a hot girl ’ to some guests – not intending to be the human plate herself			2
but that is exactly what happened , causing some discomfort in the @entity1 sun.			2
. @entity70 , originally from @entity89 , said : ‘ the sushi got really , really quite warm and stuck to me , so that was interesting			0
i love that i get to be an accountant and do this stuff and then go and lie on a table and have people suck soya sauce out of my belly button			0
who else gets to do that ? ’ @entity103 ( left ) , an accountant on the island , allowed guests to eat sushi off her stomach			1
right , another gorgeous worker @entity7 promises @entity109 privacy and discretion , as well as the sort of unparalleled luxury that £ 40,000 a night buys according to @entity7 ’s @entity115 chef , @entity114 , it ’s vital that the staff serving the food are as ‘ sexy ’ as the dish			2
a waiter explains to the @entity75 : ‘ my role today is to look after the kayak in the pool – being sexy in the pool			0
about ten minutes before the guests come we will fill the kayak with palms and flowers and chopsticks and then we add the sushi to it			0
then i ’ll jump in the water , float about and people will jump in the pool and have fun , have drinks and eat the sushi			0
i might have a cocktail or two , sneaky ones , as well			0
’ sir @entity8 , who bought @entity7 for just £ 180,000 in 1978 , says : ‘ we once had a new management team that came and they brought in two rules			1
the first was that staff can not drink with the guests and staff may not have relationships with the guests			2
that management couple lasted one weekend			0
that is not the way this island would work or run very well			0
’ one member of @entity8 ’s team tells the programme that the tycoon is a ‘ matchmaker ’ who makes it a mission to look after the girls who are ‘ gorgeous and single ’			2
@entity7 accommodates only 30 guests at a time but these @entity164 have access to more than 100 staff			2
regular visitors say the attractiveness and attentiveness of the staff are reasons they keep coming back			0
@entity8 says staff are free to drink with guests and even have relationships with them , as part of the carefree atmosphere @entity178 - born property developer @entity177 , who was on her 21st visit to the island , said : ‘ none of them are bad on the eyes			1
they are all pretty good - looking			0
’ another @entity178 guest , called @entity188 , is shown enjoying a game of ‘ sumo golf ’ , in which he and other guests shoot golf balls at a member of staff who bounces up and down on an offshore trampoline , while wearing protective clothing			1
patch , from @entity198 , said the game uses balls made from soluble fish food rather than the real thing			0
but it was boiling hot inside the human target ’s costume , and he later has to apply an ice pack to his neck			0
in other scenes , a couple ask for a massage on the trampoline in the sea , while a group who are sharing a hot tub ask if the waiter can serve their pina coladas ‘ shirtless ’			0
sir @entity8 ’s mansion on the island was hit by a lightning strike in 2011 and burnt down , but it has since been rebuilt at a cost of £ 9 million			1
@entity223 ’s @entity222 : @entity224 will be broadcast on @entity225 on january 6 at 9pm .			0
