by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor drug addicts caught with @entity5 substances like heroin and cocaine should not be ' chucked ' in jail , @entity2 has claimed			1
the deputy prime minister said it was ' utterly senseless ' that people who needed treatment were instead thrown behind bars when found with small amounts of drugs for personal use			1
but the @entity17 insisted the courts need to have the power to imprison serious offenders who cause ' the most harm in our communities '			0
he has called for a @entity35 to examine all drug laws , something @entity33 rejects			0
now mr @entity2 has vowed that at the next election the @entity37 will promise to abolish prison sentences for drug possession			1
mr @entity2 said : ' drugs do untold harm to individuals and to communities			0
we need a radically smarter approach if we are serious about tackling this problem			0
' @entity37 believe the first step is to recognise that drug use is primarily a health problem			1
addicts need treatment , not locking up			0
it is a nonsense to waste scarce resources on prison cells for cannabis users			1
' simply chucking people into prison and turning a blind eye is the lazy option because all it ends up doing is making the problem worse			1
heroin addicts are to be given foil for free in a bid to encourage them to inhale the drug drugs paraphernalia will be given to heroin addicts for free by the government in a bid to deter them from injecting the substance			1
users will be given free foil to help them heat up the class - a drug in an attempt to encourage them to inhale it and thereby avoid the risks of contracting diseases such as @entity81			1
aluminium foil is used to warm heroin and breathe in its fumes to get high			1
under current laws health professionals are banned from giving out foil to addicts , but the new rules , thought up by the @entity17 , would end this practice			1
the scheme is likely to draw criticism from anti-drugs campaigners for fear it could encourage people to take drugs			1
' ' i 've always believed that if you 're anti-drugs you should be pro-reform			0
that 's why we will ensure nobody will go to prison where their only offence is possession of drugs for their own personal use			0
' instead these people should receive non-custodial sentences and addicts should get the treatment they need to stop using drugs			1
' these reforms will ensure that drug users get the help they need and that taxpayers do n't foot the bill for a system that does n't work			2
' more than 1,000 people a year in @entity120 and @entity121 are jailed for possession of drugs for their own personal use			2
mr @entity2 says half are for possession of cannabis , but says millions of people know ' intuitively that it does not make sense chucking a 22 - year - old into prison for the possession of cannabis			2
the people who should be behind bars are the criminal gangs , the mr @entity137 '			1
he argues that the @entity138 should approach the drug problem as a health rather than a law and order issue			2
in a swipe at mr @entity33 's party , he said the @entity144 were slow to realise that it was time to rethink drugs laws			0
mr @entity2 added : ' the conservatives are what it says on the tin â€” they are conservatives			2
they take a long time sometimes to move with the times			0
' if there was evidence that banging them up works then all their misplaced tough talk would be justified			0
but it does not work			0
' the @entity37 manifesto will include a commitment to end the use of imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and move the drugs and alcohol policy lead from the @entity17 to the @entity168			1
in addition , the party will promise to establish a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches , including further work on diverting users into treatment or into civil penalties that do not attract a criminal record , which can seriously affect their chances of employment			2
however , the @entity17 defended the current law			0
a spokesman said : ' drugs destroy lives and cause misery to families and communities and this government has no intention of decriminalising them			0
' the vast majority of people caught in possession of an illegal drug are not imprisoned , with only 3 per cent of offenders found guilty of a drug possession offence last year being sentenced to immediate custody			2
' it is vital that the police and criminal justice system have a range of measures available to them , including community - based interventions			0
' but law enforcement and the criminal justice system must also have the tools to deal robustly with serious and repeat offenders who cause the most harm in our communities			0

@entity37 leader says it is ' utterly senseless ' to impose custodial sentences
he argues people need to be treated not ' chucked ' behind bars
plan is @entity37 policy and has not been *agreed* with the conservatives
