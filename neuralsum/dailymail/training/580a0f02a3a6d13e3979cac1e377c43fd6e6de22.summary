by @entity0 they say that true love is hard to find			2
but as it is revealed that millions of us have actually been struck down by @entity6 's arrow after just one glance , perhaps in reality it is not as hard as previously thought			1
a new study has found that a third of us have fallen in love at first sight - suggesting that we are still a nation of romantics			1
sadly much of this love remains unspoken , with one in six brits falling head over heels for a work colleague but keeping their feelings under wraps			1
and 11 per cent of men even confess losing their heart to a friend ’s wife or girlfriend , but never letting on			1
love at first sight ? a third of us say we have been struck down by @entity6 's arrow at first glance , a new study has revealed the research found that in an age of social networking internet dating we still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter			1
and 60 per cent of @entity17 have never had a one night stand as they hold out for @entity40 or mrs right			1
unfortunately , there is often a difference between what we want and what we get , the study by flower delivery company @entity42 revealed			2
while 41 per cent of women insist a handwritten card or letter is the way to their heart , men are more likely to profess their undying love by text			1
one in five @entity57 men ( 19 per cent ) have said ‘ i love you ’ by @entity58 , compared to just 17 per cent who have actually written it in a letter			2
one in five ( 20 per cent ) believe love should be declared with flowers , while 10 per cent say a poem is most romantic			0
the research into modern relationships , conducted in the run up to @entity70 , found the notion of love at first sight is far from dying out			0
not only do 31 per cent say they ’ve been struck by @entity6 ’s arrow , but this rises to 37 per cent among those aged 55 and over			1
romantics : we still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter , the study found more than a third of us - 38 per cent - have fallen in love at work , but 16 per cent have felt unable to tell the object of their affection			1
and 11 per cent of men admit having carried a torch for a friend ’s wife or partner			1
psychologist dr @entity94 , of the @entity95 , said : ' it seems a lot of people spend time thinking about being a relationship with someone other than their partner			0
' it ’s very easy to romanticise what a relationship could be like			0
' perhaps it ’s not surprising we might fall for people we work with as we see them daily and we usually see them on their best behaviour			0
' we may also see friend ’s partners when they are at their best - while out , dressed up and sociable , perhaps making an effort to be more humorous			2
' but of course we all worry about the ramifications of falling for someone in the workplace , such as seeing them every day if we are rejected			0
' with the partner of a friend or family member the ramifications could be even greater			0
' this type of undeclared love could be upsetting and prevent a person from moving on and finding true happiness			0
' the study , of 2,000 people , found that 12 per cent have sent a @entity130 ’s card or gift to someone other than their partner while in a relationship			0
in addition , six per cent of men confess to sending themselves one just to make their wife or girlfriend jealous			1
in contrast , 16 per cent of women have sent a card to a friend to cheer them up			0
@entity145 , marketing director at @entity42 , said : ' technology plays an increasing role in the way we communicate but when it comes to saying " i love you " we prefer loved ones to take the traditional approach			2
' huge numbers meet through dating sites and use new media but it ’s reassuring to hear we love to receive a handwritten note and still fall in love at first sight			2
' it indicates we are a nation of romantics , even though the research suggests many have not yet felt able to tell the object of their desire how they really feel			0
' it ’s also fascinating to see how many people send @entity130 ’s cards and gifts to people other than their partners , such as to cheer up a friend			0
