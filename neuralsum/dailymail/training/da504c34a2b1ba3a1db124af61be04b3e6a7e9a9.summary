by @entity0 @entity2 bosses have been accused of trying to ‘ cover up ’ a mistake that delayed paramedics delivering potentially life - saving treatment to an eight - year - old boy who suffered a fatal asthma attack			1
@entity8 started struggling for breath while suffering a serious asthmatic episode at his grand ­ mother ’s house in @entity13 on the evening of march 14 last year			1
his grandmother immediately called 999 for medical help			1
@entity8 suffered a serious asthmatic episode at his grandmother 's house in @entity13 last year but an inquest was told on thursday the operator mistakenly logged the call as a ‘ green ’ code case , which allows ambulance crews more time to reach a patient , rather than a ‘ red ’ coded life - threatening emergency			1
the error meant that paramedics took 23 minutes to reach the schoolboy – arriving around six minutes after he died , despite efforts to resuscitate him by a family friend			1
last night , @entity8 ’s mother @entity31 accused @entity32 ( @entity32 ) of trying to ‘ cover up ’ the mistakes made on the night of his death			1
her comments came after @entity37 , acting manager of @entity32 emergency centre , changed her evidence on the night before the inquest			0
a catalogue of errors is being blamed for eight - year - old @entity8 's death from an asthma attack mrs @entity37 originally submitted a statement to the coroner in june last year saying there were ‘ no appro ­ priate resources ’ to send when the call came in at 7.17pm			1
and she said in a letter to mrs @entity31 that no ambulance was ­ available until one was eventually dispatched at 7.29			0
but , on wednesday , mrs @entity37 said she wanted to change the @entity32 statement because further study of its records showed a rapid response vehicle was ready at 7.21			0
she said that , because @entity8 ’s grandmother ’s call was wrongly coded green , this ambulance went to another less serious incident involving a toddler rather than @entity8			2
@entity8 's mother , @entity31 has accused @entity32 of trying to ' cover up ' the mistakes made on the night of his death mrs @entity31 , 31 , said : ‘ when they sent me the letter in the first place they told me they had done all the investigating they could and that the conclusion they came to was that there were no other ambulances available			1
‘ when she [ mrs @entity37 ] came up with the extra evidence i just thought it does look like they ’re trying to cover it up			0
’ the inquest was told that , if the ambulance available had been sent at 7.21 it could have reached @entity84 by 7.27 or 7.28 , offering paramedics a window of between six to eight minutes to treat his asthma attack before he collapsed			0
because @entity8 's grandmother 's call was wrongly coded green , the ambulance went to another less serious incident but instead a team was sent just before 7.30 , arriving at 7.40 – some six minutes after his heart stopped			2
the inquest was told that the 999 operator , who has more than two years ’ experience , misheard @entity8 ’s grandmother and thought she said he could speak between breaths , when in fact he could not			2
mrs @entity31 , who has two other sons , said she believed the delay in the paramedics ’ arrival played a part in the death of @entity8 , who had suffered seven serious asthma attacks previously and survived			2
offering her condolences to the family , mrs @entity37 said the mis - coding of the call was a ‘ tragic mistake ’			0
the inquest has been adjourned until next june so that medical experts can be called to determine whether earlier treatment could have saved @entity8 ’s life			0
mrs @entity31 ’s lawyer , @entity118 ­ beck , a clinical negligence expert from @entity121 and @entity122 law firm , said : ‘ on behalf of @entity31 and her family , while the conclusion of the inquest would have been pref ­ erable to allow for some closure , the coroner has made the correct decision to adjourn and seek further evidence to ensure the inquiry will be as full and fearless as it should be			0
