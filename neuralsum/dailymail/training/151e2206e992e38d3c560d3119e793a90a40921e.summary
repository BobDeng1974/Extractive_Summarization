by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 2 september 2013 it was a permanent reminder of one of the @entity4 's bloodiest battlefields , a scale model of the opposing lines created in an @entity8 field for the education of @entity11 troops			2
now a dig to uncover the model built by @entity15 prisoners of war which long since has become covered by earth and foliage is set to start			1
archaeologists will begin charting the site , the only example of its kind left in the @entity23 , which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the @entity26 on the @entity27 , fought in june 1917			1
archaeologists will begin charting the site of the @entity30 model of the @entity26 , @entity31 , which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the war experts said the terrain model was built not only as a training aid for other soldiers at @entity38 , in @entity30 , but in recognition at the horrific toll of slaughter the battle - fought around the landmark @entity26 - took on the brigade			1
the ridge formed an anchor in the @entity15 front lines but the week - long offensive of infantry attack , aerial bombardment and heavy shelling resulted in an @entity52 victory with four @entity53 awarded to @entity55 soldiers for bravery during the fight			2
the terrible human cost of the battle ran to 50,000 men killed , wounded or missing across both sides			1
the battle was fought in the build - up to the much larger and far bloodier @entity65 offensive which would begin in july of that year			0
recreation : the battle field was recreated by veterans as well as @entity15 prisoners of war in the battle 's aftermath			0
it was one of the @entity4 's bloodiest battlefields during the construction of the model battlefield , the @entity75 brought in its @entity79 field bakers to feed those involved in painstakingly rebuilding the war - zone @entity83 , in a project funded by @entity82 , is going to make a record of the model for future generations before re-covering the site on @entity88 in october			2
councillor @entity89 , county council leader , said @entity30 was proud of its military heritage as the home of the @entity92 and now was the right time to carry out the dig with the centenary of the war 's outbreak falling next year			1
he said : ' we see ourselves very much as custodians of the land and of the memories it holds , and this is a wonderful opportunity to bring the site back to life			0
' an @entity106 was even erected for the project at @entity38 , @entity88 , as the reconstruction of the war - field began to take shape the model was built by @entity15 prisoners of war , supervised by the @entity114 , and then rendered in concrete			2
it includes small - scale reconstructions of @entity120 village 's buildings , including its church , together with trench positions , railway lines , roads , and accurate contours of the surrounding terrain			2
mr @entity89 said : ' the idea to build a scale model was a stroke of genius and undoubtedly played a huge role in preventing the deaths of thousands of more men			2
then : men were set to work digging trenches in the field designated as a model for the battle zone in @entity139 now : archaeologists will have their work cut out for them to return the overgrown @entity88 area to its former replica model of the @entity120 terrain battlefield ' due to the location , scale and fragile nature of the model it is impossible for it to be moved or left uncovered , but for a brief moment in time we all be able to share with the nation , memories of a piece of @entity30 which helped change the course of history			1
' preparatory work on the site is starting today with the dig taking place next week			1
the @entity26 took place on the @entity27 in june 1917 in @entity31 , around the village of @entity120 the @entity26 was a major offensive conducted by the @entity75 , under the command of general @entity165 , on the @entity27 near the village of @entity120 , @entity31			1
six army corps were involved in the offensive - three carried out the attack , two remained on the northern flank and one was available at short notice if needed			0
the offensive forced the @entity173 to move reserves to @entity175 from the @entity177 and @entity178 fronts , which relieved pressure on the @entity180			0
morale among @entity183 troops was low after the @entity185 offensive in the preceding months failed to achieve its aims			0
the tactical objective of the attack at @entity120 was to capture the @entity15 defences along the length of the ridge , which ran from @entity192 in the south through @entity120 and @entity194 to @entity195 , to deprive the @entity15 @entity196 of the high ground south of @entity198			0
troops from the @entity75 fought in the @entity26 , which took place along a ridge running south from @entity198			1
pictured , men marching to trenches near @entity198 in october 1914 the @entity23 defences were positioned behind the ridge and back areas further north , from which the @entity23 intended to conduct the ' @entity208 ' - to advance to @entity65 , then capture the @entity31 coast up to the @entity211 frontie			1
they included numerous divisions from @entity214 and @entity114			0
the @entity15 @entity196 divisions of @entity216 held the ridge ; they were later reinforced by a division from @entity218			0
the battle began with the detonation of 19 mines , which devastated the @entity15 front line defences			0
the forces then followed with a creeping barrage , 700 yards ( 640m ) deep , which allowed the advancing @entity23 troops to secure the ridge with support from tanks , cavalry patrols and aircraft			0
@entity23 attacks from 8 â€“ 14 june advanced the new front line beyond the former @entity15 line			0
the @entity26 is considered a prelude to the much larger @entity65 campaign , the preliminary bombardment for which began a month later , on july 11 1917 .			1

model was built as a training aid for soldiers and in recognition of the fallen
@entity26 took place around the @entity31 village in june 1917
a total of 50,000 men were killed , wounded or missing from both sides
