the @entity0 : myths and doubts surround @entity0 dame @entity3 has hit out at two acclaimed @entity5 actors who believe the @entity0 was not the true author of the plays			0
the actress said it was ' strange ' that sir @entity10 and @entity11 took the ' haughty ' view that they were penned by an @entity15 aristocrat			1
she said it was ' snobbish ' to believe that the writer could not have been a playwright from @entity19			0
@entity10 claimed the dramas were written by @entity21 , the 17th @entity22 , who hid behind @entity0 because , he said , a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright			1
while @entity11 , currently performing in @entity25 at the @entity26 , has pointed out that details about @entity28 in the plays are ' exact ' and the @entity22 had widely toured the country			1
@entity3 , who has starred and directed in many @entity0 dramas , said she got ' mad as a snake ' over the myths and doubts about the man regarded as the world 's greatest poet and playwright			1
she told the @entity39 : ' it annoyed me … i suddenly felt like @entity41 riding into battle			0
' she described last year 's film @entity44 , which portrayed @entity0 as a drunken fool and the @entity22 as a literary genius , as ' far - fetched ' and a waste of money			0
in her new book , @entity49 , @entity3 devotes a chapter to ' conspiracy theories ' surrounding @entity0 who died at the age of 52 in 1616 after writing 37 plays , 154 sonnets and poems			2
she wrote : ' you have to be a conspiracy theorist to imagine the earl secretly wrote 37 plays , performed and printed over a quarter of a century , without being found out			1
@entity0 defender : @entity3 claims @entity10 and @entity11 had a ' haughty ' view of the playwright acclaimed : @entity11 in @entity0 's drama @entity64 and award - winning @entity10 ' and you have to be a snob if you just hate it that the greatest poet the world has produced was born into the humble aldermanic classes of a provincial town			1
' she added : ' how strange it is that @entity10 and @entity11 , hundreds of years later , with their outstanding acting instincts , should embrace such a haughty view of the man who has made them as big as they are			1
' we have seen a dozen times how thrillingly they themselves can conjure up fantastical character studies of fictional persons – without ever having been crowned king or murdered a rival in real life			0
' it 's what actors do for heaven 's sakes , and @entity0 was one too			0
' star : @entity10 in @entity97 's @entity0 's @entity96 with @entity98 as his queen doubts have surrounded @entity0 's authorship for 150 years , with @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity21 named as the likely writers of his sonnets and plays			2
last june , @entity10 said that @entity0 was just a ' frontman ' for the @entity22			2
he said : ' the simple fact is the earl could not be seen as a common playwright			0
he was living in a @entity111 - type @entity110			0
' @entity11 , said the ' big thing ' in the @entity22 's favour was his wide knowledge of @entity28 where 14 of of bard 's plays are set			2
he said : ' you would expect a playwright who set 14 of 37 plays in @entity28 to have been there , and the knowledge is exact			0
