over the past year the number of thefts related to @entity6 has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to @entity1 immigrants			1
there were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year , up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012			1
be vigilant : over the past year the number of thefts related to @entity6 has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to @entity1 immigrants other card payment machines , such as railway station ticket machines , are also being targeted			1
the techniques involved are crude yet they can generate huge windfalls , with card fraud for 2013 expected to reach £ 400million			1
gang members using distraction techniques have been behind the rise in cashpoint thefts			2
the thieves will often crowd round atms and read pin numbers before stealing the card			2
they are then able to drain the victim 's account			0
often the elderly and the most vulnerable are the targets			0
as the number of these distraction thefts has soared , thieves have started deploying the scam in shops , railway stations and cafes			2

a wide array of scams that have been deployed at cashpoints across the country include : spring traps - once a card has been inserted , these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the atm from retracting it			1
cash traps - claw - like implements are inserted into cash - dispensing slot to ' capture or skim some of the dispensed bills '			2
jammers - an oversized fork - like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal @entity6 transaction			2
skimmers - thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers			2
the data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at @entity6 along with victim ’s pin to withdraw cash			2
transaction reversal fraud - involves ' tricking ' atm into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the @entity6 to pay more than the balance available			1
can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them			0
gang members will crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four - digit pin , then distract them to steal the card			1
in some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user			0
someone reads the pin over the victim ’s shoulder and then , when they have moved away , retrieves the card			0

they are spending it on a lavish lifestyle , flash cars , flash houses			0

’ another scam used by the gangs see them calling people at home pretending to be from the security department of their bank			0

’ scam : @entity285 avoided jail last december despite being involved in a £ 3m cash machine fraud a @entity1 man involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £ 3 million and with 9,000 potential victims walked free from court			1
@entity285 helped to fit ' skimming ' devices on cash dispensers , which downloaded the card details of those who used them			2

police investigating @entity285 said they discovered 9,000 different card accounts on a computer they seized			2
detectives estimated that the network to which @entity285 belonged had access to at least £ 3 million , based on the average fraud per card for typical skimming offences			1

those details were then sent on an email to another man			0
@entity285 , of @entity339 , @entity340 , told police he was ' at the bottom end ' of the operation , and that the ' big boys operated out of @entity346 '			2
