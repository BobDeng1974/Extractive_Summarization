a corrupt policewoman who seized @entity1 of a street fight in an attempt to blackmail footballer @entity4 was jailed for 22 months today			1
@entity5 , 32 , a former pc with @entity6 , took the footage by ' flashing her warrant card ' to the manageress of a bank which was intended to be used to extort money from the @entity13 star			1
the film showed friends of @entity4 , the then - @entity16 captain , involved in a bar brawl near his home in @entity19 , @entity20 , which spilled out on to the street			1
jailed : former @entity22 @entity5 ( pictured above ) , 32 , was imprisoned for for 22 months today after seizing @entity1 in the hope she could blackmail @entity4 local businessman @entity24 , 35 , claimed the midfielder ' threw the first punch ' but , at an earlier hearing , prosecutors said the @entity13 midfielder was acting as a peacemaker on the evening of august 4 2013			1
jailing her today judge @entity31 told the defendant : ' this was deliberate and calculated misconduct in a public office			0
' you deliberately created a false impression in the mind of the bank manager that you were investigating a criminal offence			0
' in fact you were on a mission to obtain that matter so that you could put it either directly or through an intermediary , who would use it for his own ends , which were nothing whatsover to do with a criminal investigation			0
' judge @entity31 said while @entity51 may not have known who , eventually , the @entity1 would be passed to or for what purpose , it had caused @entity13 's @entity4 and his friend @entity54 ' serious personal embarrassment ' , and damaged the reputation of @entity6			1
plot : @entity51 planned to use the cctv to extort money from mr @entity4 , pictured with his wife @entity59 , who was filmed acting as a peacemaker when friends got involved in a bar brawl @entity51 made no reaction as she was jailed , though she had wept earlier when her lawyer recounted some of the ' trauma ' she had faced while on duty as a police officer			1
@entity51 , formerly of @entity19 , now living in @entity70 , @entity71 , did not deny improperly using her status as a police officer to get the @entity1 and admitted misconduct in a public office but claimed she was doing a favour for a friend			2
but during a three day hearing , known as a trial of issue last november , judge @entity31 said he found her account ' wholly implausible ' , ruling @entity51 acted for ' base motives ' and described her as a ' practised and persistent liar '			2
he said the @entity1 was secured to use it ' possibly as a lever to cause mr @entity4 to pay money to suppress it or , at the very least , to use it in a way which would potentially cause embarrassment , as has in fact occurred '			1
@entity51 , who joined the police in 2005 , was off - duty and on a career break when she went to the @entity97 branch in @entity19 and took the footage , which the prosecution claimed was for ' criminal purposes '			2
earlier the court heard @entity51 got her hands on the cctv to allow mr @entity24 or another person , to use it as a ' lever ' to cause @entity4 to pay money to suppress it or use it in a way to cause him potential embarrassment			1
crime scene : the @entity20 police officer took the footage by ' flashing her warrant card ' to the manageress of this @entity19 bank mr @entity24 claimed @entity4 and his friends assaulted him , and following the incident the footballer and his friend mr @entity54 , faced ' demands and threats ' amid an atmosphere of ' unpleasantness ' and ' menace ' with claims of money being offered by the press for the footage			1
@entity4 was later named in legal papers lodged by mr @entity24 at the @entity129 claiming damages following the disturbance			0
the civil case named @entity4 , his wife , @entity59 , and mr @entity54 , as defendants			0
but @entity135 , prosecuting , said mr @entity24 , who gave evidence at the earlier hearing , was ' an untruthful witness who sought to exploit his involvement in this incident and he maintained his deceit in the witness box '			0
the prosecutor added : ' there is still no extant proceedings in the @entity129 , which given his performance in the witness box , is hardly surprising			0
' mr @entity135 said the actual cctv , which has never been made public , was a ' side issue ' in @entity51 ' admitted offence of misconduct			0
@entity4 's lawyers and @entity13 became involved and police called in with their investigation leading to @entity51 's arrest and her resignation from the police			2
@entity156 , mitigating for @entity51 , said : ' we are dealing with a single event in which a serving police officer on a career break took a decision to essentially , catastrophically bend the rules to breaking point and in doing so , broke them			0
' this is a shameful and criminal aberration			0

@entity5 , *33* , used her warrant card to get footage from a nearby bank
@entity22 took @entity1 on *behalf* of potential blackmailers of @entity4
@entity173 showed street brawl involving friends of then @entity16 captain
but court heard that mr @entity4 was ' acting as the peacemaker ' in fight
@entity51 ' defence team argued that she was *unaware* of any criminal purpose
but judge *rejected* the claims and jailed her for 22 months today
