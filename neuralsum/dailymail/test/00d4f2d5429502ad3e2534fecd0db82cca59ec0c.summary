@entity0 launched a new @entity2 wireless service today that switches between @entity3 and cellular networks @entity0 is already the world ’s most popular phone software provider , and a pay - tv operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier			1
the company has unveiled a @entity2 wireless service that switches between @entity3 and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low			2
the service , called ' @entity15 , ' debuted today , about two months after @entity0 revealed its plans to expand its ever - growing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphones			2
@entity0 is selling the basic phone service for $ 20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month , instead of a flat rate			1
each gigabyte of data will cost $ 10 a month			0
that means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gigabytes of data and get $ 20 back if only one gigabyte was used in a month			1
most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without refunding any money			2
@entity36 initially will only be sold to a narrow @entity2 audience that owns the @entity38 6 , a smartphone that @entity39 made with @entity0 's help			2
@entity0 's pricing setup makes @entity15 less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity43			1
the monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gigabyte of cellular data at those carriers range from $ 45 to $ 50 compared to $ 30 from @entity0			2
the major carriers , though , offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than @entity15			0
those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data			0
rather than building its own network , @entity0 is leasing space on cellular towers built by @entity43 and @entity47 , which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to @entity15			1
to use the service , @entity38 6 owners must sign - up to request an invitation , must have a @entity77 address , and must live in a @entity2 zip code within the coverage area			1
in this map , the dark green areas are covered by the service 's @entity82 , the lime green is covered by @entity85 and the pale green by @entity87 @entity44 @entity89 coverage is pictured for comparison			0
@entity15 will be hosted through @entity43 and @entity47 's networks the service will work only on the company 's @entity38 6 phones and only in the @entity2 @entity15 will be hosted through @entity43 and @entity47 's networks			1
overall , it costs $ 20 for basic service , which includes unlimited domestic talk , unlimited texting , tethering , and access in 120 countries			1
customers pay $ 10 per gb of data			0
data is paid for in advance , and the cost of unused data gets refunded rather than rolled over or lost			2
phone numbers will live in the cloud so that consumers can talk and text on any connected tablet			1
calls can be made via @entity113 on @entity114 , @entity115 , and through @entity77 on desktops , via the @entity113 widget			0
texts can be made and received in the same way			0
there is no annual service contract required when you sign up to use the service , @entity38 6 owners must sign - up to request an invitation , must have a @entity77 address , and must live in a @entity2 zip code within the coverage area			1
@entity0 is promising @entity15 will automatically switch over to an available @entity3 if that is running at a higher speed than the cellular alternatives			0
@entity47 ceo @entity131 , whose company already has been cutting its prices and rolling out new options , said it was a ' no - brainer ' to work with @entity0 on @entity15			1
' anything that shakes up the industry status quo is a good thing — for both @entity2 wireless customers and @entity47 , ' @entity131 wrote in a blog post			2
@entity0 has an incentive to promote cheaper and faster wireless service as a mobile virutal network operator			0
this is because it operates some of the world 's most popular online services , including its search engine , maps , @entity77 and @entity150 video site			0
the @entity152 , @entity153 , company believes most people will visit those services more frequently if they are enticed to stay online for longer periods , giving @entity0 more opportunities to show the digital ads that generate most of its revenue			0
similar motives prompted @entity0 to begin building high - speed , hard - wired networks capable of navigating the internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than existing broadband services			0
although @entity0 is only selling its broadband service in a handful of @entity2 cities so far , @entity46 and @entity166 are now offering options with comparable speeds in a few communities			0
price in dollars : this graphic shows how much @entity0 's new @entity15 will cost for various plans			0
for @entity177 only , the @entity0 carrier will cost $ 20 a month as compared to $ 35 for new partner @entity47			1
however the savings really start when @entity180 of @entity89 is consider - with the internet search giant 's plan coming in at $ 70 and telecom giant @entity44 's costing $ 110 a month @entity15 initially will only be sold to a narrow @entity2 audience that owns the @entity38 6 , a smartphone that @entity39 made with @entity0 's help			1

@entity15 will be hosted through @entity43 and @entity47 's networks
it costs $ 20 for basic service and unused data is paid back to customer
the invitation - only service will work only on @entity38 phones in the @entity2
numbers will live in the cloud so users can talk on any connected tablet
