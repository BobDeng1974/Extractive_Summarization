by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:29 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:29 est , 19 december 2013 drama : @entity4 , played by @entity5 , with @entity6 time to can that cliche about @entity9 being middle - class twee			1
his slick new musical has f - words , drug - dealing and a silver - service orgy involving a bare - buttocked aristocrat in a gimp mask and a pinny			1
who does he think he is ? @entity20 ? some scenes in @entity6 have a projected image of a big chandelier thrown high on central drapes			1
it is a surprise some trouserless @entity26 is not swinging from it with his floozy , even while singing one of those classic @entity9 reprises a semi-tone higher than its predecessor			1
@entity6 ( played by @entity7 ) was the @entity33 osteopath who in 1960 introduced war minister @entity34 ( @entity35 ) to sexpot @entity4 ( @entity5 )			1
his circle also included a vodka - swilling @entity39 diplomat , @entity38 ( @entity38 )			2
did the minister betray secrets ? no , sings @entity4			1
in his ‘ lust , warheads were not much discussed ’			2
but @entity45 ’s finest went into orbit			0
@entity34 was finished , the @entity47 fell and the unfortunate @entity48 ( or deluded pimp ? ) @entity6 killed himself			1
most dramatic art demands the suspension of disbelief			0
this fiery polemic argues , all too convincingly , that @entity6 was a ‘ human sacrifice ’ in a ‘ political revenge trial ’			1
a political revenge trial ? biased judges and warped lawyers ? in @entity58 ? it could never happen now ! moving on sharply before we prejudice any current trials , this grown - up , richly produced , strongly scored musical has a timeless topicality			1
@entity65 coppers , lying parliamentarians , a bed - hopping elite and grubby newspapermen			2
we have n’t changed much in half a century			0
one drawback is that the @entity70 story is over-tilled soil			0
another is that this sex - for - larks episode was so lacking in innocent romantic love			2
the exception was the steadfastness of @entity34 ’s wife @entity77			1
her forgiveness of her husband gives the show its best tingle moment , mrs @entity82 ( @entity83 ) singing ‘ i ’m @entity84 ’			0
that moving song and a zippy number called ‘ 1963 ’ – a ‘ hey there @entity92 ’ soundalike sung with perhaps too much aggression by @entity4 and her friend @entity89 ( @entity90 ) – sound the best bets for posterity			1
the central melody , much repeated , begins with an octave leap and has a meandering descent			0
it , too , worms its way into your head			0
the mocking march ‘ @entity104 ’ ( echo : ‘ you ’ve never had it so often ’ ) is also catchy , even if the joke was pinched from an early issue of ‘ private eye ’			0
praise : this is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing the show starts with hypnotic woodwind as @entity6 ’s ghost steps out of the @entity117 ( @entity118 branch )			1
his waxwork image has been placed here alongside acid murderers and @entity122			0
‘ i never expect this , ’ he admits			0
soon we are in the haunts familiar to anyone who knows the @entity70 / @entity4 story : @entity129 ’s night club , where @entity4 was a dancer			2
and the @entity131 house where @entity6 and @entity4 set up ( platonic ) home			1
@entity4 and @entity34 meet by the pool of lord @entity135 ’s stately home , @entity136			1
we do not see the water but its ripples are cleverly reflected from behind a wall			0
miss @entity5 and mr @entity38 strip , he doing some pleasing comedy while hiding his crown jewels			0
director sir @entity143 has drilled his troops well			0
there is a completeness to this show			0
you sense you are in the hands of master craftsmen			0
did composer @entity9 have to rummage around in an increasingly empty tune box ? that would be a harsh judgement			2
this is , however , the work of an artist in his later phase , both shadowed staging and the music being brushed by a sceptical world - weariness rather than the vaulting , full - lit optimism of innocence			2
this is a powerful musical not about revolution but about defeat and decay and it is well worth seeing .			2
