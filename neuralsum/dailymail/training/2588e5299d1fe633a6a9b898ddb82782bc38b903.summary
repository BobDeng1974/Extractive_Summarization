dark horses two , dark forces nil			2
@entity2 can now join @entity3 in watching the @entity4 from home , banished not by @entity6 or a dastardly @entity8 conspiracy , but a young man who has proved it is possible to play football from the heavens , without simultaneously dragging the game into the gutter			1
@entity15 , now the tournament top scorer , made it five goals in four @entity4 games for @entity19 , including what may prove to be the highlight of this @entity4			1
it is human nature to hope that we have not seen the best already , but it is also possible that tonight we did			2
any contender for goal of the tournament will have to go some to top the strike that put daylight between these teams after 28 minutes of stalemate			2
before @entity2 had a chance to respond after regrouping in the dressing - room , @entity35 – known throughout @entity19 by his first name – followed it with a beautifully - worked second four minutes after half - time , and the contest was over			1
but the @entity41 midfielder struck twice in the last 16 clash with @entity2 and now has five goals in the tournament and leads the race to be the top goal scorer			1
@entity15 is now as short as 2 - 1 to end the @entity4 with the @entity59 it was a match of karmic delight			1
@entity19 got what they deserved : a quarter - final date with @entity74 that will leave the hosts more than a little apprehensive ; @entity2 got what they deserved : nothing and the bum ’s rush to the airport			1
they were confirmed as a one - man team , their shameful indulgence of @entity3 ’s worst excesses exposed as nothing more than a shield to cover their own inadequacies			1
@entity2 must tolerate @entity3 , for without him they offer so little			1
they have played 22 @entity4 matches with him since 2010 and have lost five			1
they have played five without him in that time , and lost four			2
once he was gone it was a matter of time before they followed			2
how fitting that the architect of their downfall was the player of the tournament so far , 22 , but looking younger , an @entity101 , playing with a smile not a snarl			2
man of the moment : @entity15 celebrates his goal as @entity19 beat @entity2 pick that one out : @entity15 celebrates his wonder goal @entity35 ’s bite in @entity74 has come from having decisive influence on @entity19 ’s impressive progress , not a malevolent act of aggravated harm , and it was fitting that @entity2 ’s unlovable apologists were removed from the competition by his wit and talent , an elevation of football ’s spirit that was met with joy in the fitting surrounds of the @entity124			1
by the end , the @entity125 in the crowds were reacting angrily to @entity41 mockery of their limitations			0
many turned up with their @entity3 masks and chants and a well - honed victim mentality encouraged by their coach @entity136 , but it was not enough			1
they will depart feeling hard done by , but were not			0
the good guys , too			0
@entity19 are deserved quarter - finalists and @entity74 will not look forward to facing them on this evidence			1
@entity35 in particular , is an exquisite talent , a player of true fantasy , capable of scoring a goal to grace any game , in any competition , and certainly worthy of this famous stadium			0
the execution was close to perfect			0
at the double : @entity15 puts @entity19 2 - 0 up with a close range strike in it goes : @entity15 scores his fifth goal of the tournament dream land : @entity15 dances with team - mates @entity157 , @entity159 and @entity160 the play was switched from one flank to the other , for a cross headed out by @entity2 ’s @entity164			1
it was put back in , hopefully , by @entity166 and fell to @entity35			0
he took the ball on his chest , pivoted , checked his position and volleyed it with his left foot from 20 yards			0
the ball dipped over @entity49 ’s despairing hand , struck the crossbar – as the greatest - looking goals often do – and bounced down and over the line			2
fans of a certain age may know this as a @entity179			0
there were cheers when it went in , but gasps for the many replays			0
it was a special goal , one that will be replayed , revisited and savoured throughout the coming weeks			0
@entity19 ’s next , while not as spectacular , was equally well worked			1
marching on : @entity19 fans celebrate as their side beat @entity2 and progress to play @entity74 @entity189 : @entity19 fans back their country in the @entity124 another lovely passing move found its way out to @entity193 and his deep cross was met by the impressive @entity159 , unselfishly cushioning a gentle header back into the path of @entity35 , who finished smartly from close range			1
@entity19 eased off after that , but without fear of reprisal			1
@entity201 , @entity2 are snarky , but toothless			1
their captain , @entity202 , managed to get booked for complaining from the substitutes bench , which seemed appropriate			0
@entity35 will turn 23 on the eve of the final if @entity19 stick around , and has now scored in every game of @entity19 ’s four , the first player to perform this feat in the competition since @entity211 and @entity212 for @entity74 in 2002			1
the two @entity213 ’s – there was a third , of course , in @entity216 – were playing for the eventual world champions , though			0
a free - scoring , free - wheeling @entity219 team , dragged from the wreckage of a horrid qualifying campaign by @entity222 and transformed into something quite miraculous			0
on a different level : @entity19 out classed @entity2 as @entity160 has a shot at goal first to the ball : @entity159 beats @entity2 's @entity228 to the ball @entity35 , by contrast , is not playing for one of the world ’s superpowers , or tournament favourites – certainly not since @entity235 was invalided out of the action towards the end of last season			1
yet he currently tournament top scorer having started the competition the same price to win the @entity59 as @entity242 , who made it onto the pitch for three minutes in a single game against @entity2			1
who says the @entity248 are deluded ? @entity235 , a powerful striker of the type that is so popular right now , was seen as crucial to @entity41 hopes and , without him , it was feared @entity253 ’s team would be shorn of their cutting edge			2
now they have to be considered an outside bet for the competition such is the optimism inspired by @entity35 ’s form			0
he scores , he creates , he torments , he tests			2
face in the crowd : @entity2 's fans hold up cardboard cut outs of suspended @entity3 the joke 's on you : @entity2 fans wear fake fangs and a dog mask to mock @entity3 's bite against @entity270 already a £ 37.5m player after moving from @entity271 to @entity272 , he may well yet be one of the stellar transfers in @entity8 this summer , on the back of this campaign			1
a goalscorer , a match - winner , a classic number ten but with the heart and energy required of the modern game , he has looked a cut above many of the more famous names on display in @entity74 and has now scored in @entity19 ’s last six matches			1
who could afford him – and , of those that could , who would n’t want him ? out here , in the international game , @entity74 would love him , so too @entity293 or @entity294 and @entity270 have nothing like him , either			0
@entity248 ? well , we ’d find a way of ruining him obviously , but that ’s not the point			0
@entity35 has been a thing of beauty at this @entity4 and @entity74 will not enjoy dealing with his invention in @entity304 next friday			2
it is often said that @entity222 ’s team it stronger defensively than going forward , and it will need to be			0
yet @entity19 showed they could defend , too – not least enforcer and captain @entity308 and goalkeeper @entity309			2
their passing was , at times , superb , producing enthusiastic cries of ole from their fervent , colourful support			0
@entity74 , obviously , intimidate their continental rivals , as was shown in yesterday ’s penalty shoot - out with @entity319 , when all confidence seemed to drain from @entity322 ’s men			0
@entity19 will need to overcome those feelings of inadequacy , too			2
yet one player , at least , has nothing to feel inferior about			0
@entity35 is being mentioned in the same breath as some of the greatest players to ever wear @entity74 ’s yellow shirt			0
he is having the tournament of a lifetime			0
come july 12 , he may have a lot more to celebrate than just turning 23 .			0

@entity15 scores wonder volley to send @entity19 through
