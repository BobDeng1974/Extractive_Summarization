@entity0 has admitted @entity1 has ' slipped back a bit ' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party 's supporters has waned			1
but the @entity1 leader said he expects to recover momentum in the run - up to next month 's election as its key campaign issues like @entity14 membership are now very much ' back in play ' with voters			1
mr @entity0 is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the @entity29 in @entity34 , @entity35 - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his @entity38 rival just two months ago			1
speaking on a tour of the @entity45 , he added : ' we are exactly where we were last august , having won the @entity49 elections - we were on 14 - and - a - bit per cent			0
' we won the @entity49 elections , we found that level and we did have a rally in the @entity52 through the remarkable events of first @entity54 and then perhaps more remarkably the @entity55 by - election ' we 've slipped back a bit since then , there are 30 days to go and i think the issues @entity1 is campaigning on are back in play			1
' mr @entity0 poses for a selfie with a group of girls during a visit to @entity66 , near @entity67 in the @entity68 the @entity1 leader was joined on the campaign trail by a car painted in his party 's colours of purple and yellow @entity0 is facing a possible libel case from a former @entity1 mep who defected to the conservatives			1
mr @entity0 attempted to play down @entity78 's decision to switch sides in january by insisting that the former communities spokesman had already been sacked over alleged financial irregularities and claims of the employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business			1
solicitors ' firm @entity87 confirmed it has sent a ' letter before action ' to @entity1 warning of @entity93 action against the party and its leader			2
mr @entity78 , who was elected @entity38 for the @entity97 and @entity98 region in the 2014 @entity100 elections , is awaiting a response and no date has been set for a court case			2
a @entity1 spokesman said the party was making no comment on his case			2
after quitting @entity1 in january , mr @entity78 branded mr @entity0 's party ' pretty amateur ' and accused it of a ' ridiculous ' lack of policies			1
questioned at the time about mr @entity0 's accusations , chancellor @entity111 said he was ' absolutely comfortable ' about mr @entity78 becoming a @entity38 mep			1
mr @entity0 described the party 's support as having ' peaks and troughs ' , adding : ' share prices have peaks and troughs , we all have peaks and troughs			1
he blamed the poll slip in recent months on a declining sense of euphoria from members and said : ' there was a degree of slightly euphoric @entity1 support round about the time of the result of @entity55 , which was a remarkable event			1
' but he added : ' the trend over the last week is we are beginning , as the short campaign for the @entity137 has begun , the vote is beginning to harden			0
' during a campaign stop in @entity67 , mr @entity0 spoke out against so - called ' super mosques '			1
proposals for a mosque in the town that will accommodate 750 worshippers have been the subject of a long - running battle between the local council and the local @entity149 association			0
asked about the row , mr @entity0 said he preferred ' smaller and proportionate mosques '			1
he said : ' people need places of religious worship			0
it 's just a question of whether that scale is the right one or not			0
' i 'm not going to for one moment advocate that we should ban people from being able to worship their religion			0
i think it 's very important they do			0
' whether super mosques are the way forward is a separate question			0
i personally do n't necessarily think it 's a great idea			0
' i would rather see more smaller and proportionate mosques going ahead			0
' mr @entity0 also expanded on his controversial remarks in the televised leadership debate last week that foreigners with @entity172 should not be allowed to come to this country for free treatment			1
he said that he believed people with cancer and tuberculosis should also be stopped			0
' @entity172 is one of the big one , cancer and certain resistant strains of tuberculosis , which you ask the doctors about , they have got some real problems , ' he said			0
mr @entity0 leaves an election campaign event in @entity187 , central @entity188 , after becoming stuck in traffic ukip sources privately admitted raising the issue in the tv debate , which drew criticism from other party leaders , was part of a ' shock and awful ' strategy to shore up the party 's base			1
but @entity1 's poll rating has not shown any signs of picking up following mr @entity0 's outburst - with some experts predicting it will fall below 10 per cent by the time of the election			1
the latest national polls have put the conservatives and labour virtually neck and neck			0
a @entity212 poll on sunday had the @entity29 on 34 per cent , one point ahead of @entity214 , and @entity1 in third place with 13 per cent of votes			2
a poll in @entity38 - held @entity34 – where mr @entity0 is running for @entity100 – shows him in second place , and pollsters now believe @entity1 will win just a handful of seats			1
@entity222 , pictured in @entity223 today , has issued an impassioned plea for @entity1 voters to ' come back home ' to the conservatives speaking yesterday in @entity227 , @entity222 conceded that he understood the ' frustrations ' of @entity1 voters			1
it is a significant peace offering by the prime minister , who once dismissed @entity1 as ' fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists '			2
he said to those who had left the @entity38 fold : ' look , we 've heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we 'll change those things			0
come with us , come back home to us , rather than risk all of this good work being undone			2
' but there are deep concerns that support for @entity1 , fuelled by the @entity38 ' failure to meet their pledge to cut immigration to ' tens of thousands ' , could swing enough votes in other seats to hand @entity250 a victory			2
mr @entity222 , who also promised a referendum on @entity49 , said the government had turned around the economy and cut taxes for working people			1
' to keep generating the jobs and the growth our country needs , come back to us , come back home to us , ' he pleaded			2
the @entity230 warned those who voted for ' a minor party ' risked ending up with @entity250 propped up by the @entity264 's @entity263 , ' driving him into even more spending , welfare unlimited , debt bloat '			0
mr @entity222 said the prospect of a minority @entity214 government held in power by the @entity264 was a ' nightmare scenario ' and said the @entity38 ' need ' @entity1 support			1
' we are 23 seats short from an overall majority , ' he said			0
' we can provide that clear , decisive and frankly more accountable government that a majority conservative government would deliver			0
we need those 23 seats			0
' mr @entity0 immediately attacked the prime minister and said he would not win @entity1 voters back			1
he said former @entity214 and @entity38 voters have found a ' more authentic home ' where they do not get ' roundly abused by their hosts '			0
meanwhile , the ' defection ' of a @entity38 parliamentary candidate to @entity1 descended into farce yesterday when it was revealed he had already been dropped by the conservatives			2
@entity0 hailed the move by @entity291 as a ' hammer blow ' for the pm			2
but the @entity29 said the candidate for @entity294 and @entity295 had been ' sacked ' for threatening to stand as an independent .			0
