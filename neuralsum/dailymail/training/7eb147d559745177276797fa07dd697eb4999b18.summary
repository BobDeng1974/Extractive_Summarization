at this point , her hair was styled in a neat bun and she was wearing a cropped black exercise top with a plunging cleavage			2
it 's harder to tell how much make - up she is wearing in these photos as they are taken further away than her last , more intimate photos			2
but , her gym - wear and make - up ( if she 's wearing any at all ! ) is starkly different to her normal ensemble			2
an hour before she uploaded her first gym picture , @entity0 appeared to be topping up her tan while getting in the mood for exercise by wearing a sporty visor			1

her platinum blonde hair falls to one side , and while she is perhaps wearing a little bit of make - up , she looks uncharacteristically natural			2
her incredibly slender waist and protruding ribs , however , are a cause for concern			0
worrying : the self - professed @entity48 's very slender waist and protruding ribs are a cause for concern her drastically slimmed down figure is apparent as well in another selfie she posted , this time wearing a hot pink bra and underwear			0
in the photo , @entity0 is turned to the side , and her stomach appears concave			1
below the image , she posted a link to a work - out video starring @entity133 sensation @entity132 , who is known for her pert derriere and passion for fitness			0
@entity0 recently courted controversy for claiming that interracial couples are the reason behind an increase in cosmetic surgery because they are ' making the human race uglier '			1
workout look : the 28 - year - old looks pensive in a selfie in which she wears a black sports bra and earphones questionable views : @entity27 ( pictured in another relatively natural photo ) recently courted controversy for claiming that ' racial mixing ' is the reason behind an increased interest in cosmetic surgery â€˜ remember how many beautiful women there were in the 1950s and 1960s , without any surgery ? ' she said in an interview with @entity161			1
' and now , thanks to degeneration , we have this			0
a @entity166 marries an @entity167 , they have a kid , a cute girl , but she has her dad 's nose			0
she goes and files it down a little , and it 's all good			0
' her comments sparked a furious outrage among readers , but @entity0 looks none the wiser in another selfie she posted in which she wears a black and white sports bra			2
all dolled up : @entity0 's mother @entity181 apparently inspired her daughter ( pictured ) to lead the ' astral ' life that has made her so famous worldwide the blonde looks pensively downward , with earphones in her ears and minimal make - up on her face			1
she strikes a similar pose in another photo posted yesterday , which sees her sitting in a car with a grey sweater on			0
