by @entity0 ' real problem ' : chief constable @entity2 , the head of the @entity3 , says half of front - line policing is spent dealing with online crime online abuse is behind the majority of complaints to police about anti-social behaviour and harassment , a top officer has warned			1
@entity2 said comments on social networking sites such as @entity16 and @entity17 are the basis for ‘ at least half ’ of calls about nuisance crimes			1
the chief constable , who leads the @entity3 , said low - level crime has moved online along with shopping and banking			1
he also signalled fears that petty insults and threats now take up a disproportionate amount of police time – but said that many officers still struggle to identify when it breaks the law			2
‘ police officers ca n’t deal with every bit of nonsense or disagreement that occurs on social media and there is a line that needs to be drawn , ’ he said			2
‘ if someone is genuinely threatened or at risk , that ’s an issue we need to take on			0
‘ the challenge for officers is to establish what is a criminal act and what is not			0
’ the @entity3 is currently conducting research into exactly how much crime begins online , with some forces voluntarily ‘ flagging ’ incidents in their databases to help gather evidence			1
about 6,000 officers are also undergoing training through the college in how to deal with online offences			1
mr @entity2 added : ‘ officers dealing with less serious crimes and anti-social behaviour might deal with a dozen calls in a typical day – and they tell us that at least half of reports of this type , whether around abuse or threats of assault , may be related to social media			1
‘ we need to ensure that officers have the right skills and training to make these judgments so that we can direct resources appropriately and protect those who genuinely need our help			0
’ senior officers have raised concerns about a surge in those who expect police to settle trivial online spats			2
targeted : @entity82 was bombarded with rape and death threats by @entity85 , 23 , and @entity86 , 25 , after leading a campaign to have a woman 's face on the new £ 10 note they compare many of the comments to people simply ‘ shouting at each other in the street ’ – and say they have even been contacted by some complaining that they have been ‘ unfriended ’ by someone on @entity16			0
yet at the same time , police are determined to crack down on serious offences , including stalking and threats of rape or other attacks			0
last year the @entity105 issued guidelines saying those who post offensive messages online must cross a ‘ high threshold ’ before being brought to court			0
messages may also be a crime if they are ‘ obscene , grossly offensive or false ’			0
the stronger measures to deal with online harassment follow a series of high - profile cases involving abuse on @entity17			1
they include the jailing of @entity85 and @entity86 in january for sending death threats to feminist campaigner @entity82 , who described the experience as ‘ terrifying and scarring ’			0
future : mr @entity2 added that , at some point , every investigation conducted by police will have some online element to it with online abuse becoming an increasingly significant part of day - to - day policing , the law has also developed in order to punish those who target victims over the internet			1
the measures have led to several prosecutions and has even seen some trolls jailed			0
according to the @entity141 , the criteria for an insult to be treated as offence including :			2
