@entity0 could be cleared of the honeymoon murder of his new bride and be on his way back to @entity4 within days , according to one of @entity7 's top legal experts			1
the state 's case against the wealthy businessman is ' riddled with inconsistencies ' and could collapse before @entity0 , 34 , even has to face tough questions in the witness box			1
leading defence attorney @entity14 said the two ' star ' state witnesses against the accused had been particularly ' poor ' and his legal team had a ' more than reasonable ' chance of having all charges against him dropped			1
@entity0 is accused of arranging the murder of his wife @entity0 ( right ) four years ago @entity0 denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride , @entity31 , almost four years ago during their honeymoon to @entity7			1
the state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £ 850 ( @entity40 , 000 )			0
the driver , @entity41 – who spent his sixth day on the stand – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates @entity44 - based @entity0 in his @entity47 wife 's death in november 2010			2
but during gruelling cross-examination , @entity0 's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in @entity41 's story , highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after mrs @entity57 suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck			1
@entity60 , who heads the defence team , also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating @entity0 in the murder			1
mr @entity60 also poked holes in the evidence of hitman @entity70 , hired by @entity41 via a middle - man , who was the state 's second witness and also received reduced prison time in exchange for giving evidence against @entity0			1
the state alleges @entity0 plotted his new wife 's murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £ 850 ( @entity40 , 000 ) mr @entity14 said : ' the two key witnesses - @entity41 and @entity82 - have brought really the only testimony that counts in this trial and the quality of their evidence has been poor and riddled with inconsistencies			1
' the overall quality of the prosecution case we have heard so far has not been high			0
there is nothing for the defence team to lose by bringing the application to have the case against their client discharged and i think they would have a strong reasons for doing so			1
' if @entity0 were my client , i would certainly go down that route			0
' even though the state is not duty bound to prove @entity0 had a motive for killing his wife , evidence of the businessman 's secret gay life was a cornerstone of the prosecution 's case to demonstrate he had a compelling reason to want out of his new marriage			1
however , much of that evidence went unheard when judge @entity115 ruled in favour of @entity0 to exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the gay escort paid by @entity0 and known as the @entity121 master and the first cousin in whom @entity57 had confided intimate details about their unhappy relationship			2
mr @entity14 said he rated the defence team 's chance of any discharge application as ' more than reasonable ' , which would see @entity0 going home to @entity44 and cleared of all charges without ever having to give his version of what happened on the night his wife was murdered			1
' discharging a case is not something that judges do lightly , but judge @entity115 is a bold judge and she does not tend to be cautious			0
' the high - profile nature of the case would not influence her decision			0
i think if they brought a discharge application , the chance of success is more than reasonable , ' mr @entity14 added			0
if no discharge application is brought - or the judge rules that @entity0 does have a case to answer - the defence team will have to decide whether or not to call the businessman to the witness box to talk about the mysterious events surrounding his wife 's killing , and to be cross-examined by the state			1
this poses a further dilemma to @entity0 's lawyers			2
' bringing an application to discharge the case is a much easier decision to make than the one about whether or not to call your client to give evidence , ' mr @entity14 added			2
' although it is not down to him to prove his innocence , a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence			0
' the driver , @entity41 – who spent his sixth day on the stand – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates @entity44 - based @entity0 in his @entity47 wife 's death in november 2010 mr @entity60 said he had ' not yet decided ' if he would make a discharge application , under section 174 of @entity7 's @entity177			2
the prosecution is expected to call just two or three more witnesses , two of them police officers			0
@entity180 , who was approached by @entity41 to recruit killers to carry out the contract hit , is expected to be called next by the state			0
@entity180 was given immunity from prosecution in return for giving evidence against @entity41 and hit men @entity70 and @entity189 , who died two weeks ago while serving 18 years for his part in the killing			0
however , last week it emerged in court that @entity180 had recently made a fresh statement to police about the events of 13 november 2010 – it is not known if this new version helps or hinders @entity0 's defence			2
@entity31 was found shot dead in an abandoned minibus but since @entity180 never met and spoke to @entity0 directly , it is likely his team will try to have his testimony entirely excluded as heresay or severely restricted			2
certainly , the body language of @entity0 and his family , who have been in court every day , has lightened since the trial began a month ago			0
on the first day , @entity0 's lawyer read out an ' explanation of plea ' to the court in which @entity0 claimed to be bi-sexual and admitted using the services of gay prostitutes , including festish specialist @entity215 , surfing gay porn sites and frequenting gay clubs			0
the admission , which followed previous @entity0 denials of being gay and threats to sue mr @entity215 for giving an interview about their sex sessions , undermined the prosecution 's case that his parallel life and fear of being found out prompted him to take extreme measures to be free of his wife			1
it also enabled the defence team to argue that @entity0 's sexuality - no longer in dispute - should have no bearing on the case against him			1
as a consequence , mr @entity215 was flown from @entity4 to give just a few minutes ' uncontested testimony , and a bundle of 53 sexually - charged emails sent to @entity0 from an unidentified older male lover were also excluded as evidence			0
a source close to the case observed , ' @entity0 was unable to be extradited from @entity4 for three years due to his high levels of trauma and depression , but within four months of arriving in @entity7 , he was cleared by the doctors as fit to stand trial			0
' does this mean that doctors in @entity7 can work miracles , or is it because he was sufficiently reassured by his legal team that the case against him was weak and they advised him just to get the trial over and done with ? ' meanwhile , with the fourth anniversary of the @entity47 engineer 's brutal murder a little over a week ago , the question about why @entity57 was killed appears no closer to being answered - a terrible blow to her parents @entity261 and @entity263 , and brother , @entity265 , who have sat through every minute of the case so far			0

leading defence attorney says state 's case is ' riddled with inconsistencies '
@entity14 said two ' star ' state witnesses were particularly ' poor '
@entity0 denies five charges relating to death of his new bride , @entity31
@entity14 believes the defence team could even have the case discharged
