by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:18 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 24 september 2013 charged : @entity2 was arrested for making the leak of classified information to an @entity1 journalist as well as the distribution of child pornography a former @entity9 explosives expert has been charged with leaking the classified information about an upgraded underwear bomb involved in a foiled terrorist plot in @entity13			1
the leak led to a second controversy as it was revealed that the attorney general ’s office seized the @entity1 ’ phone records when they were trying to discover the reporter ’s source			1
@entity2 has plead guilty of revealing the information			0
he was also charged with distributing child pornography and now faces a total of 11 years and eight months behind bars for the two crimes			2
the @entity25 said in a statement that its pursuit of @entity28 was made easier by the child pornography investigation , but that @entity2 was not identified as a suspect in the leaks case until after investigators had analyzed the @entity1 phone records and compared them to other evidence in their possession			1
the deal is the latest legal action in the @entity40 administration 's aggressive pursuit of people it believes have revealed government secrets , including seeking records and even testimony of journalists who prosecutors believe were given classified information and then published stories about it			1
the information @entity2 gave to the @entity1 revealed that @entity53 intelligence agencies had learned that @entity55 ’s branch in @entity13 hoped to launch a spectacular attack using a new , nearly undetectable bomb aboard a @entity53 - bound airliner around the anniversary of @entity61 's death			1
the @entity1 's may 7 , 2012 , story attributed details of the operation , including that the @entity9 had the bomb in its possession , to unnamed government officials			2
tracked : the appearance of @entity2 's email on a child pornography site helped investigators look into him but so did the fact that he appeared on @entity1 call logs that were seized by the attorney general 's office @entity75 director @entity74 has called the leak ' irresponsible and damaging , ' while attorney general @entity77 said the story was the result of ' a very serious leak , a very grave leak			1
' the intelligence officials argue that even though the terror plot had already been thwarted , by leaking the information it prevented the agencies from pursuing their leads further an potentially disrupting other planned attacks			0
just over a year after the story appeared , on may 10 , the @entity25 informed @entity1 that it had secretly obtained nearly two months of call records for more than 20 telephone lines used by @entity1 reporters and editors , including some who worked on the story			2
the news cooperative protested the government 's actions as chilling to investigative journalism and the company and its reporters did not cooperate in the investigation			0
@entity1 chief executive @entity102 called the records ' seizure a ' massive and unprecedented intrusion ' into how news organizations gather the news			0
the court records do not identify @entity1 or name the reporter who communicated with @entity110			2
controversial : attorney general @entity77 's office approved the seizure of a widespread collection of @entity1 and other news organization 's phone records in searches for leaks by government agents @entity2 spent 25 years as an @entity9 special agent bomb technician and worked on major cases involving terrorist attacks , the government said			1
he retired in 2008 , but was rehired as an @entity9 contractor and kept his ' top secret ' security clearance and access to the @entity9 lab in @entity128 , @entity129			0
in court papers , @entity2 said he visited the @entity9 lab on the morning of may 2 , 2012 , at the very time that @entity9 experts were examining the bomb			2
@entity2 shared that information with a reporter the same morning , the government said			0
the @entity1 story ran five days later , on may 7 , 2012			0
the news organization had initially agreed , for several days , to the @entity40 administration 's requests to hold off on publishing it			0
the child pornography investigation did not become public until may 11 , when the @entity9 searched @entity2 's home and seized a @entity145 laptop from his truck in the driveway			1
the @entity9 said it found 30 photos and videos of child pornography on the computer and @entity2 was arrested the same day			1
the government said it began investigating @entity2 for child pornography after an email address linked to him popped up on a known child - porn web site			2
admitting guilt : @entity2 entered a guilty plea on monday for both the leaking and child porn charges and he will face 11 years and 8 months in prison @entity2 apologized in a brief , three - sentence statement that his attorneys released on his behalf monday afternoon			0
' i am deeply sorry for my actions , ' he said			0
' while i never intended harm to the @entity53 or to any individuals , i do not make excuses for myself			0
' the @entity25 said it had already had in its possession , as part of the child pornography investigation , @entity110 's cell phone , computer and other electronic media , including a cd / dvd containing classified information			1
but the department said in a statement that it was able to link @entity28 to the unauthorized disclosures about the @entity13 plot only after investigators had analyzed the seized @entity1 phone records and compared them to other evidence already in their possession			1
based on the analysis , they were able to get a search warrant for a new and more thorough look at his phone and computer , the department said			0
around the same time that the government told @entity1 its phone records had been obtained secretly , court records were made public that showed that prosecutors had obtained a search warrant for the emails of @entity201 reporter @entity200			1
the government says @entity200 received secret information about @entity204 from @entity206 adviser @entity205 , who faces criminal charges over the alleged disclosure			0
@entity205 's case is among seven the administration has brought against people suspected of providing classified information , more than under all previous presidents combined .			2

@entity2 was arrested and charged with leaking classified information and distribution of child pornography
@entity110 is a former @entity9 agent and he used to be an explosives expert
