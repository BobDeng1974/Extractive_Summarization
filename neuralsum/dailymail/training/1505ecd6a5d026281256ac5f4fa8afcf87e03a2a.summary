@entity1 ethics judge @entity0 caught the governing body by surprise with his vow to make public next month significant parts of the @entity7 report into @entity9 bidding corruption			1
@entity10 had been briefing up to last thursday night that @entity0 ’s november statement would be nothing more than a progress report on his study of @entity7 ’s findings about the flawed 2018 and 2022 votes			1
but @entity0 told @entity1 that the ‘ statement will contain an overview of the investigation report , a summary of the main findings , conclusions and recommendations of the report , as well as a brief evaluation of the same ’			1
@entity0 will reveal key elements of the @entity7 report into @entity9 bidding corruption the differing stances demonstrate at least that @entity0 ’s adjudicatory chamber are acting independently of the @entity1 executive , who have not seen any of the four copies of @entity7 ’s findings			1
it is thought @entity0 will recommend charges are brought against a double - digit number of personnel involved in the bids but not that the @entity9 be taken away from @entity39			1
the full @entity7 report will not be published to protect witness confidentiality and for legal reasons			2
@entity7 , as an @entity44 citizen , did not investigate the @entity46 and @entity47 bids			0
@entity49 coach @entity48 told guests at the @entity51 this week that he and his class of 92 colleagues do n’t particularly like being bracketed with that name			1
but that has n’t stopped them exploiting it commercially for all its worth			0
@entity49 coach @entity48 ( centre ) does not like to be bracketed as being part of the ' class of 92 ' emirates , the only one of @entity1 ’s six top - tier sponsors not to comment on the need for an inquiry after the allegations around corrupt @entity9 bidding , are said to be wavering on whether to continue their backing in @entity46 in 2018			1
the @entity72 - based airline are believed to have worries about @entity1 ’s battered image			2
sources say @entity1 ’s finance committee are aware of @entity78 ’ concerns			0
an @entity78 spokesperson said : ‘ we do not comment on rumours or speculation			0
’ @entity83 performance chief @entity82 produced his 2003 @entity86 winner ’s medal to show the @entity83 board before beginning his recent presentation about the way forward for the @entity91 team			0
however , the directors should n’t have been too impressed with the backroom staff gong because even the media man received one in @entity96 before famously doing a jig on the podium			0
@entity82 ’s plan is to bring in an array of world - class sports scientists to produce key marginal gains			2
@entity83 chairman @entity104 told council this was ‘ not the cheapest option ’			0
@entity83 performance chief @entity82 is hoping to have a positive effect on the @entity91 national football team the shambles of the @entity83 not having a single representative from their doomed international committee in @entity113 for the @entity91 under 21 match , revealed by @entity115 , was raised in last week ’s council meeting and described as a ‘ disgrace ’ by respected councillor @entity118 among others			0
the less - than - helpful reply to @entity118 from @entity121 , who now has overall command of the marginalised @entity123 in his role as chairman of the @entity126 , was : ‘ we ca n’t have the agenda of the @entity83 being dictated by @entity129			2
’ @entity130 was also responsible for the bizarre decision to make @entity132 , a vice-president of @entity133 , a @entity135 representative on the @entity123 after he was kicked off by the @entity136			0
the @entity135 and @entity137 remain flummoxed by @entity130 ’s decision but getting a first - hand explanation is difficult because @entity130 usually only deigns to talk to the press when he has an election to win			0
former @entity49 chief executive @entity121 made a ' bizarre decision ' in making @entity132 a @entity135 representative on the @entity123 @entity132 , pictured on the far right sitting alongside @entity146 , is vice-president of @entity133 @entity147 , the investment banker chosen as the new @entity149 chief executive , has been such a low - key member of @entity150 in @entity151 that a number of long - time regulars profess never to have seen him			1
the @entity1 ethics commission ’s ludicrous fuss over the return of the £ 16,400 @entity157 watches gifted by @entity159 ’s football federation to @entity9 delegates is put in perspective by @entity49 ’s @entity162 , now on loan at @entity164			1
he sold his personalised @entity49 sponsors @entity165 23 watch to a @entity168 dealer , who is now asking £ 17,500 for it .			2

@entity0 will release statement that will ' contain an overview of the investigation report ' into the @entity9 bidding *process*
it is thought @entity0 will recommend charges are brought against a double - digit number of personnel
@entity49 coach @entity48 does not like the ' class of 92 ' *tag*
