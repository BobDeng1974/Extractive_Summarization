my outfit had been chosen carefully — a beautiful deep pink and purple top and smart black trousers			2
never had i been so excited about attending a party			2
all my friends would be there , my ‘ gang ’ of the past eight years			1
we had so much news to share			1
after months away , i hoped they ’d be as excited to see me , as i was to see them			2
i was just putting on my make - up , when a cursory glance at my email stopped me in my tracks			1
it said : ‘ if you come tonight , we will leave			2
’ the message was from a woman i ’d been friends with for years			1
prejudice : @entity23 feels let down by friends who were hostile towards her when she returned from weeks nursing @entity27 victims in @entity28 ‘ not everyone accepts that you ’re not a risk and we think it ’s best if you do n’t return to the group for another two months			1
’ the hostility was like a slap in the face , and tears soon followed			2
i cancelled my plans and the blouse was consigned to the back of my wardrobe			2
what had i done to deserve this cruel treatment from the people i loved dearly ? the truth will shock you : i am a nurse with the international relief group , @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , and had just returned from @entity49 , capital of @entity28 in @entity50 , where i ’d spent weeks nursing @entity27 victims			1
on duty : mary in protective gear if dealing with the daily horror of this terrible disease was n’t difficult enough , the ignorance , prejudice and paranoia of people back home — the very people whose generosity these sufferers are dependent on — has stunned me			1
i just hope it does n’t deter other volunteers from going out to help			0
i ’d been extremely careful since my return three weeks ago			0
although my chances of developing the virus were minuscule due to @entity48 ’s meticulous hygiene procedures , i did n’t want to worry people			1
so i stayed at home until the incubation period passed and i had a certificate of all - clear from @entity74			1
it just so happened that my ‘ release date ’ coincided with the party — a party i ’d now been effectively barred from			0
i ’d grown used to some of my friends and family thinking i was mad for working in such terrible conditions when , as a trained nurse and midwife , i could just get a job in a local hospital			1
i ’d started going on aid missions in 1998			0
i did n’t want accolades , i just wanted to do my bit and as a single woman with few obligations , i felt i should			0
during the past 16 years i ’ve been to some of the world ’s most difficult areas : @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and most recently , @entity28			1
i ’ve survived warzones , had a gun held to my head , almost died from typhoid , contracted malaria and witnessed unspeakable suffering			0
yet i ’d never felt as hurt as i did in that moment			0
in @entity49 , i ’d spent six weeks in the largest @entity27 centre the world has seen			1
while i was away i was unaware of the fear that had disseminated across the @entity107 , leaving people panicking that @entity107 , too , was about to be gripped by an @entity27 outbreak			1
it does n’t matter how often you reassure people , those images of sick and dying children remain fixed in their minds			0
some of my @entity48 colleagues have reported the same reaction from their communities			0
one doctor , who ’d previously been praised for going on aid missions , returned from @entity50 to find he was now viewed as a threat			1
during the past 16 years @entity23 has been to some of the world ’s most difficult areas : @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and most recently , @entity28 and a recent news story revealed how a healthy nine - year - old boy , who had recently been in @entity125 with his aid - worker mother , was banned from attending a school in @entity128 amid parents ’ fears about their children catching ebola , despite the fact he ’d been screened by the @entity134			1
the fears are completely unfounded			1
infection control measures with @entity48 were paramount			0
touching infected patients was forbidden and we were instructed to keep at least two metres apart from staff , patients and visitors			0
it went against all my instincts			0
as a nurse , i wanted to reach out to people , to comfort them , especially women in the throes of labour as well as ebola , but i knew i could n’t risk breaching the strict rules in place			1
@entity23 worked 12 - hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing with her friends when she returned yet among the many harrowing scenes there were positive moments			1
one young man called @entity157 was carried , critically ill , into the tent where i was working			0
his eyes had the awful ‘ ebola look ’ i came to recognise — extreme fatigue combined with primal fear			0
yet a few weeks later , he walked out proudly clutching his survivor ’s recovery certificate			1
unfortunately , survivors often faced onward battles			0
many were driven home to their villages in an @entity48 car , only to be treated as outcasts			1
i had no idea i was about to get a taste of this myself			0
i ’d worked 12 - hour days with only three days off and was looking forward to relaxing over a few lattes and catching up on news and much needed hugs			1
if only ! shortly before departure , i received my first inkling of the stigma to come			0
an email from my two lodgers at my home near @entity183 in @entity184 , informed me they would be moving out for three weeks			2
it was nothing personal , they said , they ’d been instructed by their workplace to avoid me			0
i knew the fears were unfounded , as ebola is spread only by the bodily fluids of an infected person , but i respected their decision			1
official guidelines from @entity74 said isolation was n’t necessary , but i wanted to prove i was n’t a threat			0
i took my temperature twice a day and a close friend agreed to be on standby to drive me to an isolation unit , in the highly unlikely event of me becoming unwell			0
shortly into my self - imposed quarantine , i spoke to a doctor friend on the phone			2
‘ who ’s taking your temperature ? ’ he questioned			2
‘ i ’m taking it myself , ’ i replied			0
‘ well , you could easily fudge that ! ’ he retorted			0
why would anyone think i ’d deliberately put anyone ’s life at risk by falsifying my temperature readings			2
i explained i had to be symptomatic to be contagious , but he saw no need to apologise			0
@entity23 knew her friends ' fears were unfounded , as ebola is spread only by the bodily fluids of an infected person his comments really stung			1
i could n’t believe it — especially from a medical professional			0
another aid worker i know was told she could n’t pick up her grandchildren from school			0
i have n’t returned to the group who excluded me from the party , because while the majority are happy to accept me , some have made it clear they would still walk out			2
i just wish they ’d pick up the phone instead of hiding behind an email			0
because the only way to combat ignorance and panic is through true scientific facts			0
her experience has given @entity23 an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors who are shunned by their own communities unexpectedly , all this has given me an insight into the plight of many ebola survivors			1
my suffering is nothing compared to theirs , but i can now identify in a small way with their rejection			0
i ’m planning to return to @entity28 this month and i ’ll feel honoured to share their experiences			1
@entity48 have provided amazing emotional support and i have some loyal friends , too			2
@entity28 survivors are n’t nearly so fortunate			1
i wo n’t let people ’s ignorance stop me , but next time i come home i wo n’t be crushed by their attitudes			1
this experience has flushed out my true friends from those who just pay lip service .			2

@entity275 *'s* friends were hostile when she returned from @entity28
for past 16 years @entity23 has been to some of the world ’s most difficult areas
*including* @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and most recently , @entity28
she worked 12 - hour days with only three days off nursing @entity27 victims
@entity23 could *n't* wait to get home to her friends and share her experiences
what was more frustrating was that she knew their fears were unfounded
