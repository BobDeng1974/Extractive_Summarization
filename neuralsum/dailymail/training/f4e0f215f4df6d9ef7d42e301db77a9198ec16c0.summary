in october 2004 skeletal remains found on the island of @entity2 in @entity3 hinted at a previously unknown species of human that existed 15,000 years ago			1
called homo floresiensis , the species was dubbed a ‘ hobbit ’ as it was smaller than any other known species of human			2
but reanalysis has revealed that it may not be a new species at all , but rather a human that has features consistent with someone with @entity18 's syndrome			1
@entity19 of bones found in @entity3 suggests they are not from a ' hobbit '			1
scientists say the finding on @entity2 can be attributed to @entity18 's syndrome			1
this image compares the skull of the ' hobbit ' @entity26 ( left ) to that of @entity29 , another skull from @entity2 , dated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 years ago the latest findings , reported in the @entity33 , was conducted by an international team of researchers			1
they suggest that the single specimen on which the new designation depends , known as @entity26 after the cave it was discovered in - @entity41 - does not represent a new species			2
indeed , aside from @entity26 , no substantial new bone discoveries have been made in the cave since this finding			2
‘ the skeletal sample from @entity41 cave contains fragmentary remains of several individuals , ’ said dr @entity46 , professor of developmental genetics and evolution at @entity49			0
‘ @entity26 has the only skull and thigh bones in the entire sample			2
’ the first indicator that the finding could be explained by @entity18 's syndrome was craniofacial asymmetry , a left - right mismatch of the skull that is characteristic of the disorder			1
the 15,000 - year - old skeleton , officially known as @entity26 , got its nickname from its squat stature			2
the 3 - foot ( 1 - metre ) tall , 30 - year - old female was based on remains that were uncovered in the @entity41 cave on the remote @entity3 island of @entity2 in 2003			2
since the discovery , scientists debated whether the specimen actually represents an extinct species in the human family tree , perhaps a diminutive offshoot of @entity76 , a 1.8 - million - year - old hominid and the first to have body proportions comparable to those of modern @entity80			0
the researchers noted this asymmetry in @entity26 as early as 2006 , but it had not been reported by the excavating team and was later dismissed as a result of the skull 's being long buried , he said			2
initial descriptions of @entity26 focused on @entity26 's unusual anatomical characteristics : a cranial volume reported as only 380 milliliters ( 23.2 cubic inches ) , suggesting a brain less than one third the size of an average modern human			2
the skeleton also had short thigh bones , which were used to reconstruct a creature standing only 3.5 feet ( 1.06 metres ) tall			0
although @entity26 lived only 15,000 years ago , comparisons were made to earlier hominins , including @entity76 and @entity98			1
other traits were characterised as unique and therefore indicative of a new species			0
but a thorough re-examination of the available evidence in the context of clinical studies , the researchers said , suggests a different explanation			0
in the first place , they write , the original figures for cranial volume and stature are underestimates , ‘ markedly lower than any later attempts to confirm them			0
’ the researchers have consistently found a cranial volume of about 430 milliliters ( 26.2 cubic inches )			0
' the difference is significant , and the revised figure falls in the range predicted for a modern human with @entity18 's syndrome from the same geographic region , ' dr @entity46 said			1
the latest findings , reported in the @entity33 , was conducted by an international team of researchers			0
they suggest that the single specimen on which the new designation depends , known as @entity26 after the cave it was discovered in - @entity129 - is not a new species @entity26 is shown in three different views to illustrate facial asymmetry			0
a is the actual specimen , @entity133 is the right side doubled at the midline and mirrored , and @entity137 is the left side doubled and mirrored			0
differences in left and right side facial architectures are apparent , and illustrate growth abnormalities of @entity26 the original estimate of 3.5 feet ( 1.06 metres ) for the creature 's height was based on extrapolation combining the short thigh bone with a formula derived from an @entity149 pygmy population			0
but humans with @entity18 's syndrome also have diagnostically short thigh bones , dr @entity46 said			1
though these and other features are unusual , he acknowledged , ' unusual does not equal unique			0
' the originally reported traits are not so rare as to have required the invention of a new hominin species			0
' instead , the researchers build the case for an alternative diagnosis : that of @entity18 's syndrome , one of the most commonly occurring developmental disorders in modern humans			1
' when we first saw these bones , several of us immediately spotted a developmental disturbance , ' said @entity46 , ' but we did not assign a specific diagnosis because the bones were so fragmentary			0
' over the years , several lines of evidence have converged on @entity18 's syndrome			1
' this reconstruction of what @entity26 was once thought to look like was created by researchers in @entity174 at the @entity175 in 2012			0
using the skill fragments found in @entity2 , they added muscle and skin to reveal her face , but the assumption she was a new species of human may now not be true here dr @entity185 ( right ) looks at a replica of @entity26 floresienses with @entity187 from the university of @entity190 's @entity189 and environmental sciences back in 2012			1
the new research , however , claims the bones have all the markings of an ancient human that suffered from @entity18 's syndrome a previously unpublished measurement of @entity26 's occipital - frontal circumference - the circumference of the skull taken roughly above the tops of the ears - allowed the researchers to compare @entity26 to clinical data routinely collected on patients with developmental disorders			1
here too , the brain size they estimate is within the range expected for an @entity211 human with @entity18 's syndrome			1
@entity26 's short thigh bones not only match the height reduction seen in @entity18 's syndrome , dr @entity46 said , but when corrected statistically for normal growth , they would yield a stature of about 1.26 meters , or just over four feet , a figure matched by some humans now living on @entity2 and in surrounding regions			1
these and other @entity18 - like characteristics , the researchers state , are present only in @entity26 , and not in the other @entity41 skeletal remains , further evidence of @entity26 's abnormality			1
' this work is not presented in the form of a fanciful story , but to test a hypothesis : are the skeletons from @entity41 cave sufficiently unusual to require invention of a new human species ? ' dr @entity46 said			0
' our reanalysis shows that they are not			0
the less strained explanation is a developmental disorder			0
' here the signs point rather clearly to @entity18 's syndrome , which occurs in more than one per thousand human births around the world			1

@entity19 of bones found in @entity3 suggests they are not from a ' hobbit '
scientists say finding on @entity2 can be attributed to @entity18 's syndrome
this *counteracts* previous claims that the bones belonged to a previously unknown species of human 15,000 years ago
researchers say the initial findings were *flawed* in their analysis of ' @entity26 '
instead they claim the bones have all the markings of an ancient human that suffered from the disorder and is not a new species
