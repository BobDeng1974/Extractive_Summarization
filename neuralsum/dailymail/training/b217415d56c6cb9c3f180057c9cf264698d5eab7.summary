@entity0 was a rock in the @entity3 team i was privileged to coach and was always one of the first names on the team sheet			1
i dropped him just once — that was for the 2003 @entity9 semi-final which was totally a tactical call because i particularly wanted two ball players in midfield against the @entity14 , so i brought in @entity15			1
come the final against @entity17 , @entity0 was straight back in alongside @entity18 because , among other things , i wanted him to sort out @entity20 , which he did in style			0
@entity0 was totally supportive of the team and unquestioning of my difficult call , despite the disappointment			0
he remained just as energetic and committed in training and as vocal in the changing room , in fact more so			0
he was the complete model professional			0
@entity0 came into the @entity3 team when we started to rebuild after the 1999 @entity9 , and his partnership alongside @entity51 served us magnificently well			1
he was sometimes under - rated but not by me or any of the @entity3 guys who played alongside @entity54			1
he was very strong , ran a nice outside curve , had a big clearing kick , was hugely brave in the tackle and contact area and had a much better passing game than he was given credit for			1
for a few years , @entity0 was as good as any centre in the world , right up there with @entity64			2
take a look at the recording of @entity3 ’s 2003 @entity68 decider against @entity69 at @entity70 and watch their battle carefully			1
much to learn : sir @entity73 says @entity74 ( centre ) is not yet in the class of @entity23 setting the standard : but @entity23 in his pomp was as good as @entity79 ( centre ) @entity23 , in his pomp , would walk into the current @entity3 team in that problem outside centre spot			1
i rate him above @entity74 although @entity74 is still fairly young and has the potential to take his game to another level yet			2
the ultimate team man , @entity0 was always at the heart and soul of the group			0
at meetings he was generally fairly quiet and attentive , but as the game approached he would always start to energise proceedings and he was a strong , confident voice in the dressing room			2
he was hugely respected by his peers			0
when @entity0 was called before the @entity98 after the @entity99 , i had no hesitation in appearing as a character witness for him at the hearing at @entity103			0
i was very proud to do so			0
i believe what happened in @entity105 was blown out of proportion , and i thought it important that somebody reiterated his complete devotion to @entity3 over a long career			1
watching on : @entity23 was assistant coach for the @entity111 against @entity3 earlier this year new hobby : @entity23 poses for pictures during his celebrity golf classic in @entity115 earlier this year early days : @entity23 goes over for @entity116 as they beat @entity117 36 - 12 at @entity118 in 2000 @entity0 will make an exceptional coach and i ’m encouraged to hear he might be looking in that direction			1
he listens , absorbs and learns , and those are great traits when you match them with his love of the game and instinctive understanding of what makes players tick			2
he ’s the last of the 2003 squad to hang up his boots but i do n’t lament that passing of time			2
we all sort of drew a line in the sand at @entity3 ’s 10 - year reunion last november , which was a great occasion but i suspect possibly the last time we will ever all get back together in the same room for a function			1
everybody is out there now living their new , busy , ‘ different ’ lives , heading off in different directions , which is how it should be			0
everybody becomes an ex-player eventually .			0
