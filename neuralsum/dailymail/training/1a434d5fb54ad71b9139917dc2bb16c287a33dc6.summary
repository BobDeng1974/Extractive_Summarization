by @entity0 you may think that microwaves are only used to cook speedy readymeals or defrost food at the last minute			2
but one @entity6 company has developed a version of the device that enables it to calculate the number of calories in a meal			1
a prototype device by @entity14 uses microwaves , which travel through food , to measure the fat and water content of dinner and consequently , its calorific content			1
a conceptual image of the as yet unnamed gadget is pictured with obesity rates rising , there is huge demand for kitchen gadgets that make counting calories easier			2
and while cutting - edge kitchen scales go some way to helping , @entity6 firm @entity14 believes there is an easier way			2
its unnamed calorie counter , developed in a laboratory in @entity40 , @entity41 , can accurately reveal the calorific content of a plate of food at the push of a button – without ingredients or components of a meal having to be analysed separately			1
the device emits microwaves and detects specific signatures of the food , based upon how the waves travel though it when they encounter fat and water molecules			1
a concept is pictured the device emits microwaves and detects specific signatures of the food , based upon how the waves travel though it when they encounter fat and water molecules			1
it does not emit enough waves to cook the food , however			0
‘ you can do this because water and fat interact with microwaves very differently , ’ @entity66 , the device ’s creator , told @entity68			1
the prototype can estimate the calories in a meal using a unique equation that the team has developed over three years			1
‘ the equation takes the fat , water content numbers and assumes values for the rest , ’ he said			1
mr @entity66 explained that the machine does n’t need to know the combination of proteins , carbohydrates and sugars as the equation takes care of it , although did not reveal how			0
the machine is currently a prototype and looks like a piece of lab equipment			0
having tested it between 40 and 50 times , the scientists said that it is consistently within five to 10 per cent of the calories count , as determined by chemists using traditional methods			0
the team hopes to transform the prototype into a dome - shaped consumer device , that will fit neatly over a plate of food			1
there is currently no indication of when it might be available or how much it will cost			0
if you ca n’t wait for @entity14 's wonder device , there are a number of smart scales that are on sale that claim to be able to count calories in homemade meals			1
the @entity116 scales weighs food in calories and nutrients – as well as in grams and ounces – so you will be able to make a sandwich and know just how good it is for you instantly			0
the battery - powered weighing scales has a @entity127 chip inside it that talks to an @entity129			0
a piece of fruit , for example , can be placed on the @entity116 scales to show its nutritional information using the accompanying app. together with an app , the scale shows a food 's calories , sugars , vitamins and fat content			2
the app comprises four main screens one of which shows different categories of food that people can pick from when weighing an item			0
to tell the app what food is on the real scales , users can drag its icon onto the @entity116 on the @entity129 ’s screen			0
the nutritional content and calories in a food is displayed on the screen and foods can be added to favourites so that it is easier to find next time			2
the ' current plate ' screen is used to track a whole meal and will show people the total nutritional content of everything that is being cooked or added to a plate			2
to ‘ build ’ a meal , users will simply weigh each ingredient , zeroing the scales before adding another and choosing the relevant food on the app , so that they will get the big nutritional picture of what they are eating			0
the inventors have raised all the moment they need on @entity181 to put the £ 70 ( $ 126 ) scales into production , which will be shipped in november .			0

@entity14 is working on making a consumer calorie counting device
the prototype , developed in @entity40 , @entity41 , uses microwaves , which travel through food to measure the fat and water content of a meal
it uses a unique equation to calculate the number of calories in dinner
the device is *planned* to fit neatly over a plate of food in the future
