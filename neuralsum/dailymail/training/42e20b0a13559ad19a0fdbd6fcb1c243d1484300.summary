by @entity1 reporter published : 06:28 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 22 june 2012 @entity3 jets and @entity5 attack helicopters set the skies alight today as the two nations conducted spectacular live fire drills which were the biggest since the @entity9			1
the ' war games ' and huge explosions south of the @entity3 border today came amid escalating tensions between @entity15 's north and south countries , and included a ' provocative ' gesture where a @entity15 flag was used as a target			1
the drill at @entity21 , near the heavily - armed @entity15 border , involved 2,000 troops along with jet fighters , tanks , @entity26 attack helicopters , @entity28 ' tank - killer ' aircraft , missiles and multiple rocket launchers			1
fire power : a @entity3 @entity33 tank unloads live rounds at the @entity35 during the ' war games ' drills today explosions in the sky : the live fire exercise could be seen as provocative towards @entity15 amid escalating tensions taking aim : an @entity26 helicopter flies near the @entity15 flag as part of an exercise , while , right , @entity3 special forces deploy by parachute the exercises were intended to mark this week 's 62nd anniversary of the start of the @entity9 in 1950 , which ended in a truce , leaving the @entity54 still technically at war			1
military allies @entity57 , @entity3 , and the @entity5 are set begin a three - day naval exercise in the @entity59 this weekend , which could further raise tensions around @entity15			1
todays drills , involving 2,000 troops from the @entity5 and @entity3 , are intended to send a clear warning against @entity15 aggression by showing @entity5 and @entity3 combat readiness , @entity3 's @entity61 said in a statement			1
firing line : a @entity70 e- 737 @entity72 aircraft flies flare shells as part of the one - day military tests take cover : @entity3 tanks were just part of the explosive demonstrations near the @entity15 border today biggest ever : the drills , which involved 2,000 , were said by officials to be the largest joint exercise of their kind since the @entity9 opening fire : the drills on the @entity15 border involved jet fighters , tanks , @entity26 attack helicopters , @entity28 ' tank - killer ' aircraft , missiles and multiple rocket launchers			1
ready and waiting : combat equipment is lined up at a training center in @entity96 , north of @entity97 , as @entity3 forces prepare for the exercises officials have described these as the biggest ever joint drills			0
they coincide with several days of joint naval exercises involving a nuclear - powered @entity5 supercarrier and separate @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity57 naval rescue drills			2
a @entity5 military spokeswoman , @entity105 , would n't comment on the flag , deferring to the @entity3 military			0
military precision : @entity110 fighers take part in a live - fire exercise which was held to mark the 62nd anniversary of the start of the @entity9 in 1950 live - fire drills by the allies are fairly routine , but using the @entity15 's national flag as part of target practice is unusual - and will be seen as a provocation by @entity121 , which has previously threatened war for what it called @entity3 insults to the country 's national symbols and leadership			1
still , an immediate @entity15 military retaliation is unlikely			0
the rockets did n't hit the flag , which an analyst said might lead to a less angry @entity15 response			1
but even a direct attack on the flag would probably only result in escalated @entity15 threats because @entity121 's struggling economy prevents it from staging any attack that could cause a war , said @entity140 , a @entity15 professor at @entity97 's @entity141			2
a @entity3 defense official , who declined to be named because of office policy , said the flag was meant to mark enemy territory during the drills , but he would n't comment on @entity121 's possible reaction to use of the @entity15 flag in the drills			1
@entity15 's state media have condemned the ongoing drills as a precursor to an invasion , with the @entity155 warning that even a small clash could lead to a ' full - scale regional nuclear war			2
' tension has been rising since a @entity15 rocket launch in april that @entity97 and @entity160 called a cover for a test of banned long - range missile technology			0
@entity15 said the launch , which happened during celebrations of the centennial of late national founder @entity168 's birth , was meant to send a satellite into orbit ; the rocket broke apart shortly after liftoff			0
the @entity173 condemned the launch , and @entity121 has since made a series of threats against @entity97 's conservative government and media , vowing to attack unless it got an apology for perceived insults against the country and its new , young leader , @entity183			0
thousands of civilians and officials - including @entity3 's prime minister - watched friday 's drills			0
the @entity5 , which has 28,500 troops stationed in @entity3 as a deterrent against @entity15 , deployed @entity26 helicopters , @entity191 and armored vehicles for the drills , @entity97 's @entity61 said in a statement			1
@entity183 took power as supreme leader of @entity15 and its 1.2 million troops after his father , longtime ruler @entity198 , died in december			2
@entity15 has condemned what it calls @entity97 's insensitivity to @entity198 's death and @entity3 media criticism of important national events in the @entity15			0
in recent months , @entity15 has ramped up harsh rhetoric against @entity3 president @entity205 , who ended @entity97 's no - strings - attached aid to @entity121 after he took office in 2008 , with posters and slogans that repeatedly call @entity205 a ' rat			0
' all guns blazing : @entity3 and @entity5 tanks ' advance on an enemy stronghold ' while removing land mines during the joint military drills @entity15 has also ' drastically ' increased fighter jet drills near the border with @entity3 in the first half of this year , a @entity218 official said , declining to be named because of office rules			2
the official would n't provide further details			0
on thursday , the navies of the @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity57 began two - day annual search and rescue exercises near the southern @entity3 island of @entity227			0
