by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 09:01 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:37 est , 23 december 2013 @entity4 had been told that they would have to sign up for health insurance through the ever - breaking healthcare.gov site by the end of monday night but now it has been revealed that the deadline has been covertly pushed back one more day to try to give more people a chance			1
two anonymous officials announced that the 11.59pm deadline that had been set for tonight was pushed back to tuesday - @entity14 - over the weekend , according to the @entity15			1
the @entity16 has insisted that it is doing all it can to make sure people who miss the deadline can still get coverage under a series of exemptions , and apparently this date bait - and - switch is another way of trying to help			2
there will also be a ' good faith exception ' for others , according to a senior @entity26 administration official			2
' we 'll have a special enrollment period , ' the official said last week , for ' all those who make a good faith effort to get enrolled by the deadline ' but fail to do so			0
the official did not say how the government would determine whether or not the effort was made in good faith			0
not working : many last - minute users noted that the website continued to crash on monday as they tried to sign up on the final day - not knowing the deadline had been pushed back secretly over the weekend still others may simply get a break from insurance companies , which the administration has urged to be flexible with people who miss the deadline			1
such is the uncertain state of ' @entity42 ' as it approaches what was originally supposed to be a defining moment - a signup deadline that would provide the first real test of the viability of the healthcare program brought into law by the @entity42			0
adding to the confusion is the fact that the original deadline for obtaining medical coverage was december 15			1
that was extended to december 23 after the federal government 's website , @entity44 , proved dysfunctional and sometimes non-functional			1
problems : health secretary @entity84 is seen here during a photo op when the troubled website did n't work when it was meant to the administration has reserved the right to change the deadline again ' should exceptional circumstances pose barriers to consumers ' enrolling on or before monday			1
@entity26 said on friday that one million people had enrolled for new insurance plans under the law through @entity44 , which serves 36 states , and 14 state - run marketplaces			1
many more enrollments are a major priority for @entity26 's signature healthcare reform , which officials are still hoping will help millions of uninsured and under - insured @entity4 finally to obtain medical coverage by the end of march			0
it is not known how many consumers may have no insurance coverage during periods of 2014 because they failed to sign up on @entity44 by monday			1
some of the 14 states running their own healthcare exchanges have extended their sign - up deadlines past december 23			1
on thursday , the administration announced that if people 's old insurance plans were canceled because of new standards under the law , they can claim a ' hardship ' exemption to the requirement that all @entity4 must have coverage by march 31 or face penalties that start at $ 95 so some of these people may not sign up			2
the @entity26 administration says it is trying to be flexible , but some @entity126 critics of the law say the frequent delays and changes have muddied the waters and confused people			2
trying everything : president and mrs @entity134 met with a group of mothers last week in an effort to persuade them to have their children sign up for the healthcare insurance ' with no clarity as to when people should sign up and who they should pay and when , it 's a virtual certainty that many consumers will find themselves uncovered for a period of time through no fault of their own , ' senator @entity141 , a @entity142 @entity126 , said last week			1
administration officials said on friday there are fewer than 500,000 people who have received cancellation notices from their insurance companies and have not yet found alternatives			0
some were ' auto - enrolled ' in other plans by their insurance companies , the officials said			0
the pace of sign - ups has picked up since october and november when technical problems crippled the @entity44 website			2
anyone who tried the website in october and november and became stuck has been getting attention from the administration			0
officials sent more than two million emails to people who could not advance through the website			0
they have also made more than 600,000 phone calls to consumers and mailed notices to hundreds of thousands of people , officials said			0
' we are confident that we are doing everything we can so that individuals know what their options are to get coverage , whether it is at the marketplace or seeking it through the private insurers , ' said the senior official .			0

monday december 23 was the original deadline for signing up for health insurance but now that has been pushed back to tuesday night
exemptions have been made for people who tried signing up but could not , and those whose existing insurance was taken away
*unclear* how many have signed up
many who tried signing up today were met with a *stalled* website as @entity44 continued to crash
president @entity26 is expected to *symbolically* ' sign up ' for insurance on the website today even though he is already covered through the *military*
