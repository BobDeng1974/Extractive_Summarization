with its matted hair and bald patches it resembles a much - loved toy somewhat past her prime			0
in fact this creature is the best - preserved specimen of a woolly mammoth ever found – whose prehistoric prime was 39,000 years ago			1
even clumps of the animal ’s distinguishing hair are remarkably intact after being trapped in glacial ice until she was discovered in @entity17 earlier this year			2
a 39,000 - year - old female woolly mammoth , which was found frozen in @entity17 in may , is seen here upon its arrival at an exhibition hall in @entity24 , south of @entity25			1
the mammoth will be on display for tourists and visitors from 13 july until 16 september the mammoth , pictured , was discovered in an ice tomb in the @entity32 , or @entity33 earlier this year			1
parts of the carcass are especially well preserved because they remained entirely frozen for thousands of years last year a controversial @entity37 billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real - life @entity39			2
mining magnate @entity41 , who has already embarked on a project to rebuild the @entity44 , was rumoured to be working with the team who created @entity47 the sheep			0
but the research has shown the dinosaurs may have to stay on the big screen - as their dna is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction			0
however , @entity55 scientists are hoping that the samples found on the @entity17 woolly mammoth are n't too old			1
they plan to take the dna samples and reassemble them into a full genome			0
this could then be injected into embryonic cells which have had their own dna taken out , and a suitable living surrogate would be found			2
she is now to go on public display in @entity24 , @entity66			2
but while the public can get a remarkable glimpse of our planet ’s past , scientists will be continuing tests that could give the extinct species a future			2
experts who found the female mammoth in may also discovered a sample of its blood inside ice beneath the carcass – which scientists claim may be used to regrow one of the animals , which last walked the earth around 4,000 years ago			1
preserved muscle tissue was also found from the creature , which was aged between 50 and 60 when she died , according to the @entity92 team who made the discovery on islands off the northern coast of @entity17			1
@entity97 , from the @entity98 in @entity17 , said : ‘ we were really surprised to find mammoth blood and muscle tissue			1
’ he hailed it as ‘ the best - preserved mammoth in the history of paleontology ’			0
a worker at the exhibition hall in @entity24 , south of @entity25 , inspects the snout of the 39,000 - year - old woolly mammoth			1
scientists discovered a well - preserved sample of blood from the creature in may and are looking into ways in which the extinct species could be brought back from extinction the snout of the 39,000 - year - old mammoth , pictured , on display in @entity25			1
when the mammoth was discovered preserved muscle tissue was also found from the creature , aged between 50 and 60 when she died , according to the @entity92 team who made the discovery on islands off the northern coast of @entity17 the foot of the female woolly mammoth , pictured , shows that many of the animal 's original features - including the hair that gave the mammoth its woolly name - is still intact			1
the upper torso and two legs , which were found in the soil and not buried in ice , were gnawed by predators and almost did n't survive parts of the carcass are especially well preserved because they remained entirely frozen for thousands of years – including the hair			1
however , the upper torso and two legs , which were entombed in the soil , have been gnawed by prehistoric and modern predators and almost did not survive			0
it is the first ever well - preserved sample of blood from a woolly mammoth and has reopened the debate over the morality of @entity39 - style projects to restore extinct creatures to the planet the blood and other samples have been made available to @entity55 scientist @entity156 ’s private bioengineering laboratory			1
the laboratory has confirmed it is working with other mammoth dna samples in a bid to return the extinct @entity17 mammoth			2
the eventual plan is to plant an implanted egg into a live elephant for a 22 - month pregnancy			0
the hope is that at least one living cell of the mammoth was preserved ‘ although even with such well - preserved remains , this may not be the case ’			0
earlier this year a group of scientists from around the world met for the @entity174 conference in @entity175 , sponsored by @entity176			0
the group were discussing the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction , also known as ‘ de-extinction ’			0
the animals included the dodo bird , the @entity183 , last seen in 1904 in @entity184			0
the @entity185 , a plains zebra which once lived in @entity187 but died out in 1883			0
however , some scientists insist it will be impossible to create the same mammoths as once roamed the earth			0
a researcher from the @entity193 of @entity194 at the @entity98 , pictured , working near a carcass of the female mammoth found on a remote island off the coast of @entity17 in may a researcher from the @entity98 in @entity17 holds a test tube with a sample of well - preserved blood found in a carcass of a female woolly mammoth			1
the sample was discovered on a remote island in the @entity207 and is thought to be the first discovery of its kind dr @entity97 initially put the age of the animal at around 10,000 years but more recent dating tests suggest the creature is much older , dating back around 39,000 years			1
‘ it is great luck that the blood preserved and we plan to study it carefully , ’ he said			0
‘ for now our suspicion is that mammoth blood contains a kind of natural anti-freeze			2
’ he suggested that the animal was so well preserved because it did not ‘ defrost and then freeze again ’			0
‘ we suppose the mammoth fell into water or got bogged down in a swamp , could not free herself and died , ’ he added			2
‘ due to this fact the lower part of the body was preserved very well			0
’ as well as a sample of blood , @entity92 scientists also discovered a well - preserved sample of muscle tissue from the woolly mammoth carcass			1
the blood and tissue were preserved because they were buried in an ice tomb on the @entity242 islands for what 's thought to have been 10,000 years the woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the @entity247 , not by overhunting as previously believed			1

female woolly mammoth was found frozen in a @entity17 ice tomb in may
the creature will be on display in @entity25 until september
scientists think she got stuck in a swamp and died over 39,000 years ago
blood sample found at the scene could be used to clone the beast
