@entity0 was in confident mood on the morning of his eagerly - awaited rematch with @entity3 and @entity5 super-middleweight champion @entity4 by sending his opponent a taunting tweet			1
@entity0 tweeted : ' no more sleeps @ @entity8 ' as he continued his provocative lead up to the @entity10			1
many believe the @entity12 overstepped the mark with his trash talking during the weigh - in when he said that @entity4 was ' a man on death row '			1
to which the champion replied : ' i want to send him back into the hole he crawled out of and put this saga behind me '			0
@entity0 ' comments , made in front of 4,000 boisterous fans , have not gone unnoticed by the @entity26			2

no worries : @entity0 looked confident as he weighed in well within the 12st limit at @entity72 inside : @entity4 weighed in just within the limit to ensure the rematch goes ahead on saturday @entity76 the @entity63 said to @entity77 as they posed for the eyeball - to - eyeball photographs : ' you look drawn and dehydrated			1

very nervous , if you ask me			0
' @entity0 responded by saying : ' i did the weight comfortably , we wanted to moan about the 4pm weigh - in for the sake of moaning			2
business time : the trash talk will stop between @entity4 and @entity0 when they go toe - to - toe at @entity68 @entity91 to cheeky : both @entity92 try to show they 're relaxed ahead of the super middleweight world title bout ' i feel perfect in mind , body and soul			1
i could n't be more ready			0
' @entity4 needs reassurance but he ca n't find it and for that reason he 's going to struggle			0
