by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 07:04 est , 6 january 2014 @entity2 proved a smartphone camera can rival some of the features of professional devices when it released its @entity6 , and now the firm has taken a step further by acquiring photography app @entity9			1
reports claim the @entity13 - tech giant bought the popular , high - end photography app over the new year , but the cost of the deal has not yet been announced			0
the 69p app , which has since been removed from the app store , features a professional ‘ burst mode ’ and up to six times zoom			1
reports claim @entity2 has bought the popular , high - end photography app @entity9 for an undisclosed amount			1
the 69p app , which has since been removed from the app store , features a professional ' burst mode ' and up to six times zoom an @entity2 patent filed in november detailed a system capable of capturing low - resolution images that can be refocused even after they ’ve been taken and processed			1
it would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image , similar to the technology seen in @entity38 cameras , meaning the shots appear in @entity40 rather than @entity41			0
according to patent papers , which were originally filed in 2011 , photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots			0
these images would be taken through what ’s called a microlens array			0
according to @entity2 's patent , this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high - resolution photo			0
burst mode lets users take multiple photos in one take and then select the best image			1
it ’s predominantly used in professional photography to capture action shots in sport , for example			2
however , since the likes of @entity67 and @entity2 have introduced the feature in their latest handsets , it is becoming more popular among amateur photographers			0
@entity2 added burst mode to its isight camera with the release of its @entity6 last year			1
it can capture 10 photos per second			0
by comparison , @entity9 ’s burst mode can capture 20 photos per second			1
this is because it captures between 20 and 30 frames per second , and in certain models of phone is said to be capable of up to 60 frames per second			0
@entity9 also captures these images at a full resolution of 8 - megapixels			0
elsewhere , @entity2 ’s @entity6 zoom is only half the capability of @entity9 ’s			1
@entity2 's vice president of worldwide marketing @entity88 , pictured , unveiled the improved @entity91 camera of the @entity6 last year			2
@entity2 added burst mode to this camera , which captures 10 photos per second			1
by comparison , @entity9 's burst mode can capture 20 photos per second @entity9 , pictured , topped the @entity2 's @entity95 list in 16 countries during 2013 @entity67 ’s @entity97 shoots up 20 pictures continuously at full - sensor resolution , but each photo is taken at 0.1333 seconds apart , according to @entity9 , which averages out at 7.5 photos per second			2
by acquiring @entity9 , @entity2 may be looking to add the app ’s super-fast and professional features to future models of its @entity6 and @entity107			1
the acquisition could also improve @entity2 ’s video recording capabilities			0
it added slow - motion video to its @entity6 that records at 120 frames per second and @entity9 could help improve the quality of this , too			2
in a statement , an @entity2 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity2 buys smaller technology companies from time to time , and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans			0
’ @entity9 topped the @entity2 ’s @entity95 list in 16 countries during 2013 and is run by its founder @entity121 .			2

@entity9 adds professional photography features to smartphones
this *includes* ‘ burst mode , ’ that lets users take multiple images in one go
@entity2 added many of @entity9 ’s tools to the camera in its @entity6
firm has now bought the 69p @entity138 app for an undisclosed amount
