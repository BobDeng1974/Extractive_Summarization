my first trip to @entity2 was with my aunt when i was about 18 and i had been appearing in @entity4 for about 12 months			1
i can remember it all so clearly			0
we had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical @entity9 on @entity10 and did lots and lots of shopping			2
we returned to the city that never sleeps in january 2001 , eight months before the terrible events of 9/11 , and one of the first things my boyfriend @entity18 and i did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the @entity21 to see the monument to those who died			1
it was a very poignant moment			0
@entity4 star @entity25 and boyfriend @entity18 take a selfie in @entity2 there were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful			1
@entity18 and i flew to the @entity32 from @entity33 and spent four nights in the city			1
i love flying from @entity33 if i can , not just because it 's nearer to my home but because it 's not so vast and sprawling as either @entity40 or @entity41			0
we stayed at the @entity43 where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants			1
and when we got to the room , we were met by a butler who immediately took away our shoes for shining - very impressive			2
you do n't get that at a @entity54 ! we had a beautiful suite on the 31st floor , giving us panoramic views of @entity58			1
we valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area , and it came in really handy because during our stay @entity18 's cousin in @entity2 celebrated his 30th birthday , so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly			1
we sipped champagne as we gazed out across @entity70 - and @entity71 suddenly felt a very long way away			2
the @entity75 as seen from @entity58 , of which it boasts panoramic views one of @entity25 and @entity18 's first stops was to pay their respects to those lost on september 11 , 2001 on the second night of our break , we went on the @entity83 @entity2 cruise , which offers an unforgettable three - hour trip along the @entity85			1
we enjoyed cocktails and then a great three - course meal , and after that there was music and dancing			1
you can go outside on deck where you have amazing views of @entity70			2
actually we only just made the cruise by the skin of our teeth			2
president @entity98 was in @entity2 to address the @entity99 and as we were in a taxi heading for the pier to board the cruise , we discovered that the police had closed a lot of the streets to let the president 's motorcade through			1
with the clock ticking and our yellow cab going nowhere , we decided to get out and find the nearest subway station			0
once our train reached its destination , we had to dash to get to the cruise boat , but fortunately we just made it on time			2
i 'm so glad we did because to see @entity70 like that was an unforgettable experience			0
the couple , who met as partners on @entity121 , enjoyed a @entity123 @entity122 of the @entity85 the bright lights and busy traffic of @entity126 which @entity127 covered extensively during her four - day trip during our break , we saw most of the famous sights , including the @entity131 , where we took some great pictures			1
we did n't manage to catch a show , though - we simply ran out of time			2
we wanted to have a juicy steak at a proper @entity2 steakhouse			1
friends had told us about a place called @entity139 in @entity140 - it does n't look very special ( in fact , there 's graffiti all over the walls outside ) but it 's reckoned to serve the best burgers in town			1
i have to agree they 're pretty special			0
it was @entity18 's first visit to @entity2 and he absolutely loved it			1
he also enjoyed the shopping			2
we must have covered the whole of @entity126 during our stay , and yes , purchases were made			0
i have to confess i bought a few dresses			0
the pound was very good value against the dollar at the time , so there were a lot of bargains to be had			0
i calculated that many things were half the price compared with the @entity164 - so how could i resist ? while @entity25 shopped at famed @entity2 stores such as @entity166 , @entity18 worked out in the gym for bargain shopping , @entity127 recommends discount outlet store @entity169 for lots of major brands @entity18 was n't always my shopping buddy			1
he chose to remain at the hotel a few times and work out at the gym			0
so while i was at @entity166 's he was on the running machine			0
a crowd of paparazzi turned out to be for @entity179 , but sadly a selfie with the pop star was n't an option despite our world renown as an ice - dancing couple - we met while we were partners on the @entity186 show @entity121 - we managed to resist the lure of the rink at the @entity189			1
for @entity18 , ice skating is too much like work			1
i still skate from time to time and i have to say i 'm a lot better at it than i was on the programme			0
i think that 's because i 'm just doing it for fun now and there 's no pressure on me			0
if anybody is looking for good shopping , i can recommend @entity202 - it 's great for dresses , and their prices are excellent			2
if you 're after big savings , head to @entity169 , which is like an outlet store for lots of major brands			0
friends had told us about it before we travelled to @entity2			2
i 'm glad they did because the prices were so temptingly low			0
and of course i also made sure to visit the @entity217 to get presents for my little girl - we were loaded up with bags from there , much to her delight , when we returned to @entity223			0
perhaps the biggest surprise of the trip was when we had stopped to have lunch at a small @entity228 restaurant on @entity58 near our hotel while we were eating , we noticed a crowd gathering - with lots of paparazzi photographers			1
we were wondering who was going to emerge when out stepped @entity179			0
it was the ultimate holiday treat - it was just a shame i could n't arrange a selfie with her			0
that would have been the icing on the cake			0
@entity240 ( 0843 636 2001 ) offers a three - night holiday to @entity2 from Â£ 899pp			1
this includes accommodation in the @entity75 on a room - only basis and return flights with @entity246 from @entity41			1

while there the @entity121 stars stayed at the @entity75
their suite on the 31st floor offered up panoramic views of @entity58
the couple enjoyed a three - hour @entity83 @entity2 cruise on the @entity85
