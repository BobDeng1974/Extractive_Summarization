the 1958 work , called ‘ @entity11 ’ , worth an estimated £ 50 million before last month ’s attack , will cost £ 200,000 to restore but may still lose millions from its value			1
the irreversible damage to the work of art , which will take up to 18 months to repair , was revealed as 26 - year - old @entity17 was due to be sentenced today			1
@entity17 , who also calls himself @entity18 , calmly signed his name in ink and wrote ' 12 a potential piece of @entity22 ' on the @entity4 canvas in front of horrified art - lovers at the @entity27 gallery			1
however , his sentencing was postponed to allow for the preparation of reports @entity31 heard there may need to be a @entity34 hearing - a trial by judge - to decide whether @entity17 should be sentenced on the basis of repair costs or the devaluation of the painting			1
@entity41 , representing @entity17 who has already pleaded guilty to a single charge of criminal damage , said that an expert had claimed that the value lost could be ' between £ 5 million and £ 9.3 million '			1
@entity8 went into lockdown after the ink pen was used to scribble on the canvas , but by that time @entity17 had already left			2
the former graphic designer and cleaner , who was born in @entity50 but had been living in a squat in @entity52 , west @entity9 , was arrested by police the next day after giving a number of interviews to the media			0
@entity17 , now of @entity57 , @entity58 , originally claimed to have added value to the work , but pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage in excess of £ 5,000 on sunday october 7th when he appeared before magistrates			1
art ? mr @entity2 insists his graffiti is part of a movement called ' @entity22 ' the defaced painting was one of a series , known as the @entity72 murals , gifted to the @entity73 by the artist in 1969 , just before his death			2
the court heard because the painting has never been sold it has no formal value , but experts have estimated it to be around £ 50million			2
restorers will now have to painstakingly strip away the damaged layers , which the pen soaked through right to the back of the canvas , and re-build them in imitation of @entity4 ’s workings , a process which the gallery has confirmed could take 18 months			2
@entity91 , prosecuting , said : ' this is something that will , because of what ’s happened , suffer a reduction in overall value			0
' this is something that simply can not be restored to its original state because it is an original work of art. ' eminent : the defaced painting was one of a series , known as the @entity72 murals , gifted to the @entity73 by the @entity4 , left , in 1969 , just before his death			0
pictured right is the @entity8 , where the attack took place however , mr @entity41 said : ' the court should proceed to sentence the defendant on the remedial costs , the restoration costs , which are set to some £ 200,000 , rather than at the suggested value of reduction			1
@entity17 founded the ‘ @entity118 ’ movement which describes itself as ' not art or anti-art ' , with @entity119			2
after the @entity120 wrote on their website : ' unfortunately @entity73 will not keep the inscription and therefore will ' deface ' something very special			0
' but , regardless of what @entity73 will do with it , @entity4 ’s painting will be always remembered as a potential piece of yellowism			0
' influential : work by @entity4 regularly sells for tens of millions of pounds			0
( @entity131 ) his 1954 homage to @entity132 and ( right ) for @entity133 , from 1957 targeted : the vandalised artwork , right , has been valued at ten million pounds judge @entity135 said it was ' inescapable ' that the reduction in value would have to be taken into account at sentence			0
it will be decided later today whether a @entity34 hearing will take place			0
but judge @entity135 , who will not be carrying out the sentence , said that ' at this stage ' such a hearing was unnecessary			0
he warned @entity17 : ' this is a very serious matter			0
you do face the likelihood of an immediate custodial sentence			1
i do n’t want you to go away with any false hopes			0
' leaving court @entity17 said he did not wish to speak to the press			1
adding : ' i do n’t want to be known in the context of this case where everybody thinks of me as a bad guy			1
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
