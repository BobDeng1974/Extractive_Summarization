by @entity1 reporter published : 08:39 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 30 december 2012 as days of almost relentless downpours blighted parts of the country for much of december , it seems hard to believe that this time last year water reserves were worryingly low due to a lack of rainfall			1
but now figures have emerged showing a tale of two very different years - 2011 was the driest year in @entity12 for 90 years while 2012 was the wettest since records began in 1910			1
last year 's drought across @entity12 forced water companies in the worst - affected areas to start using river water to top up reservoirs			2
from sunshine to rain : while 2011 ( left ) was exceptionally dry , 2012 ( right ) was @entity12 's soggiest year since 1910			1
( @entity22 areas are driest , while blue are wettest ) but exactly a year later strong rain has left communities counting the cost of flooding as rivers burst their banks , struggling to contain the heavy deluge of rain			2
hundreds of alerts have been issued by the @entity32 this month , as several days ' worth of rain has fallen in just a few hours at its worst , contributing to a year of bad weather which has left the @entity37 on the brink of its wettest since records began in 1910			1
homes have been evacuated and weary commuters and travellers have been forced to find alternative routes or abandon their plans altogether as sections of @entity37 's transport network ground to a halt			0
what a difference a year makes : @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , at 12 % of its capacity in 2011 , and the same view ( bottom ) taken this year showing the increasing water level at the reservoir but earlier in the year 2012 looked set to be a year defined by drought			2
in february the dry spell threatened the @entity37 's landscape and in april a hosepipe ban was introduced to conserve vital water , but recent strong rain has left communities counting the cost of flooding			0
now forecasters have said 2012 is set to become the wettest on record in the @entity37 after predicting a wet and windy end to the year as flood - battered areas were warned they face renewed danger from storms			2
according to the @entity75 office just 1.8in ( 46mm ) of rain is needed to fall before december 31 to make this year the wettest on record for the @entity37 overall , with a new record already set for @entity12 with 43.1in ( 1,095.8mm ) falling between january 1 and @entity78			1
warning : low levels in @entity80 in @entity81 last year			0
2011 was the driest year in @entity82 for 90 years and the environment agency has warned that without rain in the near future , @entity12 will experience a severe drought dried up : the @entity87 in @entity88 was reduced to a trickle in december 2011 after months of low rainfall the @entity37 as a whole had 50.8in ( 1,291.2mm ) of rain from january 1 to december 26 , with the wettest year on record for the @entity37 currently 2000 , when 52.6in ( 1,337.3mm ) fell			1
confirmation is expected next week , and would be all the more remarkable considering the drought status declared for parts of the country during the early part of the year			0
in terms of temperature and sunshine the year as a whole is set to be unremarkable , both being around normal			0
however , overall 2012 is set to be cooler than 2011 , but warmer than 2010			0
@entity104 : @entity105 is one of many towns across the @entity37 to suffer serious flooding after torrential rainfall in the last week fresh deluge : a few brave walkers head out out on a wet and windy @entity112 seafront as the south of @entity12 is again lashed with rain strong winds : storms , gale force winds and huge waves batter the promenade and seafront of @entity121 , on the west coast of @entity37 on the last sunday of 2012 but after a year dominated by rain , 2012 could actually end on a dry note			1
although more downpours are predicted today , organisers of @entity127 firework parties have been told they can look forward to a mostly clear evening			0
weathermen say wet conditions could linger in @entity131 and the @entity132 during the day , but should clear by the time revellers venture out			0
however , night - time temperatures will be well down on last year , when southern @entity12 enjoyed a balmy @entity135 ( 50f ) – warmer than @entity136			2
much of northern @entity37 can expect a frost , while the @entity132 will see a noticeable dip to around @entity139 ( 39f )			0
@entity140 : 2012 is already the rainiest year on record for @entity12 , and just 1.8 inches away from being the rainiest ever seen for the whole of the @entity37 , with four days of december to go 1095 2012 1093.3 2000 1070.9 1960 1017.7 1912 1006.6 2002 993.8 1951 992.3 1954 989.9 1927 982.1 2008 965.1 1924			1

driest year in @entity12 and @entity82 for 90 years was in 2011
2012 was the wettest since records began in 1910
