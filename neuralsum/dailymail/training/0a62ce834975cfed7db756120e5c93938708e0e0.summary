the woman who sparked a heated internet discussion after revealing her ' after ' weight loss picture was rejected by @entity3 is set to be featured after all			1
@entity4 , 28 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , appeared on the today show this morning with shape editor - at - large @entity8 , who asserted that the entire incident was a ' misunderstanding ' involving a freelance writer unfamiliar with the magazine 's editorial policies			1
the pair revealed that not only will brooke be featured in an upcoming issue - including the bikini picture in question - but she 'll also join four other women in talking about the true realities of weight loss , and the effects it has on a woman 's body			1
' we are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities			1
we want to turn this into something positive so it makes a big impact			0
' and despite being initially offended by the magazine 's rejection , @entity4 said the miscommunication has been resolved and she is equally excited to be part of this important discussion			2
' it was my intention to start a conversation , ' she said of her photo submission and subsequent blog post about the incident			2
' we want to start a discussion because truly , there is a journey after the weight - loss journey ' ' i had no idea that it would come to this ! it was important to me because that is my body and i felt like i needed to put it out there to show people what a real weight loss looks like			2
' shape initially approached @entity4 about featuring her after her blog came to their attention , but the ' after ' photo she sent in was rejected because of the way her stomach looked			2
the writer handling her story sent her a message that read : ' my editors were hoping you could send over a different after photo ... they are looking to include one with a shirt			1
' perfect solution : ' we are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities			1
we want to turn this into something positive , ' said shape editor - at - large @entity8 ( right ) ' miscommunication ' : ms @entity38 said the writer who asked @entity4 for a picture with a t - shirt instead was a freelancer who ' unfortunately said there was an editorial policy that simply does n't exist ' ' i was hurt , ' @entity4 said on today			1
' i mean , i felt like my body was n't good enough to be on their website when you log on and do see women in bikinis			0
' so she rebutted by refusing to be in the article at all , and by posting a blog entry that went viral			0
' my body is real , not photoshopped or hidden because i feel like i should be ashamed , ' she wrote in her post			0
' this is a body after losing 172lbs , a body that has done amazing things , and looks amazing in a freaking bikini			0
this is the type of body they should have featured because it can give people hope			0
' ms @entity38 said she is excited to give @entity4 - and other woman with the same weight loss experience - a voice			1
before and after : @entity4 responded to @entity3 's initial rejection with a blog post that went viral			0
' this is a body after losing 172lbs , a body that has done amazing things , and looks amazing in a freaking bikini , ' she wrote new woman : in the upcoming @entity3 issue , @entity4 will join four other women in revealing the true realities of weight loss , and the effects it has on a woman 's body ' we want to start a larger discussion about what happens after you lose a significant amount of weight because , truly , there is a journey after the weight - loss journey , ' she said			1
it has not yet been revealed exactly when the issue featuring @entity4 will be published			0
' that is my body and i felt like i needed to put it out there to show people what real weight loss looks like ' in @entity3 's original response to the outrage caused by @entity4 's claims , the magazine insisted it was a miscommunication			1
' this is a result of a misunderstanding with a freelance writer , ' a spokesperson said			0
' this does not represent @entity3 's editorial values and the comments made about @entity3 's " editorial policy " are absolutely untrue			0
' shape prides itself on empowering and celebrating women like @entity4 , and any indication that we would not run the piece with the photo provided was wrong , as we would have been proud to share her inspirational story			2

@entity4 was offended when the writer handling her story asked for an ' after ' photo with a t - shirt , instead of the bikini one she sent in
shape editor - at - large @entity8 called the incident a ' miscommunication ' and said : ' we are excited to make this into an impactful discussion about weight loss and the realities '
