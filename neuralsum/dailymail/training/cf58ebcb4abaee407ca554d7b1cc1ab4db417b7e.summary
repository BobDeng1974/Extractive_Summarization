' on cross-examination , prosecutor @entity148 zeroed in on @entity8 's testimony that he accepted an invitation to meet @entity3 on september 11 because the @entity10 leader was a sheik who deserved respect , and his admission that he was aware bin @entity3 's organization was behind the bombings of @entity24 embassies in @entity159 and @entity160 in 1998 and attack on the @entity162 in 2000			1

@entity44 said it was n't the right time to pursue that request , which was denied by @entity179 on tuesday but was renewed after @entity170 confirmed he would be willing to testify .			0
