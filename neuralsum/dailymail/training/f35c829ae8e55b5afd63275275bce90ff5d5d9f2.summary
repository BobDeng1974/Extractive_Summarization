but she has faced a string of increasingly hostile comments from @entity1 members and supporters , with some claiming she should leave @entity21			1
' @entity25 , the party 's candidate in @entity26 , in @entity27 , added : ' the more @entity2 whinges about tax , the more @entity5 goes up in people 's admiration : squeeze ' em till the pips squeak ! ' miss @entity2 was born in the @entity21 but her father is @entity48 and her mother is from the @entity50			1
former @entity51 footballer mr @entity34 and comedian mr @entity35 have both spoken out against the mansion tax in recent months			1
@entity54 party chairman @entity53 said the reaction showed @entity1 ' really are the nasty party ' and criticised its members for making ' knee - jerk personal attacks '			2
@entity2 was pictured at the @entity60 's @entity59 studios in @entity61 today as the controversy over her attack on @entity5 continued @entity65 leader @entity64 compared the @entity1 attack on @entity2 to @entity68 's comments that @entity70 migrants could be deported from @entity21 mr @entity5 and @entity71 clashed on @entity73 's @entity72 on monday night , when she criticised his controversial proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
but after @entity71 , 36 , won widespread praise for her robust challenge , mr @entity5 , 44 , sought his revenge on @entity80 by joking about her with his 357,000 followers			2
in a reference to @entity9 's 2001 number one single @entity83 , he wrote : ' here 's why our @entity86 needs a mansion tax			1
it 's @entity83 ' , adding a link to a blog post where @entity1 set out the arguments for its mansion tax			1
mr @entity5 was left humiliated on monday night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by @entity71 over @entity1 ’s proposed mansion tax in a reference to the @entity9 song , mr @entity5 said the @entity86 needs a mansion tax ' @entity83 ' @entity99 this morning leapt to mr @entity5 ’s defence and argued that the former pop singer was ‘ wrong ’			1
speaking on his @entity103 phone - in he made light of her suggestion that she would only be able to buy a garage in @entity61 with £ 2m			1
‘ she ’s wrong on that			0
that ’s some garage , he said			0
‘ what we need to do is get rid of the emotion of claiming that one person ’s home is a mansion : why do n’t we treat higher value homes [ fairly ] ? ’ ‘ what is possibly fair about a family who lives in a family home in @entity121 that they pay the same an oligarch ? ’ @entity2 and @entity5 enjoyed a quick drink with the other panel members , @entity126 ( centre ) and sir @entity128 ( right ) , and presenter @entity129 appearing on @entity73 ’s @entity72 , miss @entity2 told him : ‘ you may as well just tax me on this glass of water			1
you ca n’t just point at things and tax them			0
' miss @entity2 , who is thought to be worth around £ 11million , has been accused of opposing the mansion tax only because she is wealthy			1
yesterday she ignored the trolls , but on the show , she told mr @entity5 : ' for me , it 's so disturbing			2
the name in its own right - " mansion tax "			2
' immediately you conjure up an image of these barbie-esque houses , but in @entity61 , which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live , have you seen what that amount of money can get you ? it 's like a garage			2
' she said those hit hardest would be ' the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years '			0
mr @entity5 responded : ' i totally understand that people do n't like paying more in tax			2
the values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government			0
' but former @entity21 ambassador to the @entity164 sir @entity128 joined in the debate and angrily told mr @entity5 : ' you 're going to screw me royally			1
' host @entity129 tried to calm things down , saying : ' @entity5 's getting a bit isolated here			1
' miss @entity2 interrupted : ' @entity5 's getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work			1
you may as well just tax me on this glass of water			2
you ca n't just point at things and tax them			0
you need to have a better strategy and say why is the @entity86 in this mess in the first place ? ' @entity5 admitted he has problems with photo opportunities , and suggested @entity183 could help him improve his image			1
the @entity1 leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘ not where my talents lie ' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich			1
he has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t - shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in @entity192			0
appearing on @entity193 on monday night , mr @entity5 held up a spoof newspaper front page , with the headline : ' @entity196 plays the @entity197			2
' it was a reference to @entity183 's expertise at the photo opportunity , and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of @entity204 , under the headline ' break the internet '			2
the images sparked countless spoofs online			0
explaining his front page , mr @entity5 said : ' you 'll know she ‘ broke ’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity			1
' now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities , me more than most , so i have decided to hire @entity183 to help me with the photo opportunities			2
' mr @entity5 was widely mocked after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich in may this year			0
he suggested he could learn from @entity183 , who appeared on the front cover of @entity204 last week under the headline : ' break the internet ' @entity2 says you can only buy a garage for £ 2million – in fact it 's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive @entity2 joked that in some parts of @entity61 buying a property for more than the proposed £ 2million mansion tax threshold would probably only stretch to a garage			1
but in fact it can secure a mansion in less fashionable parts of the capital and something even grander outside @entity61 - usually with a swimming pool , huge drive and extensive grounds			0
however , the singer is right about garages being expensive , because last month one in @entity245 sold for an eye - watering £ 550,000			0
overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in @entity61 and the @entity250 – will be caught by the tax			0
this is what £ 2million can buy you : @entity5 's own home near @entity256 , was bought in his then girlfriend , now wife @entity259 's name in 2009 for £ 1.6million , but is now thought to be worth around £ 2million			1
a four - bedroom semi-detached riverside home in @entity262 , @entity263 , was being sold with a guide price of £ 2,000,000 , in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years			0
there are also fears that , if the tax is introduced , the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting government revenue			0
in @entity277 , semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city , where homes sold for around £ 400,000 in the mid- 90s , are on sale for more than £ 2million			0
@entity54 chairman @entity53 has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value			1
this six - bedroom detached house in @entity286 , @entity283 is on sale for £ 2million , and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room			0
average prices on the street currently stand at £ 910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago			0
a neighbouring ten - bedroom property sold for £ 2million in 2005 , and is now thought to be worth £ 2,152,966			2
a guide price of £ 2,095,000 would buy this four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity296 , @entity32 , which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa			0
homes in the area sell for an average of £ 962,016 , an increase of 12 per cent from 2009			0
critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued , which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost			0
offers of around £ 2million are being taken for a four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity317 in @entity318 , an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009			0
it could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the @entity21 , and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky - rocketed and who now have a low - income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax			1
a three - bedroom detached house in @entity331 , outside @entity332 is on sale for £ 2.2m			0
there are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value , having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry			1
and for £ 550,000 ...			0
this dilapidated old shed , which doubled for a garage , in @entity245 , has been snapped up for £ 550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer			0

@entity1 candidate calls on @entity2 to leave @entity21 over remarks
comes after the former pop star attacked @entity5 's mansion tax plan
@entity1 wants to impose a levy on homes worth more than £ 2m
but @entity2 told him : ' you may as well just tax me on this glass of water '
viewers said she was ‘ doing a @entity14 ’ and ‘ wiping the floor ’ with @entity5
@entity1 's @entity367 slams singer and says ' what planet is she on ? '
