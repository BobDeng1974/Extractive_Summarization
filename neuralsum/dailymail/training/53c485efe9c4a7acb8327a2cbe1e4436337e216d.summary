by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 17 july 2013 @entity1 , the outspoken founder of @entity2 , posted a blog online regarding sex advice to his young daughters a @entity8 hedge fund manager has undoubtedly mortified his young daughters after recommending in a blog post that they bite the penis of any man who pressures them for oral sex			1
@entity1 , the outspoken founder of @entity2 , also added that he would buy his first gun if he ever discovered that someone had coerced one of his girls into a sexual act			1
@entity20 posted the column on his blog in response to a @entity25 article about college ' hookup ' culture and the prevalence of casual sex on campus			1
' how can so many smart young women be so massively stupid ? ! ' @entity20 wrote with a link to the @entity25 story			1
' getting drunk and / or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways , especially at such a young age and especially for young women			2
' @entity20 is married with three young daughters , two of whom are teenagers			1
referring to a part of the article where a young woman recalled being ordered by a man to ' get down on [ her ] knees , ' @entity20 writes , ' i certainly hope that my daughters would never spend a second with a guy who would ever dare say “ get down on your knees			1
" ' ' but if that happened , ' he continued , ' they would : a ) walk away b ) better yet , punch him in the mouth and walk away c ) better yet , kick him in the balls and walk away d ) better yet , pretend to go along with it , but when he pulls it out , squint , laugh , and walk away e ) better yet , bite it ! ' @entity1 ( right ) is pictured with his wife , @entity60			1
they have three young daughters after either injuring the man or embarrassing him ( or both ) , @entity20 advises his daughters to ' come home and tell me his name so i can by my first gun and ... well you get the idea ! ' @entity20 's advice , which was first reported by @entity72 , won wide praise on @entity74			1
' @entity75 ! ' tweeted @entity77 anchor @entity76			0
' this guy is freaking awesome , ' added @entity79 , a professor at @entity80			0
the managing editor of @entity77 , @entity81 , tweeted , ' as the father of twin girls , could n't agree with @entity1 more			1
@entity20 told the @entity84 that the bulk of responses to his post were from ' parents agreeing with my reaction			1
' but a handful of people also asked to be removed from a listserv that he emails regularly regarding education news			0
( he had sent the post to the listserv in addition to publishing it to his blog )			2
below is a copy of @entity106 's blog post , entitled : ' hookups replace dating on @entity109			1
' @entity110 has shortened @entity106 's excerpts from the @entity25 article , but otherwise the post is reprinted in full			2
' hookups replace dating on @entity109 a truly horrifying story from the front page of tomorrow ’s @entity25 ( especially if you have three daughters , the oldest two of which are teenagers )			2
how can so many smart young women be so massively stupid ? ! getting drunk and / or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways , especially at such a young age and especially for young women			2
[ from the @entity25 : ] it is by now pretty well understood that traditional dating in college has mostly gone the way of the landline , replaced by “ hooking up ” — an ambiguous term that can signify anything from making out to oral sex to intercourse — without the emotional entanglement of a relationship			1
hookups can lead to things like this : in november of @entity143 ’s freshman year , a couple of months after her first tentative “ @entity140 , ” or dance - floor makeouts , she went to a party with a boy from her floor			0
she had too much to drink , and she remembered telling him that she wanted to go home			0
instead , she said , he took her to his room and had sex with her while she drifted in and out of consciousness			2
a friend of hers , @entity153 ... had been making out with a guy at his house , not sure how far she wanted to go , when he stood up and told her , “ get down on your knees			0
” at first she froze			0
“ i was really taken aback , because i was like , no one has ever said that to me before , ” she said			0
then he said something like , “ ‘ i think that ’s fair , ’ ” she recalled			0
when she still hesitated , he pushed her down			0
“ it was at that point that i was like , ‘ i ’ll just do it , ’ ” she said			0
“ ' i was like , ' it will be over soon enough			0
' " i certainly hope that my daughters would never spend a second with a guy who would ever dare say “ get down on your knees ” – but if that happened , they would : a ) walk away b ) better yet , punch him in the mouth and walk away c ) better yet , kick him in the balls and walk away d ) better yet , pretend to go along with it , but when he pulls it out , squint , laugh , and walk away e ) better yet , bite it ! lastly , after doing any of a-e , come home and tell me his name so i can buy my first gun and ... well , you get the idea ! ;-) it ’s good to see that at least some women have some good sense – and very interesting that it ’s more likely to be those from “ modest ” ( i.e. , low income ) backgrounds : at colleges nationally , by senior year , 4 in 10 students are either virgins or have had intercourse with only one person , according to the @entity203			1
nearly 3 in 10 said that they had never had a hookup in college			0
[ researchers have ] found that the women from wealthier backgrounds were much more likely to hook up , more interested in postponing adult responsibilities and warier of serious romantic commitment than their less - affluent classmates .			0
