a same - sex penguin couple are putting their straight neighbours to shame after being dubbed the best penguin parents a @entity5 zoo has ever had			1
the @entity6 , called @entity7 and @entity8 , have taken on the chick of a female called @entity11 who had to abandon her egg to find food			1
it is the second egg the pair has been given , after the first failed to hatch last year , and this latest baby was born on 12 april			1
the two male @entity6 called @entity7 , pictured left , and @entity8 , pictured right , were given the egg earlier this year			1
it hatched on 12 april			1
the unnamed chick is pictured between the couple			1
the egg was laid by a female called @entity11 who had to abandon it to find food in may 2012 , a pair of same - sex @entity28 penguins called @entity29 and @entity30 adopted a chick at @entity32 in @entity33			1
but it is n’t just penguins that have been known to form same - sex relationships			2
domestic rams are statistically among the mammals most likely to form gay relationships , with 8 per cent of male sheep forming male - to - male bonds			2
@entity43 males have also been known to pair up , with relationships lasting as long as 17 years			2
while marine biologists have spotted bisexual activity in the bottlenosed species			0
homosexual wild @entity49 black swans sometimes form threesomes with two males and a female , which has led to higher breeding successes			2
this setup doubles the chance of reproduction , and the males can more effectively guard a nest against a predator			0
the male chick does n’t yet have a name			1
traditionally , zoos and wildlife parks wait to name a chick in case it does n’t survive , but a spokesman for the @entity68 told the @entity69 that he ’s doing ‘ really well ’ at the moment and the team are optimistic			1
with previous births , the park has run a competition on its @entity76 page to name chicks , and is planning to do the same once this baby is in the clear			0
the male couple first paired up in 2012 , effectively leaving two females without mates			0
@entity82 lays eggs each year with her partner @entity85 , but @entity85 refuses to incubate the egg forcing @entity82 to leave it to eat			1
staff at the park therefore stepped in with this recent chick , and gave the egg to the gay pair			2
during the official announcement on the park ’s @entity76 page , a spokesman said : ‘ @entity8 and @entity7 are a same - sex pair of penguins who bonded over two years ago			1
‘ while unable to reproduce themselves , we gave them an egg this year , which had been abandoned by one of our females			2
traditionally , zoos and wildlife parks wait to name a chick in case it does n't survive , but a spokesman for the @entity68 told the @entity69 the new chick , pictured , is doing ' really well ' at the moment and the team are optimistic			1
the male couple first paired up in 2012 ‘ @entity8 and @entity7 have since hatched this egg , and the one - month - old baby is showing that these two penguins are excellent surrogate parents , and dare we say some of the best penguin parents we have here			1
' @entity68 ’s owner @entity118 told the @entity119 : ‘ whilst pair bonding often results in no result other than eliminating those two animals from the breeding population of that species , in captivity it can have greatly positive effects			1
‘ we are still very much starting our breeding efforts with this species , and this is only our second year of breeding , but having such good surrogate parents available should we need them is a huge bonus for us			2
