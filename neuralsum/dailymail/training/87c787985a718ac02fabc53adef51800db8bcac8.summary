by @entity1 reporter published : 09:39 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 5 february 2013 for years it existed only in the wildest realms of science fiction			0
but now a team of leading roboticists have created a real bionic man - complete with artificial organs , synthetic blood and robot limbs goes			1
the astonishing creation incorporates some of the latest advances in prosthetic technology , as well as an artificial pancreas , kidney , spleen and trachea , and a functional blood circulatory system			1
but costing almost £ 640,000 , it is cheaper			1
known as @entity38 – short for robotic exoskeleton – his hi - tech frame is made up of an array of artificial limbs and organs from around the world			2
it was assembled for a new @entity46 documentary , how to build a bionic man and will go on display at @entity49 's @entity48 this week			1
on show : the world 's first complete @entity34 unveiled at the @entity48 in @entity49 today the @entity48 exhibit opening on thursday will explore changing perceptions of human identity against the background of rapid progress in bionics			0
in the documentary , to be screened at 9pm on thursday , experts at the forefront of the research talk to @entity21 social psychologist @entity20			2
mr @entity20 was born without a left hand and has a £ 30,000 bionic replacement with the ability to grip and twist			1
but although his hand is the most advanced on the market , it could soon be obsolete			2
in the programme @entity20 tries out the much more advanced modular prosthetic limb ( @entity71 ) , which teaches itself how to recognise tiny control signals from the upper arm			0
he also meets teams of @entity76 scientists who are restoring sight to the blind by implanting microchips in their retinas , and building artificial organs to replace failing lungs , kidneys , pancreases and spleens			1
saying hello : the world 's first ' bionic man ' , @entity38 , poses for photos at the @entity48 in @entity49 today the future is now : the @entity48 exhibit opening on thursday will explore changing perceptions of human identity against the background of rapid progress in bionics the bionic man pictured alongside the apparatus that allows him to stand : it incorporates some of the latest advances in prosthetic technology , as well as artificial organs and a functional blood circulatory system ' i 've looked around for new bionic technologies , out of personal interest , for a very long time and i think that until five or six years ago nothing much was happening , ' said mr @entity20			1
' then suddenly we are now at a point where we can build a body that is great and beautiful in its own special way			2
' @entity113 , senior commissioning editor for @entity114 , said : ' following @entity20 , who has a bionic arm himself , as he investigates the reality of building a bionic human takes this brilliantly made documentary into new territory			0
if what scientists can do now is jaw - dropping , the future is mind - boggling			0
' the project is supported by a @entity125 which aims to help the public explore biomedical science			0
scientists have built a man from artificial limbs known as @entity38 which is made up of limbs and organs from around the world @entity135 , director of medical humanities and engagement at the charity , said , quoting from the introduction to the one million dollar man : ' throughout history people have always sought to enhance themselves to overcome disabilities or to become ' bigger , better , stronger and faster '			1
' science is making aspirations and even fantasy ever more possible			0
we only have to look back at last summer 's @entity147 to see how transforming technology has become			0
' whilst exploring the latest medical developments , how to build a @entity34 hints at the implications these advances may raise for mankind in the future			0

team of roboticists build amazing humanoid *machine* costing £ 640,000
bionic man has artificial organs and a functional blood circulatory system
he is modelled on @entity21 man @entity165 , who has bionic hand himself
