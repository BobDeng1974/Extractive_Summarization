a young mother was forced to wait for half an hour after this selfish @entity2 driver parked just millimetres from her car			1
@entity4 , 27 , was left unable to get into her @entity5 after this shocking piece of parking in @entity8			1
the mother - of - one decided to shame the thoughtless driver of the navy blue @entity11 after they left their vehicle almost touching her own			1
' when i left the car there was a space next to it , but when i came back the car was parked like this , ' said the 27 - year - old , who was delayed collecting her daughter from nursery			1
' my first thought was '' how am i going to get out ? '' but then i thought '' how am i going to get in ? '' ' the car was parked so close to my mine i could n't get in , and i did n't think i 'd be able to climb over the child seat which is in the passenger seat			0
' but even if i did get into the car , i 'm not sure i would have been able to reverse out of there anyway			0
' when the driver of the navy blue 2007 @entity45 finally moved his car , there was no damage to her vehicle			2
the incident happened at the @entity54 car park in @entity8 on february 12			1
the mother - of - one was also worried about the damaging the @entity2 if she tried to reverse out the mother - of - one said : ' my first thought was ' how am i going to get out ? ' but then i thought ' how am i going to get in ? ' ' strangely enough i think i actually bumped into the driver who was having trouble with his ticket at the machine , ' said the photography student			1
' he was about 25 and wearing a suit			2
he looked a bit flash but i let him go ahead of me because i was waiting for an attendant so i could show him how the @entity2 had parked			2
' when the attendant arrived we went up the stairs to my car and the @entity2 had gone			2
the only person i had seen was the guy in the suit so i assume it must have been his car			0

the response has been incredible			0
