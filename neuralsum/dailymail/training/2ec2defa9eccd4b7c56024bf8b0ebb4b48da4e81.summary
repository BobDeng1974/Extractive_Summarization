the @entity0 launched an investigation after a listener complained that @entity4 , the imaginary scorer on long - running @entity6 comedy show @entity3 , was being treated as ' a sexual object '			1
the programme , which has been on the air for more than 40 years , features comics including @entity11 and @entity12 who regularly refer to the fictional ' lovely @entity4 ' - who does not actually exist			1
after a listener complained about two episodes in july last year which she said included ' highly sexist , offensive and harmful ' references to @entity4 , the @entity14 's @entity13 looked into the allegations before deciding not to proceed			1
@entity3 has had a number of regular panellists including host @entity11 ( pictured left ) a recently released @entity14 report said : ' she considered that @entity4 was only referred to as a sexual object and believed the male panellists used ' schoolboy sexist so - called humour ' , that was ' both puerile and unfunny '			1
' the report referred to examples of innuendo included on the show , including a description of the character as ' a lovely lady who 's scored on more desks than she can remember '			1
in one episode , listeners were told that @entity4 was going to the cinema with two men who were fans of horror films because ' she enjoys nothing better than sitting in the back row and being given the willies for 90 minutes '			1
the programme was defended by its producer , who said using innuendo was ' part of the programme 's tradition of wordplay and punning ' and was appreciated by ' the vast majority of listeners '			1
the programme features comics including @entity11 ( pictured ) and @entity12 who regularly refer to the fictional character of ' lovely @entity4 ' she was also told : ' the ' @entity4 ' character is a very long running joke in the show which listeners are very familiar with			1
' the listener took her complaint to the @entity14 and quoted a @entity66 @entity65 on @entity67 , who in discussing @entity69 society , had referred to a ' boys ' club sexist culture ' and said that the media was responsible for ' negative and over-sexualised portrayals of women '			2
a letter from a member of the @entity79 to the complainant said : ' you may be reassured to know that your complaint has prompted some lengthy and detailed discussion between senior managers at @entity86 and the producers of the show			2
' i think it is fair to say that a number of senior figures share , at least in part , your concerns about the manner in which @entity4 is portrayed in the programme			1
' i have discussed this with the @entity100 and she has asked me to tell you that she is currently in talks with the producer of the show about how to update the @entity4 character and has said that changes will be made to the way @entity4 is presented in the future			1
' the show 's producer also told the complainant in a letter that the show would book more female panelists and feature @entity112 , described as the ' male equivalent of @entity4 ' , more often			2
the producer added the show would make it clear that @entity4 was a ' willing even enthusiastic participant in the liaisons ' and stress that she was often the initiator in these relationships to avoid the suggestion that she was being taken advantage of			2
' it would make clear , the letter said , that ' @entity4 , like @entity112 , has a prodigious sexual appetite '			2
the @entity6 programme was defended by its producer who said using innuendo was ' part of the programme 's tradition of wordplay and punning ' and was appreciated by ' the vast majority of listeners ' the @entity14 's @entity13 said it ' could understand why some listeners believed that this type of humour was outdated ' , but said ' the majority of listeners were familiar with the content of the show and enjoyed the wordplay associated with the innuendo '			1
however , the @entity14 also decided the appeal ' did not qualify to proceed for consideration ' because it did not have a reasonable prospect of success			2
@entity3 is one of @entity6 's top - performing programmes and according to @entity0 research , has a higher proportion of female listeners than men			1
the @entity14 's @entity13 has five members and sets the editorial and content standards for the @entity0 , and oversees the editorial complaints process			1
a @entity0 spokesman said : ' we note and accept the findings of the @entity14			1
' ' @entity4 has to nip off now to meet the @entity163 ... they 'll light the candle then @entity4 will blow them out in the garden			2
' ' @entity4 has got to go off early to meet an entomologist friend who 's been showing her his collection of winged insects			0
they 've already covered his bees and wasps and tonight she 's hoping to go through his flies			0
' ' @entity4 has to nip out to the @entity176 with her constituency friend			0
he 's looking for support for his mp who 's facing expulsion , and @entity4 says it 's important to have a good peer if his member 's likely to be out			0
' ' @entity4 has to nip off to the @entity185 where she 's been giving private tuition to the singers			0
having seen what she did to the baritone , the director is keen to see what she might to for a tenor			0
' ' @entity4 's just started keeping bees and already has three dozen or so			0
she says she 's got an expert handler coming round to give a demonstration			0
he 'll carefully take out her 38 bees and soon have them flying round his head			0
' ' @entity4 has to go now as she 's off to meet her @entity202 gentleman friend who 's taking her out for an ice cream			0
she says she likes nothing better than to spend the evening licking the nuts off a large @entity206			0
' ' @entity4 tells me she has to pop out now as she does a few chores for an elderly gentleman who lives nearby			0
she shows him how to use the washing machine and then goes out to prune his fruit trees			0
later he 'll be hanging out his pyjamas as he watches her beaver away up the ladder			0
' ' after tasting the meat pies , @entity4 said she liked mr @entity219 's beef in ale , although she preferred his tongue in cider			0
