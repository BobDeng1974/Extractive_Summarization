the panel that cleared @entity3 defender @entity2 to play in the @entity5 final did not even consider his handball , the @entity0 has revealed			1
@entity2 saw his cup - final ban thrown out by a judicial panel tribunal on thursday after @entity3 challenged his one - game suspension for denying @entity10 an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberate handball			1
and it has emerged the @entity16 club 's lawyers successfully argued that @entity0 compliance officer @entity17 had no right to bring the case because match officials had seen the incident where @entity2 stopped a @entity23 header during his side 's 3 - 2 win over @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity3 defender @entity2 will be allowed to appear in @entity5 final after his ban was dismissed @entity2 was not sent off and no penalty was given as @entity3 went on to beat @entity10 3 - 2 after extra-time the @entity0 published the reasons given by the chair of the three - man panel			1
they read : ' further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving @entity2 , the panel considered initial submissions from mr @entity2 ' solicitor			1
' in particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter			1
' the panel considered that as the incident ( but not the actual alleged sending - off offence of handball ) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further			1
@entity49 chief executive @entity48 had warned before the verdict that the @entity0 was veering into dangerous territory ' it accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee			2
' the decision could effectively blunt the @entity0 's powers to bring retrospective cases against players , unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials			2
players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties			0
the rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending - off offences ' not seen by match officials '			2
the @entity2 case was brought because referee @entity72 and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender 's hand			2
@entity49 chief executive @entity48 had warned before the verdict that the @entity0 was veering into dangerous territory			0
he said : ' i think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country , players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely have n't been seen by the referee			0
' maybe a punch behind the referee 's back and fly kick when the ball is away			0
' but we think , if the rule has been extended , then it is now erring into re-refereeing a game on a monday			0
' that 's not the purpose of video evidence			0
that 's why the @entity100 and @entity101 and @entity102 steer away from that			0
the referee could see the incident on sunday , he just did n't see the handball			0

@entity3 defender @entity2 won appeal against one - match ban
the *22* - year - old was offered one - game suspension following incident
however , an *independent* judicial panel tribunal *overturned* decision
@entity3 reached the @entity5 final with 3 - 2 win over @entity10
