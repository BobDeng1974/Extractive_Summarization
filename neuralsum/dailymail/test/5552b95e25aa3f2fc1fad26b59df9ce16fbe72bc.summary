proud parents bragging about their little darling 's every move on @entity3 is a regular annoyance for many people using the social network			0
but one @entity8 woman got so sick of her friend 's constant updates about her baby daughter that she wrote her a scathing letter demanding the mother stop - claiming she is ' p * * * * * g a lot of people off '			1
@entity17 , 33 , was so upset by the ' poison pen ' note that she got her own back by forwarding it onto comedian @entity20 - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media			1
it adds : ' look we all have kids that we are besotted with - guess what - every parent thinks their child is the best			2
but we do n't ram it down everyone else 's neck ! ! ! ' she wears a new outfit - well take a photo and send it privately to the person who gave it to her - not to everyone ! ! ! ' she crawls off the mat - we do n't care ! ! ! ! ! she 's 6 months old - @entity70 ! ! ! ' stop and think - if every mother posted all that c * * p about their kid - i 'm sure you 'd get over it pretty quickly , ' we ca n't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you wo n't have time to be on @entity3 quite so much			1
' the letter claims to show what ' people really think ' about mother @entity17 's constant @entity3 updates , adding : ' we ca n't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you wo n't have time to be on @entity3 quite so much '			1
@entity17 says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘ backfired ’ , as she is ‘ feeling more loved and supported than ever ’ the dental hygienist still does n’t know who was responsible for the letter			1
@entity17 ca n’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty after saying they think the offending child is ' gorgeous ' and they ' love her ' , the writer continues - adding that ms @entity17 is ' p * * * * * g a lot of people off '			1
' we all thought it might ease off after the first month , but it has n't ' , it adds			1
not everyone is as interested as you are about what [ deleted ] does so give us all a break			0
' we 're doing this to let you know what people really think			0
' for ms @entity17 the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face , particularly as she is a first - time mother trying to find her feet			1
‘ i was actually excited when i checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite			0
never in my wildest dreams did i expect what was in it ! ’ @entity17 told @entity118			1
‘ at first i was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke			2
i read it and re-read it about four times			0
‘ i was shaking with anger and shock to think a so call friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name			0
’ the dental hygienist still does n’t know who was responsible for the letter			2
@entity17 ca n’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty			2
‘ to be honest i have no idea why anyone would do this to me			0
i do n’t think i have had an enemy in my whole life , ’ @entity17 told @entity118			2
@entity17 and her husband @entity140 ( pictured with their daughter @entity27 ) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter ‘ my husband @entity140 was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke			1
‘ these people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my @entity3 usage			0
it ’s quite sad really			0
’ the cruel nature of the letter spurred @entity17 to stand up for herself			1
she refused to bow down to the bullies , particularly when she released how damaging this kind of behaviour can be			0
‘ to have someone do this to me , in truth , makes me feel sick , ’ said @entity17			2
‘ @entity162 for me i am a strong , healthy person			0
being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences			0
‘ but it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter ! ’ however , @entity17 wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down			1
she has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby			2
‘ no way did i feel self - conscious or consider changing my online activity , ’ laughs @entity17			1
‘ that ’s how i think this person / people ca n’t be that close to me			0
‘ if they were they would know i would never take this lying down , start crying in the corner and then take myself off @entity3			0
' @entity17 says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘ backfired ’ , as she is ‘ feeling more loved and supported than ever ’			2
‘ the support i have received from family , friends and even total strangers has blown me away			0
’ rather , it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers @entity17 was accused of ' p * * * ing ' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on @entity3 comedian @entity20 wrote an 870 - word opinion piece about the letter for @entity8 website news.com.au , after @entity17 sent it to her through @entity3			1
questioning why the offended women did n't just speak to @entity17 or ' unfollow ' her on @entity3 , ms @entity20 said : ' it ’s not like she busted into their houses armed with life - size portraits of her child dressed as a tiny adorable pumpkin and demand that they be hung on every wall			1
' obviously in some people ’s opinion she ’s been overdoing it on the proud mother moments			0
worthy of an anonymous poison pen situation , no. ' ms @entity20 added the ' mean ' letter represents the ' @entity224 ' of anxiety			1
' it attacked her mothering , her self - perspective and probably left her feeling as though all her friends had turned on her ' she wrote			0
' it honestly does n’t feel as though “ the girls ” just wanted @entity17 to change a particular behaviour , ' it feels as though they wanted her to feel c * * p about herself			1
' if this were me i would have felt ambushed , alone and obsessed with finding out who “ the girls ” actually were so i may understand their motivation better			0
