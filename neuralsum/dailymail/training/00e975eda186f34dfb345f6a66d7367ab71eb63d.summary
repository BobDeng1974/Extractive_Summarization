he said she claimed she only received money to travel to @entity38 from @entity73 and financial support while she was there			2
' mr @entity13 , we say , is quite clearly a resource of far greater significance than the wife let on in the course of her evidence , ' claimed mr @entity74			0
' we say it is rather extraordinary that , less than three weeks after judgment was handed down , through his company in @entity38 he was offering to purchase ( the flat )			0
' what would happen is she would remain in occupation with £ 1.4 million in the bank , which was not the intention of mr @entity70			0

' even if the company controlled by mr @entity13 buys the former matrimonial home , this will still not be a property which the wife owns			2
' she will live there only by the permission of mr @entity13 and the fact that his company has made an offer - an insufficient offer , it would seem - does not materially change the facts as they were before mr @entity70			2
