if he was allowed to perform in the @entity5 i have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase			2
liberal democrat @entity6 ( right ) took the rare step of speaking out publicly to say she was lobbying home secretary @entity8 to refuse the self - styled dating coach a visa ' free speech is obviously hugely important , but with free speech comes responsibility			1

she said : ' it is important that respect for the laws on sexual assault and violence are upheld and that we send a clear message from @entity5 about zero tolerance of violence against women and girls			0
' mr @entity4 has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an ' executive coach ' at a company called @entity69 , which he calls an ' international leader in dating advice '			1
it promises customers the chance to ' witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations '			0
