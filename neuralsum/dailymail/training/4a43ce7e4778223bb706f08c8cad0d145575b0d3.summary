by @entity0 astronauts on the @entity2 can see as many as 16 sunrises and sunsets in a 24 - hour period			2
but on some occasions , the location of the station means the sun never sets at all , providing stunning views for the crew on board			0
now , @entity14 astronaut @entity13 has revealed this incredible sight from orbit , in the first ever vine video to be sent from space			1
in certain orbits of the @entity20 , the sun never sets on the @entity2 because the space station is in alignment with the day / night terminator line			1
this line marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the @entity20			1
in this scenario , something known as the ‘ beta angle ’ increases			0
this is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the @entity2 around @entity20			2
when beta angle exceeds 69º , it is in constant sunlight			0
this happens two to four times a year and is most extreme near the summer solstice on june 21			1
the timelapse condenses a 92 - minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at 17,500 mph ( 27,600 km / h )			1
the sun never sets because the space station 's orbit comes into alignment with the day and night terminator line			1

in this scenario , something known as the ‘ beta angle ’ increases			0
this is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the @entity2 around @entity20			2
writing in the @entity61 blog , @entity59 explained that as the beta angle gets higher , the time the @entity2 is in sunlight also increases			0
the sun never sets because the space station 's orbit comes into alignment with the day and night terminator line			1
this marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the @entity20 during this period , the so - called ‘ beta angle ’ increases			1
this is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the @entity2 around @entity20			2
as the beta angle gets higher , the time the @entity2 is in sunlight increases			0
when beta angle exceeds 69º , it is in constant sunlight ‘ when beta angle exceeds 69º , it is in constant sunlight , and mission control keeps an even closer around - the - clock watch on power production and temperatures , ’ he said			0
‘ this happens two to four times a year but is most extreme near the summer solstice coming on june 21			1
’ previous space shuttles would enter something known as a ‘ barbeque mode ’ which would cause them to do slow barrel rolls to avoid overheating			0
on the @entity2 , an @entity94 transfers heat through to large radiators extending under the station that can then be released into space			0
@entity13 from @entity98 ( pictured ) is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the @entity2 for @entity100			2
@entity13 ’s space @entity101 has gained over 4,000 likes and nearly 2,000 retweets since it was posted on saturday ‘ 1st @entity101 from space ! single @entity20 orbit			1
@entity110 never sets flying parallel w / terminator line , ’ @entity13 explained in the clip , which he shared over the weekend			1
@entity101 is a mobile service that creates short looping videos which are six seconds or less			0
so far , @entity13 ’s @entity101 has gained over 4,000 likes and nearly 2,000 retweets			2
the 38 - year - old from @entity98 is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the @entity2 for @entity100			0
the last time @entity115 saw a space ‘ first ’ was when astronaut @entity117 sent the first tweet from orbit in 2009			0
' my parents were waving in @entity122 at sunrise , so i took a picture of them , ' @entity13 wrote with this shot			0

@entity101 was created by @entity14 astronaut @entity13 over the weekend
timelapse condenses 92 - minute orbit into the span of around six seconds
@entity110 never sets because @entity2 ' orbit is in alignment with the ' terminator ' line
terminator line marks barrier between light and dark on @entity20 's surface
this happens up to four times a year but is most common around the time of the summer solstice
