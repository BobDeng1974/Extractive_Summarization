three were declared dead sunday morning alone from apparent heroin overdoses in @entity12 and officials warn the situation now looks startlingly like the crisis of 1988 when 18 @entity16 were killed by a powerful synthetic heroin called @entity18			1
many of those who died in the last week possessed heroin bags marked ' @entity22 ' and subsequent tests revealed they contained a drug 100 times more powerful than morphine called fentanyl			1
' somebody is making this somewhere in a clandestine laboratory			0
' @entity43 is manufactured as a legal pain killer , but authorities suspect the fentanyl that laced the heroin was made in an illegal lab ' by some clever chemists			1
' @entity12 sees about one overdose case per day , @entity34 said			0
what 's happened in the past week is extremely out of the ordinary			0
' we usually deal with 250 drug overdoses a year so what ’s going on is really significant , ' he told the @entity57			0
@entity43 resembles heroin , though it is much more potent , and it has been blamed for dozens of deaths around the @entity60 been here before ? found in some of the @entity22 bags was the super-potent narcotic @entity22 , which officials like @entity12 medical examiner dr. @entity34 ( right ) says makes the recent rash of deaths eerily similar to the 1988 @entity18 epidemic @entity18 : in 1988 , 18 were killed in the @entity4 area by a drug called 3 - methylfentanyl , a sort of synthetic heroin with the street name @entity18 each of the people who died in the rash of overdoses has a known history of drug abuse , particularly heroin , @entity34 said			1

the area has seen periodic rises in the overdose rate , notably in 1988 when a potent chemical called 3 - methylfentanyl , @entity87 , was introduced to heroin users in the area , killing 18 of them			1
it remains to be seen if each of the recent victims died due to heroin laced with fentanyl			2
' i do n’t know yet what we ’ll find in the bodies of these people , ' @entity34 said , though something is clearly out there causing the steep rise in heroin - related deaths			2
' we ’re obviously dealing with a major public health crisis , ' he said , something ' bringing to mind the very localized @entity18 epidemic we had in 1988			2
