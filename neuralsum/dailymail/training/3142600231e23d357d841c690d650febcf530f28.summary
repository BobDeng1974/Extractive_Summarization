criticism : @entity1 , pictured outside 10 @entity2 , said @entity4 executives feared uncensored debate the @entity4 made a ‘ terrible mistake ’ by not reflecting the public ’s concerns about immigration , its political editor has admitted			1
@entity1 said that during @entity12 ’s years in government , @entity4 executives feared an uncensored debate about the issue would stoke racism			1
as a result , viewers ’ concerns about pressure on jobs and wages , and cultural tensions were not aired as the @entity4 ‘ had decided these are not acceptable views – and that was a terrible mistake ’			1
claiming that attitudes have changed , mr @entity1 was speaking ahead of tomorrow ’s screening of his documentary @entity30 , which is set to reveal new data about the scale of public concerns			1
however , amid debate over the lifting of controls this month on @entity38 and @entity39 coming to settle in @entity40 , critics say the @entity4 still has some way to go			2
as recently as november , the broadcaster was giving uncritical blanket coverage to a report about the economic benefits of immigration that was dismissed as ‘ fatally flawed ’ by @entity47 , one of the country ’s most senior statisticians			0
sir @entity50 , of the think - tank @entity51 , said : ‘ @entity1 is right – the @entity4 has a lot to answer for			2
‘ they were largely silent as immigration rose from 50,000 a year to 250,000 a year under the previous government and as net foreign migration reached nearly 4million			0
‘ their coverage has improved a little in the face of overwhelming public opinion , which many of them seem to despise			0
’ mr @entity1 said in interviews at the weekend that the public ‘ deserve the truth because although immigration has been top of the political agenda , the real debate about it has scarcely begun ’			1
controversial : mr @entity1 said that whether to allowi @entity70 leader @entity68 caused ' huge argument ' in the run - up to eight @entity80 countries joining the @entity81 in the early 2000s , @entity4 managers ‘ feared having a conversation about immigration ’ as they believed it would ‘ unleash some terrible side of the @entity40 public ’			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ the same people who said you could n’t have [ @entity70 leader ] @entity68 said : “ do n’t talk about this			1
do you know what you ’re going to unleash ? do you know the horrors that are going to come ? ” ‘ there was huge argument within the @entity4 about that			2
’ he said his documentary would go through the ‘ mistakes and miscalculations ’ about immigration numbers made by the @entity12 government			0
fear : mr @entity1 said that ever since @entity98 ( pictured ) gave his infamous ' @entity100 ' speech in 1968 , the @entity4 has shied away from discussing immigration accusing the @entity4 of being ‘ too slow to recognise and reflect the concern , dislocation and anger felt by many ’ , he said : ‘ we worried too much about airing views that might offend some viewers and listeners and not enough by the offence caused to people who did not hear their own concerns reflected on air			1
that , i am happy to say , has now changed			0
’ mr @entity1 said the country was beginning to have an honest discussion about immigration , and the fact that it might result in greater competition for jobs , housing and school places , while also benefiting the economy as a whole			1
in the same interview , mr @entity1 did not deny that there was rivalry between him and @entity127 , the @entity4 ’s economics editor			1
‘ we ’re not mates , ’ he said			0
‘ he ’s not part of my social circle			0
are we fairly assertive individuals ? yes , probably – removing the word “ fairly ”			0
’ former @entity135 cabinet minister @entity134 , a regular @entity4 contributor , said : ‘ the @entity4 has failed in the immigration debate over a 40 - year period			2
‘ ever since the @entity98 speech [ about immigration in 1968 ] , there has been such a fear that immigration equals racism that the @entity4 and other outlets have banished reporting the full facts for fear of stoking racism			2
’ in an interview in 2011 , the @entity4 ’s former director - general @entity149 admitted that there had been ‘ some years ’ when the broadcaster was ‘ very reticent about talking about immigration ’			0
he added : ‘ there was an anxiety about whether or not you might be playing into a political agenda if you did items on immigration			0

mr @entity1 said @entity4 executives were *afraid* of uncensored debate
he said @entity162 decided some concerns were ' not acceptable '
