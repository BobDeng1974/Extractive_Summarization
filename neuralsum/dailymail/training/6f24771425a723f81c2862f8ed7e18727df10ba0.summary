by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:17 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 12:14 est , 11 march 2014 interest rates could rise in months before the general election , regeardles on the impact on voters , @entity3 revealed today			1
the @entity9 governor said it would be ‘ a welcome time ’ when rates do rise from their record lows , but other factors would play a part in deciding when to begin an increase			1
mr @entity3 struck an upbeat tone , claiming the ‘ end of the recovery is in progress ’ but @entity20 will continue to face ‘ extraordinary times ’ for many years			2
@entity9 governor @entity3 told the treasury select committee it would be a ' welcome time ' when rates do rise @entity9 interest rates have been at 0.5 per cent for more than five years as a result of the financial crash and the recession which followed			1
mr @entity3 had set a target of unemployment falling to 7 per cent before he would consider increasing the cost of borrowing , but six months later strong jobs growth meant that figure has almost been reached already			0
today he argued that the better - than - expected recovery would mean the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing was now a ‘ welcome ’ possibility			2
but he rejected the idea that the timing of the general electon , due on may 7 , 2015 , would play a part			0
a rise in interest rates ahead of polling day would be a boost for savers who have seen £ 300billion wiped off the value of their nest eggs			1
there is a ' distinct possibility ' that the @entity53 would have to move outside of @entity54 if voters back independence , @entity3 warned			0
mps were also told that the rest of the @entity20 was likely to end up bailing out @entity54 in the event of a crisis if there was a currency union even if there were explicit guarantees written into an agreement ruling out such an event			0
@entity69 laws that require banks to have their head offices in the same member state as their registered offices would be likely to hit @entity54 , the treasury select committee heard			0
asked if @entity53 would have to move to the remaining @entity20 if an independent @entity54 joined the @entity74 , mr @entity3 said : ' it 's a distinct possibility but i should n't prejudge it			0
' it depends on their arrangements as well , if they were to adjust more into @entity54 the minor management of the institution			0
' it came amid claims an independent @entity54 could face a deficit at least £ 3 billion greater than @entity86 has claimed			2
the @entity87 has estimated that the country would have a deficit of 3.2 per cent of @entity90 , or £ 5.5 billion , but that figure is up to 2.2 per lower than projections by other organisations including think tanks , @entity95 and the @entity96			2
@entity54 secretary @entity97 said mr @entity86 's position was ' bereft of any credibility ' as he urged the nation not to ' walk away from one of the most successful political , economic and social unions that the world has ever seen '			0
but homeowners could suddenly find themselves faced with bigger mortgage bills as they ponder whether they want @entity106 or @entity107 in @entity108			0
earlier this year @entity109 , a member of the @entity110 , suggested it would be ‘ difficult ’ for rates to rise during the election campaign			1
but mr @entity3 insisted the timing would not be affected by politics			0
he told @entity57 : ‘ when the time comes - a welcome time - to raise rates , we expect it to be gradual and the degree to be limited ‘ we will still be living in extraordinary times a few years down the road , " he added , referring to the slow recovery in @entity69 , emerging market turmoil and higher borrowing costs in financial markets			1
' the central bank boss told the @entity127 his flagship forward guidance policy had helped drive the bounce back in the economy , despite having to abandon linking rates to unemployment after just six months			1
committee chairman @entity134 said the @entity9 appeared to be ‘ back to where it started ’ with rate - setting based on a variety of economic indicators , as it was before forward guidance was first introduced last august			1
the pledge to link rates to unemployment had been well understood by businesses , giving them confidence to make hiring and spending decisions , which has in turn boosted the recovery , he said			2
mr @entity3 added : ‘ we are moving to a period where the end of the recovery is in progress and the start of expansion should happen this year and we are moving to a period where the more conventional operation of monetary policy is a possibility , which is welcome			0
’ he admitted the @entity9 's forecasts had been woefully wrong , having first predicted unemployment would not reach 7 per cent until 2016 - a threshold that is set to be hit within months			1
it has been holding an internal review of its forecasting capability and is set to report the findings next week , he said			0
the bank last week held rates once more , marking the five - year anniversary of its decision to slash rates to the historic low of 0.5 per cent			1
but members of the @entity110 have repeatedly signalled that rates may rise next year as the economic recovery picks up pace , with the market expecting a hike at the start of the second quarter			1
shadow chancellor @entity178 warned that mr @entity3 may be forced to raise interest rates earlier than he wishes by the ‘ lopsided ’ housing market , which has seen prices rise much faster in @entity182 and the @entity183 than in other parts of the country			1
mr @entity178 urged the government to build more houses to bring demand for homes more in line with supply			0
and he called for a cut in the £ 600,000 limit for support under the help to buy scheme .			2
