by @entity0 published : 10:52 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 10:56 est , 8 september 2012 lord @entity1 today attacked the @entity3 press for ' resorting to type ' today , accusing them of focusing more on @entity6 's football match with @entity7 then on one of the last days on the @entity9			1
he said newspapers bumped the @entity9 off the back pages usually reserved for sport to concentrate on @entity6 's football win most papers carried @entity6 's 5 - 0 victory over @entity7 to lead their sports coverage , as @entity18 's men opened their @entity20 campaign with their biggest away win for nearly two decades			1
priorities : lord @entity1 accused the press of focusing on @entity6 's football performance , instead of the @entity9 @entity1 says the future of @entity9 sport rests on the press ' coverage it came on a relatively barren day for @entity30 , as discus thrower @entity31 won @entity34 's tenth athletics gold of the @entity9 - but the only top medal of the day			1
her success came nine years after breaking her neck in a car accident , the 26 - year - old setting three world records on her way to claiming the discus title			1
lord @entity1 emphasised that without the press ' involvement , the interest around the @entity9 could fade if they did not keep up reports			1
asked how the profile of @entity9 sport could be maintained after the @entity9 , @entity1 said : ' with your ( press ) help			1
' the future of @entity9 sport in large part lies with you , your editors and the ability of broadcasters to take this beyond the three or four weeks that we 've witnessed here			1
' it is a challenge for @entity58 , it is a challenge for @entity59			2
' in an apparent attack on @entity9 coverage in today 's newspapers , the @entity61 chairman criticised ' the speed with which we reverted to back - page leads for @entity6 - @entity7 '			1
he added : ' that relegation happened too quickly			2
we ( the @entity69 ) could not have done more in the last seven years to move this on			2
' it now sits in a large part with you guys			2
' we will go on showing that @entity9 sports is an extraordinary sport			1
' the speed with which we resorted to type last night was maybe not a great sign			0
