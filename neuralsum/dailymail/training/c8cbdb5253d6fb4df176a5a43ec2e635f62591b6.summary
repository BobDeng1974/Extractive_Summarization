the lover and gardener of @entity3 expatriate @entity2 , who was reported missing from her @entity5 home last month , has allegedly confessed to killing her and hiding her body in a thicket close to a pond			1
@entity9 was charged with miss @entity2 ’s murder and remanded in custody shortly after she vanished			1
he has repeatedly denied any involvement in the 58 - year old ’s disappearance , remaining ‘ walled in silence ’ , according to a police source			1
clue : blood from @entity2 , right , was found in a car belonging to @entity9 , pictured left in 1990 but a fellow inmate of @entity21 , 50 , phoned prosecutors from inside the prison in which they were both being held – claiming that he had admitted his guilt to him			1
he told them : ‘ @entity9 said they ’d had a fight			1
he hit her and then realised she was dead			2
he panicked and hid the body in a thicket close to a pond			2
’ police took the claim seriously as the inmate had risked imminent freedom by getting in touch			0
he had called on an illicit mobile on the eve of his release from a long sentence			0
after the call , officers began an intensive search close to the £ 250,000 stone cottage north of @entity45 that was renovated by former advertising executive @entity46 and her partner @entity47 on their arrival five years ago			1
mr @entity47 , 54 , returned to the @entity3 about a year ago for medical treatment – apparently disillusioned with life in rural @entity5			0
police say @entity9 and miss @entity2 began a relationship in april but split in july			1
curious neighbours of @entity46 in the @entity55 village of @entity56 were told that the new search was simply part of the ongoing investigation , which had been scaled down to a handful of officers aided by forensic specialists			0
after the inmate ’s revelations , @entity9 was secretly taken back to the cottage , along with the trial judge , so that clothing and other items could be removed from the scene in his presence			2
@entity5 police comb woodland near @entity74 's cottage			2
unless @entity9 leads them to its location , miss @entity2 's body may never be found however , police are now privately admitting that unless @entity9 , their only suspect , confesses and leads them to the spot , miss @entity2 ’s body may never be found			1
a police source said : ‘ we are searching for a needle in a haystack in a vast rural territory – woods , dense forests plunging to the gorges of the @entity88 , dozens of lakes , ponds , even abandoned houses , all perfect for hiding a body			1
the only person who can lead us to her is her killer			0
’ all evidence appears to point to the tall , semi-itinerant odd - job man and gardener as the killer			0
even his lawyer , @entity100 , agrees that police do not seem to be looking at any other leads			2
police say friends told them that the relationship between @entity9 and miss @entity2 was tumultuous and stormy , with many arguments and fights			1
shortly after they got together , she allowed him to move in with her from the caravan he inhabited several miles away			0
but she threw him out six weeks later and , according to friends and police , he began a campaign of harassment			0
on one occasion , it is alleged , he broke into her cottage to prove she was n’t safe alone			0
yet other expats in the 500 - strong village , and friends and family of the shy , quietly reclusive @entity21 , do not believe he is a killer			0
a relative said : ‘ we ’re a large , extended family and , unlike most @entity5 , do n’t have constant contact			0
@entity9 was always a bit of a hippy			2
we know little of his life but we do know he was gentle and kind – and never cruel			0
we thought of him as a good man			0
’ @entity2 's home in the hamlet of @entity130 , between @entity45 and @entity131 , in @entity5 other expats who employed him as an odd - job man also spoke of his kindness and quiet ability			1
but police believe that he attacked miss @entity2 on the steps of her cottage and dragged her down to his car			1
blood and dna in his @entity144 saloon matched miss @entity2 ’s – and forensic officers found her dna on other items inside the car			1
traces on his mobile phone also put @entity9 close to the house at the time she is said to have disappeared			2
prosecutors say @entity9 will not face a court before next year at the earliest .			0
