by @entity0 the coy residents of a small @entity3 town have been so shocked by a replica of @entity7 ’s @entity6 sculpture of a naked @entity8 that they have called for it to be fitted out in underpants			1
the 16ft replica of the classic sculpture has been put up in a park in @entity16 where , standing on a plinth , it towers over everyone visiting the area to use the nearby running track , baseball stadium and tennis courts			1
it is also close to a children ’s play area , which is of added concern to residents who have objected to the statue ’s nudity			2
the 16ft replica of the masterpiece in @entity16 town government has caused a stir among residents who say its ' nakedness ' is scaring children and it should wear underpants ‘ it ’s frightening the children and worrying the adults with its nakedness ’ said a town official			1
‘ several people have asked us to cover it up with underpants			0
’ the statue , along with a replica of @entity50 treasure the ‘ topless ’ @entity51 , was presented to the town by a businessman who comes from the area			1
both statues were erected in a prominent position in the park and while many residents have appreciated the gift , some have admitted they are worried about the blatant nakedness on display			2
‘ some people have told the town ’s legislators that toddlers are afraid of the statues because they are so big and they appeared unexpectedly over the summer , ’ said mr @entity64 , a town official			2
‘ they are statues of unclothed humans , and such pieces of art work are very rare in our area			1
‘ some people apparently said the statues might not be good for their children			0
' it ’s the first time we have had anything like this in our town			0
’ town official @entity84 says art featuring ' unclothed humans ' such as @entity8 , left , and ancient statue @entity51 , right , is rare in @entity3 and while many locals who live in the mountainside town of fewer than 15,000 residents have welcomed the new cultural additions , some have asked for @entity8 to be fitted out with underwear ‘ to preserve modesty ’ , said the @entity95 newspaper			1
local officials said they hoped that residents would in time come to appreciate the value of the sculptures , which could be useful in school art classes and even be a sightseeing attraction			2
nudity is a questionable subject in @entity3			0
earlier this week @entity105 photographer @entity104 , who lives in @entity106 , was arrested for selling books containing photos of male genitals			0
the 41 - year - old photographer ’s subjects have included @entity112 and @entity113 , but authorities have decided that – despite what the western world might think - male nudity is a far cry from pop stars and if he is convicted of obscenity he could be jailed for up to two years			0
under local laws , genitals must be obscured in books , magazines and the internet , a process usually carried out through pixellation .			0
