he is one of @entity2 ’s wealthiest hedge fund tycoons , with a fortune of hundreds of millions of pounds			1
but sir @entity5 ’s lifestyle is far more ‘ @entity8 ’ watch than ‘ jet - set ’ , according to a high court judge			1
he was speaking at the outset of what could be @entity2 ’s first billion - pound divorce case			2
split : @entity14 ( left ) believes her former husband sir @entity5 ( right ) is richer than he claims and is not being generous with his settlement sir @entity5 sat just feet away from his estranged @entity19 - born wife , @entity18 , as the couple began their legal fight over the size of her financial settlement			1
mrs @entity26 , 49 , claims their joint assets were about £ 849million and her husband is worth at least a further £ 872million from personal assets in his hedge fund – @entity34 group of companies – making a combined wealth of £ 1.72billion			1
acrimonious : mrs @entity26 believes she is entitled to half of her husband 's wealth but sir @entity5 , knighted last month in the @entity40 , claims he is worth a mere £ 67million and that much of his wealth was built up after they separated			1
the 47 - year - old ‘ non-dom ’ says therefore his wife is entitled to only a quarter of his wealth			2
last month she failed in a @entity47 bid to have expert evidence of sir @entity5 ’s assets submitted in the settlement case			1
the couple separated in december 2012 and divorced in april 2013 but the decree nisi has never been made absolute			0
yesterday the @entity53 heard that despite the tycoon ’s incredible ability to make money on the financial markets the couple lived ‘ modest lives ’			0
@entity60 , @entity61 , for mrs @entity26 , said : ‘ both are from modest backgrounds , neither brought any assets into the marriage			2
’ he added : they have led relatively modest lives			0
they have not led a jet - set lifestyle			0
’ referring to sir @entity5 ’s image of frugality mrs @entity70 added : ‘ it was more of a @entity8 [ watch ] lifestyle			1
’ despite this reputation sir @entity5 has ‘ spent his whole life making money ’ earning up to £ 24.2million a year , @entity74 told the court			1
‘ he has generated wealth of £ 3.45billion			0
’ difference : sir @entity81 puts a value of only £ 67million on the company ’s net assets			1
but his wife claims his shares are worth more than £ 872million , and their combined fortune is £ 1.72billion the son of a @entity90 immigrant to @entity2 , sir @entity5 grew up in @entity91 and is known for his simple lifestyle			1
he reportedly lives in a rented house , drives a @entity94 and wears a black @entity8 watch he has had for years			0
the couple met as students at @entity98 and married in 1985			0
they have four children – triplets aged 12 and an older child aged 15			0
they have homes in @entity103 , the @entity19 and the @entity104			0
but yesterday the court heard mrs @entity26 and the children live in rented accommodation			0
sir @entity5 has also become one of the @entity2 ’s leading philanthropists after giving more than £ 1billion to charity through the @entity112 , which is linked to his hedge fund			1
and it is as chairman of the @entity112 that mrs @entity26 claims she contributed to the couple ’s combined wealth			2
yesterday she took the stand to give evidence			0
a court order bans the reporting of what she said			0
whatever the outcome the divorce settlement is likely to be the biggest in @entity2 history , beating the £ 220million paid in 2011 by the late @entity129 oligarch @entity128			2

sir @entity5 , 49 , is one of @entity2 's wealthiest philanthropists
his wife , @entity137 ( @entity137 ) @entity5 claims he was richer than he *suggests*
the pair can not decide over how their estate should be divided up
mrs @entity143 believes their joint assets are worth around £ 1.72billion
but mr @entity5 , who was knighted last month , says he is worth only £ 67million
