@entity1 's boots , @entity3 's cloak , and a blood - stained saw used to amputate an aristocrat 's leg are among the extraordinary artefacts from the @entity8 which have gone on display to mark the its 200th anniversary			1
the historic objects are among 200 digital images which are being posted on a website intended to give the public new insight into the 1815 conflict in @entity16			1
others include a breastplate with a huge hole where a @entity21 cannonball smashed through it , killing the unlucky soldier , and dentures made from the teeth of troops who 'd fallen in the battle			1
historic : @entity1 's boots , left , and @entity3 's cloak , right , are among the artefacts in a new online exhibition on the @entity8 destroyed : this cuirass was worn by a @entity35 soldier who was killed by a cannonball on the battlefield gruesome : a blood - stained glove and saw used by a field surgeon to amputate the leg of the @entity41 the collection was assembled from the holdings of the @entity44 in @entity45 , and supplemented with loans from other museums and private collections			1
the first 100 objects in the collection , which is known as ' @entity51 ' , are currently available to view on the project 's website , and the others will be added in the run - up to the actual anniversary date on june 18			2
a pair of boots worn by the @entity1 were designed by the @entity21 general himself to be suitable both on the battlefield and at high - society parties			1
they took off on @entity45 's social scene after he led @entity21 to victory , and to this day rubber boots are still known as ' @entity66 ' in his honour			2
@entity3 's cloak , also featured in the online exhibition , is decorated with @entity72 designs , reflecting his fascination with the @entity74 , and was worn by the @entity35 leader on the night before @entity8			2
artefacts : a coin which stopped a bullet and saved a soldier 's life is pictured left , while on the right is part of the spine of a less lucky soldier opponents : on the left is a medal given to every @entity21 soldier who fought at @entity8 , and right is a @entity35 standard captured at the battle the @entity8 on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of @entity3 across @entity92 and sent the great @entity35 emperor into exile for a second and final time			1
@entity35 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the @entity21 army under the command of the @entity1			2
the armies amassed near the town of @entity8 in modern - day @entity16 , not far from the border with @entity35 , and it was the @entity35 who made the first move around 11am			0
the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the @entity21 fending off repeated attacks from the @entity35 , until @entity108 arrived at the head of a @entity111 army			0
this was the decisive intervention which finished @entity3 off , allowing @entity1 to counter-attack and forcing the @entity35 to surrender			0
the battle forced @entity3 from the throne of @entity35 , leading to his exile on @entity118 - but @entity1 later admitted it was ' the nearest - run thing you ever saw in your life '			0
despite the popular image of @entity8 as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the @entity35 bearing the brunt of the losses			0
many of the objects featured , however , relate not to the great generals but to the ordinary soldiers who bore the brunt of the slaughter in the battle			1
one is a @entity21 penny which apparently prevented the death of an infantryman by stopping a bullet - it now bears a deep indentation where the projectile struck it			1
@entity8 was the first battle in which every @entity21 serviceman was recognised for his contribution by a special medal , and one of the medals is featured in the exhibition			0
@entity150 , of @entity151 , said : ' @entity8 is significant because it was the first to recognise the bravery of both the famous general and the unknown private by giving every man who took a part a medal , something which had never happened before 1815			0
' some of the objects in the archive are notably macabre - one is a piece of spine extracted from the body of a @entity21 soldier and given to his widow as a memento			1
a blood - stained saw and glove used by a field surgeon to amputate the @entity41 's leg after he was injured at @entity8 is also featured , as is the wooden artificial leg worn by the peer after his injury			1
it is said that when @entity41 was shot on the battlefield he turned to @entity1 saying , ' by @entity178 , sir , i ’ve lost my leg ! ' , and the general replied , ' by @entity178 , sir , so you have ! ' a @entity35 cuirass worn as body armour by a soldier is punctured by a huge hole apparently caused by a cannonball which easily penetrated the breastplate and killed its wearer			1
another unlucky participant was corporal @entity190 , a well - known boxer before he was called up to @entity8 and killed - the virtual exhibition features a plaster cast of his skull made shortly after his death the battle turned @entity1 , later to become prime minister , into a national hero , and the effect it had on his fame is shown by a sign he was forced to put up at his country house in @entity205			0
the sign reads : ' those desirous of seeing the interior of the house are requested to ring at the door of entrance and to express their desire			0
it is wished that the practice of stopping on the paved walk to look in at the windows should be discontinued			0
' as well as photographs of the 200 artefacts , the @entity51 website will host details of every event around @entity21 being held to celebrate the battle 's bicentenary			1
@entity226 , director - general of the @entity44 , said : ' the museum is really excited to see some of its most unique and fascinating objects featured in the online gallery alongside such a broad range of other collections			2
' each item featured tells an interesting story transporting viewers back to 1815 and give them a real feel for the moments before , during and after the battle			0
' another exhibition - this one physical rather than online - is being hosted by @entity240 , where @entity241 dedicated a whole room to portraits of those who fought at @entity8			0
exhibition : another display of artefacts marking the battle 's 200th anniversary is opening soon at @entity240 memorial : the castle 's @entity250 was built by @entity241 to commemorate those who led the @entity21 army to victory			2
