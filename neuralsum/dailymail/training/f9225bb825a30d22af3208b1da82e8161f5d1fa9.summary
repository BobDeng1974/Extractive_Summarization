canary babies : @entity1 , now 97 , said she was born with yellow - tinged skin the @entity3 left a taint on everyone - but for some it happened more literally than others			1
now 97 , @entity1 is one of @entity8 's last surviving ' @entity9 ' , born yellow because her mother worked on the @entity12 pouring dangerous chemicals into shells			1
she has long since lost her yellow glow , but claims it affected many of the children born where she still lives in @entity20 , @entity21			1
more than 1,500 people there worked in @entity24 on the outskirts of @entity20 during the @entity3			1
as many of them were women , they became known as the ' @entity28 ' when their skin became tainted by touching chemicals in the @entity32 powder they poured into bombs			2
traditional gunpowder had been replaced by materials such as cordite and sulphur which were mixed by hand despite being dangerous to human health			0
the women 's skin would break out into hives , their hair would be discoloured and although there were few injuries at @entity20 , those in other factories lost their lives and limbs when explosives went off prematurely			1
less well known was that the same yellow colouring would apparently happen to their children - who were dubbed the ' @entity9 '			0
mrs @entity1 's mother @entity54 was in charge of a full team of women at the factory in @entity20 , one of the largest of its kind in the country			1
her father , meanwhile , would accompany the filled shells by train to the coast where they would be shipped off to the front line on the continent			0
@entity70 brought in a doctor to examine her daughter , but was told there was nothing she could do - and the colour faded within a short time			0
it seemed none of her family ever investigated whether there was a long - term risk to her health , but as far as mrs @entity1 knows she suffered no ill effects - and she is still going strong at 97			1
canary girls : the women in munitions factories have been honoured after suffering burns and skin rashes			1
though there were few injuries at @entity20 , some at other factories were blown up or maimed war effort : @entity1 's mother @entity54 ( left with her husband ) led a team of women such as the one right ' nearly every baby was born yellow , ' she said			1
' @entity100 said you just took it for granted it happened and that was it			0
you were tougher in those days than what they are today ! ' @entity24 is now in a field overgrown with brambles			2
there is little to betray its former use - but because of it , the land is a protected site of archaeological significance			0
@entity1 's remarkable tale was revealed when she told her story to a volunteer project for the town 's @entity118			2
they decided to record her experiences for posterity - one set among 1,400 in a new nationwide project by the @entity125 and the @entity126 to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war			0
women on the @entity12 : photographer @entity130 captured human scenes of wives and daughters working underappreciated : the women often risked their lives to make sure the country kept running during the war @entity138 is showcasing first - hand accounts of life on the @entity12 in a series of broadcasts on @entity126 local radio stations , designed to link people to the war town by town			0
mrs @entity1 's story was broadcast on monday on @entity148			1
@entity149 , a researcher on the project , said : ' the chemicals that turned the women 's skin yellow seemed to be very particular to the women who were working at close quarters to explosives			2
' to have somebody still alive who can talk about something like this that happened 100 years ago is quite remarkable			0
' @entity126 head of @entity162 programmes @entity163 said : ' these stories reveal familiar places across the nation in a new and fascinating light ; places that we might drive or walk past every day without realising their historical resonance			0
' these stories would have remained little - known about without the involvement of the many partners and organisations across the country who have supported our journalists in bringing them to light			0
' you can listen to more than 200 @entity3 memories , including a clip of @entity1 , at bbc.co.uk / ww1 .			2

@entity1 was dyed from the chemicals handled by her mother @entity54
she *believes* many mothers in munitions factories were the same
now 97 , she said it was seen as *normal* : ' you were tougher in those days ! '
mrs @entity1 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , is one of the last to survive
