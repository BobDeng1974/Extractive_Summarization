the newly - formed branch of @entity1 in the @entity2 has botched its first attempt at a terror attack after jihadists mistook a @entity7 naval ship for a @entity9 aircraft carrier			1
ten heavily armed militants from the terror cell had planned to storm an @entity9 military vessel in @entity14 's sea dock - but found a @entity7 naval frigate in it 's place			1
the men were easily overwhelmed before they could do any damage , investigators said , with three of the militants killed and the remaining seven arrested			2
@entity1 leader @entity20 formally announced the founding of a terror cell in the @entity2 subcontinent two weeks ago in the hope of reviving his ailing extremist group , which has suffered diminishing support since the unprecedented rise of rival @entity29 extremist group @entity28			1
on september 5 , @entity1 militants attempted to storm a @entity9 military vessel here , but found a @entity7 naval frigate in it 's place despite the failure of the terror attack on september 6 , @entity1 in the @entity2 claimed responsibility - adding that the men involved were all former members of the @entity7 navy			1
' the @entity51 officers who were martyred on saturday in the attack on @entity14 were @entity1 members			2
they were trying to attack @entity9 marines and their cronies , ' the group said in a statement released last thursday			0
' the @entity7 military men who died defending enemies of the @entity60 nation ... are cursed with hell ' , they added , apparently still incorrectly believing the attacked vessel had been a @entity64 carrier			0
the craft the group intended to strike may have been the @entity34 @entity33 , believed to have been stationed off the coast of west @entity7 on the day of the incident , having left @entity70 waters the previous day			1
investigators have also denied that the militants were all former members of the @entity7 navy , saying only one of the 10 men was from a naval background			2
rivalry : @entity1 leader @entity20 ( right ) announced the formation of @entity1 in the @entity2 in the hope it would encourage would - be jihadists to join his waning group instead of @entity28 - the terror group led by @entity82 ( left ) that currently control vast swaths of the @entity85 and @entity86 news of @entity1 in the @entity2 's failure to carry out the terror attack was met with mockery by @entity28 sympathizers on social media , who branded the group out of date there were also suggestions that the attack may not even have been carried out by @entity1 at all , and that its increasingly desperate leadership is simply claiming credit for another group 's botched work in the hope it makes them appear more active than they are currently capable of being			1
this line of inquiry appears to be reinforced by the delay of five days between the failed storming and @entity1 's statement claiming responsibility - with the terror group likely waiting to see if the real culprits came forward to admit the embarrassing effort before claiming it for themselves			1
a senior investigator speaking to the @entity114 described the attack as a ' complete failure ' and suggested there may be further arrests relating to the incident			0
' they were well - equipped and came with the intention of taking a ship into their custody but they were caught in the initial stages , ' the unnamed source was quoted as saying			0
the formation of @entity1 in the @entity2 was tailored to counter the flagging image of the group - which has suffered a reversal in fortunes since former leader @entity132 died			1
decline : with an unprecedented wave of extremists pledging allegiance to rival @entity29 extremist group @entity28 ( pictured ) , @entity1 is struggling to recruit new members to its cause and is even suspected of claiming responsibility for failed attacks it did not actually carry out in order to appear more active @entity142 is preparing to join airstrikes on @entity28 in the wake of the murder of @entity148 hostage @entity146 - but will not move until after this week ’s @entity150 referendum , it was claimed today			1
the prime minister is under mounting pressure from mps to act against the @entity28 terror threat but has so far resisted calls to recall @entity156 to authorise a bombing campaign in the @entity158			0
foreign secretary @entity159 will attend a summit in @entity161 today in an attempt to forge a coalition of countries – including @entity166 states – into a military alliance to push back the jihadist advance			0
the prime minister will then attend the @entity170 in @entity171 on tuesday and wednesday where he is expected to outline plans to combat @entity28			0
mps have been told to expect to be recalled on the thursday after the @entity170 session , according to the @entity114			0
it comes after mr @entity142 attacked the ‘ monstrous ’ fanatics responsible for the murder of mr @entity146 this weekend			0
@entity1 members have previously carried out atrocities such as the simultaneous @entity9 embassy truck bombings in @entity181 in 1998 , the september 11 plane attacks in the @entity9 in 2001 , and the @entity184 bombings on july 7 , 2005			0
but the group has lost direction and support since its founder @entity132 was killed by a team of @entity189 in @entity7 in 2011 - not least after subsequent leader @entity20 blacklisted former @entity1 loyalists @entity28 last year and condemning the group for exhibiting unnecessary brutality			1
@entity28 has since gained vast swathes of territory in the @entity158 and attracted thousands of @entity196 extremists to fight under its banner in @entity85 and @entity86 - including at least 500 @entity148			0
earlier this year @entity28 ' leader @entity82 declared the terror group a ' caliphate ' and declared himself a caliph - the spiritual leader of all @entity60 worldwide			2
the group has also carried out the sickening filmed murders of @entity9 journalists @entity206 and @entity208 , and of the @entity148 aid worker @entity146			0
news of @entity1 in the @entity2 's failure to successfully carry out the terror attack has been met with mockery by @entity28 sympathizers			1
extremists took to @entity216 to brand the group ' out of date ' and condemned it for committing terror attacks without ever attempting to seize territory .			2

ten militants stormed @entity7 naval ship after mistaking it for @entity9 vessel
armed group were easily overwhelmed , with three killed and seven arrested
