scathing : commissioner @entity0 claims @entity1 have been a £ 100m waste of money elected crime tsars have been a £ 100million waste of money and spend their time dreaming up gimmicks and clashing with chief constables , one of them admits today			1
@entity0 has confessed that in their first year in charge of police forces , @entity11 have neither made them run better nor made the public safer			1
the @entity15 for the @entity16 said their planning was vague and that many of this new breed of politicians , who earn up to £ 100,000 , had remained generally unknown rather than building public confidence			2
in a withering assessment published to coincide with the first anniversary of the @entity25 ’ election , mr @entity0 gave the flagship law and order reform ‘ four out of ten ’ overall and condemned it as ‘ £ 100 million spent so far on making police accountability less effective ’			2
his comments provoked anger from policing minister @entity30 , who said : ‘ across the country , @entity11 are driving reform and holding their forces to account			2
and it ’s the public who ’ll decide how well they ’ve performed - at the ballot box			0
’ in his ‘ school report ’ , mr @entity0 gave @entity1 three out of ten for cutting crime , claiming the rate is now , at best , flat , and at worst rising again after years of decline			1
the lowest grade , two out of ten , came in the category of public confidence			0
‘ with record low turnout at the election , record levels of hostile publicity , record numbers of investigations into @entity25 and clashes between chief constables and @entity1 etc , there is not much evidence @entity1 have led to more confidence in policing or the governance of policing , ’ said mr @entity0			1
bad choice : @entity62 pcc @entity61 , left , and then youth commissioner @entity63 , right , who stepped down from the role after making offensive comments on @entity66 he gave scores of four out of ten for drawing up budgets and plans , writing : ‘ pccs have had to cope with government funding reductions			1
however , some have not helped the situation by introducing gimmicks and there are serious questions about the sustainability of some budgets			0
’ pccs were brought in across @entity81 and @entity82 last november by the @entity83 to set budgets and decide on strategies while also holding chief constables to account			1
but lack of enthusiasm for the reform among @entity89 meant the polls were held with little publicity , and a record low 15 per cent of voters turned out			0
anger : policing minister @entity30 said @entity1 are ' driving reform ' and ' holding their forces to account ' some keen to stand were barred by strict rules and the @entity97 managed to convince only very few ex-military chiefs and business leaders to stand			0
since the election @entity1 have become embroiled in a series of scandals , including :			0

@entity0 says @entity11 are a waste of money
claims they have neither cut crime , nor *boosted* public confidence
pccs were brought in across @entity81 and @entity82 last november
@entity62 ’s independent crime tsar @entity61 appointed @entity63 as the first ‘ youth commissioner ’ without carrying out basic checks that would have *revealed* that the *teenager* had made offensive comments online .
@entity121 ’s @entity83 pcc @entity119 took two *chauffeur* - driven trips to *meetings* , costing *taxpayers* £ *700* , and when the news was leaked to a local paper , the *whistleblower* was arrested .
pccs in @entity130 and @entity131 forced out their chief constables . in each force only one person applied to take over the top job .
at least a dozen @entity1 handed out well - paid *deputy* roles to friends and allies without advertising them .
four @entity1 have already been investigated by the @entity141 for *alleged* *criminal* *misconduct* . @entity144 ’s @entity143 is *facing* charges , while @entity147 ’s @entity146 is still under investigation .
