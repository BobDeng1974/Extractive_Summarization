by @entity0 published : 14:59 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 15:03 est , 20 december 2012 thrill - seeker : @entity2 drowned after he jumped 100 feet into the sea a @entity5 tourist drowned after he jumped up to 100 feet from a cliff face into the sea			1
@entity2 , 25 , who was nicknamed captain @entity8 , had travelled with his best friend to @entity11 in june to try free climbing craze , @entity13			1
tragedy struck when mr @entity2 from @entity15 in @entity16 , struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks			1
after talking to his friend , @entity22 , 25 , the @entity21 graduate decided the best option was for him to swim to a nearby cave			1
however , he got into difficulties and was found lying face down and lifeless in the water by coastguards			1
he was pronounced dead at the scene after attempts to resuscitate him failed			0
mr @entity2 , who had been working in @entity31 as a climbing instructor , and was due to be best man at mr @entity22 ’s wedding wanted to be the first of the two friends to free climb on the first day of their holiday			1
mr @entity22 who is a trained outdoor climber said the climbing routes they were hoping to complete on the holiday were quite low on the grading spectrum			1
he told the @entity44 inquest : ‘ this climb was around a 6a grade and we were both able to climb grades @entity48 and @entity50 - the route was well within our comfort rate			0
we were deliberately cautious since we had never done it before			0
‘ when we climbed together , we were very close in ability - but in terms of strength i would have been slightly higher			0
however what he lacked in strength , he more than beat me in confidence , in terms of going for it			0
’ tragedy : after mr @entity2 allowed himself to fall up to 100 feet , he struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks on examining the crag , they decided they would need rope to help aide them to a ledge located further down			1
mr @entity22 said : ‘ @entity73 wanted to go first ; he was really , really excited about it and was really enthusiastic			0
he had a lot of confidence in climbing so he wanted to go for it			0
’ the hearing was told @entity73 removed his climbing shoes off , wedged them into a gap where the ropes were attached to the rock , and jumped			2
cautious : mr @entity2 and his friend chose climbing routhes that were well within their comfort rate			1
after he landed in the water , the pair decided it best he swim round the cliff to a nearby cave mr @entity22 said there were three ropes - two in the form of a ladder - secured to the rock which dropped to the water to enable easy access back up on to the rock			1
as he struggled with the ropes , mr @entity22 said : ‘ he was a little bit frustrated , but he was still chatty and chirpy			2
‘ his nickname at university was captain @entity8 because he was very long in the body and when he used to climb his backside would stick out - and it was - he was finding it difficult to get into an upright position on the rope			2
’ unclear : it is not known exactly how mr @entity2 died as when he began swimming he moved out of sight of his friend after the pair , who did not have phones on them , decided that it would be best for @entity73 to swim round the cliff , mr @entity22 made his way along the cliff top to the cave which was around 200 feet away			1
on the way he saw a @entity123 couple and told them to alert the emergency services			0
when he got to the cave , there was no sign of mr @entity2			1
he said : ‘ he did n't appear			0
it should n't have taken him very long ’			0
deep water soloing is a relatively new style of climbing but it is believed to have originated in the late 1960s or early 1970s in @entity133 , @entity134 or @entity11			1
the activity involves climbing on sea cliffs with no ropes and only climbing shoes and chalk as aides – but at high tide so the water cushions climbers from serious injury			2
normally a dinghy is used to pick up the fallen climber as a fall from a taller route can still knock the climber out , causing them to drown			2
the practise is sometimes named ‘ @entity13 ’ , which , when translated literally from @entity151 into @entity152 , means ‘ @entity154 ’			0
recording a verdict of accidental death coroner @entity156 said : ‘ @entity73 has been described as a very competent and confident climber			2
from his friend 's evidence , we 've heard that they had gone on holiday with the intention of deep water soloing			1
‘ they had prepared for that - they did n't go in blindly			0
both he and @entity168 prepared as much as they could for this			0
we 've heard that @entity73 jumped into the water and seemed to be enjoying swimming in the water			1
‘ he struggled to get out of the water , notwithstanding the fact that the ropes were in the water			1
his friend created a rope using slings			1
he dropped them into the water			2
@entity73 appeared to find them easier to use but was still struggling			0
‘ @entity73 dropped back into the water and the two of them reached the decision that @entity73 would swim to a spot about 50 - 70 metres away to a cave which would allow @entity73 easier access out of the water			1
‘ this was not a reckless decision by @entity73 - the sea appeared calm , @entity73 felt confident swimming in the water			2
‘ at that point he started swimming to the cave knowing exactly where he was swimming to on his back			2
‘ his friends ascended back up the rock and went to the cave			0
@entity202 was then out of sight , so it 's unclear what happened			0
