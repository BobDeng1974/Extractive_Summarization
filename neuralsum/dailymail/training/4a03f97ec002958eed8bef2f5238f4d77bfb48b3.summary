by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 9 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:08 est , 10 december 2013 close : @entity5 , with his daughter @entity3 , had @entity6 's for 17 years of his life when we ca n’t put a name to a familiar face , or we lose our keys , most of us will see it as nothing more than a minor irritation			1
but for @entity17 , seemingly trivial moments of forgetfulness bear a sinister warning of the illness that killed her beloved father			1
after watching @entity5 battle @entity6 for 17 years before his death aged 85 in february last year , she is terrified of following in his footsteps			1
the @entity26 host has described how the pain of watching her father ‘ lose his identity ’ to dementia was too much to bear – and she would be devastated if the same thing happened to her or her husband , @entity34 reader @entity33			1
the 53 - year - old has spoken of her fears for the first time to help raise awareness of the @entity40 ’s helpline , which will be under pressure from increased demand during the festive season			1
she said : ‘ i saw the detrition of my father and it is something which worries me			1
i worry that i have dementia in the family and one day i may get it			1
‘ i mean , every time you mislay your car keys or struggle to remember somebody ’s name , you think , “ @entity54 , here we go ”			0
me , my mum and my sister joke about it but obviously it is in the back of our minds and it is a worry			0
deep down there is always that fear			0
‘ i think the thing i fear most about dementia is losing my dignity and people not understanding you			2
‘ i hope it never happens to me and @entity33			0
when i saw my parents , they had been married many years , and mum started to believe he did n’t recognise her			2
love : @entity3 and her husband @entity33 have an 11 - year - old son called @entity75 ‘ it absolutely broke my heart to see that and i would hope it never happens to us for that reason alone			2
’ however , miss @entity17 said she still does n’t believe in using technology to find out if she ’s at risk of developing the disease			0
‘ i believe there are blood tests that you can undergo to find out if you are going to get it but i do n’t think i would want to know , ’ said @entity85 , who has an 11 - year - old son called @entity75 with @entity33 , 54			1
‘ because i know the illness ca n’t be cured , i know there is no happy ending and why would you want to know when there is no preventative ? it is n’t like there is someone to say if you drink this syrup every day then you wo n’t get @entity6 ’s , so i do n’t see the point in being told now			0
fear : @entity3 , who hosts this morning with her husband , says she does n't want to know what lies ahead ‘ i know what my life would be , and it is enough to have seen someone go through it than to be burdened with the knowledge it is going to happen to you too			1
’ the @entity40 ’s national dementia helpline receives 38,000 calls annually , with a higher volume during @entity115 when families are reunited			2
miss @entity17 is also helping the @entity118 campaign , which provides support to carers and the families of sufferers			0
the scheme helps to teach patients ’ loved - ones how to communicate with them and explains the effects of the illness			0
for confidential advice , information and support , call @entity40 's @entity130 on 0300 222 11 22			0
the service is open monday to friday and at weekends , with trained advisers who understand the needs of people affected by dementia			2
you can also email enquiries to @entity138			0
