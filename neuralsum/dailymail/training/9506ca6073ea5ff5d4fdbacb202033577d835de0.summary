@entity0 loved ones of the deceased looking for a unique take on the classic funeral service are increasingly taking advantage of showmen pallbearers who march , dance and twirl the casket toward its final resting place			1
these lively professionals lend a decided different air to the traditionally somber ceremony , but they could come at a steep price			0
while some funeral homes offer the service , which is more common in the @entity16 , free with a funeral , others charge as much as $ 1,400 a show			1

' then they accompany the hearse , walking			0
then , depending on the service , they may do the same thing at the cemetery , shoulder the casket to the grave			2
