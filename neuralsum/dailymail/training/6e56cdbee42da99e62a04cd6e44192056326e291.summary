by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 13:23 est , 28 december 2012 @entity1 has repaired flood damage at its nuclear test facility and could conduct a quick atomic explosion if it chose - and could trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks			1
but water streaming out of a test tunnel may cause problems at the site , analysis of recent satellite photos has found			1
leaders in @entity13 and around the world are braced for the possibility that if punished for a successful long - range rocket launch on december 12 , that the @entity18 considers a cover for a banned ballistic missile test , @entity1 's next step might be its third nuclear test			1
this satellite image taken nov. 19 , 2012 by @entity23 shows the entrance area of the @entity25 in @entity1 , where experts suspect @entity27 will conduct its next detonation			1
analysts claim tyre tracks now run from the bypass road to the southern area support buildings , the new bridge appears to be wider than before and the tent cover has been raised with the snowfall			0
rocket and nuclear tests unnerve @entity13 and its allies because each new success puts @entity1 scientists another step closer to perfecting a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile that could hit the mainland @entity45			1
@entity1 leader @entity46 , pictured			2
it is feared his next step might be a third nuclear test after a test facility was repaired another nuclear test , which @entity1 's @entity52 hinted at on the day of the rocket launch , would fit a pattern			1
@entity27 conducted its first and second atomic explosions , in 2006 and 2009 , weeks after receiving @entity57 condemnation and sanctions for similar long - range rocket launches			0
@entity1 is thought to have enough plutonium for a handful of crude atomic bombs , and unveiled a uranium enrichment facility in 2010 , but it must continue to conduct tests to master the miniaturisation technology crucial for a true nuclear weapons program			1
' with an additional nuclear test , @entity1 could advance their ability to eventually deploy a nuclear weapon on a long - range missile , ' said @entity72 , executive director of the nongovernment @entity72			1
analysts caution that only so much can be determined from satellite imagery , and it 's very difficult to fully discern @entity1 's plans			1
this is especially true for nuclear test preparations , which are often done deep within a mountain			1
@entity1 , for instance , took many by surprise when it launched its rocket this month only several days after announcing technical problems			2
although there 's no sign of an imminent nuclear test , @entity45 and @entity87 officials worry that @entity27 could conduct one at any time			1
analysis of @entity93 and @entity23 satellite photos from december 13 and earlier , provided to @entity95 by @entity96 , the website for the @entity45 - @entity98 at @entity99 , said scientists are ' determined to maintain a state of readiness ' at the @entity25 after repairing flood damage			2
this satellite image taken on december 2 shows the traffic flow pattern at the @entity25 in @entity1			2
the @entity92 says the road is dark where movement has melted the snow , and the traffic appears limited to the bypass road , the tunnel entrance and the two southern area support buildings			0
the nuclear speculation comes as @entity87 's conservative president - elect , @entity113 , prepares to take office in february , and as young @entity1 leader @entity46 marks his one - year anniversary as supreme commander			1
@entity46 has consolidated power since taking over after his father , @entity118 , died dec. 17 , 2011 , and the rocket launch is seen as a major internal political and popular boost for the 20 - something leader			0
some analysts , however , question whether @entity46 will risk international , and especially @entity123 , wrath and sure sanctions by quickly conducting a nuclear test			1
the election in @entity87 and @entity131 's re-election to a second term as @entity45 president could prompt @entity1 to try more diplomacy than military options , some believe			2
@entity136 , an analyst at the @entity137 , a private think tank in @entity138			0
' i think we 'll see @entity1 more focused on economic revival than on nuclear testing next year			2
' the 38 @entity96 analysis said the @entity96 ' may be able to trigger a detonation in as little as two weeks , once a political decision is made to move forward			1
' but the report by @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 also said it was unclear whether water seepage from a tunnel entrance at the site was under control			0
@entity155 could hurt a nuclear device and the sensors needed to monitor a test			2
the analysis also identified what it called a previously unidentified structure that could be meant to protect sensitive equipment from bad weather			0
' we do n't have a crystal ball that will tell us when the @entity96 will conduct its third nuclear test , ' said @entity167 , a former @entity168 official and now editor of @entity96			1
' but events over the next few months , such as the @entity18 reaction to @entity27 's missile test and the @entity96 's unfolding policy toward the new @entity87 government , may at least provide us with some clues			2
' another unknown is how @entity123 , the @entity96 's only major ally , would respond to calls for tighter sanctions			0
@entity13 views more pressure from @entity180 as pivotal if diplomatic pressure is going to force change in @entity27			0
even if @entity180 signs on to @entity18 punishment if the @entity96 conducts a test , there may be less hurt for @entity27 than @entity13 wants			0
the impact of tougher sanctions would be ' a drop in the bucket compared with the tidal wave of @entity123 - @entity1 trade ' that has risen sharply since 2008 , even as inter-korean trade has remained flat , said @entity194 , a @entity1 expert at the @entity195			0
trade figures show @entity1 's deepening dependence on @entity123			1
@entity27 's trade with @entity180 surged more than 60 percent last year , reaching $ 5.63 billion , according to @entity87 's @entity199			0
@entity123 accounted for 70 percent of @entity1 's annual trade in 2011 , up from 57 percent in 2010			1
@entity1 's 2006 nuclear test had an estimated explosive yield of 1 kiloton			1
the @entity204 estimated in 2011 that the @entity96 's test on may 25 , 2009 , which followed @entity18 condemnation of an april long - range rocket launch , had a minimum yield of 5.7 kilotons			0
the atomic bomb that hit @entity210 at the end of @entity212 was about 21 kilotons			0
both @entity1 tests used plutonium for fissile material			0
without at least one more successful plutonium test , it 's unlikely that @entity27 could have confidence in a miniaturized plutonium design , according to an august paper by @entity221 of @entity204 and @entity222 of @entity223			0
@entity1 's small plutonium stockpile is sufficient for four to eight bombs , they wrote , but it may be willing to sacrifice some if it can augment information from the previous tests			1
@entity221 and @entity222 predicted that @entity27 may simultaneously test both plutonium and highly enriched uranium devices			0
a uranium test would worry the international community even more , as it would confirm that @entity1 , which would need months to restart its shuttered plutonium reactor , has an alternative source of fissile material based on uranium enrichment			2
@entity1 unveiled a previously secret uranium enrichment plant in november 2010			0
' whether and when @entity1 conducts another nuclear test will depend on how high a political cost @entity27 is willing to bear , ' mr @entity221 and mr @entity222 wrote			1
another test would also undermine @entity27 's assertion that its long - range rocket launches are for a peaceful space program and not what outsiders see as the development of ballistic missiles that could eventually deliver nuclear weapons			2
on the same day as this month 's rocket launch , an unidentified @entity250 spokesman told state media that a hostile @entity45 response to a failed launch in april of this year had forced @entity27 ' to re-examine the nuclear issue as a whole			0
the statement was a clear threat to detonate a nuclear device ahead of any @entity57 action , said @entity261 , an analyst at the state - run @entity262 in @entity138 .			0

*discovery* of repair comes from an analysis of satellite images
world leaders fear that @entity1 's may be *plotting* its third nuclear test
@entity272 could trigger detonation in just two weeks
