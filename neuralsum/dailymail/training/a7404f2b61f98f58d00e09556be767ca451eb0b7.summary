but most of their staggering collection are family pets , with some of them living in their children 's bedrooms			0
the @entity63 hope to open up a small zoo nearby , which will mainly be made up of rescued animals			1
mr @entity38 and his wife , 32 , met when they were both lab technicians 12 years ago and instantly bonded over their shared love of animals			2
since moving in together they have filled every nook and cranny of their detached house and garden with a different animal , including pigs , insects , a hedgehog and a raccoon			0

it rubbed off on me			0
' i bought my first cornsnake at 11 and my collection grew from there , but i never set out to get 145 pets			0
' we have so many because we are a rescue sanctuary for exotic animals , which there are not many of			0
' the couple have more than 30 snakes , including the @entity20 constrictors , five baby pythons and cornsnakes that live in the garage along with the crocodile , monitor lizard and a shed - load of creepy crawlies			2
inside the house , every room , apart from the animal - free the living room , is jam - packed with tanks and cages from floor to ceiling			0

mr @entity38 has collected pets since he was 11 and wants to set up a zoo near the family home the @entity63 have to clean the house once a day to stop the house from smelling , which was an impossible task on the one occasion that the skunks sprayed their bedroom their house may look normal from the outside , but the @entity38 family home houses 145 creatures ' it 's nothing unusual for [ the children ] to see me coming home with a raccoon or a crocodile , ' said mr @entity38			1
the animal - mad family clean the house and gardens every day so the smell never gets too pungent , but the skunks , which have their own toilet , once sprayed in the bedroom , leaving an acrid stench for days			1
unsurprisingly , looking after so many animals can be expensive , with the food bill reaching £ 100 a month and mr @entity38 striking a deal with a local greengrocer to cut down the cost			2
' we also have to fork out about £ 250 a month for heating as many of the animals require a constant heat source , ' mr @entity38 said			2
' we have a number of scorpions and the shiny burrowing scorpion is always trying to sting me			0
' and the boa constrictor is not the friendliest - but we would n't swap any of them for the world			0
