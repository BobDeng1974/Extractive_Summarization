by @entity1 reporter published : 02:57 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 19:43 est , 29 march 2013 a @entity3 woman could be locked up for a year in an @entity5 jail for having a glass of wine with a married man			1
the ex-pat teacher , whose first name is believed to be @entity11 , says she was introduced to the @entity13 man by a male colleague			1
he is understood to have eaten with the pair but then left them alone at the man ’s house – where the woman was arrested			2
modern : but a @entity3 woman in @entity5 has appeared in court for socialising with a married man over lunch and a glass of wine she has now appeared in court in the strict @entity29 emirate , charged with being alone in the company of a man other than her husband or a close relative , and drinking alcohol without a licence			1
the court heard that the @entity13 threw his wife out of their home last week after an argument			2
after she complained to police about her husband ’s behaviour , officers visited him the next day and found him enjoying an after - lunch glass of wine with the @entity3 woman , who has not been officially named			2
the man ’s wife insisted that officials press charges when she was told that her husband had been drinking with another woman			0
if found guilty under the country ’s strict legislation , which is influenced by @entity58 ’s sharia law , the teacher could be imprisoned for as long as 12 months			0
traditional : the @entity59 is still governed by sharia - inspired law police arrested the @entity3 teacher and her host for being alone together and drinking alcohol illegally			0
' she is looking at anything between a month in jail or a year for being alone with a man who is not her husband , ' a @entity59 legal expert told the @entity71 ' as in so many alcohol cases , it only becomes a problem if someone makes a complaint to the police and they are obliged to act			0
' the case highlights the paradoxical nature of life in the @entity59 , which has a reputation as the party capital of the @entity85 despite its strict @entity58 culture			0
the @entity13 man will not be punished for being with the @entity88 , as it is not a crime for men to socialise with women , but has been detained on a separate drugs charge .			1
