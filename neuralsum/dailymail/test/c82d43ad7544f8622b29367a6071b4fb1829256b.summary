a catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two @entity3 hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months			1
independent investigators were called into @entity9 after the deaths of four babies and two mothers , and @entity13 after the deaths of another three babies and one mother			1
@entity17 , 35 , died at @entity18 48 hours after giving birth in april this year , while newborn @entity20 died at the same hospital in june after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth			1
@entity17 , 35 , ( left with son @entity25 ) died 48 hours after giving birth at @entity18 in june last year			1
@entity20 ( right ) died from at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb a summary of the investigation , which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now , has been seen by @entity34 and found ' notable absence of clinical leadership ' in the maternity wards , and a ' failure to adequately plan care ' in a number of cases			1
a team of independent investigators also found risk management was ' below standard ' in some cases - though there were no apparent ' deficiencies in care ' in the deaths of the three mothers			1
the report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese , which can lead to complications , but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed			2
officials also criticised the hospital 's own investigations , saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified , opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up , and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure			2
all of the deaths are believed to have occurred between december 2013 , and july last year			0
in one case mother @entity17 , 35 , also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son @entity25 in june this year			1
in another case newborn @entity20 died from head injuries in april after medics forced him back into the womb during birth			1
doctors had also tried and failed to remove him from the womb five times using forceps , despite national guidelines only recommending three attempts			0
while his death was not included in the review , staff at @entity79 , which controls the two hospitals , have asked investigators to look into it			0
@entity85 , the father of @entity20 , said : ' ten deaths in eight months is sickening			1
but i 'm not surprised			0
independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at @entity18 following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months the report , which also looked into the deaths of three babies and another mother at @entity13 , found that national guidelines for treating obese mothers were also not followed ' the standard of care we received during and after @entity20 died gives me zero confidence in their organisation , structure and accountability			1
' i 'm angry we were not informed [ about the report ] , even if out of courtesy			0
it feels like they 're trying to cover each other 's backs			0
' but i 'm fully behind any action that makes sure this sort of thing is prevented in the future			0
' @entity119 is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings			0
they include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management , making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors			2
@entity133 's new maternity unit , children 's unit and neonatal intensive care unit opened in december 2012			1
the £ 44m facility became one of three specialist @entity140 neonatal centres as part of a controversial £ 120m shake - up which saw maternity units shut in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			2
@entity148 , chief nurse at @entity149 , said : ' @entity150 is always keen to learn and to improve care			0
we commissioned a review by experts from outside the @entity79 to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals			0
' we are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients			0
' we deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals , but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this			2
' a spokeswoman for the @entity176 , the health regulator , said : ' @entity176 is aware that @entity79 has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust , @entity181 and local @entity182 regarding the review findings			0
