by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:46 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 20:28 est , 14 november 2012 for many passengers , the dream is to board a plane and turn left into business class			2
but a dramatic tv documentary appears to have taken away some of the attraction			2
on the @entity11 show , scientists crashed a @entity13 727 carrying test dummies into the @entity15 desert			1
online travel agent @entity40 said more than 400 customers had requested seats at the back of a plane since the programme aired			1
spokesman @entity46 said : ‘ the programme has certainly had an effect on those who watched it as we ’ve seen by the recent enquiries from customers panicking about where they ’d be sat on the plane			0
‘ obviously , that ’s ultimately something you arrange through the airline itself , or at the check - in desk			0
' many airlines do n’t have designated seats and it just depends on when you get on the plane			0
’ brace position : the jet , which can carry up to 170 passengers , contained only crash - test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence mr @entity46 added : ‘ people should remember that plane crashes are rare and try not to worry about where they are sat - instead trying to focus on their exciting holiday ahead			2
’ the company also said it had 50 calls from passengers worried about being given seat @entity78			0
in the test crash , this seat was catapulted 500ft from the plane , which would have meant certain death for an occupant			0
it also said there had been a 63 per cent drop in requests for first - class travel			1
on the programme , scientists simulated the most common type of aviation accident – a forced landing			0
selection : in a macabre twist to the show last month , people logged into @entity98 to ' check - in online ' and chose where they would have sat on the flight a pilot flew the 727 before parachuting out			1
scientists then crashed the plane by remote control			2
experts used sensors , cameras and dummies with ‘ breakable bones ’ to assess the impact on the plane and passengers			0
in a macabre twist to the show last month , people logged into @entity98 to ' check - in online ' and chose where they would have sat on the flight			1
after the terrifying collision , which ripped off the front of the jet in a cloud of sand , debris and twisted metal , they found out if they had died or survived			1
the programme ’s conclusion was that despite having the best seats and service on the plane , being in first or business class makes you less likely to survive a crash landing			0
the experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash - worthiness of the aircraft 's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body			1
coming down : the experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash - worthiness of the aircraft 's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on the human body smash : a pilot had earlier flown the jet out to the @entity15 desert and jumped out before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground it was the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane was crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment			1
the last time was in 1984 when @entity158 teamed up with the @entity159 to crash a @entity13 720 into the @entity160 in @entity161			2
@entity162 , executive producer of the documentary , said before it aired : ' we felt the time was right to do it again			0
' it has never been safer to fly , but we want to use this as an opportunity to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does occur			0
’ video : watch the @entity177 crash land in @entity11 's documentary @entity178			1

@entity11 's @entity178 showed @entity13 727 *deliberately* crashed
experiment in @entity15 found people at front had worst survival chance
travel agency gets 400 requests about seating in month since show
