friends using @entity1 could soon send each other money in a very similar way to how they currently exchange photos within private messages			1
this rumour is based on screenshots taken by a @entity9 computer science student who uncovered what he believes is @entity12 ’s next move to make its stand - alone messaging service more popular			1
the payment options appear to let users send money in the same way they send files , with the addition of in - app pin code to boost security			1
@entity23 , a student at @entity24 in @entity25 , used an @entity27 tool called @entity28 on an @entity29 to explore the ‘ forthcoming ’ feature , which has yet to be confirmed by @entity12 , @entity22 reported			1
he said users will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message , but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free , or whether users will have to pay a charge for the convenience			1
if the feature is confirmed , it may explain why @entity12 recently appointed @entity42 – the former president of @entity43 – as the new head of @entity45			1
a messenger payment service would go head - to - head with @entity43 , as well as other peer - to - peer payment systems			2
it would also make @entity12 ’s offering stand out from other popular messaging apps such as @entity51			2
more than messages ? the student who used the payment system says users of @entity45 ( logo pictured ) will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free , or whether users will have to pay a charge in july , @entity12 ’s ceo @entity65 hinted that a payment service will be added to the social network , saying : ‘ over time there will be some overlap between [ messenger ] and payments			1
a payment service would go head - to - head with other peer - to - peer payment systems			0
a screenshot of the current messenger is pictured ‘ the payments piece will be a part of what will help drive the overall success and help people share with each other and interact with businesses			0
’ however , he warned at the time that there was a lot of work for @entity12 to do and that the company would ‘ take the time to do this , ’ possibly over several years			2
security researcher @entity91 first came across ‘ evidence ’ of the rumoured payment system last month , but mr @entity23 has gone a step further by turning it on and taking screenshots of the feature			1
‘ with @entity12 messenger , you attach money just like you attach a photo or a location			1
you do n't even have to link a bank account ! ’ mr @entity23 tweeted			0
he continued that users can press a button to make a payment , entering the amount of money they want to send			1
the transaction is not posted to a user ’s @entity109 and is kept private			0
explaining how it works , mr @entity23 said the system uses ‘ some magical means ’ to look up the bank account number of a recipient , before depositing the chosen sum of money			2
the student said the system only works with debit cards – not credit cards or bank accounts – which is possibly because this type of payment is the cheapest to process			2
he thinks each transaction would cost @entity12 up to $ 0.50 , but in its current form , it looks as if the feature is free to users			1
a note in the code suggests that while the system is initially being built to make payments from one friend to another , there is an intention to support group payments in time			2
mr @entity23 believes that @entity12 will roll out the feature in the @entity9 over the next few months , but concedes that it could take much longer			1
financial tech expert @entity138 shared his vision for the future of banking with @entity143			0
in the future , banks could rely on social networks in a way their customers have never seen before			0
for example , as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority , banks could ask their clients for permission to access them			0
according to @entity138 , cards will soon disappear , to be replaced with mobile phones used to tap against readers to pay for goods and services			0
but even that technology wo n’t last long , @entity138 continued			0
instead , banks will rely on finger scanners and retina readers to process transactions			0
@entity138 also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops , cafes and supermarkets			0
and he believes that stripping away card systems in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queues .			0
