by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 ’s defensive concerns could deepen after it emerged that the @entity5 are yet to sign off on @entity7 ’s transfer , partly because of @entity9 ’s involvement with funding group @entity10			1
@entity7 moved to @entity11 for £ 16million eight days ago but has not yet played for @entity12			0
it had been thought that obtaining a work permit was the only delay in his registration being ratified but @entity18 understands that the @entity5 are still processing the paperwork associated with @entity10 ’s claim to 75 per cent of the transfer fee			1
the delay would need to be overcome by 12pm on friday if @entity7 is to be eligible for the important encounter with @entity23 at @entity24 on saturday afternoon			1
it is uncertain whether that will prove the case			0
move : @entity7 was unveiled by @entity11 last week after his £ 16m move from @entity9 theatre of dreams : @entity7 could make his debut against @entity23 if the @entity5 ratify his transfer when @entity7 was bought by @entity9 from @entity32 for £ 3.5m in 2012 @entity10 are understood to have loaned the @entity34 club most of the money			1
in return the investment fund would receive 75 per cent of any future transfer fee or be repaid in full at a set interest rate – as with a lending bank			1
but a row between @entity9 ’s new president @entity42 and @entity10 broke out when he discovered the arrangement and claimed the club were being put under pressure to sell @entity45 to @entity11			2
@entity10 insisted this was never the case but in the end the @entity48 international did switch to @entity51			2
@entity9 received £ 8m immediately , with two further instalments of £ 4m due but @entity18 understands @entity10 have yet to receive a single penny and are considering legal action that could end up in court			2
@entity11 are not implicated in this in any shape and @entity10 ’s only concern is holding @entity9 to the contract the club signed in 2012			0
in training : @entity11 boss @entity3 speaks to his new signing during training that wrangle in itself is not holding up the @entity5 ’s legal team but any transfer involving third - party entities is looked at with great care after the @entity70 affair			0
on a similar basis it took time for deals to be completed for @entity75 ’s @entity74 and @entity77 ’s @entity76 earlier in the window as guarantees on the ownership of their economic rights were sought			0
once the @entity5 are satisfied with the issues around @entity7 he will be granted permission to play – but until then it leaves @entity12 without one of his key signings and a defensive headache .			0
