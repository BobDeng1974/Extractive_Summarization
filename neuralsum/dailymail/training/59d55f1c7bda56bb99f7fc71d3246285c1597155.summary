by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 19:10 est , 7 march 2014 @entity3 refuge : @entity4 at his bar in the holiday island of @entity7 a former detective facing investigation over alleged corruption in the @entity13 inquiry has boasted ‘ they ’ll never lay a finger on me ’ , it was claimed yesterday			1
@entity4 has run the @entity18 restaurant in the @entity3 holiday island of @entity7 for 15 years since taking early retirement from the @entity21			1
the ex-detective sergeant also owns a flat above the restaurant and a nearby villa with a pool two minutes from the beach , as well as a holiday home in @entity30 , locals say			2
@entity4 is expected to be questioned by police over claims he helped shield @entity13 ’s killers following a damning official report into the teenager ’s murder by barrister @entity37			1
but the @entity38 - born 68 - year - old , who was nicknamed @entity40 for ‘ @entity41 ’ during his time on the @entity21 , has told fellow expats in @entity7 he has no fears about his past			1
one neighbour said : ‘ he is very sure of himself and very cocky			2
he struts around like he runs the island			2
he really fancies himself as the big man			2
‘ people know about his history with the @entity13 case and have confronted him			1
he tells them , “ they ’ll never lay a finger on me			2
i ’ve done nothing wrong			0
they ’ve got nothing to do me for ”			0
‘ he has a few friends but many people find him too overbearing , though people are anxious about speaking out because they think he is well connected			0
’ @entity4 , a father of two , moved to @entity7 with @entity60 , his wife of 45 years , from their home in @entity62			1
he has recently tried to sell the smugglers for £ 290,000 , saying he wants to return to the @entity64 to spend time with his grandchildren			0
but without any takers , he has told locals he plans to reopen at the start of the holiday season in may			0
a recent picture from the restaurant ’s @entity72 page shows him dressed in an apparent @entity75 costume with white facepaint and green hair			0
he also runs an ‘ unofficial ’ taxi service with his friend ’s van , which has infuriated the local cab firms , locals said			0
ghouls ¿ gallery : @entity4 and friends pose in @entity75 make up for picture posted on @entity72 @entity4 , who has previously denied sabotaging the @entity13 investigation , was believed to be away last night and could not be reached for comment			1
one local said @entity4 has told him that by the time he joined the investigation into @entity13 ’s murder – a few days after the teenager had been stabbed to death in the street by a gang – most of the evidence had already been corrupted			1
@entity98 dismissed renewed corruption claims against @entity100 two years ago , although in 2006 former @entity21 assistant commissioner @entity101 told a @entity103 programme about the @entity13 case that he had no doubt that @entity4 was corrupt			1
mr @entity107 ’s bombshell report on thursday said evidence suggests that @entity4 acted corruptly during the murder inquiry			1
the @entity110 will investigate claims that @entity4 had a corrupt relationship with @entity113 , during the early stages of the investigation			1
@entity113 ’s son @entity116 was one of the original @entity13 suspects and was finally jailed for the murder in 2012			2
@entity4 is expected to face questioning following @entity107 's ( left ) review into the @entity13 case @entity4 could be questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office or perverting the cause of justice – both of which carry heavy jail terms – by @entity64 ’s new crime fighting force			1
the smugglers , in the sleepy fishing village of @entity131 on @entity7 ’s south coast , is highly rated by users on the @entity135 website for its food – cooked by mrs @entity137 – friendliness and hospitality , although some locals claim it is cliquey , with non-regulars made to feel unwelcome			0
an owner of the neighbouring cafe claimed when he opened up four years ago @entity4 ‘ welcomed ’ him by mocking him for having a cafe while he owned a restaurant			2
‘ he made me feel very small			0
it ’s ironic , because he ’s no good at serving tables at all and there are many complaints			0
he told me he only runs the restaurant to make a bit of spending money so he can go on lots of holidays during the winter			0
’ last year the @entity157 put the restaurant up for sale			0
an advert read : ‘ we have decided to retire home to the @entity64 to spend time with our families and enjoy our grandchildren			0

he is expected to face questioning by @entity21 following police corruption claims
but expat , 68 , boasted to neighbours he has no fears about his past
