by @entity0 published : 16:46 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 15:20 est , 24 april 2013 disgraced former congressman @entity1 running for mayor of @entity3 , and he 's back on @entity4 , the social networking portal that destroyed his national political career			1
and @entity7 is not amused			0
' @entity8 @ anthonyweiner has returned to twitter , ' @entity7 warned in a tweet on tuesday			1
' parents of all underage girls should block him immediately ! ' in a second zinger , the @entity14 star and real estate mogul asked the question that 's now on @entity3 ' minds : ' will @ anthonyweiner be fully clothed in his mayoral ads ? ' the @entity7 has never been accused of keeping his thoughts to himself , and @entity21 could be a casualty of the @entity14 's massive reach on @entity4 a contrite @entity21 announced his resignation from @entity25 on june 16 , 2011 following an earlier press conference where he admitted sextng a series of women over three years this is n't the first time @entity7 has tweeted his outrage at @entity21 's re-entry into politics at a high level			1
' sexual pervert @entity21 has zero business holding public office , ' he tweeted two weeks ago			0
in july 2012 when @entity21 popped out from hiding to test the mayoral waters , @entity7 warned that ' he 's a sexual pervert & they can never be healed			1
' he also advised @entity41 , @entity21 's wife , that she ' should drop him before it happens again			1
' the ' it ' is a reference to the scandal that plummeted @entity21 from the heights of national political popularity after he tweeted suggestive private messages to several young women not named @entity41			2
the two had been married for less than a year when the scandal developed			0
@entity7 resumed his tweet - beating of @entity21 on tuesday , taking jabs at his mayoral aspirations if @entity21 were to go bare - chested in his ads , @entity7 would certainly yell , ' you 're fired ! ' - but few @entity3 voters say they plan to give him a chance @entity21 's exit from the political stage began when one tweet was found to contain a photograph of his erect penis straining against his underwear			1
he mistakenly sent it as a public tweet instead of a private message , showing millions of @entity67 what he was doing in his spare time and , some said , from his @entity72 office			0
another photo unveiled later showed a bare - chested @entity21 photographing himself in front of a mirror			2
@entity21 claimed for weeks that his @entity4 account had been hacked , but he was dogged all the way by conservative media raconteur @entity78 , who demanded his resignation daily and insisted that his deception made him unfit for office			0
the @entity83 ultimately stepped down from the @entity84 in june 2011 after serving nearly seven terms , offering an apology to his constituents - and to @entity78 personally			0
he had remained largely out of the public eye since then			0
the tweet heard ' round the world showed @entity21 's genitals , and was meant for a female admirer , but he mistakenly sent it as a message that the world could see			1
the bare - chested selfie emerged later when a woman who shared it with @entity78 's website said @entity21 emailed it to her in the months following his resignation , the disgraced former congressman stayed out of the public eye , appearing only a few times on the street of @entity3 with his wife , @entity41 , and their son @entity106 in a circus - like 2011 press conference , @entity21 admitted that he had ' exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years			1
' those women included the pornographic actress @entity115 , a @entity117 blackjack dealer , and a 26 - year - old single mother from @entity119			0
@entity78 died tragically of a heart attack the following february			0
@entity21 has kept his tweeting to a minimum since rejoining the network under a new handle - @ anthonyweiner instead of @entity125			2
the most recent of his only three tweets advocates that @entity3 employees who use tobacco should be forced to pay higher health insurance premiums than their nonsmoking colleagues			2
a representative for @entity7 did n't respond to an email seeking comment			0
@entity21 's attorney and representative also did n't return a phone call			1
in his darkest days , constituents were echoing calls for his resignation			0
this sign , hoisted outside a car in front of @entity21 's ueens , @entity3 home , read , ' @entity145 ? resign now ! ' @entity7 , shown in the april 2013 all star @entity14 broadcast , may have the last laugh since his @entity4 account , @ @entity149 , reaches more than 2.1 million readers but the former congressman wil have an uphill climb if he wants to succeed mayor @entity153			1
a recent poll showed that just 16 per cent of @entity3 would vote for him , compared to 25 per cent support for city council speaker @entity156			1
a separate poll indicated that more than half of registered @entity159 would not even consider voting for him			0
in july 2012 , @entity7 tweeter that when he was ' in his prime , i predicted that @ @entity163 would never be mayor & i was right for all of the wrong reasons			2

shamed former seven - term congressman will run for @entity3 mayor despite sexting scandal that *torpedoed* his @entity171 career
@entity7 has warned @entity21 's wife to leave him ' before it happens again '
recent polls show @entity21 with just 16 per cent support among likely voters
