consequences : the photographer , who is based in @entity89 , @entity8 , has said that while he does not remember the night of the disaster 27 years ago , he has witnessed the consequences of the tragedy throughout his life tragedy : radioactive particles released into the atmosphere after the explosion and fire at the nuclear power plant spread over much of @entity21 and what was then the western @entity44 tragedy : the fallout from the nuclear disaster was so dangerous @entity44 authorities evacuated 350,000 residents , establishing an exclusion zone extending 19 miles out from the plant in all directions fenced - off : the area within the exclusion zone , which is still in place 27 years on from the disaster , is largely uninhabited but for a few residents who refused to leave , and it has reverted to forest in places abandoned : the rusted remains of a boat are seen among the bare branches of the trees within the exclusion zone that surrounds the abandoned @entity121 in @entity8 suffering : the photographer said he wanted to reflect the ' mystical aspects ' of the land within the exclusion zone , where ' every inch is full of suffering and sorrow ' bleak outlook : mr @entity15 has criticised the decision to open the area around the @entity4 exclusion zone to tourists , and claims those who continue to suffer as a result of the disaster are being forgotten living in @entity135 : the area is sparsely populated by residents who refused to leave in the wake of the tragedy 27 years ago , and older people who have returned to the zone in recent years to be close to family graves surviving : the long - term effects of the catastrophe , which occurred when a systems test at the power plant near the city of @entity148 went disastrously wrong , are still being seen today desolate : the photographer said he was fascinated by the people living in and around the exclusion zone , and asked them whether they were afraid of radiation @entity73 : the photographer named his project @entity25 - a reference to the burning star in the @entity74 that fell upon rivers and made the water ' bitter ' contamination : mr @entity15 made several visits to the zone over a period of five years to capture the lasting effects of the disaster almost 30 years ago monochrome : mr @entity15 's photograph of the desolate area of @entity8 are all devoid of colour , but he has said the zone is ' more alive than people think ' accident : a systems test at the power plant went disastrously wrong in 1986 , triggering the worst nuclear disaster in history sense of normality : a small minority of residents decided to continue living in the shadow of the abandoned nuclear power plant fallout : the exclusion zone extends 19 miles in all directions from the abandoned plant			1

catastrophe at @entity4 nuclear power plant in @entity8 in 1986 sent clouds of radiation into the atmosphere
