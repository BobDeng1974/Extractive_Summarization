just when you thought one of the cheapest wines in @entity3 ca n't get any worse - one @entity3 woman has discovered a clever way to turn casked wine into sparkling ' champagne '			1
with a @entity9 and a cask of wine – or goon as it 's popularly known - it takes just seconds to insert some bubbles into the wine , according to a ' how - to ' video published on @entity16			1
the footage shows an elderly woman filling up a @entity9 bottle with goon as she tells the camera to ‘ not waste money ’ on expensive champagne while demonstrating how simple the technique is			1
the woman , believed to be @entity27 from @entity28 , can be seen threading the bottle onto the machine and with a push of the button , the wine compresses into fizzy ' champagne ' within seconds			1
‘ well there you go – now i ’ve got to wait for it to settle a bit ’ , the woman said as she pulls out a cleaning towel to stop the ‘ overflow ’			2
‘ that ’s the overflow – do n’t worry that wo n’t get wasted – i ’ll tip it into my glass , ’ the woman said			2
‘ @entity57 , now i have a glass with ice in it and i ’ll get one that i made previously , alright ? ‘ that would wait for that to settle down a little bit			0
you do n’t want it to be exploding everywhere			0
’ she turns to her fridge and pulls out a bottle that she made previously and pours it over the ice cubes			0
‘ now this is one that i made prior , ’ she said			0
‘ now just look at that – champagne – cost you about $ 17 dollars for a five litre cask to buy – whether it ’d be red or white – ok and you can make yourself litres and litres and litres and litres of champagne [ sic ]			1
’ she fills up the bottle with wine before she threads it onto the machine and with a push - it starts compressing she kisses her finger tips as a gesture that it is perfect and starts embracing her champagne as she sips away before saying : ‘ bloody beautiful ’			1
‘ you can put strawberries in it – whatever you want to put in it and you can even put a little bit of cordial in it but i love it as it is , ' she said			0
@entity90 says ‘ @entity91 ’ as she winks at the screen and ends the video saying : ' catch ya later ! i ’ve got drinking to do			2
’ the video , titled ‘ @entity96 how to make champagne out of wine , this is dedicated to my gorgeous niece ’s [ sic ] ’ has received more than 55,000 views and dozens of comments			1
within seconds , the wine starts compressing and turns into champagne - she let 's it ' settle for a bit ' bon appetit : @entity90 starts sipping away her champagne that she made previously prior to the video @entity112 posted : ‘ this is what makes @entity3 so great			1
" litres and litres and litres and @entity122 cheryl ! do n't let ' em fool you , this is exactly how they do it in @entity117 too [ sic ]			0
’ @entity123 said : ‘ i love this lady ! ! ! thanks for the tip ! ’ while others did n’t agree with the technique , with @entity129 saying : ‘ very very dangerous ... sorry ... great idea ! but the sugars in the wine will eventually stop up the pressure relief valve and your bottle will explode very forcefully ’ @entity136 said : technically just fizzy wine and very dangerous probably best to just stick with sodas ’			2
a caption along the video reads : ‘ make , drink , enjoy trace , @entity142 and who ever else are interested in this fantastic idea			0
do n't drink and drive and stay alive ’ .			0
