by @entity0 , @entity1 former triathlon world champion @entity2 has been ruled out of the @entity3 through injury in a huge blow to @entity6			1
@entity6 had hoped triathlon might provide two medals with @entity2 and reigning world champion @entity9 in line to compete in @entity11 but both have been forced out			1
@entity13 has not raced at all this season and her hopes of making the startline in @entity18 next thursday were ended in june when she sustained a stress fracture in her ankle as she tried to recover from a foot problem			2
out : @entity2 will miss the @entity3 through injury dragon : the former world champion had been set to represent @entity6 in @entity11 tuesday 's news is particularly cruel for @entity2 , the world champion in 2008 and 2011 , after her hopes of @entity27 gold in @entity28 were ruined by a knee injury			1
she raced and finished fifth but did not compete again until earlier this season and even contemplated retirement before finally getting to the bottom of the knee problem			0
@entity2 ' comeback had been very encouraging , the 30 - year - old finishing on the podium in the @entity38 races in @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 to put her second in the world rankings			1
but she pulled out of last saturday 's race in @entity45 during the run because of a foot problem			0
the decision was described as precautionary but further tests have shown the injury is likely to end @entity2 ' season			2
she said : ' i 'm obviously devastated			0
i was very proud to be selected to represent @entity6 and was looking forward to racing on a tough , honest triathlon course in @entity18			1
' i will get more information from the specialist this week but with a grade two tear of my @entity57 , it 's almost certain that i wo n't be racing again this season			0
' i particularly want to thank my support team who have worked so hard to get me back racing after such a difficult 18 months after the @entity27			0
' leading the pack : @entity2 represented @entity62 at @entity63 the women 's race had looked set to be a mouthwatering duel between @entity6 and @entity67 , who will be represented by world number three @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
the remaining @entity74 triathletes are not medal contenders , and @entity76 , chef de mission of @entity6 , said : ' it 's undoubtedly a huge blow to the team and she 'll be sorely missed but first and foremost our thoughts are with @entity2			2
' we wish her a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing her in action again in the near future			0
' @entity70 will go into the race as the gold medal favourite with her main challenge now likely to come from @entity87 and @entity88 .			0
