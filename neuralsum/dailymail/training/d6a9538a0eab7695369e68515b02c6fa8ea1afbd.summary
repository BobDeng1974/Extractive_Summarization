a grandfather battling cancer claims he managed to cure himself of the disease using cannabis oil			1
@entity4 , 63 , was diagnosed in 2009 after blacking out at work - and was given a transplant in november that year			1
he was given the all - clear but says the disease came back in late 2012 - attacking the new organ he had been given			0
he claims that just three days after taking the class b drug , his excruciating pain disappeared			1
in may this year , the grandfather - of - nine went for a biopsy at the @entity24 in @entity25			0
dr @entity26 , @entity27 ’s science communications manager , told @entity28 : ' we know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours			1
' but at the moment there is n’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients			1
' despite this , we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts			1
' these stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not , although this is weak evidence compared to properly - run clinical trials			0
' @entity27 is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid in order to gather solid data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer			0
' to his relief , doctors told him the new cancerous cells had vanished			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity24 confirmed mr @entity4 had not received any cancer treatment since his transplant in november 2009			2
mr @entity4 , a retired builder from @entity70 , @entity71 , said : ' finding out i could die was terrible			2
' all i had in those dark days was my laptop , and that 's when i began searching for something else that could help me - i could n't accept i was going to die			2
' when i found out i was cured i was just completely shocked			0
i 'm a normal family man , not a druggie			0
i had a serious illness and this helped			0
' he started taking cannabis after watching a video online about how it could help cure the disease			2
after purchasing the drug through a dealer , he began to cultivate his own tablets from the oil , taking one capsule a day			2
when his symptoms disappeared after three days , he began growing his own cannabis plant to keep up a steady supply of the medication			0
mr @entity4 was one of the speakers at an event last week about the medical use of cannabis - along with professor @entity98 and mp @entity99 at @entity100			1
he is now campaigning for changes in the law to allow the oil and other forms of cannabis to be legally used medicinally to treat other people			0
when his symptoms disappeared after three days , mr @entity4 began growing his own cannabis plant to keep up a steady supply of the medication research published last week by scientists at the @entity111 found the main psychoactive ingredient in @entity113 or @entity114 - has been shown to help combat the growth of cancerous cells			1
dr @entity26 , @entity27 ’s science communications manager , said : ' these experiments were done using cancer cells grown in the lab or in mice and the results help to unpick the details of how cannabinoids affect cancer cells at a molecular level			1
' this could potentially lead to more effective treatments for cancer in the future , but there ’s still no good data from clinical trials to show that cannabis or cannabinoids can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients at the moment			1
' cannabinoids help to control brain and nerve activity , energy metabolism , heart function , the immune system and even reproduction			0
as a result , a number of charities have intensified their research into the use of cannabis as a medical drug			0

tests late last year *revealed* @entity4 had cancerous cells in his liver
*worried* he might die , he took to the *internet* to search for a cure
discovered cannabis oil - and bought some of the drug to make his own
claims his excruciating pain disappeared three days after taking the potion
and that tests a few *months* later showed the cancer cells had gone
research currently *underway* into whether cannabis can help treat cancer
