the @entity1 ( building pictured ) rejected an invitation to stage a prestigious event celebrating press freedom , it has been suggested yesterday a source close to the arrangements said : ‘ the @entity4 are saying the reasons are logistical but it seems obvious this could not be held in @entity4 without the problems over the @entity8 being highlighted internationally			1
‘ you might well think the government was afraid it would get a black eye			0
but they are now facing two black eyes			0
’ @entity10 is now considering holding the event in @entity39 , where @entity41 law prohibits criticism of the monarchy and effectively bars independent coverage of taboo subjects such as the military , national security , religion and sexuality			1
journalists in @entity39 , according to watchdog @entity51 , face violence and intimidation , as well as heavy fines and prison sentences , in retribution for their stories			1
press freedom organisations last month urged @entity59 to persuade @entity60 to repeal legislation underpinning the government ’s @entity8 on press regulation , which was drawn up by politicians in the wake of the @entity66 into alleged wrongdoing by journalists			2
in a letter to the prime minister , seven major international bodies – including the @entity69 – described the @entity8 as ‘ incomprehensible arcana ’ and warned that ‘ autocratic ’ foreign leaders were already using it to justify repression			0
newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom			2
instead , the @entity41 is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities , known as the @entity83			0
it will be able to impose fines of up to £ 1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing			0
press freedom organisations last month urged @entity59 to persuade @entity60 to repeal legislation underpinning the @entity87 s @entity8 on press regulation @entity89 is an annual event held every may 3 , and includes the awarding of @entity10 ’s @entity91 for courage in journalism and a seminar			1
it celebrated its 20th anniversary last year , when it was held in @entity97 , @entity98			2
it is held in a different country each year and has never been held in @entity4			2
@entity10 says the aims of @entity12 are ‘ to evaluate press freedom around the world , to defend the media from attacks on their independence and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession ’			1
@entity10 approached the @entity1 having originally planned to hold the event in @entity113			1
if it can not be held in @entity39 , the event is likely to be held in @entity115 , at @entity10 ’s headquarters			1
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we were recently approached by @entity10 after their plans for the event to be hosted in a different country had fallen through			1
while we are very supportive of the aims of @entity12 , we judged that we would not be able to prepare a suitable set of events to mark the occasion at short notice			1
the @entity1 is involved in hosting three major summits this year			2
’ news of the refusal comes after the industry ’s bid to seek a judicial review of the @entity134 ’s decision not to approve a rival @entity8 was rejected – in a one - paragraph ruling which took 17 weeks to arrive			2
a secretive committee of four ministers approved a @entity8 to regulate the press last year			0
the @entity134 , which advises the @entity139 , rubberstamped the plans after newspapers were denied a last - ditch legal bid to halt the process			0
four newspaper and magazine industry bodies went to the @entity146 to seek an injunction to prevent the @entity134 proceeding			0
but it was only when the hearing was under way that lawyers for the industry realised that , without warning the papers , the judges had also decided to rule on a separate application for judicial review of the @entity134 ’s ‘ unfair , irrational and unlawful ’ decision not to approve a rival @entity8 drawn up by the newspapers			0
@entity160 , sitting with mr @entity159 , rejected the application for judicial review and for an injunction			0
the two judges retired to consider their verdict for 15 minutes before returning to deliver a ruling that ran to 3,000 words – leaving a strong suspicion it had been prepared in advance			0
the industry then applied for permission to appeal against the @entity146 decision to refuse to grant permission to apply for judicial review			0
this time it took 17 weeks for a decision to be made – and when it finally was , it amounted to one paragraph in which @entity179 refused permission to appeal .			0
