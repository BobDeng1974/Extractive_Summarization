by @entity0 while fashion most often celebrates clothes that are visible on the outside , a new exhibit diverges from the norm by focusing on what ’s worn underneath			0
the museum at the @entity9 ’s new show ‘ @entity13 ’ explores the evolution of underpinnings from the 18th century to modern day			1
in doing so , the exhibit 's 70 - some artifacts uncover how the shape and tone of clothing has shifted as a result – tracing the differences in color , shape , and idealized body forms along the way			1
tracing history : the museum at the @entity9 's new exhibit exposed : a history of @entity28 , traces the evolution of underpinnings throughout time ( pictured , a 1951 @entity32 petticoat and a 1949 @entity34 bra exemplify the mid century feminine form ) exercising restraint : throughout time , lingerie has yo - yo 'd between phases of freedom and constriction , the latter of which is the case with these two corsets ( pictured , a @entity47 design circa 1960 , left , and a 1954 @entity48 for @entity49 , right ) leisure : the @entity51 , lingerie-wise , are epitomized by their glamorous loungewear , like this printed robe by @entity55 , circa 1942 the exhibit opens with a series of relatively modern garments to epitomize this journey			1
a nylon evening gown by the mid-century designer @entity61 is displayed beside a nylon nightgown by the decade ’s equally celebrated lingerie label @entity65			0
in doing so , curator @entity66 pinpoints how ms @entity61 was an innovator in her own right , by pulling inspiration from one of the more personal aspects of a woman ’s wardrobe			0
she was among the first designers to take nylon from a lingerie - specific affair and appropriate it for every day , conventional use			1
a similar argument is made with two 19th century corsets , shown beside a 2007 @entity81 corseted dress who ’s boning is exposed with bright topstitching			1
even though the garments were created centuries apart , their foundations - so to speak - share a likeminded seed			2
carrying on , the exhibit runs in chronological order – displaying lingerie ’s true journey from functional objects with distinctive social purposes to accessories that prioritize fashion and frill			0
the 17th and 18th century ’s requisite corsets , which not only pushed a woman ’s bust to exorbitant heights , but also shrank their waists to similarly small lengths , displays how women were best perceived at the time			1
deeper meaning : buried within the beauty of this intricate @entity105 ( circa 1770 ) is a socioeconomic message ; due to the artifact 's constrictive nature and @entity112 court hue , its wearer likely led a life of work - free leisure striking shape : the rise of steel in the industrial 19th century led to innovations in fashion as well , including this underskirt and corset - used to cut the era 's infamous s - curve silhouette - which utilize metal instead of whalebone to achieve its structure as is typical with historical fashion exhibits , @entity9 ’s exploration of lingerie delves into each decade ’s high - fashion , premium trends - which until the late 20th century , were dictated by aristocracy			1
with this in mind , it is clear that within the corset ’s constrictive whalebone gussets lies a deeper , socioeconomic message			0
one of the show ’s artifacts - a cornflower blue corset that dates back to the 1770s - is an example of this larger discussion			1
not only do its structured lines imply that its wearer would be rendered nearly immobile , but its frilly bow epaulets and royal hue ( at least by @entity112 court standards ) demonstrate that its wearer led a life of work - free leisure			2
and that is not to mention how the corset ’s laced closure - positioned up the back - required at least one servant ’s help to tighten , and later loosen , the strings each day			1
while the @entity160 movement ’s corsets displayed a wash of restrained color , by the end of the next century things had turned comparably acid toned – courtesy of the development of artificial dyes			2
but by the turn of the 20th century the western world ’s then - longstanding tradition for busty appearances and voluptuous waistlines suddenly took a sharp turn towards androgyny			2
on view : the 19th century 's social standard for house calls meant that even the most leisurely of women needed to look well - dressed , even when relaxing at home ; garments like this @entity112 tea gown from 1900 was enlisted in the lives of aristocrats who needed to be ready to accept visitors at the drop of a hat sweet dreams : compared to the 1920s straight flapper silhouette , this nightgown from the @entity190 demonstrates how the decade preferred a more shapely figure , while still cutting a slim form this is most evident in the exhibit ’s showing of lingerie from the @entity199 , which provides little in the way of support , lift , or shaping			1
a delicate bandeau bra from the decade is more of an aesthetic experiment in ribbon and lace than it is an aid in supporting one ’s assets : emphasizing how the ideal flapper body ’s straight lines took a larger hold on consumer culture at the time			0
women of more diverse proportions were better accommodated the following decade with the @entity190 ’ penchant for all - in - one girdles that provided a support to the bust , a lightly corseted nip to the waist , and a delicate slip for coverage underneath the era ’s filmy , feminine dresses			2
the return to a curvier form became even more exaggerated in the @entity51 , where strong shoulders and a tiny waist were widely favored			0
but where the decade stood out most , lingerie-wise , was in its approach to chamber dressing			0
diaphanous nightgowns and robes were popularized through golden - age films , where @entity241 femme fatales like @entity242 and @entity243 could be seen wearing at - home attire that could have hold its own at a debutante soiree			2
@entity247 natural : by the 1970s , the advent of synthetic fibers and a new natural look helped pave the way for underpinnings like this 1977 set by @entity253 ; its wireless , padding - free design allowed for a woman 's natural breast shape to remain intact while wearing this preference for unabashed femininity was taken to a new level in the @entity261 , where the advent of crinolines , as well as conical bras , was instrumental in creating an iconic look			2
without these two underpinnings , the decade ’s pluming skirts and pert sweater sets would not have received their necessary lift – leaving what is now known as the @entity272 look without its precarious oomph			0
but like most things in fashion , for those who inhabited the era , this look soon became stale and tired – making room for the refined and somewhat radical freedoms of the @entity280 and @entity281			0
the era ’s au natural movement heralded unlined , unwired bras			0
those who wished to retain a modicum of conservatism found a bit of comfort in relatively miniscule slips			0
loungewear , or pajama - dressing as it is known today , was widely welcomed in the @entity281 , when at - home entertaining was a weekly social standby			0
again turning a leaf , the @entity294 , as @entity9 ’s exhibit points out , was home to high - octane cuts , bust lines , and sumptuous fabrics that reflect the decade ’s more - is - more sensibility			1
modern fare : this @entity303 set from 2005 is just one of the many choices available to the modern lingerie consumers , who now has more choices than ever before when shopping for underpinnings modern lingerie - as is highlighted through artifacts by designers including @entity303 , @entity312 , and @entity313 - is defined by its ability to strike a balance between function , form , fashion , and novelty			1
as is the case with many commercial items today , consumers have access to the widest array of products perhaps in history – rendering the trajectory of lingerie as one that is dictated by its wearers , rather than industry			0
@entity9 ’s exposed : a history of @entity28 , is on view in the museum ’s @entity337 through november 15 .			1
