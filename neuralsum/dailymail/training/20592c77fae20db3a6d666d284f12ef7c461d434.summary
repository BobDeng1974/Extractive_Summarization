the @entity9 leader said he was ‘ appalled ’ at the newspaper ’s refusal to retract its article about @entity16 – headlined ‘ the man who hated @entity11 ’ – and launched a petition to condemn it			1
but the newspaper said it stood by every word of its essay , which some commentators praised as a fair profile of a refugee to @entity11 who was a staunch supporter of what the @entity3 calls ‘ one of the world ’s most poisonous political doctrines ’			1
family : @entity2 and father @entity16 , pictured in @entity28 in 1989 @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 issued expressions of sympathy for the @entity9 leader , but others said this newspaper had been right to highlight the academic ’s formative influences on his son as he vies to become prime minister			1

the critique of @entity16 , who died in 1994 , was published in saturday ’s edition of the @entity3			1
the newspaper quoted the 17 - year - old @entity16 writing during the @entity51 that ‘ the @entity52 is a rabid nationalist ’ and ‘ you sometimes want them almost to lose ( the war ) to show them how things are ’			2
war of words : @entity2 wrote a rebuttal to the @entity3 piece in yesterday 's paper aged 45 , he wrote of his disdain for the @entity64 , saying it included : ‘ @entity67 and @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , the great clubs , the @entity72 , the @entity73 , the @entity74 , the respectable sunday papers ... the @entity76 ... social hierarchies , @entity77			1
’ in yesterday ’s paper , @entity2 responded by writing an article , which the @entity3 published in full , in which he insisted his father had loved @entity11			1
he told the @entity81 yesterday : ‘ it ’s perfectly legitimate for the @entity3 to talk about my father ’s politics but when they say that he hated @entity11 i was not willing to put up with that because my father loved @entity11			2
‘ my father served in the @entity89 , he was a refugee who came here and found security in this country			0
‘ he took great comfort from what this country offered him and i ’m speaking out as a son			0

a raucous and robust press is a critical safeguard of freedom			0

’ @entity129 , of @entity130 , said : ‘ @entity2 has often used his father , and talked about his father in speeches and in his self - presentation as his inspiration			2
‘ it is quite reasonable to look into what @entity16 believes			2
' while he may not have hated @entity11 , he certainly disapproved of many of the founding institutions of the state and was at odds with them			0
’ many callers to @entity28 station @entity145 said mr @entity2 ’s penchant for name - checking his late father in his own political speeches meant he should expect some scrutiny of his father ’s @entity6 beliefs			1
in an editorial published alongside mr @entity2 ’s response yesterday , the @entity3 refused to apologise and asked how his father ’s @entity6 vision could possibly be declared out of bounds for public discussion			1
views : former deputy prime minister @entity109 told @entity110 that @entity16 was ' no democrat ' last night a spokesman for the @entity3 said : ‘ we ask fair - minded people to read our editorial today			1
for what this episode confirms is that you can not allow politicians anywhere near regulating the @entity167			0
‘ while we respect mr @entity2 ’s right to defend his father – and he has done so in the @entity3 today – it is worth stressing that @entity16 was n’t an ordinary private individual but a prominent academic and author who devoted his life to promoting a @entity6 dogma which caused so much misery in the world			1
