by @entity0 he does n’t really have to dance a jig			1
a choreographer ’s fee is almost certainly not included in his contract for the @entity6 @entity5			1
and the idea of using the @entity8 to reprise his double act with @entity11 is , as @entity12 himself suggests , a little dated			1
to be honest , the sporting public will just be happy to see @entity12 – our mo – doing what he does best at @entity17			1
national hero : @entity19 has won @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 titles running for @entity24 that means possibly going for one of the longest standing @entity28 records in this month ’s glittering @entity30 event			1
and then delivering double gold at @entity32			1
no need for whistles , bells … or crazy celebrations			1
yet @entity19 , asked if he and the world ’s fastest man might go for a repeat of their @entity42 smash hit , when @entity11 did the @entity44 and @entity12 struck the sprinter ’s famous @entity11 pose , laughed as he declared : ‘ nah , it ’s been done already			1
you ’ve got to come up with something new			1
maybe a @entity50 dance ! ’ oh mo , do n’t give the promoters any ideas			1
they ’ll have you done up in a kilt and spearing a haggis before you can say ‘ photo opportunity ’			1
that fact that both @entity11 and @entity19 are now scheduled to compete at the @entity8 is , of course , a boost to an athletics public about to feast on a double helping of track and field			1
embraced : despite running for @entity65 in @entity6 , @entity12 will be cheered by the @entity50 crowds @entity19 ’s appearance in a special two - mile race at the @entity6 @entity5 , partly to help readjust to life back on the track following his short - lived excursions into marathon running , will undoubtedly be the biggest draw in a two - day festival bringing many of the world ’s best to @entity78			1
might @entity28 ’s greatest distance runner , a man who admits that world records over 5k and 10k are part of his long - term ambition , be tempted to have a crack at @entity85 ’s @entity28 record for the rarely - run two - mile race – a record that has stood since 1978 ? ‘ i have n’t thought too much about it but , at the same time , @entity85 did it pretty well , ’ he said			1
‘ we will have a think as we get closer to it			2
‘ it would be nice to run good times and go fast but i do n’t know how close it would be to get to the world record of 12:37mins for 5k or the 10k at 26:17mins			2
‘ realistically , i can get closer but it all depends on what happens after the @entity102 , with the worlds next year and then the @entity21			2
you have to plan , sit down with your team and see what ’s what			2
‘ it ’s hard to say exactly where i am at the minute			2
the 5k i ran a few weeks ago was just to test myself			2
but it seems to be going in the right direction			2
champions : @entity19 celebrated with @entity11 after they each won @entity113 at @entity42 ‘ coming off the marathon , it was n’t easy			1
i came off the marathon and took a break			2
but it ’s quite exciting , the way things are going			2
‘ the marathon was great fun			2
i would n’t change anything in terms of how i prepared			0
a lot of people talk about the marathon but , unless you give it a go , you ’ll never know			0
‘ i ’m glad i gave it a go			0
i did everything , prepared well , but it was my first marathon			0
hopefully i will improve because of the experience			0
‘ after the marathon , i took it all quite slowly but , when things started going the right way , i decided to do the @entity102			0
now i ’m trying to peak for the @entity102 , that is the aim			0
‘ @entity138 will let us see what i can do , see what kind of shape i ’m in			0
this will let me see how i ’m going , then i can head into the @entity8 , which will be quite exciting			0
‘ any competition at this level will be hard			0
in the @entity102 , it ’s going to be hard because of the guys running against me			0
backing : the @entity147 is hoping to repeat his 2012 double in front of another supportive stadium ‘ but that ’s what i need , to race against the @entity152 , the @entity153 … it ’s tense but it should be exciting			0
’ @entity19 is still based in @entity156 for the most of the year , embracing the notoriously low profile of track and field in the @entity160 – a far cry from the kind of commotion he ’d cause trying to wander through the streets of his home town of @entity147			1
still , he misses plenty about @entity28 , listing football , big breakfasts and cups of tea – in that order – before admitting that he ’s regularly up early to watch his beloved @entity173 on tv , while he ’s currently tuning into @entity175 even while running on his treadmill			0
as for @entity78 ’s national football stadium , well , he ’s never even been to @entity17			0
not so much as seen a picture of the new track , nor spoken to a soul who has			0
world champion : since @entity183 has added @entity22 and @entity184 to his cv memories of running at the @entity187 in january 2012 linger still , though , with the reception he got from the crowd that day inspiring hope for more of the same this summer			1
he is likely , then , to join a very select band of @entity65 superstars to have received a standing ovation at the grand old ground			1
twice in the space of two weeks , too			0
‘ when it comes to athletics , we tend to come together as the @entity28 , ’ he said			0
‘ even though i ’m going to be competing for @entity65 , i think the @entity50 people will still be behind me			1
’ that ’s a pretty safe bet			0
even if you do n’t throw in a fling , a burl or a leading role in a 40,000 - some reel			1
watch 47 global medallists including @entity12 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity212 star at the @entity214 ’s @entity213 as a part of the @entity30 series			0

@entity19 says he has to come up with something new if he wins
long - distance runner will be representing @entity65 in @entity6
but @entity42 hero can expect a warm welcome from @entity50 crowd
