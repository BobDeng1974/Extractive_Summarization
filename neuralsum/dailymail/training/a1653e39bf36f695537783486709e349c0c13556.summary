the man , who can only be identified as mr @entity1 , was handed an order preventing him from seeing his children or entering his street			1
mr justice @entity5 ( above ) overturned the order at appeal a father suffered a kafkaesque injustice when he was thrown out of his home without warning and effectively barred from seeing his six children for five months , a high court judge said yesterday			1
after being banned from his street , the man was later jailed overnight and convicted of a crime for phoning his wife			1
mr @entity17 accused lawyers and courts of injustice due to ‘ unproven allegations ’			0
the father , named only as mr @entity1 , was barred from his home after his wife took out a non-molestation order			1
he was also forbidden from contacting her except via her lawyers			0
such orders are designed to protect women from domestic violence			0
but mr @entity17 said the ban was granted ‘ in proceedings of which [ mr @entity1 ] was unaware ’			1
the hearing before a district judge on june 20 lasted no more than five minutes			0
mrs @entity34 ’s lawyers did not attempt to contact her husband and he knew nothing of the order until he came home from work one day later that month			2
despite the claim that his wife was in danger of violence , she allowed him to stay overnight and he left the following morning			0
days later , he was arrested for an ‘ innocuous breach ’ of the order after calling his wife to ask about the case , mr @entity17 said			2
she phoned police and he was held overnight and taken to court			0
with no lawyer , he pleaded guilty to breaking the order , and was sentenced to a day in prison			0
‘ he was a man of good character who now has a criminal record , ’ mr @entity17 said			2
‘ and … the effect of the original order was to deprive him of contact with his children for fully five months			2
all in all , mr @entity1 could be forgiven for feeling like the hapless protagonist in @entity61 ’s @entity60			1
’ the novel tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote authority , which never specifies the crime he is supposed to have committed			0
the man was handed the order after his wife went to @entity71 's @entity70 ( pictured )			1
mr justice @entity5 said mr @entity1 could be forgiven for feeling like @entity74 - in @entity61 's 1925 novel @entity60 @entity60 is the terrifying novel about @entity74 , a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested			1
the book , which was written in 1914 but not published until 1925 - a year after author @entity61 ’s death - follows @entity74 's need to defend himself against the charge about which he can get no information			1
it details his struggles and encounters with the law and the courts following his arrest , which came on his 30th birthday despite the fact he had committed no wrong - doing			0
mr @entity17 said that following marriage problems , mrs @entity34 had contacted solicitors in may , hoping to persuade mr @entity1 to leave			1
the lawyers applied for a court order , saying the wife was at risk of harm			2
they claimed mr @entity1 had shoved her , thrown objects , and had pushed her to the floor 17 years ago			1
the application added that the wife had previously been expected to ‘ engage in distasteful sexual practices ’ and that her husband had controlled the finances			0
but mr @entity17 said the only recent incident listed was a row over a credit card bill and that the order was ‘ entirely unrealistic ’			2
it was five months before an appeal reached the @entity70 , which ruled the order should never have been made			0
it found 11 injustices by the courts that granted and maintained the order			0
the father , who can now see his children , told the court in a letter he was ‘ disillusioned with the justice system … which removes me from my home and family with a completely fabricated statement ’			0
a police report said mrs @entity34 begged officers not to arrest mr @entity1 over his phone call and that her solicitor had told her to contact them			1

@entity134 banned from seeing his children and entering home for ten years
order issued after wife *complained* she was a victim of domestic *assault*
man , named only as mr @entity1 , had no prior notice of the non-molestation order
*slapped* with order arriving home from work after wife *requested* it *secretly*
@entity151 said mr @entity1 , who can not be identified , could have been forgiven for feeling like @entity74 - the protagonist in @entity61 's 1925 novel @entity60
