a @entity1 businessman who escaped jail by fleeing @entity3 after having an affair with a married mother has returned to the country to try and get the conviction quashed , @entity8 can reveal			1
@entity9 was convicted in @entity10 in 2009 of having illicit sex with @entity12			1
ms @entity12 , a 46 - year - old @entity1 mother - of - two , was convicted of adultery in the strictly @entity16 @entity15 when her husband @entity17 accused her of cheating on him			1
she was jailed for three months and lost custody of her two sons in a notorious case that made headlines around the world			1
she then lost custody of her two sons counter claim : ms @entity12 claims that her husband , @entity17 , above , made up the adultery claim to win custody			1
she then went on to allege that it was he who was having the affair in an ironic twist , ms @entity12 's husband then moved in with the @entity37 woman she said he was having an affair with - but escaped scot - free			1
and in the latest development in the six - year saga , oil - worker mr @entity9 is trying to get the case quashed because more than five years have passed since the original conviction			1
his lawyer @entity43 told @entity10 : ' my client is a married man and a father and lives a happy and stable life			0
his family depends on him			0
' he was sentenced in absentia more than five years ago			1
we ask the court to dismiss the case due to time lapse			2
' ms @entity12 was embroiled in a lengthy , bitter and eventually futile battle with her husband to keep her children			1
the pair married in a dream wedding in the @entity59 in 1999 but not long after their sons @entity63 , now 13 , and @entity64 , 10 , were born , the marriage fell apart			2
according to ms @entity12 , a former florist and teaching assistant , they split acrimoniously after she discovered he had been having an affair with @entity37 former actress @entity70 , 52			1
the @entity37 businesswoman met mr @entity17 , 47 , while visiting @entity3 in 2007			1
his wife said she threw him out after discovering a love letter from @entity74			0
but her nightmare began in march 2008 when mr @entity17 told police it was she who was having an affair			2
anguish : ms @entity12 was caught on video handing over the boys after going on the run for a month with them adultery is a criminal offence in the @entity15 and ms @entity12 contends her estranged husband hurled accusations in a bid to win sole custody of their children			1
police who raided her family home found her having tea with mr @entity9 , the brother of ms @entity12 's friend , who was visiting @entity3			1
despite her claims the friendship was innocent and she had only met mr @entity9 three times , officers seized five used condoms and emails			1
the condoms bearing her dna ( although mr @entity9 was never tested ) were enough to seal her conviction in november 2008 , although she maintained they were planted by mr @entity17 , a former executive with pharmaceuticals firm @entity106			2
she appealed and had the sentence reduced to three months in february 2009			2
crucially though , she lost custody of her sons			2
she went on the run for a month to enjoy a few last precious moments with her children , but then handed over the sobbing boys in heartrending scenes outside @entity3 criminal courts and gave herself in			1
' i was searched and most of my personal items were confiscated , ' she said on her release			0
' i had to beg the woman guard to let me keep five photos of the children			2
' i was strip - searched			2
' during her time in prison , she shared cells with murderers and prostitutes and lost nearly a stone			0
the thought of seeing her boys again kept her going			0
' speaking to them on the phone kept me sane , ' she said at the time			0
' yet at one point , @entity17 would n't let me			0
' she insisted : ' i have done nothing wrong			0
i am a good mother and while my ex-husband would not hurt a hair on the children 's heads , what he is doing is wrong			0
love quadrangle : mr @entity17 married @entity70 in 2010 and has set up home with her in @entity145 ' i never had an affair			0
i knew i would be going to prison and just wanted four weeks with my babies so i could spend as much time with them as possible and so they would know i never intended to leave them			0
' mr @entity17 , meanwhile , contended : ' i am the victim in this			0
@entity12 has done horrible things			2
' she was eventually released and her compulsory deportation order waived so she could stay in @entity3 and have access to the children			0
mr @entity17 , in the meantime , married miss @entity70 in 2010 and moved in with her in @entity158 - but not before bringing a civil lawsuit claiming emotional and psychological damage and being awarded Â£ 3,500 compensation from ms @entity12			1
in the latest twist , mr @entity9 is pushing to get the case thrown out			1
mr @entity43 told the court : ' the defence will not discuss the details of the crime considering it is more than five years old			0
' we are seeking to have the legal action halted against the defendant and have the case dropped			0
my client 's family is waiting for him			0
' just why he is seeking to face justice after all this time is unclear .			0
