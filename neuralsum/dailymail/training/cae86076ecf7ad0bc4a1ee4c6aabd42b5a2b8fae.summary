by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:49 am on 21st december 2011 change of plea : @entity3 will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street 's trash bin near @entity9 ' home ground @entity10 a @entity12 immigrant will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street 's trash bin near @entity9 ' home ground @entity10			1
@entity3 , 23 , also talked about poisoning @entity17 , bombing a landmark skyscraper and assassinating the then mayor of @entity20			1
he initially pleaded not guilty to charges that he received a fake bomb he believed was real from undercover @entity24 agents last year			1
but attorneys have now told a federal judge he will plead guilty under an agreement worked out with prosecutors - a deal experts say may reflect the enormous odds he would face a trial			2
at a hearing in @entity20 , @entity33 district judge @entity32 set a date of february 14 for @entity3 to change his plea			1
but neither side offered details about exactly what charges he would plead guilty to , and government and defence attorneys declined to comment after the hearing			0
@entity3 has a strong incentive to reduce his potential prison time via a plea deal			1
a conviction on just one of the charges against him - attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction - carries a maximum life prison term			0
@entity53 : @entity3 dropped a backpack outside @entity10 , the home of @entity9 legal expert @entity55 said suspects in terrorism cases have one overwhelming incentive to cut a plea agreement and to avoid taking the case to a jury : they almost never win at trial			1
@entity55 , a director of the centre on @entity64 at @entity65 in @entity66 , said : ' and there 's a very realistic chance of a very high sentence after trial			0
you just ca n't play around			0
' according to her centre , out of 42 defendants charged with using or attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction since the september 11 attacks , there has been just one acquittal			0
a total of 15 defendants have been convicted , five had the charge dropped and 21 of the cases are still pending			0
another expert said federal authorities also like to avoid a trial when possible , in part from fear that revelations in court could inspire copycats or inadvertently aid would - be terrorists honing their own plots			0
claims : out of 42 defendants charged with using or attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction since the september 11 attacks , there has been just one acquittal @entity98 , a professor who teaches about homeland security at @entity100 , said : ' maybe the same methods can be used again or terrorists can learn from another guy 's mistakes			0
' defence attorneys have described @entity3 as gullible and prone to wild boasts - but as having no links to extremists			1
they also told reporters last year they would explore the possibility of using the trial defence that @entity3 was duped by federal agents			1
a point of contention in recent filings was a defence request for the government to release the identity of an informant who tipped off authorities about @entity3			1
that informant befriended @entity3 while at least two @entity24 undercover agents also got in touch , posing as co-plotters			1
the defence claimed the informant would have been a key figure at trial because they allege he at one point threatened @entity3 not to back out of the plot			2
prosecutors say there is no evidence of any such threat and that identifying the confidential source would open him up to reprisals			0
while the pressure to cut a plea deal is heaviest on the defence , @entity55 said prosecutors often do not want to see their investigations subject to scrutiny			0
she said legitimate questions have been raised in this and other cases about whether there was some element of entrapment by federal agents			0
the jailed @entity3 , a one - time bakery worker , did not appear at tuesday 's hearing			2
he has shown up at earlier hearings - occasionally lifting his shackled hands to blow kisses to his mother on a spectators ' bench			0
according to prosecutors , @entity3 waffled about his plans , allegedly talking about profiting monetarily and another time broaching the idea of poisoning @entity17 or assassinating then - @entity20 mayor @entity160			1
while it was harmless , prosecutors have said the device planted by @entity3 near @entity10 appeared ominous - a paint can fitted with blasting caps and a timer			2
@entity3 was deadly serious about the plot and it was ' not a matter of talk or bravado ' , prosecutor @entity167 told a judge shortly after @entity3 's arrest last year .			2
