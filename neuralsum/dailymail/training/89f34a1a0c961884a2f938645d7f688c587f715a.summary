by @entity1 reporter published : 13:52 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 13:53 est , 31 august 2012 ' could become more dangerous ' : @entity2 a paedophile who downloaded child porn has been spared jail after a judge said locking him up could be more dangerous to society in the long term			1
@entity2 , 35 , of @entity14 , south @entity15 , had amassed a collection of around 2,700 indecent images when police raided his home earlier this year			1
the photographs and videos were later graded from one to five - with the higher the category , the more serious the offence			2
@entity24 heard almost a third of the images were at the higher end of the scale - with 786 level four and 29 level five images			2
the details of the photographs were so serious , judge @entity31 asked the media not to publish their details			0
he said : ' when the police investigated your computer , they found a staggering number of images that were indecent			2
' there was a very large number of them at the top end of the scale , at level four and five			0
' the natural reaction of any decent human being would be that you should go to prison for as long as possible			0
' but when the revulsion has subsided , the court must consider precisely what that would achieve			0
' you would go into prison as sex offender and still come out as one - just as dangerous if not more so than you are at the moment			1
' and the protection of the public must be of paramount concern to the court			2
' @entity60 ’s home was raided by police in march this year			1
despite a no - comment interview to officers , he later pleaded guilty to downloading indecent images before magistrates - who said their sentencing powers were not strong enough and referred the case to @entity24			1
defending barrister @entity69 said his client was deeply ashamed of his actions - but said @entity60 had accessed the images when he was suffering with severe depression			1
depraved : @entity24 ( above ) heard almost a third of the images downloaded by @entity60 were at the higher end of the scale mr @entity69 told the court the cause of the depression had been due to the defendant ’s difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality			1
in mitigation , he added @entity60 had also not distributed the images and had no previous convictions			1
judge @entity31 decided to make the defendant the subject of a sex offenders treatment programme for three years			1
he will also have to sign the sex offenders ' register until at least 2017 and undertake 250 hours of unpaid work			0
furthermore , @entity60 is not allowed to have any contact with any children under the age of 16 - either in person , on the telephone or via the internet - without the approval of their parents			2
he is also banned from deleting the browsing history on his computer as well as erasing any images from a digital camera or camera phone without permission from the police			0
judge @entity31 said : ' this is not a soft option			0
it is a particularly difficult one			0
' everybody now knows about you and your reputation has been exploded			0
' should you fail to comply with any of the court ’s orders then you will wind up in custody			0

@entity2 amassed nearly *3,000* indecent images
@entity88 said jail was not the best way to protest public
instead ordered @entity60 to *attend* three - year sex offender treatment programme
