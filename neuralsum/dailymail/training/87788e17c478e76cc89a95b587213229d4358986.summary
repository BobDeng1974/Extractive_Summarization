@entity1 star @entity0 , who plays @entity2 , has defended the show @entity1 star @entity0 has hit back at critics who have accused the courtroom drama of being ' unrealistic '			1
ms @entity0 defended the @entity7 show , adding writer @entity8 ' did his homework ' and consulted legal experts			1
the first series received wide - spread praise , but a highly - anticipated second series has been panned by fans and critics after a series of legal blunders and ludicrous storylines			1
over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes			1
the first episode frustrated viewers with its ‘ mumbling ’ dialogue and the second was littered with legal blunders			1
episode three included unrealistic scenes in which a mother appeared in court shortly after giving birth – and her baby appeared to be much older than a newborn			1
and in what disgruntled fans complained was the most far - fetched scene to date , @entity35 's character @entity34 was seen ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table at fast food chain @entity42			1
at the popular @entity45 restaurant , customers actually order and pay at the till at the same time			1
but the 36 - year - old actress , who plays @entity2 , told @entity66 : ' it 's not as if @entity8 would go into something like this and not do his homework			1
i can guarantee he knows it inside out			2
' but it is drama			1
you ca n't say that it 's right or wrong			1
it 's not a documentary , it 's entertainment			1
' the mother - of - two added , despite the inaccuracy , she enjoyed seeing the @entity81 in court as it heightened the drama			1
in one episode , @entity55 and @entity56 were present in court while @entity87 went on trial for the murder of their son @entity90			0
witnesses would never be able to do so in real life			0
' if people get angry about it , that 's their thing , ' she said			1
describing the situation as a ' @entity100 ' , ms @entity0 added the complaints were ' inevitable ' with a second series of a successful show			1
character @entity104 ( @entity105 ) was seen giving birth just hours before giving evidence in court viewers took to @entity110 to complain about an unrealistic scene involving table service at a @entity42 's restaurant digging up @entity90 's corpse what happened : @entity117 's parents @entity55 and @entity56 with prosecuting barrister @entity118 were horrified after @entity87 's defence team got @entity90 's body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family			1
but retired detective @entity125 told the @entity126 : ' the body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation			0
you would have to consult the family beforehand			0
the only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case			0
' use of spy cameras what happened : @entity34 installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity144 - where a terrified @entity2 is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from @entity148			0
@entity34 installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of @entity144 , but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court but @entity125 explains : ' i 'm afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court			0
of course , if you suspect somebody of an offence , you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent			0
' the wrong wig what happened : @entity167 ( @entity168 ) is the judge in the case of @entity87 but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case			2
why @entity55 would never have been interrogated about her sex life what happened : the judge allows the defence barrister to question @entity90 's mother about her sex life and the affair her husband @entity56 had with a woman called @entity182 , even though it has no obvious connection to the murder			2
but criminal barrister @entity186 explains : ' the sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed			0
there is no relevance whatsoever			0
' could @entity55 and @entity56 really select their own criminal barrister ? what happened : @entity90 's grieving parents choose retired local lawyer @entity118 as their prosecution barrister			2
but legal expert @entity196 says : ' the whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of @entity202			2
@entity90 's grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life ' they are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim 's family does not get to choose the barrister			2
' witnesses ca n't stay to watch trial what happened : @entity90 's parents @entity55 and @entity56 , along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence			1
but @entity186 says : ' witnesses can not sit through any part of the proceedings , nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part			0
they should never have been in court			0
' how come the new suspect turns up everywhere ? what happened : @entity231 ( @entity232 ) – who is the prime suspect in the @entity234 abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at @entity34			0
but bemused viewers have wondered exactly how @entity231 has been able to track down @entity34 everywhere he goes so easily			0
@entity231 ( @entity232 ) , the prime suspect in the @entity234 abductions , has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere the newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old what happened : those who watched last night 's show criticised a storyline in which new mother @entity104 , played by @entity105 , returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth			2
viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old			0
a one in 7,000 occurrence fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female @entity260 judge , a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel			0
in 2010 , 35 % of barristers were women , and 10 % were from ethnic minorities			0
meanwhile in 2011 , 22 % of judges were women and 5 % were from ethnic minorities			0
that makes the diversity likelihood of the @entity1 trial a one in 7,000 occurrence			0
suddenly more @entity272 fans of the hit television drama @entity1 have complained they are finding it harder to understand @entity35 - because his accent has become ' more @entity272 '			2
the actor , who plays dour detective inspector @entity34 , received wide - spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed @entity7 crime show			2
but now , some vented their frustration on @entity110 suggesting the @entity272 actor is now using a stronger accent			0
table service in @entity51 's viewers accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene - table service from @entity290 's			1
disgruntled fans complained after @entity35 was seen in the latest episode of the show , set in @entity294 , ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table			2
at the @entity300 fast food chain , customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time			1
disgruntled viewers have complained that the latest episode of @entity7 's crime show @entity1 is unrealistic as it shows table service in fast food restaurant @entity42			1

says writer @entity8 ' did his homework ' and consulted legal experts
second series has come under fire for inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes
the actress added : ' it is drama . you ca n't say that it 's right or wrong '
mistakes include table service at @entity290 's where customers order at the till
