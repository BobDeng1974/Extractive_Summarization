by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:54 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:11 est , 13 december 2013 a @entity4 designer has created a thought - provoking video of what a world policed by ‘ security drones ’ might look like			1
@entity10 ’s video , which is set on the streets of @entity12 gives a drone 's - eye view of the city and suggests what sort of security operations the controversial technology might be used for			1
the film , which is called ‘ @entity20 , ’ explores the technology , capability and purpose of drones as he predicts their presence will be ‘ increasingly pervasive in the skies of tomorrow ’			1
‘ in the near future , cities use semi-autonomous drones for urban security			2
human officers monitor drone feeds remotely , and data reports are displayed with a detailed @entity53 ( heads up display ) and communicated via a simulated human voice ( designed to mitigate discomfort with sentient drone technology ) , ’ he explained on @entity45			0
‘ while the drones operate independently , they are “ guided " by the human monitors , who can suggest alternate mission plans and ask questions , ’ he said			0
mr @entity10 said that in the near future , cities will use semi-autonomous drones for urban security			1
human officers will monitor drone feeds remotely and data reports will be compiled about life below ( pictured ) the security drone in the video can analyse traffic density , detect if there is any ‘ malicious intent ’ from drivers , identify specific people in cars and predict criminal activity in certain areas			1
the machine specialises in predictive analysis and the security drones can re-task themselves to investigate potential threats , which raises many questions about whom is in control of whom			0
the security drone in the video can analyse traffic density , detect if there is any ' malicious intent ' from drivers and identify specific people in cars ( pictured ) here , the fictional drone investigates an area where it thinks might be a source of a problem			1
the drone can predict criminal activity in specific areas as the video draws to a close the viewer digests just how much flying robots might be able to glean about the lives of humans below			2
there is also the spectre of a ‘ humans versus drones ’ struggle as the robot encounters ‘ fierce civilian resistance ’			0
while drones are currently used in wars and controlled by human operators , there are plans to roll out the technology in less sinister ways			0
@entity120 has announced plans to deliver packages by drone in the next five years and @entity125 delivery service @entity126 has just conducted a test flight that could one day see medicine flown to hard - to - reach locations using remote - controlled drones			2

@entity10 ’s video , which is set on the streets of @entity12 gives a drone 's - eye view of the city in the future
the film explores the technology , capability and purpose of drones which can read information about *individuals* , **buildings** and traffic far below
the fictional drone can fly above and around **buildings** looking for criminals and identify specific cars and people
