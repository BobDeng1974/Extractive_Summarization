but i have to say to you it 's not a good picture			0
' however , former top referee @entity7 insisted he should have been sent off			0
' had i been refereeing this match , i would have certainly voted @entity91 for a straight red card for @entity0			0
‘ as the pictures show , @entity0 deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of @entity9 – a clear foul and an obvious sending off			1
‘ but if you need further evidence , you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident			2
‘ not only did we have a man representing the red of the @entity105 – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent ’s shirt and that ’s why my card definitely would have been red for @entity113 ’ mr @entity0 tried to present a softer image this morning with a visit to a nursery in @entity117 he was joined by shadow work and pensions secretary @entity119 at @entity121 centre mr @entity0 hopes to use his @entity34 conference speech today to prove to voters that he can be trusted with the economy photographs of the elbowing have been circulated online and appeared on the front pages of several newspapers today			1
