these may look like scenes from a movie set in ancient @entity3 , but this is actually the @entity6 oil wrestling championships in modern - day @entity7			1
wearing only leather trousers and smeared with olive oil , these athletes about to competing in the oldest sports competition in the world			0
the first competition took place near @entity16 in 1362 , when it was the capital of the @entity18 , with most of the competitors being soldiers			0
thousands of fighters gather every year in @entity16 , @entity7 , to take part in the annual @entity23 oil wrestling festival which has been taking place since 1362 around 1,000 fighters , both boys and men , take part in the competition over three days in 12 categories ranked by height rather than weight bouts used to last for days before being decided , but are now limited to 40 minutes with 15 minutes of overtime if a winner is still to be decided in @entity6 a fight is won when one competitor lifts another above his head , or pins the other man to the floor , or when one of the wrestlers collapses today both boys and men of any nationality are allowed to take part in the annual competition , and are trained in the art of oil wrestling by a master - much like martial artists in @entity51			1
the fighters - or @entity53 as they are known - as supposed to uphold the best of @entity7 values , symbolising generosity , honesty , respectfulness and adherence to traditions and customs			1
while oil wrestling existed as far back as the ancient @entity63 , @entity6 is the oldest sanctioned competition still to be running - and holds the @entity65 for the longest running sporting event			1
@entity6 wrestlers , or @entity68 as they are known , train for years for the event under a master - similar to martial artists in @entity51 fighters are allowed to keep the golden belt permanently only if they win three events in a row , which is rare			1
the last time it happened was 16 years ago matches happen simultaneously in a giant grass arena outside of @entity79 , the @entity80 , where the competition has been held for centuries both boys and men are allowed to compete for the event 's prize , the golden belt , which they then get to keep until the following year the festival begins as the golden belt , the prize for the winner , is paraded through the town to the @entity92 where prayers are said before it is taken to @entity94 for the competition			1
thousands of wrestlers , or @entity68 , don traditional kispet trousers , made of either water buffalo or cow leather , before the master of ceremonies announces their names and talents , all in verse			0
the men then compete in 12 different categories , classed by height rather than by weight , across three days in order to be named @entity68			0
before each bout the men smear themselves with olive oil with hundreds of barrels of the slippery liquid being used during the festivities the men compete nude except for a traditional kispet trousers - leather garments that used to be made from water buffalo but these days they are more commonly made from cow leather each of the wrestlers are introduced by the master of ceremonies who recites their names and abilities in verse before the competition begins @entity6 , first fought in 1362 , holds the record for the longest running sports competition in the world ( pictured , a fighter washes himself down after a bout ) matches are held simultaneously on the open grassy field of @entity80			2
the islet of @entity134 , which translates to ' @entity135 , ' used to be the @entity137 's summer palace and was once the private hunting reserve of the @entity18 sultans			0
a bout is decided when a fighter either manages to pin another man to the ground , or manages to lift them up over their shoulders , or when one of the fighters collapses			0
while fights could previously go on for days until a winner was decided , there is now a 40 - minute time limit , with a winner determined by 15 minutes of overtime if there is no clear victor in that time			0
around 1,000 fighters of all ages , nationalities and builds take part in the competition to be named @entity68 boys to men : a group of young oil wrestlers watch their fellow competitors fight from behind a wire fence in @entity7 getting clean : some of the youngest competitors take a shower to wash off the olive oil poured over them during wrestling matches in @entity7 man 's game : fighters are allowed to join the wrestling at a young age , with categories ranked on height			1
they are then trained by a master to improve their wrestling skills the winner is awarded the golden belt which they get to keep until the following year when it is passed over to the next champion			2
a wrestler who manages to retain the title can keep the belt permanently , with another one made for the following year , but this is extremely rare			2
the last fighter to keep a belt was @entity193 , who won his final competition 16 years ago			0
rather than modern synthetic oil , the @entity53 smear themselves with natural olive oil , with over 100 drums of the liquid used during the festival .			2

around 1,000 men and boys compete every year in the @entity6 oil wrestling championships in @entity7
fighters - or @entity53 - compete for top prize of the golden belt when they keep until next year 's *tournament*
they make keep the belt - made partially of real gold - permanently if they win three years in a row
