@entity0 boots to fill @entity1 will never be able to replace @entity2 , but @entity3 and @entity4 can give it a good go			1
@entity6 has championed @entity3 in that role behind the striker , so much so that he sold @entity9 to play him there			1
@entity2 has thrived in that position but @entity3 can , too			1
he is a complete footballer and is tenacious with and without the ball			0
if he plays through the middle expect him to be buzzing all over @entity14			2
his @entity15 team - mate @entity4 could also be involved and whether he plays out wide or through the middle , he will add some serious mileage to this team because he is a real worker			0
it just does not stop			0
as a player it is difficult to raise your head up and out of that and to stay calm , but that is what @entity1 must do			0
whenever the hosts score the overwhelming sensation is relief , but then they can go into panic mode and lose their heads			0
that ’s why they ’ve been scraping through games			0
they could have done with somebody like @entity50 , who has won the @entity51 , in the squad to help settle them			0
the @entity53 have not been brilliant , but they are an excellent tournament team and are well organised			0
if @entity1 play with too much emotion , @entity55 could calmly exploit it			1
@entity57 ready to fill @entity2 's boots passion : @entity1 celebrate @entity61 's goal against @entity25 in @entity62 partisan : @entity1 have been playing with the pressure of an expectant nation efficient : @entity66 scored the only goal as @entity55 beat @entity68 1 - 0 at the @entity69 back to basics against @entity71 in the last 16 , @entity55 looked strangely vulnerable , despite having 23 shots at goal			1
they did not control the game as you would expect but against @entity68 they were much more solid			0
@entity78 was moved back to where he belongs — at full back — and @entity81 replaced @entity82 in the centre to give their backline much more pace			1
that allowed @entity14 to really dominate the midfield from deep , with @entity89 dropping in when needed			2
it was as well as they had played since the opening win against @entity93 , so do n’t be surprised if they line up that way again			0
change : @entity78 has reverted to full back , allowing @entity14 to control the midfield flying full backs i do n't know why @entity100 played @entity101 against @entity25 instead of @entity102			1
in @entity102 and @entity103 , @entity1 have two of the best attacking full backs in the world			1
yes , they can leave gaps behind them but @entity100 should be saying to @entity55 : ‘ we are @entity1 and we ’re going to attack you			2
can you deal with us going forward ? ’ @entity103 has so often provided an outlet for @entity1 but he does need to concentrate			2
i do n’t imagine @entity112 will start on the wing but the @entity53 forward will angle his runs — moving inside then out wide — to get in the space behind @entity103			2
pointing the finger : @entity103 trains with @entity61 at @entity1 's training base in @entity119 on the run : @entity102 trains with the @entity1 team on monday ahead of their semi-final showdown video we 'll cope with @entity126 - @entity20			1

@entity3 will play in his *favoured* role against @entity55 with @entity2 injured
@entity4 will give @entity1 energy to *trouble* @entity53 midfield
@entity1 must not play with too much passion against efficient @entity55
@entity55 have gone back to basics with @entity78 at full back and @entity14 in midfield
@entity103 and @entity102 are among best attacking full backs in the world
