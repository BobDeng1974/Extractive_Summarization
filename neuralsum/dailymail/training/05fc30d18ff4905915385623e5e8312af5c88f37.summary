by @entity0 for most kids having a magician do some tricks , perhaps a clown make everyone laugh or even an outdoor pool party is enough to celebrate their birthday			1
however , children in @entity9 are sharing their special day with aligators at a special pool party			1
the idea was dreamed up by staff at the @entity14 in @entity15 , as part of their zoo to you scheme			1
' @entity52 program is a great venue to talk to people about why we rescue , what these animals need to survive , costs , housing and climate needs ...			2
while showing youngsters , ' said a spokesperson at the zoo			2
@entity14 says : ' the animals have always been in captivity , and do n't know how to hunt for food			2
plus , their mouths are taped shut			2
' ' they 're banded ; they have no strength , ' @entity69 told @entity73 9			2
' they were n't blessed with strength in opening , just in clamping down			2
' although the pool parties are supervised , the idea has angered and caused concern for many @entity69 from the zoo said the practice is safe for kids and beasts , but the @entity85 said the @entity86 should not be transported some of the favorites are an @entity89 alligator and a @entity90 , especially since kids get to swim with them the pool parties help to raise money for the zoo which is a charity they 're also rinsed and bathed before and after an event			1
the water is also tested to make sure it 's not over chlorinated or harmful to the animal			0
' we always have one staff member tending to every animal , ' she said			0
despite the zoo 's best intentions , the response has been met with anger and concern from worried parents and animal lovers			0
' i think you should have a certain responsibility to give these animals a lifestyle that is as close to natural as possible and this does n't seem like that			0
they should be in a sanctuary not a swimming pool with their mouths taped shut , ' said @entity126 of @entity127 , @entity9			1
@entity128 of @entity129 also had similar thoughts : ' i thought what these people were doing for these animals was awesome			0
now after seeing this , they are just exploiting these animals			0
taping their mouths shut to swim with kids is nothing short of animal cruelty			1
i hope all those animals get moved to a real sanctuary with people who 'll only have the animals best interests at heart			0
' others have sprung to the zoos defence saying that children enjoy the experience which is made safe by the zoo 's volunteers			1
while animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits , can take other animals off the property where they 're permitted the zoo says that @entity161 you is the charity 's fun , educational way to bring some animals to children 's birthday parties allowing them to interact and play while educating on the real needs of the animals once the party is over , the animals are returned to the @entity172 in @entity15 , @entity9 in addition to rescuing all kinds of exotic animals , @entity14 also takes animals on the road the @entity178 say that as a charity and animal rescue center they constantly need funding			1
the alligator pool parties are simply are creative way of pulling in much needed cash to the organisation which houses more than 200 animals - many of which would have been destroyed were it not for the zoo 's intervention			1
owner @entity69 said they have reptiles , birds , tortoise and baby donkeys but the favorites are an @entity89 alligator and a @entity90 , especially since kids get to swim with them			0
' it 's an awesome experience , ' ms @entity199 said			0
' the kids have the goggles on and end up floating underneath it , touching it , the kids will swim the way the gators swim and try to race it across the pool			0
' animal sanctuaries with the right paperwork and permits are allowed to take animals off the property where they 're permitted but the rules are less clear about moving @entity89 alligators from one location to another			1
@entity14 says the animals have always been in captivity , and do n't know how to hunt for food			0
plus , their mouths are taped shut they 're also rinsed and bathed before and after an event			1
the water is also tested to make sure it 's not over chlorinated or harmful to the animal			0

@entity230 in @entity15 , @entity9 holds the parties to raise money for their charity
children are supervised throughout the event however some believe it is a form of cruelty to the alligators
