former @entity1 defender @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on club captain @entity3 , branding the striker ' awful ' and calling for him to be dropped after the arrival of @entity6			1
the prolific @entity7 has arrived at @entity8 on a season - long loan deal and @entity0 , who made more than 100 appearances for @entity1 between 1991 and 1996 , believes that should spell the end of @entity3 's time in @entity15 's first team			1
the 50 - year - old also blasted @entity3 's performance in saturday 's lacklustre 0 - 0 draw with @entity19 and questioned why he earns a reported £ 300,000 - a - week			1
there he was at @entity19 this weekend , supposedly captaining the team - but i saw a player interested only in himself , doing nothing to try and lift his game or inspire his team - mates			0
' the only thing in any way remarkable about his performance is that he collects £ 300,000 a week to play that badly			0
' the loan deal for @entity6 has left many pundits coming to the conclusion that @entity46 will drop to bench , leaving @entity3 to play as a no 10 and @entity52 up - front with the club 's latest signing			2
new boy : @entity0 believes @entity3 should be dropped and @entity6 ( pictured ) should start for @entity1 glory days : @entity0 evades a tackle from @entity57 's @entity56 during the 1994 fa cup final at @entity59 frustrated figure : @entity3 has scored just one goal in three @entity63 games so far this season he added : ' once @entity52 is fully - fit again , @entity3 must be the person to be dropped from @entity1 's new attacking line - up : for me , it 'll be @entity28 and @entity6 every time			1
and though there 's lots of talk about him playing in the hole behind that front two , i think that 'd be a huge mistake - why would you have @entity3 there when @entity46 or @entity77 would do the job so much better ? ' @entity3 was made captain by @entity80 over the summer after the departure of @entity82 to @entity83 , but @entity0 feels the @entity84 will not shy away from benching his skipper			2
' that 'll leave @entity80 with a big call to make : dropping @entity3 , ' he wrote			0
' he 's always shown in his career that he 's not afraid of the big decisions ; he showed it most recently with his goalkeeper substitution for the shootout at the @entity93 , and he 'll have to show it once again because the way things are looking there will be no place for @entity3 in that starting line - up soon			0
' @entity100 will be a great captain - @entity80 brave : manager @entity15 will not be afraid to drop @entity3 , according to former @entity102 man @entity0			0

former @entity1 player @entity0 has attacked @entity3
he says the striker was ' awful ' against @entity19 and questions how he earns such vast wages at @entity8
@entity0 also believes @entity3 should be dropped after the arrival of @entity6 on loan from @entity111
@entity15 should play the @entity7 *alongside* @entity28 according to the @entity114 full back
the 50 - year - old thinks @entity46 and @entity77 provide a better *options* in the no 10 role than captain @entity3
