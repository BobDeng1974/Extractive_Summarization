click here for updates on @entity3 ' condition after his injury i never once worried about being hit by a cricket ball			1
it ’s just something that did not cross my mind			0
i even fielded at silly point without a helmet because i felt i could get out of the way should the need arise			1
but the shocking incident involving @entity3 makes me wonder whether i was too @entity14 and blase			1
i had plenty of broken bones , of course , and was once struck a glancing blow on the helmet by @entity20 at @entity21 but you always just thought that you would be out for a few weeks and would then get on with it			2
it was part and parcel of the game and will always be so with such a hard cricket ball			1
warning some pictures and video in this story may be distressing @entity31 sways away from a bouncer during a test against @entity34 at @entity35 in 2003 @entity34 's lightning quick bowler @entity36 has @entity31 in all sorts of trouble with a short ball @entity31 falls to the ground after trying to get out of the way of a @entity20 bouncer the then - @entity44 captain ends up sprawled on his back during the test at @entity21 in 2002 @entity31 ducks out of the way to avoid a short ball you never think about serious injury to yourself even when you see it happen to someone else , like when i was playing for @entity55 at @entity56 against @entity57 and two of @entity60 ’s teeth came flying past me at second slip after he was hit in the face by the dear , late @entity63			1
@entity60 was in a dreadful state , there was blood everywhere , and he needed dental reconstruction work but you think of it as an occupational hazard and thankfully injuries as experienced by @entity3 are extremely unusual			1
this , of course , is a huge shock and everyone ’s thoughts go out to @entity3 , a real fighter who has overcome adversity to be on the brink of a return to the @entity79 test team			1
those fighting qualities have never been needed more			0
spare a thought too for the bowler whose bouncer struck @entity3 , @entity84			1
he will be feeling absolutely terrible but no blame will be attached to him and it was good to see the cricket community rallying round him			2
every cricketer will be checking his safety equipment now and every helmet manufacturer will be looking to see if they can make even more improvements to their product , as they did when @entity95 was hit in the face at @entity97 last summer			1
but the fact is , this is incredibly rare			0
i would say to every young cricketer out there that it is 99.9 per cent certain that something like this will never happen to you			0
there are inherent risks involved in cricket , of course , but they are part of the game			2
@entity3 is hit on the head by @entity84 's delivery at the @entity114 on tuesday the ball goes through @entity95 's grille and injures the @entity44 star during a test against @entity119 last year @entity31 fielding at short leg for @entity44 - with a helmet on - in 2003 every precaution is taken now at youth level to ensure that cricketers have as much protection as they possibly can			1
helmets are compulsory for any hard ball match at schools level and that includes wicketkeepers too , because we saw with @entity132 two years ago that they are not exempt from the risks			2
i do a bit of coaching and one thing i will say is that i will be reminding my players of the need to stay alert in the nets when you are watching or waiting for your turn to bowl			0
being hit at the back of the nets , obviously without any protective equipment , is almost a bigger danger than when you ’re batting			2
it was different when i was a kid			0
i did n’t wear a helmet until i was on the brink of becoming a professional and i was initially uncomfortable with a grille because i was concerned that i could n’t see the ball properly			1
i had a massive gap between my grille and the peak of my helmet and i was so superstitious that i kept the same old lid that would probably have shattered into a million pieces had it truly been struck			2
but i never thought about that			0
go back further and people like @entity165 used to face the likes of @entity167 and @entity168 without a helmet and he would even field at short leg without one			0
can you imagine doing that ? that was one area where i did draw the line			0
if someone like @entity177 , in my day , aimed a slog sweep you wanted to have as much protection on as possible and i always wore a helmet there			0
hussain in 1990 , near the start of his professional career , wearing his helmet with peak and grille miles apart @entity31 gets a tennis ball stuck between his peak and his grille during a demonstration on @entity192 @entity193 will tell you that helmets have been the biggest game changer of the last 40 years because there ’s no doubt they have switched the game more heavily in the batsmen ’s favour and changed techniques			1
even tail - enders stay very much in the line of the ball now			0
but that does n’t mean that truly horrible accidents can not happen and that ’s what we saw at the @entity114			0
at times like this all you can do is hope and pray that @entity3 will pull through			1
the cricket world is thinking of him			0
a helmetless @entity165 ( near left ) is hit in the unmentionables by @entity218 quick @entity168 ( left ) in 1974			0
