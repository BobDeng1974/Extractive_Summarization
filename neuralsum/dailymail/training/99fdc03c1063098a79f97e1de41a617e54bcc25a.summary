by @entity0 solar flares can cause widespread disruption on @entity3 , but scientists have struggled to understand how they are formed			1
now , a team from from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) have taken a huge step forward by recreated the phenomenon that leads to solar flares in a lab. they hope their work could lead to improved space weather forecasts			1
the @entity15 team amanged to recreate plasma loops ( above ) in a lab for the first time			1
the loops are precursors to the massive solar flares on the surface of the sun can cause electrical storms on earth			1
' we 're studying how these solar loops work , which contributes to the knowledge of space weather , ' says @entity30 , professor of applied physics at @entity6 , who compares the research to studying hurricanes			1
' for example , you ca n't predict a hurricane unless you know more about the events that precede it , like high - pressure and low - pressure fronts			2
' the same is true for solar flares			1
' the team hope their work could lead to improved warnings of solar storms			1
' it takes some time for the plasma to get to @entity3 from the sun , so it 's possible that with more research , we could have up to a two - day warning period for massive solar flares , ' said professor @entity30			1
the laboratory plasma loop studies were conducted by graduate student @entity56 together with @entity30 and are reported in the august 13 issue of the journal @entity59			2
a strong @entity61 solar flare captured by the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			1
@entity64 's @entity63 estimated that it traveled at over 630 miles per second , causing geomagnetic storms on earth inside a vacuum chamber , electromagnets create an arched magnetic field			1
then , hydrogen and nitrogen gas is released at the two footpoints of the arch. finally , a high - voltage electrical current is applied at the footpoints to ionize the gas and turn it into plasma , which travels at a minimum speed of about six miles per second			2
they found that two magnetic forces control the behavior of arching loops of plasma , which is hot , ionized gas			2
' one force expands the arch radius and so lengthens the loop while the other continuously injects plasma from both ends into the loop , ' @entity30 said			0
' this latter force injects just the right amount of plasma to keep the density in the loop constant as it lengthens			0
' the duo says that in simpler terms , this process is like squeezing toothpaste into a tube from both ends , except that the toothpaste has little magnets in it , so there are magnetic forces acting internally			0
@entity56 and @entity30 studied plasma loops that they generated with a pulse - powered , magnetized plasma gun			0
' all three steps — the magnetic field , and the gas , and the high voltage — happen in just a flash of light inside the chamber , " says @entity56			0
' we use high - speed cameras with optical filters to capture the behavior of the plasmas			0
" by color - coding the inflowing plasma , the optical filters vividly demonstrated the flow from the two ends of the loop			0
according to @entity30 , no one has ever used this technique before			0
on camera , red plasma flows into the loop from one footpoint while blue plasma simultaneously flows into the loop from the other end			0
the @entity134 unleasheing a solar flare , which could affect power grids on @entity3 , as seen by @entity64 's @entity62 ( @entity62 ) ' for each experiment , you 'll only see the light from the hydrogen side or the nitrogen side in the images , " explains @entity56			1
' but these experiments are very reproducible , so we can put separate images on top of each other to see both plasmas in one picture			0
' next , @entity30 's lab will test how two loops interact with each other			0
' we want to see if they can merge and form one big loop , ' says @entity30			0
' some people believe that this is how larger plasma loops on the sun are formed			2

team hope to learn more about how flares that can disrupt electricity on earth are formed
