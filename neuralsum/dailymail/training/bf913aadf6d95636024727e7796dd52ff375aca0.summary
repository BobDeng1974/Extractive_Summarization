by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 04:47 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 05:32 est , 27 march 2012 conspiracy : @entity3 has been urged to probe speculation that @entity5 was poisoned the @entity6 has asked @entity3 to probe the sudden death of a briton who had close links to a controversial high - ranking @entity11 official			1
@entity5 , 41 , died last november and @entity3 officials claimed his death was caused by excessive drinking			1
but his concerned friends and other members of the @entity18 community in the south western metropolis of @entity20 fear he may have been deliberately poisoned			1
' members of the expat community became suspicious about mr @entity5 ’s death in @entity20 and contacted @entity18 consular staff			0
' there were also numerous rumours , and because of the concern and repeated speculation , we recently asked the @entity3 authorities to look into the case , ' a @entity6 spokesman told the @entity33			0
mr @entity5 was described today by ' shocked ' acquaintances as a near tee totaller and in good health			1
mr @entity5 had a strong business relationship with @entity20 party secretary @entity38 and his family for over a decade			2
mr @entity38 was a rising political star tipped for a leadership place - but he was sensationally purged earlier this month in a scandal that has shaken the ruling @entity11			2
mr @entity5 , whose official @entity3 medical records claim he died from ' excessive alcohol consumption ' , also had a business relationship with mr @entity38 ’s wife , @entity45			1
believed to have been married to @entity3 national , mr @entity5 was cremated in @entity20			2
accusations : @entity38 , centre , is said to have used his anti-corruption campaign to attack business rivals of his wife @entity45 , left his family and @entity18 consular staff said at the time they were satisfied with the @entity3 coroner ’s initial findings			2
but countless rumours and speculation , fuelled by @entity3 online whistle blowers , claimed his death is linked to his professional relationship with the @entity52			0
mr @entity38 was purged two weeks ago , reportedly for trying to stop a criminal investigation involving his wife - a probe ordered by his former police chief and right hand man , @entity68			2
together , mr @entity38 and mr @entity68 became popular for a mafia - busting crusade to clean up the @entity20 city - municipality - which has a population of 32 million - of corrupt officials and business chiefs colluding with gangsters			1
but mr @entity68 fled to the @entity76 consulate in nearby @entity77 in early february after mr @entity38 reacted angrily to his investigation involving his wife , it has since been claimed			0
favours : mr @entity5 is said to have helped the @entity83 ' secure top @entity18 public school berths for their son , @entity84 , centre access : mr @entity38 's son @entity88 , seen here on the right with action movie star @entity91 , left , won places at @entity93 and @entity94 prestigious : mr @entity5 's exact involvement in getting @entity84 , centre , into the top education institutions has not yet been confirmed dismissed @entity20 party chief @entity38 had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among @entity3 's elite			1
but now a very different picture of his mafia - busting initiative — called da hei , or smash black — is emerging , since mr. @entity38 was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief @entity68			1
critics called his clampdown , launched in 2009 , the ' red terror ' , saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity : framing victims , extracting confessions through torture , extorting business empires and visiting retribution on mr @entity38 's political rivals			1
@entity119 , an analyst of the @entity3 leadership at the @entity121 , told the @entity122 : ‘ even by @entity11 standards , this is unacceptable			0
’ he added : ‘ this is red terror			0
’ in 10 months , 4,781 people were arrested , including business executives , police officers , judges , legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates , according to the @entity122			0
@entity20 ’s top justice official was even found to have buried $ 3 million under a fish pond , during the crackdown			0
he became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed			0
but mr @entity38 's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer , police chief @entity68 last month sought refuge in a @entity76 consulate			1
he apparently feared for his safety after telling mr @entity38 that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a @entity18 citizen , @entity5 , who was an acquaintance of mr @entity38 ’s family			1
mr @entity68 asked @entity76 diplomats for asylum but was coaxed out of the consulate after 12 hours by @entity3 security officials and flown under guard to @entity1 where he is being held in a secure government compound			0
speculation is rife that the investigation into mr @entity38 ’s wife , which took place shortly after mr @entity5 ’s death , led to mr @entity68 ’s attempted flight to the @entity76 his failed escape bid brought down his boss who was destined for a seat on the all powerful @entity162 in the autumn			1
it is understood mr @entity5 helped arrange business meetings with mr @entity38 when he was a government minister in the @entity166 in the capital , @entity1			2
it is also claimed mr @entity5 helped the @entity83 ’ secure top @entity18 public school berths for their son , @entity84 , who studied at @entity93 and @entity94 , though this can not be confirmed			1
mr @entity38 is the ' princeling ' son of a celebrated communist revolutionary			0
his crime - busting policies and calls for a return to chairman @entity178 ’s socialist ' red ' culture caused upset among modernisers in @entity1 , with many claiming he used his anti-corruption dragnet to lock up political opponents			0
however , his hardline policies found support among the @entity3 public who are angry at the widening rich - poor gap			0
mr @entity68 ’s dash to the @entity76 embassy caused extreme embarrassment for @entity1 , however - more so as the party was preparing to stage its annual @entity191 ahead of the once in a decade change of leadership , which takes place later in the autumn			0
last week , reports of an attempted coup inside the secure government compound in @entity1 made headlines , with claims that mr @entity38 ’s supporters - among them nationalistic @entity203 generals - were battling it out with @entity11 modernisers , including @entity3 president in waiting , @entity207 , who moved to sack him			1
' i am not aware of this case , ' a @entity209 spokesman in @entity1 said			0
power : @entity3 paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the @entity11 provincial head office in @entity20 which was the office of @entity38 purged : @entity38 , secretary of chongqing @entity216 of the @entity11 of @entity3 , led a major crackdown on organised crime amoung the country 's business leaders and ruling elite			2
