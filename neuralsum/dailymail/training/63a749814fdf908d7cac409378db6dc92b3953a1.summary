the man who completed the world ’s most difficult climb this week , came up with the idea for the feat to move on from the ‘ deep pain ’ of divorcing his first wife			1
@entity7 can reveal that @entity8 decided to scale the 3,000ft @entity9 in @entity10 to ‘ escape ’ from the agony of splitting with @entity13 , a fellow climber and his teenage sweetheart			1
@entity8 did not think he could do it but after meeting the woman who would become his second wife he fell in love again and decided that it ‘ just might be possible			1
she revealed that the split from his first wife had inspired his climb @entity8 and his ex-wife @entity13 pose for a photo during an interview in 2002 about their harrowing experience as captives in @entity35 two years previously new love : @entity8 and his second wife @entity37 , and their son @entity38			1
@entity37 says he was inspired to climb @entity9 to get over the pain of his first marriage ending this week , eight years after he initially had the idea , @entity8 and @entity43 became the first people ever to climb @entity9 ’s @entity25 using just their hands and feet			1
the pair endured split fingertips , holes in their hands and had the skin ripped off their digits so many times they had to get up every four hours in the night to apply balm			0
in interviews afterwards @entity8 , 36 , said that he wanted to ‘ explore the limits of what was possible ’ and that it drove him for several years			2
but in reality the driving force was the pain of breaking up with his teenage sweetheart , according to his second wife , photographer @entity26 , 29			1
on their shared blog she wrote : ‘ i ca n't even begin to understand and explain what has all led up to this moment			0
‘ the @entity66 started out as a little bit of an escape from a deep pain @entity70 felt from the sadness of splitting up with his former wife			2
‘ he deemed the wall impossible to free climb			1
‘ he came back to it a year later , and with the excitement of a budding relationship between us decided that @entity81 just might be possible			2
‘ our relationship began with this route , and @entity81 has weaved its way through our lives together over the past 6 years			0
’ @entity8 and @entity13 , 34 , were seen as the perfect @entity87 climbing couple while they were together			1
they met at a junior climbing competition in 1995 when they were in their teens and their careers were only just beginning			0
their lives revolved around climbing 24 hours a day and they once spent @entity96 , an extremely difficult 70 - foot crack at @entity98 in @entity10			2
another time they spent 18 days rafting along the @entity100 in search of climbable rocks			0
they even had their own website , @entity105 , but it is now inactive			0
conquered : the rock formation @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity108			1
its @entity25 had never been free climbed - until now together : @entity26 was on hand to greet both climbers at the top of @entity9 when they completed ' the most difficult climb in the world ' rock on : @entity8 and @entity43 set up camp as they begin their epic climb determined : @entity8 , top , climbs @entity118 with @entity43 handling the line in 2000 , while he was attempting to scale a sheer face in the @entity122 mountains in @entity35 with @entity13 and three other climbers , four terrorists from the @entity124 , a group linked to @entity125 , began spraying them with bullets			1
fearing that they were just seconds from being killed , they abseiled down to the ground			0
six days of hell followed as the gunmen moved them from place to place , with little food or water			0
that ordeal also helped inspire to to accomplish the recent feat. @entity8 and @entity13 got married in 2003 by which time she had become the second woman to make a free ascent of @entity9			1
she was also part of the first all - female ascent of @entity145 's @entity144 in 1999 and soon became established as one of the world ’s most successful female climbers			2
around the time she and @entity8 split , she suffered debilitating injuries to her shoulder and finger while bouldering in @entity10			1
it put her out of climbing for a year and forced her to refocus her life			0
in an interview with climbing blog @entity156 she later said : ‘ after going through a divorce and almost 4 solid years of injuries during that time , i ’ve come to appreciate just being able to go climbing at all			0
‘ not being able to use climbing as an outlet and escape was quite difficult and in the end made me appreciate going climbing in any capacity so much more			0
’ in the same piece she described @entity8 as ‘ by far the most influential person in my climbing , hands down ’			2
@entity8 , 36 , from @entity167 , @entity168 , had started climbing at three and became a national climbing champion at 16			2
he accidentally sawed off his left index finger and when doctors reattached it and told him he could never climb again , he asked that they remove it once more so he could go back to what he loved doing			0
happily remarried : @entity13 , @entity8 's first wife , has married and had a son			1
she climbed until she was nine months pregnangt @entity176 to climb : @entity26 revealed that his determination to climb @entity9 came from @entity8 dealing with the ' deep pain ' of the split from his first wife @entity182 recently called @entity8 ‘ arguably the best all - around rock climber on the planet ’			1
in 2000 while on a trip to @entity35 's @entity187 , @entity13 and the group they were with were kidnapped by @entity124 militants who held them hostage for six nights			1
they escaped when @entity8 shoved their guard off a ledge to his death and they climbed 18 miles to freedom			0
@entity13 is now remarried to @entity198 , 42 , also a climber , and lives in @entity10 and @entity201 , @entity108			1
last july they had a son , @entity203 , and @entity13 wrote on her blog how she climbed right up until she gave birth			2
she wrote : ‘ if there ’s anything i ’ve learned over the last year , it ’s that all forms are always changing , evolving and growing			0
‘ it ’s the nature of life			0
instead of fighting this reality , it ’s much better to accept it , even appreciate it			0
i try to remind myself of this , but it 's hard , i can be quite stubborn			0
’ @entity8 and @entity26 have a son , @entity38 , two , and on his @entity219 page writes how he is happier than ever			1
@entity43 grips the surface of a razor - sharp edge as he makes his way up the 3000ft @entity9 people watch as the two climbers ascend the ' @entity66 ' last july next to a picture of his wife and baby he wrote : ‘ 4 years ago today my life was forever changed in the best way possible			1
thanks for making every moment feel like magic			0
’ in one interview he added that his son ’s birth ‘ has made me much more responsible and intentional because i want to set a good example ’			0
@entity8 and @entity43 ’s ascent of the @entity66 , which lasted 19 days and began on december 27 , is already being hailed as one of the greatest climbs ever by mankind			1
the granite rock is smooth as a bedroom wall and the only ledges the men could grab were as sharp as razors and the size of a matchstick			0
then there was the sheer height of the rock : @entity9 is the height of three @entity254 stacked on top one another , or 17 @entity256			0
after they reached the summit president @entity257 tweeted a picture of @entity9 with the caption that he was ‘ so proud ’ of the two men as they ‘ remind us that anything is possible ’			1
a woman who answered the phone at @entity13 ’s home in @entity10 told @entity268 : ‘ maybe you could try back in a bit , ' and hung up			2
happy to be home : @entity8 and @entity13 speaking to the media after their ordeal in 2000 dangerous territory : @entity8 , his then girlfriend @entity13 , and two other climbers , were kidnapped while climbing in the @entity122 mountain range			2
