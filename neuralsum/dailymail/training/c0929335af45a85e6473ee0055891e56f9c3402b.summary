150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the @entity9 , pictured , in @entity11 a @entity23 source told @entity24 : ‘ we ’re used to fuel being stolen from farms by rural criminals but this is quite a step further			1
two men have been detained in the @entity31 area with a large amount of illicit fuel but at this stage we do n’t know if the two incidents are linked			0
’ the theft was from the @entity38 pipeline , which carries fuel from the @entity40 near @entity41 to the @entity42			2
using a technique more common in @entity45 , the thieves dug down about 8ft to get to the pipeline , then drilled a small hole in it			1
they connected a hose to the pipe which they ran to a road nearby and then covered with soil			0
after putting a tap on the end of the hose and covering their tracks , it is believed they returned at night to fill containers			0
the pipeline alternates between carrying petrol and diesel fuel			0
about 150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the @entity9 , just upstream from top public school @entity10 , pictured , in @entity11 but three weeks ago a plough tore the illicit hose from its shallow trench and ripped it out of the pipeline , causing the leak			1
@entity71 , who operates a trout farm on the river , said : ‘ the big fear is that this fuel will get into the river and destroy the food chain			0
’ @entity15 is leading the efforts to contain the spill and is drilling at the site to try to discover what is happening to the fuel beneath the surface			2
however it is unclear whether it will be washed into the river or sink into the chalk below			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it ’s very unfortunate and technical work is going on to try to establish whether this will affect the water table and the river			0
’ @entity95 , spokeswoman for environmental group action for the @entity9 , said : ‘ it is worrying and we hope the river wo n’t be badly impacted but no one can predict where the fuel will end up			2
