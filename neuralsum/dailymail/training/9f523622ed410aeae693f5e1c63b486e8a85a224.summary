by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 21:19 est , 18 february 2014 a @entity4 university student has been condemned to death after he was found guilty of fatally poisoning his roommate with drinking water			1
@entity8 , 27 , claimed that the death of @entity10 , also 27 , was an accident after an innocent @entity13 prank which had ended in tragedy			1
however , a judge sitting at @entity16 ruled that the act was malicious and @entity8 had intentionally murdered his roommate out of spite			0
trial : april fool killer @entity8 , pictured centre , gets the death sentence for poisoning drinking water that killed his university roommate mr @entity10 drank water from a spiked dispenser at a prestigious @entity27 university on april 1 last year but did not die until april 16 of liver , kidney and lung failure according to the @entity32 's @entity31			1
a post-mortem revealed that he had been poisoned with the toxic chemical @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , which @entity8 had taken from the @entity27 hospital laboratory where he was an intern			1
at trial in november , the defendant confessed to poisoning the water , but stated he never intended to kill mr @entity10			0
the @entity40 reported that prosecutors rejected @entity8 's argument by claiming he was familiar with the chemical he put in the water as he had used it in experiments on laboratory animals and therefore knew what he was doing			1
' the defendant @entity8 committed intentional homicide by poisoning due to trivialities			2
the method was ruthless , the harm to society was great , the crime extremely serious , ' the court said in a statement			0
homicide : a photo of murdered student @entity10 where his classmates raise funds for him at @entity62 prosecutors added that @entity8 killed mr @entity10 in an intentional homicide because of a grudge he held against over " trivial daily matters			2
" it was also claimed that mr @entity10 often described @entity8 as " stingy , " and once criticising their other roommate 's bad behaviour to @entity8 's , which angered the @entity72 murderer			1
@entity8 's lawyers argued against any intention , claiming " trivial daily matters " were not enough for @entity8 to commit the murder and he would have used a different chemical if there was intention to kill due to @entity35 's strong odour			2
@entity8 stated he was prompted to do prank after mr @entity10 announced his own plans to trick someone on @entity13 , but he only wanted to cause mr @entity10 some discomfort			2
but @entity8 's understanding of @entity35 is extensive and he has published several articles with descriptions of experiments with the chemical in national academic journals , including measuring lethal volumes in mice			2
creating a killer dose , @entity8 put at least 30 grams - 10 times the fatal does for an adult man of mr @entity10 's size - of the chemical in the water dispensers on march 31 at about 5.50pm			1
prosecutors said @entity8 had taken the chemical from an experiment at the hospital on the same day			0
@entity35 is primarily used for research and according to the @entity103 exposure in humans may cause liver damage and affect the blood			0
after drinking the toxic water on @entity13 , mr @entity10 was hospitalised the next say and transferred to intensive care the following day with liver failure , plunging blood platelets and fever			0
distraught : @entity114 , mother of victim @entity10 , is hysterical after leaving @entity16 after doing an ultrasonic examination on mr @entity10 on the morning of april 2 , @entity8 told him there was nothing wrong with his liver and he even visited mr @entity10 in hospital and prosecutors used this to blame @entity8 for doing nothing to save mr @entity10 's life			1
with his condition remaining undiagnosed for eight days after drinking the chemical , @entity8 's other roommate , @entity125 , not a resident in the dorm at the time , remembered @entity8 had written articles about the chemical			1
when police found the chemical in the water dispenser and arrested @entity8 , he confessed			0
police also found @entity8 had searched murder cases involving fatal doses on his laptop from april 1 to april 4			0
the court said @entity8 could appeal the sentence and @entity4 's top court must review death sentences before execution can take place			1
the crime has been compared to a 1994 case that saw a student at @entity148 in @entity149 allegedly poisoned with thallium , a toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons , by classmate @entity154 while the two were studying chemistry			0
the victim , @entity157 , survived the poisoning but lives severe brain damage as a result			0
@entity161 reported that at almost 40 years old , @entity157 remains mostly bed - ridden , practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6 - year - old child , despite previously being a keen swimmer and skilled musician			0
despite being suspected of the poisoning , @entity166 , who has family connections with @entity4 officials , was never tried and now lives abroad			0
