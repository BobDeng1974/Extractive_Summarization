by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:30 pm on 28th july 2011 the world 's population looks set to smash through the seven billion this year - an increase of one billion in just a decade			1
findings also reveal that by 2050 the world 's population will swell to over nine billion			2
the 10 billion mark is expected to be passed by 2100 , although depending on birth rates the population could be as high as 15.8 billion at the start of the @entity11			1
' they also claim that almost all ( 97 per cent ) of the projected 2.3 billion increase in population will occur in less developed regions , with nearly half [ 49 per cent ] in @entity33			1
by contrast , the populations of developed countries such as the @entity16 and @entity17 will remain flat , but will age , with fewer adults of working age to support those who have retired and are living on pensions			1
countries and areas classified by fertility level - large swathes of @entity33 have a high fertility level but most of @entity43 is low while the world 's population took until 1800 to reach one billion , it has grown rapidly in the past two centuries , swelling from three to seven billion in the last half century alone			1
in 2011 135 million people are predicted to be born , while 57 million will die - a net increase of 78 million people			0
there is some debate over how accurate the projections are , with changes in birth rates meaning that by 2050 the population could be two billion lower than predicted , at eight billion , and by 2100 it could be as low as 6.2 billion , or as high as 15.8 billion			2
experts claim that almost all ( 97 per cent ) of the projected 2.3 billion increase in population will occur in less developed regions , with nearly half in @entity33 study author professor @entity64 , from the department of economics and demographics at @entity63 , said : ' although the issues immediately confronting developing countries are different from those facing the rich countries , in a globalized world demographic challenges anywhere are demographic challenges everywhere			1
' the world 's population has grown slowly for most of human history			0
it took until 1800 for the population to hit 1 billion			0
' however , in the past half - century , population jumped from 3 to 7 million			2
' in 2011 , approximately 135 million people will be born and 57 million will die , a net increase of 78 million people			0
considerable uncertainty about these projections remains			0
population for countries grouped by fertility level 1950 - 2100 ' depending on whether the number of births per woman continues to decline , the ranges for 2050 vary from 8.1 to 10.6 billion , and the 2100 projections vary from 6.2 to 15.8 billion			1
' prof @entity64 , whose teams ' results are printed in journal @entity91 added : ' population trends indicate a shift in the ' demographic centre of gravity ' from more to less developed regions			1
' already strained , many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food , water , housing , and energy to their growing populations , with repercussions for health , security , and economic growth			2
' he concluded : ' the demographic picture is indeed complex , and poses some formidable challenges			0
' those challenges are not insurmountable , but we can not deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand			0
' we have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge - action gaps we see in the area of child survival , to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy			0
' it 's just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change			0

population expected to reach *10billion* by 2100
experts say almost all the growth will occur in less developed regions like @entity33
population in developed countries like @entity16 to remain flat - but will age
