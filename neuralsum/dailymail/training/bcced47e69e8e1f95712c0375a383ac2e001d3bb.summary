by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:19 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 15 january 2013 @entity4 chief sir @entity2 said bankers had to realise they ' can ¿ t just exist on their own ' @entity6 has abandoned plans to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate			1
the u-turn came hours after @entity4 boss sir @entity2 branded the idea ' depressing ' and accused bankers of mis - judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash			1
the investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years , due to pay out this month , until after april 6			1
it would mean tax on the payouts would have been paid at the 45p rate instead of the 50p rate for high earners			1
but people familiar with the bank 's deliberations said the @entity28 of the board met today and ruled out the idea			0
in a devastating attack on attitudes in the @entity34 , sir @entity2 accused the super-rich of thinking it was ' exciting ' to use a loophole which could cost the taxpayer millions			1
' i find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think it 's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run to a very great extent , ' he told the @entity51			1
sir @entity2 , who will stand down as @entity4 governor in june , said @entity34 firms had to consider the reputational damage the move would cause			1
' i think it would be rather clumsy and rather lacking in care and attention to how other people might react and , in the long run , financial institutions , like all large institutions do depend on good will from the rest of society , they ca n’t just exist on their own			0
' @entity68 taxpayers could lose out on millions of pounds if super-rich bankers press ahead with the idea of delaying their bonuses until after the 50p tax rate is scrapped			1
chancellor @entity73 came under pressure to take action to close the loophole which could lead to a massive shortfall in @entity51 coffers			2
the revelation will add to the sense of public fury after it emerged bankers at the firm are expected to reward themselves £ 8.3 billion in bonuses tomorrow			1
staggering : bankers at @entity6 are expected to share £ 8.3billion in bonuses @entity88 treasury minister @entity87 said : ' @entity6 has made the right decision , but the fact remains that from april thousands of bankers and millionaires will get a huge tax cut from @entity94 and @entity73			1
' the @entity96 investment bank , which employs 5,500 staff in the @entity68 , will be the first to unveil its telephone number - sized rewards – an average of £ 250,000 a person – as part of the latest round of bonus updates			1
the increase , up from £ 230,000 last year , comes as @entity68 families are still struggling to make ends meet five years after banks brought the economy to the brink of meltdown			0
about half of the top 20 banks in the @entity34 had considered delaying @entity68 payouts , the @entity112 reported			1
in 2010 bankers brought forward their bonuses by a few weeks ahead of the introduction of the 50p rate for people earning more than £ 150,000 , costing the taxpayer £ 16billion			1
chancellor @entity73 will be urged to act to stop bankers avoiding tax by delaying their big bonuses until after april 6 by delaying a bonus until after april 6 , a banker with a salary of £ 150,000 awarded a £ 100,000 bonus would save £ 5,000 in tax			1
@entity130 mp @entity129 said any bank caught dodging tax in this way should be banned from being awarded lucrative government contracts			2
calls for restraint by politicians , who have used taxpayers cash to bailout many of the banks , have fallen on deaf ears			0
at taxpayer - backed @entity144 , which is expected to make a loss this year , its boss is likely to be entitled to a multimillion - pound bonus			0
some of the reward for chief executive @entity148 is linked to the share price , which has doubled , and customer satisfaction , which means he could be in line for a £ 4.4 million fortune			0
but most of the anger will be directed at @entity6 whose vice chairman said back in 2009 ‘ inequality is a way of achieving greater opportunity and prosperity for all ’			2
the comments by @entity163 echoed those of fictional banker @entity165 in the film @entity167 - whose mantra ‘ greed is good ’ came to sum up the excesses of the 1980s			0
@entity163 was of the view that taxpayers should ‘ tolerate the inequality ’ and insisted banks should not be ashamed of rewarding staff			0
true to this ethos @entity178 is likely to have boosted its salary and bonus pot to £ 8.3 billion from £ 7.6 billion the previous year due to increased profits			2
the last three months have been strong with share trading and bonds performing well			0
global profit could top £ 3.79 billion up from £ 2.73 billion			0
the lavish windfalls come as new research shows pay rewards are failing to incentivise @entity68 ’s big bosses to improve the long term success of their businesses			0
' prosperity for all ' : the @entity96 bank ( @entity194 offices pictured ) employs 5,500 staff in the @entity68 and will be the first to unveil its massive rewards executive pay packages across @entity68 ’s biggest firms are ‘ overwhelmingly ’ linked to short - term financial measures such as earnings and share price movement , according to research from the @entity204 lobby group			2
however it shows chief executive pay has trebled to £ 4.8million , on average , in ten years without any accompanying long - term increase in share values			0
at @entity144 , the bank has experienced a short term stock rise , but given the political tensions over banking bonuses , the @entity144 directors may decide not to pay the full amount to the @entity216 banker , who last year waived his bonus following a prolonged period of sick leave			2
@entity144 shares were the second best performing of @entity223 ’s banks last year and closed last week at 54p , up from 25.5p in may			0
but the bank is still expected to make a full year loss of about £ 1.4 billion , as it continues to suffer from bad debts from corporate loans and a big bill over the mis - selling of payment protection insurance			2
the 40 per cent state - owned lender was pushed to a £ 144 million loss in the three months to 30 september , as it took an additional £ 1 billion charge for dealing with the scandal , taking its total to £ 5.3 billion			0
@entity144 froze basic pay for 500 senior staff for the third year in a row on friday .			0

bank governor accused bankers of thinking they ' exist on their own '
warns the @entity34 of further reputational damage if bonuses are delayed
@entity6 will be first to unveil its rewards worth £ 8.3billion
50p tax rate for anyone earning over £ 150,000 cut to 45p from april 6
delaying bonus payouts until *mid-april* would cost the @entity51 millions
