a state prosecutor in @entity1 has come under fire after offensive posts dating back months were found on his personal @entity5 account			1
@entity6 wrote about ' crack hoes ' should get their ' tubes tied ' , how a young man who broke into a @entity1 home deserved to be killed by the homeowner , and how @entity14 @entity13 was an example of the dangers of affirmative action			1
the @entity19 - based prosecutor has not publicly commented since the offensive posts were revealed but his boss , the state attorney , has put out a statement hinting at their veracity			2
under fire : @entity6 , who is believed to be 47 , wrote controversial statements on his @entity5 account but likely wo n't face any blowback from his job because of the @entity30 offensive : @entity6 posted this rude note earlier this month and still has not taken it down outrageous : @entity6 did not let his role as a lawyer and a state 's attorney stop him from criticizing one of the country 's highest judges @entity6 , who is married and believed to have at least one teenage son , does not seem bothered by the attention and his profile remains publicly open in spite of the scrutiny			1
weighing in on cases : ' @entity46 ' laws are particularly sensitive in @entity1 but that did n't stop him from speaking definitively on a new case @entity49 reported that he has taken down at least one post- but it was not an offensive one : he posted a link to a local news story about his @entity5 musings with the caption ' apparently a slow news day in @entity57 ' on wednesday but it is no longer visible on his profile			1
a collection of offensive posts remain , however			0
one of the most controversial came two weeks ago on @entity61 , when he took aim at women who he believes are neglecting their children			0
' @entity61 to all the crack hoes out there			0
it ' [ sic ] never too late to turn it around , tie our tubes , clean up your life and make a difference to someone out there that deserves a better mother , ' the post read			0
another of his posts attacks women , but this time taking aim at one of the most respected in the country : @entity14 @entity13			1
on may 3 , he posted a photo of @entity13 and wrote the following caption : ' reason enough why no country should ever engage in the practice of @entity91 again			2
this could be the result			0
where would she be if she did n't hit the quota lottery ? here 's a hint : " would you like to supersize that sir ? " ' as if that did not get enough attention , he shared it with his 220 friends again three days later			0
@entity6 , who is believe to be 47 years old , regularly shares links to news stories and adds his take on the story in the caption			2
hot topic : @entity109 was the special prosecutor for the @entity111 case and was the one to push for a murder charge , which some cited as a reason why @entity115 was found not guilty in action : @entity6 works as a state prosecutor in @entity19 and regularly tries murder cases one example of that came in january when he shared a report about a then - 19 - year - old who was arrested for attempted robbery and was restrained by the homeowners with a taser and ' brute force ' until police arrived			1
' they should have shot him in the head , anyone that invades another home in a violent manner should be executed on the spot , ' @entity6 wrote			2
self defense and @entity46 issues are particularly sensative issues in @entity1 especially in light of the @entity111 shooting			0
@entity6 , who is employed by the state 's attorney 's office , did n't hold back from commenting on that case either , writing at one point that he thought @entity1 residents should be calling for the resignation of @entity109 , the special prosecutor in the @entity115 case			1
non-denial : he has not spoken publicly since the news broke but his office condemned his posts , making it clear that they were true free speech : @entity6 regularly posted about people 's right to free speech - even citing @entity156 and those who were outraged over homosexual @entity159 recruit @entity158 's kiss as examples in spite of the controversial statements , it does not appear that @entity6 will face and formal reprimands as his supervisor already put out a statement both condemning and protecting @entity6 ' statements			1
' i do not agree with the political sentiments expressed by ( @entity6 ) and i find some of the words he chose to be both offensive and dehumanizing			0
political speech is protected by the first amendment of the @entity174 and i do not police the private thoughts , views , or expressions of those in my employ , ' state attorney @entity171 said in a statement to local station @entity181 .			0

@entity6 made controversial statements on his @entity5 profile but is not facing any formal reprimand from his office
@entity6 , who is married and believed to have a teenage son , is a state prosecutor and regularly tries murder cases
his role did n't stop him from *bashing* @entity14 @entity13 as a *recipient* of affirmative action
he also weighed in on the @entity115 trial saying that special prosecutor @entity109 should resign
