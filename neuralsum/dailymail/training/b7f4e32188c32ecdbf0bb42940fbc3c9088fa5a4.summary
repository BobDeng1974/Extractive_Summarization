by @entity0 a @entity1 hailed as the world 's greatest living fisherman has vowed to turn into a real - life ' @entity7 ' hero - and stop a great white shark that is heading towards @entity6			1
@entity9 has caught dozens of sharks , including the infamous great white , during a lifetime of extreme fishing all over the world			1
and the 70 - year - old , from @entity16 , @entity17 , is now preparing to turn into the real - life version of the shark hunter played by @entity20 in the film ' @entity7 '			1
the massive shark - called @entity30 - is currently being tracked by scientists in the @entity42 who have attached gps devices to its back to record its movements			2
experts have been following the 15ft beast , who weights 2,000lbs , for over a year as part of a ground - breaking ocean life study and her progress can be followed on their website			1
the shark appears to be making her way across the @entity56 towards the @entity6 coastline and mr @entity9 is the perfect man to meet her			1
the grandfather - of - five holds a string of world records after spending decades chasing fish across the globe			2
he said : ' i 've caught @entity65 in the past - they 're very strong and are good fighters so i 'd expect to battle with it for a few hours before catching it			2
' i know i 'm no spring chicken but i 'm confident i could take it on - it would be like fighting a miniature bull but i 've got all the experience behind me to do it			0
' when you 're out there battling with a shark you do n't have time to get scared - it 's man versus monster but adrenaline will keep me going			0
' you just have to pace yourself and try and forget about the pain - it 's mind over matter			0
' he has been compared to ' @entity86 ' , the shark hunter played by @entity20 , who famously sings ' @entity84 in @entity88 classic @entity7			0
extreme fisherman mr @entity9 landed a different @entity65 - which weighed in at 1300lb - off the coast of @entity90 in 2000 pensioner mr @entity9 has amassed a house full of trophies in a lifetime of extreme fishing @entity20 ( left ) as famous shark - hunter ' quint ' in @entity7 , with @entity96 playing police chief @entity97 ( centre ) and @entity99 playing @entity97 ( right ) mr @entity9 says he would use ' rubby dubby ' to tempt @entity30 in - a practice of luring fish by leaving mashed up fish guts in a trail behind the boat			1
he will then use a 130lbs line with a 50lbs clasp to hook the shark while standing on a 20ft catamaran			0
mr @entity9 , who lives with wife @entity110 , 63 , at a holiday fishing complex , normally uses a ' fighting chair ' - like that used by @entity86 in @entity7 but says he will be tackling this shark standing up			1
he said : ' i would have to capture the shark standing up as there are no ' fighting chairs ' available which makes the catch it a lot more tiring			0
' the chair has a rod hold and a harness so it 's much easier and there 's no need to stand up , but they 're very expensive and i 'm not aware of anyone who has one in the @entity6			2
' though i 'd have two skippers on board i would n't have any help catching the shark as i have too much pride			0
' @entity65 's are n't the toughest to capture so i 'd feel quite confident - @entity130 seem to be the most difficult to catch			0
' mr @entity9 has caught two @entity65 in the past - one being a 1300lb off the coast of @entity90 in 2000			1
in 2007 he was declared the world 's greatest fisherman after becoming the first person to catch all 27 species in the three so - called ' royal slams ' set by the @entity137 ( @entity137 )			0
he travelled 150,000 miles to some of the world 's most remote locations to snare nine species of shark , ten species of billfish and eight species of tuna			0
in 2012 , mr @entity9 became the first recreational angler in history to catch five different species over 1000lbs			2
mr @entity9 has vowed not to kill @entity30 , but says he 'll scare her off coming near @entity6 shores			1

@entity9 , 70 , has landed sharks during his decades spent fishing
the extreme fisherman even caught a great white in @entity90
the pensioner , from @entity16 , @entity17 , has also amassed scores of fishing trophies
he now wants to stop the huge great white heading towards @entity6
the 15ft shark is the first great white to cross the @entity168 ridge
experts believe she may be pregnant and could give birth in @entity6 waters
