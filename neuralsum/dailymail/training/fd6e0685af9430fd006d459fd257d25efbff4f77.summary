by @entity0 @entity1 was worth more than $ 300 million when he died in 2001 , but the music legend 's 82 - year - old sister @entity2 now struggles to get by - living in a pre-fabricated home in small - town near @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity2 says she has been cut off from the family			1
while @entity1 left his widow @entity9 and son @entity10 the lavish @entity11 , a 120 - room @entity13 mansion in @entity14 just outside @entity15 , @entity2 is unable to support herself without working - managing a touring @entity17 tribute band			1
however , displaying the quiet stoicism her family is famous for , @entity2 says she ' does n't mind not living in a castle because she would rather be broke than live rich and heartless			1
' a long way from @entity22 : the @entity6 , @entity7 , property that @entity2 calls home			1
she has lived in @entity25 for more than 50 years and says she wants nothing from the family of her famous brother gifted a $ 2,000 - a - month pension by her brother for tax reasons in 1980 to help her get by , @entity2 found herself unceremoniously cut off by her brother 's estate almost a year to the day after he died of complications from lung cancer in november 2001			1
@entity2 , who lives alone , found this sum of money to be adequate for her lifestyle			1
she was not given a reason why the allowance was stopped by @entity9 , 65 , or @entity10 , 35 , but knows she would still be receiving the money if @entity1 was alive			1
she said : ' i do n't care about the money , it 's been over ten years and i have n't made any ripples			2
' @entity2 moved to the @entity25 more than 50 years ago , following her first husband , even before @entity17 themselves launched a @entity49 ' invasion ' of @entity25 in 1964			1
about @entity1 's payments , @entity2 said : ' it was my pension from him - it was his intention to make it last my lifetime			1
he said , " given my financial situation , there is no reason on @entity58 why my sister should ever be in need "			2
' but i was never concerned about the termination of the pension , i have found a way to make a living			2
' i do n't have any blame for anyone and i was brought up as a @entity1 and to be self - reliant			2
' @entity2 relives the glory days of the @entity17 's rise to fame with the @entity70 , the tribute band she manages			1
touring with them regularly , she does make appearances with the band and entertains the crowds after shows with her fond recollections of her brother and , of course , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
getting by with a little help from her friends : @entity2 , pictured left with @entity1 in 1962 , and right in 2002 , says she manages to be self - reliant and has a circle of friends in @entity6 , @entity7 sprawling estate : @entity11 , the 120 - room home in @entity14 where @entity1 lived with his wife @entity9 and son , @entity10 , before he passed away in 2001 beatle : @entity1 a year before his death at the @entity92 @entity91 in 2000 ( left ) , and during a rare public appearance in @entity94 in 1992 however , with the end of the touring schedule , business has been slow and money has become tough			1
she said : ' i am struggling for money , like everyone , but i am not on the breadline			0
i am not " skint " , as they would say in @entity49			0
i feel very fortunate to own outright the land that my two homes sit on - which is better than most			2
' while @entity7 has a checkered reputation as a den of meth - production and drug addiction , @entity2 claims that she has seen none of that in her neighborhood of @entity114 , adding : ' my neck of the woods is carefully managed by the local assembly men and a vigilant police force			1
' even so , @entity114 is a world away from @entity11 in @entity14 , a stunning 120 - room @entity13 mansion that @entity1 left to @entity9 and @entity10			1
conservative estimates value @entity11 at $ 40million			0
@entity2 has fondly spoken of growing up with her little brother in a small terraced @entity70 home			1
when we were @entity17 : @entity126 with @entity17 @entity127 @entity1 ( died november 2001 ) @entity125 ( died december 1980 ) and @entity80 on the set of the @entity129			1
1964 @entity1 was the youngest of four children and was doted on by his elder siblings			0
' @entity1 was a smashing kid , always smiling			0
he was a great brother , ' she said in an interview in 2009			0
' i was very protective of him , he was just my little kid baby brother			0
' @entity2 moved to @entity135 with her @entity137 mining engineer husband , @entity136 , and had two children in the late 1950s			2
meanwhile , back in @entity49 , @entity1 met a young man named @entity80 and together they joined a band named the @entity142			0
in october 1962 , @entity143 was released in the @entity49 and the nation became gripped by the four mop - tops and their sensational style			0
however , at that moment , the band was unknown in @entity25 - a situation that their manager @entity148 hoped to change			2
@entity2 , stepped up to the task and she took it upon herself to visit every small - town @entity151 she could , asking them to play her kid brother 's band 's songs			1
staggering : @entity49 rock group the @entity17 performing their last live public concert on the rooftop of the @entity161 @entity160 building for director @entity163 's film documentary , ' @entity164 , ' on @entity165 , @entity15 , @entity166 incredibly , she got their hit from me to you played on a local @entity135 radio station in june 1963 - the first known example of @entity17 getting airplay in the @entity25			1
she still has letters from @entity148 , expressing gratitude for how she helped them break @entity25			0
' i did all i could to help my kid brother , ' she says			0
in 1963 , @entity1 spent two weeks at @entity2 's home			1
he was able to walk the streets unrecognized , he went camping and played with a local band in front of a small crowd of 150			0
five months later he returned to the @entity25 with @entity17 to appear on the @entity129 - and the history of popular music changed forever			1
@entity2 traveled to @entity186 to see her now world - famous brother and met @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity80 and eventually @entity1 's then girlfriend , @entity189 - for whom he would end up writing the ballad @entity190			1
@entity2 recalls that the moniker of the ' @entity193 ' was bestowed on her brother - for the wrong reasons			1
@entity1 was in fact suffering a strep throat at the time and as a result could n't speak to the press or address the hordes of screaming girls who had flocked to see him			0
the brother and sister spent the 1960s and the 1970s very close , but @entity1 reportedly distanced himself from her in the mid-nineties , however - because he disapproved of the conversion of her old @entity135 home into a ' @entity17 bed - and - breakfast ' inn , called @entity210			1
@entity2 does not own the establishment , but did use her name to help promote it because the town had fallen on hard times			2
she was says that she was trying to help them economically			0
all those years ago : @entity1 with his parents @entity217 and @entity2 at home in @entity70 when @entity1 lay dying in hospital in @entity222 more than 10 years ago they reunited			2
@entity2 was led into a room where she found a familiar , though diminished figure propped up in a reclining chair , clinging to life			2
the only other people present were @entity9 and her sister @entity228 , and @entity10			1
they left @entity2 and @entity1 to hold hands and reconcile for 90 minutes			2
' @entity1 was pretty frail , yet he was also still vibrant , ' she recalled in a 2002 interview			0
' his eyes were still bright			0
he must have been in pain , but he did n't show it			0
we reminisced about our childhood , and his sense of humor was the same as ever			0
' people always teased him about his sticky - out ears ; now his oxygen tubes were hanging over them			0
he laughed and said : ' my ears finally came in useful for something			0
' as their time together drew to a close , @entity1 humbly apologized to his sister			0
' you know , i could have been a lot more help to you ; i 'm sorry , ' he told her			0
they parted with what she calls a ' @entity257 '			0
' remember to pass it on , sis , ' he bade her ; she promised she would .			0
