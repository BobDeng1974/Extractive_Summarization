@entity0 , having done everything humanly possible to prove he is worthy of that mega-fight with @entity3 , may be denied the chance forever by the public demand for the @entity7 man to meet the @entity8 in the richest boxing match of all time			1
it could be may or nothing for @entity0			0
but the prospect of riding his brilliant saturday night victory over @entity16 into the opposite corner for @entity3 ’s next fight is threatened by @entity20 ’s announcement that he is finally ready and willing to meet @entity8 in the spring			1
there is one fight left after that on @entity3 ’s $ 300 million dollar contract with the @entity26 pay - per - view cable network			2
and that will be the last of those half - dozen @entity26 fights after which @entity3 , now 38 , is threatening to retire			0
@entity43 , @entity0 ’s @entity43 promoter , concedes : ‘ it will be perfectly reasonable if @entity3 and @entity8 get it on			2
this is not only the fight the world has been waiting to see but one which boxing needs to happen			0
but @entity3 is instead trying to make a long - awaited fight happen with @entity8 @entity50 ( right ) was the 46th and 47th victim in @entity3 's so far unbeaten career ‘ i still do n’t think it will take place but if it does we will need @entity56 for @entity0			1
’ the alternatives include a @entity58 with @entity60 ’s new – albeit stabbing victim – world welterweight champion @entity59			0
@entity61 , @entity59 ’s promoter , was at ringside in @entity30 on saturday night talking up that fight as a @entity64 follow up to his spectacular staging there of @entity68 ’s stunning ko of @entity69			0
@entity0 would also like to set the record straight in a revenge match with @entity72 , who temporarily derailed his career with a knock out			0
but @entity3 is the dream and after proving so splendidly against @entity16 that he deserves that chance @entity0 will be mortified if it does not become reality			1
the @entity78 celebrates his victory over @entity16 at the @entity80 in @entity30 on early sunday morning @entity0 with @entity81 president @entity43 after victory early on sunday @entity83 calls out @entity8 for 2015 fight			1

@entity0 beat @entity16 on points in @entity30
@entity0 has set his sights on a *showdown* with @entity32
but @entity3 looks set to fight @entity8 next
the next chance for @entity0 would be immediately after @entity38
