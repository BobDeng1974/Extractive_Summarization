it would be the biggest airport in the world			0
jutting out into the @entity4 , it would serve 150million passengers a year – more than twice as many as @entity6 – and operate 24 hours a day			1
this is @entity8 , the astonishing £ 50billion vision to solve @entity11 ’s aviation crisis			0
proposal : the estuary airport would be a transport hub with trains able to speed passengers all over @entity17 and @entity18 after they land yesterday , plans were unveiled for the four - runway airport on a sparse strip of land on the @entity24 , in @entity25			2
designed by architect lord @entity26 – who created the new @entity27 – the airport would be a modern - day feat of @entity18 engineering built on reclaimed marshland			1
it would include the @entity18 ’s busiest railway station , handling 300,000 passengers a day			1
icon : @entity26 designed the new @entity27 , and he is looking to create something similarly distinctive at the @entity8 planes would fly in from the north - east , primarily over water , greatly reducing the number of homes that would be affected by aircraft noise			0
with the government having admitted in august that @entity11 ’s main airports will reach bursting point in 2030 – and a third runway at @entity6 having been ruled out – backers of @entity8 insist it offers a splendid solution			0
but they have yet to convince everyone , especially people living in the area			0
councillor @entity53 , leader of @entity54 in @entity25 , said : ‘ the @entity24 is home to one of the world ’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals , with a fifth of the @entity18 ’s gas supply offloaded by container ships and stored there			1
‘ we have looked at @entity26 ’s plan and he appears to want to place his fantasy @entity24 airport on top of the lng plant and a power station			1
’ @entity26 said : ‘ we need to recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy infrastructure in @entity18 for this century and beyond			2
we can do it here			0
’ the airport ’s backers claim that if the government supports the scheme , sovereign wealth funds and wealthy foreign investors will stump up the cash to make it a reality			0
the mayor of @entity11 , @entity85 , yesterday declared his support for the plans , despite them rivalling his own vision for a ‘ floating ’ airport in the @entity4			2
a spokesman said : ‘ he is delighted that a distinguished figure like @entity26 agrees that the answer to @entity18 ’s aviation needs lie in the [ @entity96 ] estuary			2
’ huge : @entity98 artist impression of the @entity8 , a four - runway @entity99 capable of handling 150 million passengers a year danger : @entity54 say mixing the @entity104 import facility on the @entity24 , pictured , with a new airport would be a recipe for disaster lethal : the liquid gas for the area comes via the container port at the @entity24 , which protesters also say makes the area the wrong choice for an airport			1

rival to @entity85 **'s** ' @entity119 ' plan , it would run 24 hours a day and be more than twice as busy as @entity6
a railway station to be built under the new airport would be the @entity18 **'s** busiest , handling 300,000 arrivals and *departures* a day
*critics* say *nearby* gas storage and container port mean it is the ' *daftest* ever ' airport plan for the area as results of a crash would be *explosive*
@entity54 *accuse* @entity26 of never having visited
