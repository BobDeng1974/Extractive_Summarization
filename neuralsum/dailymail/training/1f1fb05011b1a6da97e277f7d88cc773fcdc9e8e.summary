by @entity0 for the @entity1 homework : children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves , according to new research children are held back in life by bad education rather than a poverty - stricken home , a major state study found yesterday			1
it said that children whose parents did badly at school are much more likely than others to fail at school themselves , and end up working in low - paid jobs or not working at all			1
but coming from a home with a low income has by itself no influence on how well a child does , the analysis said			2
the findings from the @entity25 were produced in an attempt to explain why social mobility – the chances of a child being better off than his or her parents – has fallen in @entity32 over the past four decades			1
they provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low - income homes to rise to take high - quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system			2
however they appear to undermine the claims of poverty - lobby organisations and supporting politicians who claim that poverty and deprivation do the most damage to the chances of children			1
the report on ‘ @entity53 ’ was designed to guide politicians to the most important factors in childhood that lead children from poor families into poverty as adults			1
it said that the educational level of parents had the biggest impact on how well children are educated themselves , on whether they are likely to grow up to live on low incomes , and on whether they will be able to afford to pay their rent , heat their home , eat well or take holidays			2
children whose father had a low level of education were seven - and - a - half - times more likely to have a poor education themselves than children with a well - educated father , the study said			1
a child of a poorly - educated mother was three times more likely to fail at school themselves than a child of a well - educated mother			1
children with poorly educated parents were five times more likely to be poor adults than children of well - educated parents			1
and children of poorly - educated parents were 11 times more likely to be ‘ severely deprived ’ as adults than children of well - educated parents			1
a family is considered to be severely deprived if it can not afford four out of nine basic expenses			0
these are paying the rent or the mortgage ; keeping the house warm ; being able to meet an unexpected bill ; eating meat or protein regularly ; having a week ’s holiday ; and having a television , a washing machine , a car or a phone			0
but the study found that growing up in a poor home had no effect on whether someone was poor as an adult			0
‘ the individual ’s assessment of their childhood financial situation is not a significant predictor of poverty once educational attainment is accounted for , ’ it said			2
‘ this suggests that household income during childhood mainly impacts future life chances through the educational attainment of the child			0
. ’ it added : ‘ there is no evidence of a relationship between severe material deprivation now and the financial situation of the household as a child once education is controlled for			0
’ the findings , the analysis said , are ‘ consistent with previous research indicating that income itself is not the primary driver of poverty persisting through the generations			2
’ however , the @entity25 said that one other factor that did affect a child ’s life chances was whether or not he or she was brought up by a single parent			1
children growing up with a single parent are one and a half times more likely to do badly at school than those with two parents			1
the findinds provide powerful new support for the argument that the failure of children from working class and low - income homes to rise to take high - quality jobs with high earnings is rooted in the education system the findings were gathered from the @entity169 - @entity168 survey carried out by the @entity169 ’s statistics arm in 2011			2
@entity171 questioned 13,500 adults in @entity32 about what their homes were like when they were 14			0
in all , the survey covered more than 200,000 people across @entity176			0
the findings come at a time of deep controversy over social mobility and how to increase it			0
this week the @entity182 responded to evidence that a high proportion of people in professional and well - paid jobs were educated in independent schools with a proposal that in future all public sector organisations should be made to publish information on the class backgrounds of employees			0
charities and pressure groups have been blaming poverty for the lack of social mobility in @entity32			0
@entity199 , for example maintains that @entity201 policies favour the super-rich and ‘ decrease social mobility , increase poverty and create economic instability ’			0
it wants to see higher minimum wages , higher taxation of the better - off , and more spending on public services			0
however the @entity25 report is likely to give ammunition to @entity212 who want to see the re-establishment of the grammar schools that once gave a top - class education to selected children from working - class homes			1
supporters of grammar schools point to the evidence that social mobility began to decline in the 1980s , following the abolition of most grammars			0
in 2011 a large - scale independent study found that children with better - educated parents begin to forge ahead of others after they have left primary school and gone on to secondary school education .			2

@entity25 research finds father **'s** ability holds *key* to a child **'s** *success* as school
it appears to undermine claims poverty does biggest damage to prospects
children of single - parent families are *1.5* times more likely to do badly
