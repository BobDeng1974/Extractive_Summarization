by @entity0 living with heart fears : @entity2 and baby @entity3 from the moment her boyfriend @entity5 proposed , @entity4 dreamed about her big day and starting a family with the man she loved			1
but a year after she said yes , @entity2 was questioning whether she should call it all off			2
it was n't that she no longer loved her fiance - rather that , aged just 30 , she had been diagnosed with an inherited heart condition			1
although she had no symptoms and was fit and well , the condition meant her heart could stop suddenly at any time - and any children she had might also have the life - threatening condition			1
@entity2 discovered she had the heart problem only because her otherwise healthy father had suddenly become ill. many others are living under the same threat , they just do n't realise it			1
about half a million people have a faulty gene which puts them at risk of a heart defect that could lead to a sudden premature death , says the @entity28			1
' it is an estimate , but it may be even more common than that , ' says professor @entity31 , a cardiologist and medical director of the charity			2
' there are dozens of types of these conditions but all are potentially deadly because they put the patient at increased risk of having a chaotic heart rhythm and a cardiac arrest , where the heart stops pumping			1
' the most common is hypertrophic myopathy , which causes the heart to thicken and affects 100,000 @entity45			1
others include long qt syndrome , which affects the heart 's electrical activity			1
each year about 600 healthy people under 35 die suddenly , often as a result of an undiagnosed inherited heart disorder			1
yet these conditions can cause problems at any age			2
the problem is that there are rarely tell - tale symptoms			2
' the biggest clue to whether someone is at risk is to examine their family history and see if any relatives suddenly died under 35 , ' says professor @entity31 , adding that by the time people reach their 50s ' coronary heart disease is the bigger threat '			1
' sometimes you hear of people who have had two or three relatives who drowned - we now know that cold water can trigger a misrhythm of the heart , leading to sudden cardiac arrest with these inherited conditions			1
' while there was no history of sudden death in @entity2 's family , in november 2008 her father @entity79 , 60 , became inexplicably breathless and generally unwell			1
@entity2 persuaded him to go to the doctor			2
at the surgery he became grey and breathless again and tests showed his heart was beating so erratically that he was at risk of cardiac arrest ; he was rushed to hospital and defibrillated to get his heart working properly again			1
without this , he could have died			2
@entity4 of @entity94 with father @entity95 , who has inherited heart condition @entity96 tests revealed that the problem stemmed from an inherited heart condition , arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( @entity96 ) - essentially a fault with the proteins that hold the heart muscle cells together			1
' these act like a molecular glue - if there is a fault with this , the heart can enlarge , ' explains professor @entity111 , a consultant cardiologist based at @entity112			1
scans showed that @entity79 's heart had started to enlarge and , as there was a good chance of him having a cardiac arrest , he needed to have a mini-defibrillator implanted in his body to jolt his heart into beating properly again if this happened			1
the news was a shock			0
@entity2 says her father ' always seemed healthy			1
he was slim and seemed strong physically '			0
@entity79 got help just in time			1
but his diagnosis threw up bigger issues for his children			0
@entity2 and her brother @entity130 , 33 , and sister @entity129 , 38 , were offered screening to see if they had the faulty genes			0
( normally , genetic testing is also offered automatically to the relatives of someone who dies suddenly under 35			1
) this involved a straightforward blood test , but having it was n't a straightforward decision			0
' part of me did n't want to know , ' recalls @entity2 , now 35			1
not least because for her father 's condition , until someone reaches the point of needing an implant , as he had , there is no treatment			1
genetic testing has made a big difference , says professor @entity31			0
' before we had the tests five or so years ago , we could only look at a family history and say " it looks as if you have the faulty genes " when maybe the person did n't			0
' not everyone who tests positive will necessarily be at risk of cardiac arrest or even have heart problems			1
' what we call the event rate ( the number of cardiac arrests or actual problems caused ) is low , so you may have this genetic defect but have a normal lifespan , ' says dr @entity173 , consultant cardiologist to the charity @entity174 ( @entity174 )			0
yet having the test means treatment can be given or lifestyle advice offered to help prevent the condition becoming life - threatening			1
' something like long qt can be simply treated with medication to regulate the heart rhythm , ' says professor @entity111			2
another option is having a defibrillator implant			0
the difficulty for those facing gene tests is that a positive result - even if you have no symptoms - can bar you from certain careers , such as in the @entity193			0
it can also cause a lot of anxiety			0
' some people - especially young men - decide they would rather not know but tend to change their minds when they have families of their own , ' says professor @entity111			0
before they had the tests , @entity2 and her siblings ( their mother died 20 years ago from cervical cancer ) received counselling			0
' if we had the faulty genes , there was no way of knowing when or if the condition would start to cause changes to the heart , ' says @entity2			1
' there 's no treatment even if we tested positive			2
' before they had the tests , @entity2 and her siblings received counselling a defibrillator would be given only if the heart was showing signs of damage			2
' but we were all agreed we had to find out			0
' @entity2 had the blood test early in 2010			0
the results showed she has both the faulty genes involved in her father 's condition			1
her brother and sister had only one , so their hearts would n't be affected			0
' no amount of counselling prepares you for getting a positive result , ' says @entity2			0
' i tried to hide my distress from @entity235 because i did n't want to make him feel guilty - but i was very , very upset			0
' it changed the way i felt about getting married and having a family			0
i did n't want to lumber @entity5 with all this and i was concerned about handing it on to our children			0
' she and @entity5 were due to marry that year , but she told him she would understand if he wanted to call it off			0
' luckily , he told me not to be so silly			0
' @entity2 now has a heart check - up every six months			2
she still goes to the gym but exercises more gently			0
' i 've bought a heart monitor and my doctor has said i must n't let my heart go over 150 beats per minute			2
a hard workout used to be my favourite way to relax and i miss it			0
' the advice to stick to light exercise is because a third of all cardiac arrests in people with inherited conditions occur during or just after intensive physical activity			2
when @entity2 became pregnant last year , she was concerned about the birth ' but they kept a close eye on my heart rate and i was fine '			2
her daughter @entity3 is now four weeks old and @entity2 and @entity5 face having to get her tested for the defective genes			1
there is a 50 per cent chance she will have them			0
' it 's difficult because i do n't want her to spend her life worrying about this , ' says @entity2			0
but she and @entity5 , who run a financial advice business in @entity276 , @entity277 , still think they will have her @entity279 , @entity2 is appearing in television adverts starting this week to highlight the need for more research into heart problems			2
' we need to find the people with faulty genes and treat them early - we may one day develop treatments to halt these conditions , ' says professor @entity111			0

@entity4 , now 35 , was diagnosed with inherited heart condition at 30
father @entity79 has arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
essentially fault with the proteins that hold the heart muscle cells together
her daughter @entity3 is now four weeks old and faces getting tested
