@entity0 today backed sir @entity2 's warning that public concern about @entity5 immigration could push @entity6 out of @entity7			1
sir @entity2 said this week that the chances of @entity6 leaving the @entity5 were now ' just under 50 per cent ' - and warned the prospect of ' @entity11 ' would grow unless @entity12 agrees to accommodate @entity6 concerns about free movement			1
speaking in @entity15 , sir @entity2 said he wanted @entity6 to remain in the @entity5			1
but he said public concern about the scale of immigration , and its impact on public services , could no longer be ignored			0
' i think it is very powerful that a former prime minister , a very respected @entity6 politician , with a long record of negotiating in @entity7 , felt it necessary to make that speech in those terms so clearly			2
' it seems to me that one of the reasons he feels so strongly about this is that when countries in @entity7 have difficulties that need to be addressed , @entity7 needs to have the flexibility to address them			0
' when there are problems with the @entity58 budget or countries ' differing views about what power sources they should use or problems countries have with particular aspects of the @entity5 , we need a network that is flexible enough to cope and manage on these things			0
concerns : mr @entity0 said that the @entity5 needed to have the flexibility to address the issues of its member states			1
he made the comments at a press conference with @entity30 prime minister @entity73 , above welcome : mr @entity73 , pictured today with mr @entity0 ahead of the @entity75 summit , indicated that he would prefer @entity6 to stay in the @entity5 but said that he was not going to offer ' specific directives ' to other countries ' that 's why i think @entity2 's speech was so powerful , so important and so timely and i agree with what he said			1
' mr @entity0 was speaking alongside @entity30 prime minister @entity73 , who welcomed him to the @entity23 @entity82 with a speech in which he hailed the @entity6 as ' a @entity7 country with a global role '			1
mr @entity73 indicated that he would prefer @entity6 to stay in the @entity5			2
he said : ' i 'm not going to offer any specific directives to other countries , or indeed to the @entity5			0
' obviously , it is in all of our interests that @entity7 collectively is strong , effective and successful			0
it is in all of our interests - particularly @entity30 's interests - that @entity6 is strong , effective and successful			2
' i think @entity6 has very much kept its own character , very much kept its freedom of action , while at the same time being a strong and effective member of @entity7			0
i just do n't see that this is an either / or business			0
' i think @entity6 can be a strong , powerful global voice , while at the same time being an effective member of @entity7			2

@entity0 called sir @entity2 's speech ' excellent ' and ' powerful '
said he agreed that issue free movement in the @entity5 must be addressed
added that @entity5 must have flexibility to *tackle* concerns of member states
sir @entity2 said ' sheer scale ' of immigrant *influx* strained @entity6 *resources*
@entity30 prime minister said he would prefer @entity6 to remain part of @entity5
