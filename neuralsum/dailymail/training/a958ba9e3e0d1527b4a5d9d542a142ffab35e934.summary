by @entity0 @entity2 brothers who suffered a rare condition which meant they shared the same placenta and blood supply , were saved when doctors performed laser surgery in the womb			1
@entity9 and @entity10 had a condition known as twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome , which resulted in an unequal flow of blood from their mother @entity15 's placenta			1
the condition - which can be fatal - was diagnosed when their mother went for a 21 - week scan at @entity22			1
the 32 - year - old , from @entity24 in @entity25 , was rushed to @entity27 's @entity26 where she underwent pioneering laser surgery the same day			1
@entity30 's twin boys @entity9 and @entity10 were born in february after doctors performed life - saving laser surgery on the boys while they were still in the womb a critical operation - with just a 33 per cent chance of both the twins surviving - was carried out in december			1
doctors inserted a camera and fibre optic laser down a tiny endoscope into @entity15 's womb			2
the laser then sealed off some of the shared blood vessels to ensure the boys received a more equal supply of blood			1
the operation was a resounding success and the boys were born on february 12 by caesarian section at @entity22			1
@entity9 weighed 3.12lbs and his brother @entity10 weighed in at just 3.1lbs			1
but if the brothers ' start in life was not enough , they have also had to fight blood poisoning and meningitis since their birth			1
this week mrs @entity30 and her husband @entity59 , 41 , celebrated their sons ' four - month ' birthday '			1
language teacher mrs @entity30 , said they feel very lucky their boys survived			1
she said : ' i was very lucky because the condition can develop very rapidly and i was n't due another scan for a week , but my consultant said she would do it early as she was going on holiday			2
' doctors at @entity26 did an ultrasound to confirm the condition			1
and just an an hour later professor @entity74 performed the surgery			2
but because events had moved so quickly , mrs @entity30 only just had time to call her husband to let him know she was being operated on			1
she said : ' one minute i was at @entity22 and the next i was on the train			2
@entity10 ( pictured ) and his brother @entity9 , have also fought blood poisoning and meningitis since they were born on february 12			1
they were diagnosed with the rare condition twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome when their mother had a 21 - week scan at @entity22 doctors at @entity26 in @entity27 performed the life - saving surgery on @entity9 ( pictured ) and his brother @entity10 ( pictured right with their mother @entity91 ) ' my husband was at work so i had to make the decisions myself			1
he got there just as they started the surgery			0
' it was an awful decision to have to make , but there was no time to lose			0
the longer we waited , the higher the chance the babies could die or be brain damaged			0
' the crucial operation was carried out under a local anaesthetic meaning the expectant mother was fully aware of what was happening to her and her babies			1
she said : ' they had a camera attached to the laser with a monitor nearby			0
' i could see what they were doing			0
i could see a little hand moving about and i prayed the babies would n't move and get caught by the laser			0
' it took 45 minutes and then i was sent to recover in a quiet room			0
another scan showed the babies were both well and i was allowed to go home			0
' twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome occurs in twins who share a placenta , when there is an unequal flow of blood between the two babies			1
too much blood in one twin will put a strain on his heart and cause him to produce more urine to get rid of the excess fluid			2
the other twin will not grow as well and may have little or no amniotic fluid around him			0
the condition can be serious if it is left untreated			0
it is rectified using a harmless laser beam , which seals off some of the blood vessels between babies and makes the blood flow more equal			2
despite its success , the couple were left on tenterhooks knowing that the odds were against both boys surviving			0
mrs @entity30 , a @entity148 and @entity149 teacher , then had to face a 20 per cent chance of a miscarriage during the following six weeks			1
she said : ' i had two miscarriages before , so i was convinced i would lose them			0
' i went back to work because i did n't want to sit at home and panic			0
' at 29 weeks her waters broke but she did not go into labour for another two weeks , giving the twins ' vital extra time '			0
she was also given cortisone in that time to help the babies ' lungs develop			0
both had to overcome a potentially fatal infection of the stomach and blood poisoning but survived			1
they then went home on march 9 but had to return to @entity22 after catching bacterial meningitis			2
however , the boys came through once again and now weigh in at 8.3lbs and 6.10lbs respectively - the size that many babies are actually born at			2
mrs @entity30 , who also has a daughter , two - year - old @entity175 , added : ' we owe professor @entity74 so much			1
without him , we would n't have our boys			0
we would have lost them			0
' we are really grateful to @entity22 neonatal unit as well			2
they were all wonderful there			0
' the boys are four months old now			0
people ask me how old they are and are very surprised when i tell them			0
' professor @entity74 added : ' the boys were delivered by emergency caesarean section and were quite poorly after they were born			2
' i am so pleased they are now both healthy and happy and their parents can enjoy watching them grow up			0

at her 21 - week scan @entity30 was told her twin sons had a rare condition known as twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome
life - *threatening* condition causes unequal flow of blood from the placenta
doctors rushed the 32 - year - old to @entity26 in @entity27 where they operated on the expectant mother using laser surgery
mrs @entity30 and husband @entity59 told their sons had 33 *%* chance of survival
both boys survived but their mother faced *nervous* six weeks , during which medics said she was likely to suffer a miscarriage
@entity9 and @entity10 were born on february 12 at @entity22
since their birth they have both fought meningitis and blood poisoning
