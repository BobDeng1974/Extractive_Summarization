by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 02:00 est , 12 september 2013 planning minister @entity1 said areas such as the @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 were in danger of becoming ¿ embalmed ¿ strict planning rules protecting national parks are to be reviewed , after a minister claimed that beauty spots are being turned into ‘ museum pieces ’			1
planning minister @entity1 said areas such as the @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 were in danger of becoming ‘ embalmed ’ because of the special planning laws that have protected them from unsightly developments for decades			1
mr @entity1 told @entity15 yesterday he was asking his officials to ‘ work up proposals ’ for reform following complaints from developers and business that planning rules in national parks are an ‘ obstacle ’ to economic recovery in the countryside			1
he wants to examine ‘ the balance between growth , economic and social development and the protection of the landscape , and whether current legislation properly captures what we are trying to achieve ’			0
rural campaigners last night accused mr @entity1 of ‘ peddling misconceptions ’ about national parks – and warned he would have a fight on his hands if he attempted to tear up their special protections			1
his comments will also alarm the millions who visit the country ’s 15 national parks			2
mr @entity1 has infuriated campaigners – and irritated many @entity48 mps – with a string of outspoken comments on the planning system			0
within weeks of being appointed in september last year , he attacked the @entity52 and others as ‘ latter - day @entity54 ’ for opposing all building on the @entity56			0
in november , he suggested two million acres of greenfield land would have to be sacrificed to satisfy housing demand , almost half of it driven by immigration			0
speaking in the @entity61 yesterday , mr @entity1 said it was right that national parks had ‘ slightly different ’ planning rules in recognition of their status as ‘ some of the most beautiful parts of the country ’			1
but there was a ‘ danger of making rural communities into museum pieces , not so much protected as embalmed ’			2
the comments made by @entity1 will also alarm the millions who visit the country ¿ s 15 national parks ‘ that applies to many communities within national parks – they will retain their life and appeal only if they are allowed to change and develop , and if people can get jobs and set up businesses			1
‘ that is a necessary underpinning to national parks , not just as wildernesses , but as living , breathing sets of communities			2
’ national parks have their own planning authorities which are exempt from the sweeping planning reforms brought in by the @entity96 in a bid to boost growth			1
@entity99 , of the @entity100 , condemned mr @entity1 ’s comments and warned against any change to protections afforded to national parks			1
she said national parks received 90million visitors a year , generating more than £ 10billion in revenue			0
she added : ‘ these figures suggest that instead of national park status being a block to small businesses , they attract more money into the local economy			0
‘ far from national park being museum pieces , they are exemplars of sustainable development			0
‘ many of the misconceptions being peddled in the debate today – and there were quite a few – were not based on the evidence			0
‘ they were an assault on the essence of what makes our national parks special			2
