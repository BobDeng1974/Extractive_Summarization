by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity4 's @entity3 squad found a novel way to prepare for their final group game against the @entity7 , by training with a rugby ball			1
@entity11 stars @entity9 and @entity12 were at the heart of the action , while @entity16 's @entity15 seemed less comfortable with the oval - shaped ball			2
the squad looked relaxed and they threw and kicked the rugby ball around , with coach @entity20 showing off his skills and @entity12 practicing his volleying tecnique			0
give it a try : @entity9 seemed to enjoy the unorthodox training methods in @entity26 eye on the ball : @entity12 demonstrated that he can strike a ball with his left foot , whatever the shape straight through : @entity15 did n't show quite the same ability with the rugby ball as he does with a round ball @entity4 need just a point against the @entity7 on thursday to ensure that they top @entity36 , and even a defeat would leave them likely to progress , barring a huge swing in goal difference			2
international teams preparing by playing other sports is not an entirely new phenomenon - @entity45 cricketer @entity44 famously injured his ankle playing touch rugby before a @entity49 in 2005			0
luckily for @entity20 and his squad however , the team seemed to come through without any mishaps , and will be keen to seal their last - 16 place on thursday			0
@entity54 's out , guns out : @entity12 and @entity57 show off their muscles during a relaxed session skills : coach @entity20 juggles a rugby ball as the @entity64 squad enjoy their session elbows : @entity67 takes an elbow in the face from @entity70 as they compete for the ball on their way : @entity4 need only a point to progress after beating @entity77 and drawing with @entity78 video @entity64 business soaring in @entity80			1
