by @entity0 black students have achieved the biggest progress in their exam results of any ethnic group in @entity6 , it was today revealed			1
new figures show 58.1 per cent of black pupils scored five a * to c grade passes at @entity10 last year , a rise of 8.8 per cent since 2010			1
they achieved the greatest rise in both @entity14 and maths - with 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of students reaching their expected level of progress			0
success : black pupils have achieved the biggest progress in their exam results of any ethnic group in @entity6 meanwhile , just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all @entity6 pupils made their predicted grades , according to the the @entity24 statistics obtained by @entity25			1
it means black students have narrowed the gap between their gcse results and the national average by more than half in four years - from 5.8 per cent in 2009 to 2.5 per cent last year			1
the improvement in test and exam grades was most significant among black boys from poor families and in sponsored academies , the figures published today showed			1
the rise in progress could be due to the 2011 introduction of the @entity41 , which has encouraged schools to enter thousands more pupils for the core academic subjects			0
difference : in gcse @entity14 and maths , 76.2 per cent and 74.3 per cent of black students reached their expected level of progress last year			2
this is compared with just 70.4 per cent and 70.7 per cent of all @entity6 pupils the performance measure ranks schools based on the percentage of students who achieve 5 + a * - c grades in @entity14 , maths , science , a language and a humanities subject			2
it also allows institutions to designate ' pupil premium ' funding to disadvantaged pupils , enabling them to address the underlying inequalities which exist between such students and their peers and it was not just @entity10 results in which black students showed a significant improvement			1
according to the statistics , 73 per cent of 11 - year - olds of black ethnicity reached the expected benchmark in maths , reading and writing exams last year			0
exams : the figures were published today in a league table showing the exam performance of ethnic groups this is just two percentage points behind the national average - a smaller gap than the five percentage points difference in 2010			1
schools minister @entity84 said : ' for years black pupils ' results have lagged behind their peers but that gap is being eroded at all levels - the government ’s school reforms are helping thousands more black pupils , including the poorest , to do well at primary school , thrive in their gcses , and then succeed in life			1
' it is particularly through sponsored academies , where long - term under - performing local - authority - run schools are being turned around by brilliant sponsors , that black pupils are benefiting			2
' there are proportionately far more black pupils in academies than in council schools , and the improving performance of black pupils is reflected in the improvements in academies			0
' a @entity24 spokesman told @entity107 that the latest figures showed how the government ’s education reforms are ' raising standards among black pupils more quickly than any other ethnic group '			2
earlier this month , it was revealed that dozens of exam qualifications in subjects , such as film studies and home economics , are to be axed			0
regulator @entity118 plans to cull 14 gcses and 29 as and a levels , while reforming other qualifications			0
media studies , for example , is to be revamped at @entity10 and as - level and scrapped at a-level under the proposals			0
the gcses planned to be discontinued include expressive arts , electronics , catering , home economics , manufacturing , engineering , performing arts and humanities			0
the aim is to make qualifications in different subjects ‘ similar in their level of demand and assessment structure ’ and to cut out ‘ similar or overlapping ’ courses .			0
