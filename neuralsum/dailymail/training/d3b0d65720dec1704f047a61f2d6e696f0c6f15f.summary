if you were sunbathing on a beach over the summer but could only think of buying your @entity3 turkey , tinsel and tree you are not alone			1
new research has confirmed the common complaint that the festive period starts earlier every year - august 19 to be exact			1
according to a study by the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) internet searches for terms such as ' @entity15 ' , ' elf and ' presents ' now increase markedly during the summer holidays			1
statisticians say this means are now thinking about @entity3 almost three months earlier than in 2007			2
@entity3 is getting earlier every year : shoppers in @entity20 standing close to the shopping centre 's christmas tree , but new research has revealed many now start planning for the festive period in august getting ready : the christmas tree season has started with farms like this one in @entity27 , pictured today , which is getting ready to send them all over @entity29 in time for december 25 data analyst @entity30 looked at the volume of @entity3 - related @entity33 searches in each of the past six years			1
in doing so he managed to work out the probability of each week being defined as ' @entity3 ' or ' not @entity3 using an algorithm he originally created for research into fossil pollen			0
he found that from a relatively late start of november 11 in 2007 , we turned our minds to @entity3 as early as august 19 in 2012			1
@entity3 started on october 12 in 2008 and august 30 in 2009 before a slight delay to october 3 in 2010 and september 11 in 2011			1
however the last two years have seen the start settle at august 19 and august 25			1
mr @entity30 's results are included in a paper entitled @entity3 really come earlier every year ? , which earned him a runner - up prize in this year 's @entity46 organised by the @entity12 and @entity48 magazine			2
describing his findings as ' a little startling ' , mr @entity30 said : ' from a seemingly late beginning of november 11 in 2007 we had begun turning our minds to thoughts of the festive season as early as august 25 in 2013			1
' while this of course seems absurdly early it should be borne in mind that the beginning of the @entity3 period here reflects a marked change in our mindsets to thoughts of @entity3 , and not the beginning of the full - blown holiday season			2
' nevertheless , it would appear that the prevailing notion is correct : @entity3 is indeed coming earlier every year			0
' early start : an employee at @entity68 in @entity69 checking the festive display which was unveiled on august 4 this year be prepared : @entity71 started selling @entity72 in @entity73 this year @entity12 executive director @entity74 said : ' this is a great example of using publicly - available statistics to take a fresh look at an age - old debate			2
' whilst many of us have n't even started our @entity3 shopping yet , this study suggests people are turning their minds to the festive period earlier and earlier			0
' retailing giant @entity68 opened its @entity3 store in early august with a scant 142 shopping days left to buy all the celebration 's essentials			0
the department store proudly claims to be the first in the world to launch its @entity3 shop this year			0
@entity71 decided to get the countdown to festive period under way in august when it started selling @entity3 cards			0
but the decision by one pub to put its tree up in august made customers upset			0
manager @entity102 got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the @entity106 restaurant in @entity107 , @entity108 - despite there still being 140 days to go			0
but mr @entity102 , who erected the tree to coincide with a @entity3 promotion , took down the tree because the plan ' backfired ' .			0

@entity11 find @entity3 enters @entity116 minds over summer
@entity33 searches of ' @entity15 ' , ' presents ' and ' elf ' *ramped* up on august 19
but in 2007 similar searches did not start until november 11 - @entity122
