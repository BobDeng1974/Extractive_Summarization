two @entity1 favourites have been combined to make the ultimate breakfast - but at more than 1,200 calories this battered bacon buttie with the trimmings is a real belt - buster			1
the sandwich features white bread , bacon , egg and mushroom all dipped in chip shop batter and deep fried by a @entity1 restaurateur who wants to take the taste of the @entity1 - with a twist - to @entity15			1
but at more than half the 2,000 recommend daily calorie intake for women , and a substantial chunk of the 2,500 for men - this big breakfast should probably only be eaten once in a while			1
@entity22 , 45 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , has a @entity26 chip shop and came up with the tasty treat to satisfy hungry brits living in the @entity29 who love fish and chips and a traditional fry - up			1
' the first half tasted amazing			2
but it is cooked in oil , so by the second half , the bread got a bit soggy			2
' but it 's great for a hangover , or if you need comfort food			2
' @entity15 @entity62 is pictured tucking into buttie , and when asked the all important question of whether she would have red sauce , brown sauce or no sauce at all she went for brown on the deep - fried treat			0
@entity22 opened the @entity42 in 2001 to cater for homesick brits craving favourites such as fish and chips , battered sausage , mushy peas and shepherd 's pie			0
taste time : @entity15 @entity62 prepares herself for a fried @entity79 breakfast at @entity42 , located in @entity80 , @entity43 , @entity26 anxious : the giant breakfast sandwich is bigger than @entity62 's hand and also is more than half her recommended daily calorie intake first bite : the sandwich has a crunchy outside although its creator admits that the bread can get a bit soggy standard : of course , if you were watching your weight you could just go for the unbattered version ! staff also deep fry slices of pizza , chocolate bars , macaroni cheese or ingredients supplied by customers , such as slices of cake , pieces of fruit , or @entity26 hotdogs			1
one large fried egg : 100 calories three @entity107 : 600 calories two slices fried bread : 300 calories fried mushroom : 50 calories batter : 200 calories @entity22 said : ' we like to experiment and a battered breakfast seemed like a good idea for a treat			1
' @entity120 is still my favourite though			0
' all requests for the fryer are considered , as long as the items do not explode in hot oil , like oranges			0
deep frying a food item doubles its calorie content , and adds a little on top , explained manager @entity131 , from @entity132			0
in time for @entity133 , @entity22 has also tested some new @entity15 ingredients , to find a treat for his @entity15 diners			0
first , he tried deep frying a whole pumpkin , then he battered chilli peppers , stuffed with pumpkin , bacon and cheese , which were a big success			2
but the chosen dish , which will feature as a special on his menu , is a battered @entity15 corn muffin , stuffed with traditional @entity15 sweets called @entity147			0
' they 're hard yellow and orange sweets , which everyone eats at @entity133 , ' said @entity22 ' but the heat from the frier melts them , and it makes a really gooey filling inside the corn muffin			0
' festive : @entity22 , owner of the chip shop , proudly sits with his freshly fried fruit platter - designed for @entity133 spooky : no @entity133 would be complete without deep - fried carved pumpkin ...			1

the calorific breakfast contains white bread , bacon , egg and mushroom *encased* in chip shop batter
this creation is being served in a @entity1 chippy in the heart of @entity26
