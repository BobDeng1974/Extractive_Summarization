by @entity0 for @entity1 is n't the @entity3 language marvellous ? some would n't say so , but for 20 years traditional @entity5 words have slowly been replaced by @entity6			1
and now , words like ' marvellous ' have been usurped by the @entity9 clich√© : ' awesome '			1
not keeping to the book ? britons are gradually abandoning traditional words for americanisms like ' awesome ' the gradual change , charted by researchers at @entity16 and @entity17 , has also seen the decline of ' cheerio ' , ' pussy cat ' , ' marmalade ' and ' fortnight ' , which are now barely used by anglophones			1
while in the 1990s we were captivated by ' @entity24 ' , today it has been replaced by the likes of ' online ' and ' smartphone '			1
other words like ' catalogue ' and ' drawers ' , which were also regulars of the 1990s , have had to make way for 21st century sayings like ' @entity33 ' , ' internet ' , ' @entity35 ' , ' essentially ' and ' treadmill '			1
figures show that in 2014 the word ' awesome ' appears 72 times per million words compared to ' marvellous ' , which has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only two times per million today			1
researchers believe the digital revolution and @entity9 's growing influence on our culture have dramatically changed the way @entity5 people speak			2
decline : words like ' fortnight ' , ' cheerio ' , and ' pussy cat ' are also on their way out of general speech language expert professor @entity55 , from the @entity56 to @entity57 ( @entity58 ) at @entity17 , said : ' these very early findings suggest the things that are most important to @entity5 society are indeed reflected in the amount we talk about them			1
' new technologies like @entity33 have really captured our attention , to the extent that , if we 're not using it , we 're probably talking about it			0
' the rise of ' awesome ' seems to provide evidence of @entity3 's influence on @entity5 speakers			1
' these are only the initial findings from a small pilot of the project , named the ' @entity78 ' , which is now underway			0
prof @entity55 said : ' we need to gather hundreds , if not thousands , of conversations to create a spoken corpus so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years			2
' we are calling for people to send us mp3 files of their everyday , informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help me and my team to delve deeper into spoken language			2
' it is an ambitious project			0
prof @entity55 said : ' it has not been completed to this scale in the @entity5 since the early 1990s			0
' that data , which is now out of date , is still used by researchers from around the world today , so we know there is a real appetite for research of this kind			2
' it is of great importance to collect new recordings from the 2010s in order to understand the nature of @entity5 @entity3 speech as it is today and not how it was more than two decades ago			1
' using the ' @entity78 ' , the team at @entity17 and @entity113 will be able to shed light on the way our spoken language changes over time			1
the research also allows analysis into language used in different regions , between genders and across different age groups			2
the word ' fortnight ' appears to have declined between the 1990s and 2010s			1
instead , the phrase ' two weeks ' is much more popular now than it was in the 1990s , and serves a similar function			0
perhaps ' fortnight ' is nowadays perceived as slightly vaguer than two weeks - perhaps there is a need to be more specific about our arrangements these days , or in accounts of things that have happened in the past			2
the word ' poll ' refers almost exclusively to ' poll tax ' in the 1990s data , which shows how things that are important to us in society , at any time , shape our language use			1
the difference is simply that ' poll tax ' was replaced with another form of tax in the 1990s			2
in the 1990s data , almost half of the time people talked about cats , they called them pussy cats			0
in the 2010s data , people appear to talk about cats no less than previously			0
the difference is that the modifier pussy has been dropped			0
one hypothesis , which i can not verify , is that the word pussy has become too strongly associated with sexual terminology for people to feel comfortable using in other contexts			1
the word ' cheerio ' was used commonly as a parting phrase in the 1990s data			1
this word can not be found in the data we have collected so far from the 2010s			0
we expect elderly people to still use it but not youngsters			0
the use of the word ' essentially ' has risen dramatically between the 1990s and 2010s			0
it appears to have broadened in meaning , being used in contexts where you might otherwise expect the word really			0
this word does not occur in the 1990s data			0
without further analysis it is hard to make any conclusions , but it could be part of a wider trend of increased health awareness in society .			0
