by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 27 april 2013 it is , admittedly , a gesture that could be open to misinterpretation			0
but when charity chiefs asked the three party leaders to pose with thumb and forefinger just a couple of inches apart , they were merely hoping to spread their message that the world was ‘ this close ’ to eradicating polio			1
however , @entity14 and @entity15 turned down the request , for fear of media mischief - makers taking the pictures out of context			1
@entity14 with mp @entity21 holding an @entity23 poster			1
@entity14 refused to pose for the ' this close ' campaign @entity26 , on the other hand , readily agreed – even though his brother @entity27 never lived down the infamous photograph of him holding a banana			1
for all of them , it was a calculated political gamble : weighing up the chances of facing humiliation for striking a pose that wags could misconstrue as a smutty joke about a man ’s endowment , against the clear benefits of publicly backing such a good cause			1
only time will tell which of the leaders made the right call			2
deputy prime minister , @entity15 also refused for fear of the photographs being taken out of context as one @entity57 insider said : ‘ in the age of mass media , what politicians look like can be as important as what they say			1
‘ photos can be used to ridicule them for years to come over any political or personal issues			2
it is not the @entity60 ’s job to provide @entity61 with front - cover photos making him look stupid			2
@entity26 may regret posing in the long run			1
’ but allies of mr @entity26 defended his decision , saying : ‘ cynics may choose to laugh , but getting rid of polio is far more important			1
’ instead of making the gesture , the prime minister and his deputy posed behind posters promoting the campaign			2
however , it seems that they might have been overly cautious – as both have previously been photographed inadvertently making the gesture in entirely unrelated , and innocuous , circumstances			0
the ‘ this close ’ campaign is headed by @entity80 founder @entity79 , who has given more than £ 400 million to the worldwide drive to eradicate polio , led by @entity83			1
scores of politicians , businessmen , religious leaders and celebrities have posed with their thumb and forefinger apart to promote the campaign – ranging from @entity93 pop star @entity92 to @entity95 ’s archbishop @entity94			1
although polio has been conquered in most @entity98 countries , it is still endemic in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
mr @entity79 has spoken movingly of its impact			0
he said : ‘ i was in @entity100 and saw what this horrible disease does to children			0
i was in a slum in @entity109 , and i held a nine - month - old girl named @entity111 in my arms			2
she obviously did n’t understand why people were poking her legs and looking so serious			0
‘ but she ’ll never be able to kick a ball around , never be able to play hide - and - seek with her friends , because she has polio			0
as i held @entity111 , i thought , “ we can end this			2
” ’ @entity26 agreed to pose for the charity campaign			1
allies of @entity26 argue that getting rid of @entity122 is more important than a photograph various celebrities are part of the global initiative to end polio posing with their finger and thumb showing the small step needed to reach the goal of an end to polio @entity83 has set up a website featuring photographs of people performing the thumb - and forefinger - gesture , which it bills as ‘ the world ’s biggest commercial ’			1
the charity says : ‘ after nearly 30 years , and after immunising more than two billion children against polio , we are on the brink of making history			0
we are this close to ending polio for ever			0
you can take action by showing your support			0
snap a photo of yourself making the this close sign and upload it			0
‘ your involvement will help convince world leaders that support for polio eradication is global			0

charity asked the three party leaders to pose for the ' this close ' campaign
only @entity26 obliged , posing with his thumb and forefinger held in the *air*
@entity14 and @entity15 refused for fear that the photos might be taken out of context
