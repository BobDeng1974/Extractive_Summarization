a mom 's decision to take her 11 - year - old daughter to a @entity5 concert has a judge saying , ' so what ? ' the @entity8 judge says the concert trip is n't evidence of bad parenting , despite protestations by the father			1
@entity14 reports the girl 's parents are divorced , and her father accused his ex-wife of ' abusing her parental discretion ' by taking their daughter to the december 2013 concert at the @entity22 in @entity23 , as part of the singer 's national truth about love tour			1
the mother admitted to being a ' little on guard ' about taking her daughter , but that the girl was ' dying to go ' , so the mom looked up clips of the show on @entity34 and deemed them age - appropriate			0
the parents have joint custody , and the father said he disagreed with the ' sexually suggestive ' nature of some of @entity5 's performances and did not want his daughter seeing it			2
a judge ruled that while the singer 's works can be suggestive , they are preteen - appropriate but state superior court judge @entity54 rejected the complaint in a 37 - page decision that contained a brief history of rock ` n ' roll and a commentary on the increasing use of judges as referees for warring divorced parents			1
@entity54 said @entity5 may have some suggestive moves and lyrics , but she 's an artist whose works are n't necessarily inappropriate for preteens			2
@entity54 noted in his decision that he spoke privately with the girl , who is now 12 , and took into consideration the mother 's reasoning for allowing her daughter to attend the show			0
he found that the mother ' in no way , shape or form exceeded the boundaries of reasonable parental judgment ' in taking the girl to the show during her own parenting time			0
he also found that she did n't subject the child to any unreasonable risk of harm , or compromise the girl 's health , safety or welfare			0
