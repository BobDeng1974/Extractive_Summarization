anonymous pranksters have created a spoof map detailing the ' contemporary art ' highlights of @entity4			1
the group - who call themselves mapfodder - poke fun of the pretentious blurb alongside modern art in galleries while leading walkers on a trial of eyesores through the @entity15 town			1
the leaflet , entitled @entity17 ( @entity17 ) have been anonymously distributed around public places with a railway station , car park and bus station among the highlights			1
anonymous pranksters have created a spoof map detailing the ' contemporary art ' highlights of @entity4 fluorescent strip lights on a tower are grandly renamed ' never ! never ! never ! never ! by @entity27 '			1
the accompanying blurb says : ' a tower is decorated with a set of fluorescent tubes which have been programmed to light up in a complex and hypnotic display ' @entity33 , @entity34 , by @entity35 ( or some grilles covering a hole )			0
the pranksters write alongside it : ' casual passers - by are unlikely to realise the true purpose of this simple and harmonious arrangement of grilles : beneath them an endurance piece is in progress , in which the artist is trapped and gagged , facing upwards ' puddle water on a canvas has been grandly retitled ' @entity50 and @entity51 '			2
the ' collective ' claim the piece is reminiscent of later @entity54 ' but with less form and variation - creating a solemn and contemplative atmosphere ' @entity17 satirises @entity59 's policy of playing muzak at @entity61 in ' @entity62 ' by ' @entity63 '			2
it says : ' @entity63 's notorious sound installations imbue existing music with an effect opposite to that intended by its composers			0
' in this instance , compositions designed to be calming and relaxing are piped into the waiting area of a busy bus station where they create a heightened sense of stress and irritation in their captive audience			0
' @entity80 ( which is actually just a photograph of stone slabs in a tower )			0
@entity85 's outspoken works involve the removal and ritual destruction of an item of utilitarian value , and replacing it with something of no perceivable use in the context into which it is placed ' mr @entity95 ' @entity94 ( stencils on a car park pillar )			1
the blurb reads : ' @entity100 's template - based techniques are here further abstracted by " mr @entity95 " , creating clean and simple motifs which are devoid of any meaning other than the object they clearly represent ' ' @entity104 and 39 , @entity105 '			1
' minimalist architect @entity107 specialises in removing the clich√©s of urban dwellings , such as guttering , windows and doors , creating living spaces permeated by an intense , if claustrophobic , energy ' , the jokers write @entity17 satirises @entity59 's policy of playing muzak at @entity61 in ' @entity62 ' by ' @entity63 ' chipped emulsion on a staircase ? or @entity119 , by @entity120 @entity121 's ' @entity122 '			0
the mickey taking modern art ' experts ' say : ' this is typical of @entity121 's installations , where the nameplate is put on an equal or even greater footing than the work itself , therefore effectively becoming part of the work ' the new - ish @entity134 and @entity135 also receive a bashing in ' the emperor 's @entity137 ' by ' @entity139 '			1
it says : ' @entity135 's inventive response to savage cuts in its arts budget was to commission this massive , multilayered and adventurous sculpture which can only be seen by true art connoisseurs			2
' a @entity147 spokesperson said : ' it 's just a bit of fun , a piece of anonymous comedy			1
@entity154 - @entity153 : @entity134 's @entity155			2
the artist ' ignores all conventions such as font size , orientation and consistency , and including random elements ( small panels , insulation tape and indistinct painted forms ) ' @entity165 3 : location 20 ( or a picnic table on a pavement )			2
' an object usually associated with pleasant rural scenery is placed into an area of urban blight ' this piece , entitled come in ! by @entity173 , appears to be nothing more than some pictures of concrete but the accompanying blurb calls the pictures an ' audacious piece which entirely subverts the notion of the word ' brick towers , re-imagined as modern art. @entity147 spokesperson said : ' it 's just a bit of fun , a piece of anonymous comedy ' ' if it makes people laugh then it 's worked ... yes , it is a bit of a mickey takeof poor contemporary art , but mainly of the pretentious blurb in galleries			1
' @entity199 , i genuinely believe that some of this stuff could work as a piece of art. ' town centre and @entity206 councillor @entity204 praised @entity147			1
he said : ' i love it			0
i came up with an idea for " misinterpretation boards " instead of interpretation boards			0
' they might have too much time on their hands but it certainly highlights some of the issues			0
' it 's highlighting some of the areas that do need attention and if it brings them to people 's attention that 's great			0
it 's quite banksy-esque in the way it 's quite subversive and i 'm all for a bit of that			0

anonymous @entity100 - style group @entity147 poke fun at contemporary art
