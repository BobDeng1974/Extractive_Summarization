it was a perfect september day ; the air still with small white clouds scudding across a blue sky , the sun warm on our backs			1
bees buzzed and small white butterflies fluttered around the wild flowers that lined the deep lane			2
with the church spire of a peaceful village in the distance , we could have been on a sunday walk along an ancient drovers ' road			0
but when we stopped , our guide sharply focused our attentions well away from thoughts of a rural idyll			0
he revealed that we were close to the spot on the @entity23 where @entity24 , an official @entity25 war photographer , set up his camera to capture the most dramatic shot of his life - as the @entity30 redoubt of @entity31 was blown sky - high early on july 1 , 1916 , the first day of the @entity33			1
lest we forget : the @entity34 to more than 72,000 @entity25 and @entity36 dead of the @entity33 it would last until november 13 , by which time the @entity25 had suffered 420,000 casualties - 60,000 on the first day alone			1
our guide , a military historian , knew his stuff and told it well			0
he knew when to insert an anecdote or flesh out a character , and had an engaging habit of referring to general @entity45 , commander of the @entity46 in @entity36 , as @entity47			0
the @entity23 was our last stop on an absorbing four - day tour of the @entity50 , that shifting barbed - wire battle line between the @entity53 and @entity30 armies running some 440 miles from the @entity55 coast to the @entity57 border			1
over the top : @entity25 soldiers advance during the @entity33 in july 1916 our group of 21 , mainly middle - aged plus , included a father and his quiet , observant 14 - year - old son who had a knack of finding fragments of weapons and ammunition			1
we visited battlefields , cemeteries , field stations , memorial parks , a magnificent museum and a clutch of quirky cafes , once houses close to the front line , now with an assortment of war memorabilia , often including trenches in the back garden			1
our trip was moving , heart - rending , often shocking , sometimes light - hearted - but never depressing			1
one evening at 8pm we stood , part of a silent crowd , at the great @entity85 of @entity86 as the buglers of the local fire brigade sounded @entity89 as they have done every evening , except during the @entity90 , since november 11 , 1929 , when the tradition was established			1
the words ' they shall not grow old as we that are left grow old ' , often spoken by a visiting dignitary , still touch the heart			1
the @entity97 , more a magnificent arch , was built on the crossroads where @entity25 and @entity101 troops marched east out of the town to the battlefields of the @entity104			1
panels of white @entity108 stone , chiselled with the names of 54,389 men missing in those battles , line the arch ; the @entity112			1
the silence was intense as the last bugle note died away			0
@entity115 ( right ) visited the great @entity85 at @entity86 , where the buglers sound @entity89 every evening battles result in cemeteries and memorials , and there are hundreds of them , from small plots on the edge of a village to the majestic splendour of the @entity34 to the 72,000 - plus @entity25 and @entity127 men missing on the @entity33 and with no known grave			1
there is an atmosphere of tranquillity in every carefully tended cemetery , with seasonal flowers or evergreens growing in the small strip of earth in front of each white stone grave			0
some of our group had requested ' special visits ' to cemeteries where relatives were buried			1
as my father had survived the @entity146 in 1915 , i was curious about the site - as was another in our group , @entity150 , who by an extraordinary coincidence also had a father who had survived the carnage			1
the battle lasted 19 days and was a failure			0
the @entity25 used gas for the first time , some blowing back over their own troops			0
@entity162 's only son fell at @entity163 ; @entity164 survived and wrote vividly about his experiences in his autobiography @entity166			1
poignant : visitors ’ crosses in barbed wire at the preserved battlefield of @entity170 just south - east of @entity86 @entity150 had brought a copy of her father 's war diary and showed me part of his entry for a 6am bombardment at @entity163			1
he wrote : ' ... the sight of men stumbling into reddish mist [ gas ] then they sat down suddenly as though tying up their shoes			2
after a while realized with a shock they were dead			0
' my father , only slightly gassed , got a bullet through his right arm and was discharged			2
earlier that year , he had fought with the @entity189 at the @entity190 , another disaster with high casualties			0
as a child , i thought his picture of a mounted priest standing on a muddy track in front of a group of weary soldiers rather gloomy			0
as he never talked about the war , i understood the picture 's significance only after his death			2
' the last @entity203 of the @entity204 at @entity205 ' took place on may 8 , 1915 , the eve of the battle of @entity209			2
painted by @entity211 , it caused ' a minor emotional storm ' when it appeared in @entity214 in november 1916			0
sadly , bombs in the @entity90 destroyed the original			0
my copy will go to my third grandson , who , aged 13 , knew more about my father 's war than i did at the age of 70			1
fleshing out a character : @entity223 sir @entity45 ( left ) with general @entity224 and , right , @entity225 trenches at the @entity226 at @entity170 , south - east of @entity86 fortunately , the @entity225 is now on the school curriculum and the course includes battlefield trips			1
i saw a school group at the @entity85 and another walking decorously on a conducted tour through trenches at the @entity235 memorial park			1
cheery participants in a 10k sunday run streamed past us as we walked to the excellent interpretative centre in what is now a green 250 - acre park - with areas of unexploded bombs safely fenced off			2
when the @entity244 attacked @entity235 in snow and sleet at 5.30am on easter monday , april 9 , 1917 , they fought on devastated war - scarred land , but took the ridge			2
the guide pointed across the trenches			0
' the @entity30 front line was there , close enough for the troops to shout across to each other			0
' one @entity30 is said to have warned : ' @entity256 , you better be careful			0
we 're moving out , the @entity258 are coming and they 're very good shots			2
' sombre : the group visited the @entity30 cemetery at @entity262 where four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones somehow it was fitting that we visited the sombre and severe @entity30 cemetery at @entity262 early one misty grey morning			2
here , four brooding bronze soldiers guard their fallen comrades buried under black stone slabs without headstones , many to a grave			0
there was no sense of tranquillity here and the folly and waste of war somehow seemed so much more forceful			0
it was forceful , too , at the preserved battlefield of @entity170 just south - east of @entity86			1
the man - made hill was built - up spoil from the adjacent 19th century railway			2
new growth has slightly softened the scars and mine craters but randomly scattered lumps of concrete and a massive ruined pillbox , a good 3ft thick and partially covered by brambles , give the place a brutal air			0
a vital vantage point , the hill changed hands several times during intense fighting			0
@entity86 itself never fell into enemy hands but the bodies of many soldiers from both sides still lie below this battlefield			1
the adjacent privately owned @entity226 and cafe is an oldstyle tourist attraction			0
the remains of trenches , the heaps of shrapnel , barbed wire and rusting weapons in the garden , together with the assortment of military memorabilia in the museum - badges , scraps of letters , yellowing newspaper cuttings , caps , spiked @entity30 helmets , bayonets , posters - all touch the heart			1
preserving history : the @entity226 displays an assortment of military memorabilia on the drive back to the coast , some of us wondered why , when still 80 miles from @entity332 , lunch was to be at seasidesounding @entity333			0
blame the @entity334 , who , unfazed by foreign words , found a simple @entity338 equivalent			0
@entity86 became ' wipers ' ; @entity340 , a much fought - over ridge village , ' @entity341 ' , and @entity343 - a village behind @entity25 lines - ' @entity346 '			1
there was so much more to see and ponder , such as the astonishing smallness of the operating theatre , a windowless bunker , at the @entity352 dressing station at @entity104 where both surgeon and patient could hear the thunder of the front line a few miles away ; the plaque , also at @entity352 , inscribed with the poem in @entity362 , written by dr @entity363 after the death of his friend ; the simple , moving comments in the visitors ' books kept in the bronze boxes at the entrance to all @entity369 cemeteries			1
no wonder people return to the @entity225 battlefields			2
one could never tire of such a deeply layered human subject			0
it 's a long way to @entity376 ... an introduction to @entity378 with @entity379 ( holts.co.uk , 01293 865 000 ) costs from £ 765 and includes four days ' b&b and coach and ferry travel .			2
