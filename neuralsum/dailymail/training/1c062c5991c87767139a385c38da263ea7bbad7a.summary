by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 16 may 2013 the @entity1 in association with this morning and @entity3 recently asked readers to nominate special people in the healthcare sector who ’ve made a real difference to their life , or to a loved one			0
after hundreds of votes , some well - known faces have also talked about their very own health heroes			0
here , sir @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 talk about the doctors who saved their lives			1
explorer sir @entity18 had a heart attack and a consequent double heart bypass in 2003			1
his @entity21 is his cardiac surgeon , professor @entity23 , 60 , from @entity24			1
sir @entity13 says : sir @entity13 ( left ) nominated his cardiac surgeon , professor @entity23 ( right ) as his @entity21 after i had a heart attack on an aeroplane at @entity29 i was taken by ambulance to professor @entity23			1
i was completely out of it and put on a life support machine because my heart was n’t working - professor @entity23 ’s on - going attempts to restart my heart went way beyond what could be expected			1
in 2003 sir @entity13 had a heart attack which resulted in him having to have a double heart bypass while on a life support machine three days later my heart still would n’t tick and he decided to perform a double bypass while i was still on life support			1
it was only on this , the 13th attempt , that my heart started again , thanks to professor @entity23 sticking with it			1
apart from saving my life , he ’s a real hero to me because when i then told him that in three months i needed to run seven marathons in seven days in seven continents , instead of doing what most doctors would do - not risk their reputation by allowing it - all he said was keep to 130 heartbeats per minute and do my best			0
i did and i ’m incredibly grateful to him for being that brave			0
since then i always call professor @entity23 for his opinion about expeditions i ’m planning and he ’s supported me on various challenges that could have impacted my heart , including two attempts on @entity60			1
in 2009 he encouraged me to try @entity60 for a third time again because he knew previously i ’d got within 350ft of the summit			0
that time i did do it and became the first old age pensioner to get there			0
i feel very comfortable calling professor @entity23 whenever i need his help and i know he ’ll make time for me			1
i ’ve heard so many other patients talking about the great things he ’s done for the hospital , completely rejuvenating the cardiac wing by raising money and introducing new equipment and techniques			2
a large number of people in the @entity29 area will directly benefit from his @entity79 show host @entity14 , 55 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008			1
@entity81 ’s @entity21 is dr @entity82 , 45 , consultant general , breast and endocrine surgeon from @entity85			1
@entity81 says : @entity14 's @entity21 is dr @entity82 who treated her when she had breast cancer when @entity82 broke the awful news that i had breast cancer i sobbed for half a second – then i wanted to get on with surgery			1
the nurses had suggested waiting a few weeks to operate but @entity82 understood me straightaway and booked me in for first thing the next day			1
you see , i do n’t ‘ do ill ’ very well and @entity82 realised that and tailored his approach to me completely around my needs			2
i ’ve suffered from depression in the past and following an extensive fitness regime has always helped to keep it under control			0
throughout my chemotherapy and radiotherapy one of my main concerns was the state of my mental health and it was very important to me to continue exercising and working on my talk show			0
for most people with cancer , the approach is ‘ sit down , take it easy ’ - there ’s not many doctors who go ‘ ok , let ’s help you work a 40 - hour week , run , push weights and do kettlebell training three times a week ’			2
while @entity82 raised an eyebrow and said he ’s never had any patients doing that before , he supported me and gave me practical advice to make it easier for me , rather than be discouraging - which , to me , is going over , above and beyond what he had to do			2
he designed my treatment around my television production schedule and booked my radiotherapy appointments early in the morning because of work , i did n’t want anyone to see me and i wanted to be able to run to the appointment			0
i do n’t do pity and @entity82 got that			2
i ’d hear women saying ‘ my doctor ’s so lovely , he held me while i cried ’ – but that would have unscrewed me			0
during her breast cancer treatment @entity81 continued to work a 40 - hour week , run , push weights and do kettlebell training three times a week so @entity82 did n’t talk ill to me , he talked facts , he talked can do			1
his wonderful sense of humour and people skills made such a difference when i felt so low			0
above all this , he ’s a wonderful surgeon and did a fantastic job with my lumpectomy so i did n’t need any reconstruction and left a brilliant scar			2
i recently had my five - year all - clear with @entity82 – even now that i ’m working in the @entity151 , i wo n’t transfer to anyone else because i want to stay with him			2
former @entity153 actress @entity15 , 73 , was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity154 ) in 2002			1
her health hero professor @entity155 , 61 , a consultant in respiratory medicine at @entity157 in @entity158			1
@entity15 says : ‘ the first time i saw professor @entity155 was in 2002 and i thought i was dying			1
i ’d been so breathless on the set of @entity153 so a nurse at @entity162 arranged for me to see him			2
he sent me for tests at the @entity157 and after the results came back he told me only a third of my lungs were working			0
i then realised that since 2000 , when i used to panic and get breathless , it was due to a shortage of lung function so in fact he saved my life			2
i did n’t have the right medication before that			0
@entity15 's health hero is professor @entity175 at @entity157 in @entity158			1
he treats her lung disease i ’d been on a blue reliever inhaler for asthma but that ’s the problem – there are about three million people in @entity182 that have got @entity154 ( the collective name for lung diseases including chronic bronchitis , emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease ) and the blue inhaler is n’t working because they do n’t realise that they ’ve got more than asthma			1
it ’s a shame because had i been diagnosed properly before i think i ’d be better now			2
@entity15 says that when she first saw professor @entity155 in 2002 she thought she was dying but professor @entity155 gave me the right medication , which helped my breathing and allowed me to stay on @entity153 for five years after finding out about my lungs			1
i ’ve got four children and six grandchildren , i ’ve got a place in @entity197 - i ’ve since had a life other than work which i would n’t have had , had i not gone to see him that evening			0
at first i had difficulty using my inhalers but he took me under his wing when i had problems and showed me how to use them			0
he ’s been incredibly supportive and i always know that i can depend on him			0
when you ’ve got what i ’ve got you can have good days and bad			0
you ’re not just cured and if you get cold or run down it can affect your breathing			0
knowing that i can rely on him and that he can help me sort it out is very reassuring and i can ring him at any time , whenever i need him and i get through to him straightaway			0
professor @entity155 is really to the point and he does n’t mess around			1
i take everything he says in - if he says do this or take this , i do it			0
he also explains things in a way that ’s easy to understand			0
his treatment has been amazing and he ’s helped me to live another ten years			0
