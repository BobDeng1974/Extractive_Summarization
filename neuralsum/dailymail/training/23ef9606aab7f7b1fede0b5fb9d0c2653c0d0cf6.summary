by @entity0 a passenger jet came within 300ft of colliding with an unidentified flying object , an official probe has heard			1
despite an investigation , the @entity4 – which examines reports of near misses – could not explain the ‘ blue and yellow ’ object which passed under the @entity9 320			1
the incident happened on december 2 last year over @entity12 , 13 miles east of @entity13 , at around 3500ft			1
near miss : the @entity15 was under 10 seconds away from hitting the unidentified flying object as it approached @entity13 the shocked pilot reported the collision risk as ‘ high ’			1
the @entity15 was descending into @entity13 in clear conditions with the sun behind , when both the plane ’s pilots saw an object around 100 yards away			1
the board ’s report said : ‘ the object passed directly beneath before either of the crew had time to take avoiding action or had “ really registered it ” , although they both agreed that it appeared blue and yellow ( or silver ) in colour and was “ quite large ” with a small frontal area			1
‘ the controller stated he was not talking to anyone else in that area and nothing was seen on radar			1
’ in its report , the board dismissed a variety of possible explanations			0
it said : ‘ in the absence of a primary radar return , it was unlikely that the untraced aircraft was a fixed - wing or rotary - wing aircraft or man - carrying balloon			1
‘ it was considered that a meteorological balloon would be radar - significant and unlikely to be released in the area			1
approach : the plane was 13 miles away from @entity13 ( pictured ) when it came within seconds of colliding with the unidentified object ‘ a glider could not be discounted but it was felt unlikely that one would be operating in that area , due to the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity due to low temperature			1
‘ similarly , the board considered that a hang - glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them			1
‘ members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft			0
the pilot was clearly shocked and reported that there had been a ' high ' risk of collision following the incident on december 2 last year			0
he told his control tower : ' we just had something pass underneath us quite close			0
have you got anything on in our area			0
' they replied : ' negative			0
we ’ve got nothing on radar and we ’re not talking to any traffic either ' the unidentified flying object passed directly beneath the plane before either of the crew had a chance to take action to avoid it			1
both pilots described the object as ' blue and yellow ( or silver ) in colour with a small frontal area but that it was " bigger than a balloon "			1
' near miss : a diagram in the report which shows the pilot 's direction of travel and the unidentified object which is marked as ' @entity109 ' this is a transcript of what the @entity15 pilot told the control tower			1
@entity15 : ' @entity114 [ @entity15 @entity115 ] ' @entity116 : ' [ @entity15 @entity115 ] pass your message ' @entity15 : ' er yeah we just had something pass underneath us quite close and nothing on @entity122 have you got anything on in our area ' control : ' @entity126 negative er we ’ve got nothing on er radar and we ’re n - not talking to any traffic either ' @entity15 : ' er not quite sure what it was but it definitely er quite large and it ’s blue and yellow ' control : ' ok that ’s understood er do you have a an estimate for the height ' @entity15 : ' maybe er yeah we were probably about erm four hundred to five hundred feet above it so it ’s probably about three and a half thousand feet			1
' … we seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it went directly beneath us … wherever we were when we called it in it was within about ten seconds ' … could n’t tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us ” ' control : ' do you suspect it might have been a glider or something like that ' @entity15 : ' well maybe a microlight … it just looked too big for a balloon			2
” the airline involved has not been identified by the report authors			0
several companies fly in @entity9 320 planes from the airport and they can seat up to 220 people - although the number of seats varies			0
the report authors said they had not been able to work out what the object was			2
they wrote : ' the controller stated that he was not talking to anyone else in that area and that nothing was seen on radar			2
search action was taken with no result and the @entity15 pilot stated his intention to file an @entity164			0
' additionally , a further detailed review of individual radar sources did not yield any conclusive radar data that matched the @entity15 pilot 's description of the encounter			2
' the @entity172 's own radar replay also showed no surveillance traces in the immediate vicinity of the @entity15 at the time			1
' once on the ground the @entity15 pilot gave a further description of the event to the @entity178			0
the pilot said : ' we seemed to only miss it by a couple of hundred feet it went directly beneath us - wherever we were when we called it in it was within about ten seconds ; could n't tell what direction it was going but it went right underneath us			2
' asked if he thought it was a glider , the pilot replied : ' well maybe a microlight - it just looked too big for a balloon			0
' but the board ruled out any such aircraft and were baffled			0
' the board initially considered likely candidates for the untraced aircraft			0
the @entity15 crew had not been able to assimilate any information regarding the form of the untraced aircraft in the fleeting glimpse they had , reporting only a likely colour , ' it said			2
' members were of the opinion that , in the absence of a primary radar return , it was unlikely that the untraced aircraft was a fixed - wing or rotary - wing aircraft or man - carrying balloon			2
' it was considered that a meteorological balloon would be radar significant and unlikely to be released in the area of the @entity164			2
' a glider could not be discounted but it was felt unlikely that one would be operating in that area , both due to the constrained airspace and the lack of thermal activity due to the low temperature			0
' similarly , the board considered that a hang - glider or para-motor would be radar significant and that conditions precluded them , as they did para-gliders or parascenders			0
' members were unable to reach a conclusion as to a likely candidate for the conflicting aircraft and it was therefore felt that the @entity4 had insufficient information to determine a cause or risk			0

plane *narrowly* avoided the ' blue and yellow ' object at *3,500ft*
@entity235 happened 13 miles outside @entity13
nothing else was noticed on the radar at the time
object passed beneath the plane before crew could avoid it
