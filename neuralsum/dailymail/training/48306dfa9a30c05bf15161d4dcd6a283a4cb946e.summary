electrical problems found at the @entity2 's $ 1.7 billion data center could delay the new facility 's long - awaited opening this fall in @entity5 , the @entity6 said yesterday			1
the data center is filled with super-powered computers designed to store massive amounts of information gathered secretly from phone calls and emails			1
the @entity6 said it discovered the problem during tests ahead of the fall opening of the facility located south of @entity17 , on a @entity19 base			1
construction : here is an aerial view of the @entity2 's @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity5 electrical failures are complicating the opening of the @entity2 's largest data storage center @entity29 , which is in charge of construction , says experts are working to correct it			1
an @entity2 spokeswoman acknowledges the problem and says the failures are being mitigated			0
the problems were first reported by the @entity36			1
the @entity2 is currently building a facility that will make it more than seven times the size of the @entity40 , making the secretive compounds the biggest in the country			2
in addition to building a $ 1.7 billion data center in @entity5 , crews also started construction on a computing center that is expected to cost $ 792million near @entity48			1
together , the two facilities total 228 acres , much of which is dedicated to the collection of emails and phone calls that it was recently revealed the @entity2 stores without an individual knowledge			0
information overload : a report in july showed the @entity2 is doing a lot more than spying on @entity59 with terrorist connections , perhaps with the help of its $ 1.7 billion @entity23 more convenient : as opposed to the remote @entity17 facility , there is also a 28 - acre facility owned by the @entity2 that in outside of @entity48 , @entity66 much attention has been paid to the secretive practices of the @entity2 since consultant @entity69 leaked classified documents proving that the intelligence agency had free reign to the electronic footprint of people , both in and out of the country , who used certain phone carriers			2
@entity2 official @entity78 told @entity79 that the @entity5 facility is ' only brick and mortar ' but they need the space because ' it 's required to be big ' as a result of their growing surveillance			1
' i think we 're crossing into content , ' he told the site			0
@entity91 , a former cover field operations officer for the @entity92 , told @entity93 that the paranoia surrounding the billion dollar project was understandable yet exaggerated , adding that the main problem was the size of the data collection warehouse			2
more : the @entity23 , near @entity24 , was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the @entity2 was stored storage : an aerial photograph shows the center ' the fact that they ’re building a new data center is n’t news , ' @entity91 told @entity93			2
' they ’ve got several other [ similar ] facilities			0
the size of this is what is creating the stir			0
' once built , the million square foot centre will be more than five times the size of the @entity59 @entity117 , and will use an estimated $ 40m of electricity every year , according to one estimate			0
@entity2 public information officer @entity120 added : ' many allegations have been made about the planned activities of the @entity23 ' what it will be is a state - of - the - art facility designed to support the @entity127 ’s efforts to further strengthen and protect the nation			2
@entity2 is the executive agent for the @entity130 , and will be the lead agency at the center			0
' mystery : a close - up section of @entity2 's @entity23 is shown in @entity24 in july powerhouse : these images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of @entity141 customers , as well as data from companies including @entity144 and @entity145 the @entity23 which is being constructed on @entity146 on the @entity17 - @entity148 line was scheduled to be completed in october - but officials have been tight - lipped about what will be stored there			1
the spy center is being built at an estimated cost of $ 1.7 billion , and is expected to employ 100 to 200 permanent employees after its completion			0
the plans note they must all be @entity59 citizens			0
in light of the nature of the site they are building , many will have to have a higher degree of security clearance than an average construction worker			0
despite the boom for the local economy , the @entity167 of @entity5 has expressed their fears over what will be stored at the center			1
stash : the government has been tight - lipped about what will be stored in the center 's four ' data halls ' plans : sketches released by @entity6 engineers show the massive center , which is believed to cost $ 1.7 billion ' we 're mining data , we 're gathering data and it 's all done secretly , ' @entity167 of @entity5 director @entity182 told @entity187			1
' we do n't even know what 's going on			0
' ' when the @entity2 facility in @entity5 was announced , local officials praised it for the jobs it would bring , ' @entity190 director @entity189 added			1
' as @entity59 are now learning , those jobs entail harvesting the data generated by innocent @entity59 not suspected of any crime , in contradiction to the @entity198			0

government was scheduled to complete its data storing facility in @entity5 in october
