when model of the moment @entity2 made her video debut for beauty brand @entity5 , one thing that stood out most - other than the 19 - year - old 's confident catwalk strut - were her impressively lengthy lashes , which she took every opportunity to flutter at the camera			1
and rightly so , for @entity2 is the face - or rather the eyes - of the beauty brand 's newest ' must - have ' eyelash launch , the @entity16 , a product which claims to give the wearer the same natural - looking length and volume as modeled by @entity2			1
my lashes are naturally very thin , straight and generally lacking when it comes to volume and length			2
in other words , i need all the help i can get when it comes to mascara			0
even if that means taking the time to apply an additional coat of product in the @entity64 it can help me to achieve @entity2 's impressive results , i 'm on board			1
so , i put @entity5 's claims to the test - trying out the primer in all of the three ways that the brand suggests it should be used			1
after first applying the @entity16 by itself , i did n't notice any major differences to my lashes			1
while @entity5 describes the product as being ' tinted black ' - the majority of other alternative eyelash primers are white - it looks like more of a dark grey to me			1
it certainly does n't offer the same bold , black results that i 'm used to from my mascara			2
natural talent : the @entity16 promises natural - looking results and @entity5 claims it can be worn on its own , without the need for any mascara where 's the flutter ? after just applying a coat of the primer , it was difficult to see a real difference to my lash length , volume or color upon the closest of inspections , i do see an increase in definition , and a hint of added volume - but certainly nothing as impressive and fluttery as seen on @entity2			1
if you are lucky enough to be blessed with lengthier lashes than mine however - and you 're in the market for an effortlessly natural eyelash look - this could well be just the product for you			1
personally however , i 'm looking for something a lot more obvious , results that make me think ' wow ' when i look in the mirror , and create a really noticeable difference to my lashes			2
so i 'm relieved to see that after applying a coat of mascara on top of the primer , the results are , thankfully , much more impressive			0
while i would normally need a good two or three coats of mascara before really achieving the kind of volume and length that i desire in my lashes , after using the primer , it takes just one thin layer			0
after re-applying the primer on top of my mascara , the same results remain - however after applying an overly - generous second layer of primer , i did notice my mascara started to flake slightly			0

@entity170 @entity171 visit site current / @entity173 visit site @entity176 @entity175 with @entity177 visit site @entity179 visit site fashion star : @entity2 announced her partnership with the beauty brand in november last year luckily it was n't anything a quick dab of a tissue could n't clear up , but definitely something to bear in mind if you are eager to keep your look as natural as possible			2
but on the whole , i am impressed with the results			0
my lashes look noticeably longer , thicker and have a really strong black tint to them			2
so much so that a colleague even commented on them , asking what product i had used to make them look so lengthy			0
sadly however , they do n't have quite the same natural look to them as @entity2 's do in the @entity16 ad			1
it is hard to tell whether she is wearing the primer by itself or with mascara layered on top but it appears that the seemingly effortless flutter she flaunts at the camera can only be achieved by possessing the same @entity220 / @entity219 gene - or a very talented make - up artist .			0
