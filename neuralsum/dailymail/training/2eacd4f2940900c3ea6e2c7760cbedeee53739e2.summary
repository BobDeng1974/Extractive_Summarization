the controversial quarterback likely stirred ire when he showed up to the party , since he ’s the star player for @entity10 – one of @entity6 ’s biggest rivals			2
what ’s more , @entity2 did his partying while wearing a @entity15 @entity14 after being told by his critics over the course of his high - profile summer break that he should be more like @entity21 minded @entity20 star turned @entity23 player			1
fraternizing : hard - partying @entity3 winner @entity24 kept the booze train going this weekend with a stop in @entity27 for some @entity6 frat partying according to @entity31 , a @entity30 video shows @entity2 ’s make a hasty exit from a @entity6 frat party in @entity27			1
someone yells ‘ get the f * * k out ! ’ and a beer can is clearly lobbed at the unwitting football star			0
he looks to be in high spirits as he leaves , nonetheless			0
and there ’s no surprise there			0
he ’s had a fun - filled summer thus far , one in which he was kicked out of a summer football camp , as well			0
rivals : a @entity30 video claims to show @entity2 leaving a @entity6 frat party on friday amid jeers from the partygoers , whose school is an arch rival of the @entity3 's winner 's @entity10			1
a beer can can just barely be seen hurling toward @entity2 , at left @entity53 retreat ? @entity2 left in a seemingly happy mood and did n't hesitate to attend yet another @entity6 party the following day the rising football star was sent home from the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , on earlier this month by ‘ @entity61 himself ’ after allegedly spending a night out on the town and showing up late to some scheduled events the next day			1
the news of his ‘ late - night partying ’ was first reported by rumors and @entity67 over the weekend , while @entity68 released photos of @entity2 , 20 , out drinking with @entity70 and @entity71			2

so , when the booze - loving athlete showed up to a second day of partying in @entity27 on saturday wearing goodly @entity15 ’s old @entity20 jersey , it ’s no wonder reports portrayed it as a brazen jab at his critics			1
‘ the only way @entity2 could give a bigger " @entity97 " to the national media 's recent coverage of him would be by rocking a @entity20 jersey , ’ wrote a sarcastic @entity101			0
