by @entity0 published : 08:52 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 05:12 est , 7 february 2013 embarrassing : @entity2 's education minister @entity1 has been stripped of her philosophy doctorate after her university found her guilty of plagiarism the @entity2 minister for education is under pressure to resign after being stripped of her philosophy doctorate for alleged plagiarism			1
@entity1 , a close ally of chancellor @entity9 , has been rocked by the decision of the @entity11 after they said parts of her 1980 doctoral thesis had been copied			1
incredibly , she is the second minister to be accused of plagiarism in the @entity2 government after defence minister @entity16 was also found to have copied work for his thesis and quit in 2011			1
the @entity11 launched an investigation after an accusation against mrs @entity1 was posted online by an anonymous blogger			1
a faculty committee concluded that her work , which dealt with the formation of conscience , included a ' substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts '			1
in a statement declaring the doctorate invalid and withdrawing it from ms @entity1 , the faculty head @entity29 said they had ' decided by secret ballot , by 12 votes to two , with one abstention '			2
mrs @entity1 has said she will take legal action against the decision , but it is an untimely distraction for @entity9 ahead of september 's national election			1
' i will not accept the decision of the @entity11 and i will file a lawsuit against it , ' mrs @entity1 , 57 , told reporters during a visit to @entity47 , @entity48			1
she declined to make any further comment for legal reasons			0
pressure : the scandal surrounding mrs @entity1 ( left ) is an unwelcome distraction for chancellor @entity9 ( right ) ahead of @entity2 national elections in september the accusations of plagiarism are especially embarrassing for mrs @entity1 because she oversees @entity2 's universities and had previously been scathing in her criticism of mr @entity16 , who resigned a month after losing his doctorate			2
' an education minister who is proven to have grossly violated academic rules can not continue in the post , ' said @entity63 , a leading member of the opposition greens			0
' i assume that @entity66 will spare herself and education a prolongation of this affair by resigning			0
' mrs @entity9 has not publicly commented on the @entity1 case			0
but members of her centre - right coalition said the minister had fallen victim to a politically motivated campaign to damage the government ahead of the autumn federal election			0
recurring problem : mrs @entity1 is the second government minister to be found guilty of plagiarism after former defence minister @entity16 who resigned in 2011 plagiarised : the @entity11 said @entity1 's work had a ' substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts ' the @entity2 media has been mostly critical of mrs @entity1			1
' if the education minister has cheated in her doctoral thesis , it is like the finance minister secretly hiding away his money in @entity90 or the traffic minister driving a car while drunk , ' said the @entity94 newspaper			0
' there is no alternative ( to resignation ) for her			0
' in tuesday 's ruling , the @entity11 commission said @entity1 had ' systematically and intentionally presented intellectual performance that in reality she did not generate herself '			2
the decision left @entity1 without an academic title , an important symbol of status in @entity2 politics and business , as her degree programme in philosophy finished solely with a phd			2
since the allegations first arose in may last year , @entity1 has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said she wrote her dissertation with a clear conscience			0
her lawyers have said the proceedings of the commission had been riddled with mistakes and were unlawful , not least because information was leaked to the public in the process .			0

@entity1 , 57 , under pressure to resign after decision
@entity11 says her work contained ' a substantial number of unaccredited direct quotes from other texts '
