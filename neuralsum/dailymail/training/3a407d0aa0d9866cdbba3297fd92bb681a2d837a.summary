by @entity0 @entity1 im @entity2 ! the country ’s most famous war comic has crossed to the other side			0
unthinkable as it may be to generations of readers , @entity9 – better known as @entity9 comics – has been in the hands of the enemy for a month			1
a legion of fans , including @entity16 troops in @entity17 , will be shell - shocked to learn that the comic is being printed in @entity19			1
shock : commando comics , which tell tales of @entity16 derring - do in the @entity24 , are now being printed in @entity19 popular : the patriotic content of the comics has not stopped them moving outside @entity16 to be printed hugely popular : the publication has been printed in the @entity16 for the last 52 years but the good news is that ownership of the last war comic of its kind in @entity16 is still firmly in @entity34 hands – at the @entity36 headquarters of @entity37			1
hugely popular since it first appeared in 1961 , the publication has been printed in the @entity16 for the past 52 years			1
but the publisher , which is also renowned for the @entity40 and the @entity41 , has taken a ‘ commercial ’ decision to place responsibility for printing in the hands of the old enemy			2
a spokesman for the firm said : ‘ commando is still a @entity37 publication			0
‘ since the beginning of may , @entity51 has been printed by @entity53 at the plant of their sub-contractor @entity55 , in @entity19			1
’ @entity37 promised that @entity9 readers will continue to receive ‘ the same top - quality product with rich illustrations and exciting storylines ’			0
@entity55 is based in @entity62 , @entity63 – near where the revolutionary @entity65 fighter jets were being built in an underground weapons factory in the @entity24			2
but the switch to a new printing plant in ‘ enemy territory ’ is unlikely to diminish the appeal of an iconic publication which has entranced generations of schoolboys – and more than a few of their fathers			1
more than 4,600 editions of @entity51 have been published and at the peak of its popularity , in the 1970s , it had a circulation of 750,000			0
today it is available in a digital format but ‘ hard copies ’ of the four comics published every fortnight are still read by nearly 10,000 military buffs			0
in the early years , all of @entity9 stories were devoted to the @entity24 , presenting gripping if simplistic tales of grizzled @entity16 ‘ @entity92 ’ facing down dastardly @entity19 or cruel , crazed @entity93			1
legendary illustrators such as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 used a variety of artistic styles and a rich colour palette in the 64 - page ‘ novels ’ to portray @entity16 and @entity103 soldiers at war			2
headquarters : the office building of leading comic books publisher @entity37 in @entity36 plant : but @entity37 , which received a royal visit this month , is not printing @entity51 in - house in more recent times , the comic has extended its range to include a variety of conflicts such as @entity116 , the @entity117 , the @entity118 and the @entity120 conflict			1
but the most popular war comic of its kind has always stuck to the same characteristic motifs of courage , patriotism , noble actions – and making a refreshing cup of tea while in the face of danger			0
the comics are hugely popular in countries such as @entity134 and @entity135 , and have been published in several languages , including @entity137			0
they are also popular with the soldiers of today			0
@entity16 troops in @entity141 recently asked @entity37 to send them a consignment .			2

commando comics have been printed in the @entity16 for 52 years
but last month they switched to a new printing plant in @entity19
*magazines* are packed with tales of @entity16 *victory* in the @entity24
