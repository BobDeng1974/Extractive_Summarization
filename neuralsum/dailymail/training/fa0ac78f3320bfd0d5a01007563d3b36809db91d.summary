social workers knew for six years that a teenage mother , murdered for bringing shame on the families of two @entity5 men who had used her for sex , was at clear risk from predatory @entity10 gangs			1
@entity11 , 17 , from @entity12 had been groomed by a string of @entity14 before she was stabbed and thrown into a canal to die for informing her abusers ' families of the sexual relationships			1
her killer @entity19 , who was 18 at the time , was given a life sentence and will serve a minimum of 17 - and - a - half years after he pleaded guilty to murdering @entity11 in october 2010			1
but it has now emerged that @entity24 's social services were well aware she was at risk and had received information about certain adults suspected of targeting her from the age of 11			1
victim : @entity11 was stabbed and thrown into a canal for bringing ' shame ' on the families of two @entity5 men who had groomed her for sex last week the council 's @entity35 published a serious case review but key passages which reveal they knew she was at particular risk from ' @entity10 men ' had been blocked out with black lines			1
the council went to court in an attempt to tried to suppress the hidden information after a uncensored copy of the report was leaked to the @entity50 newspaper but they have now abandoned legal action			2
the uncensored report confirms that @entity11 , identified as @entity53 , had dealings with 15 agencies and identified ' numerous missed opportunities ' to protect her			1
it states that she eventually became ' almost invisible ' to care professionals			0
details hidden included the knowledge that at the age of 13 @entity11 and a friend had been given alcohol by men at a takeaway who then asked what she would give them in return			1
she had also been referred to a child sexual exploitation project just three months after her 11th birthday			2
another censored passage reveals that @entity11 had been ' mentioned ' during a 2009 police inquiry that eventually led to the conviction of five @entity5 men for sex offences against three underage girls			1
while the published report mentioned the fact that a friend , who @entity11 knew when she was 10 , was ' thought to have become involved in sexual exploitation ' , it concealed the succeeding passage which read : ' with particular reference to @entity10 men '			1
@entity11 was murdered in october 2010			2
she was repeatedly knifed by 18 - year - old @entity19 before pushed her into a @entity85 , where he used the point of the knife to force her head below the surface as she fought to stay alive			0
@entity19 was furious after the young mother revealed details of their sexual relationship to his @entity95 family and was on ‘ a mission to kill ’			2
he exchanged a series of texts with married friend and mentor @entity99 , 22 , who had also had an affair with @entity11 , and who the judge described as a man who regarded white girls as ‘ sexual targets , not human beings ’			1
in one message , sent a day before he killed miss @entity11 , @entity19 wrote : ‘ i ’m gon na send that kuffar ( @entity111 ) bitch straight to @entity112			2
’ in another he wrote : ‘ i need to do a mission			0
’ he talked of buying a pistol and ‘ making some beans on toast ’ , a reference to spilling blood used in @entity119 , a satirical film about suicide bombers			0
@entity19 is serving life in prison after he pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life			0
mr @entity99 was acquitted of murder by joint enterprise after a retrial			0
sentencing @entity19 , @entity129 told him : ‘ i take the view you came under the influence of mr @entity99 who is something of a mentor to you			0
' he seems to have regarded girls , white girls , simply as sexual targets			2
he does not treat them as human beings at all			0
you got into that mindset yourself			0
‘ you no doubt once had feelings for @entity11 but treated her with contempt in the latter stages			2
’ murder : @entity11 was stabbed repeatedly by 18 - year - old @entity19 before being thrown into this @entity85 canal to die killer : 18 - year - old @entity19 was furious after @entity11 revealed details of their sexual relationship to his @entity95 family			1
he was sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 17 years in 2007 , when @entity11 was 13 , she and her family appeared on the @entity152			1
during the programme – about out - of - control children – her sister warned her that ‘ your attitude is going to get you in big danger ’			0
workers at a child sexual exploitation project later sent a report to social services , but no action was taken to remove her from what became a continuing spiral of sexual abuse			2
by the time she was 16 , she had embarked on an affair with mr @entity99 , who was then 20 and already married			0
she gave birth to a daughter in june last year , but mr @entity99 refused to accept that the child was his			0
four months later , and just days before she was murdered on october 12 , she ‘ shamed ’ @entity19 and mr @entity99 by informing their families of her relationship with both men			1
she told @entity19 ’s mother she loved her son and ‘ wanted to have babies ’ by him			0
but mrs @entity180 was furious and attempted to hit miss @entity11 with a shoe , branding her ‘ a dirty white bitch ’ who should ‘ keep your legs closed ’ , the trial was told			2
@entity186 , chair of the @entity187 , said : ' we refute in the strongest possible terms any suggestion that information was redacted from the published report for any reason other than to protect the interests of @entity11 ’s daughter , immediate family and other third parties			1
' in a statement following the publication of the review mr @entity186 denied that more could have been done to save @entity11			1
he said : ' this is a wide ranging study which shows a very complex situation surrounding @entity53 and her child which made it difficult for agencies to engage with her			0
' there is no suggestion that anyone could have saved @entity53 from what ultimately happened to her but clearly her care could have been improved			0
a spokesman for @entity212 said the passages had been redacted ' to protect the interests of @entity11 's daughter , immediate family and other third parties ' there were chances for those agencies to be more proactive in how they dealt with the case and all agencies involved accept that and apologise that the standards of service were not as high as they should have been			1
' it is vital that agencies learn from what happened here and there is clearly a commitment in @entity12 to make that happen			2
as the report comments , there are already many initiatives in place to ensure that services are now improved			0
' last month following the trial of nine men , mainly of @entity5 origin , who were found guilty of raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with drink and drugs @entity248 cabinet minister @entity247 hit out at the ' small minority ' of @entity5 men who see white girls as ' fair game ' for sexual abuse			1
she told @entity257 ’s @entity256 newspaper : ' there is a small minority of @entity5 men who believe that white girls are fair game			1
' and we have to be prepared to say that			0
you can only start solving a problem if you acknowledge it first			0
' this small minority who see women as second class citizens , and white women probably as third class citizens , are to be spoken out against			0
