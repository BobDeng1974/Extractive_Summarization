and jurors were also told that occupants of the @entity14 were allegedly heard shouting ' @entity66 , @entity67 , we 're coming for you , ' followed by : ‘ @entity67 we are going to come back and shoot you , ' shortly before the incident			1
prosecutor @entity72 had earlier warned the nine women and three men of the jury to ‘ prepare to be shocked ’ by the ‘ shocking ’ footage			1
as it the moment of impact was replayed on flatscreens around the courtroom , some in the public gallery gasped in horror , while others became embroiled in an angry exchange which led to the case being temporarily halted			1
eight men today went on trial at @entity30 , each charged with three counts of murder			2
the jury watched as @entity4 showed a black @entity93 slow down as it passed a group of men standing on the pavement - drawing them off the pavement into the road			2
yards behind , the @entity14 and a @entity99 were seen pulling up alongside each other			2
as the @entity93 slowed , the driver of the @entity14 gestured with his arm outside the window to the @entity99 now alongside in @entity105 , @entity106			2
the two cars drove forward , with the @entity14 veering straight in to the group of men			2
its bonnet sprung up on impact as the victims were flung over the top of the car , which was found burnt out around 90 minutes later			1
after the clip had finished , mr @entity116 told the jury the @entity14 driver ’s gesture was ‘ a signal , particularly to the @entity99 , to go ( forward )			2

‘ it was deliberate and co-ordinated			1
it was the modern day equivalent of a chariot charge			1

mr @entity116 told the jury the killings unfolded amid high tension in an area of @entity62 where ‘ a high level of the population are of @entity157 origin , and almost everyone who has a faith is of the @entity161 faith			0
’ he said the incident took place during the faith ’s @entity165 period of fasting , in a three - day period where there was a ‘ breakdown of order across the country ’ , including @entity62			1
one of the important factors in that breakdown was widespread looting of businesses , with a string of businesses targeted in the @entity106 area			0
mr @entity116 said that hours before the car ploughed in to the men , tensions were increasing in the area , tensions which had been ‘ ratcheted up ’ by ‘ gangs of youths driving around in vehicles who were looking for places to raid and , on the other hand , crowds or gangs from the community – essentially @entity157 males out on the street , many armed with sticks , bats and bricks			1
’ he added : ‘ all of the men in the dock must have been aware of that backdrop			0
that backdrop was the reality in this area of @entity62			0
’ mr @entity116 said one car seen with three balaclava - clad men in the back at the @entity208 petrol station close to where the three victims were killed was likely carrying out ‘ a form of reconnaissance … looking for somewhere to target later			1
’ the court was told that the night before the murders , @entity214 – the father of victim @entity11 – witnessed a convoy of three cars carrying mainly black passengers who were wearing scarves or balaclavas			1
mr @entity11 told police the cars parked in a street behind the @entity208 garage			1
up to 15 men got out and walked towards the petrol station , moments before it came under attack from a mob of looters who armed themselves with plastic milk crates stacked on the forecourt			0
@entity214 pictured the morning after his son @entity11 was killed after being struck by a car footage of the attack was yesterday played to the jury and showed masked men smashing through the petrol station windows with the crates before one leapt inside to steal money from the till			1
they were beaten back by a garage worker armed with a metal pole			0
mr @entity116 said that the following day , the local community ‘ got together and decided they had to protect their businesses ’ when nightfall arrived , in order to ‘ prevent further looting ’			1
up to 100 @entity157 men had gathered on the streets armed with sticks , bats and batons from around 9.30pm on the evening of august 9			0
the court was shown footage of a rock being thrown at a @entity261 belonging to @entity38 's brother , @entity262 , has he turned into @entity263			0
the court was told there was then a flurry of calls between the two brothers and their associates			0
within minutes , the @entity14 , @entity93 and @entity99 were on the scene			0
the court heard @entity38 later claimed : ' we all went down there to back him ( brother @entity262 ) up '			0
mr @entity116 said ' perfectly legitimate questions ' could be asked about whether the conduct of some of the @entity157 was lawful			0
but he added : ' we do suggest that there was a genuine desire amongst many if not all of them to protect their businesses and livelihoods			0
‘ they lived in the area , they depended on the businesses in the area to survive			0
‘ the prosecution are here to put before you what we say was murderous conduct			0
‘ whatever one 's view about the actions of both sides of the divide , the prosecution say that the driving , the heart of the case , the driving which culminated in three deaths was out of any sensible proportion to anything that had gone on before and that conduct , that driving was murder and nothing less			0
