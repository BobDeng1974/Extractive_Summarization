by @entity0 for @entity1 a 23 - month - old girl can not eat after she was born with her intestines growing on the outside of her body			1
@entity6 has never enjoyed a bite of food , as a result of the crippling bowel condition , gastroschisis			1
she is fed by a tube directly into her stomach , and has to carry a back - pack containing a line of medicine and food			1
@entity18 has faced multiple operations since she was born , to try and correct the problem , but she will only be able to eat properly once she has had an intestine transplant			1
@entity6 , 23 months , ( pictured with her mother @entity22 ) was born with her intestines growing outside her body			1
the condition is called gastroschisis and means @entity18 is unable to eat as soon as she was born , doctors began to treat @entity18 's condition			1
in her short life , the 23 - month - old has had multiple operations to push her intestines back inside her abdomen and close the abdominal wall but the toddler , who lives in @entity33 in @entity34 , will have to wait at least another two years before experts at @entity36 can attempt the procedure			1
the hospital is one of only two in the world where the operation is available			0
@entity18 's mother , @entity22 , 26 , said : ' we are desperately hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed at the moment			1
' @entity18 's gastroschisis meant miss @entity22 was unable to breastfeed her daughter			1
and instead of starting to eat solids when other babies would , the toddler has been fed through a tube through her nose since birth			2
for the first 14 months of her life , home for @entity18 was the @entity59 for @entity60			0
in june , doctors tried to stimulate her bowel to work by narrowing it			0
for the first 14 months of her life , the @entity59 for @entity60 was @entity18 's home but the 23 - month - old still has two tubes taking nutrients directly to her stomach and small intestine			1
a gastrostomy tube replaced the tube in her nose and a @entity79 tube goes direct to her intestine			0
she has had seven operations and managed to return home to miss @entity22 and her father @entity84 last november			1
but unfortunately the operation to fit the tubes in june was unsuccessful and @entity87 said they are ‘ back to square one '			0
' she is still not feeding so we are going back to @entity91 next week for tests to see why it did n’t work , ' she said			0
' she is comfortable at hospital and still goes to @entity96 ’s @entity95 for check ups as well as going to @entity91 for surgery			0
' we are hoping to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed. if we can do that then we can progress from there			2
' we are hoping that it will be this month or next or in the spring at the latest but it just depends in what they find and as they will be doing lots of different tests and she may require and operation - we are going in completely blind			1
' but miss @entity22 remains positive and said that on the whole @entity18 is doing really well			2
' she is doing well and will be starting playgroup , ' she said			0
' she is at home but still loves the hospital - every time she goes she seems to pick up more things			0
' i think it is helping her to come on with her development as she is speaking loads			0
' doctors have told miss @entity22 her daughter will require an intestines transplant , if she hopes to feed normally @entity126 is a type of abdominal wall defect that occurs when a child 's intestines do not develop fully while in the womb			1
in the early stages of pregnancy , the intestine develops within the umbilical cord			0
weeks later it moves inside the foetus ' abdomen			2
but where an unborn child has gastroschisis , the abdominal wall does not completely @entity144 results in the intestines growing outside the body			1
around one in 3,000 babies are born with the condition in the @entity149 , each year			0
as soon as the child is born the condition requires immediate treatment			0
within a few hours of birth , the baby is usually transferred to a specialist children 's hospital			0
the first step is for doctor 's to wrap the exposed intestines in a type of ' cling film ' to reduce the amount of fluid and body heat lost			2
it also acts to protect the intestines from further damage			0
once a baby is stable , they will have an operation to put the intestines back inside the abdomen , and close up the abdominal wall			1
it can take several operations to achieve this , placing the intestines back a bit at a time , until they can all be contained			2
for some children , their intestines will recover and start to work properly , allowing them to begin to eat normally			2
for other children , the intestines can experience too much damage during the process , meaning further treatment is required			0

@entity6 was born with her intestines outside her body
she was *diagnosed* with gastroschisis - which means her abdominal wall failed to close properly inside the womb
she has had multiple operations to place her intestines inside her abdomen and to close the hole in her abdominal wall
23 - month - old is fed by a tube and will require an intestines transplant
her mother @entity22 , said : ' we are desperately trying to find a way to feed her as she needs to be tube fed at the moment '
