there is a new hot young thing taking the @entity2 by storm			0
here @entity4 tells you all you need to know about this exciting teenage talent			0
who is this whippet winger at @entity9 i ’m hearing about ? @entity11 is his name			1
his reputation has been bubbling away for a season or so but he announced himself to the @entity2 with a fine hat - trick against @entity16 in the 6 - 1 win at @entity18 ’s			1
tell me more … he has come through the same @entity9 youth system that produced @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and was given his debut by @entity24 as a late sub in october 2013 aged 17 and 95 days			1
@entity11 ( right ) celebrates smashing a hat - trick against @entity16 on saturday he is blessed with frightening pace , an ability to dribble , and good technique , although before his recent goals he had scored only twice in 25 appearances ( albeit mainly from the bench )			1
who has he been compared to ? @entity20 is the obvious example because of their @entity9 connection , but he shares a similar style and stature also to @entity39 , admittedly with far to go before possibly reaching the @entity42 player ’s level			1
what ’s his story ? born in @entity9 , @entity11 attended @entity45 in the south of the city			2
his sugary touch found an adequate platform through @entity50 , a team connected to the @entity52 - based chocolate factory			0
at 11 he was scouted by @entity9 and has been at their academy ever since			2
@entity11 ( left ) is attracting interest from several @entity57 clubs but has been urged to stay at @entity9 @entity11 ( left ) seals his hat - trick against @entity16 with a neat finish on saturday he describes himself as ‘ bubbly , calm and happy ’ and says his perfect pre-match meal is egg and toast			1
@entity63 has been his most skillful team - mate			0
talk me through this hat - trick … it came in 34 first - half minutes			1
his first was a burst from central midfield to the edge of the area where he dispatched a low finish into the far corner			0
his second saw him race past two defenders to the right of the area and fire a shot back across goal sooner than keeper @entity81 expected			0
his third was a cool finish from the left after arriving onto @entity86 ’s pass at full speed			0
is he attracting attention from bigger clubs ? certainly , and manager @entity90 is braced for bids in january			0
@entity92 had a £ 500,000 bid rejected on transfer deadline day in the summer , an offer the club saw as vastly inferior to any they might countenance			2
@entity42 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 have all also been linked with monitoring his situation			2
@entity11 has 18 months left on his current deal but has been offered a two - year extension by @entity9 .			1

@entity11 scored hat - trick for @entity9 against @entity16
@entity107 is on the radar of @entity42 , @entity97 and @entity92
@entity11 is similar in style to @entity39 and @entity20
