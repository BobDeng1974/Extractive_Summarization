by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 25 march 2013 former waitress @entity1 is determined to be the best @entity3 lookalike in the world - but the role has just got more complicated thanks to the @entity8 ' pregnancy			1
mother - of - two @entity1 has n't gone to the extreme of getting pregnant again herself but has instead invested in a number of belly prosthetics so she can continue to replicate @entity3 's look			1
' as @entity3 grows i will too - to be authentic i thought it was important , ' she told the @entity15 , adding that she has had a ' bump made in various sizes '			1
' as @entity3 grows , i will too ' : @entity1 , right , has bought baby bumps in different sizes so she can keep copying @entity3 's look			1
the five month pregnant @entity8 is pictured last week , left foresight : @entity1 appeared in a @entity22 article last year predicting @entity3 's pregnancy style , right , and this dress the @entity8 wore in february is remarkably similar @entity1 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , earns £ 650 - a - day as the @entity8 ' doppelganger through public and media appearances			1
the 32 year old single mother has worked hard to mimic @entity3 's clothes , mannerisms and posture since she quit her job at a @entity35 and @entity36 's restaurant to become a professional lookalike			0
no baby on board : @entity1 in her baby bump shows how the @entity8 will look later this year she made the career move after people kept coming up to her convinced she was @entity3			1
she has had to spend some of her earnings on replicating @entity3 's designer wardrobe including buying the blue @entity46 dress @entity3 wore when she and prince @entity47 announced their engagement and a £ 300 copy of her @entity52 evening wedding gown			0
got the look : @entity1 bought the blue @entity46 dress @entity3 wore to announce her engagement , left imitation : @entity1 spent £ 300 on this copy , right , of @entity3 's @entity52 evening wedding dress the duchess is currently five months pregnant and is still not showing much of a bump			2
she has worn clothes she has been pictured in before at recent public appearances - albeit less tightly fitted - so has not yet been seen in maternity clothes			0
as a result , @entity1 said it 's currently not as easy for her to copy @entity3 's style			0
copy @entity3 : the lookalike earns £ 650 - a - day in public and media appearances she said : ' it 's difficult at the moment as she 's not big enough yet to change her entire wardrobe so it 's difficult to see how she 's going to dress it			2
' @entity1 was given a taste of what @entity3 's maternity wear may look like when the @entity22 used her as a model in a ' dressing the royal bump ' fashion piece last year			0
no maternity wear yet : @entity3 still fits into the @entity82 coat she wore to last year 's @entity84 parade , right , so wore it again last week , left , without a belt aside from what clothes to wear , @entity1 , who has a son , @entity90 , 11 and daughter , @entity87 , four , is having to get used to having a baby bump again			2
she wrote on @entity93 earlier this month : ' picked up my ' baby bump ' today , how strange			0
' ' authentic ' : @entity1 , right , copies @entity3 's look down to her jewellery so the @entity8 being pregnant means she 'll also have a bump but despite the fact she 'll have to carry some extra weight for a few months , @entity1 said she has no regrets about becoming a lookalike			1
she said : ' it ’s a huge difference from working in a restaurant and it pays better			0
it ’s a really fun job as i ’m doing something different every day			0

mother - of - two @entity1 will don baby bump to keep her act ' authentic '
she 's had one made in ' various sizes ' so she can copy @entity3 as she grows
she 's finding it ' difficult ' to dress like five - month pregnant @entity8
