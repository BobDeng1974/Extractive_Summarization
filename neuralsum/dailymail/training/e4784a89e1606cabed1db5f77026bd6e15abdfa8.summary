the much - maligned security perimeter at @entity2 ’s busiest airport has failed again after two kayakers claim they washed ashore without being detected by police			1
@entity5 , of suburban @entity6 , and @entity7 , of @entity8 , were kayaking through @entity9 friday evening when their kayak rolled over and they swam to a pier on the property of @entity14 near a scant - used runway			1
no one knew the pair , both 21 , was there until they found a construction worker to call for help because there are no security patrols at night , critics claim			2
no other options : @entity7 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) claim they had no choice but to go to airport land after their @entity28 rolled and they were left with only one paddle @entity7 told the @entity32 that they were ‘ just kayaking at night ’ when their three - man vessel rolled over and they lost two paddles			1
‘ we had one paddle left , ’ @entity7 continued			2
‘ we were going toward the closest spot to shore			2
’ the two men found a dock just off runway 41 , and made their way to safety without being detected by the $ 100million security system in place to thwart such breaches , sources told the paper			1
‘ we were almost drowning			0
we could n’t hang onto the boat , and we were getting pulled under and out , ’ @entity5 told @entity50			2
‘ we found a construction worker , and he said , ‘ are you guys alright ? thank god you ’re alive			0
’ where they landed : on this pier just off runway 41 on the airport 's southern shore on the water : @entity14 is bordered to the south by @entity9 , a waterway with boaters and other locals looking to escape the hustle and bustle of the city the same runway was breached only two years ago when a jetskier ran out of gas , swam to shore , scaled an eight - foot fence and walked across two runways into the airport seeking help , according to the station			1
that man also eluded detection by the perimeter ‘ fence ’s motion sensors			0
‘ you ’ve got a system that is supposed to provide protection , and what happened ? ’ counterterrorism expert @entity84 asked the station			0
‘ once again a perimeter security breach at @entity14 raises serious concerns about the @entity89 ’s @entity88 , ’ a @entity89 police union spokesperson told the @entity32 , ‘ a system the @entity92 believes is a failure			1
’ the @entity89 insisted to @entity50 that ‘ kayakers did not breach the secure airfield			0
they were seeking help in a restricted water area and at a light pier			0
both men were treated for hypothermia at a nearby hospital and charged with trespassing .			0
