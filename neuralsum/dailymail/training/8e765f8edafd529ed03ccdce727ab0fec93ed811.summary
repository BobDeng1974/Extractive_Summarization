hundreds of young @entity5 players around the country are now speaking @entity14 with ease , thanks to greater resources devoted to teaching language skills and other day - to - day tasks in @entity5 life as part of the transition to baseball in the @entity24 ‘ there 's no doubt it 's different today than it was a generation ago for these players , with the media coverage , the impact of social media , the coverage , the television , everything , ’ @entity37 manager @entity36 said			1
‘ these guys are exposed			0
’ the @entity49 say they have increased spending by 400 percent over the past decade			0

@entity36 and several other managers and gms say there are fewer issues in which the language barrier causes their jobs to be more challenging than even five years ago			2
for example , most managers now make their pitching changes without the aid of an interpreter			0
some still prefer an interpreter when sending a player down to the minors or explaining certain technical aspects of a swing , pitching motion or other instruction			0
‘ if there 's something in particular that i need a player to understand and i ca n't have any confusion , i go through an interpreter with the player and i instruct the interpreter to tell him exactly what i say the way i say it , ’ said @entity102 manager @entity101 , who speaks only the most basic @entity62			2
@entity104 instructor @entity103 helps @entity49 baseball pitching prospect @entity105 learn his numbers , in @entity69 , @entity70 ‘ i do n't want your interpretation , because the way i would express it is for effect			2
if you change that effect , you just changed my interpretation			0
’ @entity114 , the @entity31 - born catcher for the @entity49 made learning @entity14 as much a part of his job as studying his pitchers and their tendencies			1
he had to be able to speak with the pitchers , so he took classes on the computer via @entity122 before and after games			0
‘ it 's not just for the position , ’ @entity114 said			0
‘ you 're in another country , a different country and this is like a challenge for you , so you have to take the challenge to survive			0
’ while @entity114 is proving a reliable option as @entity134 's backup in the @entity135 , the future of the franchise - latino minor leaguers - sits in classrooms at the team 's training complex in @entity69 , @entity70 , taking evening @entity14 classes as their empty practice fields are watered outside in the desert heat			1
the @entity49 is just one of many clubs putting a stronger emphasis on teaching @entity14 basics , including training as to writing checks , using a bank account or mailing a letter to young prospects from @entity5 the men walk past @entity154 logos on the walls as they arrive , a reminder of the team 's championships in 2010 and 2012			1
the lessons include @entity14 basics , including training in how to write checks , use a bank account or mail a letter			1
there 's even training on how to conduct a simple telephone call			1

we had to learn from scratch , ’ said 76 - year - old @entity166 , a @entity167 among the first group of @entity170 playing baseball in the @entity24 ‘ ( talking ) with the players , that 's what i did ( to learn )			1
’ @entity103 is the lead @entity14 instructor for the @entity49 ' minor leaguers			1
she regularly fist - bumps players throughout a session to celebrate and encourage their progress			2
during one class this spring , everybody sang @entity184 to work on the simple meanings behind the tune			0
the @entity49 estimate they have helped train 325 @entity59 players with @entity14 skills in the last 15 years , while also providing @entity62 training for those seeking to learn players , much like school children , laugh , talk out of turn , stretch , kick off their flip flops , curl their toes when reading , make faces , or even smile sheepishly when they answer correctly and are given praise			1
a few years back , this was @entity114			0
and he also carved out time in his busy baseball life to take one - on - one classes			2
he started the sessions during his first professional season , rookie ball in 2009 , but took it to another level in 2012			0
‘ i get the opportunity to take @entity14 classes and i take advantage , and tried to learn every day , ’ @entity114 said , his grammar still not perfect but close			1
‘ that 's all about it , getting better , learning			2
that 's how you survive in life			0
’ longtime @entity49 equipment manager @entity216 has nicknamed the affable catcher after actor @entity218 , and @entity114 immediately plays along by pulling off his black @entity49 cap and rubbing his hair - which , while far darker , is almost a spitting image of @entity218 's precisely groomed ' do			2

‘ i understand everything but it 's a little bit difficult to speak it clearly			0
it does n't scare me , but i understand more studying while i listen , ’ he said			0
while @entity236 second baseman @entity235 is at ease speaking fluent @entity14 , the @entity27 star regularly can be seen razzing teammates while speaking @entity62 a mile a minute			2
@entity239 briefly attended high school in @entity241			0
‘ i went to school here , so i learned @entity14 , ’ said @entity239 , who received a $ 240 million , 10 - year contract to join the @entity243 last off - season after nine years with the @entity244			1
‘ but it 's hard speaking your second language			2

@entity6 teams are throwing resources at teaching language skills and other day - to - day tasks to new recruit from @entity5
