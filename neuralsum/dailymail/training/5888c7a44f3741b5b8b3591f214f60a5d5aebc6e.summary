by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 03:09 est , 23 july 2013 as crowds of jubilant well - wishers mobbed the front of @entity4 's tonight to celebrate the birth of the new third - in - line to the throne , the royal couple 's bodyguards made another important delivery out of view			1
@entity7 close - protection officers were seen delivering two pizzas to the rear entrance to the hospital where the @entity16 gave birth to her son this afternoon			1
the snacks will be well - needed			0
@entity16 endured a labour of nearly half a day to deliver the baby boy , who was born at 4.24pm gmt weighing a healthy 8lb 6oz			2
a much needed delivery ... one of the @entity24 and @entity16 of @entity26 's close - protection officers turns up with two pizzas from @entity28 's at 8.45pm , after leaving 10 minutes before the announcement of the royal birth she earned it : the @entity24 and @entity16 pictured in december			1
she will be in need of carbohydrates to build up her depleted energy reserves after 11 hours in labour giving birth to their son the plain - clothes policeman arrived at the discreet back entrance to @entity4 's at 8.45pm , having left ten minutes before the @entity42 made the announcement of the royal birth			1
his timing suggests that , having given themselves several hours private time after the birth of their son , the @entity24 and @entity16 are now ready to settle down and observe the national celebration their happy arrival has prompted			1
after her 11 - hour labour , @entity16 will need to stock up her body with carbohydrates , with a pizza the ideal source of sustenance to top up her depleted energy reserves			1
without eating soon after the struggle of giving birth , there is the risk her body could go into ketosis - where the body starts burning fat for energy - which can lead to nausea , vomiting and headaches			1
@entity67 , @entity16 and their child are to spend the night together on the private @entity70 at @entity4 's , where specialists can make sure everything is okay			0
meanwhile , at the front of @entity4 's : self - proclaimed @entity75 @entity74 celebrates among the crowd outside the hospital after the birth of the @entity80 ' new son was revealed to the world big day for @entity82 : well - wishers wearing outfits emblazoned with the national flag celebrate the birth of the new @entity7 baby outside the @entity87 at @entity88 in @entity89 outside , waiting @entity7 fans burst into celebration when the news was announced			2
self - appointed town crier @entity74 stood in full ceremonial dress to lead the party as dozens of others dressed in @entity98 regalia danced and sang in the streets			0
the first indication many of those waiting in the streets may have had was when @entity103 aide @entity103 emerged from the front doors of @entity4 's carrying a document in a folder which he passed to a waiting driver			0
the document was then rushed across central @entity108 to @entity109 , where the @entity111 's press secretary @entity110 with @entity112 , a footman , placed the official document on an easel in view of crowds waiting there			0
but in a digital age where news travels almost instantaneously , waiting well - wishers had an advance warning of the revelations			0
the waiting crowds cheer as the @entity111 's press secretary @entity110 with @entity112 a footman place on an easel in the @entity127 a notification , to announce the birth of a baby boy one man shouted : ' it 's a boy , ' prompting crowds to erupt into spontaneous cheering , ahead of the easel being placed in the forecourt			2
there were three cheers of ' hip hip hooray , ' as the crowd outside the palace gates swelled to more than 10 deep			2
euphoric fans sang happy birthday , welcoming the new prince into the world			0
but unaware of the the scenes of jubilation he has caused , the newest addition to the royal family will be in the loving arms of his parents as they come to terms with their new life as a family .			0
