more and more players seem to be swapping shirts early at half time , but @entity4 captain @entity3 got a step ahead of his team - mates : by appearing to ask @entity7 for his shirt at the traditional pre-match handshake			1
the 33 - year - old @entity11 midfielder saw the opportunity to get hold of one of the most in demand shirts of the @entity16 and looks to have popped the question to the @entity19 superstar minutes before kick off in @entity20			0
a number of players have been spotted swapping shirts at half time in @entity24 - but @entity3 set a new record by potentially nabbing @entity7 's shirt after the coin toss in what will most likely be @entity4 's biggest game of the @entity16			2
and if @entity3 's move was a distraction technique against the four - time @entity53 winner - his mind games seemed to be working well , so far , with @entity4 holding the @entity19 at 0 - 0 at half time			1
but the @entity56 forward finally managed to win the game for @entity33 , grabbing a 90th minute winner to break @entity4 hearts			0
do n't ruin the shirt ! @entity7 rues a missed chance in the first half as @entity33 struggled to break @entity4 down			0
