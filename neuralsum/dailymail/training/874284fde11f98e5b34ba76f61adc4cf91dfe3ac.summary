the @entity1 government has warned @entity3 and @entity4 users to be on the alert for hackers who may exploit a vulnerability in @entity9 that would enable them to steal sensitive data			1
cybersecurity firm @entity12 says the bug enables hackers to access their devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages , emails and web links			1
network security company , @entity12 disclosed the vulnerability behind the ' @entity54 ' earlier this week , saying it had been exploited to launch a campaign dubbed ' @entity61 ' and that more attacks could follow			0
hackers could potentially steal login credentials , access sensitive data stored on @entity9 devices and remotely monitor activity on those devices , the government said			2
such attacks could be avoided if @entity4 and @entity3 users only installed apps from @entity34 's @entity33 or from their own organizations , it said			1
users should not click ' install ' from pop - ups when surfing the web			1
if @entity9 flashes a warning that says ' @entity45 , ' users should click on ' @entity47 ' and immediately uninstall the app , the bulletin said			2
if installed , the malicious application can then be used to replace genuine , trusted apps that were installed through @entity34 's @entity33 , including email and banking programs , with malicious software through a technique that @entity12 has dubbed ' @entity54			1
' these attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data , according to @entity12 , which is well - regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research			2
' it is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit , ' @entity12 senior staff research scientist @entity94 said in an interview			2
@entity94 said that @entity12 disclosed the vulnerability to @entity34 in july and that representatives with the company have said they were working to fix the bug			1
an @entity34 spokesman told @entity103 : ' we designed @entity105 and @entity9 with built - in security safeguards to help protect customers and warn them before installing potentially malicious software			1
' we ’re not aware of any customers that have actually been affected by this attack			0
' we encourage customers to only download from trusted sources like the @entity33 and to pay attention to any warnings as they download apps			1
' enterprise users installing custom apps should install apps from their company ’s secure website			1
' more information is available from the firm 's support page			0
news of the vulnerability began to leak out in october on specialized web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on @entity34 bugs , @entity94 said @entity94 said that @entity12 disclosed the vulnerability to @entity133 and that representatives with the company have said theywere working to fix the bug			2
last week researchers warned of a major threat called @entity61			0
@entity61 monitors @entity9 devices , including ipods , iphones and @entity4 , connected to a @entity141 via usb			0
the virus begins by infecting the @entity145 software , through malicious files or links			0
when a device is connected to this infected @entity141 , the malware automatically installs malicious apps onto the phone or tablet			2
the researchers said this malware combines a number of techniques to successfully ' realise a new brand of threat to all @entity9 devices '			0
the experts suggest @entity9 and @entity141 owners only download apps from the official @entity34 app store , and that they make sure to keep their software up to date			1
@entity94 said that @entity12 decided to go public with its findings after @entity167 last week uncovered the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability , a new family of malicious software known as @entity61 that infects both @entity141 computers and @entity9			2
@entity12 does not know of other attacks that exploit the bug , @entity94 said			0
' currently @entity61 is the only one , but we will see more , ' he said			0
@entity12 advises @entity9 users to refrain from install apps from sources other than @entity34 's official @entity33 and to not click ' install ' on a pop - up from a third - party web page			1
the security firm said it verified this vulnerability on @entity185 , 7.1.2 , 8.0 , 8.1 and 8.1.1 beta , for both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices			0
the firm used the exploit to replace @entity191 's @entity190 app with a rogue version			1
' in one of our experiments , we used an in - house app with a bundle identifier ' @entity198 ' with a title ' @entity200 '			0
' we signed this app using an enterprise certificate			0
when we installed this app from a website , it replaced the original @entity190 app on the phone			0

' *masque* attack ' can replace real apps with malicious version that *siphon* off data
can only be loaded if users *choose* to install from outside @entity33
@entity34 says no users have been hit by exploit
