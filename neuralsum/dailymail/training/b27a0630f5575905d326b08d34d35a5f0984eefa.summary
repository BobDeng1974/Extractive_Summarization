by @entity0 published : 20:31 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 08:03 est , 25 january 2014 row : the interlude between beach belle mrs @entity3 , here soaking up the sun in a @entity7 bikini in 2011 , has highlighted her penchant for product placement with a footballer husband who reportedly earns £ 26,000 a day , @entity3 can certainly afford to splash out on a new bikini or two for her next exotic holiday			1
yet it seems the 27 - year old proves the old adage that those who can afford to pay for things do n’t have to			0
for while mrs @entity3 and her husband , @entity19 striker @entity18 , have a combined wealth of £ 64 million , that has not stopped her from accepting free gifts from everyone from designer clothes brands to @entity25 — much to the disgust of her online followers			1
within moments of @entity3 sending a gushing tweet thanking celebrity fashion designer @entity7 for the free swimwear she had received last week , the @entity28 was lambasted by her @entity33 followers for accepting freebies — and for gleefully parading them online			1
@entity3 ’s tweet : ‘ thank you @ melissaodabash for my gorgeous bikinis ! ! i absolutely love them ! ! x ’ sparked an angry backlash , with one commentator asking : ‘ millionaire husband and still accepting freebies , do you not feel bad when there ’s people who ca n’t pay their gas bill ? ’ she was also branded ‘ fat and dumpy ’ by one @entity33 user , after being photographed in a similar luxury two - piece swimsuit , also by @entity7			1
others criticised as ‘ unreal ’ her ‘ endless ’ product placement on the social networking site , while one user said she was ‘ sickened ’ by @entity3 ’s actions			1
the row saw mrs @entity3 retaliate by telling one of her critics : ‘ go and try and blag yourself a bikini you sad cow ! ! ’ the unedifying exchange highlighted mrs @entity3 ’s endless plugs for freebies ranging from spa vouchers to designer goodies and baby clothes			1
so when @entity3 is n’t tweeting her thanks for a free gift or product , she is using the social network to promote her own clothing lines with @entity86 and @entity87			2
but it was all finally too much for some of her 1,083,297 followers , and last monday one of them took umbrage with her tweet to @entity7 , pointing out the star had again endorsed ‘ another freebie ’			0
if the shoes fits : usually seen in high heels , @entity3 gushed about a new pair of @entity100 , and tressed to impress ( right ) she praises @entity101 for creating this braid in august again , mrs @entity3 shows off her @entity100 mrs @entity3 defended her tweets , claiming that even rich people deserve freebies with the post : ‘ no it ’s nice for people to gift people whether they have a lot or nothing ! not going to get anywhere being negative in life			1
you are one bitter person ! ! i do n’t ask for things ! ’ while expecting her second son @entity116 , now nine months old , mrs @entity3 received a haul of free baby essentials from @entity120 store @entity25 — and promptly sent a tweet to her followers ‘ got some great stuff from@mothercareuk for our new baby ! ! thank you ! ! ’ the couple ’s five - year - old son , @entity125 , has n’t missed out either			1
wearing it well : @entity3 dons a white jacket and trousers to promote not a freebie , but her own @entity86 fashion collection this month splash of colour : posting a selfie of a shirt from her @entity86 collection in december in august @entity3 tweeted a message to luxury childrenswear boutique @entity138 , which stocks mini @entity141 and @entity143 , thanking them for the outfits she ’d received for her boys			2
@entity3 also posts endless gushing messages of thanks for items she claims to have paid for herself			2
in april she tweeted ‘ loving my new converse ! thanks ! ’ , while she has also posted fawning messages about hairstylists , protein drinks and clothes by label @entity154			0
while @entity3 ’s representatives refused to give an official comment , they did claim that , in all of these cases , she paid for the items herself			2
it is not known whether she paid the full price , however			0
in june 2012 , @entity3 ’s husband @entity18 was also criticised for endorsing products on his @entity33 account			0
the @entity168 forward was censured by the @entity169 for passing off an advertisement for @entity171 as a personal comment			0
according to @entity169 rules , celebrities endorsing products on @entity33 should really use hashtags such as # spons ( for sponsor ) or # ad to clarify that they ’re doing so			0
yesterday the @entity169 claimed that , as mrs @entity3 was not paid cash to send the tweets , she had not breached their guidelines			1
spokesman @entity184 said : ‘ any tweet that is paid for and controlled must be disclosed , i.e. made clear it ’s an ad			0
‘ it ’s important to mention that the actual buck stops with the advertiser			0
' if we received a complaint that a @entity33 was misleading because it did n’t make clear the content was advertising we would investigate the advertiser , not the celebrity who has tweeted			0

mrs @entity3 *blasted* followers for saying they *'re* ' sickened ' by promotions
interlude highlighted *constant* stream of plugs for designers and offers
