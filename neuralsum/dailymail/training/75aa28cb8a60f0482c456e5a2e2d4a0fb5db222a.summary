but according to @entity10 star @entity3 , the @entity9 could triumph in the competition once again – if we just came up with a decent song			1

rock veteran @entity23 had to settle for 19th place last year with her song @entity26 , and our worst result was in 2003 when @entity29 failed to record a single point			0
unknown @entity31 will be flying the flag at this year ’s contest in @entity35 on may 10			0
sir @entity36 , who presented the tv coverage of the event for nearly 30 years , dismissed claims that the @entity9 was doomed to fail because of partisan voting by @entity42 countries and said all the @entity9 needed was a chart - topping act to take part			2
‘ if we could put @entity46 on stage , we would have an outstanding chance , ’ he said			0
@entity3 ( right ) says that ' the best song wins ' and that the @entity9 needs to find their best songwriters to stand a chance			1
