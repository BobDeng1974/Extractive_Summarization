actor @entity0 has been criticised after accusing @entity1 of not telling the full story actor @entity0 has accused his former friend , @entity1 of not telling the ' full story ' in his interview about the depression that led to his suicide attempt last year			1
the @entity8 star said @entity1 was going to ' get away with it again ' in reference to his interview about a battle with depression that caused him to step in front of a lorry days before @entity16			1
@entity0 tweeted a picture of the article , commenting : ' oh dear			1
looks like @entity1 's going to get away with it - again			1
' his comment was met with a barrage of criticism from @entity26 users , who accused him of being ' crass ' and ' insensitive '			1
the actor wrote : ' seems people want context about previous tweet			2
so let me say , i know the full story and it 's not what 's portrayed in the media			2
' @entity0 and @entity1 had become friends in the early 2000s , but are thought to have fallen out when the footballer took the actor 's bank card to fill @entity0 's car with petrol			1
instead , according to @entity1 's autobiography , he used the card to fund a drinking spree			1
little did not refer to the incident , thought to have taken place in 2003 , but admitted on @entity26 that he should not have used such a forum to make the comment			2
instead he wrote at length on the @entity52 site to explain his view			2
the actor explained that he and @entity1 ' have history ' , and that while he wishes @entity56 a strong recovery he does not feel sad for him any more			1
however , he added he felt ' sad , and maybe a little angry ' for @entity1 's wife @entity58 , the footballer 's children , and the lorry driver			1
he added that the former footballer had been in touch with him to offer ' a retrospective apology over things that went on a long time ago ' , but said he had been ' drained ' of sympathy for him			2
@entity0 wrote : ' there comes a point where it 's just frustrating to witness someone constantly hammering the pattern of destruction for those around - and i was once one of those around - only to see the destructive force make a moving and sincere apology ... then do it again			1
' @entity1 was pictured for the first time since leaving hospital after after a collision with a lorry @entity0 felt ' sad , and maybe a little angry ' for @entity1 's wife @entity58 ( pictured ) , his children , and the lorry driver he added : ' though , as a final thought , i would say again , i ’m a fool for forgetting that @entity26 is not , and never will be , the place for a comment like that			1
it ’s too reductive and simplistic , and yes , without context , i can see it would seem insensitive and crass			2
' @entity1 later responded to the actor 's tweets using his wife @entity58 ’s account			1
he wrote : ' hi @entity0 , it ’s @entity1 here			1
i have seen you once in 10 years , and that was to apologise for my repulsive behaviour as a young man			1
' i know you have you 're right to your opinion , but i 've got to say , i sincerely hope that you 're not the same person you were 10 years ago , as i very much am not			0
i hope you are well , happy and enjoying your excellent career			0
i pray depression never bites x ' in his autobiography , @entity105 , but ... : a @entity108 , @entity1 wrote about his friendship with @entity0			1
he explained in his book that he had befriended @entity0 and his two housemates - a radio producer and band manager - after realising that he needed to make friends outside of football in order to keep his heavy drinking a secret from his team - mates			1
describing @entity0 as a ' very self - assured guy ' , @entity1 wrote that for his new friend ' everything had an element of competition , whether it was drinking , dancing , women , @entity127 , income , level of fame , everything			1
' the actor had posted a series of tweets including one which read ' oh dear			2
looks like @entity1 's going to get away with it - again ' he added : ' this triggered two things within me			1
firstly , i wanted to be liked by all of these guys			0
this meant that i would say yes to everything			0
if there was a party i was there , a drink to be had i was there , an event to be seen at i was there			0
i wanted to be a part of the group			0
secondly , i wanted to win			0
this may sound pathetic , but it is where i was at			0
i wanted to be cooler , i wanted to party harder , i wanted to be richer ( or look richer if i was n't ) , i wanted to impress him and everyone around us			0
' @entity1 also said @entity0 was ' desperate to be a footballer and genuinely believed he was good enough , ' which had in turn spurred him on to live the actor 's lifestyle and be a professional footballer			1
speaking of the bank card incident he wrote : ' it was so bad in my drinking days that at one point @entity0 lent me his bank card to get some petrol for his car , but i took it to go on a bender for a couple of days , helping myself to cash out of his personal account			1
in his autobiography @entity1 had written that @entity0 , pictured at a @entity178 event , was ' desperate to be a footballer and believed he was good enough ' ' i still cringe to this day when i think back to some of those times when i was at my most desperate			1
' it is part of my recovery programme to try to make amends to all those who you have wronged on your journey			0
' i have repeatedly repented to all of my housemates , some of whom accepted it and some of whom did n't			0
i 'm fine about that - just because i apologise does n't make everything better			0
i had to face the consequences of my actions , which in this case meant i lost several friendships that i will never get back			0
' @entity1 was left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of december 22 on the @entity202 , near @entity203			2
