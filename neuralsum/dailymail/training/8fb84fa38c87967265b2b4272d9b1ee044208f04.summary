@entity1 's best - laid plans for the @entity2 were in tatters on sunday night as @entity4 and @entity5 joined a growing list of casualties in danger of missing the opener against @entity10			1
a weekend of ferocious @entity12 club matches has left head coach @entity13 with concerns about the health of several leading men			0
having already been forced to accept the absence of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , there is a danger that the national team will also be without @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity4 and @entity27 in @entity28 on february 6			1
there was a scare involving @entity1 ’s first - choice fly - half , @entity32 , who went off for concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during @entity36 ’s victory over @entity37			1
he was able to return to action after passing the tests , but his condition is sure to be further assessed by the @entity1 medical staff after he reports for @entity44 training today , along with the rest of the @entity47 squad			1
@entity4 suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from @entity51 's @entity50 @entity36 centre @entity5 lasted only six minutes against @entity37 after being forced off with a ' stinger ' @entity32 ( left ) had to undergo concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during @entity36 's win on sunday @entity4 has not had much luck with injuries this season and has had little playing time as a result			1
the @entity63 fly - half has played 913 minutes in 16 matches for club and country this season ( an average of 57.06 minutes per game )			2
the prospects for @entity4 , @entity71 ’s rival for the no 10 shirt and likely understudy at the @entity74 , appear grim after he was injured playing against @entity51 yesterday			2
he walked off just 15 minutes into the 18 - 6 defeat , having fallen awkwardly as he was tackled by @entity76			0
the @entity63 ’ stand - off looks doubtful for the encounter with @entity10 after he was seen leaving the @entity79 on crutches with his left knee in a brace			2
asked if the 23 - year - old would be fit for the start of the @entity2 , @entity63 ’ director of rugby @entity84 said : ‘ i would n’t want to say right now			2
it ’s a knee injury and we do n’t know the extent of it just yet			0
it ’s complicated with knee injuries , but we ’ll get him looked after and we ’ll know within the next few days			0
’ @entity92 lock @entity26 picked up a knee injury against @entity94 and will be out for three to four weeks @entity63 lock @entity95 looks set to start alongside @entity96 against @entity10 in @entity28 the injuries to @entity71 and @entity4 could open the door for @entity100 ’s @entity99 to stake his claim to being more than fourth - choice fly - half			1
@entity5 was forced off with a sore left shoulder in the sixth minute of @entity36 ’s clash with @entity37 and the @entity106 ’s director of rugby , @entity105 , suggested his centre had suffered a ‘ stinger ’ for the second successive weekend			1
‘ he came off last weekend with a shoulder ( injury ) and he took another knock today but it does n’t look too bad , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’ll go for a scan tomorrow			0
’ @entity25 , @entity1 ’s first - choice blindside flanker , hobbled off early in the second half as @entity116 were beaten at home by @entity118 and his director of rugby , @entity119 , said : ‘ @entity25 has twisted his ankle			1
he was certainly sore and it was sensible to bring him off			0
’ @entity116 blindside @entity25 limped off with an ankle injury during his side 's loss to @entity118 @entity26 — who was seemingly destined to start at lock in @entity28 — suffered a knee injury playing for @entity92 in @entity128 on saturday and initial estimates were that he would be out for three or four weeks			1
his fellow @entity130 , @entity131 , is destined to come into the squad while @entity95 of @entity63 could start after serving a ban for a dangerous tackle earlier this month			1
@entity116 captain @entity135 , meanwhile , has bemoaned his treatment by officials after he was harshly sin - binned for a technical offence on saturday , having recently returned from his latest suspension			0
saints and @entity1 hooker @entity135 watches on at @entity141 after his sin - binning on saturday the @entity1 hooker , who has had several disciplinary episodes during his career , said : ‘ just imagine being me			2
i knew the spotlight would be on me			0
‘ a player runs over me and i put my arms up and i tackle him			0
the next thing you know , i ’m watching the game			0
‘ maybe i am being judged differently but that ’s my own doing and i ’m the one who has got to deal with it			0

@entity1 face @entity10 in @entity28 on the opening weekend of the @entity2
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity4 and @entity5 are all injury doubts for the clash with @entity160 's side on february 6
@entity36 fly half @entity32 was injured against @entity37 on sunday
@entity32 , however , returned to the action after passing concussion test
@entity92 lock @entity131 looks set to be called up to the squad
@entity95 could start at lock alongside @entity96
