@entity0 drifted back to the outfield wall , just like he 'd done in batting practice so many times before , baseball 's greatest closer tracking down another fly ball with childlike joy			1
everything changed before anybody could blink			2
the @entity10 ' 12 - time all - star caught his cleat where the grass meets the warning track in @entity14 , his right knee buckling before he hit the wall			1
@entity0 landed on the dirt , his face contorted in pain , as @entity20 uttered the words ' oh , my @entity22 ' from some 400 feet away			1
manager @entity43 had been watching from behind the batter 's box and set off at a run down the third - base line , angling toward centre field and his fallen reliever			2
' my thought was he has a torn ligament , by the way he went down , ' @entity43 said later			2
@entity0 was diagnosed with a torn acl and meniscus thursday night after an mri exam taken during the @entity10 ' 4 - 3 loss to the @entity58			1
the injury likely ends his season , and quite possibly his career , an unfathomable way for one of the most decorated pitchers in history to go out			1
' it 's not a good situation , but again , we 've been through this before , and we 're being tested one more time , ' @entity0 said , pausing to compose himself in the @entity10 ' clubhouse			1
' it 's more mentally than physical , you know ? you feel like you let your team down			2
' a little help from my friends : other @entity10 rushed to his side and offered what help they could assistance : @entity10 manager @entity43 , right , helps @entity0 , top centre , after @entity0 twisted his right knee taken away : the @entity10 closer was hauled off on a @entity86 tractor with his leg elevated the 42 - year - old @entity0 has said that he 'll decide after the season whether hang it up after 18 years in the major leagues			1
' at this point , i do n't know			2
going to have to face this first			2
it all depends on how the rehab is going to happen , and from there , we 'll see			2
' - @entity0 on whether the injury will end his career and while @entity43 said he hopes that baseball 's career saves leader makes a comeback , @entity0 sounded as if retirement is a very real possibility			1
' at this point , i do n't know , ' he said in a whisper			2
' going to have to face this first			2
it all depends on how the rehab is going to happen , and from there , we 'll see			0
' the injury seemed to cast a pall over the @entity10 , who played from behind the entire way thursday night			1
they put the tying run on third base in the ninth inning before @entity122 made a stellar play on a chopper by @entity20 , throwing him out by a step to preserve the win			0
afterward , the only thing on @entity20 's mind was @entity0			1
' i saw it all go down , ' @entity20 said			0
' it 's hard even to talk about it tonight			0
i mean , @entity0 has meant so much to us on a personal level , and his significance on the field , on the mound			1
but the bottom line is we 're the @entity10 , and nobody is going to feel sorry for us			1
' sitting tight : @entity0 was taken on the field in a tractor and was later taken off for evaluation casting doubt : speaking to reporters later , @entity0 said he does n't know whether the injury will allow him to return to baseball there 's a much different feeling about @entity0 , though			1
one of the most durable pitchers to ever play the game is well - liked and universally respected			2
that 's what happens when you save 608 games and have five @entity157 rings			0
' you 're talking about somebody who does something that 's never been done , ' said @entity160 , who had four hits in the game			2
' it 's not like somebody comes along the next day and does it			0
' @entity160 said that @entity0 has been shagging balls for ' 20 - some years , ' at least as long as they 've known each other			1
it never crossed the captain 's mind that @entity0 would get hurt tracking down a fly ball in batting practice			1
it 's just something that people had come to accept			0
' that 's his conditioning			0
he 's always shagging balls , ' @entity160 said			0
' he 's like a centre fielder anyway			0
it was a freak thing			0
there 's no other way you can explain it			0
' @entity43 also defended @entity0 's decision to shag balls in batting practice , pointing out that the reliever had n't been on the disabled list since 2003 , and reasoning that @entity0 may never have become the same shutdown closer if not for all the work he put in before games			1
@entity194 eyes : pictured april 9 , @entity0 sits in the dugout before a baseball game against the @entity197 in @entity197			1
@entity0 was examined by @entity58 associate physician dr. @entity198 and @entity10 trainers , and was set for an mri at @entity201 the closer : @entity0 , seen again on the april 9 game against the @entity197 , is a 12 - time all - star for the @entity10 ' you have freak injuries , and this is one of them , ' @entity43 said			1
' we had a guy carrying a box down the stairs that broke his foot			0
you can fall off a curb			0
you have to allow him to be an athlete and a baseball player and have fun out there			0
i 've never seen @entity0 do anything recklessly , or seen @entity0 dive to try to rob a home run			1
it 's the way he exercises			0
' @entity43 was too far away from the outfield wall to see what happened , but he knew that @entity0 had sustained a significant injury when he saw players and coaches gathering around him			1
@entity0 grabbed immediately at his right knee and started rubbing it , stopping only to briefly cover his face with his glove			1
@entity40 and @entity43 eventually carried @entity0 to a cart brought onto the field , gently setting him into the back with his knee propped up			1
' at first i thought he was being funny , but then i realized that he was injured , he was down , and that 's when i really got worried , ' said @entity237 , who made his first major league start thursday night			0
' there 's nothing i can do but stand there and watch			0
it 's a miserable feeling			0
' the cart rounded the warning track before disappearing up a tunnel , and @entity0 did n't put any weight on his knee when he was helped back into the @entity10 ' clubhouse			1
high five : @entity10 closing pitcher @entity0 and @entity249 , right , celebrate their win over the @entity197 on april 30 at @entity251 he was examined by @entity58 associate physician dr. @entity198 , but it was n't until the mri exam was taken at @entity254 that head physician dr. @entity255 made the diagnosis			1
' i thought it was n't that bad , but it 's torn , ' @entity0 said			1
' have to fix it			0
' @entity43 said that @entity0 would be reexamined by the @entity10 ' physicians , but @entity0 said that he would rather remain with the team in @entity14 than fly back to @entity263 on friday			1
the @entity10 play three more against the @entity58 before a day off			1
' if it 's going to happen , it 's going to happen doing something i love to do			0
and shagging i love to do , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'd do the same thing , without hesitation			0
the reasons why it happen , you have to take it as it is			0
you know , just have to fight			0
' @entity0 is only the latest closer to go down with a significant injury this season			1
the @entity58 ' @entity278 , the @entity280 ' @entity279 and the @entity282 ' @entity281 all required @entity284 surgery			0
golden arm : @entity0 is seen pitching against the @entity286 in the ninth inning of the april 23 game in @entity289 , @entity290 @entity294 's @entity293 is out with a strained elbow , @entity292 's @entity291 had surgery to repair a ligament in his right thumb , and @entity300 's @entity299 had a bone chip removed from his elbow , though the @entity303 expect him to pitch this season			1
of course , none of those players has nearly the pedigree of @entity0			2
with the same devastating cutter that has carried him for years , @entity0 has made at least 60 appearances each of the last nine seasons			2
he blew a save on opening day this year , but allowed only two hits in eight scoreless innings after that , picking up five of his 608 saves			0
' i always argued he was the best pitcher of all - time , ' first baseman @entity249 said			2
' not just the best reliever , but the best pitcher of all - time			2
that 's all i can say			0
you can get hurt getting out of bed , literally			0
you can get hurt doing anything , ' @entity249 said			0
part of what makes him great is he 's so athletic , and he loves to run around out there and have fun			0
you ca n't play this game for 15 - plus years without having fun			2
it was just a tough accident			0

@entity10 pitcher @entity0 tore acl and meniscus during practice before game in @entity14
seen writing in pain on the field
@entity344 said to reporters he does n't know whether or not injury will end his career
