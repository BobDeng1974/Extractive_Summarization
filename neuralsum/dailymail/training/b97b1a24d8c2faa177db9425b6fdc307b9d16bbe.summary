by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 27 june 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 27 june 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 's character on girls , is not known for having a designer wardrobe ; in fact , her constant mooching off friends and flitting from job to job would suggest exactly the opposite			2
yet in recent photos taken during filming of the @entity15 show 's upcoming third season , the actress is seen wearing a mcq by @entity18 dress , which retails at full price for $ 1,165			2
while @entity1 does get more into character by accessorizing the graphic look with a pair of well - worn sneakers , the graphic print frock is a far cry from the frumpy looks she donned in earlier seasons			2
out of character ? @entity2 was spotted in a chic mcq by @entity18 frock while shooting the upcoming season of @entity3 - a far cry from her character @entity1 's usual frumpy looks pricey : the dress retails for $ 1,165 , which @entity1 surely could n't afford with her frugal lifestyle			1
but stylist @entity36 said that a ' chic dress ' is part of that episode 's story - and that she found it on the sale rack @entity1 - friendly discount : on shopbop.com , the peplum frock is on sale for $ 932 the show 's stylist , @entity36 told @entity47 that @entity1 's chic dress is ' part of the story ' for that particular episode that was being filmed			1
' that dress was a perfect choice , ' she said , adding this is ' probably the only designer piece we 've used on @entity1			0
' the stylist explained that ' thankfully - for the story and for my budget , ' she found it on the sale rack			1
but the designer frock is still markedly more fashion - forward than the somewhat dowdy duds @entity1 typically wears			0
indeed , in january ms @entity36 told the @entity65 that she makes her character appear disheveled on purpose			1
' they do n't quite hit at the right place , ' she said of the clothes @entity1 wears			0
' we mess with the hem lengths so they 're not exactly the best or most flattering length			0
stepping up her fashion game ? the actress was also spotted wearing a cheerful $ 148 @entity79 dress ( left ) on tuesday , and a demure skirt - top combo ( right ) that same day ' we do n't press her clothes , so that they are n't completely put together , ' she explained , adding : ' we 're using the costume to help support her emotional journey			1
' sometimes that means having things dwarf her a little bit , or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because that 's helping to drive the emotion , support the story and reflect what 's going on			0
' ' @entity1 's look is evolving to support her story this season ' indeed , in the fifth episode of season two , @entity1 wore a too - short grey and orange playsuit when she had her dalliance with @entity99 , the doctor			1
while at first it seemed their fling was good for @entity1 , giving her a confidence boost , it all came crashing down at the end of the episode when she cried into his lap , and he consequently lost all interest			0
and who could forget the bright yellow mesh tank top she sported during her cocaine - fulled night out with @entity114 ? you are what you wear : in previous seasons , @entity1 's clothes were often awkward fitting - which , according to girls stylist @entity36 , was actually done on purpose to reflect her ' emotional journey ' disheveled : ms @entity36 explained : ' sometimes [ we make ] things dwarf her a little bit , or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because that 's helping to drive the emotion , support the story and reflect what 's going on ' while she and her roommate seemed to enjoy themselves , the episode came to a head when @entity1 confronted @entity132 about being a ' bad friend '			1
but it seems @entity1 's ' emotional journey ' may have a happy destination after all			0
' she might be almost getting it kind of together , ' ms @entity36 told @entity47			1
' but she is still our @entity1 and still does n't have a ton of money			0
' many of her outfits of late have been markedly more put - together than usual - though not all are as pricey as the @entity144 dress			2
on tuesday , @entity2 was spotted on set in a stylish navy number from anthropologie.the $ 148 dress was adorned with a bright orange cherry pattern , which she topped off with a pair of brown woven flats			0
that same day , the 27 - year - old stepped out in a demure skirt - and - top ensemble with a crisp white collar			0
are things looking up for @entity1 ? ' @entity1 's look is evolving just a bit to support her story this season , ' said ms @entity36			1
' we 're tweaking each of the girls ' looks to keep up with their adventures ' she wore the same well - worn canvas sneakers with this outfit , which included embellished sleeves and a see - through black panel at the hem of the skirt			2
ms @entity36 has said in the past that @entity1 is vintage - driven , which is reflected in her wardrobe , but that she also is the type to save up for pricier items from shops like @entity175 and @entity79			1
whether @entity1 simply saved up for her @entity144 dress , or whether the plot explains her new - found penchant for designer , remains unclear			2
' i do n't want to give anything away , ' said ms @entity36 , adding : ' it was the right dress for the right moment			1
' @entity1 's look is evolving just a bit to support her story this season , ' she said			0
' we 're tweaking each of the girls ' looks to keep up with their adventures			0

girls stylist @entity36 told @entity47 : ' thankfully - for the story and my budget - we discovered the dress on the sale rack '
