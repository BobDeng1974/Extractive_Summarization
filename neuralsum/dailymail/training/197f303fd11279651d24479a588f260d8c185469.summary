by @entity0 published : 02:51 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 06:00 est , 7 may 2013 a man who wanted to claim asylum in @entity3 and said he was a child to avoid deportation was caught out when staff at his children 's home noticed he had facial hair			1
they also thought the @entity10 's deep voice and tattoo were incompatible with his claim of being 12			1
however it took four years until they were able to prove the @entity10 's real age			0

he said : ' a high proportion [ of @entity10 ] claim their mothers told them how old they were a short time before leaving their country			0
' this sounds like a stock phrase and i wonder whether agents advise individuals to say this			0
' the hearing found no evidence of the man being persecuted at home , nor did they track down any relatives , but the judges ruled : ' the applicant 's lack of credibility points strongly towards him being above or very close to attaining the age of maturity when he arrived in the @entity3			2
