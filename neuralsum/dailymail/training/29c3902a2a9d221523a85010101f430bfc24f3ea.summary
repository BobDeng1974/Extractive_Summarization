actually they have started to shrink a little , ' ms @entity34 ' said			0
' i just kind of accepted my condition would get worse and keep growing but i am more optimistic following the discovery			1
' ms @entity6 , who is a size 12 on her top half , has had to deal with her one in seven billion condition her whole life			1
ms @entity34 with the medication she hope may reverse her condition dr @entity46 studies @entity6 over-sized right leg			1
he mapped her dna and found out her condition was unique to her ' there was clearly something dramatically different about me when i was born as my legs were so much bigger than my body			1
doctors did n't know what it was and whisked me away - they did n't let my mother see me for two weeks			2
they did n't think i would survive			0

i find that easier to deal with now			0
