humans through the ages have wondered what it is like to be a bird but now hi - tech headwear has revealed the complex hunting strategies of falcons			1
@entity9 scientists got a bird ’s eye view of falcons ’ attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds , which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights			1
they discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make their attack with precision			1
falcons intercept their prey in mid-air after following it at a distance			2
they keep their target in the centre of their field of vision			0
to conserve energy , falcons readjust their flight position so that their prey appears to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , this helps them predict the future position of their victim			1
falcons are able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tail it in a straightforward way			2
bats and dragonflies use a similar hunting technique			0
researchers from @entity79 , @entity77 explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise			1
the scientists worked with 13 falconers in @entity32 and the @entity9 to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds ’ point of view and painstakingly logged the position of the falcons in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques			2
by comparing the position of the targets in the falcons ' visual field , they were able to map the bird ’s flight path			2
researchers from @entity79 , @entity77 explained that the hunting technique allows falcons ( pictured ) to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise this revealed that if the prey appeared at the centre of the falcon ’s field of view , the falcon was probably intending to attack it from a distance and was keeping an eye its target 's every move			1
however , the birds also used more complicated strategies			0
@entity123 , from the university , told @entity124 , said : ‘ this strategy of heading straight toward the prey at all times is easy to implement , but it involves following a very winding pathway and it turns out to be a very inefficient way of catching prey			0
’ to boost efficiency , the predatory birds readjusted their flight position so that their prey appeared to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , which helped the falcons predict the future position of their victim and conserve energy			1
the falcons were able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tailed it , professor @entity140 said			0
during pursuit , the falcons appeared to head off their prey using a strategy called motion camouflage , meaning they intercept the prey in the least amount of time while also masking its approach			0
the scientists discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make a targeted attack			1
here , the landscape is blurred , but the falcon has zeroed in on its target - the crow ( pictured centre ) researchers from @entity79 , @entity77 ( pictured with professor @entity123 , author of the study , centre ) explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely , to give it the predators the element of surprise previous studies have shown that bats and dragonflies use the same technique			1
professor @entity140 explained that the falconers made special hoods so that the cameras were fixed tightly to the birds ’ heads , but did not impede their view			2
‘ we had some birds who did n't want to wear them , but overall most were unconcerned with the cameras and tolerated the equipment just fine , ’ she said			0
the research , published in the @entity189 , was based upon data from eight different falcons making flights in the @entity9 @entity193 , the @entity194 and the @entity195			0
the scientists now aim on investigating other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour , including how the birds select their victims from a flock			2
professor @entity140 said : ‘ @entity201 are magnificent , charismatic animals and the falcon ’s - eye videos of their hunts are very exciting			0
‘ i can still say that , even though i have spent hours studying them frame by frame using image analysis software			0
‘ this is truly nature red in tooth and claw			0
there is something really primal and moving about watching that elemental struggle between predator and prey			0

falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , allowing them to make targeted attacks on crows
