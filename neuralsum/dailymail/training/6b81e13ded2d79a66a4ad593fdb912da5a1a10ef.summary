exactly a year from thursday , @entity0 will line up against @entity1 in the opening encounter of a home @entity3 which has the potential to profoundly galvanise the sport			1
the national team are steadily on the rise as a global force , but the @entity10 remain the benchmark for all other countries as they prepare to defend their title , and the balance of power is still in the south , with the @entity17 teams continuing their perennial quest to close the gap			1
@entity20 will have the pressurised honour of orchestrating the hosts ’ challenge and he senses that the primary factor will be the drive and focus among his players , in front of their own people			1
‘ to win the top games you need a whole variety of different qualities – technical , physical , mental – but ultimately you need motivation , ’ he told @entity29			1
‘ you need to think , “ what ’s the reason i am going to play for this team ? why is playing for this team special ? ”			2
@entity0 captain @entity40 leads the charge in the quest to win the @entity3 on home turf @entity44 : @entity0 will be ready for @entity3 ‘ you need to pull that together and create an extra 10 or 15 per cent in a player that can take him to a place where he ’ll put his body on the line but also work harder than he has ever worked before			1
that motivation is not a little part of the jigsaw – it ’s a big , big part of the jigsaw			2
it ’s the difference sometimes between winning and losing			2
’ it 's 365 days until the @entity3 kicks off @entity20 is convinced that the @entity58 public will inspire his team and that they in turn can inspire the country , adding : ‘ the support people have for sporting events in this country now is better than anyone ’s in the world			1
‘ i think the fans feel they are supporting a team that is young and ambitious , that wants to have a go and i think the players respond likewise and it becomes a virtuous circle			2
the players love playing at @entity74 , the fans hopefully love watching the team play and i think that is hugely important			2
‘ we have worked hard on talking about the identity of being @entity58			0
you have to have character to be an @entity0 player ; a strong sense of purpose , never take a backwards step , always delivering under pressure , a level of commitment that is probably above and beyond what most people would expect and a resilience that means we are a very difficult team to beat			1
alongside all that , you need those world - class players			0
’ with 12 months to go until the @entity3 begins , here is how the leading eight nations are shaping up for the tournament … @entity0 @entity99 ranking : 4 key man : @entity101 - midfield game - changer there has been notable progress under @entity20 , but the crucial requirement this season is to fine - tune the primary starting xv and establish tangible momentum			1
up front , the pack possess ominous strength in most areas , although @entity113 would still welcome another pedigree tighthead prop			0
the set piece is largely reliable , but the breakdown work can be hit and miss – captain @entity40 is under pressure on that basis			0
@entity101 during june 's tour of @entity10 - the marauding centre is @entity0 's x-factor behind the scrum , there are many half - back options , but midfield and the back three are areas to resolve			1
prolific , consistent , reliable wings are in short supply and no 12 remains a conundrum			0
@entity0 wish to play a more expansive game , but they can not do so until they are settled and confident			1
@entity44 needs three wins in the autumn and , ideally , a @entity136 title to generate serious momentum , but his team will be combative and fear no - one at home			0
@entity142 prop @entity141 is a scrum menace @entity144 @entity99 ranking : 7 key man : @entity141 – master scrummager			2
@entity149 bemoans the abundance of foreigners in the top 14 league			0
but the head coach still has sufficient players of test quality to call upon , such as the magnificent @entity156 in the back row and a pair of sensational centres – @entity160 and @entity161			1
‘ @entity144 ’ have been abject in the @entity136 in recent years and they were a rabble in surrendering 3 - 0 to the @entity166 @entity165 in june , but – as ever – there is no knowing when they may suddenly ignite			0
history suggests they can emerge from their dire state to be a threat			0
@entity173 @entity99 ranking : 5 key man : @entity176 – attacking ring - master			2
@entity178 has been in charge for one season and his team marked it with a @entity136 triumph , to give the great @entity184 a fitting send - off			0
life after the iconic centre will be difficult – it is not just a matter of replacing the player but also filling the inspiration void			0
yet , @entity173 ’s first assignment without ‘ @entity193 ’ led to a 2 - 0 win in @entity195 , which is no mean feat. they must hope that their other veteran talisman has enough left in him to be a force at the @entity3			1
there are @entity201 in all areas , an improved scrum and ball - carrying clout , and @entity178 provides astute tactical nous			0
@entity173 fly - alf @entity176 ( right ) will be pulling the strings in a largely classy green machine line - up @entity210 @entity99 ranking : 8 key man : @entity213 – rare ‘ x-factor ’ back			2
@entity217 coach @entity216 has a huge task on his hands to make the @entity220 competitive at next year ’s tournament			1
in the last @entity136 , they scored just 47 points in their five games – highlighting a chronic lack of attacking menace			0
their 20 - 0 home defeat against @entity0 was the shocking nadir , but @entity216 led his side to summer wins over the @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity195 , before a weakened team were routed by the @entity235			1
not enough depth , especially in the backs , but positive results for @entity239 and @entity240 may provide renewed belief			0
samoa are a threat to their qualification from @entity245 @entity213 has the capacity to produce something special but his @entity210 lack depth under @entity216 @entity249 @entity99 ranking : 6 key man : @entity252 – groundhog captain			2
how they need a major southern - hemisphere scalp this autumn			1
@entity255 has turned his team into regular masters of this continent , but against the @entity260 giants they are in a prolonged losing rut			0
the @entity263 issue is a lack of belief – they had @entity235 by the throats in @entity268 in june , but conspired to lose the @entity269			0
doubts remain over best choice at 10 and @entity255 ca n’t afford many injuries due to lack of elite cover in some areas			2
veteran props may be in decline , but overall their best xv has ample bulk , pace , power and experience for tough pool a battles			0
@entity249 ' fearless leader @entity252 is dynamic at the breakdown but they need a scalp from the south @entity166 @entity99 ranking : 3 key man : @entity289 – main running threat			2
mixed signals are emerging about the strength of the @entity166 revival under @entity294			0
they managed to prevent a @entity217 world record for consecutive test wins by drawing with the world champions in @entity299 , only to promptly ship a half - century of points in @entity301 a week later			2
then they beat the @entity235 but laboured to dispatch @entity195			0
@entity289 is a lethal presence out wide , but their controversial stars are either peripheral – in the case of @entity307 and @entity308 – or overseas – in the case of @entity310			0
up front , they continue to lack set - piece clout and mighty flanker @entity313 is missed			0
@entity289 is a destructive runner but inconsistency is becoming the hallmark of @entity294 's @entity166 @entity10 @entity99 ranking : 1 key man : @entity320 - world ’s best player			1
@entity321 ’s @entity10 are imperious			1
their dominance of the world game goes on unchecked			0
@entity0 gave them a fright in june , without managing to end their long spell of home rule which now extends to 36 tests			1
they have lost just once since the last @entity3 and continue to thwart the chasing pack			1
despite doubts about veterans such as captain @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 , new sensations keep emerging			0
@entity336 is the try - scoring phenomenon who provides the finishing class to capitalise on clinical counter-attacking and unsurpassed skill levels			0
@entity10 have a gear no other side possesses			1
@entity10 's blindside flanker @entity320 stands among an @entity10 side in a class of their own @entity235 @entity99 ranking : 2 key man : @entity349 – rookie enforcer			1
seemingly the best equipped of the challengers to @entity10 supremacy , as they are armed with deep reserves of powerful players who believe they are the pre-eminent rugby nation			1
they have lowered the @entity10 flag at junior level of late and must hope the habit pervades the senior ranks soon			1
@entity349 i a young star for the @entity235 , who have the weapons to trouble the @entity10 on their day , the @entity235 generate forward fury which no country can handle – as @entity0 found out in @entity367 two years ago , while @entity368 is a gloriously unorthodox attacking presence			1
what they need now is conviction from coach @entity372 about the best strategic approach			2
muddled thinking is hampering the @entity235 .			0

a year from thursday , @entity0 face @entity1 in the @entity3 opener
defending champions @entity10 remain the benchmark
southern hemisphere teams are still the dominant force
@entity0 head coach @entity20 says motivation is the key
