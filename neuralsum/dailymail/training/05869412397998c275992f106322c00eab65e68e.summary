by @entity0 published : 09:48 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 12:54 est , 4 november 2013 what started off as an innocent student tradition where upperclassmen men would present freshman women with a red rose and peck on the cheek at midnight has turned into something more debauched and , in some ways , dangerous			1
@entity9 on the @entity10 is a @entity12 tradition started in the late 1800s that went out of style for many years before being resurrected in the 1980s with the addition of binge drinking			1
on the first full moon on the school year , students get drunk and many dress up in costume or body paint to lock lips with as many people from midnight to 1am			1
this year it was held on october 22 instead of the full moon because of a conflict with homecoming			1
welcome to college : on the first full moon of the school year , students at @entity12 participate in a 120 - year - old tradition where freshman make out with upperclassmen on the quad ' if you are single and want to make out with people , you just go up and kiss them , ' senior @entity41 told @entity42			1
' usually they are people you know or know of - rarely a stranger			2
a lot of people are pretty tipsy and have a really good time			0
' modern additions to this ' orgy of interclass kissing ' ( as it 's been described in the @entity55 ) include a same - sex area and a bingo game where different kinds of students make up the different boxes : a pair of twins , a red head , someone who got a 2,400 on the @entity65 the goal of the game is to get five in a row or all of the boxes for a blackout			1
the middle box is always the @entity12 mascot - the tree			2
this year 's mascot , @entity74 , estimated that he kissed 566 people - a new record			1
' never kiss the tree , ' alumna @entity77 warned in the @entity55			0
' he 's like @entity80			2
' the number one issue for administrators is that the tradition occurs during flu season and that the mass exchange of saliva could spark an outbreak			1
every year they attempt to educate the students on proper safety measures to ward off the cold or something worse like meningitis			2
' we tell them , " do n't floss beforehand , do n't brush , do n't do anything that could create microabrasions in your gums for germs to get in			0
" ' said @entity101 , an educator who graduated in 2011			0
' and we have tables where we offer mints and little dixie cups of mouthwash			0
' modern spin : @entity9 on the @entity10 has become much more debauched since being revamped in the late 1980s			1
this year 's event happened on october 22 due to a conflict with homecoming			1
students kissed outside the school 's old student union building , right but for dr @entity114 , professor and chair of preventative medicine at @entity117 , the real problem is not the spread of disease			1
' the emphasis on permission and mutual consent is absolutely critical			0
the actual health hazard is probably very , very small and would be difficult to measure , ' dr @entity114 said			0
' certainly if we have impaired males , who tend to get more aggressive , and females tend to get more submissive or accommodating , that 's where the issues come up with the drinking and morning after regrets			0
' the school has only cancelled the event once - in 2009 when many @entity136 schools were dealing with an outbreak of swine flu			2
the tradition continued on an unofficial basis			0
@entity141 was a freshman that year and attended the event			2
she says she 's gotten strep throat twice from participating			0
' the repercussions were brutal , and i wish i had done better on the @entity146 final i took later			0
but i think in the long run , getting to tell people i 've kissed over 50 - plus people in a night is worth it , ' she said .			0

@entity9 on the @entity10 started in the late 1800s when upperclassmen men would present freshman women with a red rose and peck on the cheek
the tradition went out of style but was resurrected in the 1980s *reflecting* modern sexual mores
today 's tradition occurs on the first full moon of every school year when students *gather* to drunkenly make - out with each other for an hour
the school *sanctions* the event to control it and try to prevent the spread of disease
