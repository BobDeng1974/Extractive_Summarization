by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has set himself the ' small ' goals of becoming @entity5 's most successful player in the modern era and completing a career @entity8 following his thrilling triumph in the @entity10 on sunday			1
@entity2 claimed his second major in the space of four weeks and fourth of his career at @entity14 , becoming the first player to win back - to - back titles since @entity17 also did the @entity19 and @entity20 @entity10 double in 2008			1
the 25 - year - old is the third youngest player , behind @entity23 and @entity24 , to win four majors and will travel to @entity26 next april seeking to join @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity23 and @entity24 as the only men to have won all four majors			1
@entity23 is the only player to have achieved that feat by winning the @entity19 , @entity99 and @entity20 @entity10 in 2000 and the masters in 2001			1
' when i won the @entity66 i said that there would be a lot of hype going into @entity26 , which there obviously will be , ' said @entity2 , who admitted winning ' ugly ' was more satisfying than his previous more emphatic major victories			2
' and if i was somehow to win there , it would obviously be a lot of hype going into the @entity19			1
' we 'll take it one step at a time			0
we ca n't get ahead of ourselves here			0
i 'm playing some great golf at the minute and i want to keep this run going as long as i can , and hopefully i 'm in just as good form heading into @entity26 next year and have a chance to win the career @entity8			2
' if that happens , then we 'll turn our attention to @entity97 and i 'll try and get the job done there			0
' i said i thought winning the @entity66 a few weeks ago had sort of put me on a higher level in this game			0
but then to win a fourth major here , to be one behind @entity0 ( @entity126 ) , one behind @entity127 ( @entity128 ) , level with @entity130 ( @entity131 ) , level with @entity133 ...			2
i never thought i 'd get this far at 25 years of age			0
' it 's something that i 'm just going to have to come to terms with			0
i was happy being a two - time major champion coming into this year and all of a sudden i 'm a four - time major champion and going for the career @entity8 at @entity26 in 242 days - not that i 'm counting ! ' even before sunday 's one - shot over @entity126 , which was completed in near - darkness after a lengthy rain delay , there had been talk of @entity23 ' era being over and @entity2 's just beginning			1
but the world number one knows he has a long way to go before getting near the 14 majors won by @entity149 and the record of 18 held by @entity24			1
where 's it gone : @entity2 scampers to find the location of his ball after a bunker shot written in the stars : the @entity79 made birdie at that 17th hole @entity43 - day 2 highlights ' i think i 've got to take it one small step at a time , ' added @entity2 , who will parade the @entity65 - and possibly the @entity10 - at @entity164 ahead of @entity166 's game with @entity167 on saturday			1
' i think the two next realistic goals are the career @entity8 and trying to become the most successful @entity171 player ever in the modern era			0
' and hopefully , when i achieve those , i can start to think about other things			0
' whether it was intentional or not , it was noticeable that @entity2 said ' when ' rather than ' if ' in that sentence			2
a year after labelling his own play ' brain dead ' after missing the cut in the @entity19 and struggling with his new equipment , @entity2 is riding the crest of a wave that shows no sign of slowing down			1
' i 've got that sense of belief in myself now that i go into every tournament i play knowing that i can win , ' added @entity2 , who won his first @entity191 event at the @entity192 between his major triumphs			1
' it 's a great feeling to have			0
' i think i 've always had that sense but after this run of golf , it 's confirmed that i can turn up at any tournament anywhere in the world and know that if i play my game , i can walk away with a trophy			0
' out of character : things did n't start the way @entity2 had hoped on sunday			2

@entity94 is in the form of his life
@entity2 sits on top of the world after @entity19 and @entity20 @entity10 double
third youngest player ever to win four majors after @entity23 and @entity24
