@entity1 ’s shock axing of @entity2 allows the network to introduce @entity4 as their new lead football presenter ahead of a fiercely fought tv auction for @entity7 highlights			1
@entity8 will bid strongly against @entity10 ’s @entity9 for tv rights to be awarded in around a week ’s time and the commercial channel wanted to complete their reshuffle of on - screen football talent before then			0
it is expected that the price of the highlights package , for which the @entity10 paid £ 183million for their current three - year deal , could rise to as much as £ 300m and @entity1 have the deeper pockets			1
@entity2 , who has been replaced as @entity1 's lead football host , pictured in west @entity22 on friday @entity2 appeared in good spirits despite the news , as he walked near his home in west @entity22 this season @entity1 - @entity28 internationals , @entity29 , @entity30 @entity31 - @entity7 , @entity29 , other home nations internationals @entity10 - @entity7 highlights , @entity34 @entity35 - @entity7 , @entity34 , @entity30 2015 - 16 season @entity1 - @entity28 international games , @entity29 and @entity30 highlights @entity31 - @entity7 , other home nations internationals @entity10 - @entity7 highlights , @entity34 @entity35 - @entity7 , @entity34 , @entity29 , @entity30 but this is one flagship contract that the @entity10 — faced with losing golf ’s @entity41 to @entity31 — are desperate to keep more than any other apart from @entity43			1
unpopular with viewers , @entity2 was the subject of a @entity47 campaign — attracting more than 37,000 ‘ likes ’ — to have him removed from hosting @entity1 football after the last @entity50			1
he was told this week his contract was being terminated			0
@entity2 signed a £ 500,000 one - year renewal last april that expires at the end of the season			1
at the time he took a whopping £ 1m salary cut because the extension just covered his dwindling football presenting duties			0
he joined @entity1 from the @entity10 on a £ 6m four - year contract in 2010 which included hosting breakfast show @entity60			1
since the demise of that programme and @entity1 losing live rights to the @entity34 , @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity2 was increasingly seen as a luxury who did little for the ratings			1
the 47 - year - old @entity68 was trying to negotiate new terms when @entity1 started their football revamp by announcing earlier this month that second - choice presenter @entity72 ’s contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and pundit @entity74 would be leaving by mutual consent			1
@entity2 has been replaced by @entity4 as @entity1 's lead football host with immediate effect @entity2 and pundits @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 ( @entity82 ) get soaked by a spinkler in @entity84 @entity2 ( left ) has been replaced by @entity4 ( right ) , pictured working for @entity85 former @entity87 midfielder @entity86 ( centre ) left @entity1 prior to last summer 's @entity50 in @entity89 @entity2 presented @entity1 's @entity29 coverage but the channel will not show live games next season instead of a new agreement , @entity2 has been shown the door			1
he leaves immediately with @entity1 ’s unusual ‘ no comment ’ about anything to do with his exit suggesting there is a legal fight brewing over the size of his pay - off			0
@entity4 will be in the hot seat for @entity1 ’s next live match on february 17 , the first leg of @entity106 ’s @entity29 tie with @entity107 but will continue to work for @entity85			1
he will reduce his football involvement on @entity85 to avoid conflict with his @entity1 role			0
highly regarded at the @entity10 , @entity4 would not have moved if not for the potential promise of a lot more football work than @entity29 highlights and @entity28 matches after this season — if @entity1 win rights to @entity7 highlights @entity4 ( left ) , pictured presenting boxing for @entity117 , will take over from @entity2 immediately @entity2 sports shorts and flip flops while presenting @entity1 's live @entity50 coverage in @entity89 last summer @entity2 speaks with @entity122 boss @entity121 before the @entity34 final at @entity124 last year pundit and co-commentator @entity74 ( right ) left @entity1 by mutual consent earlier this month @entity2 ’s departure brought a hugely positive reaction on social media			1
so it is ironic that it was @entity2 who won the presenter shootout against @entity4 when the @entity10 launched their sunday @entity7 highlights show , @entity134 in 2004			1
@entity4 was strong favourite before a late change of mind by the @entity10 executive who felt @entity2 ’s @entity68 vowels would go down better than @entity4 ’s public school accent honed at @entity141			2
eleven years on it is posh ‘ @entity143 ’ who finally has the upper hand			0
@entity4 said : ‘ i am delighted to be given this great opportunity			0
i ’m looking forward to working with @entity1 ’s talented pool of commentators and pundits			0
