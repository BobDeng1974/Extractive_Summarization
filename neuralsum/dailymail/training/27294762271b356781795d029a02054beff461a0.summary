by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 to hell with moral victories , heroic near - misses and statistical consolations			2
@entity6 confront the @entity7 again with twin targets — victory and history			1
a week on from an agonising @entity14 demise , @entity6 find themselves at a seminal moment in their crusade to re-emerge as a global force			1
they are no longer hampered by fixture congestion , or the absence of several injured men			0
they are no longer afflicted by the age - old @entity25 curse of being beaten before they start in these parts			0
the crunch : @entity29 and @entity30 collide in training ahead of the @entity32 the box kick @entity34 is ready to unleash a line - up as potent as any under his regime and his side are utterly bereft of fear in the face of the world champions			1
there were no excuses last saturday following the 20 - 15 defeat at @entity45 , but the backdrop of disruption meant that a defeat was widely acclaimed as a triumph of sorts			1
asked if another heroic defeat would suffice , flanker @entity51 said : ‘ no. while we were proud of the effort and performance last week , we will never accept losing , regardless of the opposition			2
we go into every game intending and fully expecting to win			0
’ considering the doomsday scenario of another shattering loss , he added : ‘ it will be difficult and the pressure will begin to mount			0
we certainly did n’t come here to lose any games , never mind two on the bounce and be staring down the barrel of three losses			0
it certainly focuses the mind			0
we ’ll concentrate on levelling the score			0
’ @entity6 know that what matters in this crucial second test is finishing ahead on the scoreboard , whatever it takes			1
the big push : @entity6 will be desperate to level the series against @entity7 the cross-field kick there is a bigger picture , the need to build a game - plan capable of delivering @entity82 glory , but the priority for now is managing to claim rugby ’s most prized scalp in hostile territory			1
success would be a giant stride forward			0
five times @entity6 have played the @entity7 on @entity7 ’s @entity90 and five times they have lost — in 1963 , 1985 , 1998 , 2004 and 2008			1
twice this city has staged this fixture and the visitors have conceded a century of points , scoring a paltry 25 in response			0
@entity6 have a 100 per cent record at the @entity98 , but their opponents there — at the last @entity82 — were @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
@entity25 ambition has too often amounted to merely seeking respectability in the face of @entity107 supremacy , but that inferiority complex has been shattered			0
@entity34 ’s side do not bend the knee at the first sign of those fabled shirts			1
three times they have played these opponents since @entity116 took over in 2012 and the current aggregate score is 75 - 71 in @entity6 ’s favour			1
in the aftermath of the opening skirmish in @entity14 , there has been ample focus on various areas of @entity25 dominance : scrum and line - out , territory , possession — the old staples — along with line - breaks , metres made , defenders beaten and so on			1
in a nutshell , they played well but lost			0
it ca n’t happen again if their advance is to continue apace			0
the @entity7 are coming into this test with contrasting priorities			1
they had the result last weekend , but fell a long way below the standards they have come to expect in winning all but one test since claiming the home @entity82 in 2011			1
heartbreak : @entity146 scores the deciding try as unfancied @entity6 fell to gallant defeat in @entity14 the counter attack @entity150 , the hosts ’ head coach , anticipates a reaction from his players			2
‘ we should n’t lose sight of the fact we did win the @entity144 , but at the same time we were n’t proud of our performance , ’ he said			0
‘ this sets up brilliantly the second instalment of what could be a rivalry that endures all the way to next year ’s @entity82 final			2
’ @entity6 must hope their contingent of @entity166 finalists swiftly reintegrate to guard against the threat of a damaging loss of cohesion			2
theoretically , they will be improved by @entity171 ’s spark at scrum - half and the combative authority of @entity174 at @entity175 , while the glass - half - full vision involves @entity177 and @entity178 creating a platform to unleash the redeployed @entity180 out wide or on in - field forays			2
up front , @entity182 , @entity183 will need to make a collective effort to smash @entity186 out of his poaching routine at the rucks			0
if they do so , @entity189 blasts forward with the same ball - carrying clout he did last week and the @entity194 - @entity193 axis delivers another line - out masterclass , @entity6 will have a chance			1
more so if their defensive line - speed hurries the @entity197 into another torrent of errors			1
gutted : @entity201 and @entity29 look dejected following a defeat that was hard to swallow it may come down to the impact of the replacements , which is when @entity34 will relish being able to send on the likes of @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			2
having such pedigree and firepower to add second - half impetus could swing the contest @entity6 ’s way			2
the majority of those in attendance under the stadium roof will expect the perfect conditions and the jolt to the system delivered seven days earlier to ensure a night of @entity221 and the resumption of normal service			0
but maybe , just maybe , they will be condemned to watching @entity116 ’s rising side seize their victory and history .			0

@entity6 are at a seminal moment in their crusade to re-emerge as a global force after last week **'s** stinging 20 - 15 defeat to @entity7
@entity34 is ready to unleash a line - up as potent as any under his regime and his side are utterly bereft of fear
@entity6 know that what matters in this crucial second test is finishing ahead on the scoreboard , whatever it takes
there is a bigger picture , the need to build a game - plan capable of delivering @entity82 glory , but the priority for now is managing to claim rugby **'s** most prized scalp in hostile territory
