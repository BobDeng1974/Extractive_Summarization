clutching a bunch of flowers , this little boy cuts a rather forlorn figure as he watches the @entity4 get into her car			2
the reason ? he was one of dozens of children left disappointed when the @entity4 broke with tradition by not accepting flowers in @entity11 yesterday			1
more than 1,000 people , many of whom had travelled long distances , gathered outside @entity16 to cheer the @entity4 as she arrived for the morning service			2
do n't go ! a little boy watches the @entity4 get into her @entity19 yesterday , as he clutches a bouquet he had hoped to give her maybe next time : the little boy is comforted by his mother after the @entity4 broke with tradition by not stopping for the flowers elegant : the @entity4 wore a vivid shade of purple as she arrived at church this morning looking good : the @entity4 completed her all - purple ensemble with a @entity32 bag she usually accepts flowers from children every sunday morning during her @entity36 break in @entity37			1
but yesterday she paused only to wave to wellwishers as she emerged after the service ended at 11.45am			1
the queen was then driven straight back to @entity11 in her maroon @entity19			0
one parent , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ we drove more than 50 miles with our five - year - old daughter so she could present a small bouquet to the @entity4			2
' she had practised how to curtsey and it would have been a big moment for her so it was very disappointing to be told that the @entity4 was not receiving any flowers			2
‘ this policeman just told us that it was not happening today because the @entity4 was late for her family lunch on christmas day due to so many children giving her flowers			1
’ well - wrapped : the queen was tucked beneath a blue wool blanket as she was driven to the service @entity56 : the monarch chattde with well - wishers as she makes her way into @entity61 church family affair : the @entity63 and sir @entity64 ( left ) , and the @entity65 and @entity66 ( right ) she 's arrived ! princess @entity67 smiles as the @entity4 's car arrives while a policeman offers a respectful salute another onlooker said : ' i have been coming to church services at @entity11 for 20 years and this is the first time that i can remember that the @entity4 has not accepted flowers			1
' normally children are allowed under a rope outside the 13th century church and line up by the steps so that they can file past the @entity4 and hand her their bouquets			1
the @entity4 then usually gives the flowers to a policewoman who puts them in the back of her car			2
on christmas day , an estimated 5,000 members of the public watched the royals at @entity11 , with children queuing up to present posies to the @entity4			2
so overwhelmed were the royals by the numbers , that the @entity93 had to lend a hand and collected flowers from a second line			0
it is thought that more than 100 children wanted to give flowers to the @entity4 on christmas day			2
yesterday princess @entity67 , who was also at the church , accepted some bouquets on her mother ’s behalf			1
last night , officials dismissed the suggestion that the @entity4 was rushing for lunch			0
it is understood she does not usually eat until later in the day			0
@entity108 and hearty : the @entity109 appeared to have enjoyed his walk to church with the princess royal @entity56 : the @entity109 appeared to be in good spirits as he arrived on foot for the service chic : @entity65 offered royal fashion fans a treat courtesy of an elegant navy blue coat and fedora collection : princess @entity67 accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children instead of the queen a palace spokesman said : ‘ her majesty is always grateful whenever people wish to present flowers and she accepted many flowers on christmas day			1
‘ however , she does not accept them in person on every occasion			0
’ accompanying her majesty at the ceremony were senior royals , among them prince @entity137 , the princess royal and the @entity109 , as well as the @entity139 and @entity65			1
the @entity109 and @entity67 , dressed in a striking crimson ensemble , led the way from the main house on foot , with prince @entity137 and @entity144 walking behind			1
also appearing at the village church was the @entity139 and @entity65 ' daughter , @entity66 , who wore the same green velvet - collared coat for the third year in a row , but @entity150 , prince @entity151 and @entity152 and @entity153 were nowhere to be seen			1
it is believed that the @entity155 also left @entity11 after christmas day to spend time with her family			0
instead , fashion fans had to content themselves with the sight of @entity65 , elegant in a navy coat and matching trilby , and the monarch herself who wowed the crowd in a suitably regal purple coat and hat			1
during the service , which was led by the @entity170 , the @entity171 , prayers were said for people living in @entity173 , those serving in @entity174 and the family of captain @entity176 , the @entity167 killed in action two days before @entity36			0
the congregation also prayed for those who suffered the effects of flooding and severe weather over the festive period			0
she 's just arrived at the age where little girls begin to choose their own clothes but it seems that @entity66 , 10 , is happier with old favourites			0
the @entity4 's youngest granddaughter appeared at church in @entity11 this morning in a green tweed coat first worn to a @entity36 service two years ago			0
since then , the garment has been on outings to @entity195 and to this year 's @entity197 service at @entity198 in @entity199 , as well as at subsequent festive services at @entity11			0
clearly , the young @entity66 resembles her famously thrifty grandmother in more ways than one			0
old favourite : @entity66 in the green coat in 2012 at @entity195 and earlier this year at @entity199			0

the monarch usually accepts flowers from waiting children
many parents and families had come a long way to catch sight of her
but yesterday as she emerged from church she only paused to wave
@entity109 , @entity67 and the @entity63 also attended
they were *joined* by the @entity139 and @entity65 and their daughter
