collapsed roofs , mangled cages and sunken floors - these are the eerie pictures taken inside an abandoned psychiatric hospital where patients were once locked up and given lobotomies			1
the abandoned site in north @entity9 , known as @entity10 , has been partially devastated by fire while there are still cages intact that were used to prevent patients escaping from their designated areas			1
more than 20 patients were selected for prefrontal lobotomy treatments between 1942 and 1944 at the hospital , with one patient dying from the controversial procedure			1
@entity21 , which consisted of the removal of parts of the brain , began to be routinely carried out in the 1930s as a supposed treatment for those considered insane - but the barbaric practice was stopped two decades later with the introduction of antipsychotic medicines			2
the once eloquent and imposing building was built in 1848 and designed by architect @entity32			2
it was designated for closure by mp @entity35 in 1960 and was finally shut for good in 1995			2
photographer @entity36 described the scene : ' it was by far the creepiest place i have ever been into			1
there were so many strange noises emanating from the buildings that i really did n't want to wander too far from my companion			0
' at one point we both heard what sounded like a groan and just stopped and stared at each other			2
i do n't believe in ghosts but i did n't want to hang around			0
' the site has been subject to a compulsory purchase order by @entity52 council			0
but that is being appealed by the site 's current owners			0
the front facade is @entity57 listed and a proposal to build homes around the entrance has been put forward			0
however , the restoration cost is set to be close to a million pounds			0
mr @entity36 added : ' it was in a really poor state			1
it looked as thought a bomb had tore through the site , everything was damaged			0
there was nothing to stop you entering the site and as a result the vandalism and fire damage was plain to see			0
' i wonder how far a million pounds would go to restoring the hospital			2
seems as though it would make more sense to flatten the site and start over			0
