millions of @entity0 , including academics , activists and celebrities , have warned @entity5 families not to be drawn into a ‘ @entity7 ’ experiment			2
a coalition of 57 million people have signed an open letter to @entity5 consumers highlighting potential harm to human health and the environment caused by genetically modified crops			1
signatories include health , consumer and farming groups as well as @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
the @entity24 delegation lef tto right : @entity26 , @entity27 , fashion designer @entity28 , chef @entity29 , @entity0 campaigners @entity30 and @entity32 with @entity33 mp the campaign is designed to counter the @entity36 campaign that has been mounted by the government and the biotech industry , which is intended to open up @entity5 to @entity27 crops and food			1
the @entity0 government and the @entity42 are negotiating a free trade treaty – known as @entity44 – which would increase the flow of @entity0 @entity27 food into @entity5 and @entity47			1
already , more @entity0 foods containing @entity27 ingredients are being found in @entity5 stores , despite the fact that most have pledged not to use them in own - label products			1
the @entity54 revealed over the weekend how @entity55 is selling six imported foods , including cookies and sauces , containing @entity27 others are selling big brand @entity0 products , such as @entity62 and some oreo lines , containing @entity27 separately , the government has been pressing the @entity65 to allow @entity5 to grow @entity27 crops even if other nations chose to ban them			1
this could allow commercial planting to in six to 18 months			0
the letter was delivered to @entity24 yesterday by a delegation including campaigners , the designer @entity28 , the chef @entity75 and former @entity77 environment secretary , @entity33			1
actors @entity20 ( pictured left ) and @entity80 ( right ) are among the 57 million people who have signed the letter it argues that health concerns remain over the safety of @entity27 crops , most of which are grown in partnership with the powerful weedkiller glyphosate , also known as @entity90			1
some animal studies have linked @entity27 and glyphosate to damage to the liver and kidneys , reproductive abnormalities , and even tumours			2
these findings have been rejected by the industry and the @entity99			0
@entity27 ingredients are now in 70 per cent of processed foods in the @entity0			2
critics point out that traces of glyphosate have been found in drinking water and the breast milk and urine of @entity0 mothers			0
levels in the breast milk were claimed to be around 1,600 times higher than is currently allowed in @entity47 drinking water			0
the letter argues that @entity27 crops have never delivered on promises to increase yields and profits or to decrease pesticide use			1
pesticide use can be 24 per cent higher amongst @entity27 farmers , which has harmed insects and bees			2
the population of the monarch butterfly , for example , has dropped by over 80 per cent in some parts of the @entity0			0
this is because @entity90 kills milkweed , which is the @entity123 ’s key food source			0
there is also evidence that weeds have evolved to become immune to glyphosate , making them difficult and expensive to remove			0
@entity132 , research professor at the @entity134 , said : ‘ we have superweeds , and farmers are suffering			0
the public health cost is unknowable , not least because scientists themselves are afraid to criticise the industry			0
‘ @entity141 too little is known about about @entity142 , and what little we 've been able to glean demonstrates it has little to offer , beyond profits for chemical companies			0
’ @entity20 said : ‘ instead of bringing certainty and security , @entity27 organisms have raised more and more worrying questions about their effectiveness , their necessity , and even their safety			1
polls show that the majority of @entity0 citizens – and in fact citizens everywhere – either want them labelled or taken out of the food system altogether			0
’ the delegation pictured at @entity24 yesterday , handing over an open letter from 57 million @entity0 warning @entity5 people of the dangers of @entity27 food and farming actor @entity80 said : ‘ i believe the biotech companies who produce the seeds and herbicides have not proved the safety of their food production methods , and are concerned in cornering the food market while showing no concern for the long term effects of their production methods			1
‘ they are immensely wealthy and influential , and i believe we must stand up to the enormous pressure they are putting on governments and farmers in the @entity5 and around the world to commercialise the growing of seeds			2
’ @entity26 , the campaign director for @entity5 group , @entity27 , said : ‘ the @entity0 experience of @entity27 shines a light on how our own food future will unfold if we continue to race pell - mell down the road to a genetically modified @entity5			1
‘ it ’s time the public was brought back into the debate about what they eat , and what they feed their children , and it ’s time politicians and regulators started listening			0
’ the biotech industry said @entity27 crops and food have been proven safe , while offering benefits to farmers			1
dr @entity206 , chairman of the industry ’s @entity207 , said : ‘ the plant biotechnology industry takes product safety regarding biotech food and feed very seriously and is committed to the highest standards of testing for its products			0
’ he said a @entity42 report published in 2011 , which looked at 130 research projects , concluded ‘ there is , as of today , no scientific evidence associating gmos with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms			0
' he added : ‘ an estimated three trillion meals containing @entity27 ingredients have been eaten around the world over the last 17 years without a single substantiated case of ill - health			2
‘ @entity231 has said that : ‘ no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods			2
