by @entity1 reporter published : 07:59 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 24 july 2012 a defiant grandmother staged a three - day sit - in at her son ’s stately home to stop bailiffs repossessing it			1
@entity8 , 78 , went without food or sleep for hour after hour in the library of the £ 2million property			1
as a team of security guards took it in shifts to watch her – ready to lock up the house if she ventured outdoors – mrs @entity8 remained ensconced in her armchair at @entity19 , near @entity20 , @entity21			1
feisty : mrs @entity8 was part of her son 's property company in the 1990s , but retired five years ago @entity19 owner @entity26 bought the huge @entity21 pile for £ 1.94m , but has been threatened with repossession after running into money trouble and finally her resistance paid off when the bailiffs were withdrawn , giving her son @entity32 more time to negotiate with @entity34 - owned @entity33			1
mr @entity26 , 48 , a former estate agent , bought the 17 - bedroom house for £ 1.94million in 2004			1
he then spent £ 800,000 restoring it as an upmarket wedding venue			2
but its future was placed in doubt when his property firm ran into financial difficulties			2
the stand - off took place after representatives of the bank turned up unannounced to seek possession of the property			1
sit - in : mrs @entity8 , 78 , said she would not move from the house until the @entity34 bank proved they had the legal right to repossession mr @entity26 was not at home so his mother , a grandmother of four who lives in a converted stable block on the estate , stepped in			1
she said : ‘ i was told that they were down at the house and my son was not here , so i came down to see what they were doing			2
‘ they could not show me paperwork showing they had the right to take possession so i told them that they had no right to be here			0
‘ when they said , “ well , no one is living here ” , i said , “ i can if you want ”			0
’ mrs @entity8 , who has osteoporosis and suffered a stroke in 2006 , took up her position in an armchair in the library by a window overlooking the estate so she ‘ could see who was coming and going ’ while a young carer remained by her side			2
surprised by her resistance , the bank called in a team of seven security guards to take it in turns to watch the property , prepared to seize it if mrs @entity8 left			1
she claimed that at one point during the sit - in she called the police when security guards blocked the door to the bathroom in an attempt to force her out of the mansion			1
‘ they were quite intimidating , but i stayed put			0
‘ one man was very irritating			0
he thought he could move me by talking to me , but of course he could n’t			0
’ divorcee mrs @entity8 , a former bookkeeper who moved to @entity21 when she was evacuated from @entity105 as a child during @entity107 , said she was determined not to back down and let the bank take the home her son had worked hard to restore			1
‘ it was very uncomfortable , ’ she said			0
‘ i hardly ate a thing because i was very upset and anxious for them to go and i did n’t sleep a lot , but i ’m a strong character			0
‘ it took a lot of hard work to restore this house , it was so dilapidated			0
my son had a dream for a long time to put a stately home back together again			1
it is beautiful – i was not going to let it go			0
’ security men from @entity34 firm @entity33 attempted to repossess the 300 - year - old stately home last week she added : ‘ i can not keep very active as i have had a stroke which affects my walking , but i do n’t sit in a chair all day			1
‘ i walk about as best as i can and do housework , cleaning , cooking			0
anything i can do , i do it			0
’ mrs @entity8 said she is fond of the house , but that her eight years on the estate was marred by an incident in 2009 when it turned out that a masked ball at the house had been arranged by a swingers ’ group and degenerated into an orgy			2
her son , whose property company has gone into administration with debts totalling £ 11million , hopes to work with @entity33 to find a way to secure the future of the property			2
he is also in dispute with the bank over a five - bedroom mansion in @entity154 , @entity155 , which he has rented out to celebrities , including @entity158 and @entity159			2
he said : ‘ you try to keep financial difficulties from your mother but she has said no , she wants to be involved and she has found this quiet strength to absolutely take on my case			0
’ mr @entity26 added : ‘ we have some real difficulties but @entity167 is only closed temporarily			0

@entity8 , 78 , stages three - day sit - in against security firm
she refused to leave £ 2m stately home until @entity34 bank *provided* written evidence of legal right to take over property
