it might have looked like the most flagrant case of tapping - up since @entity3 met @entity4 in @entity6 ’s @entity5 in 2005 but it seems @entity8 ’s sunday evening meeting with his former @entity10 boss was simply the ultimate ‘ @entity11 ’			1
@entity8 has become increasingly exasperated by his situation at @entity10 and just 24 hours after another afternoon sitting on the sidelines in his new capacity as @entity16 ’s fourth - choice centre back ; who better to seek out for advice than @entity19			1
the @entity22 boss was in the @entity24 capital to cast his vote in the unofficial referendum on independence at the weekend and the two met and embraced in a quiet residential street close to @entity19 ’s @entity10 home , the image was captured by a passing fan and soon spread throughout social media			1
@entity8 ( left ) shares a joke with @entity34 on the bench during @entity10 's game against @entity37 in @entity8 ’s favour , most @entity10 supporters – even those that feel his form has slipped considerably since the heady days of 2009 - 2012 – feel that @entity16 is picking on his defender without justification			1
@entity10 ’s lack - lustre midfield is crying out for @entity44 to take up the conductor ’s baton			0
that move would free - up a space in the centre of defence for @entity8 to return to the first team for the first time since the @entity53			0
@entity16 has denied he has anything personal against @entity8			0
however , the images of him warming up on saturday against @entity56 only to sit back down again almost immediately as the coach made the decision to bring on @entity59 only added to the impression that all is not well between the two			0
@entity22 coach @entity19 ( right ) talks to @entity62 during his side 's clash with @entity65 last week @entity19 gets launched in the air after his @entity10 side claimed the @entity69 trophy in 2009 and if you ca n’t talk to the current coach then talk to the old one , the most - decorated in the club ’s history			1
@entity8 blossomed under @entity19 who encouraged his coming out with the ball from the back which was a feature of @entity10 ’s best football and has been seen less and less in recent seasons as the gap between the @entity10 defence and the rest of the team has got slowly wider			2
@entity8 will start @entity85 ’s @entity84 qualifier against @entity86 on saturday and then against @entity87 in @entity88 next week and the suggestion is that @entity16 is then preparing to give his centre - back a clean slate when he returns playing him in the run - up to the winter break			2
if the reunification between the two fails then january will bring plenty of suitors to @entity8 ’s door			0
although the club is banned from signing players , it still seems unlikely that @entity10 would sell @entity8 in january knowing that they are prohibited from bringing in a replacement .			0
