by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 captain @entity2			1
perhaps captain of @entity6 by next month if all goes smoothly at @entity7			1
is this a graduation season for @entity9 ? at the age of 28 , can he finally be trusted ? or can anybody do it ? after all , the only official duty on the pitch is the coin toss			1
off the pitch , maybe some programme notes and a column in the local paper			2
you lead out the team and might get to lift the trophy , but otherwise does captaincy in football really matter ? there is limited tactical scope , unlike in cricket or rugby and , as sir @entity30 is quick to note , the idea that virtually anyone can pull on the armband is enhanced when it is aimlessly slung around after a substitution			1
‘ he does n’t have to be your chief sneak , but you need your captain there , delivering your message and letting you know if something is brewing , ’ said sir @entity30			1
‘ we ’ve all seen teams implode and we hear about managers who lose the dressing room			2
‘ i set great store by it and i think @entity78 might be the same			1
he will have made this decision with great care			2
you want your captain to be in line with you and you have to trust him			1
it is not just about 90 minutes of football , but on the pitch too there will be times when you need your captain			1
’ history ’s finest captains are usually those associated with success			2
in @entity92 football they range from @entity36 and @entity93 to @entity94 and @entity95 , who was voted the @entity97 ’s greatest captain in a poll last year			2
is he in the team on merit ? clear and simple			0
the most important factor in any sport			0
is he at one with the coach ? will he be your eyes and ears ? can he make sure the dressing room is n’t lost ? you do n’t have to be best mates			0
does he have the respect of his team - mates on and off the pitch ? this is not about baggage from the past but what is happening currently			2
can he react in the heat of battle ? can he work with the referee ? can he go eye - to - eye and have a word with a team - mate when necessary ? 5			2
there is an art to it and it is underestimated in football			0
in the know : sir @entity30 says the captain must deliver the coach 's message on the pitch when needed expectation : @entity36 is widely regard as one of the best @entity4 captain in modern times ‘ i ’ve never heard of a great captain who was n’t a great player in his own right , ’ said @entity95 ’s @entity143 team - mate @entity142			1
‘ you wo n’t get many better captains than @entity95 and that ’s because you wo n’t get many better players than @entity95			0
he ’d fight , he ’d scrap , he ’d create goals and he ’d score goals			0
‘ the great @entity143 team was committed to a man , but you always need the sort of dynamic qualities you got from a guy like @entity95			0
that ’s what i think of as proper leadership			0
’ the best players score key goals and solidify defences , but the best captains add something more , an indiscernible binding quality which infiltrates the crowd , most evident when they are missing			0
@entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 are in this category			0
when @entity169 was a young captain , @entity173 would encourage him to take advantage of his status ; to exert pressure on officials and influence the game			2
influence : @entity170 is a captain @entity9 should admire , as well as @entity171 and @entity169 leaders : @entity169 and @entity171 have lead @entity181 and @entity182 to @entity184 titles first of many ? @entity9 and @entity185 lift the @entity186 in @entity187 @entity188 was a ‘ visual captain ’ according to @entity189 , who also played at @entity190 under @entity191			1
‘ @entity191 was n’t that type , ’ he said			0
‘ he was softly spoken but on the pitch he came alive			0
there was steel in his play			0
’ the roar of the lion - hearted captain has faded amid technical advances at the top			1
there are more foreign players and coaches , for whom captaincy means something subtly different , and more backroom assistants			0
as a teenager on loan at @entity211 , @entity189 found his skipper @entity212 was the go - to man for anything from pay packets to accommodation complaints			1
mentor : @entity189 says former @entity190 captain @entity188 was a ' visual leader ' concentrate : struggling @entity6 cricket captain @entity217 has shown you must do your own job first pressure : @entity9 has been tasked with some sort of responsibility from a young age at @entity4 he need not sort out lodgings for @entity226 , but @entity9 must develop his leadership style while performing consistently			1
it is only a few weeks since his @entity6 place was up for discussion and he ’ll be at the mercy of his goal rate			0
‘ you must do your own job first as @entity217 has found out over the last nine months , ’ was @entity235 ’s instant reaction to the question : what makes a good captain ? beyond that , @entity235 cites man - management skills and an ability to understand what makes others tick			1
leading by example can be sticking your head where it hurts or soldiering through pain , or summoning a free - kick like @entity250 against @entity251 in 2001			2
@entity250 was n’t @entity4 captain but led his country well			1
in football , international captaincy is different , more occasional , more ambassadorial and @entity250 ’s mass appeal helped			0
at the @entity258 , there were six goalkeeper captains , lots of midfielders and half a dozen high - end strikers : @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268			2
can work : forwards @entity264 and @entity263 captained @entity269 and @entity270 at the @entity258 defensive issues : with @entity272 leaving , @entity9 must take responsibility all over the pitch issue : @entity78 must find a way to galvanize @entity265 and @entity9 's partnership in last season ’s @entity184 , 75 per cent of teams were captained by defenders , mostly centre halves , and the rest by midfielders			1
at club level , managers choose the voice of authority over the poster boy ; someone who understands his working principles and tactical demands — often a defensive player who is well - placed to read and organise the game ( and help to referee it )			1
if you can spot a problem and fix it without instruction , that helps , too			0
there has to be good reason , iconic status or a local bond — @entity303 , for example — for placing the armband in attack			0
pandering to precious stars or trying to reform rebels is seldom the best policy , as @entity310 has found with five captains in nine years since @entity191 left			0
@entity9 ’s appointment has a ring of diplomacy to it			1
@entity4 ’s defence is low on experience without @entity318 , @entity272 and @entity319 and @entity320 does not need to prove his loyalty to @entity322 , his captain for @entity323			1
short fuse : many will think @entity9 's temper and off - field temper will hamper his ability as captain second chance : but @entity235 has shown you can prove the doubters wrong ‘ one of the biggest issues is how to galvanise @entity9 and @entity322 , ’ said @entity189			1
‘ @entity322 is no problem			0
he knows the manager loves him			2
the player most ill - at - ease is @entity9			1
this is a show of faith			0
it will give him a lift			0
just what @entity9 needs at this stage of his career			1
’ plenty will suspect that with his short fuse and penchant for off - field controversy @entity9 is not one of football ’s natural leaders			1
‘ you can be pigeon - holed , ’ said @entity235 , who found his own attitude the matter of national debate when he became @entity6 captain			1
‘ people were asking why they were giving it to an angry youth , a selfish cricketer , ’ he said			0
‘ i remember sitting down with ( former @entity363 chairman ) @entity364 at @entity365 to explain how that was before i was @entity6 captain			2
i was the one going out to face @entity367 and @entity368 and had to prepare myself in the best way i saw fit			0
important role : @entity78 will place his full trust in @entity9 ‘ @entity9 might be the player he is because of his aggression and anger			1
you might not want him to be the good guy			0
‘ you certainly do n’t want him to be sent off , but you change when you ’re captain			2
you start thinking of others			0
’ @entity320 is backing @entity9 to adapt and for his contagious enthusiasm to win the day			1
it is a big call , one he needs to pay off if he is to swiftly end last season ’s rot			0
for the @entity381 , captain @entity2 matters .			2

@entity78 will trust @entity9 with responsibility at @entity4
many will doubt striker 's *credentials* as skipper
sir @entity30 says captain must pass on manager 's messages
@entity189 knows the impact of a skipper in the @entity184
@entity235 believes @entity9 can *flourish* despite bad - boy image
