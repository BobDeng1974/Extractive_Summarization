if glowing patient testi - monials are anything to go by , the @entity4 ‘ zapper ’ can work near - miracles			1
manufacturers promise the device , which emits microwaves , can instantly erase unsightly thread veins on the face and body			1
yet the stock treatment given in skin clinics for these troublesome blemishes is laser therapy			1
this is potentially uncomfortable , with weeks of bruising and scabbing commonly seen afterwards , and it often does n’t completely solve the problem			2
@entity4 , on the other hand , causes little more than a slight redness which fades after a few hours			1
vanishing act : a patient 's nose before treatment , left , where microwaves are targeted at the red veins in short bursts , and after treatment , right thanks largely to word - of - mouth , dr @entity29 , which offer the treatment , has seen more than 2,000 patients , a third of whom had other types of thread vein removal without success			1
it begs the question : if @entity4 works , why is n’t it offered by all doctors ? like so many medical discoveries , @entity4 was a happy side effect of a different investigation			1
in 1998 , consultant vascular surgeon dr @entity45 was pursuing a treatment for cellulite – testing the premise that stimulating the skin with microwaves might reduce the dimpling effect			1
it did n’t , but he noticed that small thread veins were vanishing from patients ’ legs			1
today , the treatment is offered at dr @entity57 in @entity59 and three other branches nationwide			1
yet aside from gaining a patent for his technology , dr @entity45 has carried out no trials or published any research			2
as a result , few medics seem to have even heard of it , let alone recommend it			0
thread veins – also known as spider veins ( the medical term is telangiectasia ) – are simply veins which are visible below the skin			1
there is a genetic link , so you may have a predisposition to them , and incidence increases with age , smoking and sun exposure			0
‘ people get incredibly distressed about these blemishes on their faces , ’ says dr @entity85 , medical director of dr @entity57			0
‘ men in particular feel that they look like alcoholics as they tend to develop chunky veins on their noses			1
but often they do n’t drink			0
’ no laughing matter : comedian @entity94 was famous for his red nose so just what is this treatment ? ‘ microwaves are simply high frequency radiowaves			1
these are emitted from the fine needle that constitutes the tip of the device , ’ explains dr @entity85			0
‘ the short , sharp bursts of heat – pulsing every 0.2 of a second – are directed at the wall of the offending vein			0
’ while the skin surface is n’t heated , these short bursts cause the protein within the wall to coagulate			0
‘ it ’s like heating up egg white , ’ says dr @entity85			0
‘ the protein becomes sticky and seals off the vein			0
as it is the blood giving the thread vein its red colour , once it can not flow through there , the redness vanishes			1
’ the needle is used to track the vein across the face every one or two millimetres			1
the feeling is that of a tiny pinprick and no anaesthetic is needed			0
over the next few days the body reabsorbs the redundant vein wall			2
and although there are no formal clinical trials , @entity129 , a @entity130 aesthetic doctor in @entity131 , conducted a successful 2004 study into the effects of thermocoagulation using a similar machine on telangiectasia on the leg with 50 patients			0
‘ we see hundreds of patients a year			0
i ’d say that all of them are very happy with their results , ’ says dr @entity85			0
‘ about 40 per cent come back for further treatment at some stage			2
we are n’t re-treating the same veins , but new ones which have accumulated over the years			2
’ in one per cent of patients , redness may take a few days to dissipate			0
but the videos on the clinic ’s website are extraordinary – as the minute tip of the instrument touches the veins they simply vanish			2
so what of the other options for thread veins ? most doctors recommend @entity160 ( @entity160 ) , a device that emits light waves to destroy red veins			1
treatment costs from £ 500 , and results could be described as modest			2
a large scale study into @entity160 for facial telangiectasia concluded that patients had a 30 per cent reduction in the veins ’ appearance			2
and @entity160 is limited in that it can only be used on fair skin			0
another option is pulsed dye laser			0
@entity175 , of @entity177 ’s @entity176 , says : ‘ with the modern pulsed dye laser , people tend not to have any bruising , although older models cause dark bruises , which can be unsightly and take over a week to settle			0
’ finally , sclerotherapy is the injection of a substance into thread veins , which causes damage to cell walls and causes the vessel to shrink over a few weeks			1
it is generally more appropriate for leg veins			2
‘ we find microsclerotherapy much more effective for treating legs but less so on the face , ’ says vascular surgeon dr @entity192			2
professor @entity196 at @entity59 ’s @entity197 , who was given a demonstration of @entity4 , adds : ‘ i would treat the whole face with @entity160 or pulsed dye laser and consider @entity4 for remaining veins			1
’ the problem is , say experts , without proper research the overall effectiveness of the microwave zapper is unknown			0
and so , those who have it are essentially guinea pigs			0
‘ we ’re aware of @entity4 , but i do n’t recommend it , ’ says dr @entity192			1
‘ they have to come up with real hard proof			0
’ @entity4 from £ 395 , drnewmansclinic.co.uk @entity213 from £ 200 , @entity160 from £ 500 , jscurr.com pulsed dye laser from £ 300 , @entity160 from £ 400 , drnicklowe.com			1

although it appears to work ' miracles ' , few doctors offer treatment
