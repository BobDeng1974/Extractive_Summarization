@entity1 and @entity2 better watch their step - they 've got rivals nipping at their heels in the form of a group of dancers from @entity9 who have become global twerking sensations			1
dubbed ' @entity9 's greatest export ' the dancers of @entity13 , in @entity14 , have achieved such acclaim the choreographer of @entity17 has paid a visit			1
@entity19 , who has also been the choreographer for @entity2 and @entity20 , has visited @entity21 and founder @entity22			1
the international spotlight on @entity22 's school came as a result of a video made by @entity40 , which has now amassed more than 30 million hits on @entity42			1
@entity22 said : ' i think we were incredibly lucky to find @entity45 , that video got so successful first because @entity47 reposted it - that immediately brought more people to us , and then the tune went on radio and tv and became really popular among dance hall dancers			1
' @entity47 is an electronic music project created by @entity56 dj and record producer @entity57 said : ' then the media noticed us - so now every week it adds a million more hits , i am not even always sure how it happens			2
the academy has gained global appeal after a video of the training regime of the some of the dancers was posted on the internet many of the school 's classes are held in the evening as the dancer either work or study during the day ' we filmed it not only to promote our school , but to show how great it is here in @entity9			1
it is fantastic to see that it worked , and naturally it helps our dancing centre 's popularity			1
' the video follows a women , who , despondent about the minus 42 c temperature , begins to dream of warmer climates			2
her daydream follows a group of scantily clad @entity92 dancers working some serious moves against a tropical looking sunset , before stripping down further to twerk on a sandy beach			0
apart from the sheer skill of the dance routine @entity25 is a great @entity9 business success story in @entity14 , our biggest city , and the third largest in @entity100			1
@entity22 said : ' i am aged 23 and was born here , i have lived here all my life			1
two years ago i got my diploma from the faculty of business at @entity107			0
' i began dancing when i was ten years old			0
for about seven years i was going to ' @entity109 ' dancing studio , and then began adding various master classes to improve my skills , including the foreign master classes			0
' then i began teaching myself and in 2010 i opened my own school			2
' the video , which has so far received over 30 million views on @entity42 follows the daydream of a young girl @entity119 , which is a separate style when you shake your derriere , has gained popularity in recent years the video which brought the academy worldwide fame sees the dancers move to the beach and strip down further besides the considerable talent of the dancers , it is not hard to see why the video has been viewed so many times owner of the school , @entity9 born @entity22 , 23 , regularly organizes dance competitions and battles for her dancers ' i am very grateful to my teacher @entity140 - she got me into hip - hop , house , dance hall , popping and locking styles			1
' in the end we chose dance hall , and later i got to vogue style			2
she got me to go to @entity149 for master classes , then i went for four trips to @entity152 to visit various dancing classes			0
' this is my life now - my school is my work , my business , the main thing i do			2
' our main classes are in the evening since our students either study or work , but there is a lot to do before that , and i constantly think about my school with a view to improving it			2
i want it to be bigger than just a dance class , though of course there are people that just want to come , have a dance class and leave			2
' but many other students want to learn dancing with a view to take part in competitions - and win			0
this is what we help them do			0
young ladies carefully watch themselves as they perform a ' twerking ' routine , for which @entity184 has become known for due to the sexual nature of twerking , the school only takes girls aged 16 or over ' it helped me to get business education , i went there with a thought of opening my own business one day			1
i am so happy it turned out that way			0
' we organise most of our city 's dance battles and competitions			1
the most recent and biggest of them was in may where we had eight choreographers , including our star guest @entity19			1
' as well as being @entity2 's choreographer , @entity19 was the leading lady in @entity206 's music video touch			1
she also starred in the 2008 movie @entity207 : the streets , in which she portrayed @entity210 , and appeared in the @entity212 revival of @entity213 as one of the @entity216 girls , @entity214			2
@entity22 said : ' the main goal for dancers is to take part in as many competitions outside @entity14 and @entity100 - and win - as possible '			1
' of course , it is not easy to travel as much as they wish as tickets can be expensive , and naturally it takes a lot of dedication to keep on training , sometimes months and months of endless rehearsals			0
many of the dancers who train at @entity231 want to take part in as many competitions outside @entity14 and @entity100 as possible ' my students went to @entity149 with me , soon we were going to the dancing camp			0
i 've been to @entity238 and twice won competitions in @entity240 and @entity241			0
' there is always a surprised reaction when people abroad hear that you came from @entity9			1
' it is so cold there , how on earth can you do training ? ' the right name for it is twerk , which is a separate style when you shake your derriere			0
@entity255 dance is more like its marketing , commercial name			0
' ' girls and women of different ages come to study it - well , except that i try to limit the youngest and stop them from doing it			0
' i think it is not correct from the moral point of view to teach 13 , 14 , 15 - year - old girls , because the movements carry a quite clear connotation			0
' they beg me to take them , and even their parents call me and plead to teach their children , saying that they give their permission			2
' it is certainly an energetic and beautiful dance routine , by my position is that you should start it from an older age - at least from 16 '			1
' perhaps you can compare us to @entity56 with their @entity282 where a person can come and ' dive ' into one particular dance style			0
' they 've inspired me to create something similar so that people from different cities can come and spend three months studying and working on one dance style			0
we are moving towards it gradually			0
