luckily he walked away from the wreck with no physical injuries he wrote on the ad : ' due to son thinking he 's @entity32 , i now have a 2000 @entity10 1.4 breaking for spares			1
' it seems a 1.4 was to much for him to handle			0
he talked the talk , but certainly did n't walk the walk - he will be walking now , for a long time			0
' if only all roads were straight , we as parents would n't have to worry about our over-enthusiastic sons			2
' it seems his ambition outweighed his talent on this occasion			0
i ca n't think why ! he 's been driving for over a week now ... ' one @entity47 ( free of charge ) 17 - year - old boy , complete with black eye - not from accident , administered by myself ! ' the car before it was in the accident			2
mr @entity7 said : ' he talked the talk , but certainly did n't walk the walk - he will be walking now , for a long time ' mr @entity7 , 55 , a former administration manager of a skip hire company , said today that he feared that if his son , @entity59 , continued to drive so badly , ' he wo n't see 18 '			1
