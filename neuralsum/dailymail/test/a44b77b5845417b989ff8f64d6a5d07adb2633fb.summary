@entity1 midfielders @entity2 and @entity3 are the surprise names on @entity6 ’s summer shopping list			1
the struggling @entity8 champions know they need more @entity10 players in their starting line - up — goalkeeper @entity12 has often been the only one this season — and @entity15 ’s @entity2 and @entity14 ’s @entity3 are deemed to be realistic targets			1
@entity6 also maintain an interest in @entity15 ’s unsettled @entity1 forward @entity18 , with 36 - year - old veteran @entity19 set to leave and 29 - year - old @entity20 likely to follow him out of the @entity21			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity3 ( right ) is a surprise target on @entity6 ’s summer shopping list @entity3 tries to cut inside during his appearance for @entity14 's under 21 side on tuesday night @entity15 's @entity2 is another surprise name among targets of @entity6 for this summer @entity6 also maintain an interest in @entity15 's unsettled forward @entity18 @entity2 , 24 , has come to @entity31 ’s attention because he has only one year left on his @entity15 contract			1
their concern about @entity3 , 23 , who has over two years left on his @entity14 deal , is his injury record			2
he has yet to return to @entity38 ’s side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in november			0
there is a well - trodden path between @entity14 and @entity6 over the past five years			2
the @entity44 club , who offer far bigger salaries , have spent £ 80million on @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
@entity19 was among the few @entity10 representatives for @entity6 at @entity53 @entity12 ( centre ) was the only @entity1 player that started while @entity20 ( right ) came on as a sub @entity3 played 90 minutes for @entity14 as he stepped up in his return from injury at the @entity58 @entity2 clears the ball during @entity15 's defeat by @entity14 at the @entity58 in the @entity8 and @entity6 will certainly need to make bids in excess of £ 30m to tempt @entity14 or @entity15 to sell			1
not all of @entity6 ’s targets will be @entity10 , though , with the club willing to use @entity66 star @entity47 and @entity67 forward @entity68 as bait in a deal to sign @entity72 midfielder @entity71			2
@entity71 , a 22 - year - old @entity66 international , was on @entity75 ’s books before moving to @entity76			0
@entity6 see him as the long - term successor to the fading @entity78 , although @entity71 could cost as much as £ 60m			0
@entity47 and @entity68 have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull			0
@entity72 midfielder @entity71 is another target of those at the @entity21 for this summer 's transfer market @entity71 , a 22 - year - old @entity66 international , was on @entity75 ’s books before leaving for @entity76			0

@entity6 know they need more @entity10 players in their line - up
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity12 has often been the only one this season
@entity1 's @entity2 and @entity3 are on their *wishlist*
city deem the @entity15 and @entity14 stars as realistic targets
@entity6 also maintain an interest in @entity15 forward @entity18
