@entity1 ’s elevation to the role of @entity4 executive chairman reinforces his commitment to the organisation , which he has led for the last 15 years			1
his promotion and the appointment of two non-executive independent directors in @entity10 and @entity11 , as revealed by @entity12 , was finally rubberstamped at thursday ’s club summit			1
the three - strong board will meet monthly to ensure proper scrutiny of @entity1 ’s increased powerbase , with the newcomers also attending the @entity4 ’s club summits six times a year			1
@entity1 was elevated to the role of @entity4 executive chairman on thursday @entity1 , who has recovered from serious heart surgery last summer , said : ‘ this is almost a re-commitment			1
this is n’t something you would do if you were about to leave			2
‘ look at me , i ’m up for it and my health is absolutely fine			2
this is a very enjoyable job			2
my enthusiasm for it has never waned			2
’ @entity10 , an @entity32 season ticket - holder , is a non-executive director of @entity33			2
she used to work at @entity34 and the @entity35			2
@entity36 is chairman of housebuilder @entity38			1
he was a board member of @entity40 during their financial troubles and is a @entity44 season ticket - holder			0
oddly , the @entity4 say he enjoys watching rugby and tennis			1
incoming @entity48 chairman @entity47 vows an inquiry if @entity50 do n't beat @entity51 in their test series @entity47 , the incoming chairman of the @entity48 , has already stated he expects @entity50 to beat a ‘ mediocre ’ @entity51 side in the @entity55 next month			1
and @entity47 will be in @entity56 for the last of the three tests , when head coach @entity58 and @entity50 managing director @entity59 will surely have to be shown the door if a series defeat follows the @entity63 debacle			0
@entity65 will definitely not be renewing their title sponsorship of the @entity4 when their £ 40million - a - year contract expires at the end of next season , clubs were told on thursday			1
the @entity4 will not be short of offers , even at a higher price , to endorse the world ’s richest league , with @entity74 said to be interested			1
@entity65 first raised doubts about their deal at the start of 2014 , when a senior executive was alleged to have said the sponsorship had ‘ zero value ’ in the @entity80			0
on top of that , group chief executive @entity82 does n’t like football			0
barclays have sponsored the @entity4 since 2001 but the 2015 - 16 season is set to be their last it will not help promoter @entity91 ’s negotiations with @entity92 over @entity94 ’s next fight that foreign exchange traders @entity95 , who heavily sponsored his first super-bantamweight world title defence on the network , have had their @entity101 offices raided by police			1
thirteen people were arrested on suspicion of fraud			0
the @entity106 trophy will be contested for at the home @entity63 , which begins in september around 350,000 @entity63 tickets being returned by the @entity109 to @entity110 are not expected to include many for @entity50 matches at @entity111			0
this is much to the annoyance of the official @entity114			0
they are upset at the number of @entity111 tickets that have gone to official hospitality , especially after being told they had priority status for @entity63 matches — apart from @entity50 at @entity111			0
@entity110 say they will have a ‘ few thousand ’ extra @entity50 tickets to put on sale , while corporate hospitality were given 21,000 tickets for @entity50 group games at @entity126			0
@entity128 chairman @entity127 is adamant more homegrown players need to play in @entity131 sides @entity4 clubs and @entity128 chairman @entity127 had a remarkably civil encounter on thursday considering their conflicting positions on @entity127 ’s campaign for more homegrown players			1
it was agreed there would be consultation on the issue after a club asked @entity127 whether he would force through changes			0
the @entity128 and @entity143 , their pr advisers , had been very bullish about making it happen after @entity127 announced his campaign last monday , but the @entity128 chairman rode back on thursday , telling clubs he only wanted debate			1
@entity50 rugby head coach @entity149 has just been told by @entity151 chief executive @entity150 that four runners - up finishes in the @entity153 is ‘ unacceptable ’			0
so it ’s not the best week for the @entity155 in @entity157 website to be promoting a video about @entity149 ‘ creating a winning formula for one of the most physical sports in the world ’			0
not yet he has n’t .			0

barclays have sponsored the @entity4 since 2001
