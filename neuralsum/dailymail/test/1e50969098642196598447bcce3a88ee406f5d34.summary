it 's constantly battling to protect us from terrorism and the host of other major threats in the modern world			1
so you might think @entity7 would have more important things to worry about than running a competition for @entity11 viewers to go to ‘ spy school ’			2
but that is exactly what has happened , after three youngsters won a competition to visit @entity7 ’s @entity17			1
the children even got to attend a meeting with the security service ’s director - general @entity20			1
