there 's nothing more exciting that when a whole league season comes down to the wire , with two or perhaps three teams still in contention right up to the last few weeks			0
but sir @entity7 's favourite phrase for this scenario , ' squeaky bum time ' , does n't begin to cover the current situation in @entity12 's @entity11			0
with four rounds of matches remaining , just 11 points split leaders @entity17 and bottom - placed @entity18 , meaning , theoretically , that any of the 16 teams in the league could still be crowned champions			1
the current state of the @entity24 table , which sees all 16 teams in with a shout of the championship @entity12 football fans are in for an exciting - if incredibly tense - final few rounds of the season the insanely tight league table means that a bad run for any of the teams in the top half could yet condemn them to relegation , while a series of wins for those near the bottom could yet propel them to glory			1
with 12 points left to play for , there is everything still to play for			2
the top two teams qualify for next year 's @entity47 , while the team in third make the @entity49 , @entity51 's equivalent of the @entity52			1
the @entity24 certainly has a claim to be the most exciting in the world at the moment three teams will be relegated to the second division and with the goal difference column all over the place , anything could happen yet			2
last year 's champions @entity61 are currently in fifth place but are just four points off the top			0
to add to the suspense , the league now pauses for a month			0
and it goes without saying that the final day of the season on june 12 will be a tense affair .			1

11 points split leaders @entity17 and bottom - placed @entity18 with four rounds of the @entity24 to play
all 16 teams could *mathematically* still win the championship
top two qualify for @entity47 while three are relegated
incredibly tense final day is *expected* on june 12
