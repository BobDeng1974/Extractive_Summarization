by @entity0 and @entity1 a report by the @entity3 says an independent @entity4 's start up costs would be ten times more than @entity6 has predicted an independent @entity4 would require ‘ start up costs ’ of £ 2.5billion – ten times more than @entity6 has claimed – according to an expert report			1
the respected @entity3 has warned the costs of creating the tax and welfare systems , defence force and a network of embassies would be vast			1
and if mr @entity6 has to set up a new currency , as @entity18 ministers have refused to let a separate @entity4 use the pound , the cost could increase by another £ 2billion			2
mr @entity6 has refused to publish his own figures but has suggested that a £ 250million price tag – less than the cost of the @entity23 – was ‘ reasonable ’			1
critics warned that the report paints a dire picture of the impact of separation on @entity4 ’s finances and public spending			2
the report also warns that an independent @entity4 would have to borrow £ 12billion a year , raise taxes or slash public spending to plug the gap in mr @entity6 ’s economic plans			2
@entity36 , a @entity37 mp , said : ‘ this latest expert analysis confirms what we already know – independence is n’t a price worth paying			0
‘ the @entity43 are asking us to take on all these extra costs to try to replicate what we already have today			1
where is the sense in every @entity4 family paying through the nose for something we already have today as part of the @entity18 ? ’ any money spent on start - up costs is money that could be spent on schools or hospitals			0
’ the @entity57 report increases pressure on the @entity59 to publish research on start - up costs before @entity4 go to the polls on 18 september			0
the figures , which represents about £ 1,000 for every @entity4 household , includes £ 1 billion for new tax and welfare systems , £ 400 million for a defence force and £ 450 million for foreign office real estate and offices , including about 100 embassies and consular offices			1
a @entity4 intelligence agency could add £ 200 million , based on deputy first minister @entity75 ’s estimate , while membership of the @entity79 , @entity76 and @entity77 could cost millions more , @entity57 said			1
@entity80 , the finance secretary , asked officials to come up with a figure more than two years ago , but it was not included in last year ’s @entity84 on independence			0
ministers have since said they can not even provide an estimate prior to negotiations with the @entity89 – which will only happen in the event of a @entity92 vote			0
the @entity93 has predicted the true cost of a separate @entity4 would be between £ 1.5billion and £ 2.7billion			0
despite this , mr @entity6 still described an estimate by professor @entity97 , of the @entity98 , of £ 250million as ‘ reasonable ’			1
mr @entity6 ( pictured during the tv debate with @entity100 last week ) has refused to publish his own figures but has suggested a £ 250million price tag – less than the cost of the @entity23 @entity104 , economist at the @entity57 , who wrote the report , said : ‘ setting up the kind of modern state that @entity4 is used to is not going to be cheap even with the capacity it already has , and even with a reasonable amount of negotiations between the two states in terms of asset division			1
‘ in the long run there is more viability within it , but this is a speed bump to get over and @entity4 will need a sensible approach from the @entity4 and @entity18 governments to successfully get this through because there is considerable risk			0
’ mr @entity104 said sharing the pound with the rest of the @entity18 would be ‘ fairly painless ’ in the short term – but a new currency would have to be launched sooner or later			0
the circulation of new notes and coins , and the creation of a central bank , would cost a further £ 2billion , they estimated			0
an @entity43 spokesperson said : ‘ the definitive expert report on set - up costs was published in june by professor @entity97 of the @entity98			2
that report was a total vindication of the @entity59 ’s position , and put costs at around £ 200 million , a figure which he made clear could be offset by savings and efficiencies – and also a figure which the @entity143 said he did not disagree with			2

@entity3 warned costs will be vast
is based on creating tax and welfare systems , a defence force and embassies
@entity43 first minister has suggested a £ 250million price tag if union breaks up
