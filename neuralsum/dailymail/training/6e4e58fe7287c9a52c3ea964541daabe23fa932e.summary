@entity0 hanged herself after she was admitted to hospital with a history of suicide attempts and left on her own for 20 minutes the family of a mother - of - three who killed herself after being left alone by hospital staff despite being admitted because she was distressed have branded the @entity8 a ' broken ' system			1
@entity0 , 42 , was suffering from depression and had a history of suicide attempts when she was admitted into @entity13 , and died two hours later in a side room of the @entity16 department			1
the former carer 's family said they feel let down by the health service and believe the ' broken system ' has led to staff cuts and a lack of knowledge about mental health , which meant she was left alone with enough time to hang herself			1
her husband said she had previously begged to be sectioned under the @entity28			0
@entity29 , 43 , said : ' if the @entity8 had n't been cutting corners then my sister would still be here			2
i do feel the @entity8 is a broken system that has failed us and shockingly it is n't just happening to us but everybody else			1
this broken system that we see in the news all the time i believe has led directly to my beloved sister 's death			1
' we hear so much in the news about it and loads has come out in terms of waiting times at @entity45 and staff shortages			2
how long can this go on for ? ' people are dying because of stupid mistakes			0
apparently it takes seven weeks for people who need psychiatric care to get help			0
' mrs @entity0 , who used to work as a carer at @entity54 in @entity55 , had been mourning the death in 2013 of her father - in - law but her depression worsened in october last year and she was twice admitted to hospital for trying to kill herself			1
on january 26 - a monday - mrs @entity0 went out for a walk saying she wanted to ' clear her head ' only to be found loitering at canal bridge at 10.30pm by a member of the public			1
an ambulance took her to the hospital where she was seen then left alone in a windowless room next to a nurses ' station			1
it is believed she shut the door and was left alone for about 20 minutes , during which she hanged herself			1
mrs @entity0 , of @entity55 , was found at 12.52am and died after attempts to revive her			1
her sister said they believed staff shortages meant mrs @entity0 was left alone , despite it being a monday evening which is often quieter			1
royal @entity80 is likely to face questions about its treatment of patients with mental health issues she added : ' it is ridiculous			2
it should never have happened and was so preventable			0
if more staff had been on that night , hand on my heart , i think my sister would still be alive			2
' they must have been just understaffed			0
people go to hospital for safety and treatment but nowadays it seems they are dying in there			2
it 's safer being in prison as at least inmates on suicide watch are checked every 10 minutes			1
' ms @entity29 said she believes her sister hanged herself as a ' cry for help ' and thought staff would be keeping an eye on her			0
mrs @entity0 ' sister @entity29 said she believe staff shortages are to blame for her death @entity110 said his wife had begged to be sectioned under the @entity28 after being admitted mrs @entity0 ' husband @entity112 , 47 , a caretaker at @entity113 in @entity114 said : ' this is the third time she has been to @entity16 and she has attempted suicide twice before and every time she has been discharged at the end of the night			1
plain and simple she should have been watched			0
they would have had her medical records with her past history			0
she should not have been allowed to close the door			0
he added : ' the fact someone could take their own life in an @entity16 is disgusting			2
there should have been one - to - one checks or someone sat with her			0
no one called me to let me know she was even there			0
so she did n't have anyone there for her			0
' if someone had checked her records they would realise not to leave her alone			0
if they had just made a phone call to me then she would still be here today			0
we would have had a conversation , i could have calmed her down and it would have been fine			0
i feel sorry for whoever found her			0
she should n't have been in @entity16			2
' mrs @entity0 ' family including her daughter @entity148 ( left ) , husband @entity112 ( centre ) and son @entity146 ( right ) said they feel they have been let down by the broken system of the @entity8 which led to staff shortages that evening mrs @entity0 had twice attempted suicide and is pictured with her daughters , @entity155 and @entity148 in 2011 @entity29 ( left ) and @entity148 ( centre ) said @entity8 cuts are directly to blame for the death of @entity0 ( right ) mr @entity110 is to make a formal complaint about the treatment of his wife			1

dr @entity168 , acting medical director at @entity13 , said : ' our sympathies are with the patient 's family at this very difficult time			1
this tragic incident is now the subject of a coroner 's inquest and the @entity13 will be undertaking a multi-agency investigation into the circumstances that led to this and for this reason , we are unable to comment further			1
' concerns have previously been raised about a lack of support for patients with mental health problems at @entity80 ’s emergency department			2
mr and mrs @entity0 married in 2006 and the widower says he is to make a formal complaint to the hospital last year , the @entity191 highlighted delays for patients requiring psychiatric assessments , and ordered the hospital to carry out a review of its facilities and resources			1
it found that despite an agreement for mental health practitioners to respond within one hour of being called , staff and managers said this was ‘ frequently not achieved ’			2
the hospital ’s procedures were also called into question after a 53 - year - old male patient , @entity209 , hanged himself in the @entity210 , which works closely with the emergency department			2
he was admitted in january last year after taking an intentional overdose of insulin , and had been assessed by a mental health liaison nurse as being at high risk of further suicide attempts			1
coroner @entity217 criticised the hospital ’s safeguarding procedures during an inquest last summer , which prompted a ‘ thorough review and improvement plan ’			0
the death of mrs @entity0 may also pose questions for @entity225 , which provides the mental health liaison service with the hospital			1
