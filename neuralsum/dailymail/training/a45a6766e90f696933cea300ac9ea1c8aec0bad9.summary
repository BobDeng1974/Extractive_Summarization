military officers have slammed a sexual assault survey as ' intrusive ' and ' offensive ' after being forced to answer detailed , graphic personal questions			1
the questionnaire is conducted every two years , taking responses from hundreds of thousands of servicemen and women			1
however , the @entity8 this year altered the wording to be much more explicit and detailed in order to get more accurate results as the military struggles to reduce its sexual assaults			0
' intrusive ' : @entity14 , senior executive adviser for the @entity15 and @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , has been slammed for the survey which military members brand ' intrusive ' here is a sample question , one of a series of 11 graphic questions out of 34 developed by the @entity25 some are even more detailed : ' before 9/18/2013 , had anyone made you insert an object or body part into someone 's mouth , vagina or anus when you did not want to and did not consent ? ' a number of military members told @entity37 that they were surprised and upset by the questions , and some even said they felt re-victimized by the blunt language			1
none of them would speak publicly by name , but @entity8 officials confirmed they had received complaints that the questions were ' intrusive ' and ' invasive			1
' the survey questions , which were obtained by @entity37 , ask about any unwanted sexual experiences or contact , and include very specific wording about men 's and women 's body parts or other objects , and kinds of contact or penetration			1
it begins with questions about sexual harassment , asking about jokes , ' sexual gestures or sexual body movements , ' requests to take or share sexually suggestive pictures or videos or efforts to establish ' an unwanted romantic or sexual relationship			0
' ' we 've had a number of complaints , ' said @entity71 , director of the @entity73 's sexual assault prevention program			1
' i 've heard second - and third - hand that there are a number of women , officers and enlisted , who have gotten to the point where they 've read the questions and they 've stopped taking the survey			1
they found them to be either offensive or too intrusive — ' intrusive , invasive ' — those are the words they used			0
' about 560,000 active duty , @entity88 and @entity90 members were invited to fill out the questionnaire — about five times the number the survey was sent to two years ago			1
officials will not say how many responses they have received so far			1
early last year , a report on the 2012 anonymous survey results set off a furor when it estimated that 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted or subjected to unwanted sexual contact			1
exasperated members of @entity102 complained that the @entity8 was n't doing enough to combat sexual assault and tried , largely unsuccessfully , to force changes in the @entity8 's legal and command procedures			0
in addition to the @entity25 questions , @entity71 said the @entity73 sends its own survey to sailors and @entity110 that does n't get as specific			1
she added , ' we think we 've done a very good job of trying to make people aware of what sexual assault is			0
' but @entity25 analysts say the more detailed questions are necessary			0
so does @entity14 , the senior executive adviser for the @entity8 's sexual - assault prevention office			1
' this is a crime of a very graphic nature , ' @entity14 said			0
' for us to improve our understanding , it sometimes requires asking tough questions			0
' he said the @entity8 hired @entity25 to develop and conduct the survey this year , based on new direction from @entity102 that the effort be fully independent of the @entity8			0
he was aware of the complaints but said that the more succinct the questions are , the more accurate the results will be			2
' research has told us , if i ask someone , ' have you ever been raped ? ' they will say , ' no , '' @entity14 said			0
' if i ask that same person , ' have you ever been forced to engage in sexual activity against your will ? ' they might say ' yes			0
' it 's because of the loaded terms like rape and sexual assault , that it 's not very clear to a lot of people what we may be asking about			0
' @entity150 , one of the project leaders at @entity25 , said participants were told they could skip questions they found upsetting , or simply not take the survey			2
in the end , she said , @entity25 received a ' relatively small ' number of complaints			2
she said research suggests that ' the discomfort from being asked about prior trauma in a confidential survey is temporary and that such questions cause no additional long - term harm to previously traumatized persons			1
' @entity165 , the other project leader , said the questions were based on the @entity167			0
' if you do n't use precise language to describe different types of sexual assault and harassment , people define those terms for themselves in different ways , which leads to ambiguous results , ' he said			0
the report on the 2012 survey , which was released early last year , showed sexual assault incidents rose from about 19,000 in the 2010 survey to 26,000			2
those totals far outdistance the number of sexual assaults that are actually reported by members of the military			0
according to the latest report , the number of sexual assaults jumped by 50 percent last year as the military worked to get more victims to come forward			2
over the past two years , the military services have tried to increase awareness			2
phone numbers and contact information for sexual assault prevention officers are plastered across military bases , including inside the doors of bathroom stalls			1
and top military officers have traveled to bases around the world speaking on the issue			1
in the 2012 anonymous survey , about 6.8 percent of women who answered said they were assaulted and 1.2 percent of men			2
there are vastly more men in the military ; so by the raw numbers , a bit more than 12,000 women said they were assaulted , compared with nearly 14,000 men .			0

thousands of servicemen and women take assault survey every 2 years
it has been made more graphic to crack down on assault in military
officers *blasted* ' intrusive ' questions , victims felt *'re* - victimized '
