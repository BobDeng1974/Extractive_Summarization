a video experiment has shown most urban @entity1 will leap to the defence of a @entity4 person singled out for abuse , even in the wake of the country 's recent @entity8 terror attack			2
one angry resident of @entity11 , @entity12 , punched a man playing the part of an @entity15 having a go at a man wearing @entity4 - style clothing at a bus stop			1
he was left bleeding from his nose for the part he played in what the @entity24 filmmakers called a ' social experiment ' this is what happens to racists in @entity12 : after playing the part of an islamophobe for a @entity24 video ' social experiment ' this man was left with a bloody nose after he was punched in the face by an angry @entity1 ' this is based on the events that happened in @entity38 , ' said @entity24 filmmaker @entity39 , referring to recent bloodshed in the @entity1 capital			1
' we 're going to see if people feel safe to be around @entity4 or people that look like @entity4			0
' within seconds of the filmmakers beginning their first charade - which involved a one telling another one wearing @entity4 - style clothes he ca n't board a bus - a middle - aged man objects to the apparent racism			1
' you know what ? you ca n't stereotype and judge people by their clothes , ' the casually dressed , silver - haired white man objects			0
' or their nationalities or anything else , you know what i mean ? ' ' you ca n't judge and stereotype people by their clothes ' : the scene as a middle - aged man in blue jeans and leather jacket , centre , defends the man in @entity4 dress after he is accosted by the man on the right no time for racism : the man was just one of many who stood up for the man dressed as a @entity4 the filmmakers repeat their play in several different locations , to get a range of responses			1
although the footage is edited and not continuous , it seems they found difficulty finding anyone to go along with the racist behaviour			0
asked to think of the recent shooting of corporal @entity92 at @entity1 's national war memorial , a woman responds : ' it was awful and tragic , but i do n't think that 's any reason to persecute some just because of what they 're wearing			1
' the video , published yesterday , has already attracted nearly 200,000 views and a storm of comment			0
the location was poignant , @entity11 is the hometown of corporal @entity92 and it was today the emotional scene of his funeral procession , led by his five - year - old son @entity110			1
burnishing @entity1 's credentials as a tolerant , multicultural nation , the video shows @entity1 of a range of ethnicities and walks of life objecting to vocal racism and @entity15			2
finally , a hot - headed man in a baseball cap decides he 's had enough of the haranguing being dished out to the @entity4 man			0
he sneaks up next to the ' racist ' and sucker punches him in the face			2
speaking to camera , the man who played the role of the racist concluded : ' so err			0
. the social experiment had a negative ending to it but , you know what ? it 's positive because he stood up for him and i appreciate that			0

three filmmakers contrived the *scenario* in @entity11 , @entity12
that 's the home town of murdered *soldier* corporal @entity92
there was no *shortage* of people willing to stand up to racism and *bullying*
eventually the filmmaker playing part of the racist got punched in the face
