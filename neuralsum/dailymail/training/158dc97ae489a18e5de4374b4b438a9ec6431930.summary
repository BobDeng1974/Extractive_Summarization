famous @entity1 sir @entity0 loved @entity2 dearly and it 's certainly no stretch to say that before he made history as @entity6 's longest - serving prime minister he had seriously contemplated a career in @entity9 politics			1
however , his allegiance to the @entity11 was sorely tested in 1956 by his @entity9 counterpart , sir @entity12 , during the @entity14 crisis			1
the @entity15 pre-dated the @entity16			0
it became a flash point in the relationship between the @entity9 and the @entity20 , and @entity6 's most revered leader was caught up , smack - bang in the middle			1
it 's a story outlined in the latest book on the political life of sir @entity0 , ' the @entity27 ' , written by another @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity0 and @entity30 at a @entity32 reception in 1954			0
@entity6 's longest serving pm always had a close affinity with the royals and the @entity9 the early political days			1
@entity0 walks through a guard of honour in 1941 at @entity37 in @entity38 the stand - off over the @entity40 was sparked by @entity43 president @entity42 move to take control of the canal - so pivotal to global trade at the time - from @entity2 and @entity47 in his book , mr @entity29 calls the @entity40 crisis as ' a series of events variously described as the last gasp of the @entity53 , a meltdown in trust between the @entity20 and @entity2 , a crisis that destroyed the career of @entity9 prime minister sir @entity12			1
. a worldwide political drama that saw , for a time , our own prime minister , @entity0 , at its very centre '			1
the stand - off over @entity40 was sparked after @entity43 president @entity42 moved to take control of the canal - so pivotal to global trade at the time - from @entity2 and @entity47			1
the @entity65 then started to consider how it could wrest back the trade route from @entity43 , according to mr @entity29 's account			2
@entity69 strongman , @entity42 , the then @entity43 president , successfully called the western powers ' bluff over their warnings of military action over control of the @entity14 , much to the detriment of @entity0 at a pivotal meeting this scene is of an @entity79 , which brought together no less than five prime ministers and a governor general			1

seated ( l to r ) @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity0 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 some big political names go for a stroll outside @entity93 in @entity32 with @entity0 ( far left ) joined by @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 nearing the end of his long reign , this is the @entity0 ministry photographed prior to the 1963 election western nations met in @entity105 for crisis talks , with @entity20 secretary of state @entity107 taking the lead in early negotiations			2
however , @entity107 soon withdrew from the talks , telling his president @entity111 he was to return home as ' it is preferable that we ( the @entity20 ) become less conspicuous '			0
at that time the @entity20 economy was not reliant on trade through the canal , unlike much of @entity118			0
the @entity20 also knew the @entity119 were far from financially secure post @entity120 , and that a crisis over @entity40 could potentially help the @entity20 â€™ position as the world 's growing superpower			0
@entity0 had been due to return to @entity6 from a meeting of @entity127 prime ministers in @entity105 but as the drama over @entity40 began to unfold , he decided to personally take control of @entity6 's role in the discussions			1
the @entity133 president @entity132 introduces his young daughter @entity134 to @entity0 and @entity135 in 1959			0
she would go on to also become president of @entity133 sir @entity0 was a devoted cricket follower and is pictured here with sir @entity138 ( far right ) and the @entity140 captain of the day in 1963 , @entity141			1
they are seen in @entity32 for the traditional @entity28 's @entity143 whether the @entity9 was miffed at @entity0 ' insistence that , while @entity6 would support the @entity9 in action against @entity43 , it would be without troops , is unclear			1
what is certain , though , is that the @entity119 were not pleased when @entity150 's request for an @entity6 warship to be placed in @entity152 was met with no more than ' a cagey response '			0
with @entity107 ' departure , it was @entity0 who was charged with delivering a plan devised during an international meeting in @entity105 to @entity42			0
the plan included the potential for @entity20 - backed military action			1
however , @entity111 publicly denounced the use of force and @entity0 was effectively left with a document not worth the paper it was written on			0
an increasingly brusque @entity42 knew that ' @entity111 had given @entity42 a green light to rebuff @entity0 , ' mr @entity29 wrote in his book			2
@entity169 holding a cartoon of himself and worse was to follow for @entity0			0
he continued to back the @entity9 cause but with one eye still fixed on the @entity20			2
subsequently he was sidelined when @entity2 , @entity47 and @entity174 agreed on a bizarre cloak and dagger proposal , in which the latter would invade @entity43 , providing a pretext for the @entity9 and @entity47 to issue a cease - fire ultimatum to both @entity174 and @entity43			1
' this agreement was recorded in the @entity180 , which remained secret for many years , ' wrote mr @entity29			0
ultimately , @entity43 refused the ultimatum and an @entity183 invasion of @entity43 then took place , sparking international condemnation , championed by the @entity20 , and leading to a cowering withdrawal			2
the debacle broke @entity150 , who resigned			0
in summarising the event , mr @entity29 made very clear that he believed @entity150 had been less than frank with his ally in @entity0			2
' even allowing for the less discreet and rapid communications at that time , @entity150 's failure to consult @entity0 before the issuing of the ultimatum to @entity174 and @entity194 was poor treatment of a loyal ally , ' he wrote			1
@entity29 is @entity6 's second longest serving @entity28 , behind only sir @entity0			1
his book ' the @entity27 ' is a candid account of those years in @entity6 ' @entity40 was significant for @entity169 , ' wrote mr @entity29			2
' it placed him in the world spotlight as the man who presented the proposal for international control of the canal to @entity42			0
always a tough brief to argue , it became impossible once @entity111 had pronounced , " we are committed to a peaceful settlement of this dispute , nothing else			0
" ' ' most distressing of all to @entity0 was the poisonous atmosphere that developed between @entity105 and @entity213 over @entity40 ; it challenged a world view which had governed his thinking for a decade , ' stated mr @entity29			2
' to him there would never be tension between his @entity219 instincts and his realistic acceptance that @entity20 now dominated the free world , because those two " great and powerful friends " would always be of one mind on important international issues			0
but they were not so on @entity40			0
' ' the @entity27 ' recalls the longest unbroken period of government for one side of politics in @entity6 's history			2

sir @entity0 was caught in the middle of a power play by the @entity20 and @entity2 over the @entity15 in 1956
@entity0 was thrust into the centre of a worldwide political drama when made the *messenger* by his @entity9 counterpart sir @entity12
his threat of likely military action was ridiculed by the then @entity43 president and then he was sidelined during key meetings
former pm @entity29 calls @entity2 's *behaviour* of @entity0 during that period as ' poor treatment of a loyal ally '
the book also contains rare images of @entity0 during his time as @entity6 prime minister , giving an insight into his record stint in power
