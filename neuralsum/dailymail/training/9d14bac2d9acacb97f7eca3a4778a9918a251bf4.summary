the margin of victory required for @entity1 was only secured in the last minute though as @entity6 cornerback @entity31 picked off @entity7 quarterback @entity32 and returned the ball 22 yards for a touchdown			0
naturally the @entity35 took to @entity17 to celebrate his success - posting his betting slip - as he did with his @entity10 and @entity11 successes			0
@entity1 laid his latest bet with @entity40 at the @entity41 in @entity42 , and the company 's vice president of race and sports , @entity43 , confirmed the bet to @entity48			0
' @entity1 did n't watch the game here , ' @entity43 said , ' but he certainly showed up shortly thereafter to cash			0
