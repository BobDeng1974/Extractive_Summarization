i grieve for the deceased and the country ” , ’ mr @entity23 told @entity54			1

the taxi driver thanked him and said ‘ it ’s so good to know there are good @entity34 who understand ’			2
mr @entity23 said he hoped ‘ one of the lessons coming out of it [ the siege ] is the need for greater financial resources to go into treating the mentally ill ’			1
