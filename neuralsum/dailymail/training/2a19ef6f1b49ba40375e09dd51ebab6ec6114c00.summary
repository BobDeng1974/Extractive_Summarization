@entity1 's acting career has recently seen a complete turnaround			1
having played the psychopathic killer @entity3 in the @entity5 series @entity6 , his latest project has seen him take on a more angelic role			2
@entity1 has recently been filming the new series of @entity10 where he plays the troubled reverend @entity11			1
@entity1 , who played the psychopathic killer @entity3 in the @entity5 series @entity6 , looks cool and casual as he poses for @entity14 's online magazine in his interview with @entity14 's online magazine , @entity1 admits that his recent change in character has confused some of his fans			1
he said : ' the funniest is when people see me in a dog collar , when the public gather on set when we 're filming @entity27 , and you can see them looking at me , and trying to process this memory of a psychopath now wearing a dog collar and trying to marry the two together			2
' playing the local vicar should come as a welcome relief to the 29 - year - old actor , who says that his role in @entity37 occasionally took its toll			1
@entity1 explained that getting into character was something that required a great amount of investment from him			1
' getting into the mindset of a guy like @entity46 , who i played in @entity6 , it 's a lot of work			2
i was put in touch with a psychologist and watched lots of films , and you have to try and empathise as much as you can with his position			2
' making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to @entity1 , who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian , he reveals in the candid interview @entity1 , who looks dapper in a series of suits from @entity14 , explained that getting into character was something that required a great amount of investment from him he says that although his part was testing , the experience taught him a lot about the human psyche and he even began to sympathise with @entity46			1
' i think the mistake lots of people make when it comes to a psychopath is that they completely write off their actions as cruel , callous and completely calculated but actually the truth is that they have interests and reasons behind their actions			2
' they commit these acts of brutal murder and cruelty in order to survive , because they see the world as inherently hostile and if they do n't attack , the world will attack them			2
' @entity1 ' understanding of the role had n't always been so well educated and he explained that perhaps his desperation to play @entity46 showed in his first audition , where he admits to coming across as a little try - hard			1
' i was desperate to show them that i could play a ruthless psychopath , so i turned up at the read - through with these big black boots on and a trench coat and sat by the tea table , and did n't look or speak to anyone			0
i just tried to be really enigmatic and dark and sinister and then , eventually , of course , they found out			0
' he revealed that he really admires @entity110 , who played @entity111 in @entity112			0
' he 's become a mentor , ' he said of the actor @entity1 reveals that he is a huge fan of clothes , and loves @entity14			1
' all my underwear is @entity14 , ' he shared as he poses in trunks by a pool before his stint as a kidnapper , @entity1 took on several other television and film roles and even appeared in @entity124 , but @entity123 was easily his big break			1
making a name for himself in the acting industry is something that is really important to @entity1 who has spent his life trying to prove himself as a thespian			1
@entity1 says that he has always had extremely supportive parents , with his father even appearing as an extra in several productions , but the @entity136 actor admits that not everyone is as understanding when it comes to pursuing a career in the arts			1
' it takes a lot of courage , when everyone is asking you what you want to do , if you say that you want to be a musician or an actor , people can be very condescending and say , " oh , that 's so sweet , good luck with that ! " it can be very frustrating			0
' i think that 's one of the most important things about studying drama at an institution , you go , " i am now a professional			0
" i can say that to people and i do n't care if they 're condescending because i know that this is my life and this is what i 've dedicated those three years to			0
' @entity1 says that he has always had extremely supportive parents , with his father even appearing as an extra in several productions the actor explains that he had the acting bug from a very early age and loved storytelling as a child despite his success , @entity1 has his head screwed on and remains humble			1
' i 've been pretty lucky , the last few years with @entity6 and then @entity27 have been very special , so i 'm waiting for that duff job or the diva - ish cast or aggressive director ! ' it 's no wonder he 's loving every minute ; @entity1 , who admires @entity110 , says that he had the acting bug from a very early age and was always the kid who loved telling stories , putting them on as theatre and then insisting that his parents and all their friends would sit down and watch them			2
' i grew up in the countryside so i had quite a feral life up until the age of about fourteen , ' he recalls			0
' i had the safety of that environment so i was able to run wild and let loose			0
it was totally idyllic , like an @entity192 that was mine with no dangers or threats			0
and then at the age of fifteen , i realised there was a party going on elsewhere that i was n't invited to , and suddenly the @entity192 - like paradise of the countryside felt incredibly limiting - i became very oppressive and adolescent , and then was a nightmare for the rest of my teenage years			0
' today , he is loving every minute of his acting career and feels blessed to be among so much @entity136 talent			0
' as far as people i 'd like to work with , the list is endless , ' he says			0
' i think to work with @entity209 would be amazing , and then some of the @entity136 talent we have ; @entity212 , @entity213 , both of whom i have met and admired for a long time			0
we 're very blessed in this country , there is so much talent for people to work with and learn from			0
