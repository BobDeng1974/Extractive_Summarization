wearing your pants too low in @entity2 , @entity3 , is about to get expensive			1
the popular shore town , which is a favorite for holidaymakers , has passed a law banning overly saggy pants with fines ranging from $ 25 to $ 200			1
the vote was unanimously agreed by the @entity11 and mayor @entity12 , who passed the city ordinance in the name of decency and safety			2
according to the new law , when on @entity2 ’s boardwalk : - shoes or flip - flops must be worn at all times			1
- a shirt must be on after 8 pm until 5am the next morning			0
- pants , swim shorts , and skirts must not hang more than three inches past the person ’s waist			1
regulations : visitors to the boardwalk in @entity2 , @entity3 , will be subjected to dress regulations , including pants no lower than three inches below the waistline ' we ’re not trying to set the world on fire here			1
we ’re just trying to give a little bit better appearance to the public about what the city of @entity2 is , ' said @entity12			1
the mayor maintains from emails to calls , the feedback so far has been mostly positive			0
@entity12 explained , ' we just want you to take into consideration , if you have family or elderly people or people who just do n’t want to look at your rear end , just have a little decency			0
just pull your pants up			1
' but one local , @entity54 , who calls @entity2 home and enjoys dressing how he likes , said : ' you should have the freedom to do what you want on a beach			1
' the problem is what he considers his ' freedom ' , some find offensive			0
@entity64 of @entity2 explained , ' there ’s a big difference between freedom of expression and indecent exposure			1
' @entity70 , also of @entity2 added , ' what are you trying to say ? it ’s just not understandable , it just offends			1
' @entity75 of @entity76 , @entity74 questioned , ' how come they can tell you how to dress ? it ’s a public place , i do n’t understand that			0
' coming to @entity82 ? a billboard is seen in @entity84 , asking residents to raise their pants was seen in 2010 opponents do n’t like what they ’re hearing , neither does @entity54 but he understands rules are rules			2
@entity54 said , ' yea i have to because if not , i do n’t feel like going to the big house			0
' police will first ask violators to comply with the law			0
barring that , they ’ll be asked to leave the boardwalk			2
refuse – and tickets are issued			0
we ’re told jail time is possible but the mayor says , it is his hope that it never gets that far			0
' we do n’t want anybody to be asked to leave the boardwalk , we do n’t want anybody to receive a ticket			2
if he wants to be a thug and say , ‘ do n’t tell me what to do ’ , then he will be asked to leave and then it ’s in his ballpark			0
' you can become a real wise guy and wind up taking a trip to jail or you can get a ticket , ' @entity12 said			0
the proposed law would set fines of $ 25 to $ 100 for a first offense and $ 200 for subsequent offenses			1
having to do community service is also a possibility			0
the law is set to go into effect during the 4th of july weekend			0
mayor @entity123 said the shoe requirement was a safety issue , while the clothing rules reflect the town 's values and the image it wants to project			2
' i know the social climate 's changed and what people think is decent is different than it was , ' @entity12 said			2
commissioner @entity136 said he supported the ordinance in its current form			0
' i think it 's obnoxious with these kids who wear their pants down around their knees , ' @entity136 said , adding he sometimes receives complaints from people unhappy with the style of dress			1
other towns such as @entity148 and @entity149 have some regulation in place regarding clothing on their respective promenade and boardwalk			2
