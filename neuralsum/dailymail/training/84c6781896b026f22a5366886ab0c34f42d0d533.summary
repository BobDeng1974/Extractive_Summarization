' @entity92 added : ' all the production did happen outside the @entity109 - the @entity2 and other places			2

' at one stage @entity168 lodged an appeal saying customs officials had abused their position by checking his possessions in such detail at the airport - but all the parties worked together to oppose the appeal and ultimately secure his prison sentence			2
' much of the evidence in the case centred on the testimony of the @entity60 boy we identified as being among his victims			0
