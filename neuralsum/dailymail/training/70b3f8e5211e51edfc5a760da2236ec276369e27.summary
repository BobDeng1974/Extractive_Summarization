by @entity0 traffic judge : judge @entity2 does n't usually have freedom of speech cases come through his traffic court hauling a truckload of logs to a @entity9 mill last fall , @entity5 noticed a sheriff 's deputy behind him and flashed his lights to warn a @entity13 driver coming the other way			1
the deputy pulled over @entity5 on @entity16 140 in @entity17 and handed him a $ 260 ticket for improperly using his headlights , saying another deputy had seen the flashing lights from behind the @entity13 truck and alerted him to stop the log truck because of the signaling			1
outraged , @entity5 decided to fight the ticket , and on wednesday , a @entity27 judge dismissed the citation , finding that motorists flashing their headlights amounts to speech protected by the @entity32			1
judge @entity33 determined the law covering the use of high beams was valid , but was unconstitutional as it was applied by the deputy			2
' the citation was clearly given to punish the defendant for that expression , ' the judge wrote			0
' the government certainly can and should enforce the traffic laws for the safety of all drivers on the road			2
however , the government can not enforce the traffic laws , or any other laws , to punish drivers for their expressive conduct			1
' the @entity52 did not return a telephone call for comment			0
@entity5 , 38 , of @entity55 , has been driving truck for 10 years , and was not interested in seeing his insurance rates go up for getting a ticket			0
he initially told the deputy that the @entity13 driver was his neighbor , and he was just saying hello			1
' my point to the cop was his partner did n't know why i was flashing my lights , ' @entity5 said			2
' he could n't tell for sure what i was doing			0
' by the time his case went to court last month , @entity5 had researched the law and found nothing that expressly prohibited the use of headlights to signal other drivers			1
he also recalled a tv news story about a federal judge in the @entity76 barring police from handing out tickets to drivers who flashed their lights to warn others of a speed trap ahead			2
fought the law : @entity5 fought his $ 260 ticket issued for flashing his headlights to warn another driver of police presence - and won ' i thought , ' well , i 'll throw that in there , too , " ' he said			1
acting as his own attorney in a hearing conducted by telephone , @entity5 said he acknowledged the @entity13 driver was n't his neighbor , and he raised the free speech argument			1
' what i did was n't illegal , whether it 's freedom of speech or not , ' he told @entity0			0
@entity97 , director of the @entity98 of @entity9 , noted the @entity99 overturned a traffic law prohibiting horn honking for non-traffic purposes on similar grounds in the 1990s after a number of people got tickets for honking in support of @entity16 troops during the first @entity109			0
' if the motive of the sheriff 's deputies was in fact not to make the roads safer , but to raise more revenue from traffic enforcement , that would be even more reason why it should be unconstitutional , ' @entity97 said			0
' if this is part of a pattern , then it probably would be worth us looking into it in more detail			0
