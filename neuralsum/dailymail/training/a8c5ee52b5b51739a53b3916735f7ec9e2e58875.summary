@entity2 's @entity1 recall has been confirmed with the rejuvenated sale fly - half in the national squad flying to @entity5 on tuesday ahead of the three - @entity7 series against the @entity5			1
the 26 - year - old has turned his fortunes around in the last 12 months and recent events have conspired to leave him on course for a first @entity7 appearance since 2008			1
he has been named in a group of 30 departing for @entity15 - with another tranche of players from @entity18 and @entity19 due to fly out next monday , after the @entity20			1
head coach @entity21 will choose his team for the series opener at @entity24 from the initial contingent and @entity2 is one of just two @entity26 included , along with @entity27			1
the man who is joining @entity29 from @entity30 this summer is considered to be the prime contender to fill the playmaker 's role in the first test , in the absence of three domestic rivals			2
made his point : @entity2 issues orders during @entity1 training at the @entity40 earlier this month hitting form : @entity2 has impressed for sale in the @entity20 during the last 12 months forwards : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61			1
backs : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity27 , @entity2 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			1
' both @entity27 and @entity2 have great opportunities to put a marker down as genuine international fly - halves , ' said @entity21			1
' @entity76 [ @entity77 ] and @entity78 have been exceptional this season and they will be considered post these games this weekend			2
but now it 's in @entity27 and @entity2 's court			1
they 've trained great so far so we 're looking forward to seeing how they get on			0
' @entity2 has done well , he 's come up to speed ; he 's got to know the plays			1
he 's built relationships with the players and he 's been good - it 's a similar defensive structure for him to the one at @entity42			1
' he 's excited about being here			0
we 'll make the decision on fly - half on what happens in training and what happens in the next week or so			2
' @entity77 and @entity96 can not be considered for the opening clash with @entity99 's world champions , so soon after the @entity20			0
and @entity100 of @entity101 has been ruled out of the tour , due to the pressing need for an operation on his damaged shoulder			0
so if @entity27 is chosen to start , @entity2 is likely to act as the back - up stand - off on the bench , unless @entity68 returns to full fitness earlier than expected and can provide cover if required			1
' @entity68 [ @entity110 ] is going well , ' said @entity111			0
' he has n't trained yet , and it 's unlikely he 'll train ( on tuesday ) before we fly , but we 're optimistic enough to take him on the initial flight with a view to assessing him when we get out there			0
' he 's really going to have to be training fully at the start of that test week in order to be considered			0
" but he 's certainly made enough progress to be under consideration for the first test and definitely for the second , so that 's why he 's on the plane			0
' elsewhere , there are only two scrum - halves in the initial party ; @entity63 and @entity64 - so the management must hope that neither of them come to any harm in the run - up to the series			2
once the club season comes to an end , it appears that @entity137 and @entity138 will come out as reinforcements in that position			0
explosive impact : @entity2 looked to be a world - class star in the making during his early days with @entity1 shunned the celebrity lifestyle : @entity2 is now more associated with playing a starring role for @entity146 ( right ) than being pictured with glamorous women , such as former girlfriend @entity148 ( left ) @entity57 is back in favour , having last played a test for his country in march last year , when @entity1 slumped to a record 30 - 3 defeat against in @entity153			1
the @entity155 flanker must have a strong chance of starting the first test at blindside , in the absence of @entity18 's @entity160			0
there are seven uncapped players in the group ; @entity71 , @entity46 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity56 and @entity67			0
@entity71 is rewarded for a sensational season for relegated @entity165 , while @entity171 - @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity50 will all tussle for the starting hooker place if @entity52 fails to recover from injury in time - although the @entity101 player is also included in the squad			2
the presence of @entity71 is an indication that @entity101 wing @entity174 is destined to miss the trip			0
the turbo - charged rookie suffered a suspected hamstring injury during friday 's @entity180 defeat to @entity18 in @entity153 .			2

@entity2 has overcome *bad* - boy *reputation* in last 12 months
@entity21 has picked @entity42 star in his 30 - man @entity1 squad
@entity2 has not played for @entity1 since 2008
@entity1 set to face @entity5 in three - @entity7 series
