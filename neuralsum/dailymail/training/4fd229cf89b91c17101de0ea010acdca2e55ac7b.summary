@entity0 has promised to ‘ do it my way ’ as he takes charge of @entity5 in sunday ’s fourth one - day international against @entity6			1
with @entity7 suspended after presiding over a slow over-rate during wednesday ’s win in @entity10 , @entity0 has the chance to lead his adopted country to an unlikely series - levelling victory			1
and @entity0 , who is without a half - century in his last 15 one - day innings , backed himself to end a slump that has prompted @entity17 to blame what he views as the relentless coaching of @entity20 — or , as @entity17 referred to him in a recent tweet , the ‘ woodpecker ’			1
@entity0 prepares to catch the ball during an @entity5 nets session in @entity25 the man who will captain @entity5 against @entity6 on sunday takes a rest during training @entity0 prefers to put his mediocre form down to two factors : a loss of focus on his own game during the first half of the summer against the @entity37 and the excellence of @entity40 ’s one - day bowling			1
he said : ‘ with the turnaround in all the backroom staff at the start of the summer , and guys having different inputs , as a senior player you want to be involved as much as you can			2
i probably neglected my side of the game			2
i ’d spent a lot of energy off the field			0

‘ so there ’s no use going into my shell or not playing any more shots			0
i ’m a gambler and i ’d say i ’m due to get a score			1
i ’ve got to stay true to myself			0

‘ i ’ve always enjoyed captaining , ’ he said			2
‘ having not been a bowler since i was about 17 , it gives you another string to your bow			0
‘ it also takes a bit of attention away from your batting so maybe it will contribute to me getting some runs			2
’ before wednesday ’s five - wicket win , any talk of @entity5 winning the series would have been greeted with incredulity			2
but @entity0 said : ‘ you can see the belief in the guys ’ eyes			2
they gained a lot of confidence from the other night			0
’ the slot in the line - up opened up by @entity7 ’s absence could go to @entity109 ’s middle - order batsman @entity108 , the only member of the 15 - man squad yet to get a game here			1
off - spinner @entity112 is likely to return after being left out at @entity10			0
