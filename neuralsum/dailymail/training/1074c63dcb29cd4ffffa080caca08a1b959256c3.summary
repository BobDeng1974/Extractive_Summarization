commons speaker @entity0 , right , with his wife @entity1 has been criticised over his plan to appoint @entity3 as £ 200,000 - a - year @entity4 the man who led @entity0 ’s campaign to be speaker has warned him he could lose his job over his controversial plan to give @entity11 ’s top job to an inexperienced @entity13 woman			1
senior conservative mp @entity14 told mr @entity0 he must give in to demands for mps to quiz @entity13 official @entity3 about allegations of misconduct before she is given the £ 200,000 - a - year job of @entity21			1
the move is a serious blow to mr @entity0 ’s hopes of surviving the row			2
mr @entity14 is a close personal and political ally of mr @entity0 and performed the traditional role of ‘ dragging ’ him to the speaker ’s chair when he was elected in 2009			2
the disclosure came as mr @entity0 launched a desperate attempt to save his career yesterday by promising to slash the powers of ms @entity33 – before she has even started work			2
he said he would split the @entity4 into two , with a clerk in charge of advising mps on constitutional and legal issues and a new chief executive role to take charge of parliamentary administration			0
it would pave the way for ms @entity33 to become commons chief executive – and keep her out of the @entity4 chamber			0
but senior mps said it was ‘ too little too late ’ , would saddle taxpayers with another six - figure salary – and vowed to carry on their campaign to defeat him and block ms @entity3			1
@entity54 mp @entity53 said : ‘ this is a grubby compromise to get the speaker out of a hole and it wo n’t wash			0
’ and @entity54 grandee @entity59 , who has led criticism of mr @entity0 over the issue , dismissed the job split plan , saying : ‘ it does not clear the way for ms @entity33 to be appointed clerk – it just adds to the confusion and concern			1
the appointment process should be stopped and must go back to the drawing board			0
’ mr @entity59 said if mr @entity0 refuses to back down , @entity72 should refuse to send ms @entity3 ’s appointment to @entity74 for the @entity76 ’s necessary approval			1
and mr @entity59 insisted his powerful public affairs @entity77 must have the right to interrogate ms @entity3 , who is involved in an investigation into ‘ spying ’ at the @entity82 in @entity83 where she is head of the @entity84			1
last week 's @entity85 reported on the row behind @entity0 's attempted parliamentary power grab her role , which includes responsibility for catering and cleaning , has led to her being dubbed the ‘ @entity83 caterer ’ by @entity95 wags			2
the row over her appointment intensified last night after claims that a warning was ignored about ‘ problems ’ in ms @entity3 ’s record in @entity13 was ignored by the committee of @entity38 – headed by @entity0 – that chose her			1
the warning is understood to have been flagged up in a report to mps by a firm of headhunters dealing with the appointment			0
but an attempt by one mp to ask the headhunters – @entity113 – for more details was brushed aside , a source said			0
he added : ‘ it was obvious there was something in her background that needed to be checked thoroughly			0
two members of the panel asked for the information but were told there was n’t time and it was n’t relevant			0
it would appear @entity0 had decided he wanted @entity3 and did not want to hear anything against her			1
@entity0 wanted to appoint @entity13 @entity3 , pictured to the £ 200,000 - a - year parliamentary post ‘ if the panel had asked for the details , they would have heard the full story over investigations into ms @entity3 at the @entity82 – and she would probably have been ruled out			1
’ mr @entity0 ’s critics say ms @entity3 is unfit to perform the @entity134 role because she has no experience of parliamentary procedure			1
some claim he wants to take advantage of her lack of qualifications to grab more power for himself			0
the speaker ’s credibility took another knock with reports that all three of his deputy speakers , @entity148 ’s @entity147 and @entity149 and @entity54 @entity150 , oppose ms @entity33 ’s appointment			0
last night @entity0 allies denied the headhunters ’ advice was ignored and insisted ms @entity33 herself had mentioned the two @entity82 inquiries .			2

@entity0 has been *threatened* with losing his job unless he backs down
@entity0 wants to appoint @entity13 @entity3 to a £ 200,000 - a - year post
@entity38 want to question ms @entity3 before she can become @entity21
