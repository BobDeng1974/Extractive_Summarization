a @entity1 academic has said conspiracy theories are built into @entity4 culture because the country was founded on them			1
professor sir @entity7 , of the @entity8 , is leading a project into conspiracy theories and is @entity1 's leading authority on the subject matter			1
speaking at the @entity13 yesterday , he said conspiracy theories are more common in the @entity4 compared with other countries			1
@entity17 gunman ? @entity18 , 24 , is shown after his arrest for the assassination of @entity21 in 1963 ' there is an argument that conspiracy theories are built into @entity4 culture because that is how @entity4 started			1
' the @entity4 was founded on conspiracy theories : the @entity28 government was conspiring to deprive @entity4 of their liberties			1
' mr @entity7 cited the @entity21 assassination , the 9/11 attacks and even campaigns which claim president @entity33 is not @entity4			1
he also believes the internet has not led to an increased belief in such theories			1
professor sir @entity7 is leading a project into conspiracy theories following the assassination of @entity21 in 1963 , most @entity4 believed @entity18 did not act alone			1
however , the number of people who believe this conspiracy theory now has decreased since the growth of the internet			1
mr @entity7 believes conspiracy theories normally form following a traumatic event			1
for example the @entity48 witch hunts took place following the @entity51			2
however , in recent years , many theories have been directed at governments			2
mr @entity7 said at the festival : ' in the late 19th century conspiracy theories were directed against big business and cartels			1
' this did not happen so much in the recent economic crisis where conspiracy theories have been targeted much more at government			1
' is it because governments play a much bigger role in our lives than they did a century ago ? ' research for the project will be published in 2017			2
mr @entity7 is a @entity69 , the @entity70 and the @entity71			1
he is also an honorary fellow of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity8 , and @entity76 , @entity28			2
he is also the editor of the @entity77			2
september 11 , 2011 - despite repeated claims by @entity79 that it planned the attacks on the @entity81 in @entity82 , several official and unofficial investigations into the collapse of the @entity81 suggest that structural failure was responsible			0
some theorists believe the @entity4 government had prior warning of the attacks but did not do enough to stop them			1
others believe the @entity93 administration deliberately turned a blind eye to warnings to launch wards in the @entity97			0
a large group of people who call themselves the @entity100 believe an aircraft did not hit the @entity102 and that the @entity81 could not have been brought down by an airliner impact and burning aviation fuel			0
they say there is also video evidence to suggest there were puffs of smoke coming from the @entity81 at levels far below the impact zones			0
many witnesses claim to have heard explosions before the aircraft impacts			0
some theorists believe the @entity4 government had prior warning of the 9/11 attacks the assassination of @entity21 - the 35th @entity119 was shot on friday , november 22 , 1963 , in @entity120 , @entity121 at 12.30pm			1
he was fatally wounded by gunshots while riding with his wife - @entity124 - in a motorcade			0
the ten - month investigation of the @entity129 of 1963 to 1964 , the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) of 1976 to 1979 , and other government investigations concluded that the president had been assassinated by @entity18 - who was himself shot dead by @entity131 while in police custody			0
however , there has always been doubts that @entity18 was the lone gunman who fired shots from the @entity136 which overlooked @entity137			0
footage taken by @entity139 on 8mm film supported the belief that at least four shots were fired and not three which the @entity129 claimed			2
there has always been doubts that @entity18 was the lone gunman who fired shots from the @entity136 it has also been suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction			0
many believe shots were fired by a gunman hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza			0
in 1979 the @entity126 ( @entity126 ) found both the original @entity155 investigation and the @entity156 to be seriously flawed			0
the @entity126 also concluded that there were at least four shots fired and that it was probable that a conspiracy existed			2
however , later studies , including one by the @entity160 , have called into question the accuracy of the evidence used by the @entity126 to support its finding of four shots			0
a flying saucer crashed at @entity166 in 1947 - what is certain is that something did crash at @entity166 , @entity170 , sometime before july 7 , 1947 and - at first - the @entity4 authorities stated explicitly that this was a flying saucer or disk			1
numerous witnesses reported seeing metallic debris scattered over a wide area and at least one reported seeing a blazing craft crossing the sky shortly before it crashed			0
in 1989 , former mortician @entity180 claimed that he was involved in alien autopsies which were carried out at the @entity166 air force base			0
some theorists believe autopsies were allegedly carried out on aliens who crashed in the @entity170 desert which was then covered up by @entity4 authorities weight has been added to the conspiracy theory due to the @entity4 military repeatedly changing its story			1
since the late 1990s , several former @entity193 researchers have concluded that the craft was , indeed , part of a @entity4 military project and that it was , most likely , some sort of weather balloon			1
however , @entity198 , the @entity199 public affairs officer , said he saw alien corpses and a craft which was involved in a military cover up			0
he died in @entity203 faked the moon landings - some theorists believe @entity207 astronauts did not land on the @entity208			0
they claim @entity209 and possibly others deceived the public into believing the landings			0
they have pointed to photographs from the lunar surface which they claim show camera crosshairs partially behind rocks , a flag planted by @entity219 moving in a strange way , the lack of stars over the lunar landscape and shadows falling in different directions			0
fake ? astronaut @entity219 , lunar module pilot , walks on the surface of the @entity208 in july 1969 the @entity229 conspiracy - the theory that launched the novel @entity231 and a film of the same name			2
theorists believe @entity229 married @entity235 , had one or more children , and that those children or their descendants emigrated to southern @entity239			0
once there , they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the merovingian dynasty , whose special claim to the throne of @entity239 is championed today by a secret society called the @entity247			0
theorists believe @entity229 married @entity235 , had one or more children , and that those children or their descendants emigrated to southern @entity239 @entity249 faked his own death - there has been a belief that @entity249 did not actually die in 1977			2
many even think he is still alive and that he went into hiding			0
two tabloid newspapers ran articles covering the continuing ' life ' of @entity249 after his death including a broken leg from a motorcycle accident , all the way up to his ' real death ' in the mid 1990s			0
there has been a belief that @entity249 did not actually die in 1977			2
many even think he went into hiding @entity265 - a conspiracy involving a plan by the @entity268 to launch a fake @entity270 terror campaign on @entity4 soil to persuade the @entity4 public to support an invasion against @entity274			1
the plan involved bombings and the simultaneous hijacking and blowing up of @entity4 airliners			1
the operation was quashed by president @entity21 leading many to speculate that it was linked to his assassination a year later			2
the plan has also been linked by theorists who believe that the september 11 , 2001 attacks were a so - called ' inside job ' because of the use of airliners			0
@entity285 - the @entity285 ( @entity285 ) is a theoretical regional union of @entity286 , @entity170 and the @entity4 similar in structure to the @entity288 , sometimes including a common currency called the amero			1
theorists who believe that the three countries are planning for this believe that it is part of a global conspiracy to set up something called the @entity297 ( @entity297 )			2
officials from all three nations have repeatedly denied that there are plans to create a @entity285			0
@entity302 was allowed to happen - @entity291 believe that president @entity303 provoked the @entity305 attack on the @entity4 naval base in @entity307 in december 1941 , knew about it in advance and covered up his failure to warn his fleet commanders			1
sailors at @entity313 watch as the destroyer @entity315 explodes after an attack by @entity305 carrier based strike aircraft on the @entity320 port of @entity302 december 7 , 1941 he apparently needed the attack to provoke @entity322 into declaring war on the @entity4 because the @entity4 public and @entity325 were overwhelmingly against entering the war in @entity327			1
theorists believe that the @entity4 was warned by the governments of @entity1 , the @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 and the @entity334 that a surprise attack on @entity302 was coming and that the @entity4 had intercepted and broken all the important @entity305 codes in the run up to the attack .			1
