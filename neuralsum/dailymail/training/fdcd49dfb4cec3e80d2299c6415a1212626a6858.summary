by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 19:19 est , 31 october 2013 traditional @entity2 alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications			1
the a * to @entity3 will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine , with nine being the highest , say exam watchdogs			0
other changes include an end to different papers for pupils based on ability , except in subjects where they are considered necessary			1
' i got a nine ! ' : traditional @entity2 alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications , which are being totally revamped exam regulator @entity20 will also confirm today that end - of - course exams are to become the ‘ default method of assessment ’ , killing off modular tests in most subjects			1
they will generally be sat in the summer , ending the @entity28 of pupils entered early or multiple times in the hope that they eventually score a good grade			0
the changes apply to @entity36 literature , @entity36 language and maths being taught from september 2015			0
other subjects will follow the year after			0
chief regulator @entity40 admitted the move would be ‘ challenging ’ but added : ‘ the changes will make sure they are better qualifications – better assessed and more resilient so that everyone can have greater confidence in the results			1
’ the reputation of @entity2 has collapsed amid concern about grade inflation , easy modular assessments , dumbed down content and endless retakes			0
the nine numerical grades – one more than the current alphabetic system – will provide a clear distinction between middle and higher grades , @entity20 said , and reduce ‘ bunching ’ around the @entity57 and @entity58 grades			1
the extra grade is also intended to ‘ signal that new gcses are new qualifications ’			1
however , making nine the highest grade will fuel speculation that there is room to add more in future – in a similar way that a star was added to a grades			0
mrs @entity40 insisted this was unlikely but refused to rule it out			0
she added : ‘ people will want to make comparisons between the new and old grading scales and to know which new grade is the same as an existing c grade , for example			1
’ it all rides on this : exam regulator @entity20 will also confirm today that end - of - course exams are to become the ' default method of assessment ' governments of all political stripes have spent almost 100 years tinkering with the exam system			1
from 1918 , 16 - year - olds sat the @entity89 , in which candidates had to pass maths , @entity36 and three other subjects			1
it was abolished in 1951 when o - levels were introduced			1
pass grades of @entity95 were developed for the predominantly exam - based qualification , although some boards used 1 - 6			1
fails were shown by a u grade or 7 - 9 respectively			2
from 1975 , all boards adopted the letter - based system			2
cses were available from 1965 for less able pupils , with a grade 1 the equivalent to a c at o - level			2
students last sat the exams in 1987 , and they were replaced the following year by gcses			2
the new qualifications made widespread use of coursework and controlled assessments and were graded a to @entity116 , with a @entity117 for fails			2
a * grades were first used in 1994 to show the highest level of achievement			0
but dumbing down and grade inflation under @entity123 led to many public schools ditching gcses in favour of alternatives such as @entity128 , which have an option to do no coursework			0
since the @entity132 came to power , attempts have been made to restore their reputation			0
grade inflation was suppressed and other changes included giving more marks for correct spelling , grammar and punctuation			0
plans are also under way to change the curriculum			0
both the @entity36 and maths exams are tiered at the moment , with foundation papers available for weaker pupils			2
in future , all candidates will sit the same exams in @entity36 literature and language , giving everyone the chance to achieve top grades			2
maths will remain tiered , however , reflecting a huge difference in ability among candidates			0
to avoid cherry - picking results , anyone who retakes a subject will have to sit all the exams again			1
only having end of year assessments could also help boys , who are outperformed by girls in almost every subject but are believed to perform better under exam conditions			2
but @entity170 , general secretary of the @entity171 , said the changes would be confusing to the public			1
@entity123 schools spokesman @entity174 said it was ‘ odd ’ that the @entity176 wanted more rigorous exams when they allowed unqualified teachers in some schools			0
and @entity181 , general secretary of the @entity183 teachers ’ union , claimed the reforms had been ‘ rushed through at breakneck speed , driven on by a political imperative , rather than the needs of pupils ’			0
pupils first sat gcses in 1988 , replacing the old two - tier assessment structure of o - levels and @entity193 .			1

changes will make clean break with current discredited qualifications
end - of - course exams to become ' default method of assessment '
@entity171 warns changes could cause confusion
