@entity1 coach @entity0 has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of saturday 's @entity5 against @entity6			1
recent comments from @entity9 boss @entity8 about the game being ' geared towards defences that inhibit attack ' have sparked debate around the sport 's marketability , with @entity0 predicting another war of attrition at the @entity18			1
asked if he expects a feast of running rugby , the 44 - year - old said : ' i 'm not too sure about that			2
there is a lot at stake			0
@entity6 are on course for a @entity26 and just to get away from @entity27 with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do			1
@entity1 coach @entity0 insists that winning rather than attractive rugby will be their main priority @entity32 ( right ) in action for @entity1 during the @entity35 match with @entity36 at the @entity36 @entity9 's @entity8 recently suggested that rugby is being geared towards a more defensive style ' with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second			1
that 's the nature of the game at the moment and that 's how teams are wearing each other down and , unfortunately , the spectators have got to pay a price for that			2
' wales have beaten @entity6 just twice in @entity27 over the last 32 years and @entity0 is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites			1
' they are on a bit of a roll at the moment — 10 wins on the bounce , ' said @entity0			1
' certainly from the outside it looks a very happy camp			0
this is quite a formidable @entity6 team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them			1
' all eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end the visitors ' @entity26 push and keep alive their own championship hopes			0
they have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from @entity76 and @entity77 , with scrum - half @entity78 promising not to repeat the mistakes that @entity81 made in @entity82 two weeks ago			0
' i do n't know if @entity81 did much analysis on them , ' said @entity78			0
' they did n't seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever			0
we need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error			0
' @entity36 's @entity94 ( centre ) fends off the challenges as he surges forward against @entity1 @entity97 runs with the ball for @entity1 as his side beat @entity36 20 - 13 in their last game @entity36 's @entity101 ( left ) is tackled as he makes a break during @entity104 ' defeat in their last game it promises to be an intense tactical battle between @entity107 and counterpart @entity108 , with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired @entity6 lock @entity110 during the week			1
@entity107 was said to have ' the intellectual properties of a tub of @entity113 ' , although @entity6 captain @entity114 holds the @entity115 in much higher regard			1
' for as long as i can remember we 've being trying to poach ideas from @entity107 , ' said @entity114			0
' we played @entity120 with @entity121 in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an @entity126 ( strength and conditioning ) and nutritional point of view			0
it was a rude awakening			0
he makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking			0
' at the start of the championship , @entity108 said the @entity1 - @entity81 game was going to be the standard - bearer			1
two years ago @entity6 beat ( @entity1 ) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against @entity81			1
' they 'll feel the same thing is happening now			0
' @entity1 boss @entity107 watches his players in training ahead of the showdown with @entity6 @entity6 coach @entity108 talks with fly - half @entity76 during ahead of saturday 's game with @entity1 a lot has changed since @entity114 played the first of his @entity147 more than 13 years ago			1
professionalism has been the key to the former shelf - stacker 's longevity , although he has not always been surrounded by such healthy company			2
on the week of his debut in 2002 — against @entity1 in @entity82 — the young and enthusiastic second - row had to share a room with former @entity121 team - mate @entity157			2
' i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning , ' recalled a laughing @entity114			0
' @entity162 ' used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up			0
i was well aware this was not the way forward			0
' obviously it 's changed a lot since then			2
now in @entity171 camp i take a lot of advice from ( strength and conditioning coach ) @entity174			2
@entity76 is obviously ( another ) great guy to copy and follow			0
' as the ball emerges from the ruck , @entity6 's @entity77 kicks it upfield during the match with @entity81 scrum - half @entity77 passes the ball down the line during @entity6 's 19 - 9 victory over @entity81 last time out @entity6 's @entity182 ( centre ) braves the challenges of @entity185 ( right ) and @entity186 @entity77 brings the ball forward once more against @entity81 at the @entity187 on march 1 kicking game in @entity77 and @entity76 , @entity6 have the world 's in - form kicking half - back combination			1
their aerial game - plan was predictable against @entity81 yet @entity194 did not have the players at his disposable to stop it			0
@entity1 , however , have one of the best defensive back - threes in the world and @entity198 is a master at limiting the space to kick into			1
how well @entity6 anticipate that — perhaps using @entity76 as a looping runner , if the wingers drop back — will be highly significant			2
set - piece at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , @entity203 of @entity1 and @entity204 of @entity6 are two of the tallest players in the competition			1
they are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line - out throw , while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents '			0
their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both @entity1 and @entity6 are particularly effective			1
picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal ; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of @entity217 and @entity114			0
breakdown @entity219 defence coach @entity218 claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area			2
however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against @entity6 , who won 23 turnovers to nine against @entity81 in round three			1
@entity107 's game - plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and @entity6 will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of @entity32 and @entity233			1
getting on the right side of referee @entity235 will be key , because @entity198 and @entity76 are two of the world 's leading goal - kickers .			2

wales take on @entity6 in the @entity35 at the @entity18
coach @entity0 says they will play ugly if they need to in order to win
@entity9 boss @entity8 recently *criticised* defensive play
@entity0 insists that winning will be @entity1 ' first priority on saturday
they face an *unbeaten* @entity6 side so far in this year 's *tournament*
