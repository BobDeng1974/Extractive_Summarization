while there was plenty to admire from our favourite male celebrities in 2014 , even our most esteemed hunks managed to let us down			1
from scalp landing strips and a gratuitous display of pectoral cleavage to slinging on a bedspread and calling it a scarf , a-list men provided much to look at - if not to applaud			1
now a national survey reveals the very worst crimes against fashion committed by some of the biggest names in music , acting , and reality tv			1
@entity22 's bizarre ' rat tail ' hair do this bizarre haircut was the clear winner of @entity25 of 2014			1
the 28 - year - old actor gave the world the first glimpse of his very unusual new ' do as he and girlfriend @entity29 headed back to their hotel in @entity32 in november			0
instead of the tousled vampire locks he is known for , @entity22 instead sported a monkish tonsure			0
was it punk ? was it fashion - forward ? no one knows , but perhaps the edgy style is influenced by his out - there new girlfriend			1
@entity29 - whose real name @entity29 - is known for her envelope - pushing look both on and off stage			0
however it is doubtful that @entity22 's legions of loyal fans , who came to love him as floppy haired @entity62 in the twilight saga , are as happy at his makeover			1
@entity65 , founder and ceo of menswear fashion website @entity68 , which conducted the survey , said : ' when @entity22 first showed off the " landing strip " haircut many people took to @entity73 to speculate if he 'd done it because he had lost a bet			2
' others thought it looked like an exclamation mark without the dot , or a goatee on the wrong side of this face â€“ but like just our survey the unanimous verdict was that this was a huge fashion fail			2
' @entity88 's @entity87 moob display while you have to give the rapper and designer credit for his courage and adventurous fashion sense , he often gets it wrong			1
while there were many options for his ultimate style fail of 2014 , the one voted for by @entity100 was his fine display of ' man boobs ' or ' moobs ' during @entity104			1
@entity88 's @entity106 show look contained many aspects including moobs , head stripes and knee-less jeans the rapper appeared with wife @entity112 at the front row of the @entity115 show in september			1
she wore a tuxedo jacket with nothing on underneath so @entity88 made sure they matched by unbuttoning his navy shirt to the navel			1
the result ? it was difficult to decide who had better cleavage @entity127 's leopard - print trousers and studded hat the 18 - year - old was seen sporting a pair of bright purple leopard - print trousers , a black jumper and a bright yellow hat complete with metal studs			1
the teen crooner was snapped wearing this inexplicable outfit as he left the swanky @entity137 in @entity138 after a night of partying which saw him visit several nightclubs across the capital before being joined by two young ladies at his hotel at 4.30am			0
@entity127 sported a pair of bright purple leopard print trousers and bright yellow hat complete with metal studs after such escapades , it is perhaps plausible that @entity127 rolled out of bed and headed to his car still in his nightwear and donned the unusual hat as a means to conceal his bed hair			0
over the course of 2014 @entity127 has done his best to shed his clean - cut image with drugs , arrests and a monkey - related scandal all ensuring the baby singer did n't stay out of the spotlight for long			2
alongside this transformation has come a change in his fashion , with @entity127 opting for a much more urban feel to his wardrobe			2
however this look may be taking his new found edginess just a tad too far			0
@entity172 's one - legged ' @entity171 ' when @entity174 star @entity172 walked out into the @entity176 june sunshine wearing his barely - there man pants , the whole world gaped in awe			1
how does it stay up ? is this legal in public ? what would borat say ? pictures of the asymmetric ' swimsuit ' went viral , with celebrities such as @entity186 and @entity187 even tweeting about the daring summer look			0
@entity172 wore the one legged ' man sling ' while on holiday with the @entity174 cast in @entity176 there is almost nothing good to say about @entity172 's decision to wear a red sling in lieu of swimming trunks , an option that provided the least possible amount of cloth cover without making him liable for prosecution for exposing himself in public			2
explaining his one legged budgie - smuggler @entity172 said that it avoided ' unsightly white bits ' while tanning			0
he even appeared on @entity210 's @entity209 to try and sell his very own range of the tiny swimwear			2
@entity65 said clearly @entity172 was trying to shock with his particularly revealing choice of swimwear			0
@entity216 's all - tartan suit known for his long hair and lothario ways on @entity221 's made in @entity220 , @entity216 , who goes mainly by his surname , usually wears a casual combination of tight trousers and t - shirt			2
@entity216 was joined by his stylish co-star @entity216 at a @entity226 fashion show in february however clearly feeling he had to smarten up for the @entity226 autumn / winter 2014 catwalk show in february , @entity216 opted for head - to - toe tartan			1
he may have thought he looked jazzy , but the overall appearance was closer to picnic blanket than high fashion			2
the t - shirt designer accessorised the @entity234 tailor - made tartan suit with a plain white shirt and gold medallion on a chain			0
@entity238 wore a shocking pink velour tracksuit for a trip to @entity241 in may @entity243 's pink velour tracksuit another popular fashion fail was @entity247 boy @entity243 's fuchsia all - in - one outfit			1
it was a rare style mistake from @entity249 finalist and reality tv star @entity238 as the usually dapper 27 - year - old wore a shocking pink velour tracksuit for a trip to @entity241 in may			1
to make matters worse he teamed the sportswear with a pair of bright white trainers , allowing for a glimpse of ankle between the elasticated trousers and shoes			0
engaged to the stylish @entity263 , @entity238 generally fares well in the style stakes , which makes this faux pas all the more upsetting			1
@entity266 and @entity268 's outlandish accessories how did two of the most fashionable and desired men in the music business manage to get it so wrong			2
wearing perfectly normal outfits , both @entity266 and rock star @entity268 suceeded in landing themselves on the worst fashion fail list through their accessories alone			1
despite being indoors - and in @entity279 - @entity266 plonked a giant fur raccoon hat on his head for the @entity283 awards show			0
as well as being totally out of place when not worn by a mountaineer up a snowy peak , the presence of a furry tail hanging down the singer 's neck was nothing short of creepy			1
similarly , @entity268 managed to ruin his normal get - up of shirt , jumper , jacket and jeans with a massive scarf			0
more blanket than winter warmer , the knitted monstrosity looked in danger of suffocating the rocker as he walked			0
long enough to comfortably cover a sofa , the brown scarf hung down nearly to the singer 's waist and even @entity268 's legendary swag could n't make it look good			0
@entity266 ( left ) and @entity268 ( right ) prove that accessories can ruin an outfit even on the best looking men @entity312 ' cropped tux musician @entity312 made it on to the list with his black tie shorts look which he wore to the @entity317			0
a true gentleman 's classic , the tuxedo is not to be messed with , and while the happy singer can pull off many wacky looks ( most famously of course his mountie hat ) , the cropped tux trousers he wore to the @entity317 led many to question if there had been an accident at the dry - cleaners			0
standing at a modest 5ft 7in , the knee - length leg - wear did nothing to lengthen the star , who looked positively diminutive next to his statuesque wife @entity330			0
@entity312 may have written @entity331 , the song of 2014 , but his cropped tuxedo failed to win fans			0

twilight star 's *shaved* head and rat tail voted top fashion crime of 2014
@entity243 takes second place in shocking pink velour tracksuit
other faux pas include @entity88 's exposed pectoral cleavage
