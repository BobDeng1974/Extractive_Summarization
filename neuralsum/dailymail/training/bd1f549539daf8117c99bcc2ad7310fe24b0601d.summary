by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:42 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 26 december 2013 comedy : @entity4 attracts celebrities including @entity7 actor @entity6 and @entity8 @entity9 has revealed that it is selling its shares in tobacco , arms and alcohol companies following an expose of its unethical investment practices			0
in a dramatic u-turn following weeks of refusal to change what it does with its funds , the charity has agreed to withdraw millions of pounds from controversial ‘ booze , bombs and fags ’ funds while an ‘ urgent review ’ of its policies is carried out			2
the temporary block comes as staff try to deal with the huge public backlash caused by the revelations that @entity9 pumps donations into the companies even as it backs projects to help victims of war , alcohol abuse and smoking - related illnesses			2
despite initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments would generate a smaller return , @entity9 has now agreed to submit itself to an eight - week inquiry into its investment policies			1
the embarrassing turnaround was announced in a low - key press release on its website on monday			1
its chair @entity47 – who also heads the @entity50 ’s commercial arm @entity51 – said : ‘ as a charity which depends on public trust , it ’s absolutely right that we take this opportunity to examine our investment policy thoroughly in view of the concerns which have been raised			1
’ @entity9 ’s trustees said the review panel would consist of two independent members , mr @entity47 and three @entity9 trustees			0
the meetings will be attended by four weddings and a funeral director @entity66 – who co-founded the charity with comedian @entity68 in 1985 – and its £ 131,000 - a - year chief executive @entity69			1
the statement read : ‘ until the review has been concluded , the trustees have decided to withdraw @entity9 funds from the sections of the investment portfolio which have caused concern , and this process is underway			2
funny business : the charity co-founded by @entity68 , centre , has celebrated its 25th anniversary ‘ @entity9 is committed to finding a solution that allows it to continue to deliver the greatest benefit to the poor and vulnerable people it supports			1
’ in its initial response to the scandal – exposed by the @entity50 ’s @entity89 programme earlier this month – @entity9 took a very different tone			1
at the time , a spokesman said : ‘ because the range of issues we support is so broad , ethical screening would significantly limit our ability to invest as well as seriously increase financial risk			0
‘ we do not invest directly in any individual company			0
we believe this approach has delivered the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people			0
’ but after the programme prompted a huge online backlash from members of the public who felt their donations had been misused , mr @entity69 appeared to backtrack and promised he would ‘ do the right thing ’			0
this year ’s @entity4 raised more than £ 100million after an eight - hour show on @entity110 and @entity111 , fronted by presenters including @entity68 , @entity113 , @entity114 and featuring skits by @entity68 ’s ex-wife @entity8 and @entity7 actor @entity6			0
funny for money : @entity9 happens every two years and raises more than £ 100 million each time arms : the investments included the weapons manufacturer @entity121 , pictured but some of the charity ’s own stars – including comics @entity125 and @entity127 – have since distanced themselves from its activities , trading jokes about @entity9 ’s connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer @entity121 and @entity133			1
according to @entity9 ’s accounts from 2007 to 2009 , it placed millions in ‘ blue - chip ’ city funds that in turn invested in the firms , including £ 2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009			2
it is currently sitting on a £ 100million fund donated by the public despite promising to hand ‘ every pound ’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts .			0
