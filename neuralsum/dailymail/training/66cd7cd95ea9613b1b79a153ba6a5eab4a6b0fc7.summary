three @entity1 shrines that may have been used to predict the future have been discovered in a hilltop fortress at @entity4 , @entity5			1
each of the 3,300 - year - old shrines is made up of a single room holding a clay bowl filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts			2
researchers suspect that , as part of an ancient ritual , local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances			0
three @entity1 shrines that may have been used to predict the future have been discovered in a hilltop fortress at @entity4 , @entity5			1
the basin of the east citadel shrine is seen in this image			0
in the three shrines archaeologists found evidence that animal bones , stone and flour ' our best evidence of this comes from pollen washes , ' professor @entity30 from @entity31 told @entity36			1
' we take the pottery and wash with distilled water			2
we then capture the run off			0
from this we found residues of grape , and something similar to @entity44 which is a stimulant			1
' the shrine artefacts include clay idols , animal bones , stamp seals and containers used to burn substances , according to a report by @entity53 in @entity54			0
archaeologists at @entity31 believe local rules used the knucklebones of cows , sheep and goat as a type of dice to predict the future			1
these bones were marked with burns and other engravings , and were small enough to roll			0
in one shrine , researchers found 18 pebbles			2
' these stones appear to have been selected for their smooth , rounded shape and their colour palette , which ranged from black and dark grey to white , green and red , ' writes professor @entity30 , lead author of the study at @entity31			0

the altar and basin of a shrine ( the large , fractured block ) excavated on the fortress ' east citadel can be seen in these two images researchers suspect that , as part of an ancient ritual , local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances			0
pictured is one of the shrines on the left is a clay idol with hornlike protrusions , while the right image shows what is considered another idol but how exactly these unmarked stones would have been used in rituals is unknown			2
professor @entity30 suspects they may have been used in the same way as the knuckle bones			0
another shrine contained vessels used to grind flour			2
it may have been used to predict the future in a ritual called aleuromancy			1
the @entity1 in the @entity118 can be divided into two parts - the @entity1 from around 2,500 to @entity120 , and the @entity1 from 1500 down to 900 bc. the earlier part is famous for its rich burials from localised cultures			1
in the later @entity1 a far more homogenous culture came into being			1
the @entity1 also saw an increase in the number of hillforts sites			1
these had begun in the @entity1 and reached their peak in the early @entity129			1
@entity130 was a practice in which messages would be baked inside of cakes or cookies , which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told			2
' what is conspicuous about the grinding installation in the east citadel shrine is the lack of a formal oven for bread baking , ' professor @entity30 writes			0
the shrine 's basin ' was clearly used for burning materials and certainly could have been used to bake small balls of dough , but it is unlikely that it would have been used to cook loaves of bread			0
' the stamps may have been used to seal messages within the dough			0
during the time these shrines were active , a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of @entity5 , and so there are no written records of its local rulers			1
the shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict			1
the group that controlled @entity4 was likely wiped out as a result			1
' it does n't appear to have been reoccupied , ' said professor @entity30			0
' it was probably attacked by one of its neighbours ... but these practices probably went on in neighboring areas			0
' we 're now trying to figure out what exactly happened to these ancient people			0
' archaeologists found two funnels ( @entity181 ) ) that were used to burn substances at the shrine site @entity185 and e show stamp seals that could have been used to stamp images on pieces of dough before they were used for divination			2
this would have been the @entity1 version of a fortune cookie @entity4 , where the three ancient shrines were uncovered , is a town in the @entity196 of @entity5 the shrines were found close together at @entity4			1
workshops dedicated to metal , bone and stone tool production were also found in this region			2

three @entity1 shrines were recently found in @entity4 , @entity5
pottery had *traces* of grape and substance similar to stimulant @entity44
the shrines also contained the @entity1 version of fortune cookies
knuckles from sheep and cows were used a dice to predict the future
shrines were used for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict
