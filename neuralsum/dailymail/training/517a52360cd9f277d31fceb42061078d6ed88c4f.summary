by @entity0 , political reporter published : 18:30 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 22 july 2013 competitive sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives , mps have warned			1
safeguarding @entity10 ’s @entity9 legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities , they say in a report out today			1
the @entity16 warned that competitive team sports have a ‘ limited appeal ’ to some children and politicians ’ focus on them can be ‘ counter-productive ’			1
' limited appeal ' : while children may look up to sporting heroes such as @entity26 winner @entity25 ( pictured ) mps warn that a focus on winning is sure to put some children off exercise number one : as @entity33 celebrate the euphoria of trouncing @entity35 in the @entity36 , mps publish a report saying shifting the focus from competitive to non-competitive sports will help tackle obesity during the @entity42 last summer @entity41 announced that competitive team sports would be made compulsory for all primary school children in @entity33			1
he pledged funding for new sports teachers to inspire the next generation of top athletes , and expressed concerns that @entity50 dance was being counted as physical education			0

the committee chairman , @entity63 mp @entity61 , said the @entity42 was a ‘ magical time ’ which generated ‘ massive enthusiasm ’ for sport among young people			0
@entity9 legacy : @entity41 ( pictured with @entity9 sailor @entity69 and @entity71 swimmer @entity70 ) had promised that competitive sports would become compulsory in primary schools ‘ high - quality school sport is vitally important , ’ he said			1
‘ it provides young people with opportunities to improve their education , health and well - being			0
' we need to be encouraging all young people to take part in sport ; whether they enjoy the competition of football , rugby or netball or prefer non-competitive activities			2
schools must provide a range of activities that appeal to all			2
’ competitive sports ‘ can bring many benefits to young people in terms of resilience , organisation and team work ’ , the report said , but a focus on winning ‘ can be a disincentive as a much as incentive ’ for some children			1
while the government has injected £ 300million into primary school sports provision for the next two years , the @entity53 warned there is no long - term plan when that ends in 2015			2
they said ministers needed to act to make sure the momentum was not lost ‘ amid short - term plans and funding ’ or their promises risked becoming a ‘ gimmick ’			0
inclusive : @entity53 say that safeguarding @entity10 's @entity9 legacy means getting as many children as possible to engage with exercise rather than focusing on coming first the committee took evidence from education think tanks , as well as the @entity119 and the @entity120 , which recommended more provision for non-competitive sport – although 59 per cent of primary schools said they offer this in the form of activities such as dance			1

all 17,000 primary schools in @entity33 and @entity133 have been given funding to improve their sports provision until 2015 , and around 120 dedicated sports teachers are being trained			0
mr @entity61 said : ‘ we are concerned that the government ’s primary sport premium – while correctly focused – is only being given to schools for two years			0
‘ this is simply not long enough for schools to build sustained provision ... if the funding is not extended , there is a risk the primary sport premium will become little more than a gimmick			0
