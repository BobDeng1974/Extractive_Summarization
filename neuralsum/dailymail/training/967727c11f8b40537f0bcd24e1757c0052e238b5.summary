by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 president @entity1 has been ordered to repay some of the £ 12.9million of taxpayer 's money spent on so - called ' security measures ' at his private home after it emerged they included a swimming pool , amphitheatre and tuckshop			1
an official report entitled ' @entity13 on a grand scale ' found @entity1 had derived ' substantial ' personal gain from improvements to his private compound at @entity18 in the rolling hills of @entity20			1
they reportedly include a visitors ' centre , cattle enclosure , marquee area , football pitch , helipad , medical clinic , extensive paving and new houses for the polygamist president 's large family			1
@entity1 has been ordered to pay back some of the £ 12.9 million of public money spent on his private home after it emerged so - called ' security measures ' included a swimming pool , football pitch and tuckshop the leaked findings of public protector @entity40 's investigation will reinforce a perception of runaway corruption under @entity1 and could hurt him and the ruling @entity44 ( @entity44 ) in an election due in six months			1
@entity1 's spokesman declined to comment , while @entity40 's office said the leak was ' unethical and unlawful '			0
the @entity44 threw its weight behind @entity1 , saying it believed he had done nothing wrong			0
gain : @entity2 president @entity1 the government went to court this month to try to prevent @entity40 from releasing the outcome of her investigation , arguing that cabinet ministers needed more time to work out whether its findings could jeopardise @entity1 's security			1
it dropped its challenge after @entity40 , a quietly spoken lawyer seemingly unfazed by the pressure of her role , said she had gone to great lengths to ensure the report posed no threat			0
the @entity66 newspapers said @entity40 's report accused @entity1 , a polygamous @entity68 traditionalist whose five years in office have been littered with scandals over violating ethics codes by failing to protect state resources and misleading parliament			2
@entity1 told parliament last year all the buildings in the sprawling compound had been built ' by ourselves as family and not by the government '			2
opposition parties seized on this particular aspect of the report to attack @entity1 , who became president in 2009 only after corruption charges against him were withdrawn on a technicality			2
prominent social campaigner @entity86 launched an online petition for him to be impeached and the opposition @entity88 ( @entity88 ) called for no - confidence vote in parliament , even though @entity1 is shielded by the @entity44 's nearly two - thirds majority			0
the report also found some of the more legitimate security features , such as 20 houses for police protection , a clinic and two helipads , were excessive and should have been placed in a nearby town to benefit the broader community , the paper said			0
the paper estimated some of the questionable features of the upgrade at 20 million rand ( $ 2 million )			0
it also said @entity1 had had his private architect drafted in as ' principal agent ' to oversee the upgrade , even though he was not a security expert			0
anger : the government ¿ s decision to spend over £ 12.4 million ( $ 20 million ) of taxpayer money to revamp @entity115 s private property has sparked public anger defiant : @entity2 media have defied a government warning and splashed pictures of president @entity1 's private home which was controversially revamped using taxpayers ' money the 215 million rand spent on @entity1 's home is in stark contrast to state money spent on improving the security of previous @entity2 presidents , the @entity66 and @entity125 said			1
@entity131 , @entity2 's last white president , who left office in 1994 , received 236,000 rand for upgrades to his house , while 32 million rand was spent on @entity136 's home			0
the @entity18 saga has been rich fodder for @entity2 's newspapers , especially since the government invoked apartheid - era security laws to declare the compound a ' national key point ' and prevent photographs of it from being published			0
when state security minister @entity147 reminded the media of the laws at a news conference this month , newspapers responded by splashing photos of the complex across their front pages beneath headlines such as ' so , arrest us ' and ' look away ! ' there are now at least 20 buildings on estate , including a number of large family homes , a medical clinic , swimming pool , football pitch , secure underground living quarters , tuck shop , helipad and visitors centre			1
how the other half live : the spending sparked public anger amid an economic crunch in a country where 10 million people live on social grants and many have only tin shacks for their homes @entity178 photographs of the lush site show an entire hamlet of large , modern buildings behind a huge security fence in rolling countryside			1
the spending revelations have prompted widespread public anger within @entity2 and claims of corruption			2
many @entity2 are incensed at the prospect that their 70 - year - old president - who already has three official state residences - might be using taxpayer 's money for private gain			2
there are also long running concerns about the financial burden placed on the public purse by the polygamous president 's four wives and estimated 20 children			1
speaking on thursday morning minister @entity147 cited a law first introduced during the apartheid period to argue that @entity1 's private home is a ' @entity205 ' which should not be photographed for security reasons .			0
