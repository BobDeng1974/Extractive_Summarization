there will be two teams in @entity2 on sunday but @entity3 plans to inspire @entity5 ’s players with his tale of the day there was only one , and how it triggered his move to the @entity11 and three encounters with the @entity13			1
it is 18 years since the farcical @entity16 qualifier that never was against @entity17 and @entity3 is back in the @entity19 capital			1
he works among other things as goalkeeper coach for the team which faces @entity24 in the @entity25 and believes this can be the campaign when his country reaches its first major finals as an independent nation			1
@entity5 coach @entity3 , pictured during his playing days for @entity33 , is looking forward to facing @entity24 @entity24 's players including ( from left to right ) @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 will be looking for a third straight @entity39 qualifying win in a row on sunday @entity5 lost their last qualifier to @entity42 , courtesy of @entity45 's low header ( pictured ) but before they step out to face @entity52 ’s team of @entity11 stars , the former @entity47 , @entity33 , @entity48 and @entity49 goalkeeper will remind them to seize the moment and trust in fate as he did when @entity5 replayed that game against the @entity58			1
‘ it was all very bizarre , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ that ’s how i came about my chance and you never know if we had played the original game if that chance would have come			1
that ’s how life goes			0
you have to take chances when you get them			0
‘ i will say the same thing when our lads go out against @entity24			1
this is a great chance			2
go out and make a name for yourselves			0
’ it was october 1996 and the story begins with @entity17 complaining about the lights after a training session on the eve of the game			1
‘ we were playing in our old stadium and the temporary floodlights had been brought in from @entity79 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ @entity17 started to complain but we never believed they would change the kick - off time on the day of the game			1
@entity35 slots home @entity24 's second goal against @entity85 from the penalty spot ‘ we got up and trained in the morning			1
then we heard the kick - off had been brought forward to 3pm			2
but no - one could believe it was possible			2
we were at out training camp ( 60 miles from the city ) and all the kit was there			0
we stuck to the original plan and went to the stadium for a kick off at 6.45pm			0
‘ it was a mistake by @entity96			0
we were a new nation and they thought they could do what they wanted with us			0
at first @entity17 thought they had won			1
but common sense appeared and they made us replay			0
’ when @entity17 took to the field and kicked off alone at 3pm , the @entity106 sang : ‘ there ’s only one team in @entity2 ’			1
initially , there were reports that @entity113 ’s team would be awarded a 3 - 0 win , but @entity5 fought their corner and won the right to a replay			1
it was played four months later , in @entity119 , by which time @entity47 manager @entity120 was searching a new goalkeeper			1
@entity120 had signed @entity3 once before and called his old mate @entity123 , then @entity17 ’s goalkeeping coach , to run the rule over him again			1
‘ i first signed for @entity125 in ’ 94 when @entity120 was the manager , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ i came in from @entity126 in the @entity128 first division and it was a big jump for me			0
there were very few foreigners in @entity133 football at the time			0
@entity125 were in the @entity134 and a few eyebrows were raised when an @entity19 goalkeeper arrived			0
‘ i could n’t push @entity137 from the no 1 spot and @entity5 was n’t @entity139 at the time			2
my work permit was n’t renewed and i returned to @entity5 in ’ 96 but @entity120 kept an eye on me			2
’ poom clutches the ball during @entity5 's replay with @entity17 during the @entity147 qualifiers @entity3 , pictured in action against @entity149 , earned a move to @entity47 after his display against @entity17 poom performed well in a goalless draw in front of fewer than 4,000 in @entity119 and @entity123 ’s report sparked the move to @entity47			1
he made his debut at @entity149 in the same game as @entity158 , who stole the show with a solo wonder - goal , stayed for six years and brought @entity161 to its feet when he scored the only goal of his career - a fabulous header - when he returned with @entity33			0
‘ that was a special moment , because of the circumstances , ’ said @entity3			2
‘ when i left @entity47 i did n’t really have chance to say goodbye and on my first time back i scored an equaliser for @entity33 in the last minute			1
@entity17 's @entity171 is denied by @entity3 in the game that earned the goalkeeper a chance with @entity47 ‘ i did n’t really celebrate but it was a great feeling			1
the goal was one thing but the reception after the final whistle was something else			0
i got a standing ovation from both sets of fans			0
i had a special relationship with the club			0
‘ my best years were probably at @entity47 and of course i am really honoured to be able to say i met @entity187 three times			2
we exchanged a few pleasantries			0
she asked how long i ’d been in @entity24			2
’ poom first met the @entity13 when she opened @entity161 and again when she was on her @entity194 tour of @entity195 and he was one of the players selected to meet her when she was in @entity198			0
the third time was when the @entity48 players went to @entity201			0
the @entity13 had missed an appointment to open the @entity203 because of a bad back so she invited @entity206 ’s squad to the @entity201 a few months later			0
during two years at @entity48 he also pocketed a @entity208 runners - up medal			0
he was in the squad as cover and did not play but it was a nice souvenir as reward for putting @entity5 on the map , at least as far as @entity133 football fans were concerned			1
he was in goal , eight years ago , when @entity24 were last in @entity2			1
‘ beaten by @entity219 ’s crossing , ’ recalled the 42 - year - old , drily , when asked about the 3 - 0 defeat			1
it was the same score in the return at @entity222 four months later			0
poom went on to play for @entity33 ( pictured ) , @entity49 and @entity48 during his time in @entity24 @entity3 runs a coaching school in the city these days and works in the @entity19 @entity228 ’s coach education programme but will be on the touchline tomorrow , part of @entity232 ’s coaching team as they try to recover from defeat in @entity42 on thursday			1
‘ we saw the most important game as the one against @entity42 but everyone is up for @entity24 , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ the nation is looking forward to it			0
tickets sold out very quickly			0
it ’s not a big stadium , about a 10,000 capacity but people are close to the pitch and it will be a great atmosphere , like the older grounds in @entity24			2
‘ our only chance is to stick to the game - plan , be disciplined and really fight			2
we have spirit and the new qualifying format is better for smaller nations like @entity5			2
players and fans all have higher expectations			0
in the last euros we were close			0
we got to the play - offs and lost to @entity256			2

@entity3 impressed during a 0 - 0 draw with @entity17 in 1997
the match was a replay after @entity17 had *refused* to play the original *fixture*
his *performance* earned him a move to @entity11 side @entity47
now a coach for @entity5 , the former goalkeeper will tell his country 's players to take their chance against @entity24 on sunday
@entity52 's side visit @entity2 for their third @entity39 qualifier
