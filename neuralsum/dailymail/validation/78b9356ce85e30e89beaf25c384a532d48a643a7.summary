@entity0 says her mum 's favourite @entity2 present was a gadget she said she did n't want i can vividly remember the @entity2 when i bought my mum the one gift she had expressly forbidden me to buy			2
it was @entity10 : a way to record favourite tv shows , which at the time was novel and new to the market and something i was sure she could use			2
she was adamant about not wanting it and not watching enough tv for it to be useful			2
even so , i persevered knowing that many of her favourite cooking shows , home design programmes and @entity25 recording all by themselves would be something she would quickly learn to love			2
i also suspected that her reticence had to do with her own unspoken fear that she would n’t be able to master a complicated remote control			2
despite her protestations , i bought it anyway , and almost immediately it became one of her favourite gifts of all time			2
so whether it ’s something she ’s intimidated by , technology she is n’t familiar with , a beauty treatment she finds too extravagant or does n’t think she needs – or if you ’re just tired of giving her the same @entity47 mug with flowers every year , here are the top 15 gifts you should buy for your mum this @entity2 , that she does n’t know she wants ( yet )			1
