@entity0 faced fury from jewish community leaders today after he formed a pact with a @entity5 mep whose party leader has been accused of denying the @entity7 to get @entity9 funding			1
the @entity10 said it was ' gravely concerned ' by @entity12 's deal to accept a member of the @entity5 @entity14 ( @entity14 ) into its grouping in the @entity16			1
@entity18 's decision to join the @entity19 ( @entity20 of @entity21 and @entity22 ) group headed by mr @entity0 means it has enough members to increase its funding and standing in the parliament			1
@entity12 leader @entity0 has come under pressure after his party was joined in an @entity9 grouping by @entity18 but mr @entity18 has been criticised for joking about hitting women and his party 's leader has questioned whether @entity33 knew about the @entity7 and suggested women are less intelligent and should not vote			1
today @entity10 vice president @entity35 said the @entity14 should be ' roundly rejected ' and described mr @entity0 's welcoming of mr @entity18 in order to get money as ' beyond belief '			1
he said : ' @entity18 belongs to an extremist party whose leader has a history of @entity7 denial , racist remarks and misogynistic comments			1
' extremists and racists should be roundly rejected , not embraced			0
even @entity48 's far right @entity47 rejected the ( @entity14 ) as being too extreme			2
' for @entity12 to choose such a figure as @entity18 as a bedfellow , apparently for money , is beyond belief			1
' @entity0 now has some very serious questions to answer			1
he has placed in issue the credibility of @entity12			0
' but mr @entity0 said his party needed to do deals to make sure its voice was heard and insisted he would not work with extremists			1
' i have found nothing in this guy 's background to suggest he is a political extremist at all			2
he has joined our group to save us , ' he told @entity67 's @entity68			1
' all of us in the @entity16 have to make compromises to make sure that our voice is heard			0
i want us to have our voice , i want us to have a group , but i will not do it at any price			0
' if it came to a decision that do we cast @entity12 into the outer darkness of a non-attached group here or do a deal with a known prominent extremist in @entity20 , i would not do that deal			2
' asked about the @entity4 's reported comment that there were ' quite a few wives around who 'd be brought back down to earth ' if their husbands hit them , mr @entity0 , said : ' i think that comment was a joke '			1
but he added : ' i 've never met him , i 've never spoken to him			2
' as the row erupted , mr @entity0 insisted he had never met or spoken to mr @entity18 @entity14 leader @entity91 has been described as one of the most controversial figures in @entity5 politics , but @entity12 emphasised that mr @entity18 was joining the group in a personal capacity			1
the @entity19 was thrown into disarray last week when one its members , a @entity99 @entity4 , quit			2
groupings need to have at least 25 meps from seven different countries			0
if the group had disbanded it would have meant a loss to @entity12 of about 2million euros a year in funding for its meps and mr @entity0 would have got less speaking time in the parliament			1
@entity110 mp , @entity111 's shadow minister for the @entity112 , said : ' here are @entity12 forming an alliance with a far - right party in @entity20 that denies the fact that millions were murdered in the @entity7 , in order to keep receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds from the @entity16			0
' this shows once again that @entity12 do not share the values of decent working people in @entity121			0
' however rabbi @entity122 , a former @entity4 candidate , said : ' @entity18 was the only @entity5 member asked to join the @entity124			2
the only comment he made on @entity33 was that he was an evil man who should have been executed			0
' @entity126 is not a member of the @entity128			0
' both @entity129 and @entity124 abhors and rejects any scent of @entity131			0
as a @entity134 rabbi , i was number four on the @entity136 candidate list , and i can assure you in my many years in @entity12 i have never once experienced any anti-semitism			0
' all groups in the @entity16 have very odd bedfellows , for examples , the @entity142 are part of a pan @entity20 party @entity145 with @entity148 @entity147 of @entity149 , @entity111 are in a group with homophobes from @entity152			0
the @entity153 were recently led by @entity4 @entity154 with very odd views on child sexuality			0
' the rules to get @entity124 speaking time and funding are set by the @entity16 , not by @entity12			0

@entity18 's has joined @entity161 led by @entity0
move means it has enough members to increase funding and standing
@entity10 said it was ' gravely concerned ' by deal
@entity0 forced to insist he has never met or spoken to @entity18
