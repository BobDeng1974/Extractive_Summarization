a schoolboy has landed a catch of a lifetime - a monstrous 8ft catfish weighing the same as a champion boxer			2
the carnivorous catfish had snatched the live bait from 14 - year - old @entity8 's line who was on a fishing holiday in @entity11 with his father @entity12			1
weighing in at 208lb , similar to that of boxing champion @entity15 , it was never going to be an easy battle to pull him in			1
the giant catfish , which weighs a staggering 208lb and is 2.6 metres long , dwarfs @entity8 after he caught the monster on a fishing holiday in @entity11 the giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream , but @entity8 , from @entity21 , hung on			1
and finally , after a 35 minute battle , @entity8 finally landed the 15 stone , 2.5 metre - long fish			1
in time honoured tradition , he then posed for the traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
his father @entity12 : ' @entity8 certainly hit the jackpot with that monster ! he was exhausted but ecstatic after the fish was eventually landed , weighed and photographed			2
it was safely returned to the river and swam away in good health			0
' @entity8 fought for more than half an hour to land the fish after it snatched the live bait on the end of his line but was eventually able to catch it and pose for a traditional photo @entity8 , who attends @entity45 , has loved fishing for years and his latest catch is the biggest yet			1
he landed a 133lb catfish on the same stretch of river during a holiday last year and never expected to beat that			0

@entity12 , who hooked a rare albino catfish weighing 116lb , said they had ' an amazing few days ' fishing			0
' this was his third trip to the @entity30 in search of giant catfish			0
' the big one took 35 minutes to land and @entity8 had to be taken out in a boat by the guide from the swim to play and land it as it stripped 100m of line on its first big run			2
@entity8 did brilliantly to land it			2
' earlier this year an eight foot 260lb @entity71 catfish was caught in @entity73 by angler @entity74 on the @entity76 in @entity73			0
but the @entity78 catch to beat is the @entity79 of 297lbs , 9 oz. but the biggest on record is the @entity82 catfish , found in @entity83 , which was recorded as 8ft 9in long and just a sliver under 646 pounds .			0
