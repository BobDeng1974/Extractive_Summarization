former @entity1 singer @entity0 has found himself at the center of an alleged mistaken identity scandal police who thought they had arrested former @entity1 singer @entity0 have been left with egg on their faces - after it was revealed they had in fact been duped by a bold lookalike			1
a man who was arrested for burglary and drug possession on july 26 managed to convince cops he was the famous rocker for a month - and the truth only came out after the real deal posted a video of himself in the recording studio on his @entity20 page			1
the @entity21 even went so far as to give gossip website @entity23 a release stating that they had the 46 - year - old singer in custody , and it was the resulting story that led @entity0 to prove the only place he was locked up was in the studio			1
the written statement , titled ' celebrity arrest ' , read : ' the suspect , former @entity1 band member @entity0 ( 46 years of age ) , was taken into custody for burglary and possession of a controlled substance			1
' the department confirmed last night through analysing fingerprints that the man was in fact a 44 - year - old man named @entity42 , who is believed to bear an uncanny residence to @entity0			1
' it 's a lie , ' said @entity0 in the video , as he sat flanked by backup singers the @entity47			2
' i 've actually been touring , writing and recording my new album			0
' @entity0 's imposter was arrested for stealing razors from a @entity53 in @entity54 , and was also charged with felony possession of a controlled substance when police found methamphetamine on him			1
the charge was upped to burglary from simple theft because @entity42 allegedly carried an insulated bag that would n't set off sensors , indicating the act was premeditated			2
he gave police the name and birth date of his famous lookalike , which resulted in @entity23 reporting that @entity0 had been in jail for the last four weeks , with the bail set to $ 95,000			1
after being found out , police said @entity42 could now also face charges of giving false information to officers			2
back in day : @entity0 was fired from the @entity1 last year by his band mates for breach of contract and using the group 's name to promote his solo career @entity0 has faced legal troubles in the past , mostly drug - and alcohol - related , and has been in - and - out of rehab over the years			2
but he told @entity96 reporter @entity95 early last month that he has overcome his ' demons			0
' ' past demons are past demons ; that 's stuff that i dealt with 14 years ago , ' he said			0
' i mean , i guess @entity102 gets asked about [ his past drug use ] , so why should n't i ? but it 's not something that i think about , ever			0
those days of my dope abuse , and use , are long since by me			0
' in 2013 , he was fired from @entity1 and was sued by his former band mates for using the group 's name to promote his solo career			0
he filed a $ 7 million countersuit , alleging his co-founders were not legally authorised to remove him from the band			0
record : according to the @entity21 website , a man with the name @entity119 , born on october 27 , 1967 - the same name and birthdate as the star - was arrested on july 26 at 10.13am and charged with a felony			0

@entity127 *sheriff* @entity126 told @entity23 they had arrested @entity0
believed he was in prison for a month for burglary and drug possession
but singer posted video on @entity20 proving he was in studio
police now admit they were duped by a man named @entity42
