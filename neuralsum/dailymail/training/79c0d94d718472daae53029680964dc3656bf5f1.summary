now here ’s a creepy bit of news : employers are thinking outside the box , going beyond offering staff the company car , bonus scheme , health insurance and workplace gym			1
the offer — do n’t all rush now , girls ! — is of a bout of invasive surgery and a cold - store for your hopes of a future family			1
deep in @entity20 , where the best and worst ideas come from , we hear word that @entity24 and @entity25 are offering female employees a hideous new perk			1
the company will keep the eggs frozen for you and pay the $ 20,000 - odd medical bill for hoicking them out and storing them			1
then , later on , you can draw them out , like a pension , and have a go at getting pregnant			0
how ’s that for a deal ? terrible , i ’d say			0
big , ruthless companies always did have a knack for sounding generous while snapping leg - irons on their employees			1
even lavishly gilded handcuffs can be man - traps — or , in this case , woman - traps			1
it is not difficult to work out that the really cold thing in this equation is the heart of the corporate boss			0
it seems that women , the pesky critters , are now leaving high - tech companies at twice the rate of men			1
presumably ( though this may not have occurred to the management ) , this is because the intensity of the business is hostile to any kind of decent human family life			0
women working for @entity24 can receive £ 12,500 a time for freezing their eggs so they work longer one spokesman for a company offering this new service says it ‘ cares deeply about our employees and their families ’ and simply desires to ‘ empower women to do the best work of their lives ’			1
well , one might diffidently suggest that there are other ways in which you can do this empowering thing			0
embrace flexibility , job - shares , distance - working , creches			1
set up your own nursery and primary school on site — you ’re certainly rich enough ! or just take a more benign attitude to women coming back after a five - year maternity break , and be sure to provide technical catch - up and mentoring during that break			1
these cutting - edge companies could pioneer fantastic ways of keeping mothers included in the workforce without ruining their lives or playing @entity109 with their biology and life plan			1
but no : with absurdly touching faith in a newish technology , they decide to set up an in - house cryopreservation and egg - storage programme , so they can keep every young woman ’s nose to the grindstone , developing apps or networked solar - powered cyber-baseball - caps or whatever			1
and then , once the dear old thing is slowing down a bit , streaking past 40 , creaking a little , running out of cool , young ideas — just hand over the freezer - bags and send her hobbling off down the mommy - track			1
the technology for bringing forth pregnancies from frozen female eggs is indeed remarkable			2
it was developed to help women with cancer , whose reproductive kit was about to be blasted by chemo and radiotherapy			2
that was a merciful idea , but even so it has never been a simple , pat answer			0
one gung - ho @entity143 doctor is quoted as saying it is a ‘ tried and true ’ method , and that wealthy parents sometimes pay for their ambitious daughters to have their eggs frozen for distant future use			1
the eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers , according to the technology giants but think about it : the process begins with an operation , and probably hormone treatment			1
and then , years later , it is n’t just a matter of getting these ancient eggs out and hatching a baby			2
it involves more hormones and in - vitro fertilisation , which itself has a limited success rate ( ah , the years , the tears we have all seen friends enduring under this regime ! )			2
and using pre-frozen eggs has an even lower success rate , according to latest figures — barely 25 per cent , if you ’re lucky			2
for any company to imply otherwise , when dealing with young , ambitious employees eager for promotion , is disingenuous			2
if not bordering on downright wicked			0
imagine a talented employee in her late - 20s , looking at men powering ahead through their fourth decade , working stupid hours , giving everything to the company			1
she wonders whether she has to make a choice between career advancement and having babies of her own			0
she ’s in a quandary			0
her boss is holding out tempting possibilities			0
and here ’s a company leaflet with some doctor , high on technology , blithely suggesting that she can delay the baby thing for as long as she likes , and have it all			2
might she be tempted ? one spokesman for a company offering the new service says it ‘ cares deeply about our employees and their families ’ and simply desires to ‘ empower women to do the best work of their lives ’ or , indeed , terrified			1
for — more sinisterly — who can guarantee that opting for the egg - freezing ‘ perk ’ will not become an unofficial prerequisite for a young woman who hopes for promotion ? will the firm ’s @entity209 keep the list of freezers secret from @entity213 ? or will there be an unspoken nod given to promotion of the egg - storer — ‘ great girl , very dedicated ’ — and an indifferent head - shake directed at those who are thought likely to get pregnant naturally ? naturally ! because it is a natural thing , an ancient thing , this desire to give birth at the moment when it feels emotionally and physically right , even if not professionally convenient			2
of course , fertility technology — for those who truly need it — is marvellous , life - enhancing , blessed			2
but never forget what a lovely thing it is to produce a child as a result of making love , of a night with a trusted partner in the drowsy or passionate warmth of your own bed , at home			0
who would choose , deliberately and in full health , to give this up in favour of operations , anxiety , dependence on white coats and sterile laboratories ? to break , unnecessarily , the link with thousands of years of our foremothers who — in the privacy of their own love — made new life and then confided its beginnings to their men ? using pre-frozen eggs has a low success rate , according to latest figures — barely 25 per cent , if you ’re lucky so no , it ’s not a perk			0
it ’s creepy , and corporate , and dry - hearted , and impractical : a particular kind of silliness which , if i may be sexist for a moment , is quintessentially male			0
schoolboy sci - fi stuff			0
it ’s also another example of something familiar in less exotic places and trades : the attitude of big business that hey , even if these damn women insist on joining the party , even if you really do need their talents , they ’ve got ta toe the line , fit the template			0
the little ladies , @entity109 bless ’ em , must be ruthlessly fitted into a pattern and culture which has been set over decades by a workforce of males			0
and , what is more , those males are culturally unaccustomed to paying much attention to their children , or indeed to their own mental health and human values			0
sunrise industries ? some hope			0
sounds as though @entity25 and @entity24 are embracing the old , musty principles of the dark ages .			1
