a woman has revealed how she has to hire a babysitter to look after her dolls – because she believes they are possessed by the ghosts of dead people			1
@entity6 , 33 , from @entity7 , has spent thousands of pounds on what she claims are haunted dolls and believes they are possessed and if they are left alone they will cause mischief in her home			1
the full - time mother - of - two says her nights are taken up with chatting to her charges about how they died			1
' i became interested in the spirit world in 2008 , while living in @entity30 , @entity31 , because i felt the presence of a spirit , ' she said			1
' this started my interest in the paranormal and when i moved to @entity7 in november 2008 i started researching spooky things and stumbled upon haunted dolls			1
' @entity39 was the first doll that @entity19 purchases and she said that she immediately knew she was a ' person ' each of @entity44 's dolls has a story			1
pictured : @entity46 ( left ) was a woman who was 33 when she died in a plane crash and @entity48 ( right ) was a witch who died in her 30s @entity6 was first intrigued when she discovered through online shops and forums there were dolls with spiritual powers			1
' haunted dolls are not possessed as such , the doll is the spirit 's home			1
' the spirit is attached to the doll and sometimes leaves it in the same way humans go to work every day			1
' you can buy a doll , get it in the post , and the spirit comes with it			1
' @entity6 has to hire a babysitter while she is out to prevent the dolls from causing mischief a shop in @entity73 , @entity74 , sells the dolls in the @entity76 and scores of people chat about the subject on forums			1
enthralled by this new discovery , in august 2010 @entity81 ordered her first doll , @entity39 , from the @entity84 for just £ 10			1
@entity6 says that as soon as @entity39 arrived she began to notice spooky goings - on in her home			1
' when she arrived i realised straight away she was not a doll , she was a person , ' she said			1
' that night i put her near the television i told her : " if you 're happy switch it off , if you are not happy leave it			0
" ' the response was terrifying			0
the tv switched off and on , the lights flickered and i knew it was mystical talking to me through the electricity			0
' she told me she was happy to have been adopted by me			0
' i was overwhelmed and had to put her away			0
' but a week later , @entity6 tried to ' speak ' to the doll again			1
' she told me , in the same process through the tv , that she had died when she was 103 and is very wise			1
' after coming to terms with @entity39 's power , @entity6 decided she wanted more dolls and has now bought 12			1
@entity19 now says that she sources her dolls from a number of different places			1
' i usually get the dolls from collectors who have websites dedicated to them			1
' they have purchased the dolls from people who did n't know the doll was haunted			1
' she says she is happy to spend a fair amount on the dolls because you are buying into their history			2
' cost depends on quality and history			0
you ca n't put a price on them , because they 're so much more than dolls , they 're links to another world			2
' @entity6 has even sacrificed her basic needs in order to fund her habit			1
' i am happy to go without other things to buy the dolls			2
i make my own clothes rather than buy new			0
' @entity6 says that @entity140 ( right ) is the most active of her dolls and that @entity142 ( left ) is possibly evil @entity19 uses specialist ghost - hunting equipment to chat to her dolls , including voice recorders			1

' you can hear them			0
they sound like humans , having conversations in the background			0
' i heard a doorbell once , and i do n't even have one			0
' despite having devoted much of her time and money to the dolls not everyone is as keen on the collection as @entity19			2
' usually my sons are not scared by the dolls , they like them and read to them			2
' but they are a bit scared of my latest doll , @entity142 , as her body is soft and her head heavy			2
' some relatives do n't like them , they make them nervous			0
' @entity173 ( left ) and @entity174 ( right ) died in their twenties and apparently love to gossip together it was the purchase of @entity140 which showed miss @entity6 the dolls could ' misbehave			1
' ' @entity140 , the second doll i got in june 2011 , is a baby who died from cot death in the 1980s and has since inhabited the body of a porcelain doll which i have now adopted into my care			1
' ' @entity140 is very active , he will twist his head			0
my mum noticed this too , and his facial expression changes			0
' when @entity140 sees me playing with my children i often sense him crying out : " @entity190 , play with me			0
" but what do you expect ? he is only a child			0
