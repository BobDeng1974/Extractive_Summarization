@entity0 sensationally reignited their @entity2 campaign yesterday , and in the process presented @entity4 with a timely vision of midfield magic			1
this demolition of one of @entity10 ’s superpowers was a result to rank with the finest achieved by @entity13 teams in @entity15 combat			0
@entity16 had lost only one of their last 17 home matches against @entity20 opposition but they were run ragged by @entity22 ’s rampant side , who claimed the bonus - point victory which gives them a strong chance of qualifying for the quarter - finals			1
@entity27 ( second left ) gestures to his team during @entity0 's win over @entity16 if @entity0 can beat @entity30 at home and score four tries , @entity16 would only top the pool by securing a maximum return from their trip to @entity36			1
even if @entity0 are edged out of top spot , they may well go through as one of the leading three runners - up			2
but such considerations were not of immediate concern in the away dressing room last night			0
whatever it means in the bigger picture of the tournament , this was a stand - alone performance of stunning quality and magnitude			0
@entity0 won with a swagger			2
they won by attacking from all parts when the opportunities arose and by doing so with often breathtaking cohesion and intent			0
in the first half they delivered rugby from the heavens and nearly had the contest wrapped up before the break			0
the thrills were provided by the @entity4 trio at the heart of their back line			0
@entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 simply tore the @entity16 defence to shreds			1
the @entity70 side could not contain the mesmerising , high - octane threats in @entity0 ’s 10 , 12 and 13 shirts			2
scrum - half @entity73 ( second right ) is congratulated by his team after scoring in the match @entity66 stood out in particular — even before his chip ahead and slaloming run created the late bonus - point try			1
this was a vision of collective class which will give the @entity4 coaches much to ponder when they gather for a final selection meeting today ahead of the announcement on wednesday of their @entity87 squad			0
@entity88 is a certainty at fly - half , but the clamour for @entity65 and @entity66 to be unleashed alongside him is growing			1
an artistic combination awaits the call en masse			0
@entity22 offered his own ecstatic assessment after this epic triumph at @entity97 , saying : ‘ @entity66 was sublime , outstanding , world class — all those things			2
@entity4 have a lot of decisions to make , but there is no denying what the @entity4 boys did out there today			0
’ asked about @entity66 ’s case for a return to the @entity111 side , @entity0 ’s director of rugby added : ‘ he ’s very close			1
it depends on the way @entity115 wants to play , but @entity66 has really stepped it up			2
i know the @entity4 coaches are meeting tomorrow , so they ’re going to have a good re-think			0
’ @entity118 signs autographs for supporters before the start of the game if @entity115 and his assistants want to exploit the potential of their wide runners , then the evidence of the first half - hour here should convince them that @entity65 and @entity66 must be in the mix. they inspired @entity0 ’s onslaught which caused disbelief in the stadium			1
an early @entity64 penalty was followed by a slick first try for the visitors in the seventh minute			0
@entity138 ’s forceful drive generated impetus , then @entity73 ’s deft off - load released @entity118 and the @entity142 flanker sent giant wing @entity143 galloping over			1
@entity22 converted to give his side a double - digit lead but @entity16 ’s power was always likely to be a factor and , sure enough , they hit back with a try from a lineout drive , but it proved to be a brief reprieve			1
in the 24th minute , as the hosts were building menacingly in the @entity0 22 , @entity153 ’s pass was intercepted by @entity73 , who sprinted 80 metres to score			1
moments later , @entity88 ’s men struck again in fine style			0
@entity65 stormed clear from his own half , picked out @entity143 with a well - timed pass and the wing in turn off - loaded for @entity66 to touch down			1
@entity118 ( right ) closes down @entity161 ( centre ) as he is in possession the conversion made it 22 - 7 and soon after , @entity0 almost killed the contest			1
@entity167 set off a raid from deep , @entity88 and @entity66 kept up the momentum but @entity100 failed to take the chance			2
when @entity172 , who later disgraced himself with a theatrical dive , went over at the other end , it looked as if @entity0 might pay for squandering that opening			1
but they did n’t , thanks to a display of defiant spirit to go with all their eye - catching flair			0
@entity64 ’s try - saving tackle on the rampaging @entity183 was a turning point , as were the scrum penalties the visitors won — the last of which brought one last penalty at the end			2
there was also a double - team tackle on @entity192 by @entity193 and @entity194 which typified the resistance			0
@entity66 created @entity0 ’s fourth try out of nothing nine minutes from time			1
from near halfway , he sent a deft little kick behind the defensive line , darted through to re-gather and swerved left around two flailing opponents			0
@entity203 charged on towards the line and he in turn sent @entity118 swallow - diving over			2
it was a magnificent try to cap a magnificent performance which suggests that @entity0 are on course to return to @entity10 ’s top table after a long absence .			0

@entity0 had a *25* point lead over @entity16 by the end of the first half
@entity143 , @entity73 and @entity66 were on the *scoresheet*
@entity118 added a fourth eight minutes from time to complete the win
