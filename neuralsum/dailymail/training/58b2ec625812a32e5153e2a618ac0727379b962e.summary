in court , the judge said that ' @entity10 clearly had the authoritiy to transfer the shares ' of the team and dismissed the claims of her disgraced husband who has been diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease and therefore unable to manage his affairs			2
' she had every good reason to believe that @entity33 agreed to the sale of the team , ' @entity50 judge @entity6 said			1
the judge said his tentative ruling would take formal effect when he issues it in writing in coming weeks			0
' either way , we 'd win , ' @entity10 said outside the courtroom			0
' i am just doing what i had to do			0
' @entity2 claimed his wife deceived him about the medical exams			0
@entity2 has vowed to fight the @entity35 until his death and is expected to continue to wage court battles to stop the sale			1
the ruling in @entity50 is unlikely to put an end to the bizarre saga that began in april when a recording surfaced of @entity71 scolding his young girlfriend @entity72 for bringing black men to @entity5 games			0
recordings : pictured here in @entity78 on friday is @entity79			0
the socialite recorded @entity2 making the racist comments about @entity82 that sparked the whole controversial episode decision : @entity2 's lawyer @entity85 leaves the courthouse during a lunch - break in @entity9 , @entity88 on july 28 , 2014 before final arguments in the @entity71 vs @entity2 case between husband @entity33 and wife @entity10 over the sale of the @entity35 's @entity5 the @entity35 moved quickly to ban @entity2 for life and fined him $ 2.5 million			1
@entity2 was apologetic after the audio recording went viral , but his mea culpa backfired when he criticized @entity96 great @entity95 , who had been photographed with @entity2 's girlfriend , as a bad role model for kids because he had @entity100			2
@entity2 was roundly criticized from locker rooms to the @entity102 , where president @entity103 called @entity2 's remarks ' incredibly offensive racist statements			2
' with the @entity35 threatening to seize the team and auction it , @entity2 initially gave his wife of 58 years permission to negotiate a sale but then refused to sign it			1
he said he would sue the league instead and then revoked the trust			0
couple at war : @entity2 , owner of the @entity5 , left and his wife @entity10 pose for a photograph before his team played the @entity117 in @entity118 of the @entity119 during the 2012 @entity120 in may , 2012 the nonjury trial held over several weeks focused mainly on whether @entity10 properly removed her husband as a trustee and whether her actions carried any weight after he revoked the trust			1
@entity2 's lawyers contended that his wife and her lawyers conspired to trick him and that the mental exams by two doctors were faulty			1
they said @entity2 did n't know his competency as a trustee was being evaluated and that he showed no signs of incompetence on the witness stand			0
in combative testimony , @entity2 said he would ' never , ever sell ' the team he bought in 1981 for about $ 12 million			0
before taking the stand , he kissed his wife and then testified that he loved her			0
but the following day when she approached him in court he yelled , ' get away from me , you pig ! ' war : @entity10 sits with her husband , @entity2 , during the @entity5 ' @entity35 basketball game against the @entity149 in @entity9 in 2010 @entity2 , a lawyer who made a fortune as a landlord , has filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court against the @entity35 and he sued his wife , @entity35 commissioner @entity155 and the league in state court			1
lawyers for @entity10 and @entity16 had urged the judge to let the sale go through because it was in the best interest of the family trust			1
they said an auction was less likely to bring such a high price and that coach @entity167 , key players and sponsors were likely to walk if @entity2 's ownership was prolonged			2
' the trust has a golden bird in the hand , ' @entity10 's lawyers wrote in court papers			0
' a sale of the @entity5 for $ 2 billion is indisputably a bonanza for the @entity2 family			1
@entity33 's strident opposition is motivated by only selfish considerations			0
