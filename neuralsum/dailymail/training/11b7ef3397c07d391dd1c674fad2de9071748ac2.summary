@entity0 points out that grappling , holding and shirt - pulling in the penalty area is simply bad defending - and insists only harsh action will get rid of it			1
the former left back , now @entity5 manager , is adamant that until referees start awarding penalties for every single instance which ends up deciding the results of matches , the practice will never stop			1
in 17 matches this season he has not seen a single penalty awarded to his side or the opposition for the offence			1
@entity0 believes referees must start awarding penalties to eradicate grappling in penalty areas the issue has come to the fore once more following @entity23 's 1 - 1 draw against @entity24 on sunday @entity26 's @entity25 ( right ) conceded a penalty for this grapple with @entity30 's @entity29 in october @entity32 's @entity31 ( centre ) has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking and holding hands off in the box is @entity40 's new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity23 vs @entity24 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity51			1
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			1
it 's time to end that			0
so join us in our campaign to say @entity59 to players and referees			1
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
‘ it has become a part of the game at the moment , ’ @entity0 ( right ) said			1
‘ part of me thinks it ’s poor defending , i see players not even looking at the ball			0
that ca n’t be right			0
‘ we ’ve got to understand when you ’re holding someone in the box , it ’s bad play , because you ’re actually giving a penalty away			1
‘ the only way it will get outlawed is if the officials start giving penalties for every individual hold that there is in the box			2
‘ you either ignore it in both boxes , which really seems to be what ’s going on at this moment in time , or alternatively you stamp down on it and you might get three or four penalties and it might decide the result of games			2
’ it was never a tactic pearce employed as a defender			0
he won 78 caps for @entity102 and made more than 700 appearances in @entity105 football			0
the 52 - year - old claims that barely any grappling and holding happened in the area when he was a player			1
‘ i ’ve got to say when i played there was n’t anywhere near as much grappling in this country that i ’m seeing in the game at the moment , ’ he explained			2
‘ i think we only ever really saw it on the international stage , if i ’m being honest			0
‘ but it has come into our game and myself as a manager and a footballing person would be quite happy to see the officials stamp on it a little bit more than they are at present			0
‘ it ’s difficult for officials			0
if you isolated every individual one - on - one marking situation in the box , you ’d probably see three or four penalties at every corner or free kicks			1
’ as a manager , this is not an aspect of the game @entity0 encourages amongst his own teams			2
he added : ‘ you certainly do n’t coach your team at set plays and say just ignore the ball and grapple hold of your striker			0
you watch the ball , you watch your man and you deal with the ball and you attempt to head it before he does if it comes into your area			0
it ’s as simple as that			0
’ @entity0 ’s playing career spanned 24 years , starting at @entity156 in 1978 and ending in 2002 at @entity157			2
he believes this scourge on the game has been brought on by the high demands placed on players and managers to get results			0
‘ the game ’s become very clinical in this day and age , in regards to the organisation of teams and the pressure that ’s put on the teams and the managers , ’ @entity0 said			2
@entity0 ( left ) believes that barely any grappling and holding happened in the area when he was a player @entity0 was speaking at a @entity175 event at @entity176			1
