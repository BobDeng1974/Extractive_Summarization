@entity0 , a country ravaged by a brutal civil war that claimed more than 2.5 million lives over five decades , was finally split in two in 2011			1
and the world 's newest country is now home to the world 's newest national football team , dubbed the @entity8 by besotted fans			2
@entity10 - an impassioned and eccentric @entity11 football coach who has worked with 14 national teams , including @entity13 and @entity14 - was invited by the @entity15 to take charge			1
coach @entity17 : the @entity0 national team with coach @entity10 before the team 's match against @entity21 @entity0 's national team starting line - up : @entity24 , left to right , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ; @entity31 , left to right , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 so , despite the fact he had never heard of @entity0 , @entity17 travelled to the country and set off immediately on a scouting mission			1
and there he discovered the obstacles faced by @entity0 's very first national football team to be world 's apart from those tackled on the pitches of other countries			2
young @entity48 documentary filmmaker @entity47 was in @entity0 when he heard about a determined coach who claimed he would find his new team a place in the @entity52 , so he travelled to the capital city of @entity54 to meet him			1
patriotic : a picture taken on june 26 , 2012 shows @entity50 's coach @entity10 looking at his players as they put their left hands over their hearts before shouting ' long live @entity0 ' as part of a ritual performed before and after a training session , in @entity54 the coach and his team : @entity17 soon discovered that the problems faced by a football team in @entity0 would be quite different to any he had faced before @entity69 , the newly appointed president of the @entity70 of @entity0 , told @entity71 that the formation of a federation and a national team ' brought great hope to @entity0 '			1
one talented young player said : ' @entity77 became a way of life in @entity0			0
we are not politicians , we are just footballers , but our sport can bring peace to a town full of war			0
' but a lack of funding meant that @entity17 - who says he will give everything , even ' money and blood ' to motivate his team - set off to scout for players ... on a public bus			2
and without a road map			0
' this is not @entity97 there is no map , ' he was told by local people			0
@entity17 named his team @entity101 ( ' we are tigers , champions , winners , real men ! ' ) , but soon learned that even tigers could n't demolish the problems faced by such a new country			0
on the pitch : @entity0 's @entity30 , right , fights for the ball with @entity112 's @entity111 during the @entity113 ( @entity113 ) @entity52 football tournament match between @entity0 and @entity112 in @entity115 , on november 27 , 2013 a man and his sheep : champion , the @entity0 team mascot , whom @entity17 feels will bring luck and prosperity to his men for once he had collated a team of talented young men and played their first match , the @entity0 government announced they were ceasing oil production in order to cut off the dependent @entity130			1
austerity measures cut all funds for @entity133 , and @entity17 was not paid for six months			0
he appealed to the ministry but to no avail , by which time he was struck down by malaria			0
and though he survived to care for his sheep , champion , the team mascot ; one of his players did not			0
eventually the new pitch was locked , @entity17 and his team left with nowhere to play , and the passionate @entity11 declaring : ' the country is sabotaging these young people who have great spirit , great talent , and great willing			2
and this is criminal in sport			0
' @entity71 's film explores the courage and determination of @entity17 and his players , and the challenges they face in continuing to play national football in such a young and , once again , dangerous country			1
determination : despite his courageousness , @entity17 faced many obstacles when forming the team @entity0 today : children playing in @entity0 , today watch the whole story of coach @entity17 and his @entity8 tonight on @entity163 at 10pm .			1

@entity0 was formed in 2011 after the 50 - year @entity0 civil war
over 2.5m people died in the war , but the new country sprang out of hope
football coach @entity10 *recruited* to form national team
he *planned* to bring his team to the @entity52
but @entity17 was not prepared for the obstacle he would face
@entity48 documentary filmmaker @entity47 followed the team 's story
