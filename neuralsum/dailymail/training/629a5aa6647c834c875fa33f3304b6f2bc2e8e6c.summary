by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 accused @entity3 of ' rank and rotten ' defending as the @entity5 endured a hellish return to @entity7			1
@entity8 strolled to an easy 2 - 0 win that ended @entity3 's hopes of @entity12 qualification with four matches remaining			1
@entity2 was barracked by the home support throughout and one @entity8 fan even turned up in a @entity17 's costume to poke fun at the @entity3 boss from just behind the dugout			1
rank and rotten : @entity2 was unimpressed with @entity3 's defending back : @entity2 walks into the away dugout at @entity7 ahead of the match @entity24 and new : @entity2 shakes hands with his successor @entity26 ( left ) before the match not looking good : @entity2 looks pensive during the early stages at @entity7 making his point : @entity2 tries to turn around @entity3 's fortunes during the second half instruction : @entity2 tries to advise @entity32 and ( below ) substitute @entity33 , to no avail here 's what i want : @entity2 instructs @entity33 as the forward prepares to go on booed : @entity2 received abuse from some @entity8 supporters on his return to @entity7 familiar surroundings : @entity2 walks into @entity7 , where he was manager for 11 years putting on a brave face : @entity2 smiles as he walks towards the visitors ' dressing room changing face of a club : @entity2 ( top left ) , next to a picture of his successor , @entity26 part of the furniture : pictures of @entity2 at @entity7 ahead of his return with @entity3 back in town : @entity2 ( right ) and @entity54 both return to @entity7 with @entity3 on the pitch it was a grim day for the @entity3 boss as his team suffered their 11th defeat of the season			1
@entity61 blocked @entity63 's shot with his outstretched arm and @entity65 converted the resulting spot - kick before @entity67 played @entity69 onside and the @entity71 beat @entity72 from a tight angle			0
@entity2 tried to put a positive spin on what was a dreadful defeat , but he did not hold back when giving his assessment of his team 's defending for both goals			1
' i thought the two goals we conceded today were rank , rotten , ' the @entity3 boss said			1
' the ( first ) goal was a big kick up the pitch , it was nodded down and picked up , and for us to concede a goal like that was terrible			0
' the second was a better move but we should have defended it much better that we did			0
' we gave away two terrible goals but prior to that we passed the ball brilliantly well , kept the ball , had great control of the game			1
' what we could n't do is make enough chances , but we had a great control and we got done by two stupid decisions			0
' @entity100 penalty : the ball strikes @entity61 on the hand , prompting referee @entity103 to award a penalty paying the penalty : @entity65 drives home the spot - kick to score @entity8 's opener @entity107 feeling blue again : @entity32 , another former @entity8 man , looks downcast after the opener signing in : @entity110 gives fans his autograph on his arrival at @entity7 read the match report from @entity7 here the result and the performances of both sides showed just how much @entity3 have regressed under @entity118 and how far @entity8 have come under his successor @entity26 , who has now collected a record 20 league wins since moving to @entity7			1
@entity3 tested @entity122 on just two occasions while @entity8 out - muscled and outclassed their opponents in midfield			1
@entity32 had a disappointing afternoon in front of goal while @entity63 caused @entity129 and @entity61 problems throughout			0
thanks for the support : @entity8 striker @entity131 signs autographs ahead of the match @entity2 , surprisingly , thought his team did not play too badly			1
' we played very well in the first half , ' said @entity2 , who spent 11 years at @entity8 before moving to @entity136			1
' we had passed the ball really well , kept the ball but we did n't have the final pass , the killer through ball that was needed in the final third			2
' i did n't think we deserved to go in 2 - 0 down at half - time , that 's for sure			0
' we had good play , good control of the game , and we had the bulk of the ball			2
' the way we were : @entity2 ( centre ) waves to the fans after walking through the guard of honour after his final match in charge of @entity8 @entity26 , who became the first @entity8 boss to do the double over @entity3 in 44 years , hailed his team 's performance as ' electrifying '			1
' this was an important win for our fans , ' said the @entity166			0
' we knew that since the 1969 - 70 season we had never done the double over @entity3 and i think that is when we won the league			1
' that tells you this group of players is ready to develop			0
' that performance was full of energy , it was dynamic on the counter attack			0
i thought we looked electrifying			0
' despite the midweek defeat to @entity180 , @entity8 are just one point short of fourth - placed @entity182 with three matches left			2
@entity26 is refusing to get carried away with talk of his team pipping the @entity186 to fourth , though			2
' we have another nine points to fight for , ' said @entity26			2
' we play @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 a week before the cup final			0
you could n't pick a worse three games			0
' for @entity2 the season is over			2
he now has the unwanted tag of being the man who has failed to take @entity3 into the @entity12 for the first time in 19 years			2
as ever , there was an attempt from the @entity5 to cast a positive light on his team 's woeful season			1
' i think everybody knows that we are on track to make changes and do some different things , ' he said			0
' i understand it has not been good , i recognise it has not been good , and it needs to be better			0
