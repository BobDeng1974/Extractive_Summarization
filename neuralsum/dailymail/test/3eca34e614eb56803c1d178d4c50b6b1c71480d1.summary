it was a case of so near , yet so far for the @entity1 today as she roared on her filly , @entity3 , at @entity4 today			1
the monarch , who was resplendent in a fuchsia suit and a matching hat , appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers in the @entity9			0
unfortunately for @entity1 , her horse was narrowly pipped to the post - prompting a brief look of horror and a rueful smile from her owner			1
oh no ! the @entity1 allows herself a look of horror as @entity3 is narrowly pipped to the post one is not amused : the @entity1 briefly looks glum before smiling at her second place finish better than nothing : the @entity1 's second place appeared to go down well and she got a third place later on @entity1 , who has long been an avid racing fan , had a second runner later in the afternoon but was once again left to rue missed chances after her horse @entity26 came in third			1
@entity4 is currently hosting the @entity27 , one of the most prestigious dates on the flat racing calendar			0
the event , which coincides with the racecourse 's annual real ale festival , also saw runners owned by fellow royal @entity35 of @entity36 take to the track			0
unfortunately for the @entity41 , the horses bred by his @entity39 also failed to triumph with one , @entity42 , taking second place in the @entity44			0
despite failing to register a win , the 88 - year - old monarch was on cheerful form and chatted happily to jockey @entity48 in the parade ring ahead of the @entity50			1
top tips : the @entity1 chatted to @entity53 's jockey @entity48 ahead of the race looking around : @entity1 , joined by racing manager @entity55 ( second right ) , toured the parade ring enjoying the day : afterwards , she made her way back to the @entity9 in the grandstand the @entity1 certainly has plenty to smile about , with her fifth great - grandchild due next weekend and sex claims against her son prince @entity62 struck out by a @entity64 judge			1
she has also been making the most of the recent spell of hot weather and has been pictured twice in the last seven days enjoying a trot around @entity69			0
@entity1 , who usually rides wearing a silk scarf rather than a riding hat , first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a @entity75 pony , named @entity76 , aged four			2
since then , the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds , among them @entity81 , a black farm - bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50 's , and @entity86 , a grey gelding whom the @entity1 famously galloped down the course at @entity90 in 1961			1
lovely : the queen was resplendent in a cheerful fuchsia coat and a matching hat @entity94 : the @entity1 has multiple reasons to be cheerful at the moment , including the impending royal birth great - grandchild : the @entity99 and @entity99 of @entity101 's second child will be her fifth great - grandchild recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over @entity109 on horseback			2
nevertheless , the @entity1 remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and , according to sources , is a familiar sight at her @entity69 stables			2
she is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies , some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren , notably @entity120 's children , @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity123			0
along with her thoroughbred race horses , the queen also breeds @entity127 ponies and has a stud specialising in @entity130 ponies at @entity131			0
so close : @entity3 ( left ) tries to make up the gap between her and @entity133 @entity134 : in the event , @entity133 galloped ahead to win the @entity50 at @entity4			2

the @entity1 crossed her fingers as @entity3 galloped home
unfortunately , the two - year - old thoroughbred was pipped to the post
she had another runner later in the afternoon which managed third
