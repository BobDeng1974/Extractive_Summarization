@entity2 , dubbed the @entity11 , spent 45 years in jail after raping and murdering a seven - year - old girl			1
he was also suspected of strangling two other children			0
it has now emerged that the @entity0 - which is advised to pay a ' reasonable ' contribution for the funerals of those who die in prison - spent £ 2,686 on his send - off , including £ 15 on a floral tribute			1
the other costs included £ 1,165 on the registration of his death , £ 285 on the coffin , £ 185 on hearse and a cremation fee of £ 751			1
the 84 - year - old paedophile was jailed in february 1969 after snatching schoolgirl @entity30 off a street two years earlier and strangling her to death			1
the notorious killer was also prime suspect in the murders of five - year - old @entity35 and six - year - old @entity36 , both of whom disappeared in 1965			2
the bodies of all three girls - who had also been sexually assaulted and strangled - were dumped within a few miles of each other beside the @entity42 on @entity43 , @entity44			2
@entity45 , a retired police officer who spent 18 months tracking down the child killer , said she was horrified that taxpayers ' money was used to pay for @entity2 's funeral			1
she said : ' taxpayers ' money should not be spent in this way on that particular prisoner , especially buying flowers for him			0
' i 'm sure the families of his victims would be disgusted			0
@entity43 will never forget what he did			0
' @entity60 , chief executive of the @entity61 , said added that the @entity0 should only pay ' the bare minimum '			0
he said : ' in circumstances like these , the prison service should do nothing more than the bare minimum required of them by law			0
@entity2 was convicted of the murder of @entity30 , seven ( left ) and was the prime suspect in the murders of @entity36 , six , ( centre ) and @entity35 ( right ) whose bodies were all found near the same spot @entity2 , 84 , died in @entity76 ( pictured ) after being diagnosed with leukemia			1
the prison paid £ 15 for a floral tribute at his service ' using taxpayers ' money to do anything above and beyond that is little more than an insult to the families involved , and to the people of @entity43			1
' under the @entity90 directive , prisons are advised to offer a contribution towards ' reasonable funeral expenses ' of up to £ 3,000			1
the @entity0 said it considers these ' reasonable costs ' to include funeral director 's fees , a hearse , a coffin , cremation and burial fees and ministers fees			1
a wreath can also be included on behalf of the prison , but not on behalf of the prisoner 's family			0
the news of @entity30 's death as it was reported on the front page of the @entity108 in 1967 his alibi fell apart when his wife @entity111 revoked her statement that they had been shopping together in contrast , a so - called paupers ' funeral - known as a @entity115 by its proper name - can cost the government as little as £ 100			1
these funerals usually take place when a person does not have family or friends to arrange the funeral			0
local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility but can claim back the costs from the deceased 's estate			0
these services are very simple and usually involve being transported by a van - rather than a hearse - and being buried in a communal grave , depending on what is available locally			1
the convicted killer being hidden from public view as he was taken to @entity140 in 1967 @entity2 's crime sparked one of the biggest manhunts in @entity145 history			2
the three girls were all found near the @entity42 , @entity44 ( pictured ) although the cost can vary from as little as £ 100 to £ 3,000 , the average cost is around £ 1,000 - around a third of the maximum grant for a prisoner 's funeral			1

under the directive @entity164 , the prison is advised to pay a contribution towards ' reasonable funeral expenses ' of up to £ 3,000			1
the maximum grant is around three times the average amount paid out by the state for a so - called pauper burial			1
the only exceptions are where a prisoner 's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments , for example the @entity178			0
the @entity0 said it considers ' reasonable funeral costs ' to include : funeral director 's fees ; a hearse ; a simple coffin ; cremation and burial fees ( which does not include the cost of the burial plot ) and ministers fees			1
these costs do not include a headstone , embalming for viewing the deceased , clothes for the deceased and mourners , a wake , obituary notices or an order of service			0
a wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison , but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family			1
separately , benefit dependent families can apply to a government fund known as @entity206 to assist with the cost			0
and another another provision , local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility			0
officially known as a @entity115 - but still widely known as paupers ’ funerals or welfare funerals - the deceased is given a simple service before being cremated or buried in a communal grave which could have been reused up to three or four times , depending on what is available locally			1
often the body is transported in a van rather than a hearse while the service is conducted in a vacant slot , such as early in the morning , at a local crematorium or cemetery chapel			0
a study conducted by the @entity231 in 2011 estimated that there are around 2,900 such services a year			0
the cost of paupers ' funerals can vary from around £ 100 to up to £ 3,000 , depending on the local authority			1
a spokesman for the @entity0 said it considered the single floral tribute at @entity2 's service as a ' reasonable cost ' in the funeral arrangement			1
the spokesman added : ' if a prisoner dies in custody in @entity158 and @entity159 the governor or director of the prison in which the death occurred is able to offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable expenses for a basic funeral			1
' @entity164 advises that prisons must offer to pay a contribution towards reasonable funeral expenses of up to £ 3,000			1
this is considered to be moral and decent in the circumstances			0
' the only exceptions are where a prisoner 's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments , for example the @entity178			0
' @entity266 responsible for mr @entity2 's funeral have confirmed that embalming is standard practice at their business in order to preserve the body should anybody wish to view it at any stage			1
' a wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison , but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family			1
' ' taxpayers ' money should not - and in future will not - be spent on flowers for offenders who die in prison			1

the 83 - year - old , who died at a care home in @entity324 , @entity325 , was given a ' heroic send - off ' , including a full military guard of honour			2
