one of the ' naive and impressionable ' teenage boys who was stopped in @entity2 as he tried to join @entity4 had written cruel jibes about the murder of soldier @entity7 on social media , it has emerged			1
the 17 - year - old boy , an @entity10 student from @entity11 , north west @entity12 , was stopped at @entity13 in @entity14 with his 17 - year - old cousin and another 19 - year - old man on saturday			1
it has now been revealed that prior to him fleeing @entity18 , he made comments on social media criticising the ' eruption ' of public grief over the @entity24 murder of solder @entity7 , who was brutally killed near the @entity25 in @entity26 , south east @entity12 in may 2013			1
a friend of the boy has now spoken about his fears that the teenager was radicalised by an older pupil at the school			1
the source told @entity51 : ' his radical views were well known			1
he fell in with a boy and was influenced by his extreme views			1
' he was extremely bright and wanted to go to university to study engineering			2
' on friday when he went missing , he told people he was going to prayers			2
' it is understood that one of the teenagers attended @entity63 in @entity64 , where students were recently told that weekly prayer sessions must be taken only in @entity67 amid fears of radicalisation			2
pupils claimed that as part of the new requirements , a teacher must also be present at all times during prayers			0
the three teenagers , who have not been named , were intercepted by officials after the shocked families of the younger boys learned of their plans and quickly alerted police , who waited at the airport as the flight landed from @entity85 , @entity86			2
the teens , all from @entity11 , north west @entity12 , were stopped at @entity13 in @entity14 when an officer checked their passports and ordered for them to be taken to a ' risk and analysis ' centre it is believed they travelled from mainland @entity86 to try and dodge being caught			1
however , they were stopped as they went through passport control at the @entity2 airport after landing at about 11pm on saturday			1
@entity99 footage shows an immigration officer checking the passports of each of the teenage boys before telling them they will not be able to proceed to the arrivals hall			1
they are then escorted to a ' risk and analysis centre ' in the airport by officials			2
all three teenagers were later put on a return flight to @entity12 and taken into custody at a high - security police station for questioning			2
they have since been released on bail after being quizzed by counter-terror officers on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism			1
yesterday , it emerged that one of the boys had asked the council when he could return to school			0
the two younger teenage boys were at a meeting with @entity128 , the leader of @entity129 , when the question arose			0
@entity128 , the leader of @entity129 , spoke to the teenagers and their families this week and does not believe they were radicalised but ' naive ' mr @entity128 told @entity133 : ' one of them was saying to me " when can i go back to school ? " ' i said to him i think you have to wait a little bit longer to let things settle down and we can work with the school and everyone else and make sure things are right for you to go back			2
' mr @entity128 , who met with the teenagers and their families , said both of the boys had been behaving normally prior to disappearing			0
he said : ' the children had no conversations about any kind of radical speak or anything else , the conversations were absolutely normal			0
' @entity151 had a conversation with his father the night before and the father had asked him do you want some pocket money ? ' the father gave him £ 20 and the child gave him £ 10 back			0
if someone is preparing to go somewhere i think you would take as much money with you as possible			2
and for him to give £ 10 back does n't suggest he had anything prepared or was going to do anything wrong			0
' the politician said he believed that they had been ' caught up in emotions ' rather than radicalised and were ' naive ' teenagers who had made a mistake and were relieved to come home			2
he said : ' personally i do n't think they had been radicalised , absolutely not			0
i think what they 've done is they 've been caught up in emotions as such			0
' they were looking for a platform to speak up or to say something and they have n't found a space or a platform where they can have a grown up conversation about events in @entity183			0
' i met with the two boys			0
i met with the two families as well and you could not meet a more normal family			0
the two young kids they are grade a students and both of them have aspirations , one to be an engineer and one to be a doctor			0
' it just beggars belief these guys got caught up in their own thinking as such , of trying to go out there and do some good			0
all they 've said from the conversations i have with them is that they wanted to go out there and help			0
' in light of the recent claims that one of the boys held extremist views before fleeing the country , mr @entity128 issued a fresh statement today in which he said : ' our conversations with the children point to them both being remorseful for the pain and anguish they have caused their families and the local community			1
' every parent will recognise that children , in their teenage years , can be naïve and they will make mistakes			2
' @entity129 is fully focused on working with the families and our partners to ensure these children get the support and guidance they need			0
' it came as the ' devastated ' families of the boys said they could n't ' thank the police and @entity2 authorities enough ' for getting them home safely			1
mr @entity128 said : ' they are just normal kids with aspirations like any other kids and their families would do anything to support them and they will continue to support them to make sure they become an engineer or a doctor			0
' they are 17 - years - old , they are young and naive and they are learning as they go through life			1
one of the two 17 - year - old boys is believed to have attended @entity63 in @entity64 , north west @entity12 ( pictured )			1
one pupil told today how he believes at least one of the boys was radicalised by a pupil the three @entity18 teenagers who were stopped in @entity2 were allegedly on their way to @entity183 to join @entity4			1
@entity14 has become a well - known stop off point for @entity18 jihadis wanting to flee to join terrorist in @entity183 ' the families are overjoyed to have their children back			1
you have to bear in mind they 're still schoolchildren , still studying for their a-levels , and the families were absolutely devastated to find that the children had disappeared and then to find that they were on their way to @entity14 - the family are still in shock			1
' the families are just normal , decent , hard - working families - just a normal next door family			2
you would have thought no different of them on friday than you would do today , i am sure			0
' he said the boys now want to get back to normal , adding : ' they just want to go back to school and continue their studies			0
' they made a mistake and they just want to get back to normal , so that 's what we 're going to do as a council help them get back on track			2
' mr @entity128 said the families contacted the police on friday morning as soon as they realised their boys were missing			0
the three teenagers were stopped in @entity14 in a dramatic security operation after @entity18 police tipped off their @entity2 counterparts			1
officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in @entity14 and the trio were brought back to @entity18 where they were questioned at a high - security @entity12 police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism			1
sources in @entity2 said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities but none of them are believed to be connected to any high - profile @entity4 terrorists			1
the two 17 - year - old boys , along with a 19 - year - old man , all from north - west @entity12 , were detained in @entity14 , @entity2 , the @entity299 said			1
they are believed to have been travelling to join @entity4 ( file picture ) a @entity299 spokesman said : ' they have been bailed to return to a central @entity12 police station pending further inquiries			1
' investigators now hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so			0
more than 600 @entity18 have fled @entity18 for @entity183 and @entity310 since the appalling explosion of violence in the region began			0
they include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months , many of whom wanted to become ' jihadi brides '			0
@entity4 controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause			1
@entity2 has faced criticism for not controlling its border with @entity183 , but has accused @entity326 states of failing to prevent would - be jihadists from leaving in the first place			1
@entity329 has contacted @entity129 and @entity63 for comment			0
