@entity22 , 34 , has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering @entity2			2
at @entity25 on thursday , mr @entity24 sentenced @entity2 ’s mother to four years in jail			1
during an earlier trial at @entity30 the 27 - year - old was found guilty of allowing the boy ’s death			2
mr @entity24 said : ' on the morning of march 7 , 2011 , you left @entity2 alone with @entity22 while you took your daughter and another young girl to school			1
' during the 40 minutes that you were out of the house , @entity22 kicked @entity2 in the abdomen and kicked him so hard that he flew two feet in the air			2
' the kick ruptured @entity2 ’s small bowel and this substantially contributed to his death about two hours later			0
the jury found that @entity22 had murdered @entity2			1
' he added : ' you knew that @entity22 was a violent man			1
you knew that for some 14 months he had been undergoing an anger management course			0
sorry tale : @entity22 , left , was found guilty of murder while @entity2 's mother , @entity13 was found guilty and has been jailed for allowing his death ' you knew that this had not resulted in him mending his ways			1
you knew that because only six weeks before the death of @entity2 , @entity22 had assaulted you			1
' during the trial the jury heard @entity2 and @entity22 say they found @entity2 face down on the floor after falling from the breakfast bar			1
@entity22 launched the fateful attack on his stepson after being left with the boy on march 7 last year while his mother took her daughter and his daughter to school and arranged a doctor ’s appointment			1
in june 2010 , a year before he died , @entity2 was taken to hospital with a fractured leg			0
his mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body			0
children 's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident			0
in september that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike			0
again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed it to be from a genuine accident			0
on february 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a radiator burn			0
@entity2 's mother said he was accident prone			1
he was taken to see a gp but there was no further action			0
head of children 's services at @entity101 , councillor @entity97 said : ' it was a single violent assault that led to his death and the perpetrator has now been brought to justice			2
@entity106 , executive director of @entity107 , said : ' there were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous			0
' a serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that @entity2 's death was predictable or preventable			1
mr @entity106 added : ' nonetheless the service we offered @entity2 was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing			0
' the neglectful mum was gone for just half an hour but by the time she returned the violent child murderer had kicked @entity2 hard enough to cause fatal injuries			2
@entity22 then sat the wounded child in front of a bowl of cereal to make the scene look normal when his partner returned , the court heard			1
however , once @entity2 , who worked as a cleaner during her trial , came home she realised something was wrong and they took the boy to hospital by car			0
the court heard how she made a panicked 999 call on the way in which her distress was ' palpable ' , but it was too late to save little @entity2 who died tragically inside the vehicle			1
six weeks earlier @entity22 had kicked her in the face as she lay on the ground leaving her with a swollen eye and needing hospital treatment			1
the trial heard evidence that @entity2 suffered a shopping list of ' non-accidental ' injuries in the year before his death			1
a report published after the conviction of @entity22 found that key opportunities to protect @entity2 were missed by authorities tasked with his care			2
it acknowledged previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been ' seen in isolation ' with ' minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries '			0
@entity167 , defending @entity2 , said : ' this is obviously a hugely tragic case			0
' a young boy was murdered and his mother , who the prosecution accepted liked him , and who the jury found had otherwise cared for @entity2 properly , has been held partly responsible for his death			2
' for that she has to be sentenced			0
' it was on one occasion she left home with a man who had previously been violent to her some six weeks before but who have not been violent to @entity2			2
' he added : ' she left @entity2 with him for just half an hour or so , not for selfish reasons , not for her own benefit in any way , but rather to take her daughter and in fact his daughter to school and to make an appointment for @entity2 to be seen by a doctor later that morning			0

little @entity2 's mother @entity13 was taking two other children to school
@entity25 heard she knew murdered @entity22 was a violent man because he had attacked her weeks earlier
@entity2 , five , suffered a shopping list of ' non-accidental ' injuries in the year before his death , the court heard
