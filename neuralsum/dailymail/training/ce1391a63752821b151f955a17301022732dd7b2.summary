researchers based in @entity7 surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology			1
despite 18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy @entity3 when it goes on sale next year , 51 per cent expressed serious privacy concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation			1
one in five adults in the @entity2 wants to ban @entity3 completely , according to new research			1
4,000 adults who were asked about the rise of wearable technology expressed privacy concerns about the devices earlier this month the first pornographic app for @entity3 was released before being quickly banned			1
adult app store @entity22 , makers of the headmounted pornography , were told by @entity24 to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such content			0
the ' @entity28 , ' app was downloaded from the developer 's website by 17 @entity3 owners on its debut day , while the site was visited by some 10,000 people			2
the app allowed viewers to browse adult content and , with @entity3 ’s capability of displaying and recording , the app also reportedly allowed users to record and upload their own intimate content			2
the study was commissioned by web hosting company @entity44 with the @entity47 ( @entity46 ) at @entity48			0
they asked 2,000 @entity2 adults and 2,000 adults in the @entity52 their thoughts on wearable technology including whether they would buy devices , such as @entity3 , how they think they would use it , and what their biggest concerns were			1
more than half ( 51 per cent ) of all the adults asked expressed serious privacy concerns about using wearable technology , with 53 per cent of @entity2 adults likening it to tv show ‘ @entity65 ’			1
around two thirds of all participants - 61 per cent - think @entity3 and wearable cameras should be regulated , while 20 per cent think it should be banned altogether			1
respondents in the @entity2 demand greater regulation , 69 per cent , compared to 55 per cent in the @entity52			1
' as with all new products that are cutting edge , there is always the question of how current laws , combined with consumer expectations , fit in with the product ' , says @entity78 , digital media lawyer at @entity7 - based media law firm @entity79			0
' when wearable technologies interact with other people and the environment around the user , then potential privacy or copyright issues can arise			2
' a model for adult app store @entity22 is shown wearing @entity3			2
the company released the device 's first pornography app called ' @entity91 ' monday but it was promptly shut down by @entity24			0
privacy campaigners are concerned about such adult content leading to malware and other risks on wearable technology ' the challenge for manufacturers of wearable technologies is ensuring that where the device has the potential to infringe another person ’s rights , that the user is made aware of how they should be using the device and also for other people to recognise when the device is being used in a manner which they may object , such as surreptitious videoing or photographing of people			1
' ' hopefully manufacturers will take the lead in this area so that new regulations are not needed			0
' but it should n’t come as a surprise if law makers decide to act to both compel manufacturers to take privacy and other concerns into consideration when developing these products , and also to protect people ’s expectations of privacy			2
' @entity129 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity65 , added : ' the danger with @entity3 is that the camera is seeing what you see , all the time , while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be eavesdropped on			2
how @entity3 works : a @entity139 designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image ' it is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked , so it would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like @entity149 buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual property			1
' while it ’s still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the device , the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip			2
' @entity3 offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while @entity24 ’s main interest is selling advertising , there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device			1
' the only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them			0
' in may , @entity24 's @entity3 wearable computer was hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone			1
the infographic also reveals how @entity3 is focused so the image always appears sharp hackers are able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does , and the hackers recently warned ' nothing is safe once your @entity3 has been hacked			2
' although @entity3 does not go on sale to the public until next year , the attack raises major security and privacy questions over @entity24 's plans for the device			1
despite the negative responses to the @entity44 study , an average of 18 per cent intend to buy @entity3 when it goes on sale in 2014 - 21 per cent of @entity52 and 15 per cent of @entity202			0
71 per cent of @entity202 believe that these cloud - powered devices have enhanced their lives in some way and 12 per cent of @entity2 adults are already using wearable devices to improve their love life			1
last week the first marriage proposal using @entity3 was recorded at @entity210 in @entity211			0
whereas 63 per cent of @entity2 and 71 per cent of @entity52 respondents said that wearable technology has improved their health and fitness			1
the @entity46 study also revealed seven distinct profiles of people who use wearable technology			1
another example of wearable technology is smart watches			2
this mockup of the much - rumoured @entity222 was created by @entity223			0
it is expected to link to an @entity225 , and compete with @entity24 's @entity3 in the wearable computer market curious users have no particular health , fitness , food , mood or emotional need for wearable technology			1
they are simply interested in what happens when they ' play ' with these devices			0
controllers tend to see everything in their life as ' a selection of parts contributing towards an overall ecosystem			0
' they will only purchase the device once they know that it will do what they want it to do and they can manage their data the way that they want to the @entity254 wants to track everything they do			0
self medics use wearable devices to take control over health and well - being			0
@entity3 was hacked earlier this year			0
@entity262 , a tech blogger , tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with @entity3 , which led to experts warning ' private moments ' such as these could be seen by hackers			0
these reports have led to more than half of people asked in a recent study expressing serious privacy concerns about the device , and 69 per cent of @entity2 adults calling for more regulation self medics also often use multiple apps and devices to get an accurate account of their health			1
finish line fanatics love the idea of the device and are really excited at the start , yet once they realise it needs to be calibrated , charged , synced and sometimes needs them to manually add data , the shine wears off			0
to the @entity289 his phone is classed as a form of ‘ wearable tech ’ because he always has it on him , so he needs more from any other gadgets to make them all link together			0
and finally , the @entity296 users are children who will grow up with the next generation of wearable technology and not know any different			2
the respondents were also asked about future technologies			0
32 per cent of respondents said they are most excited about the arrival of nanotechnology such as microscopic ‘ robots ’ that could , for example , travel through blood and turn off cancer cells			0
29 per cent admitted they are excited about the introduction of bionic limbs , a common feature in movies such as @entity314 and @entity315			0
