he also forgets his place in his book as he repeats lines , but insists it was because someone had ' messed ' with his book			0
he even mispronounces words and adds his own spin on traditional phrases			0
at one point he loses his place in his notes , prompting the confused bride to mutter , ' could n't you just make it up ? ' when he finally gets to the end of the ceremony he announces : ' ladies and gentlemen , i give you great honour and great joy and privilege to announce to you , mr. and mrs. @entity56			0
the exasperated groom is then seen shrugging his shoulders - ' i 'm taking her name , ' he says the 27 - year - old bride describes the whole experience as ' mortifying			0
' ' he just dropped the ball completely , ' @entity64 told @entity66			0
' it seemed like ( it took ) an eternity			0
' the couple got engaged in february and in april they found @entity13 's post ' @entity73 , ' online			2
they paid him a $ 75 deposit on a total fee of $ 250 but the couple said when they suggested a dress rehearsal , @entity13 told them it was unnecessary			2
he also forgets his place in his book as he repeats lines to the bemused couple he even mispronounces words and adds his own spin on words @entity13 misplaces the rings , and then drops them as the couple become more perturbed by his behaviour following his conduct at the wedding , they were so incensed that they tried to contact him and he finally responded three days later with a text message in which he explained he should have done a rehearsal			1
he also refers to ' my heart diabetes , ' claiming he had a ' mild heart attack ' after the ceremony , and that he is ' truly sorry about that day			0
' the couple refused to pay @entity13 his entire fee after the ceremony , and demanded their deposit back which they did not receive			0
but this week they got a further shock when they received a call from @entity112 telling them @entity13 was not authorized to marry people in the province			1
the exasperated bride turns to look at her bridesmaids as the series of gaffes continue @entity13 asks the couple where the rings are - after already dropping them the @entity123 say they now have to go to family court and apply for an ' order of validity ' to finally make their marriage official , an ordeal @entity130 expects to cost ' about $ 500			2
' @entity131 , spokesperson for @entity112 , declined to speak specifically about the @entity133 case , but she told @entity66 couples such as the @entity135 are still considered legally married , but they must apply to the courts to ' determine that the marriage is valid ' before the province can recognize the union			1
it is a crime in @entity112 , to knowingly ' solemnize ' a marriage without the authority to do so			1
@entity13 told mr @entity9 via text message this week that he was certified by the ' @entity145 of @entity1 ' - the website states it will ' ordain ' people to perform marriages for $ 139.99			1
but the organization is not authorized to certify marriage officiants in @entity112 , @entity131 said			2
@entity13 did not return @entity66 's request for comment - and the @entity145 was unavailable for comment			0
