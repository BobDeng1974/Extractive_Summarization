she is rarely pictured without a beaming smile on her face as she goes about her royal duties			0
but yesterday the @entity4 was showing the strain of keeping up with her busy schedule at almost eight months pregnant			0
she looked pale and tired , with fine lines on her forehead , as she left an exclusive @entity10 hotel , and , unusually , failed to offer onlookers even the briefest of grins			0
nevertheless @entity4 , 33 , still showed off her impeccable style in a floral print dress , matched with navy @entity17 court shoes and an understated £ 255 @entity19			2
we were n't expecting to see the @entity4 today but here she is looking fresh as a daisy in a lovely floral print frock as she stepped out of the @entity25			2
this spring - ready dress is by @entity31 and is from the @entity10 based designer 's @entity41 collection			1
so not only is @entity4 rocking one of the coolest high end labels around but she 's still wearing regular fitting clothes , despite being seven months pregnant			2
how does she do it ? with fans in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity31 is now a regular feature on the red carpet and @entity4 's look today confirms just how into fashion she is			1
styled with her favorite navy blue suede @entity17 heels and a clutch by @entity58 , she 's the picture of elegance			0
and what you ca n't see is that the dress has a cute cut out at the back			0
gorgeous ! unfortunately it is no longer available to buy but if you click the link ( right ) you can take a look at the current collection at @entity32			0
for those who want to steal @entity4 's style for less we 've found some pretty prints that will do the trick			0
@entity77 's ' @entity76 ' dress is a dead ringer for the @entity31 original or check out @entity80 and @entity81 for similar styles			1
if the @entity4 is dressing for spring then we 've all got the royal seal of approval			0
@entity85 print dress visit site @entity89 floral print dress ( now reduced to $ 41.50 ) visit site little mistress floral print dress at @entity89 ( now reduced to £ 56 ) visit site @entity95 floral dress at @entity96 visit site she looked remarkably svelte , displaying her neat baby bump in the £ 995 @entity31 dress , which is not designed for pregnant women , as she left the lunchtime reception at the five - star @entity25			1
@entity4 's lunchtime foray was not part of her official schedule and , according to @entity108 , the 33 - year - old was attending in a private capacity , having received a personal invitation from the hotel			1
today 's visit is far from being the first time that the @entity4 has spent time at the @entity25			1
last december , the hotel was the venue for a meeting of the board of the @entity120 , the sailing charity of which the @entity4 is patron			0
she also stayed in the hotel , which is situated across the road from @entity125 , in the run - up to the @entity127 along with her parents and siblings @entity131 and @entity132			0
getting bigger : @entity22 , who is now seven months pregnant and is due to give birth in april , showed off a noticeably bigger bump no coat : @entity22 was without a coat and chose to brave the cold in nothing more than her patterned silk dress other royals to love the @entity10 hotel include the queen mother who apparently considered it her favourite and used the @entity145 , which first opened its doors in 1910 , as the venue for her last public appearance in 2002			1
today 's visit to the @entity25 was the @entity4 ' first public outing in two weeks , with her last official visit coming when she travelled to the @entity152 in @entity153 to tour the @entity155 factory			1
during that trip , during which she wore a @entity159 dress , a @entity161 coat and her trademark £ 395 @entity164 satin shoes , the @entity4 tried her hand at making plates and was declared a natural by local potters			0
she also used the occasion to visit the @entity170 in @entity171 , where she joined a group of youngsters who were trying their hand at crafts courtesy of a couple of old tin cans and some colourful feathers			0
@entity22 , an art fan herself , promptly rolled up her sleeves and got stuck in before declaring , as she made her way back to her waiting car : ' @entity183 would have loved this ! ' @entity183 's father , the @entity23 , is currently touring @entity186 and spent his second evening in the country making a speech in @entity189 , following a historic meeting with @entity186 's president @entity191 in @entity192			1

the @entity23 then flew out of @entity192 and on to the coastal city - and former @entity228 stronghold - of @entity189 , where he helped launch the @entity252 , a government - inspired scheme intended to promote @entity228 business			1

' ' it is a platform not only for our famed and still thriving creative sectors , such as film , art and media , ' he continued			0
' but it is also a platform for the creativity and inventiveness that @entity228 firms apply in a wide variety of sectors , like healthcare and education			0

' this morning in @entity192 as i was warmly welcomed by president @entity191 in the @entity219 before visiting the @entity239 , i was given the chance to appreciate first - hand that @entity186 and @entity228 are united in our experience as countries with a proud and ancient history			2
