a team of archaeologists are toasting their latest find - a ' microbrewery ' dating back some 3,500 years			1
the two metres by two metres mud - plaster domed structure , which the group says was used as a kiln to dry malt and make beer , was found in western @entity6			1
beers of different flavours would have been brewed from malted barley and fermented with yeasts with an alcoholic content of around 5 per cent - much the same as a modern day beer			1
the yeast would have either been wild or produced from fruit such as grape or fig , according to the researchers			0
dr @entity30 , from the @entity31 , who has led the excavation at the @entity34 settlement of @entity35 , near @entity36 , since 2007 , said : ' archaeologists believe beer drinking was an important part of society from the @entity41 onwards and may have even been the main reason that people began to cultivate grain in the first place			1
' but it 's extremely rare to find the remains of production preserved from thousands of years ago so we 're very excited			2
' the excavation of the malting kiln with associated sets of pottery types and tools left in place gives us a fantastic opportunity to look at @entity5 tool kits and figure out techniques and recipes			2
' the discovery was found at one end of a 50 metre square courtyard with a plastered floor			2
as well as the ' microbrewery ' , the group also found grinding tools and mortars which may have been used to break down the grain after it was malted , a small hearth and cooking pots made of clay said to have been used to cook the beer gently			1
they also found juglets , which they believe probably contained yeast additives or sweeteners to produce beers of different strengths or flavours			0
the beers ' ingredients were found by the team as carbonised seeds			2
the malting kiln seen in the far end of a large courtyard with plastered floor from @entity35			0
dr @entity30 added : ' beer was commonly drunk because it is more nutritious than bread and less likely to contain harmful pathogens than drinking water which can make you ill. ' but alcoholic beverages were also used to oil the wheels of business and pleasure in much the same way as today			1
work brought communities together for tasks such as bringing in the harvest or erecting special buildings			0
' instead of payment , participants are rewarded with a special feast , often involving quantities of alcohol which also transformed the work from a chore into a social event			0
' the people of the @entity5 , it seems , were well aware of the relaxing properties of alcohol			0
' success : the team of archaeologists from the @entity31 pictured working on site in western @entity6 an experimental archaeology team , led by @entity124 , recreated the drying kiln using traditional techniques to test dr @entity30 's theory in august , said the university			1
the modern version used hot air to produce a temperature of @entity134 - perfect conditions for heating and drying grains but still preserving its enzymes and proteins			0
and mr @entity139 said that the beers produced were n't half bad			0
he said : ' after the beers had been strained , we felt they were all pretty drinkable , though some varieties were better than others			0
' the grape was less pleasant - a bit too sweet - the outcomes are less reliable when using wild yeasts , compared to brewer 's yeast , but the fig beer was definitely the most popular			2

the team from the @entity31 made the rare discovery in western @entity6
the mud - plaster domed structure was used as a kiln to make beer
