when @entity1 was making his way in cricket he would think of the @entity4 as the ultimate			1
‘ it is one of those lifelong dreams , ’ he said			2
‘ you see the @entity4 as a kid and you think , " that ’s where i want to be , that ’s the stage i want to perform on			2
’ it would be everything			2
who knew this is where i ’d be today ? ' i kept faith through injuries and ups and downs and always had my eyes on the prize			1
hopefully i ’m in a position now to claim that prize			2
’ @entity1 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity29 's @entity28 during the odi in may in the absence of @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 , @entity1 will be hoping to seize his chance it is within touching distance for a gifted all - rounder who has arrived in @entity39 ’s new era via the unconventional route of a childhood in @entity42 before making his life in @entity39 through a scholarship at @entity45			1
but first comes a one - day series in @entity29 that will make or break that dream for @entity1 , who will be given the perfect chance to claim his @entity4 place in the absence of the injured @entity32 and @entity33			1
the man who has shown glimpses of enormous potential in his first year of international cricket but also inconsistency knows that something will have to give and someone will have to miss out when the spearheads return			2
so , in effect , he has seven matches in @entity29 , along with the likes of @entity61 , @entity62 and perhaps even @entity63 , to prove that he should be on the plane to @entity65 in january			1
the @entity39 attack is very much on trial			2
‘ everyone is talking about the @entity4 but for me it ’s about staying in the moment , ’ @entity1 told @entity68			1
‘ we are a new side and are still getting to know each other			2
we need to start winning in @entity29 to put ourselves in a good position for the @entity4			1
i ’ve enjoyed every minute of playing for @entity39 and international cricket is everything i expected it to be			2
’ @entity1 ( right ) , in action for @entity79 , celebrates bowling out @entity80 in the @entity81 but he is far from fully established yet			1
there have been the highs of his superlative all - round performance on his home ground in @entity86 against @entity87 in a @entity89 international ; his demolition of @entity29 in a one - day international at @entity91 and his seven wickets in the final test against @entity94			1
yet there have also been lows , in particularly the third test at the @entity98 last summer and the one - day international in @entity100 against @entity94 when his radar went awry and @entity1 looked anything like a leading @entity39 bowler			1
‘ i ’m trying to be a world - class player , a great player , so i have to get better with both balls , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i could n’t put my finger on what went wrong at @entity109			0
i ’d just come from a game at @entity111 for @entity79 where i ’d bowled well and taken a few wickets			2
' it was just one of those things			0
the first ball just did n’t come out right and it set the tone for the rest of the day			0
but as the series went on i got better and better and finished strongly so i ’ve drawn a line under @entity109 and do n’t think about it any more			0
’ @entity1 bowls during a nets session at @entity123 in september 2013 @entity1 ( second right ) celebrates taking the wicket of @entity126 of @entity29 at @entity127 last june it is the stuttering run - up of @entity129 ’s that the purists questioned when he was prone to bowling wides last summer , particularly of someone who is such a brilliant athlete			1
it was born out of necessity when he spent a year on the sidelines with a serious back injury and he has no plans to tinker with it just yet			0
‘ i actually used to run in a lot faster and from quite a way back but after coming back for injury i worked on a more measured approach for consistency , ’ said @entity1			1
my head is a lot more still and i can really focus on my target			0
it ’s something that works for me but equally you ’re always looking to evolve and get better so if that ’s an area i can eventually make a little bit more efficient it ’s something i ’m more than happy to work on			0
‘ everyone is n’t the same and different things work for different people so you have to have a strong character because that ’s what ’s got me here in the first place			0
but it ’s my first season in international cricket and everything is not always rosy			0
i have been working on the negatives and keep improving			0
‘ i want to bowl quickly and add a few miles on to it			0
i think i can be over 90 miles per hour consistently , not just the odd ball here and there , but to do that i have to make sure my body is in top condition			0
’ @entity1 prepares to make a spectacular catch during a practice session at @entity174 in @entity175 in july his run up served him well enough when he got everything right last summer			1
‘ @entity42 was one of the highlights for sure , ’ he said			0
‘ i had n’t played on that tour since the first game in @entity182 and it was the first time my family had been able to watch me playing for @entity39 , around 15 or 20 of them			0
it could n’t have been written any better and i enjoyed the moment with all of them			0
’ he will be back in @entity42 for @entity189 after the @entity29 tour when he hopes to catch up with his old friend from @entity192 in @entity86 , the singer @entity193			1
‘ i have n’t seen her since i started playing for @entity39 but i like to think she ’s still a friend and i hope to see her then , ’ he added			0
but first there is a @entity4 place to earn			0
@entity1 says he is trying to become a world - class player as he prepares to take on @entity29 @entity1 is the ambassador of @entity199 one of the @entity201 ’s fastest growing retail fund management companies : @entity202			1

@entity1 looking to *capitalise* on injuries to @entity32 and @entity33
@entity1 has seven matches in @entity29 to prove that he should be on the plane to @entity65
@entity1 took seven wickets in the final test against @entity94 last summer
