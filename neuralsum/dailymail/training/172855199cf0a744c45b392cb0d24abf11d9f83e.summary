by @entity0 when @entity2 found that her three - year old son had cut through the wire of her mobile phone charger , she did not react as most other parents would			1
instead of being cross with him and telling him never to do such a thing again , @entity7 simply said : ' wow , you really do want to cut through things ! ' and give him a bag of other things to chop up			0
a week after the head of schools inspection body @entity14 said that all young children should be able to understand the word ' no ' , self - styled parenting expert @entity7 went on this morning to defend what she calls ' @entity21			1
they can watch television all night if they want to and eat ice - cream for breakfast			2
' i was a supernanny type of mother to begin with , ' said mother - of - two @entity7			1
' there were lots of rules and regulations and i was always saying no. then for six weeks i did n't say no to them at all and it was just so different			0
' this was too much for this morning presenter @entity44 , who is currently pregnant with her third child			2
' i dread to think what would happen if i said yes to my children all the time ! ' she gasped			2
@entity2 and @entity49 clashed on the @entity51 sofa over whether to always say yes to children when @entity7 's child cut her phone charger wire , she simply went and collected a whole load of things with a similar shape and feel for him to cut through in future			1
' but did n't you tell him that he should n't ever cut through wires in future ? ' asked @entity62			0
' it 's incredibly dangerous			0
' ' they could die , ' added @entity65 , looking concerned			0
' i do n't think i did , ' replied @entity7			0
' my response is instead to be there all the time for them			0
i think instead of saying no to children all the time we need to equip them with the knowledge of what boundaries are appropriate			1
' however parenting expert @entity49 said that children needed boundaries			1
' it is not unkind to them to say no and can be very useful			0
' ' if they do n't learn discipline and boundaries and the word ' no ' at home then it 's going to be very difficult for them at school or in later life			2
one day someone 's going to say no and they 're going to have no idea how to react to that			0
' parenting expert and author @entity49 argued that children needed boundaries or life could be very difficult @entity7 admitted that she might have been too harsh a parent before and might have now gone too far the other way			1
' as a personality i tend not to find the middle ground , ' she said			0
however she claimed that her children were very well - behaved			1
' people tell me they are a joy to be around , ' she said			0
but @entity49 pointed out that children are too young to set their own boundaries			1
' we have a culture of society which is scared about letting children be children , ' she said , ' but statisically children who lack structure and discipline have a much higher likelihood of getting into problems in life with drink and drugs			2
' some viewers took to twitter afterwards to condemn @entity7 's lax attitude to parenting			2
one person wrote that @entity122 was ' just an excuse to be a bad parent and not care ' while another said that @entity122 meant ' more work for teachers and the police later on ' .			1

mother - of - two @entity2 believes you should never say no to your child
is an *advocate* of ' @entity122 ' meaning she never says ' no ' to her kids
her children decide when when go to bed and if they do their homework
but parenting expert @entity49 says that children need boundaries
