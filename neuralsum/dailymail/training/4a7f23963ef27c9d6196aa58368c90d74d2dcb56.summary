by @entity0 dreading the big reveal on the beach ? so was i , until i discovered this summer ’s answer to wobbly thighs , stretch marks and bulging love handles : the skirtini			1
as the name suggests , it ’s not a skirt , it ’s not a bikini — it ’s both : swimwear that comes with a little skirt attached to skim over lumpy thighs and cover wobbly bottoms			1
many are all - in - one swimsuits which incorporate extra fabric into the design but there are also tankini tops that come with briefs that are not so brief thanks to a nifty skirt overlay			1
even bikinis can be skirtinis — you get the same bra top , but the skirted bottom gives extra coverage just where you need it			2
but be warned : the length of the skirt and the cut of the top has to be just perfect to flatter — but get it right and a well - chosen skirtini will totally transform how you look — and feel — on the beach this summer			1
the frilly bit skims the top of the thighs nicely but did n’t cover my entire bottom and sadly the padded top squashed my boobs , so not so great for anyone over a d cup			1
score : 3/5 @entity57 swimsuit in navy with cream bow , £ 89 , samanthasage.com an elegant , classic design in forgiving navy that miraculously enhances curves without resorting to tummy control panels or underwiring			2
instead , it ’s cleverly cut with a short , playful , frill that is perfectly positioned to give an hourglass silhouette			2
it ’s very comfortable , too , and i feel great in it			2
score : 5/5 @entity72 birds of paradise tankini top , £ 40 matching skirt £ 26 , @entity75 a fun pattern and skirt is really flattering , covering the bottom without hiding too much leg			1
but as soon as i put the top on , i looked more like i was heading to a tennis court than a swimming pool			2
the top is way too long and loose			0
score : 2/5 @entity85 swim dress , £ 49 , @entity86 ladies , throw away your sarongs			0
in this flirty swim dress , everything ’s covered			0
you wo n’t get much of a tan wearing it but if you ’re going to a beach wedding or party , you wo n’t need to change when you fancy a dip ! not for serious lane swimming but for posing poolside , it ’s a winner			0
@entity55 : 4.5/5 sea by @entity100 swim dress , £ 45 , @entity101 a @entity102 for the beach			0
you could wear this from beach to bar and vice versa			0
the skirt hides the tops of the thighs and the gold detail on the halterneck adds a little dazzle without looking too @entity115			1
it lacks a little in boob support and waist definition but it ’s very comfortable			0
@entity55 : 3.5/5 @entity120 halter neck top & matching skirted brief both , £ 32 , @entity123 if you thought your bikini days were over , think again			1
this blue skirtini with mini polka dots hides the mummy tummy perfectly			1
the underwired bra top , in bra sizes up to an h cup , is flattering and feminine as well as comfortable			0
i love the colour and the frills			0
it makes me feel years younger			0

the skirtini is swimwear with a little skirt attached
skirt skims lumpy thighs and covers wobbly bottoms
available as a one - piece , tankini and a bikini
