they could be hear chirping from the roadside reaching out : the ducklings had no way out of the deep drain			2
officers were careful not to frighten the birds as they reached for them as they could move further down the drain and become harder to retrieve she said : ' my dad picked up the duckling and handed it to me - hoping the mother duck would follow and we could take them to the park			1
' however , she just wandered back to a drain on the roadside			2

' mr @entity56 called @entity6 to rescue the animals			0
@entity6 officer @entity58 attended the scene but was unable to remove the drain grille himself and called the fire service			2
@entity32 's white watch manager @entity62 said : ' we were able to use our tools to lift up the drain and gain access to the ducklings			2

the tiny ducks were wrapped in towels ( right ) and cared for by @entity6 officers joining forces : the rescue team praised the @entity13 family for contacting the @entity6 and waiting for expert help instead of trying to reach the birds themselves ' we helped fish the ducklings out one by one and put them into a basket provided by the @entity6			1
' it took us about 45 minutes to get all 12 ducklings out of the drain			1
' the @entity6 called us for assistance and @entity13 's family did the right thing to get in touch with the animal experts first before trying to rescue the ducklings themselves			1
' i have had first hand experience at how dangerous even drains can be as i chopped off the tip of my finger in one when younger			0
' inspector @entity58 said : ' sadly every year we receive a number of calls regarding ducklings falling down drains			0
