by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has hit back at @entity3 after the @entity5 manager blamed the club 's former owner for their recent demise			1
the @entity9 were relegated from the @entity10 in may , after 13 seasons , and a poor start to life in the @entity14 saw fans of the club calling for the manager to be sacked			1
@entity3 told the @entity18 ' had not spent money ' , despite injecting around Â£ 200million into the club in 16 years to take them to the @entity10			1
he also claimed , under @entity2 's ownership , @entity5 ' sold the best players and brought in average players			1
you can not go on doing that for a long time			2
' changing hands : @entity28 ( right ) bought @entity5 from @entity2 ( left ) in 2013 torrid time : @entity3 has overseen @entity5 's awful start to the @entity14 season however , @entity2 has described suggestions he is to blame as ' absurd ' and was keen to point the finger back at @entity33 and ' absentee landlord ' @entity28 , who he sold the club to last year			1
writing in his column for the @entity18 on friday , @entity2 said : ' what an odd man @entity3 is			1
i am not talking about the way he jumps around in the technical area when things go wrong on the pitch and then appeals to the dugout as if the physio and team doctor had caused it			2
' no , what 's strange is that after losing @entity5 's first four games of the @entity14 season , he has got time to criticise me - someone he has never met - instead of devoting every waking second to putting right his own glaring mistakes			1
' there is nothing dishonourable about failure , if you face up to it			2
mr @entity3 is n't the first foreign coach to find the @entity60 game hard			1
what is wrong , and frankly un-english , is to blame someone else instead of taking responsibility for your own actions			2
humiliation : @entity5 were beaten 5 - 1 at @entity67 in their last game and are now bottom of the league hitting back : @entity2 has described suggestions he is to blame for club 's demise as ' absurd ' ' i sold my beloved @entity5 on july 13 , 2013			1
if a week is a long time in politics , 13 months is a lifetime in football			0
mr @entity3 was brought in to stave off relegation from the @entity10 but instead presided over a meek surrender			2
' it broke my heart			0
after 16 years at the helm at @entity82 , to see my work destroyed in a season was a bitter experience			0
to be blamed for that failure , is absurd			2
' fortunately , there are 25,000 people who know the truth			0
i am content to be judged by them			0
' @entity2 also insisted he spent money in the best interests of the club , who saw their best years under his ownership as they reached the final of the @entity98 in 2010			1
' we played our part in making it the best and most entertaining league in the world			0
@entity5 achieved their highest ever top - flight finish , seventh , ' he wrote			2
under pressure : @entity5 boss @entity3 is in desperate need for his side to start picking up points outraged : @entity2 insisted he spent money in the best interests of the club ' we carried @entity60 prestige into the inaugural season of the @entity98 , taking @entity115 into extra-time in the final and within five minutes of a penalty shoot - out			1
' mr @entity3 says i bought only average players ? so who were the men playing that night in @entity122 ? i 'll tell you : titans of the game and every one a hero			2
' in football , you can not be an absentee landlord , as i fear @entity28 is most of the time			1
i went on the pitch before games			0
i talked to the players			0
yes , they are paid a lot of money but they are still young men who need inspiration			0
people work for people , not anonymous boards of directors			0
i gave the players gold chocolate bars from @entity146			0
if they needed to try harder , i handed out blue peppermints and said they were @entity150			0
' those players never let me down			0
misery : @entity5 's @entity152 looks dejected as the west @entity154 side lose 1 - 0 against @entity155 ' the personal touch is important			1
every manager i chose tried to take @entity5 forward			1
two of them became @entity60 managers			0
' he added : ' when i was young , there was a cartoon character , @entity166			0
whatever happened to him - whether he was run over on the road to @entity168 or blown up with dynamite - he just kept on walking			0
' if @entity5 's results do not improve , starting with @entity172 tomorrow , perhaps this particular @entity3 should follow that cat down the road to @entity168 and then just keep on walking			1

@entity5 manager @entity3 had blamed former owner for club 's demise
