’ dr @entity45 , 55 , who still works at the hospital , was one of two defendants at the hearing although he was tried only by a criminal prosecutor hired by @entity8 ’s family			2
@entity51 , a 37 - year - old drug addict accused of beating up the biology graduate outside @entity5 ’s famous @entity54 nightclub on august 26 2006 , was also tried for manslaughter by a state lawyer as well as the lawyer acting for the dead man ’s family			1

mrs @entity32 , from @entity63 near @entity63 , @entity64 , fought back tears as she told the hearing : ‘ @entity8 and @entity61 were trying to get a taxi to come back to our holiday apartment after their night out			1
‘ @entity8 said he was told by someone milling round the car park that one parked car was a taxi and to get in the back			2
‘ he was sat in the back waiting to go when a guy got in and started beating him round the head			0

@entity51 , a 37 - year - old drug addict accused of beating up the biology graduate outside @entity5 's famous @entity54 nightclub on august 26 2006 , was also tried for manslaughter by a state lawyer as well as the lawyer acting for the dead man 's family @entity21 doctor @entity92 told the court specialist @entity20 agreed to come to the hospital after @entity8 suffered two nose bleeds and tests showed his haemoglobin level had dropped to 10.4 , well below the normal reading for a man his age , and which should have been around 14			1
but he was sent home after having his nose packed by dr @entity45 during a 15 - minute examination - despite experts insisting at a september 2007 inquest into @entity8 ’s death in the @entity3 that the blood tests results were ‘ red light ’ warnings of heavy blood loss			1
he died from an upper airway haemorrhage the following day after collapsing at his holiday apartment and being rushed back to the same hospital			2
@entity116 , prosecuting for the family , criticised dr @entity45 for failing to ‘ follow protocol ’ by discharging @entity8 without detecting the source of the bleed and said the hospital should have done more blood tests before sending him home			1

‘ @entity8 died from a simple nose bleed , ’ he said			2

’ @entity157 , a doctor the lawyer called as a witness , added : ‘ packing the front of the nose when the problem is a leak behind the nose is like putting a bandage on your right hand when it ’s your left hand that ’s bleeding			0
‘ if i had n’t detected the source of the bleed , i would have been more prudent and kept the patient in observation overnight rather than sending him home			0
‘ the root problem was n’t attacked sufficiently , the tap was left open and the tragic outcome was @entity8 ’s death			2

the action i took that day was the action i have continued to take every time i see someone with a nose bleed			0
