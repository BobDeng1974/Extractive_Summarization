@entity0 is being sued with @entity1 and the @entity2 by 14 @entity4 countries demanding what could be hundreds of billions of pounds in reparations for slavery			1
around 175 years after @entity0 freed its last slaves in the @entity11 , an alliance of @entity4 nations is demanding to be repaid for the ' awful ' , lingering legacy of the @entity14 slave trade			1
@entity15 , a group of 12 former @entity0 colonies together with the former @entity1 colony @entity18 and the @entity2 - held @entity19 , believes the @entity21 governments should pay – and the @entity0 in particular			1
legal action : @entity0 , @entity1 and the @entity2 are being sued by 14 @entity4 countries for what could be billions of pounds in reparations for slavery , illustrated here in this 1861 drawing of a chain gang ' awful legacy ' : in a speech at @entity33 last month ( above ) , prime minister of @entity30 and the @entity31 , @entity29 , said @entity21 nations must pay for the slave trade it has hired the @entity0 law firm @entity38 , which recently won compensation for hundreds of @entity40 tortured by the @entity0 colonial government during the @entity43 rebellion of the 1950s			1
@entity15 has not specified how much money they are seeking but senior officials have pointed out that @entity0 paid slave owners £ 20 million when it abolished slavery in 1834			1
that sum would be the equivalent of £ 200 billion today			2
in the @entity52 , the idea of reparations has surfaced a number of times over the years , but have never been paid out			1
at the end of the @entity60 , around 400,000 acres of land in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 were taken from former slave owners and earmarked for freed slaves			1
' @entity0 will be at the forefront of this claim , ' says day enthusiastically			2
' we undoubtedly face more claims than others because we were the primary colonial power in the @entity4 and primary operators of the slave trade ' migration : a map shows the main transatlantic routes out of @entity74 during the slave trade from 1500 - 1900 a look back : a map depicts the slave and non-slaveholding states at the outbreak of the @entity60 , along with the dates when each non-slaveholding state legally ended slavery @entity85 traders built @entity74 's first permanent slave trading post at @entity87 in 1492			1
it passed into @entity2 and @entity90 hands and by the 18th century they shipped tens of thousands of @entity91 a year through ' the door of no return ' onto squalid slave ships bound for plantations of the @entity96			0
@entity21 traders would sail to the west coast of @entity74 with manufactured goods which they exchanged for people captured by @entity91 traders			0
the @entity21 merchants would then cross the @entity14 with ships full of slaves on the notorious ' @entity105 '			2
conditions were so torrid that many of the captors , who often had barely any space to move , did not survive the journey			0
those who made the voyage were destined to work on plantations that produced products such as sugar or tobacco for consumption back in @entity21			0
by the end of the 18th century , campaigners called for the abolition of the trade , but this was fiercely opposed because it was so profitable			0
after years of campaigning by anti-slavery activists like politician @entity126 , @entity0 banned the trade in slaves from @entity74 on march 25 , 1807			1
slavery itself was not outlawed by @entity0 for another generation , in 1833 , and the transatlantic trade continued under foreign flags for many years			1
some estimates say as many as 60million people were shipped into bondage			0
but the decision was reversed by president @entity137 after president @entity139 's assassination in 1865 , it was noted by @entity140			0
in 2008 , @entity141 said he did not support reparations to the descendants of slaves , going against the views of around two dozen members of @entity147 who sponsored legislation to create a commission on slavery			0
in the same year , the @entity151 apologised for slavery , with the @entity153 following suit in 2009 , but neither mentioned compensation			0
in its lawsuit , @entity15 claims slavery condemned the region to a poverty that still afflicts it today			0
and they are comparing their demand to @entity163 recompensing @entity165 people for the @entity166 and @entity167 compensating @entity168			0
' the awful legacy of these crimes against humanity ought to be repaired for the developmental benefit of our @entity4 societies and all our peoples , ' said @entity29 , the prime minister of the tiny @entity30 and the @entity31			1
he called it a ' historic wrong that has to be righted '			0
@entity178 , who is coordinating @entity180 ’s demands for reparations , said their slave ancestors ' got nothing ' when they were freed			2
' they got their freedom and they were told ‘ go develop yourselves ’ , ' she said			0
critics have pointed out that many of @entity15 ’s members are hardly poor – including millionaire havens such as the @entity193 and @entity194			0
prime minister @entity195 expressed regret for the ' unbearable suffering ' caused by @entity0 ’s role in slavery in 2007 but made no mention of financial compensation			1
@entity0 has said that paying reparations for slavery is the wrong way to address ' an historical problem '			1
the scheme has been drawn up by @entity0 lawyer @entity38 who pursued claims on behalf of @entity40 @entity43 veterans , which resulted in payments to 5,228 survivors of £ 19.9 ¿ million of @entity0 taxpayers ' money for their alleged suffering during the @entity215 uprising against @entity0 rule @entity15 insists they are hoping to reach a settlement with the @entity21 countries and will only take legal action if talks collapse			1
a @entity15 reparations commission has been set up to work out should be paid and how much , led by @entity194 historian sir @entity222			2
sir @entity222 says they are ' focusing ' on @entity0 because it was the largest slave owner in the 1830s			2
' the @entity0 made the most money out of slavery and the slave trade - they got the lion ’s share			1
and , importantly , they knew how to convert slave profits into industrial profits , ' he said			0
some @entity15 countries already get financial aid from @entity0 and other @entity238 countries			2
@entity38 , the @entity0 lawyer who is advising @entity15 , told the @entity239 he doubted it would affect their membership of the @entity238			2
' i know they are hoping they can resolve this amicably rather than having to take matters through the courts , ' he said			0
he said : ' our advice has been that the @entity4 states should be claiming in relation to the impact of the slave trade on the @entity4 today rather than looking for reparations related to what happened to the slaves historically			1

countries demanding compensation for ' awful ' legacy of @entity14 trade
have hired lawyers who won pay - out for @entity40 tortured in the 1950s
@entity0 compensated slave owners £ *20m* in 1834 - equal to £ 200bn today
idea of reparations in the @entity52 has often surfaced , but none has been paid
