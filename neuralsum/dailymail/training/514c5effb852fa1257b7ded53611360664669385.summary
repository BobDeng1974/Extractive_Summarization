ten years ago , @entity0 walked into the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 as an olympian but tantalised by the lure of professional boxing and the fickle riches it promises			1
now , just two days on from the 10th anniversary of that first visit to the @entity10 , he steps into a vegas ring determined to finally fulfil his dream of becoming a world champion			2
at the @entity16 of @entity2 arena , the 30 - year - old @entity15 middleweight takes on fellow southpaw @entity18 , a 31 - year - old @entity19 , for the vacant @entity21 world championship			1
@entity0 is hoping to realise his dream of becoming a world champion on his return to @entity2 a decade on from being invited to watch @entity25 ’s heavyweight title defence against @entity26 by former trainer @entity27 , the @entity15 native may live up to his old coach ’s predictions after an eight - and - a - half year pro career			1
hailed by the late and legendary @entity27 as his ‘ left - handed @entity32 ’ , @entity0 was tipped as a champion in waiting from the day he moved to @entity35 ’s @entity34 , eventually making his pro debut in march , 2006			1
having gone unbeaten in 15 fights , a surprise 2008 loss to @entity40 @entity39 upset his original title plans before the defeat was avenged three years later			0
but a seventh - round 2012 stoppage loss to then @entity44 champion @entity43 in his first title shot — with @entity0 halted on his feet — made many question @entity27 ’s predication			1
‘ it ’s gone fast but it ’s been good and it ’s all been necessary to get me to this point , ’ says @entity0 on his 33 - 2 career			1
‘ all those experiences and all those years are needed physically and mentally to get to the point where i am now			2
i feel it ’s the right time			0
‘ it ’s almost 10 years ago to the day that i came here first to @entity2 as a guest with @entity27			1
ten years later , here i am , i ’m going to fight for the world title so it ’s been good in a roundabout way			2
it ’s been 10 years and it ’s time to do it			0
’ his determination to seize the moment is bolstered by the confidence he has gained since coming under the tutelage of @entity68 , who trained @entity69 to become unified cruiserweight world champion and later @entity72 heavyweight champion			1
@entity19 @entity18 knocks out @entity73 during their @entity2 bout in 2009 during his rebuilding process after the loss to @entity43 , @entity0 ’s form was hard to judge with two knockout wins over weak opposition bookended by sluggish points wins over middling fighters			1
his most recent victory , however — a fifth - round knockout of @entity85 ( son of two - weight world champ @entity87 ) — not only became an internet sensation , it also suggested @entity0 ’s ability had not wavered despite the fact that @entity85 had earlier put him on the canvas for the first time in his career			1
‘ i feel like i ’m boxing better than i ever have — like a seasoned professional , ’ says the 30 - year - old			1
‘ i ’m still young enough to have the hunger and the enthusiasm , especially since i ’ve been two years with @entity68			2
it ’s been a new challenge for me and it ’s really refreshed me			0
going to the gym every day and not knowing what i ’m [ going to be ] doing , learning and improving every day			0
i ’m in my prime — if not now than never			0
‘ a lot of it [ the slow rebuilding process ] was intentional because i was still learning and it was a whole new thing training with @entity68 so i had to adjust to that so time was needed			2
this is the right time for me to fight and become a world champion			2
’ standing in his way is the undefeated @entity18 ( 24 - 0 ) , a former two - time amateur world champion			1
a pugilistic paradox which makes the fight so unpredictable is the fact that , since turning pro in 2008 , @entity18 has yet to fight any opposition comparable to that which he faced as an amateur			2
‘ he is a good boxer			0
i know he has n’t been that sensational [ as a pro ] but he ’s beaten everybody he ’s fought and has amateur pedigree , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ but i believe i have better basics than him			0
i ’ve developed as a professional more so than he has			0
if anything , he ’s gone backwards , he ’s not the fighter he was as an amateur or at that level , comparatively as a professional			0
i see a good fighter but i do n’t see one who can box consistently for 12 rounds			0
@entity0 and trainer @entity68 work out ahead of their world title fight ‘ he has n’t fought a really meaningful fight that he has a good chance of losing , so that ’s going to play on his mind			1
i ’ve been in this situation so many times before where the outcome of the fight is uncertain			0
he ’s going to find it to be his first really hard fight as a professional and i ’m going to ask a lot of questions of him that he has n’t been asked yet			0
‘ my aim is to match him all the way in the early rounds , be there with him , box him and come on strong going down the stretch			0
‘ that ’s the way i see the fight going , ’ says @entity0 , hinting at the bout going the distance , but adds : ‘ he might try to come out and make a statement and try to bang me out of it and if he does , i ’ll look forward to that because i ’ll bang straight with him and whoever comes out of it will come out of it			1
my chin is proven and my power is proven			0
