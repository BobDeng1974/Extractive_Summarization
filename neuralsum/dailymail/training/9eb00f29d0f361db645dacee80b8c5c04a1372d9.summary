by @entity0 a sea of foam has covered a coastal town in a white blanket of bubbles whipped up by huge waves			1
as scattered wind , rain and floods hit the rest of the country , the seaside town of @entity13 , in @entity14 , has been overtaken by the snow - like covering			1
it comes as @entity19 forecasters predict an unsettled week of sunshine and showers as the remnants of @entity24 head north , for @entity25			1
the combination of one of the month 's highest tides , along with high winds , meant that for around an hour gallons of foam was blown in shore			1
the blizzard - like effect actually drew many hundreds of onlookers , as well as people wanting to drive through the foam			1
who photographed the images , said : ' it only happens once or twice a year and on this occasion there was a lot more foam than usual			0
' lots of people arrived to drive through it , but goodness knows what the foam would do to their engines			0
' the @entity19 has warned of an unsettled picture for the rest of the week and into the weekend - with a brief respite of sunshine on thursday			1
temperatures will be in the early 20s today - but winds and heavy showers sweeping across the @entity75 will make it feel much cooler , a spokesman said			1
he added : ' wednesday will be a drier day			0
there will still be a few showers , but it will perhaps feel a touch warmer , with a west and south west air flow			1
' there will be top temperatures of @entity85 in @entity86 tomorrow , and also a drier day in @entity25			1
' by thursday most places will see quite a decent day , with dry spells			0
but in the southwest it will be quite a wet day throughout the day			0

some showers in the east , drier in the west - a mixed day of sunshine and showers			1
' saturday looks mainly dry with light rain showers , but very few and far between			2
but sunday will be a bit more unsettled and very blustery in places			2
' the recent storms have led to a glut in hedgerow fruits , particularly sloes , which have already started appearing in abundance ahead of the @entity124			0
the soaking has ‘ tricked ’ blackthorn trees into thinking the autumn has already arrived			0
as a result they have begun hurriedly producing fruits before the first frosts arrive			0
sloes are prized by foragers , who mix them with gin and sugar and leave the infusion for several months to create a sweet liqueur			0
@entity140 and amber : the @entity142 had 28 flood warnings and 39 flood alerts in place for @entity146 and @entity147 the @entity148 at sunrise from @entity150 , north @entity86 , showed a bright start to the day			2
but the @entity19 has warned of a mixed outlook for today and into the week a view of the sunrise from @entity150 , @entity86			1
the @entity19 has warned of an unsettled picture for @entity146 and @entity147 for the rest of the week and into the weekend experts are now heralding a vintage year for foraging with other hedgerow fruits like blackberries , haws and rosehips also enjoying bumper crops			1
@entity162 , a foraging expert and @entity165 ’s right - hand man , said : ' the first sloes are out about four weeks early this year			1
' nature tends to follow the weather rather than by the calendar and that ’s exactly what has happened here			0
' we had a mild winter followed by a hot and dry summer but recently we ’ve had a bit of rain and a dip in temperatures			2
' blackthorn trees have been tricked into thinking it is autumn and that frosts are on their way so they have started producing sloes already			0
' the rain gave the trees a boost and fired them into production mode			0
a view of @entity190 on the horizon at sunrise			0
temperatures will reach @entity85 in @entity86 today - but will feel much cooler , forecasters say city workers walking along @entity196 toward the station during a rain shower on monday			1
the unsettled picture is set to continue into the weekend ' we tend to think of sloes being an autumn thing and some people wait until after the first frosts in november to pick them			2
' but this year we ’ll be able to get a head start			2
' it is looking like it is going to be a bumper year for sloes and other hedgerow fruits like haws and rosehips so foragers will be very happy			0
' blackthorn trees - @entity214 in @entity216 - are often used to form hedges because of their prickly thorns			2
they flower in spring and sloe berries usually start to emerge around mid-september			0
sloes are members of the same family as plums , cherries and peaches .			0
