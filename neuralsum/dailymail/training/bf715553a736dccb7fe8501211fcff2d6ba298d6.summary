as @entity1 trains his sights on records set by @entity5 legends such as @entity6 , it is hard to imagine he could have played for @entity7 ; harder still to think he might have been a goalkeeper , or that @entity5 nearly let him go			1
@entity1 has 17 goals this season and is scoring at a rate that puts him on course to be the first @entity5 player since @entity13 , 23 years ago , to break the 30 barrier			1
his personal target was amended from 10 to 20 just before @entity16			0
‘ i always want to progress and hopefully i will do that this year , ’ he shrugged with modesty after scoring two , setting up another and winning a penalty in a 5 - 3 win against @entity21 on thursday			1
@entity1 has been in sensational form for @entity5 - most recently netting a double against the @entity24 @entity25 ( right ) celebrates with the in - form @entity5 forward after scoring their fifth goal of the afternoon @entity1 and team - mate @entity27 celebrate at the final whistle as @entity5 moved up to fifth more than his goals , his industry and infectious enthusiasm have lifted the club			1
@entity33 has found a prolific striker who covers more than 13km per game and fans have a hero ; one of their own , as they sing			0
although it might have been different			0
@entity7 were the first club to take @entity1 in when he and @entity40 full back @entity39 were spotted at the age of nine playing for @entity42 , a junior club in @entity43 , @entity44 , famed for producing @entity45			1
former @entity47 coach @entity46 recalls first setting eyes on a young @entity1 , who also followed @entity45 through @entity49			1
after a stunning first half of the season @entity1 is now in line to make the step up to the @entity55 senior side @entity1 impressed on loan at @entity57 during the second half of the 2011 - 12 season - scoring nine goals @entity1 celebrates scoring for @entity60 against @entity61 during his brief spell at the @entity63 two years ago the 21 - year - old has also spent time at the likes of @entity67 and @entity68 over the years ‘ i thought i ’d found myself the next @entity69 , ’ said @entity46 , who now scouts for @entity5			1
‘ in the first training session , there was me and @entity72 , @entity39 ’s dad , putting a side together and i said , “ right , who can play in goal ? ”			2
‘ @entity1 went in and he was unbelievable , not that you ’d have known if you saw him in goal for @entity5			1
then someone told me he was a striker , so he came out and scored about four goals			1
’ in october , having already scored a hat - trick , @entity1 took over in goal when @entity82 was sent off in the @entity83 against @entity84			1
he fumbled a free - kick into the net in the last minute , but @entity5 won 5 - 1 and the episode only enhanced his cult status			1
at @entity7 , he sometimes trained with the goalkeepers , but they chose to let him go and he found his way back to @entity42 , who also produced @entity5 ’s @entity92 , @entity94 ’s @entity93 and @entity96 ’s @entity95			1
‘ he was a bit down after @entity7 let him go , ’ said @entity97 , chairman of @entity47			1
‘ he took a bit of persuading to come back but some of his mates talked him into it and he scored quite a few goals			2
‘ @entity5 picked him up but then let him go and he found himself at @entity104 , where he played in a trial game against @entity5 and scored two			1
that ’s when @entity5 realised they might have made a mistake and asked him to come back			2
‘ the rest is history			0
we do n’t get anything financially			0
that ’s the way it is at the grass roots			0
even 0.1 per cent of @entity93 ’s transfer fee to @entity94 would keep us going for a year			2
but , as a club , we ’re proud			0
@entity1 came back to present some prizes for us a couple of years ago			2
he ’s a good , down - to - earth lad			0
’ this attitude shone through during his loan moves			0
it is four years this month since his senior debut on loan for @entity68 in front of 2,731 on a sodden pitch at @entity124			0
he scored five in his first six games for @entity68 , before a red card slowed his progress			0
there were nine goals for @entity57 , but he broke a metatarsal at @entity67 and @entity5 aborted the one - year loan and sent him instead to @entity60 , where he was used mostly as a substitute			1
at this point , 18 months ago , a top - flight career did not seem to beckon			0
@entity1 salutes the @entity137 crowd after his match winning display for @entity5 against @entity21 @entity5 goalkeeper @entity82 celebrates with @entity1 after the win over @entity21 most would have predicted a move into the lower leagues , but @entity5 , to their credit , have shown patience with talent like @entity92 and @entity147 and both @entity33 and his predecessor @entity148 , who knew @entity1 from the development teams , showed faith			1
@entity1 responded by knuckling down , something those who know him attribute to parents @entity69 and @entity154			2
he does n’t drink , trains hard , is devoted to his career and his desire is shown by his surge past @entity159 and @entity160			0
@entity159 cost £ 26million and had he scored the occasional goal , or had @entity160 not lost his focus , the chance might never have appeared for @entity1			1
but he saw a glimmer and forced his way through , thriving under a manager forced to look beyond reputations			0
@entity1 has tried his hand in goal during the @entity83 when @entity82 was sent off former @entity5 striker @entity170 was @entity1 's hero when he was growing up at first , @entity33 used the 21 - year - old mainly in cup competitions , then a little from the bench			1
a late winner as a substitute at @entity176 was a significant step			0
now , @entity1 simply has to start , either at centre forward or just behind			2
as a boyhood @entity5 fan , he idolised @entity170 and they have similarities			2
like @entity170 , @entity1 has a great appreciation of the game and the movement of others , evident in his assist for @entity25 against @entity21			1
he is strong , good in the air and able to influence the game			0
he has an instinct ; a goal knack			0
he sees the ball early , which offers the illusion of magnetism when it arrives in his orbit , somewhere near the goal			0
top up confidence levels and he will score goals like his second against @entity21 , rolled into the far corner coolly enough for @entity13 to compare him to @entity199			1
it is impossible not to be heartened by the rise of @entity1			2
@entity202 will be watching closely , aware he is eligible for the @entity203 through a grandfather and has been resisting their advances for some time			0
he is determined to play for @entity55			0
and @entity1 is one determined young man			2
do not bet against it			0
