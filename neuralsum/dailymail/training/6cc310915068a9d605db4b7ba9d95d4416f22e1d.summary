everyone knows an estate agent ’s claims should always be treated with caution			1
but one firm really stretched the limits of imagination – by claiming @entity7 was a suburb of @entity9			2
@entity11 ’s advert said its luxury flats in the @entity14 town were ‘ close to one of the world ’s leading financial districts and in one of the most cosmopolitan areas of @entity9 ’			1
in the heart of @entity9 ? an advert for these £ 500,000 flats in @entity7 boasted that they have the ' @entity25 's famous landmarks right on your doorstep ' - despite a season ticket to the capital costing almost £ 4,000 @entity30 : the site of the flats , which will overlook a dual carriageway , court , pub and shopping centre generous : the advert which prompted bemusement from councillors ... and clarified the distance further down it went on : ‘ many of the city ’s famous landmarks , extensive transport routes , social and cultural attractions right on your doorstep			1
it ’s the way you ’ve always imagined city living to be			2
’ that seems unlikely , because @entity7 is 35 miles from @entity9 – or a 23 - minute train journey , for which a season ticket costs all of £ 3,924			1
going by car takes far longer , partly thanks to @entity55 traffic			0
the 130 flats and 359 student rooms overlook a busy dual carriageway , a casino , a pub and the crown court – but a two - bed penthouse costs £ 534,751 , while one - bedroom flats are £ 354,000			1
@entity11 is selling the flats for @entity65			0
last night , it altered the advert text after @entity67 highlighted the disparity			0
luxury : computer - aided images of how the @entity7 flats ' developers believe they will look inside chic : there has been a surge in demand for modern flats as pressure increases on @entity9 housing glossy : despite there being @entity84 interior images , the flats themselves will only be finished next year romantic : the flats will include a view of @entity7 town centre from the floor - to - ceiling windows one @entity7 local , who asked not to be named , said yesterday : ‘ i ’m proud of where i ’m from , but there are n’t many social and cultural attractions near my doorstep			1
' they must be hoping rich foreign students will buy the flats without checking the details			0
’ visitor @entity97 , 28 , said : ‘ i know @entity9 ’s expensive but you could buy a two - bed apartment for half a million quid could n’t you ? why spend it here ? ’ @entity102 , the local councillor responsible for housing , said high prices in @entity9 meant people were moving to @entity7 , pushing the cost of ex-council houses to £ 170,000			1
but he said £ 500,000 even for high - end flats required ‘ a bit of imagination ’			1
‘ for a property on a flyover opposite student accommodation , i do n’t know who would list it for that , ’ he said			0
the flats , complete with gym and 24 - hour concierge , have not yet been built , but are due to be completed in 2016			2
a condition of planning permission was that the project would include affordable housing , and student rooms will be available from £ 56,000			2
development : the three blocks are symbolic of a rush to buy housing in the commuter belt use your imagination : the site of the development , where prices will start at £ 56,000 for a small student room car park : a councillor said paying the £ 535,000 price would ' need a little bit of imagination ' the development is not the only thing in the area to lean rather heavily on its link to the capital – for years , @entity146 has been confusing tourists , who arrive in the @entity148 only to find they still have a long journey ahead			1
@entity7 topped a list of @entity148 ’s worst places to live in the book @entity153 in 2004			0
some 1,800 people voted it the grimmest place in the @entity148			0
despite it having 185,000 residents at the time , just five wrote in to defend it			0
@entity11 said the market for the flats was typically investors in @entity164 and @entity165			0
owner @entity166 said he would modify the description in the ad			0
he said : ‘ we apologise for the error , and trust that this typographical error can be treated as such and was not a deliberate attempt to mislead			1
’ @entity9 @entity173 also known as @entity173 , it was controversially rebranded in 2009 despite being 60 miles from the capital			2
@entity9 @entity176 it was renamed in a bid to turn it into a thriving regional hub , despite being in @entity180 , @entity182 - half an hour 's drive from @entity183			1
@entity183 is then 38 minutes by high - speed train , or well over an hour normally , from @entity9			2
@entity185 aside from being 40 miles from the capital , the airport 's @entity186 was rapped by the advertising watchdog in 2010 when it claimed trains took just 35 minutes to reach @entity9			1
the destination was actually @entity192 , eight miles from the @entity193			0
@entity194 there was a row over the team relocating in 2003 to @entity198 from @entity199 , the origin of the ' @entity201 ' in its name			0
the name remained , but the club relinquished all claim to its history and returned old trophies to @entity9			2
... and ' @entity209 ' airport @entity210 sparked a wee controversy in 2006 when it advertised flights from @entity213 to ' @entity214 ' ... in @entity215 , around 400 miles from the capital .			0

three blocks in @entity14 town include two - bed flats for £ 535,000
@entity222 boasted the ' @entity25 's famous landmarks are right on your doorstep '
but further down it *confessed* the town is actually 30 miles from the city
flats will be next to a casino and court and overlook a dual carriageway
annual season ticket for commuters to @entity9 costs almost £ 4,000
estate agent : it was ' typographical error ' , not attempt to mislead public
