it uses microwave technology to kill mould - forming spores with a third of bread bought by the @entity14 public ending up in the bin , one company has used its loaf ... to develop a technique that keeps the mould away for two months			1
scientists claim to have developed a microwave technique which sterilises food without cooking , helping to extend its shelf - life and minimise the use of preservatives			1
as well as keeping a loaf of bread fresh for 60 days , the method can be used to treat a range of foods including fresh turkey , herbs , fruit and vegetables			0
the average @entity14 family dumps food worth £ 680 every year , creating a vast mountain of rotting waste			1
a fifth of all food coming into the home is thrown away , mainly fruit , vegetables , dairy products and other perishables such as bread and meat			1
the nation dumps 7.2million tons of food worth £ 12billion annually – enough to fill @entity50 nine times			2
the @entity52 says that 32 per cent of bread bought in @entity14 is thrown out			1
in normal conditions , bread can go mouldy in as little as a week			0
but a method developed by @entity4 firm @entity57 could extend its shelf - life by weeks			1
the technology uses pulsed microwaves to pasteurise food at low temperatures ‘ without damaging or changing the quality ’			2
a loaf of bread needs about ten seconds to treat			0
the company says the method was first developed to treat salmonella in eggs , adding : ‘ @entity70 was also used in the research , showing that it too could be treated and the moulding process could be slowed down significantly			2
even after a whole 60 days , the treated bread was compared to that of fresh bread in both quality and freshness			0
’ unlike conventional microwave ovens , there are no hot and cold spots in the machines used in this process , according to the manufacturers			0
chief executive @entity84 admitted it might be difficult to convince consumers of the benefits of long - life bread			0
he said : ‘ we ’ll have to get some consumer acceptance of that			0
most people do it by feel and if you still have that quality feel , they probably will accept it			0
’ going to waste : according to @entity52 figures , nearly one - in - three loaves in the @entity14 is thrown in the bin			1

microwave technology can kill the spores that lead to mould
@entity4 company *believes* technology could end food wastage
almost one - in - three loaves in the @entity14 is thrown in the bin
