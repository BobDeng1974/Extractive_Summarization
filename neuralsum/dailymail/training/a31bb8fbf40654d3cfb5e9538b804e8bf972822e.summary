by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:24 est , 28 february 2014 another day , another survey revealing exactly what makes women tick			1
yes , while we were labouring under the impression that having exceptional academic aptitude , winning the right to vote and running a business were some of the wonders of being a modern woman , apparently we could n’t be more wrong			1
according to a new survey titled @entity17 of @entity18 , @entity19 , hair straighteners and parking sensors are the elements of our modern times that leave women most awed			1
@entity22 's famous six - pack , pictured here , made it onto the long list of @entity25 put the kettle on : tea ( right ) was voted the seventh ' modern wonder ' by a @entity30 survey , @entity17 of @entity18 , whilst hair straighteners ( left ) came third in the @entity30 poll fancy a bite ? chocolate ( left ) was voted fourth by women as their favourite ' @entity37 ' in a @entity30 poll , whilst @entity39 ( right ) were men 's first choice the results , compiled from a survey of 2,000 responses , contain everything from beauty items , food , gadgets and famous faces			1
other ‘ modern day wonders ’ for women include chocolate and @entity51			1
contactless payment , where you can pay for your purchase in a matter of seconds , and a steaming hot cup of tea also made it on to the list			1
cup of tea just outside the top seven were @entity70 , push - up bras , @entity22 's six pack and control pants			1
by contrast , the same poll found that modern man 's @entity17 includes the @entity39 , @entity77 + and @entity79 ’s breasts			2
the @entity85 , @entity81 's curves , 3d movies and a cold pint of lager were also on the list for men			2
on the fringes of the men 's top seven were @entity92 striker @entity91 , the 1998 movie @entity94 and electric shavers			2
cold pint of lager @entity102 of @entity103 @entity30 , which carried out the poll , said : ' parking sensors have made the troublesome parallel park a thing of the past , so we are n't surprised they 've been listed as one of the average woman 's @entity111			0
‘ it ’s clear women ca n’t go without a decent cup of tea and a bar of chocolate - so these things have definitely earned their @entity121 status			2
' @entity122 went on to say that men are ‘ more reliant on technology and gadgets ’ with the @entity39 , @entity77 + , 3d movies and @entity85 all making their list			0
back in the real world , the survey also found that well over half of the respondents said the real , ancient @entity132 could do with modernising - and revealed that there was some confusion over the genuine articles			0
one quarter thought @entity137 was one of the ancient @entity17 and nearly half were under the impression that the @entity141 had been granted the special honour			0
worryingly , clueless @entity143 also thought @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity146 were on the list			0
great pyramid of @entity149 2			0
statue of @entity152 at @entity153 4			0
the @entity163 at @entity164 4			0

survey reveals the elements of today we think are modern wonders
push - up bras , contactless payment cards and @entity22 's six pack *narrowly* *missed* top seven
