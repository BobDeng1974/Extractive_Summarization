dr. @entity0 , a pediatric surgeon - turned - politician , emerged as a major conservative darling on saturday in @entity2 by harping on the @entity5 administration 's immigraton and health care policy – and saying a new approach to energy could put @entity11 presdient @entity10 ' back in his little box			1
' the long - shot potential @entity13 hopeful drew the biggest ovations by far at the morning session of the @entity16 , as @entity18 presidential hopefuls jockeyed for position			1
' we need to use our natural resources ' to generate a new economic recovery , @entity0 said			1
' we 're the number one producer of oil now , on 3 per cent of the land ! the federal governmnt has no business owning all this land			1
this is craziness ! ' the thousand - plus crowd roared			2
' and all the natural gas we have ! now we have the ability to liquefy natural gas , ' @entity0 reminded them , ' which means we can export it			1
' ' this is @entity39 ! ' : @entity0 said saturday that federal public lands should be in private hadns so they can be tapped for oil and gas in a box : @entity11 president @entity10 's economic running room is getting smaller as oil prices drop , and @entity0 says @entity47 should tighten the screws even more @entity49 , a former @entity47 ambassador to the @entity50 , said @entity11 is in an ever - tighter spot as oil prices fall – whether from @entity54 price manipulation or @entity56 drilling and fracking then the soft - spoken man with a dramatic following and a fundraising - savvy ' draft ' movement pushing him to run took aim at @entity11			1
' we need to use those energy resources not only to enhance our economic situation , but also to pay down our debt – and to put @entity10 back in his little box , y'know ? ' plummeting oil prices on the global market , driven by a @entity54 strategy designed to cripple @entity70 , have also created a near - existential crisis in @entity72			1
in june 2014 the price of a barrel of @entity76 crude hovered near $ 115			0
on friday it was $ 49			0
while @entity11 has its conglomerate natural gas production to fall back on , its economy has faltered more as the bottom of the oil market slips lower			1
and @entity47 economic sanctions leveled after military incursions into neighboring @entity85 have added to @entity10 's headaches			2
former @entity47 ambassador to the @entity50 @entity49 , who spoke after lunch , told @entity89 in an interview on the summit 's sidelines that ' the @entity11 live hand to mouth with their oil revenues , as do the @entity70 , and who knows what could happen if prices plummet again and again ? ' ' i think the @entity54 ' main target in allowing the price to fall was @entity70 , but they got a lot of collateral damage out of it as well – in @entity11 , in @entity106 , in @entity107			1
' @entity108 also cited ' our fracking here ' as a factor			2
' while the @entity54 , the @entity114 , the @entity115 and others can sustain for some considerable period of time oil at this level , it has an immediate palpable effect on @entity70 and @entity11 and others			1
' ' and i think the @entity54 understood that			0
' @entity0 believes the @entity47 should grasp the idea too , and use it as a foreign affairs sledgehammer			1
he got bigger applause with a proposal to shrink the federal government ' by attrition			2
' ' thousands of government employees retire every year			0
do n't replace them , ' he said			0
' you do that for about four or five years , and all of a sudden you 've got the government down to a manageable size ... they wo n't have time to stick their big noses in everybody 's business			2
' the government tries to insert itself into everything , ' he emphasized			0
' they want to tell you how to take care of your children , what you should feed them , how you should discipline them			0
' ' you know what ? i would be happy to accept the advice of the government if they were doing everything perfectly			0
' @entity0 spoke at the @entity16 on january 24 in @entity156 , @entity2 as a host of potential 2016 @entity18 presidential candidates jousted on core conservative principles russia next ? sliding oil prices have sent @entity106 on a downward spiral and sent president @entity162 on a trip to @entity164 to make an urgent appeal for cash ; government - controlled supermarkets are limiting what citizens can purchase as the bottom falls out of the nations economy and the rafters shook when he gave a quiet but firm sermon on immigration policy – squarely targeting president @entity5 's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants with residency ids and work permits			1
' we already have laws that demonstrate how a person becomes an @entity56 citizen , ' @entity0 said			1
' we do n't need to relitigate that			0
' ' if we do relitigate that , it has to be by the proper branch of government – @entity188 – not by the president , not by the @entity190			0
' whichever @entity18 wins the @entity13 – his assumption – ' should make it their goal to seal that border within a year , ' he intoned			2
' do we have the ability to seal the border ? sure we do			0
we just do n't have the will to seal the border			0
' he insisted , though , that @entity18 should ' integrate compassion ' into their immigration policy and give illegal immigrants a pathway to work in the @entity47 – under certain strict circumstances			1
' i do n't think they should have to hide in the shadows , ' he said , pointing to @entity209 's guest worker program as a model			0
' we should n't offer jobs unless @entity47 wo n't take them			2
and in order to get a guest worker permit , you have to apply for it from outside of @entity47			2
' ' you should n't get an advantage for breaking the law , ' he said			0
@entity221 : @entity54 dropped oil prices by more than half in order to cripple regional rival @entity70 – but @entity11 , @entity106 and @entity107 have become collateral damage @entity0 leaped into the national consciousness in 2013 by saying during a @entity229 speech that the @entity230 – @entity230 – was the worst thing to happen to the @entity47 ' since slavery			1
' @entity0 , an @entity56 , said so with a more famous black man , president @entity5 , sitting two seats away			1
' we do not need the government controlling our healthcare , ' he reiterated on saturday			0
' even if it worked , i would oppose it			0
[ but ] it does n't			0
' ' i do n't believe in taking the most important thing a person has , which is their health , their healthcare , and putting it in the hands of the government , ' @entity0 said , ' because if they control your healthcare , it 's not long before they control your whole life			1
' ' and that changes the entire relationship			0

@entity47 should drill for more oil and gas , and sell public lands to do it , said the @entity56 presidential long - shot with a cult - like following
' the federal governmnt has no business owning all this land , ' @entity0 said ' ' this is craziness ! '
the lower oil prices go , the more @entity11 , @entity70 and @entity106 falter
former @entity50 @entity273 said ' the @entity11 live hand to mouth with their oil revenues '
@entity0 and @entity108 are part of a saturday @entity18 *cattle* - call in @entity2 , organized by *hometown* conservative @entity280 rep. @entity280
