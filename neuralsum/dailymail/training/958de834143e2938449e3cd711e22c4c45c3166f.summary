danger : even with @entity14 's centr likely staying well away from the @entity2 coast , large swells will impact the @entity17 the next few days taking a turn : @entity14 weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds , making it a category 1 storm @entity14 generated large swells that kicked up the surf and caused dangerous rip currents along the beaches of the @entity173 , @entity16 and parts of the @entity175 , the forecasters said			2
