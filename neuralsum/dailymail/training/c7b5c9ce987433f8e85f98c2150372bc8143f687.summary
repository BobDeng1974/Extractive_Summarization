by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:49 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 09:48 est , 31 december 2012 if politics is showbusiness for ugly people , these are the a-listers who became screen stars in the last 12 months - and not always for the right reasons			1
this year might have seen the @entity9 report published , police and crime commissioners elected and the eurozone crisis grinding on			1
but for most people the year in politics will be best remembered for the omnishambles budget , a certain top @entity16 caught on a zip - wire and @entity19 ' campaign bus rolling into the i 'm a celebrity jungle			1
here we count down the 10 most memorable political videos of 2012 , proving that the people running the country are as hapless as the rest of us			1
@entity28 and @entity29 throw some shapes with the world looking on , @entity32 organisers decided to wind up the @entity32 with a reunion of the @entity35 singing atop a fleet of black cabs			2
but that was not the most excruciating moment			2
oh no. the honour goes to the prime minister and mayor of london for taking joint gold for @entity44			1
@entity45 's ' long and frustrating day ' we may never find out what @entity45 really said to police on that fateful september night when he was told he could not ride his bike through the gates of @entity51			1
forced to quit as chief whip over claims he called police ' f * * * * * * plebs ' he has seized on @entity58 footage which appears to contradict the official police log of the incident			2
but far more entertaining was his public apology for the cameras in september , including his claim that he had had a ' long and frustrating day ' which it later emerged involved lunch at one of @entity69 's most expensive curry houses			1
@entity28 's pasty omnishambles you know things are bad for the government when spin doctors decide footage of the pm playing badminton is the best distraction			1
sadly @entity28 's prowess with a shuttlecock failed to deflect attention from the @entity81 , which proposed hiking vat on hot pasties			1
with @entity85 posing awkwardly in bakeries to capitalise on the growing public backlash , the @entity84 was challenged to say when he last ate one of @entity89 's finest			1
his answer in march soon unraveled , when it turned out the shop in @entity92 had shut down two years earlier			0
@entity93 asks : ' is that a lady or a man ? ' allies of the @entity98 say he is the right man for the job because he can identify with the average voter			0
but in march @entity93 was unable to identify even the gender of a member of the audience at a q&a session			0
even the beard was not a big enough clue			0
' is this some sort of joke ? ' @entity107 mauls @entity110 newsnight interviews are tricksy affairs for ministers at the best of times			0
but when junior treasury minister @entity110 was sent on in june to explain yet another u-turn she knew nothing about , @entity115 took no prisoners			0
she coughed and spluttered her way through the grilling over the surprise announcement that a 3p rise in fuel duty would not now go ahead , but @entity69 insiders agreed she had been like a lamb to the slaughter while the chancellor dined in @entity51			0
she was shunted to the @entity128 in september 's reshuffle			1
@entity19 finds reality tv hard to swallow conservative mp @entity19 claimed her decision in october to swap @entity69 for the i 'm a celebrity jungle would give her chance to discuss hot topics like lowering the abortion limit in front of an audience of millions			0
instead the @entity141 mp was seen eating camel toe in a @entity143 against @entity144 from @entity145			0
the first celeb to be kicked out in a public vote , ms @entity19 was then suspended from the @entity16 party and has still not been let back in			0
60,000 @entity151 fans tell @entity152 what they think of him the chancellor always predicted he would become unpopular as the cuts started to bite			0
but he probably did not expect the public to voice their disapproval as he gave out medals at the @entity151 in august			0
surprisingly , mr @entity152 appears to laugh , almost as if he is enjoying it			0
@entity29 's high wire act goes wrong the mayor of @entity163 became the undisputed non-sporting star of @entity32 - from trying his hand at sitting volleyball to taking a ride in a cable car with @entity169			2
but it was the moment a pre-olympics stunt on a zipwire went wrong for which he will be best remembered , making him an internet hit around the world			2
amazingly , the flag - waving , whiff - whaff - playing @entity177 was later named @entity180 's most respected politician			1
@entity182 's apology hits the charts there was a time when @entity182 was more popular in the polls than @entity187			2
then effigies of the @entity190 leader were burnt in the street and dog 's mess was pushed through his letter box			2
so what does a politician in trouble in the polls do ? record a video message apologising for promising not to increase tuition fees , which is then remixed by satirical website @entity201 , before agreeing to its release to raise funds for a children 's hospital			1
it reached 143 in the charts in september			0
@entity209 's @entity44 clanger whose idea was it to start the greatest show on earth with nationwide bell - ringing anyway ? culture secretary @entity209 kicked off the @entity32 in july with a magnificent display of campanology , only slightly hampered by the sight of his ringer flying off and hitting a woman in the crowd on board @entity221			1
it is even better in slow motion .			0

forget the @entity226 and the eurozone crisis , the last 12 months in politics are best remembered for the *howlers*
from @entity44 *standard* dad *dancing* to *bushtucker* trials , we chart the *funniest* political clips of 2012
but which politician 's hilarious clanger will be @entity238 ?
