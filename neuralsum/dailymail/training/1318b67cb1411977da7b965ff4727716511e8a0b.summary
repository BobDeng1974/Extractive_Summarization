by @entity0 a daredevil skydiver has broken a world record after jumping out of a plane with the world 's smallest parachute - with a canopy less than half the size of a normal device			1
@entity9 made diving history by landing the 35 square foot parachute at the @entity12 , in @entity13 , on saturday			1
while expert sky divers use parachutes that range in size from 80 to 200 square feet , even the smallest of the high - performance canopy sizes developed over the last ten years average between 70 and 90 square feet			1
mr @entity9 , a test pilot for @entity26 and @entity27 canopies and professional stuntman with more than 7,000 skydives under his belt , therefore required months of training to ensure he would be able to deal with any situation during the jump			2
mr @entity9 said : ' @entity43 is the product of a man 's dream to fly and land the world 's smallest parachute			2
' regardless of the size of the challenge , a dream will always be a dream if there is no determination to make it reality			0
' the jump was performed under highly experimental conditions and using specially designed prototype equipment			0
the previous unofficial record for the smallest parachute landed was held by @entity60 who jumped a 37 square foot canopy in 2008			2
back to earth : mr @entity9 manages to land the smallest parachute in the world at the @entity12 , in @entity13 in the air : the extreme reduction in size meant the parachute was at risk of going into a dangerous spin , which can cause an almost instant loss of consciousness flying high : the jump was performed under highly experimental conditions and using specially designed prototype equipment record breaker : the previous unofficial record for the smallest parachute landed was held by @entity60 who jumped a 37 square foot canopy in 2008 after completing the jump , mr @entity9 said : ' many people may look at what i have achieved as a highly risky stunt			1
' there has been a full team of highly experienced professionals involved in the execution of this unique and highly dangerous world record and months of preparation went into this			0
' i 'd like my next adventure to be on the ground now , as i really want to be a father so i will get busy in other ways to make this happen			0
' i 'm sure my wife does n't want me to do another stunt like this anytime soon			0

@entity9 made diving history by landing 35 sq ft parachute in @entity13
@entity104 was less than half the size of smallest high - performance parachute
reduction in size meant parachute was at risk of going into a spin
the spin could have *resulted* in almost instant loss of consciousness
