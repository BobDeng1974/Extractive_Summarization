by @entity0 @entity1 's has long been considered the ultimate @entity3 drink - but punters may be getting less than they bargained for			1
a glass of the drink costs nearly £ 8 at the championships , but scientific analysis has revealed that it can be so diluted that it is just 2.5 per cent alcohol			0
this implies that the @entity1 's served at @entity3 is less than half as strong as is officially recommended - although organisers insist that they are following the manufacturer 's guidelines			1
the original drink is always 25 per cent @entity24 , but the alcohol level of the final product can vary hugely depending on how much lemonade and ice are included			0
@entity3 claims to sell around 230,000 glasses of @entity1 's every year - more than 20,000 a day - at a price of £ 7.80 per drink from the official bars			1
