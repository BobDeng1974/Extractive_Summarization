photographer @entity6 , 37 , captured these stunning images of the moon jellyfish as he snorkelled during an excursion off the coast of @entity10			1
@entity6 watched and swam with the jellyfish for two hours and because they do n't sting he could let them swim right up to him and even brush against his arm			1
photographer @entity6 captures a stunning image taken while snorkelling underneath a moon jellyfish while in the @entity5			1
the fascinating creatures look like @entity19			0
this image shows a fish swimming beneath it			0
moon jellyfish do n't sting meaning photographer @entity6 could swim right up to the creatures in order to capture shots such as this one , while snorkelling in the @entity5 the official name of the moon jellyfish is aurelia aurita			1
it is also known as the moon jelly , common jellyfish , or saucer jelly			1
all the species in the aurealia genus look and swim so similarly that it 's difficult to identify related , and it is difficult to identify which is which with taking gene samples			0
the moon jellyfish grows to about 40cm in diameter			1
it eats plankton and molluscs with its tentacles and brings them into their bodies to be digested			0
it can only make small , limited movements so usually drifts with the current , even when swimming			2
it ca n't sting and is often attacked by sea birds , sea turtles and the @entity55			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity56 , @entity4 , said : ' i was snorkelling on my own near the border to @entity59 when countless jellyfish drifted in			2
i knew this species did n't sting so i was not scared but mesmerised by their slow and graceful pulsating movement			1
' to the naked eye underwater , the jellyfish appear a little more pink and the very soft and diffused transparent colour really makes them look like fairies			2
' the jellyfish , which measured 20 - 25 centimetres in diameter , can swim by pulsating their tentacles but were also carried along by the current			1
mr @entity6 added : ' the jellyfish look like they are individual cells with their own subconscious intelligence to guide through drifting life style			2
' i also learned they provide shelter for juvenile fish that also got drifted by the current , which i thought was sweet			2
' i was very close and swam among many of the jellyfish and they would contact my arms or legs even without trying			2
' as long as i found individuals with beautiful shapes i continued to shoot , because i did not have a time limit i would have had if i had been scuba diving			0
' i surfaced when my body could not stop shivering underwater from staying in cold water without proper wetsuit			0
' the many jellyfish drifted off but also many new jellyfish kept coming			0
' mr @entity6 also saw many colourful fish , blue spotted stingrays , @entity97 , octopuses , squid , lionfish , barracudas and turtles			0
the moon jellyfish is translucent and grows to about 40 cm in diameter			1
it can be identified by its four horseshoe - shaped gonads ( pictured ) , seen through the top of the bell			0
this image was captured by photographer @entity6 in the @entity5 the moon jellyfish does n't sting			1
this means it is often attacked by sea birds and sea turtles			0
it is part of the aurelia genus of jellyfish that lives along the eastern @entity119 coast of @entity120 and the western @entity119 coast of @entity122 in @entity123 and @entity124			0
it is usually found in estuaries and harbours			0

rare photos show the moon jellyfish floating and being carried by the current in the @entity5
moon jellyfish do n't sting meaning the photographer could get as close to the jellyfish to touch it
