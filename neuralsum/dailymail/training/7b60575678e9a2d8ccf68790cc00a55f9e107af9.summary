scientists at @entity2 have confirmed a 19th century book in one of the university 's libraries is bound in human skin @entity16 is believed to have presented the book , a meditation on the soul and life after death , to his friend dr @entity33 scientists confirmed the binding on the book , housed in the @entity36 , is human skin after using a technique known as peptide mass fingerprintings to analyse microscopic samples			1
the results create a ' peptide mass fingerprint ' ( @entity43 ) which allows scientists to then rule out ' fingerprints ' from other sources			0
@entity47 , director of the @entity48 and @entity49 , said : ' the @entity43 from @entity15 matched the human reference , and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources , such as sheep , cattle and goat			0
' however , although the @entity43 was consistent with human , other closely related primates , such as the great apes and gibbons , could not be eliminated because of the lack of necessary references			0
' further tests were carried out on the samples however which led the scientists to conclude it was ' very unlikely that the source could be other than human			0
' in a blogpost on the library 's website , @entity70 , assistant curator of @entity72 , claims @entity33 bound the book with skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient who died of a stroke			1
a note inside the book , written by @entity33 , reads : ' a book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering : i had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman ' in the note , @entity33 also refers to another book bound in human skin , @entity89 's @entity88 integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis , which is in the @entity94 collection @entity16 is believed to have presented the book to his friend dr @entity33			2
