the only surviving example of the world 's first aircraft carrier which measures just 58ft long has been restored			1
a far cry from the @entity6 's new 920ft aircraft carrier @entity7 , the tiny boat could carry just one plane which was launched by towing it behind another boat into the wind			1
the simple vessels were used to launch @entity14 biplanes from the middle of the sea so they could attack @entity18 airships before they reached @entity19			1
@entity21 curator @entity20 with the world 's first aircraft carrier , which was found rusting on the banks of the @entity24 the craft , loaded with a biplane , being towed behind another boat ahead of a launch a @entity30 plane would be strapped to the deck of the boat and taken out to sea before being towed into the wind at over 20 knots			1
crew had to hold the plane back while the pilot got the engine up to speed then release the chocks at the right moment			2
the pilot had just 58 feet of ' runway ' to get the plane airborne or it would plummet into the sea with disastrous consequences			1
and even if the plane made it into the air , the only way the pilot could land again was by crashing into the sea in the hope of being rescued			0
the craft were the brainchild of the @entity57 , who built them in a bid to end the destruction caused by bombs dropped on @entity19 by @entity18 zeppelins			1
the plane would be launched by the towing vessel steering into the wind and speeding up until there was enough lift to get the plane airbourne the pilot had just 58 feet of ' runway ' to get the plane off the deck or it would plummet into the sea by launching planes out to sea the zeppelins could be intercepted and shot down before they could unleash their deadly payloads			1
the only existing example of the craft , called a seaplane lighter , was discovered rusting on the banks of the @entity24 by a passing naval historian in 1996			1
it was salvaged by experts at the @entity87 who have spent 12 years restoring it to its former glory			2
they now plan to give it pride of place in a new entrance hall at the museum in @entity97 , @entity98 , with a restored @entity30 mounted on it			2
@entity20 , curator of aircraft at the @entity87 , said : ' the boat came to us after it was spotted on the banks of the @entity24			1
length - 57.97 feet width - 16 feet depth - 6.89 feet weight - approximately 30 tons @entity105 - none , towed on a line by another boat number of @entity108 @entity109 - around 20 knots when towed @entity111 - 1918 @entity113 biplane number of @entity114 , open air @entity116 to build - unknown length - 918 feet width - 239 feet depth - 128 feet ( waterline ) 230 feet ( total ) @entity118 - approximately 70,000 tons @entity105 48,000hp engines , four 12,000hp engines and two @entity122 motors number of @entity123 @entity124 of 25 knots @entity126 trials to begin in 2017 @entity128 fighter jets @entity129 - 10 including flight - deck cost to build - Â£ 3.1billion ' it was actually in remarkable condition			1
we have stripped back the @entity135 paint that covered it and returned it to its original @entity14 condition			2
' it 's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today , but believe it or not this is where it all started			2
' the deadly effect of the basic craft was displayed on august 10 , 1918 when lieutenant @entity148 took off from one for the first time			0
after completing the daring launch , lt @entity148 climbed to 19,000ft before opening fire on zeppelin @entity152 , sending the giant airship down in a ball of flame into the @entity157			2
the mission was so successful the @entity18 , petrified of the @entity160 ' new aerial capabilities , stopped all zeppelin attacks on @entity19			1
lt @entity148 was awarded the @entity162 in recognition of his bravery during the attack			0
the vessel 's take - off ramp being constructed during the @entity14 mr @entity20 said : ' it 's incredible to compare it to aircraft carriers of today , but believe it or not this is where it all started ' the seaplane lighters would be dwarfed by the @entity6 's new @entity176 queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers , which are 920ft long and can carry 40 fighter jets			1
@entity20 , said : ' it is one of the great @entity14 pieces still in existence and among just a few original large objects remaining			0
' during the war the @entity57 decided they needed to to be able to launch planes from the sea , and came up with the idea of a small craft that could be towed behind a destroyer or frigate			0
the aircraft carrier would launch @entity30 biplanes , like that pictured above ( top ) with a @entity18 @entity195 ( below ) ' planes had been put on the back of ships before but this was the first ever boat purpose built for launching aircraft from			1
fifty were ordered and 35 ended up being built			0
' the concept was that the seaplane lighter would be towed out into the middle of the sea with a plane loaded on it			0
' it would then be towed at speeds of up to 20 knots into a headwind of the same strength thereby creating enough lift for the plane to take off			0
' initially the planes used were flying boats that could land on water but then on july 21 1918 lieutenant @entity148 proved it possible to take off using a @entity30 biplane			0
' it was an incredibly dangerous task because the plane had to be airborne by the time it got to the end of the 58ft deck			0
' if it was n't it would fall off the front and then be hit by the lighter , resulting in instant death for the pilot			0
' even if the plane got airborne the pilot had to carry out a daring mission at 17,000ft , all the time exposed to the elements			0
' the big snag was that unless the mission was taking place in sight of land , the only option was for the pilot to crash land the plane in the sea close to the flagship and hope he was rescued			0
' three weeks after lt @entity148 's test flight he took off on a mission in the @entity157 and shot down @entity247			0
' it was hugely risky but it gave the @entity19 troops a massive advantage over the @entity18 and all but ended the threat from zepellins overnight			2

first of its kind @entity14 aircraft carrier was towed by another boat
unlike its huge *modern* *descendants* , the ship had just 58 feet of runway
it was built to launch biplanes to stop @entity18 airship raids on @entity19
the plane was towed into the wind before crew pulled away plane 's chocks
the 70 - year - old vessel was found on the banks of the @entity24 by a historian
it is now going on display at the @entity87 in @entity98
