one in four criminals went straight back to crime , according to new figures which the government admitted are ‘ shameful ’			1
and almost 1,000 offenders have been recalled to prison but are still on the loose			2
the figures are particularly embarrassing for ministers coming just days after @entity9 ’s crime and justice speech in which he promised a ‘ rehabilitation revolution ’			1
prime minister @entity9 ( right ) was escorted around c wing by prison officer @entity13 , during a visit to @entity15 this wek almost 50,000 offences were committed by offenders who had spent time in jail last year			0
@entity20 claimed the government ’s justice policy is ‘ in tatters ’			1
in 2010 , a total of 497,969 offences were committed by 173,274 offenders			0
more than half ( 55.3 per cent ) of the offences were committed by 78,149 offenders with 11 or more previous offences			0
more than 50,123 of these involved 10,000 offenders who had previously been jailed more than 10 times			0
for criminals leaving jail , the reoffending rate was 47.5 per cent , up from 46.8 per cent in 2009			1
among adults jailed for less than 12 months , 57.6 % went on to commit another crime			2
meanwhile , separate figures showed more than 150 violent criminals and sex offenders are at large in the community despite breaching the terms of their release or committing another offence			0
a total of 988 criminals had been recalled to prison but not put back behind bars by the end of june			0
these include 17 killers - 16 of them murderers - 11 rapists and at least four paedophiles			0
some 379 have been on the run for more than five years , the figures showed			0
almost 1,000 criminals have been recalled to jail , but are still not behind bars a @entity60 spokesman said : ‘ we are tackling the shamefully high reoffending rates in this country by introducing a rehabilitation revolution - offenders must be punished , but we must also deal with the root causes of offenders ' behaviour so they do n't return to crime			1
’ the prime minister used a major speech to declare he wanted to break the cycle of reoffending by the end of 2015			1
all but a small number of high - risk prisoners would receive help to turn their lives around			2
but @entity20 ’s shadow justice secretary @entity79 said : ‘ this government ’s justice policy is in tatters			1
@entity9 's latest re-launch 29 months after first becoming prime minister wo n’t change these appalling figures			2
‘ he should be aggressively addressing the scandalous rates of reoffending rather than stunts			1
cutting police and probation , reducing judges ’ powers and reducing help to victims shows how out of touch he is			0

@entity60 says it is *determined* to tackle ' shamefully high reoffending rates '
days after the @entity83 's big crime speech , @entity20 claims the government 's justice policy is ' in tatters '
