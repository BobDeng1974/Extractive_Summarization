@entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 all own a pair of @entity6 's @entity5 shorts increase core body temperature so wearer expend more energy by @entity11 published : 05:44 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 02:30 est , 18 may 2012 they sound too good to be true			1
a pair of pants that allow you to burn calories simply by wearing them			0
but that is just what @entity6 's @entity19 claim to do			1
launched last year amid great fanfare , the Â£ 50 garment can help the wearer burn four times the number of calories they would expend during a regular work out , the firm says			2
and what 's more , when the wearer stops their physical activity , the shorts continue to burn calories at a rate of 16 per cent more than the body would burn without the shorts			1
we might not be - but there 's a good chance @entity40 is - she was given a pair late last year			2
or @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and any one of @entity3 , all of whom have their own pairs of the fat - burning magic pants			1
@entity2 was so impressed by the shorts that she was moved to wax lyrical about them in her newspaper column the company , who have released two collections of their @entity19 to date , which include both bottom and calf - targeting garments , has just released their summer collection - a brightly coloured , lighter range that uses less fabric to get the same results			1
that means a lighter feel on the body , but the same number of calories burned , according to @entity6			2
just as with the original @entity19 and the rest of the @entity6 range , the new @entity19 target the thighs , stomach and bottom , and claim they can help wearers lose two jean sizes in two weeks			2
working up a sweat : @entity6 's @entity19 raise the core body temperature to increase the number of calories expended with physical exercise fat - burners : the colourful new summer range is made of a lighter fabric than previous collections but are just as effective , the firm says the shorts work by increasing perspiration - and the manufacturers say the results have been ' lab - proven ' by scientists , after researchers from the @entity98 at @entity99 found weight loss to be four times greater in subjects who exercised wearing the @entity19			1
the core temperature in @entity19 increased by an average of 18 per cent compared to the control , they found - with the effects ongoing after activity has ceased			0
the firm 's @entity110 page is full of thousands of enthusiastic women extolling the virtues of the @entity19			0
@entity114 writes on the firm 's wall that she has lost eight pounds thanks to the shorts			0
' for the past seven weeks i 've been wearing my @entity120 under my shorts when i run during my lunch hour monday to friday , and under my pants when i zumba three times a week			0
and i am happy to report i 've lost 8 pounds and am finally back to my normal weight whereas i had been struggling for 7 months prior			0
' another wrote : ' three weeks wearing my @entity19 and i 've lost three inches from my waist and one and a half from my thighs			0
' the shorts are available from @entity132			0
