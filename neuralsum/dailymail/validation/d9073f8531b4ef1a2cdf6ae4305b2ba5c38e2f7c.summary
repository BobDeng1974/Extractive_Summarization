he had gone on daytime television to try to win over the women voters he struggles to appeal to			1
@entity4 had even been given a list of ‘ women - friendly ’ policies to show how he could cater to the audience of @entity9			1
then he went and said it was a ‘ fact of life ’ that women will earn less than men when they return to some jobs after childbirth			2
he told the @entity27 daytime panel show : ‘ if you ’re a doctor , a lawyer , a researcher , you ’re a woman , you have a baby , you take six months or a year off			2
you are not disadvantaged at all in that job			2
‘ but there are other jobs in which if you take six months off and come back you find yourself behind the rest of the pack and earning less money			2
that is a fact of life			0
it ’s difficult to change that			0
’ @entity56 ’s business spokesman @entity55 was one of those who objected to the comment			0
she wrote on @entity59 : ‘ sorry , @ @entity60 said what ? ! just a fact of life is it women earn less after kids ? no it ’s an injustice and we can change it			0
’ @entity67 : ' i do n't really know much about politics but can you tell me why you 've been voted the most hated man in @entity23 ? ' mr @entity4 : ' that 's quite a compliment is n't it ' @entity74 asked him why he had dropped his immigration cap			1
she said he was a ' bit flip - floppy '			1
mr @entity4 : ' the cap is a nonsense			1

you went to public school , ’ but mr @entity4 went on : ‘ you look at these political figures , they are all like cardboard cut - outs			1
they are all playing safe , they are all scared of the media			0
i ’m not , i ’m a bit like @entity124			0
people either like me or do n’t like me			0
’ he said all politicians are fundamentally ‘ selfish ’ and neglect their families			0
he said : ‘ the other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are , how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds			0
all i can say is , it ’s pretty much impossible to do that			0
