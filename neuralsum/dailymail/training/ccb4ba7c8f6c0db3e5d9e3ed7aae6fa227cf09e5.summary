a pair of science enthusiasts are thrilled after successfully launching a homemade probe into outer space - complete with @entity5 versions of themselves on board			1
the tiny toy characters , resembling best friends @entity9 and @entity10 , even got to walk in space as astronaut @entity12 floated around the @entity14 ’s atmosphere when his strapping became loose			1
after setting off from @entity17 , @entity18 last wednesday , the £ 250 device named the @entity19 , journeyed to 90,000ft before plunging back down to the ground in a farmer ’s field in @entity23 , @entity24 - and the whole journey was caught on camera			1
' so , we thought we would use @entity5 men that are little versions of us - @entity12 ’s even has glasses , and they ’re dressed like astronauts			2
' at one point it all went a bit crazy and @entity12 ’s strapping came loose , meaning his @entity5 man did a little space - walk in front of the camera ! ' made from only a high - altitude balloon , a payload and an hd camera , the @entity19 enjoyed the high life for around two - and - a - half - hours			1
primary teacher @entity12 , and @entity10 tracked its descent from the ground and collected it some 75 miles away from its launchpad			0
the intrepid pair , who met while studying aerospace engineering at @entity59 , built the probe in their spare time after retaining a keen interest in space			2
the tiny toy characters , attached to the probe ahead of launch , were made to resemble best friends @entity9 and @entity10 the two @entity5 characters were launched from @entity17 , @entity18 last wednesday , on a £ 250 device named the @entity19 @entity10 , an entrepreneur and online technology reviewer , said : ' we wanted to come up with something which was an interesting project that might inspire others			1
' it ’s basically a balloon with a hd camera attached to it , which we launched to almost 100,000ft			1
' we were able to video its journey from take - off to landing , so with the @entity5 characters on board , it was almost like we were travelling in space			2
' when we saw we had reached outer space , we were just amazed			2
wow ! ' video : the @entity87 's flight through space made from only a high - altitude balloon , a payload and a hd camera , the @entity19 enjoyed the high life for around two - and - a - half - hours the tiny toy characters even got to walk in space as astronaut @entity12 floated around the earth 's atmosphere when his strapping became loose the duo , from @entity100 , had to intricately plan where to launch the probe from , taking into consideration weather condition and proximity to any nearby airports			1
' we had to wait for a good day , and for a time when we could devote ourselves to doing it , ' said @entity10			0
' we got clearance from the @entity110 , who gave us some conditions like not to let it drift , and not to get too close to any airports , for obvious reasons			0
' it was very nerve - wrecking and there was a moment where i thought we had lost it , but it went better than expected			0
' the probe managed to reach a height of 90,000ft - more than three times the height of @entity122			1
while at this height the probe captured stunning images such as this one the probe was able to capture some stunning images , such as this one of our planet , while on its journey and the two @entity5 men enjoyed a safe landing , despite rising to heights more than three times the height of @entity122			1
@entity12 , 31 , said : ' it was really exhiliarating to know that this thing has been to the edge of space and come back down , and that the technology had worked as it was supposed to			0
' it was real excitement and relief at the same time			0
when we launched it , we were a bit despondent for some time thinking it would n’t come back - some people release them and never hear from them again			2
' @entity12 now plans to write a guide on making and launching a space camera , which could be used in schools			0
he added : ' i ’m really , really keen on extra-curricular activities in schools and i think this could really inspire kids to stuffy physics and other sciences			0
' the pair will now spend the winter planning their next project			0

amateur space *explorers* launched @entity5 figures from @entity17 , @entity18
used a £ 250 probe made from a high - altitude balloon and a hd camera
@entity175 reached 90,000ft - more than three times the height of @entity122
one of the @entity5 figures was pictured floating around the @entity14 ’s atmosphere
