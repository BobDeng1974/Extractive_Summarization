she first traveled to the eastern @entity12 nation in 1993 while it was going through its shocking orphan crisis			2
fresh from having been rejected by @entity15 as an 18 - year - old , she hoped the experience suggested by her father would boost a future @entity20 application			1
she ended up staying in @entity4 for 10 - months , and it worked with a new application to study modern history at @entity15 accepted			1
but the huge impression the eastern @entity12 nation left on the teenager saw her return to @entity4 a year later to teach @entity27			1
life long association : @entity2 the writer and tv presenter at her home in south @entity33 it was during that second trip that she first met the brother of one of her students , who she has since married , but will only refer to as ' @entity39 ' , as he hates the limelight			1
@entity41 is ' obsessive ' about @entity4 and said ' i just think it 's a f * * * * * * great country			2
i got so much from that year			2
' it gave me my balls ; it gave me a lot of my identity ; it gave me a whole fresh look at life			2
' she found @entity15 life ' pompous ' while studying after the gritty basics she experienced while at the orphanage			1
at the time @entity4 she had found shockingly poor conditions , and children so damaged they compulsively self - harmed			2
the older children would fight with her and steal from her , but the contrast to her own sheltered upbringing left her felt needed and loved in a way she had never experienced before			0
on her second trip to @entity4 when she met her future husband their romance was beyond the ordinary because @entity41 was 19 and @entity39 was 12			1
close : @entity2 with her father @entity65 who died in 2009 and donated his body to medical science she was often invited to the family home for super and came to single out @entity39 as a bright , canny child with an ear for language			0
he started going to her @entity27 classes , becoming a top pupil , although she said at the time here interest was not romantic			1
she said : ' of course it never occurred to me that , you know ... [ but ] i noticed a stillness in him , a peacefulness , i think is the word , that made him stand out			0
' keen to help her friend she organised a scholarship for @entity39 to study at her former boarding school , @entity87 in @entity88			0
@entity41 did n't visit him while he was at the school , enjoying her own student life at @entity15 , getting into rowing and boyfriends			1
sporty : @entity2 at @entity95 in south @entity33 in 2009 @entity39 did well in class , and the school offered to sponsor him , but overwhelmed with homesickness , he decided to return to his family			1
after graduating @entity41 moved to @entity33 , landing a job on talk radio station @entity101 in the 1990s , starting on the night - time shift			1
she progressed well and was handed her own daytime show to present , but @entity4 remained in her thoughts			0
she went to visit the country again , visiting @entity39 's family again , and fell in love - he was 19 , and she was 27 - years - old			1
she said : ' i just knew , it was like bang			0
we did n't kiss or anything but i just felt it			0
' the age difference never felt wrong she said , and the pair kept in touch via email and then phone , spending up to £ 400 a month on calls			2
the romance is detailed in her new book , to @entity4 with @entity124 , her autobiography about their romance			2
happily married : @entity2 she declines to reveal her husbands real name in the book because he hates the fact she has even written it			0
despite his concern it describes how when they were first together , @entity39 seemed more interested in being a teenager , than with a @entity33 based radio presenter			1
it was at that time that @entity41 's father , who she was very close to , was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer			0
she distracted herself from the devastating blow by pouring even more energy into her obsession with @entity39 - relentlessly worrying about his smoking			2
eventually her mother stepped in writing to him , asking him to give up tobacco because her daughter was so upset , and demonstrating some commitment , he did			0
while @entity2 's father was mostly against the match , her mother favoured the young @entity4 , and helped research how he could move to @entity33			1
they eventually married in @entity4 , and @entity41 's father who died in 2009 , had finally accepted the union although it was n't his ideal in his opinion			0
more guilt about their pairing came from his family , with @entity39 's mother sobbing at the wedding that her son was being stolen away with his move to @entity165			0
despite the unusual start , family difficulties , cultural divide and long distance , the couple now have a three - year - old daughter @entity171 , who is fluent in @entity27 and @entity4			1
@entity2 said : ' so , i fell in love with a younger man			0
