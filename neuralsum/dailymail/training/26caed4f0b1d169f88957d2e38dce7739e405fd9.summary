by @entity0 ordering a hamburger when you ’re trying to impress a date can lead to disaster			0
one bite and lashings of gherkins , sauce and salad will find themselves all over your face , hands and clothes			0
but now scientists have come up with the perfect way to hold a burger that could avoid this awkward scenario			2
instead of the traditional method of holding a burger using thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top , scientists claim you should use both thumbs and pinkies to hold the bottom of the burger ( right ) and the three middle fingers to hold it from the top ( left ) after four intensive months of research , scientists believe they have finally found the solution to holding a hamburger without causing a spillage			1
the secret is all in using the pinkie			0
instead of the traditional method of holding a burger using thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top , scientists claim you should use both thumbs and pinkies to hold the bottom of the burger			1
the remaining three middle fingers should be used to hold the top of the bun in place			2
this divides the burger into equal parts meaning that it can be held uniformly			0
three researchers – experts in mechanics , engineering , and dentistry – spent four months coming up with the perfect solution			1
the study was organised by @entity57 television show ' @entity58 ! ? ' and involved a 3d scan of a burger to try and understand how the different elements worked together			2
most people hold a burger using their thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top			1
but the @entity57 data revealed that this technique is completely wrong			0
instead they found that using thumbs and the little fingers to hold the bottom , while using the middle three fingers on each hand to hold the top , would avoid spillages			1
this divides the burger into equal parts meaning that it can be held uniformly , according to a report in @entity80			0
the scientist warned against holding on too tightly in case the bun is crushed and the contents spills out the back			0
also , the dental expert suggested warming up the muscles in your mouth before eating a big hamburger by opening and closing it a few times			1
something to try , perhaps , next time you ’re attempting to impress your lunch companion			0
most people hold a burger using thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top which scientists say can lead to disastrous results			1

@entity57 scientists spent four months coming up with the perfect solution
they found people should use thumbs and pinkies to hold the bottom of bun
dental expert also suggested warming up the muscles in the mouth prior to eating by opening and closing it a few times
