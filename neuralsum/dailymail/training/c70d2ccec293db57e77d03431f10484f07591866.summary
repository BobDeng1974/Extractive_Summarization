by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 07:27 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 yesterday accused the @entity3 of wanting to ‘ pull up the drawbridge ’ to @entity6 workers as plans for a new migrant cap began to disintegrate			2
documents leaked at the weekend suggested the @entity10 wanted to limit the number of workers arriving from the rest of the @entity6 at 75,000 a year			1
the idea drew a ferocious response from the @entity16 leader who claimed it was ‘ illegal ’ , ‘ unworkable ’ and would be a ‘ disaster ’ for @entity20 business			1
anger : deputy prime minister @entity2 tore into the @entity10 for leaking ' illegal ' ideas instead of focusing on exit checks and last night @entity24 appeared to agree that , under the @entity6 ’s current free movement rules , a cap would be unlawful			1
asked whether @entity29 agreed that a cap on overall @entity6 immigration would be ‘ illegal and undeliverable ’ , the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ there are clear free movement laws			2
we have to operate within those			0
’ he added : ‘ as the prime minister has said , do we need to look at free movement ? yes , because , as he said , there should n’t be a freedom to move to claim [ welfare benefits ]			0
” home secretary @entity43 , under heavy fire over the leaked idea , also indicated the idea was open to revision			1
she suggested that , rather than focusing on all @entity6 migrants , the target of any new government crackdown could be new member states			0
but a poll released last night showed mr @entity2 ’s position is not shared by the overwhelming majority of the @entity20 public – and restrictions on free movement of @entity6 workers would be supported			0
in a survey for the @entity59 think tank , only 15 per cent of voters said they were ‘ comfortable ’ with the @entity6 ’s free movement directive and thought it was ‘ good for @entity20 ’			0
tough : senior conservatives including home secretary @entity43 and pm @entity29 have promised further restrictions on immigration tensions are rising at @entity67 , with @entity68 and @entity69 due to get open access to the @entity20 jobs market next month			1
mr @entity2 , at his regular @entity67 press conference yesterday , attacked the idea of a cap			0
he said : ‘ it would be very unwelcome to the 2million or so @entity77 who live and work abroad , who i do n’t think would thank the @entity78 for entering a tit - for - tat race to the bottom where everybody in the @entity6 starts pulling up the drawbridge			2
‘ my advice to the @entity10 is to spend less time leaking policies that are illegal and undeliverable and spend more time delivering on the policies we have agreed as a @entity88 – notably to reinstate exit checks			1
’ an announcement on re-instating the counting of people leaving the @entity20 is expected soon .			0
