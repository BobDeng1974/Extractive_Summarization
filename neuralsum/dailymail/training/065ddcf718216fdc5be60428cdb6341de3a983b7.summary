@entity1 columnists @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 give their expert opinion on the upcoming @entity8 season			1
@entity9 might want to read all the way to the bottom ... which game is the golden ticket ? @entity3 : in terms of teams challenging for the top and the timing of it , @entity14 going to @entity15 with three games to go looks the best game			1
it was pivotal last year and may prove to be again			2
@entity2 : @entity14 v @entity24 , especially with @entity25 adding more stardust			1
you ca n’t beat the animosity between the clubs and the great players			2
@entity24 will be desperate for revenge after losing twice last season			1
revenge mission : @entity34 and @entity24 lost twice to @entity35 's @entity14 last season @entity4 : the @entity37 derbies			1
can @entity38 can permanently wrestle away @entity24 ’s dominance and finish ahead of them two years in a row ? @entity5 : @entity38 against @entity41 at the end of september could be a spicy , attacking game which will be an indicator of where the title goes			1
which manager would you have liked to play for ? @entity5 : @entity49			2
it would have been interesting to play in one of his sides , although i might have had my work cut out defending			2
he ’s one of the few @entity8 managers i saw at the @entity59 , which suggests he is a real student of the game			2
i want to find out what his training methods are and how he has managed to improve @entity64 so much			2
@entity2 : this is hard ! the best manager i played for was my dad , @entity66			2
i ’m a huge admirer of @entity67 and i ’d love to soak up @entity49 ’s experience			2
and now there is @entity71 ! but , despite letting himself down at times last season , i ’d pick @entity9			2
he ’ll be the man lifting the trophy at the end of the season			2
@entity3 : i ’d pick @entity9 , too			2
he is a proven winner , there ’s almost a guarantee of trophies and most players speak highly of him			0
the boss : @entity82 manager @entity49 talks to one of his former charges , @entity1 's @entity4 who can dethrone @entity38 ? @entity2 : i expected @entity38 to kick on in the summer but i still feel they ’re short in defence and need to tie up the signing of @entity88			1
@entity41 should have won the title last season and now with @entity92 and @entity93 , there are no excuses			1
i think they will win it			1
@entity3 : i see @entity38 and @entity41 as the two front runners with @entity82 , @entity14 and @entity24 chasing them			1
but i ’m backing @entity41 to finish top			1
@entity5 : @entity82 have bought interesting players but @entity41 will be strong and i ’d say it is between them and @entity24			1
that may surprise some but being out of @entity102 could really help @entity24			1
@entity4 : @entity38 will win it again			1
i was never able to defend the title — it is very hard — but they have the best squad with the best balance			1
in with a shout : @entity9 's @entity41 are the favourites to overhaul @entity38 who ’s the best signing ? @entity4 : @entity113 — i ’m being biased here ! he was outstanding during the @entity59			1
he has such tenacity and his work rate is infectious			0
@entity3 : who knows yet ? but @entity41 ’s three big signings — @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity119 — look impressive as a package on paper			1
@entity2 : @entity122 looks good at @entity14			1
i watched him for @entity124 last season and he reminded me a bit of @entity127 in the way he ghosted past people			0
it is effortless for him and the winger is happy to have the ball in tight areas			0
@entity5 : i really like @entity113			1
he has great pace and can score both simple and spectacular goals			0
@entity24 wanted him a few years ago			1
the new faces : @entity113 ( left ) and @entity122 will both be exciting additions which player would you buy who has n’t moved yet ? @entity5 : @entity64 ’s @entity142			1
he would really suit @entity24 and has all the attributes to be a top player : physique , touch , vision , confidence			1
@entity2 : i want to see the next best young player and wish it could have been @entity152			0
i ’d go for @entity153			0
he ’d fit in perfectly at @entity14 or @entity82			1
@entity4 : @entity154 , who played up front alongside @entity113 for @entity156 at the @entity59			1
another tireless worker with electric pace			0
@entity3 : @entity160 midfielder @entity159 looks ideally suited to the @entity8			0
he would be expensive , but i would love to see another midfield powerhouse in our league			0
wish you were here : @entity154 ( right ) would be a good addition to the @entity8 can @entity71 take @entity24 from seventh to first ? @entity3 : he will give them the belief that they can challenge straight away			1
yes , he will demand a lot as he ’s a winner but you can already see the benefits			0
but i ca n’t see the title going to @entity178 unless they add more top players			2
i was really impressed by him while on @entity24 ’s @entity183 tour			1
his organisation is excellent and no detail is left to chance			0
it ’s also good to see @entity188 involved as it will be an excellent learning curve for him should he eventually take over			0
@entity2 : we are so narrow - minded in this country and now he ’s going to play 3 - 5 - 2			2
it ’s a great system but people look at him like he ’s from the moon			0
all of a sudden others will copy him			0
i do n’t think @entity24 will win the league because they ’ve lost @entity199 and @entity200 and are a few players short			1
@entity202 four would be a great season			0
@entity4 : he ’ll bring organisation and structure and can restore belief at the club			0
their home record melted away last season and he needs to re-establish it			0
he can make the top four and have a cup run			2
restoring former glories : @entity25 will aim to take @entity24 from seventh back to the top who will surprise us ? @entity2 : everyone is tipping @entity220 for a relegation battle but i think they will be solid			1
yes , they ’ve sold so many stars but there are always talented young players coming through			2
they have an outstanding manager in @entity230 , who has a very clear way of playing			0
their full backs will attack and there will be good movement			0
spurs have not bought many players yet but i rate @entity230 and expect a strong challenge for fourth place			0
they have a squad full of talent			0
@entity5 : @entity243 could do well			0
spurs also have a good squad			0
outstanding : @entity230 can spring a surprise at @entity227 because of his style of play can @entity14 be a force without @entity250 ? @entity4 : you ca n’t lose a player of that quality and be a better team			1
they need to sign another striker			0
there ’s a lot of pressure on @entity67 to prove the last campaign was not a one - season wonder			2
@entity3 : they ca n’t replace @entity250 and it is evident that when @entity265 gets injured , they will need more firepower			1
buying so many players means that one or two will fail to live up to their price tag			0
the majority of @entity67 ’ first - choice @entity270 will be from last season ’s team			2
@entity5 : they ’ve bought some interesting players but @entity250 was special — even though it was right to sell him			1
the demands of the @entity278 will make it difficult for @entity14 to replicate their league form of last season			1
@entity2 : to lose your superstar is so tough			0
maybe they should have bought a big - name striker like @entity153 as a direct replacement			1
i worry there is so much pressure on @entity290			0
the expectation is very different from at @entity220 — i know that having played for both teams			0
pressure : @entity290 will attempt to fill the gap left by @entity250 ( right ) do you have a message for any one player ? @entity2 : @entity34			1
he has the chance to be captain for club and country			0
@entity303 captains are like royalty in this country so he needs to behave himself and score goals			1
enjoy it , embrace it , you ’re not a kid any more			0
@entity3 : @entity313 ’s problem is not smoking or other behaviour off the pitch , it ’s getting in the team ahead of @entity317			2
@entity313 needs the kind of season @entity317 had last year and to become a leader			0
@entity4 : @entity320 and @entity321 have a huge opportunity to finally kick on with @entity200 and @entity199 gone			2
they need to prove they have futures with @entity24 and @entity303			1
@entity71 can make them better players			0
are they any worse than @entity330 ’s centre halves ? no. @entity5 : i ’d tell @entity332 to play with confidence			0
it ’s such a shame to see because he looks like he is a lad who wants to do well			0
play with confidence : @entity332 looks as if he still wants to do well but it is n't happening so , then where should we be putting our money ? @entity4 : @entity38			1
@entity5 : @entity41 @entity3 : @entity41 @entity2 : @entity41			1
@entity3 and @entity2 will again be a key part of @entity342 ’ coverage this season			0
@entity342 will show more games that matter from the @entity8 , @entity278 and much more			0
