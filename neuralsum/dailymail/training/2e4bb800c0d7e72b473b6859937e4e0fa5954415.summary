the poster child for what @entity1 claim is a @entity4 ' war on women ' lashed out at @entity6 on wednesday in exclusive comments to @entity8 , calling her ' hypocritical ' for defending a child rapist in 1975 and laughing about it in a taped interview			1
former @entity12 @entity4 rep. @entity4 crashed and burned in his 2012 bid for a @entity15 seat , after claiming that exceptions in abortion bans for rape victims were n't necessary because ' if it ’s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			1
' ' but let ’s assume that maybe that did n’t work or something : i think there should be some punishment , ' he said ten weeks before that election , ' but the punishment ought to be of the rapist , and not attacking the child			2
' @entity4 emerged from 18 months of media silence to double down on those comments , and to blast the leading @entity1 presidential contender with a blistering verbal salvo			1
' ' in the process , she de-legitimized the legitimate claims of the 12 - year - old victim and then slandered the victim to justify her tactics			1
' @entity69 was embarrassed ten days ago when the @entity70 published an audio interview from the early 1980s in which she chuckled about representing a man who raped a 12 - year - old girl			1
she knew he was guilty , she said on the recording , but worked the legal system to limit his punishment to ' time served ' – about two months in jail			0
' i had him take a polygraph , which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs , ' she laughed at the time			0
@entity4 is ending his nearly two years of silence after his comments about ' legitmate rape ' ended his @entity15 hopes in @entity12 , pushing a book and attacking @entity6 in the process @entity4 complained to @entity8 about a decades - long pattern of @entity6 making light of sexual assaults by attacking the victims			1
the future first lady ran a legal aid clinic when she took the case in 1975			0
in an affidavit on behalf of @entity98 , who died in 1992 , she described his child victim as ' emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing , ' and wrote that she had a history of ' false accusations			2
' @entity4 pointed to @entity69 's actions during her husband 's 1992 presidential campaign to marginalize women who accused him of sexual abuse , as evidence that establishes a pattern			1
' she hired private investigators to silence those women – ‘ bimbo eruptions ’ in @entity118 – who had been seduced or sexually assaulted by her husband , ' @entity4 told @entity8			1
those cases involved accusations from women including @entity122 , who accused the future president of sexually harassing her , and @entity124 , who leveled charges that he violently raped her			2
' @entity6 , in fact , has made a practice of trashing women with legitimate claims to having been assaulted , ' @entity4 said			1
' i faced a media firestorm for an unclear comment			0
it is the responsibility of the media to make it clear that liberal democrats like @entity69 and @entity6 are the true perpetrators of the ‘ war on women			1
' @entity4 , like @entity69 , is promoting a book – firing back : taking on the @entity141 to @entity142 – due in stores on july 15			1
the book includes a carefully parsed defense of his ' legitimate rape ' comment to a television station that doomed his 2012 campaign and brought even @entity4 presidential candidate @entity151 out of the woodwork to chastise him			1
' when a woman claims to have been raped , the police determine if the evidence supports the legal definition of " rape " , ' @entity4 writes			1
' is it a legitimate claim of rape or an excuse to avoid an unwanted pregnancy ? are the police warranted to take action against a crime or not ? ' ' in short , the word " legitimate " modifies the claim and not the action			2
there have been women who have lied about being raped , as @entity170 did before the @entity172 @entity171			0
the infamous @entity174 decision of 1973 was based on a lie			0
' ' my comment about a woman 's body shutting the pregnancy down , ' @entity4 adds in the book , ' was directed to the impact of stress on fertilization			1
this is something fertility doctors debate and discuss			0
doubt me ? @entity189 " stress and fertilization , " and you will find a library of research on the subject			0
' ' the research is not conclusive , but there is considerable evidence that stress makes conception more difficult			0
and what could be more stressful than a rape ? ' @entity4 told @entity8 that he has n't closed the door on running for office again in the future			2
' i have not ruled out the possibility of running for office again in the future , but it is not on my radar at the moment , ' he said wednesday			0
backlash : @entity4 faced an angry feminist lobby in 2012 after his gaffe became the subject of daily outrage in the press crash and burn : @entity4 's solid lead over sen. @entity218 evaporated , along with much of his public following , after his shocking gaffe about rape and pregnancy that position casts his dissection of his 2012 implosion in a different light			1
he insists , for instance , that he never denied the possibility of pregnancy from forcible rape			2
' in fact , several fantastic young @entity172 who campaigned with me were themselves the products of rape , ' @entity4 writes			2
' and they were thankful i would stand with them			0
' @entity4 's full - contact body slam on @entity6 is about what he sees as a double standard			1
he was pilloried in 2012 for putting his foot in his mouth by answering a hypothetical question , he says , while @entity69 has largely escaped criticism for defending @entity98 , an actual rapist			2
the 12 - year - old victim , now a middle - age woman , told @entity243 last week that ' @entity6 took me through hell , ' adding that she would confront the former secretary of state if she had the chance			1
' i would say [ to @entity69 ] , " you took a case of mine in ' 75 , you lied on me … i realize the truth now , the heart of what you ’ve done to me " , ' she said			0
' and you are supposed to be for women ? you call that [ being ] for women , what you done to me ? and i hear you on tape laughing			0
' assaulter - in - chief ? then - president @entity69 faced questions from reporters in 1999 after @entity124 , an @entity262 woman , accused him of raping her 21 years earlier in a hotel room @entity124 gave an @entity265 interview in 1999 describing what she said was a brutal sexual assault and @entity69 's alleged cavalier attitude afterward ' @entity269 ' : @entity6 helped tamp down national outrage after a string of women , including @entity273 ( pictured ) accused @entity69 of sexual harassment and sexual assault @entity4 writes in ' @entity276 ' that two weeks after his ' legitimate rape ' comment became national news , ' sexual predator ' @entity69 received a standing ovation for his keynote speech at the @entity283			1
at he same convention , he adds , @entity1 memorialized @entity285 , whose @entity287 incident brought charges that he let a young woman he preyed on drown to save his reputation			0
if @entity4 runs again , he 'll need a resurgence of support from @entity295 evangelicals , many of whom abandoned him in the final weeks of the 2012 campaign			2
his book seems calculated , in part , to rebuild that bridge			0
' perhaps one of the greatest opportunities to return to good ideas and refute bad ideas is through the church , ' he writes			0
' churches exist in part to warn people of the bad consequences of bad ideas and teach obedience to @entity314 ’s laws			0
... today , for all the good work our pastors do , many make the mistake of not applying the @entity320 to the critical issues of our day			0
this is probably one of the most urgently needed changes in @entity172			0

@entity4 said in 2012 that abortion bans did n't need to include exceptions for rape victims because ' legitimate rape ' rarely leads to conception
the comment became a national rallying cry for claims of a @entity4 ' war on women ' and caused his campaign to crash and burn
@entity4 is attacking @entity6 in his first interview since the campaign implosion , saying she ' de-legitimized ' a 12 - year - old rape victim by defending her attacker in court
he insists he was right about his ill - fated 2012 comments , and claims there 's a double standard at play that benefits the @entity348
@entity6 , he claims in a new book , ' has made a practice of trashing women with legitimate claims to having been assaulted ' – including shutting down ' bimbo eruptions ' during her husband 's 1992 presidential campaign
