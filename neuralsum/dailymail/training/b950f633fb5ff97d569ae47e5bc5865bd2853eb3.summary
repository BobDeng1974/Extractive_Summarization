speaking at @entity2 's spring conference in @entity5 this afternoon , mr @entity0 told activists that rumours of his demise ' have been greatly exaggerated ' - but invited criticism after failing to unveil any new party policies ahead of the election			1
he claimed political insiders from the main @entity14 parties had started rumours that he had been keeping a low profile because he was suffering a serious illness			1
he told delegates : ' there has been some considerable speculation as to my whereabouts			2
' my absence from the @entity14 scene has even led our opponents to spread some really quite malicious and unpleasant speculation about my health			2
' it 's said i am seriously ill and that 's why i 've not been seen			2
' opinion polls had suggested the @entity2 leader was trailing the conservative candidate in the @entity42 constituency he hopes to win in may			1
but , to cheers in the hall , mr @entity0 hailed a new poll showing he is on course to win comfortably			1
' we 're on our way to winning this seat , ' he predicted			0
mr @entity0 also made clear he has no intention of calling it quits any time soon			1
' we are going to win lots of seats in this general election and i hope very much to be leading this party not just into this general election , but in all the elections to come			1

' schools are now full , hospitals are troubled , healthcare - it is very difficult to be seen in many areas of this country			2
' roads need to be built , we need to look at the way we feed ourselves because of our growing population			0
' what about our water and sewage systems ? all of these matter			0
' mr @entity0 's address came after the @entity2 conference threatened to be overshadowed by a @entity107 - themed troupe of dancers which turned up in @entity5 this morning , dressed in hot pants , jackboots and @entity107 insignia goose - stepping to ' @entity112 '			1
the dancers , from @entity116 's musical @entity114 , caused the scene outside @entity2 's conference venue - the @entity119 in @entity5 , @entity42			1

at the party 's conference today , @entity2 mp @entity154 today warned delegates the party will not grow unless it can shake off the taint of xenophobia and demonstrate it is the ' party of the @entity161 '			1
mr @entity154 , who won a by - election in @entity163 and @entity164 after defecting from the @entity150 , said voters knew @entity2 wanted to leave the @entity166 and cut immigration			1
but the party must ' talk about other things as well ' and reassure people it is not a threat to the @entity161 in order to have wider appeal			0

children were being ' indoctrinated ' to ' confuse their gender identity ' and ' think about and sing songs about same - sex attraction '			0
mr @entity154 told activists : ' there are two things most people know about us - we want to leave the @entity166 , and we want to cut immigration			0
' we should talk about those things			0
but if we want to get beyond 20 per cent - 30 per cent of the vote to the 40 per cent or so we will need to win constituencies , we will have to explain why we want those things , challenge some of the misconceptions there are around our party , and talk about other things as well			2
' speaking in the @entity216 last night mr @entity0 warned the @entity218 gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the conservatives in the @entity68 if they continued to embrace the political centre			1
mr @entity0 slammed @entity224 over his failure to identify the infamous @entity228 executioner ' @entity226			2

' the dancers , from @entity116 's musical @entity114 , caused the scene outside @entity2 's conference venue - the @entity119 in @entity5 , @entity42 @entity0 was upstaged this morning as dancing nazis and a 16 tonne @entity239 crashed @entity2 's conference he also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday 's immigration figures			1
' by sheer coincidence , ' he said , @entity244 's name was published ' on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the @entity68			0
' he also hit out against cage , the @entity68 ngo that often advocates on behalf of radicalized @entity251 and brands their detractors ' islamophobes			0
' ' yes , yes , yes ! ' @entity0 exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most @entity68			2
' it 's politcal correctness ! ' i mean , we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of @entity264 saying and shouting things that – if you and i did them , we 'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order			0
' @entity0 flew to @entity269 to address @entity216 's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen ' we actually have a @entity273 culture , ' he added			1
' it 's actually in our @entity275 , so let 's stand up for it			0
' the thing about us ' is that we have been , of all the @entity280 countries , the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to @entity68			0
