of all the questions asked of the new regime at @entity5 recently , those concerning a new contract for @entity2 are among the most pertinent			1
since sir @entity7 shut his office door behind him for the last time 18 months ago , the @entity5 goalkeeper has perhaps been the club ’s most important player			1
now @entity10 has a recognised no 2 to compete with , in keeping with the modern trend in the @entity12			1
instead of @entity15 makeweight @entity13 , @entity10 will soon have a three - time @entity17 winner and @entity18 international watching him from the substitutes ’ bench			2
@entity21 ( left , in action against @entity5 in 2011 ) will challenge @entity2 at @entity23 @entity10 faces a fight on his hands to keep new signing @entity26 at bay certainly the @entity10 / @entity21 dynamic will be an interesting one over the coming weeks			1
@entity21 has only recently recovered from a serious knee injury but has not signed an 18 - month contract at @entity5 just to pick his nose — to steal a memorable @entity13 quote — and his relationship with manager @entity34 and goalkeeping coach @entity35 is one that stretches back to the day 12 years ago when he was given his debut at @entity39			1
@entity21 will seek to play over the coming weeks but the wider issue — that of @entity10 ’s own future in @entity42 — remains unclear ; his current contract expires at the end of next season , with @entity46 known to be interested			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity47 and @entity10 ’s agent @entity48 have already spoken and it is understood that official meetings are now planned to accelerate the process			1
@entity48 is a friend of the club , but is a friend of @entity46 , too			0
@entity46 need a replacement for @entity55 , who is will be 34 in may , and @entity10 is the outstanding candidate by far			2
for @entity5 , the issue is clear and it is odd that they have not secured one of the world ’s most valuable goalkeepers on a long - term deal already			2
@entity47 says he is ‘ relaxed ’ about the issue , but the lure of @entity46 is understandably strong for @entity10 , and @entity5 can only hope that the expressed preferences of his family prove significant in the weeks to come			2
certainly , when @entity67 spent time talking to former coaches and childhood friends of @entity10 in october , the indications were that both the player and his parents are content in @entity42			2
the @entity73 has established himself as the first - choice keeper at @entity5 in truth , dad @entity75 and mum @entity76 , who live with @entity10 in the city , now enjoy a stress - free @entity80 lifestyle and have little desire to see @entity10 return to the spotlight of the @entity18 game			1
as one source close to the family said : ‘ they are super-happy in @entity42			0
if it was all up to them , they would prefer for him to stay here			0
‘ in @entity18 , there would be huge pressure			0
you have four newspapers per day devoted to @entity46 and @entity39 , invading your privacy			0
to replace @entity55 for both @entity18 and @entity46 — can you imagine the scrutiny he would face ? ’ @entity97 has no doubts about @entity21 ’s quality			0
indeed , @entity35 spoke glowingly about him last summer			0
@entity21 ( centre ) watches @entity5 play @entity101 at @entity23 back in october @entity21 ( left ) works out , wearing a @entity103 snood , with @entity5 's first - choice keeper @entity2 ‘ @entity21 is a goalkeeper , but he is also the 11th outfield player and able to construct moves , ’ @entity35 told a @entity106 newspaper			1
‘ ( @entity110 ) @entity109 at @entity101 , for example , has composure but he does not have this ability			0
’ certainly @entity21 is not in @entity42 for a watching brief			0
he will challenge @entity10 and that is how @entity97 wants it			0
just this week @entity21 has been looking for accommodation in @entity117 , where he will join the enclave of @entity18 that includes @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity10			2
an 18 - month contract seems generous for a player who has only just recovered from such a serious injury and that would appear to suggest there was some competition from elsewhere for his signature ; a more machiavellian view would be that @entity5 are merely covering themselves in case @entity10 ’s contract talks do n’t go well			1
there have been suggestions that @entity5 are prepared to make the @entity73 the best - paid goalkeeper in the world in order to keep him			1
they may well have to			0
goalkeeper @entity13 ( left ) could be allowed to return to @entity15			0

@entity21 to sign 18 - month contract with @entity12 club
the @entity73 will rival *compatriot* @entity2 for the no 1 shirt
@entity5 are set to step up contract talks with @entity10 to tie up his future
