ancient rock etchings along a dried - up lake bed in @entity3 have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in @entity5 , scientists said			1
the petroglyphs , which date back at least 10,000 years , were found on limestone boulders near @entity8 in northern @entity3 's high desert			1
the carvings are abstract with tightly clustered geometric designs including diamond patterns and short parallel lines on top of a longer line , but no - one knows who carved them			1
petroglyphs , which date back at least 10,000 years , have been found on limestone boulders near @entity8 in northern @entity3 's high desert ( pictured )			1
the rock etchings have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in @entity5 , scientists said the etchings are similar in design to some found at a lake in @entity25 that are believed to be at least 7,600 years old			1
later drawings sometimes depict a spear or antelope instead of abstract patterns			2
the oldest petroglyphs were found on the @entity32 's reservation land			2
@entity33 , the curator of anthropology at the @entity35 in @entity36 who co-authored a paper on the findings , said : ' we initially thought people 12,000 or 10,000 years ago were primitive , but their artistic expressions and technological expertise associated with these paints a much different picture			0
' his research is published in the @entity47			0
geochemist @entity48 , who used radiocarbon testing to date the etchings , believes the petroglyphs could be as much as 14,800 years old			2
the oldest petroglyphs ( pictured ) were found on the @entity32 's reservation land			2
later drawings sometimes depict a spear or antelope instead of abstract patterns radiocarbon testing dated the carbonate layer underlying the petroglyphs to roughly 14,800 years ago			2
geochemical data , sediment and rock samples from adjacent @entity8 show they were exposed to air from 13,200 to 14,800 years ago and again from 10,500 to 11,300 years ago			0
' whether they turn out to be as old as 14,800 years ago or as recent as 10,500 years ago , they are still the oldest petroglyphs that have been dated in @entity5 , ' said @entity48 , a national research scientist emeritus for the @entity64 and curator of anthropology at the @entity68 @entity67 in @entity69			0
@entity70 , an archaeologist with the @entity72 's @entity71 , called it a significant discovery			0
he led recent excavations of obsidian spear points near @entity77 , @entity25 , that he dated back 13,200 years , and noted that the bigger challenge is identifying who created the petroglyphs			0
nobody knows who created the etchings but some believe they show meteorological patterns , while others simply say they are amazing patterns created by @entity88 thousands of years ago			1
a @entity89 dressed in traditional regalia is pictured ' when you get back into this time period , if you speak with @entity88 they will tell you they were made ( created ) there and that is obviously their people and their artwork , ' @entity70 said			0
' but approaching it from a scientific point of view - what we can prove - at this point , it is impossible to connect these to any tribal group			0
' @entity105 , a longtime archaeologist for the @entity107 @entity106 who discovered the petroglyphs at @entity109 in @entity25 , brought the @entity3 site to @entity112 's attention years ago			1
he said they bore similarities to petroglyphs at nearby @entity116 and @entity112 began connecting the dots			0
the etchings in @entity3 and @entity25 have relatively deep , carved lines dominated by linear , curved and circular geometrical designs			1
researchers have suggested the etchings represent various meteorological symbols , such as clouds and lightning and even perhaps the @entity126			1
' but we really have nothing to go on for these particular petroglyphs that go back 10,000 or more years , ' @entity112 said .			0

@entity107 scientists found the petroglyphs on limestone boulders near @entity8 in northern @entity3 's high desert
the carvings are abstract with tightly clustered geometric designs including diamond patterns and short parallel lines
one theory suggests the etchings represent meteorological symbols but others think they are old patterns created by native americans
