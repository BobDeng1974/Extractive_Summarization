snooze who ? @entity15 , 24 , took the intimate collection of portraits while studying at @entity18 @entity25 diary : to determine who her absolute best friends were , she decided to photograph only the ones who she 'd known well enough to share a bed with just good friends : her subjects include friends both male and female in various stages of undress - but only one with whom she had a sexual relationship			1
