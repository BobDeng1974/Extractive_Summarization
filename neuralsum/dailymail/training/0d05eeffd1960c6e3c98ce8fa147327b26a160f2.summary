the @entity6 ran a dedication to @entity8 on thursday paying tribute to his ' friendly ' nature and community work			1
but when mourners rang to pay their respects to mr @entity8 's family , they were surprised to hear him answer the phone			1
the confusion arose when the newspaper was told a man named @entity8 , of @entity21 , died earlier this month and his funeral was due to take place this afternoon			1
@entity8 said he was able to see the funny side after his obituary was published in a local newspaper it then ran the obituary to mr @entity8 , 81 , of @entity21 , @entity28 , along with a photograph , when in fact it was an 84 - year - old namesake who had died			1
mr @entity8 is well known in the town for his involvement in local football and the article included a tribute from a referee			1

mr @entity8 said : ' i 'm still alive			1
the phone has n't stopped all morning , i 've had to go out to get away from it			0
' my cousin read it and he informed his two sisters in @entity49 that i 'd died , but now he knows i 'm still here so he 's getting back in contact with them to give them the news			2
' it 's been a terrible mix up			0
the obituary in the paper says i 'm 85 , but i 'm 81			0
i 'm ageing every day			0
' the man who died was aged 84 i believe			2
i can take it and i see the funny side			0
people have said i 'm the best looking corpse they 've seen			0
' but i do feel sorry for the family of @entity8 who has died			1
i do n't know them but he lives on the other side of town			2
' i 'm a bit worried that people who know me will turn up at the funeral			0
' the paper has apologised and are going to print something to clear everything up			0
' the @entity6 mistakenly ran an obituary to the wrong @entity8 in thursday 's newspaper mr @entity8 , a former @entity76 electrician , won an ' @entity78 ' award for his dedication to local football in 2011			1
the obituary detailed mr @entity8 's involvement in the @entity83 and @entity84 over 45 years			2

' friendly ? beyond question			0
@entity96 ? @entity8 was such a good - hearted chap that he would n't even include goal difference in the league tables he sent to the papers			2
' " it disheartens those who concede a lot , " he said			0
' the @entity103 has contacted the @entity6 for comment .			2
