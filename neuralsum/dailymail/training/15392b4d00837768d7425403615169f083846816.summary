by @entity0 published : 21:26 est , 29 november 2012 updated : 07:31 est , 30 november 2012 @entity1 : one of @entity4 artist @entity3 's scarily realistic dolls with her sparkling blue eyes , long red locks and pretty bow she looks just like a normal little girl			1
it 's hard to believe that she wo n't start running around causing mischief or playing with the toy that she clutches			0
but the little red - head is actually a scarily realistic doll created by @entity4 artist @entity3			1
the doll is one of a collection of intricately crafted unique creations which normally fetch between 450 and 1,350 euros each			1
hardly a crying , walking living doll and a far cry from the @entity24 dolls of old , the creations are not advertised as toys but as collectors items			0
each child takes @entity3 around two weeks to craft and can not be replicated - they are not made using a mould			2
made from a malleable polymer resin , the dolls are cooked rather like ceramics with limbs and faces fashioned from acrylic			1
@entity3 painstakingly shapes each child 's facial expression - the hardest part to make she says - and seems to have a penchant for freckles			2
the eyes are made of glass and the hair either from mohair or real hair			0
as well as the dolls themselves , she also pays great attention to crafting unique cloths and shoes - with each child dressed in classical clothing			0
living doll : artist @entity3 seems to have a predilection for creating dolls with red hair and freckles collectable : the dolls more often than not carry their own toy , but the creation on the left is a rare example of one without a doll of its own she said : ' my aim is to give emotion			1
i am very sensitive to expressions like delicacy , timidity , surprise and tenderness			0
' the dolls range from newborn to nursery school age with ' mini-bebes ' starting at eight inches long and the biggest creations standing at an almost lifelike 22 inches tall			0
@entity82 in @entity4 , who only makes a handful of the dolls each year , was a portrait painter until she discovered her love for creating the lifelike children 12 years ago			1
she now says that it is her favourite art medium			0
range : the dolls come in a selection of different sizes and ages - with newborn baby dolls , children of nursery school age and boys and girls @entity101 : the dolls come with a range of uniquely crafted facial expressions			2

@entity3 , of @entity106 , @entity4 , starting creation the polymer resin dolls 12 years ago
she *spends* two weeks *beautifully* *handcrafting* each one with its own unique expression
the dolls fetch between 450 and 1,350 euros and come in a range of ages and sizes
