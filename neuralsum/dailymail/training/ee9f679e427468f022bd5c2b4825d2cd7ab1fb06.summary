by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 20:29 est , 14 december 2013 the tv adverts would have you believe that meerkats keep warm with a stylish combination of silk cravat and crushed - velvet dressing gown			2
but in real life , the mammals can go to acrobatic extremes to escape the cold – especially when , like these three , they are facing winter in a @entity12 zoo rather than in their native @entity13			2
the pictures show one of the intrepid creatures displaying the dexterity of a circus trapeze artist to scramble into position beneath a heat lamp			1
and once there , he makes himself at home , exposing his belly to its comforting rays			0
brr ! it 's a bit cool for @entity27			0
the wily creature looks at the heat lamp and an idea forms i 'm meerly looking for some heat : the meerkat clambers up onto the lamp 's frame meerkats have a patch on their tummy which is only sparsely covered in hair , exposing the black skin beneath which acts like a solar panel , absorbing the heat after a cold desert night			1
simples , as @entity47 ’s elegantly dressed mascot @entity45 would surely say			0
this trio was captured in action by photographer @entity50 on a trip to @entity52 at @entity53 , @entity54			1
@entity55 ! it 's not as simples as it looks compared with you meerkats , i 'm baking			0
the creature enjoys the heat from his new perch			1
