newlyweds @entity0 and @entity2 got more than they bargained during a game drive on their @entity6 in @entity8			2
the honeymooners , from @entity10 , were on a game drive when a cheetah got a little too close for comfort - jumping on the car and peering through the open sunroof			1
the couple had been happily observing the family of cheetahs when the big cats decided to use the car as a perch so they could get a better view of their surroundings			2
but one cheetah became more interested in the contents of the car than the surrounding plains , peering through the sunroof and , at one moment , looking like it may even try to get inside			1
as @entity2 stayed stock still looking at the animal from the back seat , the big cat looked right back , before appearing to lose interest			0
the trip involves travelling through the @entity6 with a mobile camp of just six tents , following the migration and wildlife movement around the @entity6			0
guests have the opportunity to camp and dine under the stars of the @entity53 in the @entity6 , while always being positioned in an exceptional wildlife area			0
the nature of the safari means holidaymakers can venture further away from other tourists and often get much closer to the animals			0
