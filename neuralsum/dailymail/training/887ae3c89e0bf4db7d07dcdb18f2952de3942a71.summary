by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 10 august 2013 it looks more suited to a role in a @entity4 movie than to patrolling the nation ’s motorways			0
this is the @entity8 , a police pursuit vehicle that can reach speeds of 155mph – meaning it could theoretically cover @entity12 ’s 50 miles of motorway in under 20 minutes			1
but so far , the £ 30,000 hatchback has been used mostly to track down uninsured or stolen cars on the speed - restricted roads in the genteel towns and villages of the @entity19 and surrounding areas			1
for those in any doubt , the word ‘ interceptor ’ is emblazoned across the front , back and sides			0
the vehicle currently cruising @entity12 is a prototype that is being shared among the country ’s police forces before orders are invited			1
@entity44 spokesman @entity43 called it ‘ jaw - dropping ’ and warned that young drivers could see it as a challenge			0
kitted out : the car is based on the @entity27 but has been tweaked and enhanced and kitted out with cameras to make it fit for police work similar : the new @entity12 police car has drawn comparisons with an interceptor car featured in the @entity4 films keeping the law : @entity58 pictured driving his interceptor in the mad max films ‘ i ’m not sure what motorists would think if they saw that looming into view , ’ he said			1
‘ probably “ slow down ”			0
you almost expect a net to come out of the boot and tyre shredders out of the wheels			0
i ’ve never seen a real police car with “ interceptor ” on it			1
comparisons : a poster for the 1979 @entity4 film featuring the interceptor car ' i hope it would n’t prove a red rag to a bull and a challenge for some of the real tearaways who might try to take it on			2
’ the 1979 @entity4 movie starred @entity58 as a police officer in a post-apocalyptic future , and featured a blisteringly fast police car with ‘ interceptor ’ written prominently across it			1
posters featured @entity58 and one of the @entity92 with the headline : ‘ the last law in a world gone out of control			0
pray that he ’s out there somewhere			0
’ but police insist the interceptor is a serious crime - busting tool – not a macho gimmick			2
a spokesman for @entity23 said : ‘ we ’re delighted with it			0
there is a lot of interest in it			0
this interceptor is equipped with @entity111			0
' officers can drive the car on any road in the county and scan licence plates with the special @entity111 camera			1
‘ if the number plate reveals the car has a police marker on it , has been used in crimes previously or is uninsured , the officers can stop the vehicle and carry out a search			1
’ a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ it is equipped with a front - facing , rear - facing and an interior camera pointing at anyone sat in the rear of the vehicle			2
' it continues recording after the vehicle ignition is turned off to capture essential post-incident footage			0
’ the high - visibility interceptor on trial is based on the @entity8 125d @entity141 diesel sports hatch - back			2
however , police forces are also testing out an unmarked or ‘ stealth ’ version of the interceptor based on the even more powerful m 135i petrol version which will be used for a combination of undercover operations and some low - profile traffic duties			1
the interceptor has been created by the @entity152 car - maker ’s specialist ‘ @entity153 ’ and has been designed to meet demand for fast but smaller police pursuit vehicles which are not left trailing when suspects in tiny vehicles try to give them the slip by going down tight alleyways or between bollards			1
special equipment fitted includes hi - tech ‘ evidential camera ’ systems to catch speeding motorists , bad drivers , and criminal activity – as well as read the number - plate using @entity111 ( @entity111 ) technology			1
it is also fitted with specialist sporty ‘ @entity176 ’ options including black kidney grilles and black wheels and streamlined styling			2
for police work @entity8 said the interceptor is fitted with an emergency warning system designed for a ‘ high local impact ’ with additional blue lights and a siren system featuring ‘ enhanced penetration capabilities			1
’ the bright high - impact livery is designed to ‘ disrupt criminal behaviour			0
the @entity8 has now moved on to @entity186 which has taken deliver ahead of its own trials			0
@entity186 said they will be displaying the car to the public at @entity191 at @entity192 on sunday between 10am and 4pm .			2

the £ 30,000 car is based on the @entity27 available in showrooms
but it has been tweaked and fitted with a camera for police work
the car could cover @entity12 's motorway in under 20 minutes
the car is a prototype being shared among country 's police forces
