probe : the man who handed himself in to authorities in @entity3 has facial similarities with reconstructions of how @entity6 may now look , the family said this young man could be missing @entity9 @entity8 , @entity11 authorities have revealed			1
@entity6 was just two went he went missing from his family while they where holidaying in @entity14 , in 1991			1
but after 22 years , police have called for dna tests on the member of a @entity19 family living in @entity3 who they claim could be the long - lost child			1
police have even handed @entity6 's mother @entity22 an image of the tall , blue - eyed man they are testing , with light brown hair , wearing a blue and white striped rugby top			1
there is also a video of the 22 - year - old man , which has been viewed by authorities			2
the man came to the attention of the @entity11 police when he fled the mainland with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service			0
after seeing the image , @entity22 , 41 , told the @entity38 that she believes the man in the photograph could be @entity6 , who would now be aged 23			1
she said : ' i ’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how @entity6 might now look			0
' as a family we ’re greatly lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the @entity11 authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress			0
' we ’ve never given up hope of finding @entity6 and we are encouraged that the police in @entity53 are continuing to investigate			2
' the image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the @entity57 in @entity14			2
breakthrough : @entity6 , pictured left , has never been found but new images and a video show a @entity19 man with light brown hair and blue eyes , as in the artist 's impression above , right			1
police want to find and dna test him @entity68 , the president the association , realised the potentially explosive nature of the images and handed them to @entity73 , the area 's @entity74			2
the video clip shows a man @entity11 sources say is between 20 and 25 , with four other men from the @entity19 community , attending a church service in @entity82 , @entity3			1
it was published with the photograph on @entity11 news site @entity85			0
the development has been described as ' highly significant ' by @entity11 police , who are now expected to work with their @entity3 colleagues to track down the man and establish his identity			2
@entity6 disappeared on july 24 , 1991 , while his grandparents @entity94 and @entity95 were looking after him in the @entity11 resort			0
hope : @entity8 's mother @entity22 , right , pictured on @entity14 with her mother @entity98 , left , said she has been ' lifted ' by the breakthrough despite a move by @entity11 police to excavate land in @entity14 in a bid to uncover @entity6 's body , his mother @entity22 has refused to believe that her son died after being taken			1
last year , officers from @entity109 police travelled to the island to conduct their own land search , but no major new leads emerged			0
the case bears strong links to the tale of little ' @entity116 ' , the four - year - old blonde girl who was found living with @entity53 this month , after allegedly being ' trafficked '			2
it has since emerged that she is the daughter of a @entity120 woman called @entity121 after dna tests proved biological link			0
mrs @entity121 , 35 , claimed she handed her daughter over to a @entity19 family after she gave birth in @entity53 and could not afford to register the new born			1
but she and her husband @entity127 , 37 , could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold @entity116 for profit			0
regardless of the conclusion , the evidence of @entity133 having acquired children who are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children could have ended up in the impoverished communities			0
@entity116 's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery			0
disappearance : @entity6 's family were on a trip to @entity14 , above , in 1991 when the toddler went missing search goes on : @entity150 , above , travelled to @entity14 last year to conduct their own search for missing @entity6 covering old ground : the officer 's search was without success but the new breakthrough has been welcomed by @entity6 's mother @entity22 @entity158 and @entity159 were alerted to the case after police in @entity162 agreed to reopen their investigation into missing @entity164			1
authorities in @entity166 too , seized two children from a @entity19 family to two test if they were living with their biological parents			1
in both cases , police suspected that the children , a seven - year - old girl from @entity175 and two - year - old @entity176 from @entity177 , might be victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike the rest of their immediate family			0
tests have since shown that both children were living with their real parents			0
pictured : the case has echoes of the story of young ' @entity116 ' , above , who was found to be living with a @entity19 family last week			1
her biological mother has now been discovered in @entity120			0
