by @entity0 if you believe @entity3 is going to put himself at the mercy of a late - night comic , we 've got a bridge to sell you			1
@entity8 said today that the @entity10 governor is booked to appear on @entity12 's tonight show on thursday , alongside comic @entity13 and musician @entity14			1
@entity3 is no stranger to late - night television			1
he appeared on @entity18 's @entity17 three times before the star took over tonight in february			1
@entity10 gov. @entity3 pictured speaking in @entity21 , @entity10 in january but this is his first foray into late - night comedy since the story about lane closures on the @entity26 became a problem for the @entity29 governor			2
the governor had been accused of making his staff intentionally clog traffic near the @entity26 to punish a political adversary			0
beginning on september 9 , 2013 , three lanes leading from the town of @entity36 to the bridge 's toll booths were choked into a single - file line , with the other toll lanes serving other bridge traffic			0
the resulting backup snarled traffic in the town , delayed school buses and first responders , and led to the death of an elderly woman			0
@entity49 visited @entity51 starring @entity12 at @entity52 last week the @entity29 strongly maintains he never had any knowledge that the bridge closing was orchestrated by staffers in his own office - and certainly never ordered the closing			0
@entity3 was photographed at a 9/11 memorial event in @entity59 that day and insisted he had no knowledge of any plot regarding the bridge until january			2
however , the scandal damaged @entity3 's brand			1
he had been considered an early front - runner for the 2016 @entity29 presidential nomination before @entity69			0
now , his name comes up in conversation considerably less .			0
