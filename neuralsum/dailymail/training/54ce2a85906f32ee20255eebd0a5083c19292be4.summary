by @entity0 @entity1 will present @entity2 with an unprecedented £ 100million transfer hit - list this summer			1
the @entity2 manager ’s bold statement of the players he wants to restore his team to greatness will test owners the @entity12 family ’s eagerness to share his ambitions for the club			1
top targets for @entity1 are @entity17 midfield pair @entity16 and @entity18 , together valued at around £ 60m and an indication of the @entity2 manager ’s current anxiety about the part of his team that has consistently failed to produce this season			1
shopping spree : @entity2 boss @entity1 will present his bosses with a £ 100m wish - list this summer chasing : @entity17 midfielders @entity16 ( above ) and @entity18 ( below ) are @entity1 ' top targets @entity1 has also earmarked @entity29 , of @entity30 , and @entity32 teenager @entity31 as he tries to freshen up an ageing defence			1
and he will follow up his long - standing interest in @entity37 ’s 25 - year - old @entity36 international striker @entity35			1
the list is certain to test @entity2 executive vice-chairman @entity40 ’s ability to wheel and deal			2
big spenders : @entity18 and @entity16 could cost @entity2 £ 60m to bring to @entity44 deals : executive vice chairman @entity40 ( left ) is the man behind the deals at @entity2 if @entity1 has found it difficult in the shadow of sir @entity48 , @entity40 has no less daunting a job to succeed former chief executive @entity51 , who , like @entity48 , is still very much a presence at @entity44			1
@entity40 ’s biggest problem will not be financing the transfers			0
if @entity2 do not finish in the @entity57 ’s top four this season , @entity55 will have to persuade players to give up their @entity60 ambitions for at least a year and that will not be easy			2
an accountant , @entity40 arrived at @entity2 after representing the @entity64 owners during their successful 2005 takeover			0
he made his mark as a successful head of commercial operations but @entity70 ’s decision to stand down propelled @entity55 into an entirely different role , negotiating with rival club executives and players ’ agents			0
the recent acquisition of £ 37m @entity76 from @entity77 was a step in the right direction			0
goalscorer : @entity37 striker @entity35 is another player on @entity1 ' list hot property : @entity31 ( right ) - who is a target for a number of clubs - could be a ready made replacement for @entity87 if proof was needed that @entity1 intends to be his own man and stand or fall by his ability to make @entity2 the best in @entity92 , it is in his pursuit of @entity18			1
still only just 20 , the @entity95 midfielder was in the @entity44 youth set - up after switching from @entity97 in controversial circumstances			0
but his departure to @entity17 in 2012 was even more controversial , especially after sir @entity48 had predicted a tremendous future for him			0
since then @entity18 has blossomed into one of @entity92 ’s top young prospects			0
@entity2 would now have to fork out £ 30m for someone they let go 18 months ago for nothing			0
his @entity17 team - mate @entity16 , a 26 - year - old @entity107 international , is valued even higher			2
he joined from @entity108 for £ 10m in 2011 and was voted player of the year after his major role in @entity17 ’s second successive title triumph last season			0
transition : @entity30 's @entity29 ( left , on the right ) could step into the shoes of the departing @entity116 @entity116 ’s decision to leave @entity2 has heightened @entity1 ’s need for at least one central defender and @entity29 fits the bill			1
@entity2 were among several clubs , including @entity77 , @entity122 and @entity123 at the @entity30 - @entity125 match on thursday when the @entity126 international played in his team ’s 2 - 1 win			2
@entity2 also face competition for @entity31 and @entity35			1
but the ball will be firmly in @entity40 ’s court when the transfer treasure hunt begins in earnest .			0

@entity1 will hand in a £ 100m shopping list to his @entity44 bosses
the @entity139 wants to make a bold statement that shows he wants to restore @entity2 to their former *glory*
@entity17 pair @entity16 and @entity18 are the top targets
an ageing defence will be freshened up with @entity31 and @entity30 's @entity29 on the list
@entity37 striker @entity35 is the final man on @entity1 ' list
