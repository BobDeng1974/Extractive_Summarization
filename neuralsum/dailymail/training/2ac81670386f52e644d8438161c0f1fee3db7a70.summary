by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 20:52 est , 30 april 2012 the potentially deadly exotic caterpillars invading @entity3 are unstoppable , an expert warned yesterday			1
oak processionary moths , which are highly toxic pests during their caterpillar stage , have spread into new areas of the country			2

fears : the oak processionary moth caterpillar is highly toxic and have spread into new areas of the country if this happens , millions of spectators could come into contact with poisonous hairs on the caterpillars that contain powerful toxins			1
each caterpillar is covered in 63,000 of these hairs , which can trigger potentially lethal asthma attacks			1
the bristles can blow off in the wind and cause painful skin and throat rashes , running eyes , vomiting , dizziness and fever if you come into contact with them			0
spreading : the oak processionary moth loses its toxicity once it has turned into a moth as seen here @entity41 , head of the arboretum at @entity43 , said the pest was resilient to bad weather and difficult to eradicate			2
‘ we use spray to keep them at bay but even the nest removals at @entity51 do n’t totally control oak processionary moths , ’ he said			0
‘ you can slow them down but we will never find them all			2
they will always keep increasing			0
’ the creatures can usually be spotted in oak trees , where they strip off the leaves before turning into moths			1
swarm : the oak processionary moth caterpillars have been found on trees at @entity43 in south west @entity12 they first appeared in @entity3 in 2006 , after they were brought into @entity12 on a batch of oak trees imported from @entity69			1
since then they have spread rapidly across the @entity71 and have been spotted as far afield as @entity72 and @entity73			0
it is feared that the pest will be prevalent throughout the @entity71 within five years			0
in @entity77 , the situation became so bad that the army was sent in to incinerate the caterpillars ’ nests – but officials here have no such plans .			0
