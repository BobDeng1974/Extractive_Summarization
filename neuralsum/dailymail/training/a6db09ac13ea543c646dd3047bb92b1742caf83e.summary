thirty years ago today , @entity8 's lowest ever temperature was recorded near @entity9 , @entity10 - with the mercury falling to a staggering -26.1c ( -15f )			1
pictures taken from the same point three decades later tell a dramatically different story - with a daytime temperature yesterday of 10.4c ( 51f ) as the country continues to enjoy one of the mildest winters in recent memory			1
freezing : a stunning picture of country lanes in @entity9 , @entity10 taken on january 10 , 1982 , when the temperature dropped below -26c a @entity25 spokesman said the daytime temperature in the nearby towns of @entity28 and @entity29 was even warmer - 11.2c ( 52f ) - yesterday			1
@entity30 noted the record - breaking low temperature at a weather station near @entity28 , on january 10 , 1982 , and says he remembers the day vividly			1
' i had frost on my eyelashes , ' the former @entity25 worker recalled			0
' i knew it was cold that day , but it came as quite a shock when i saw it was -26.1c			2
' it had snowed the night before , but had cleared up and it was a lovely day - just bitterly , bitterly cold			0
' that fiercely cold winter of 1982 saw one of the most disruptive snowstorms on record - with gale force winds and severe blizzards across southern @entity8 , the @entity47 and @entity48			1
balmy : the same lane yesterday when the temperature was a pleasant 10.4c as the country experiences one the mildest winters in recent memory thirty years later , things could hardly be different - with forecasters saying there is no sign of a blanket of snow or a big freeze for at least the next couple of weeks			2
the mild weather can be seen in every corner of the @entity6 countryside , with snowdrops already blooming and daffodil shoots bravely starting to appear			0
@entity25 spokeswoman @entity68 said : ' the mild westerly flow from the @entity70 has been unimpeded - allowing milder @entity70 air and changeable , often stormy , conditions to take charge			0
' the @entity10 record is viewed by many experts as an odd one for the county as its climate is generally moderate with an average minimum temperature of just 5.20c			2
