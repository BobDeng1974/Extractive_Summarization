@entity1 chief constable @entity0 was serving as a detective sergeant in @entity3 when allegations surfaced against @entity6 mp @entity5 in 1989 police chiefs blocked a paedophile probe into a top politician 25 years ago , one of the country ’s most senior officers said yesterday			1
@entity1 chief constable @entity0 was serving as a detective sergeant in @entity3 when allegations surfaced against @entity6 mp @entity5 in 1989			1
mr @entity0 said he was ordered to limit his inquiries into the mp , now @entity5 of @entity16			1
he was forbidden from arresting the politician or searching his home , despite ‘ credible evidence ’ that warranted further investigation			1
the chief constable said the message was passed on by a superintendent , but he believes it came from higher up			2
‘ the decision was clear , he will be interviewed by appointment and there wo n’t be a search of his home , his constituency office or his office in the @entity36 , ’ he said , adding : ‘ it was a decision made by people more senior than me			0
’ his comments are likely to fuel widespread dissatisfaction with the way allegations against @entity5 were originally handled			2
the claims surfaced during an investigation into @entity43 , the manager of @entity46 children ’s homes , who died in jail after being convicted of abusing boys in his care			1
one former care home resident alleged that he had a two - year sexual relationship with the mp when he was a teenager in the 1970s			1
the alleged victim later caused controversy when he aired his claim while giving evidence at @entity43 ’s trial in 1991			2
when the allegations became public , the jury was told they were a ‘ red herring ’ and irrelevant			0
the police inquiry was limited to an interview at @entity3 police headquarters during which @entity5 gave ‘ no comment ’ answers			2
a file was sent to the @entity68 , which decided there was insufficient evidence to bring charges			0
@entity5 of @entity16 ( right ) has denied claims he historically abused children mps on all sides rallied around @entity5 when he spoke in the @entity36 to condemn the claims and say they did not contain a ‘ shred of truth ’			1
but the witness was able to produce affectionate letters allegedly from the mp , some on @entity36 notepaper			0
he also gave a detailed description of the inside of his home			0
mr @entity0 said there were concerns about the credibility of the evidence against @entity5 , including the veracity of the key witness			1
but he added : ‘ i look at this now , as a chief constable , as a senior investigating officer , in the light of many inquiries before and since – and one of the lines of inquiry could have been to search the house			1
‘ my view was always that the allegations were very serious , there was enough evidence to put a file before the @entity68 , and as investigating officers our job was to search out as much evidence as possible to prove or disprove the offence			2
my interpretation of the @entity112 would be that under the circumstances it would have been justified to search the house and offices			0
’ @entity5 , who represented @entity116 and then @entity117 for 27 years , was made a life peer on his retirement from @entity120 in 1997			0
the father - of - three , who is now 86 , has repeatedly strongly denied the allegations against him			0
he is currently at the centre of a new inquiry by the @entity3 force called @entity126 , which has led to warrants being obtained to search his home in north @entity130 and his office in the @entity132			0
but detectives have been unable to question @entity5 because he is frail and suffering from dementia .			0
