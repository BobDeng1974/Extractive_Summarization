the sexual abuse of a 13 - year - old @entity3 by an adult volunteer was part of a ' sordid history of child sexual abuse ' within the organization that has been documented internally for nearly a century , the victim 's attorney said monday in his opening statement at a civil trial in @entity11			1
the @entity3 , now 20 , has sued the @entity12 and a local scouting council for punitive damages after being molested by a volunteer leader in 2007			2
he claims in his negligence lawsuit that the @entity12 failed to educate , train and warn parents and adult volunteers about the dangers of sex abuse			1
his attorney , @entity22 , won the right to draw from more than 30 years of ' perversion ' files kept by the @entity12 as evidence at trial to support those allegations			1
the files cleared for use by @entity32 superior court judge @entity31 include 16 years of documents — from 1991 to 2007 — that have never been seen before			2
sick : former boy scout leader @entity35 who pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment in 2009			1
previously sealed @entity12 ' perversion ' files spanning 16 years could soon be in the public eye as part of a negligence lawsuit set for trial monday @entity22 told the jury that when they deliberate they will receive a cd of 100,000 pages of files to review and will be the first people in the @entity50 outside @entity3 leadership and attorneys to see the documents			1
@entity22 said in his opening remarks that the @entity12 recorded between 9,000 and 10,000 such files between 1920 and 2007			2
an attorney for the @entity12 put the number at 7,500 ; the discrepancy was n't explained			2
' @entity12 has a long and sordid history of child sexual abuse committed against young scouts			0
committed by @entity3 leaders and that timeline goes back , the files show , until at least the 1920s , ' he said			1
' what has not been going on is notice to the public and notice to ( the plaintiff ) and his parents , ' the lawyer added			0
the plaintiff in the lawsuit testified later in the day that he suffered a bruise and a laceration in the assault at a @entity80 tree lot and still suffers from anxiety , depression and post-traumatic stress disorder			0
he returned to the lot with a hidden tape recorder several days later to try to get a confession and was partially successful , he said , when the volunteer asked the teen if he had told his mother			0
' it was a 13 - year - old 's word over a @entity3 leader , an adult , ' said the victim , who remained composed on the stand			1
' he was someone people looked up to			0
' acknowledgement : the organization acknowledges mistakes in the way sex abuse allegations were handled in the past but now has a robust child protection program , attorney @entity97 said the plaintiff later quit his beloved game of baseball , stopped hanging out with friends and stayed in his room			1
he eventually began home schooling because he saw the volunteer sitting in a car outside his high school about five times as the criminal case proceeded			0
i felt like he was coming after me , ' the victim told jurors , adding that he threw up once in public when he unexpectedly saw the man			1
the victim 's name is being used in court , but the @entity123 does not generally name victims of sexual abuse			1
an attorney for the @entity12 said in his opening statement that the ' perversion ' files were created to keep children safe by maintaining a master list of people ineligible to volunteer with the @entity12			1
the organization acknowledges mistakes in the way sex abuse allegations were handled in the past but now has a robust child protection program , attorney @entity97 said			1
from 2003 to 2007 , a key period for the lawsuit , only 27 adult volunteers were kicked out annually for sexually abusing @entity12 , although there were at least 1.5 million volunteers nationally , he said			1
when the plaintiff was abused , the youth protection training worked because the boy recognized the abuse , resisted and told his mother , @entity97 said			1
she , in turn , told local @entity3 leaders who informed law enforcement			0
' this case is about training and whether training would have made a difference , ' he told jurors			0
' i think this is a case in which the one instance of sexual abuse against ( the plaintiff ) could not have been prevented , and it was n't prevented , ' he said			0
' but the training program may have helped prevent the second or the third instance of sexual abuse			0
' the records allowed by the judge could reveal how much the national organization has improved its efforts to protect children and report abuse after several high - profile cases sparked the youth protection policy in the late 1980s			2
previous large verdicts against the @entity12 focused on cases where alleged abuse occurred before the policy was put in place			0
in 2012 , the @entity180 ordered the @entity12 to make public a trove of files from 1965 to 1985			2
the records showed that more than one - third of abuse allegations never were reported to police and that even when authorities were told , little was done most of the time			0
the current lawsuit alleges that @entity12 volunteer @entity35 , now 37 , pulled down the plaintiff 's pants when he was 13 and fondled him while the two worked in the @entity195 lot			2
@entity35 pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment in 2009 and was sentenced to probation			0
he served time in prison after authorities discovered photos of naked children on his cellphone			0
under the judge 's ruling , records that @entity22 does not use in open court will remain sealed			0
after trial , the plaintiff 's counsel and other interested parties can petition the court for the release of all the files .			2

a former boy scout filed a lawsuit in @entity11 after a troop leader sexually abused him at the age of 13
in the course of the trial , public files will be released to the public that show how the organization has dealt with the issue of sex abuse
