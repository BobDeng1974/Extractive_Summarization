this may not have been enough to persuade the @entity2 powerbrokers to hand @entity3 the manager ’s job on a full - time basis			1
but the coach , taking caretaker charge of @entity2 for the third time , did his chances no harm as the @entity13 club collected a hard - earned point away at @entity15			1
it was n’t pretty ; not that @entity3 will care			2
@entity3 took temporary charge of @entity2 when they traveled to @entity15 on sunday @entity19 was sacked as manager of @entity2 after four months at the helm at the @entity23 club it ’s clear @entity2 ’s players are behind @entity3 ; as they mustered a gutsy performance at @entity27 as if to say : ‘ @entity3 ’s our man ’			1
in confirming he wants to be considered for top job , @entity3 said : ‘ i ’m ready for it , yes			2
‘ the players respect me			2
i ’ve done it enough times			0
now the chairman will decide whether he needs more experience and what names are available			0
it ’s a big decision because it ’s a vital time now			0
‘ i ’ve not been told i ’ve got a chance , i ’ve not spoken to the chairman in regard to myself			0
‘ it ’s not a conversation to have on the day of the game , so i ’m sure i ’ll speak to him tomorrow			2
‘ i ’ve worked with them for two years			0
i know what makes them tick and what bring the best out of them			0
so it will be down to the chairman to make that decision			0
’ @entity54 is deep in thought ahead of his centenary game as manager of @entity15 players line up to acknowledge a minute 's silence for the passengers on the missing @entity61 @entity54 , however , wo n’t be quite as positive as @entity15 toiled against a @entity2 side whose confidence levels were at rock - bottom following the dismal few weeks of @entity19 ’s reign			1
on his big chance to impress @entity67 – who was sat next to close confidant @entity69 – @entity3 ’s first big call was to employ winger @entity71 as a lone centre - forward in an attempt to breathe life into @entity2 ’s misfiring frontline			1
and @entity3 would have been satisfied with his side ’s opening 45 minutes , restricting @entity15 to one long - range @entity78 effort that was comfortably saved by @entity79			1
@entity19 ’s dismissal prevented the veteran manager from returning to @entity15 – the club he led to the @entity83 in 2011 – , but the home supporters were intent on acknowledge their ex-boss as they broke into cries of : ‘ there ’s only one @entity19 , ’ in the 21st minute			1
@entity2 's @entity88 takes on @entity15 ' @entity89 ( left ) and @entity90 ( right ) @entity15 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity91 7 ; @entity92 6.5 , @entity93 6.5 , @entity94 6.5 , @entity89 7 ; @entity95 5 , @entity90 7.5 , @entity96 7 , @entity97 6.5 ( @entity98 65 , 6 ) ; @entity99 6 , @entity100 6 ( @entity101 75 , 6 )			1
subs not used : @entity103 , @entity101 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106			0
booked : @entity89 , @entity96 manager : @entity54 - 6 @entity2 ( 4 - 5 - 1 ) : @entity79 6.5 ; @entity108 7 , @entity109 7.5 , @entity110 7.5 , @entity111 7.5 , @entity112 7 , @entity88 7.5 , @entity113 8 , @entity114 7 , @entity115 6 ; @entity116 6.5 ( @entity117 67 , 6 )			1
subs not used : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124			0
booked : @entity112 manager : @entity3 – 6.5 @entity126 : jedinak @entity127 : 18,011 referee : @entity129 ( @entity130 ) - 6 their good nature would have diminished just a minute later if @entity112 ’s curling effort from the edge of the area had n’t hit @entity91 ’s far post			1
the effort was the highlight of a drab opening 45 minutes ; the encounter having little to offer in terms entertainment value – though the half - time marriage proposal between two @entity15 fans on the pitch helped lift spirits following the woeful first period			2
the female supporter was in tears as she accepted her new fiance ’s hand in marriage ; maybe she was despairing at the prospect of another dire 45 minutes			0
and the second half started much like the first : big on work - rate but little in the way of quality			0
it ’s probably the reason why both sides are looking worryingly at the @entity83 table going into 2015			0
@entity160 went close in the 59th minute , forcing @entity79 into an excellent save before the encounter finally sparked into life			0
@entity91 tipped over another curling effort from @entity112 in the 66th minute before @entity94 , who was target for @entity2 in the summer , thought he made the breakthrough 15 minutes from time , rising above @entity166 to thump a header from @entity96 ’s corner past @entity79 only for @entity88 to produce a brilliant goal line clearance			2
and the visitors came desperately close to claiming victory with virtually the last kick of the game as @entity91 saved @entity112 ’s low drive from 13 yards before @entity2 were denied a penalty as @entity117 fell in the ensuing melee			1
@entity2 winger @entity71 tries to take the game to @entity15 as he is closed down by @entity94 @entity114 drives at @entity94 as he looks to break the deadlock at @entity27 on sunday afternoon @entity2 's @entity112 ( left ) is held off by @entity89 in during the goalless draw at @entity27			1

@entity2 kept at stalemate in their first game since the sacking of @entity19
@entity3 took charge of the team following @entity19 's departure
today marked @entity54 's 100th game as manager of @entity15
@entity2 have now won just one game in their last 13 *fixtures*
