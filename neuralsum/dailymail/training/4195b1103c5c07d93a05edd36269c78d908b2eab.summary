by @entity0 the stars consider @entity2 of fitness trainers			1
his high profile clients include those of the fashion world ( @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 ) , singers ( @entity11 ) and stars of the small screen ( @entity14 ) , not to mention an unnamed royal			2
he has even helped to shape up the country 's political minds with @entity18 ( and his wife @entity19 ) being loyal clients			2
celebrity trainer - @entity2 - has launched a new affordable gym range for @entity22 while not everyone may be able to afford access to @entity2 's personal expertise , he believes that 's no excuse not to get fit			1
he has extended his at - home gym range at @entity22 - having already sold over 109,000 products in the first year of trading - so people can gain fitness equipment they can use at home at affordable prices , starting at £ 7.99 for a skipping rope			1
the range is the latest addition in his fitness empire which includes five of his own gyms , a store in @entity42 's @entity41 , several fitness retreats and a collection of supplements			1
@entity2 has helped both @entity18 and his wife , @entity19 , to get into shape the lower prices are reflective of @entity2 's objective behind the launch - to make fitness available to all - as he said he is tired of hearing people 's excuses on why they do n't exercise			1
whether that 's being too poor , too busy or just too lazy			2
he told the @entity54 that you have no one to blame but yourself if you are unhappy with your fitness			1
' well if you do n't exercise congratulations on losing seven years of your life			2
there is n't a choice and there are no excuses			2
you are decreasing the quality of your life			2
' you need to make time			0
it takes 15 to 20 minutes of vigorous work , three to four days a week			0
' for @entity2 no excuses mean no excuses , as he even claims that new mothers should make time to exercise			1
other clients of @entity2 have included comedian @entity74 ' exercise whenever and wherever you can - for short bursts of time - is fantastic for your metabolism			1
many of my clients are busy mums and they only have 15 minutes to spare , which is enough to get results , ' says @entity2 , who famously got @entity84 back into shape after the birth of her daughter , @entity89			1
he says that exercising can easily be incorporated into any daily routine ; you just have to be inventive			0
' briskly pushing a pram , doing a ten to 15 - minute set of lunges , squats and tricep dips while you 're running a bath , or a short , fast sprint on a spin bike will get results , so do n't think you have to spend hours exercising to lose weight			0
' for @entity2 the body young girls should be aspiring towards is @entity103 his new gym range includes everything from the classic dumbbell to a very swish treadmill with bluetooth			1
however , @entity2 is insistent that the simplest of equipment - like a skipping rope - can be all it takes to get to start getting fit			1
@entity2 may have trained some rather impressive @entity114 stars but when it comes to a fitness role model , he believes @entity117 winner @entity103 makes a great idol for young women			1
' she ’s a great advert for females , ' he told the @entity54			0
' she ’s not your traditional , pencil - thin @entity123 actress			0
she 's got curves but she 's not overweight			0
she 's in great shape			0
' he added that we should n't be deterred by celebrities and that their body shapes are n't unattainable			0
' all bodies are just bodies			0
they all go through the same process			0
what makes someone a celebrity is not just the body , it 's the person			0
you can achieve the same as they can			0
you have to focus on what you can become , what you want to become and take great pride in that			0
' @entity145 , @entity146 , said : ' the products are a great addition and a natural evolution of the range given the success we have seen			1
introducing technology into the products also feeds customers desire for data and a more interactive user experience			2
' it ’s fantastic , on the treadmill one day you could be running around the streets of @entity161 and the next running around the @entity163 in @entity164			0
education is important and @entity2 's been fantastic to work with throughout landing the project and is really helping to aid the customers into how they can get the best out of their equipment			1
