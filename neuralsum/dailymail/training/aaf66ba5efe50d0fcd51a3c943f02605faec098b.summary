by @entity0 @entity1 after she joined @entity2 in @entity3 when i was in my late twenties and living in @entity7 , @entity3 , i had a job offer that ended up changing my life in more ways than one			1
i 'd moved to @entity3 in 1985 after meeting and marrying the politician @entity12			1
i began working in @entity13 but then , when my marriage disintegrated , i started work as a reporter with ethnic tv channel @entity17			2
i 'd wanted to be a journalist for years while i was an air hostess in the @entity19 , so i 'd already taken short courses and done some voluntary work at radio stations			0
my job at @entity17 , my first in television , really suited me and i very much enjoyed working in such a creative environment			0
so much so that after a year there i applied to be a reporter on a show called the 7.30 report on @entity2 , a much bigger tv station with a huge national audience			2
i had an interview , and then a few days later i was asked to meet the @entity33 @entity32			0
' great , ' i thought , ' i must be close to getting the job			0
' to my surprise , after a short chat with @entity32 he announced i was going to be @entity3 's first black tv presenter ! i was shocked			1
i 'd gone for a reporter 's job , and now this ! but @entity3 in the 1980s was n't as racially tolerant as it is now , so when the news got out it stirred up a huge media storm			1
everyone had an opinion as to why a @entity47 black female was on @entity3 tv			1
surely if a person of colour was going to be on television it should be someone from the indigenous @entity54 population ? i was living with my new fianc√© , tv producer @entity55 , at the time and i remember having to lie on @entity1 as a guest on @entity58 the back seat of the car as he drove me to the gym so journalists would n't spot me ! but even though i loved my job and put 110 per cent into it , it did n't stop the sniping			1
in fact , the negative press only died down when @entity70 wrote an article in a @entity73 newspaper accusing the @entity3 of being intolerant , which was picked up worldwide			2
i worked on the 7.30 report for a couple of years before setting up my own production company to make a chat show called @entity78 , which was then noticed by @entity79 in @entity73			0
they were looking to replace @entity81 when she left her talk show , and they offered me my own show			0
even though i was living in @entity3 , had two young girls and was about to marry my third husband , i leapt at the chance to get into tv in @entity73 , so i moved back to the @entity73 and @entity1 took off			1
now i 'm doing my show in @entity90 , the @entity91 , and i think that huge media storm helped toughen me up for the future , while the job at @entity2 set my career in motion			2
i 'm so glad it 's still continuing - 26 years in the business is a huge achievement			0
i 've fulfilled most of my ambitions now , but i 'd still like to direct a movie			0
you never know what 's around the corner			0
the @entity91 will air here on @entity106 next month			1
@entity1 is patron of the @entity108 family charity ; www.homestartnorwich.org .			2

@entity1 found fame when she became @entity3 's first black tv presenter
