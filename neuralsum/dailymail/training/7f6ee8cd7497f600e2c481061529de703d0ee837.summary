by @entity0 the age of the ‘ selfie ’ is well and truly upon us , but until now taking your own photo has required you to , well , take your own photo			2
@entity8 , the ‘ @entity13 ’ mirror that takes your picture when you smile at it			1
they devised the mirror as a fun and easy way to take selfies without the signature arm 's length - style shot			1
and they say the mirror could be used in a variety of environments , from businesses to bars			1
‘ we had to experiment with the platform a little bit to get it working , ’ @entity23 chief marketing officer @entity38 tells @entity39			1
‘ we had some funny things like it would locate a smile on the side of your head , so we played around until we were comfortable			2
behind the mirror is a @entity52 mini computer this powers a piece of freely available facial recognition software called @entity56			1
a webcam then looks outwards through the two - way mirror			1
when you smile , leds controlled by @entity60 light up vertically on the mirror			2
after two seconds the @entity59 ‘ flash ’ white and it snaps your photo the mirror then creates a tweet with the image for you			1
several people can also get in the shot , although it ca n’t recreate a photo with as many as people as the famous @entity76 selfie just yet			2
‘ we also considered photos being triggered by a wink , but we went with a smile as it fit with the narrative a bit more for a smiling selfie			0
’ at the moment the company does n’t have plans to make it commercially available , although they are considering supplying it to businesses			0
but they say the ' really awesome potential ' would be to mass produce it for hundreds of users			0
‘ it could absolutely also be deployed in bars and things , ’ @entity38 continues			0
‘ the core experience is not that different from a photobooth really			0
‘ what makes this special is all you see as a user is the mirror itself			0
‘ the hands - free selfie is a tagline we ’re playing around with			0
‘ you literally just stare into it and smile			0
’ @entity13 looks just like a normal mirror ( left ) until you approach it and smile ( right ) for two seconds , causing leds to light up and putting the technology at work to capture your picture behind the mirror a @entity52 mini , webcam and facial recognition software are at work to capture your photo			1
