a mother is claiming she was duped under false pretenses into giving up her child for adoption to the son of the former mayor of @entity6 and now wants her baby back			1
@entity8 says she gave up her son , @entity9 , to @entity10 and his wife @entity11 in september , but before the adoption was finalized she discovered the couple were getting a divorce			1
the couple have since split to live in @entity16 and @entity6 while @entity9 is now living with former mayor @entity17 - a situation which @entity8 calls a ' failed adoption '			1
scroll down for @entity20 teary : @entity8 wants her son @entity9 back from @entity10 and @entity22 because they divorced and did not tell her their marriage was in trouble during the adoption process @entity8 , who is already the mother of three , decided to give up her unborn son because she could not financially support him			1
she told @entity29 that she remembers thinking , ' how am i going to give this child everything i can ? ' a meeting with an adoption attorney led to the recommendation of @entity10 and @entity36 , who then both lived in @entity16			2
@entity8 said , ' they seemed like the perfect couple ' , and they were both present for @entity9 's birth			2
custody battle : @entity10 and @entity22 ( left ) do not currently have custody of @entity9 ( right ) despite taking him from @entity8 in september first christmas : the @entity45 with @entity9 before they separated and moved apart to @entity16 and @entity6 however , before the final paperwork went through , @entity8 discovered they were to split and she filed her emergency custody application because she believes the couple misrepresented themselves			1
' that ’s my baby			0
i love him , ' @entity8 said			0
' i ’m trying to do what ’s best for him , and even though i may have made a mistake placing him for adoption , i feel like @entity59 ’s giving me a chance now to fix that and to be there for him			0
' however , an adoption expert in @entity6 told @entity29 that the process @entity8 would have gone through would have been very specific			2
determined mother : @entity8 already has three children - and felt she could n't financially support a third so gave @entity9 up for adoption happy : the @entity69 's were there at @entity9 's birth and took him home to @entity16 afterwards ' the judge asks , ' you understand that forever is a long time ? ' said @entity75 , ' the mothers say , ' yes , i do			1
' he added that it would be up to @entity8 to prove fraud had taken place - which he said would be very difficult			0
in addition , the fact that they had legally declared their custody originally to not be in the ' best interests ' of the child would hinder any future claims			0
' and so the question gets to be , if you do n’t like this couple , it ’s not a matter of you getting the child back			0
it ’s finding another couple , ' @entity75 said			0
@entity8 said , ' i do n’t feel like i can give my son to anybody and trust anybody with him anymore			0
