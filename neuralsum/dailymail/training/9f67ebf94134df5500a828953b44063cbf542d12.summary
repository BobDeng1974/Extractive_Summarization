by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor energy companies have admitted giving dire service and baffling customers with confusing bills designed to hide the true cost of heating and lighting out homes			1
energy bosses say customers have been ‘ taken for granted ’ and treated badly , with charges that were ‘ never transparent ’			1
the astonishing admissions , delivered anonymously to pollsters for a new report this week , sparked warnings from @entity15 that increased competition to take on the @entity18 energy firms was needed to improve customer service			1
energy bosses say customers have been ' taken for granted ' and treated badly , with charges that were ' never transparent ' industry watchdog @entity22 last week announced it was referring the entire energy market to the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) for investigation			1
it found ‘ possible tacit co-ordination ’ on prices , with the @entity18 firms - @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 - apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time			0
specifically , there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them			0
now it has emerged that behind closed doors the bosses of some of the country ’s biggest energy suppliers acknowledge they have been treating their customers badly			1
they spoke to pollster @entity49 for a report to be published at a conference this week entitled @entity52			2
according to @entity54 , the remarks reveal a disregard for the customer and admit public anger at their treatment has fuelled @entity60 ’s radical plan to impose a two - year freeze if @entity62 wins the 2015 election			1
the combined annual profits from the @entity18 companies bosses from firms including @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 took part in the survey , along with senior figures from smaller companies			0
leading energy figures told @entity49 interviewers : ‘ customers were taken for granted , service was poor , and no one bothered to explain the situation to them ’ the report adds : ‘ the industry broadly accepts it helped to create the political opportunity that @entity60 seized			1
‘ as one would expect , there is moaning at politicians : practitioners believe that behind closed doors the politicians understand and even admit that a price freeze would be disruptive and unrealistic , and it ’s been mere opportunism to invent an ogre that they can then pretend to slay			2
’ but it adds : ‘ the industry also accepts that it has itself “ prepared the ground ” for what happened : billing was often confusing , never transparent , and complaints were handled badly			0
’ @entity15 said the problems could only be tackled if the power of the @entity18 was broken up through more competition in the market			0
@entity102 's official spokesman said : ' there is not enough competition in this area			0
competition is at the heart of the way we improve service across the board be it in terms of cost pressures , in the wider customer service , we want more competition			0
' the prime minister ' wants cost pressures coming down for all families , ' the spokesman added			0
soaring : this graph shows how average energy bills have risen over the past few years @entity122 , the executive director of which ? , said : ‘ it would be deeply worrying if energy industry leaders did n’t recognise the dire state of distrust they face			2
‘ our latest consumer survey shows satisfaction in this market has plummeted to a new low and only one in five consumers trusts suppliers to act in their best interest			0
that is why it is right to refer the energy market to a full - scale competition investigation — but suppliers should not wait to be forced into action and should start now to put customers first , keep costs as low as possible and trade transparently			1
’ static : fewer people switch energy suppliers after apparently giving up hope of getting a better deal @entity62 ’s shadow energy minister @entity150 said : ‘ these comments vindicate everything @entity62 has been saying for the last two years on the dysfunctional nature of the energy market			1
‘ it is unsurprising that people do n't trust the industry and wo n't until the market is clear fair and transparent			2
’ ‘ the only way to restore trust is to reset the energy market by freezing prices until 2017 and reforming the market to make it more transparent and competitive , as @entity62 has proposed			1
’ according to @entity49 opinion polls , energy firms are less trusted than bankers			0
more than two - thirds of people – 67 per cent – say the energy industry operates as a cartel while 51 per cent say rising bills has forced them to turn their heating down or off in the last year			2
the @entity172 said : ' the findings released last week by @entity22 and @entity24 ( @entity25 ) demonstrate the need to rebuild trust and confidence in the energy market			1
' @entity22 announced last week tough action based on a detailed , independent expert assessment of the state of competition in @entity183 ’s energy markets - leading to the first ever market reference for the energy markets			1
' this is just too important for people to rely on guesses about how to fix the energy markets			0
if we get it wrong , consumers will pay the price			0
' we will give @entity22 and the @entity25 whatever support they need to get this done as quickly as possible			0
' in the meantime , we ’ll keep working to help people pay less for the energy they use - continuing to drive the competition that has seen people switching supplier in record numbers , simpler tariffs and bills , getting energy companies to give back direct debit balances , taking £ 50 off the average bill and making switching faster and easier than it 's ever been			2
