@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has recovered from his summer ordeals to the extent there is now considerable support among top - flight teams for him to be promoted to executive chairman			1
the clubs ’ meeting on thursday appointed headhunters @entity11 to help find a successor to city financier @entity13 , who is too ill to continue in the role after suffering a stroke			0
but the talk before the summit was that as many as 10 clubs , including some of the bigger ones , might back @entity0 ’s role being upgraded			2
and 10 is not far short of the 14 - club majority needed for @entity1 changes			0
@entity1 chief @entity0 in the stands at @entity25 for @entity27 's game against @entity28 it represents a surprisingly rapid return for @entity0 to his old ‘ ringmaster ’ influence			2
the 55 - year - old nearly lost his job in the furore that followed his sexist text exchanges with @entity1 lawyer @entity37			0
then in june he had heart surgery , from which he has made a full recovery			0
the part - time job @entity42 2018 found for an acquaintance of @entity46 rogue @entity44 during the bidding process , which ethics judge @entity49 claims undermined the integrity of the bidding process , turned out to be a work experience position			2
there is no record the @entity56 even paid the young man for his eight - week stint			1
beleaguered @entity60 chairman @entity59 said before the @entity1 clubs meeting that the troubles at @entity60 would easily be remedied by a ‘ few wins ’			1
meanwhile , although @entity42 grandees such as @entity66 chairman sir @entity65 and @entity68 ’s @entity67 attend clubs meetings , not one foreign club owner was at thursday ’s @entity72 summit			1
@entity60 chairman @entity59 said that trouble at @entity60 would be remedied by ' a few wins ' @entity76 , the departing @entity56 general secretary , enjoyed an annual salary and bonuses of £ 528,000 , making him the highest paid boss of a sports governing body in the @entity81			1
but @entity56 chairman @entity82 has no intention of paying @entity76 ’s successor that amount			1
and there is opposition among @entity56 powerbrokers to any contract discussions with @entity90 before @entity91			2
they feel , after the @entity95 debacle , the manager should be judged on how @entity42 perform in @entity96 rather than on the easiest of qualifying tasks			2
@entity100 ’s @entity99 stitch - up @entity49 's report somehow regards @entity42 spending £ 35,000 on the 2010 @entity104 gala dinner at @entity44 ’s behest as being a bigger breach of @entity46 regulations than @entity100 forking out £ 1.15m to endorse the @entity108 ( @entity110 ) congress in @entity111 in 2010			1
and this despite @entity42 2018 having clearance from @entity46 to do so , while nothing was known about @entity100 ’s huge sponsorship until after the deal was done			1
there is no mention that @entity100 barred @entity42 from presenting to @entity110 delegates because they had bought exclusive rights to the event			1
the @entity111 summit was also the occasion on which @entity124 made it clear he was helping the @entity100 bid , although @entity49 claims the cash - for - votes scandal which led to his lifetime ban from football was only to do with his aborted bid for the @entity46 presidency			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
the world stops for @entity1 business , even with @entity46 in meltdown			0
it needed your ever helpful @entity137 columnist to inform @entity56 chairman @entity82 — when he emerged after three hours stuck in a clubs summit on thursday — about @entity141 ’s castigation of his @entity46 ethics colleague @entity49			1
@entity141 ( left ) and @entity49 shake hands outside @entity144 in 2012 sir @entity145 was asked at one of his autobiography book events why @entity148 did n’t get a mention and @entity145 intimated that @entity148 would n’t be pleased			0
however , on page one of the updated paperback edition , @entity145 writes : ‘ @entity148 has become a great pal			0
’ @entity44 's most ridiculous demands to the @entity42 2018 team were not included in @entity49 ’s flawed report , in which he gave the strong impression @entity42 kowtowed to @entity44 at every opportunity			0
certainly they rejected @entity44 ’s request that they pay $ 1m for @entity163 - torn @entity162 ’s @entity95 tv rights , which was to be paid into the @entity104 account			0
@entity42 were criticised for trying to woo former @entity46 vice-president @entity44			0
