by @entity1 reporter published : 04:06 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 20:23 est , 30 july 2013 arm heavily strapped in plaster , @entity2 looks as if she may have been in a particularly nasty accident			1
but these injuries were the result of an encounter with a tom cat in her bedroom			1
the library assistant suffered a dozen bite wounds when the animal attacked her as she tried to pull it away from a fight with her own cat			2
recovering : @entity2 spent six days at @entity18 recovering after a savage attack by a neighbour 's cat ms @entity2 was left with multiple bite wounds on her hand and wrist after she intervened to save her own cat gem			1
after a couple of days her wrist had swelled to twice the size , right after the incident she went to hospital for a tetanus jab but a short while later her hand swelled to twice its normal size and she had to be admitted for six days			1
her arm was put in plaster and she was given an intravenous antibiotic drip amid fears she would develop blood poisoning			0
@entity40 ’s ordeal began when she was woken just after midnight by the noise of her own cat gem being attacked in her bedroom by the ginger tom			1
the rival had climbed into the ground floor room through a top window she had left open because of the warm weather			0
she said : ‘ i ’d been in a really deep sleep and woke up by the sound of the cats fighting			2
i pulled @entity52 away and the other cat just went for my right hand and sank its teeth in			1
it bit down so hard i screamed and then it did it two or three more times on my hand			2
‘ i grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and pulled it off my hand and chucked it straight out of the window			2
there was blood all over the carpet and the curtains and i was in agony			0
’ ms @entity2 's cat , gem ( pictured ) , was attacked by an unknown neighbour 's cat in the middle of the night the ginger tom cat woke ms silver when it crept in her bedroom at night and started to fight with 15 - year - old gem , pictured @entity40 , of @entity18 , bathed her wounds in boiled salty water and drove to hospital as a precaution			1
doctors warned her cat bites could prove dangerous and told her to return in 48 hours			1
within that time @entity84 ’s hand had ballooned in size and she was in tremendous pain			1
doctors immediately admitted her to a ward			1
she was put on the antibiotic drip and her right arm was made immobile in a raised position in an attempt to minimise the risk of any infection spreading			2
@entity40 was told doctors might have to operate to clean the deep wounds thoroughly			2
she said : ‘ when they told me i needed to be admitted for surgery i was horrified			0
‘ i was supposed to be going away for the weekend two hours later – the hotel was booked and paid for			0
fortunately @entity52 escaped without too many injuries , but ms @entity2 faced possible surgery to clean out the infected wounds before and after : the wounds to @entity2 's hand after she was attacked by a stray cat , and after treatment for the infection that caused her hand and wrist to swell to twice the size ‘ they told me i could go home if i wanted to but said there was a risk of septicaemia which could prove fatal			1
in the circumstances i was n’t going to take any chances			0
’ @entity40 said she planned to distribute leaflets around her area warning neighbours about the cat			0
‘ he ’s the evil twin of my cat and he ’s attacked my neighbour ’s cat too and left her with a huge vets ’ bill			0
when i went home before being admitted to hospital it was there sat on my doorstep			1
‘ i ’ve no idea what he ’s called , or who owns it , but people need to be told about him			0
‘ i do n’t know whether he came in through my window looking for food or a fight but i would n’t like to meet him again			0
’ last year @entity143 , 80 , was left looking like a mugging victim after she was attacked by a neighbour ’s cat in @entity147			0
she suffered two black eyes and painful scratches when the pet clawed at her face as she tended her garden .			0
