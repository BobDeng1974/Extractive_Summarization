child protection services have again seized the two ' free range ' children of a mother and father whose unusual approach to parenting has become a national debate			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , both scientists in @entity9 , made headlines just before @entity13 when police found @entity15 , 10 and @entity16 , six , wandering the sidewalk on their own			1
on sunday , a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home			2
the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to @entity0			1
meanwhile , mrs @entity28 tells @entity29 that @entity0 workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe			1
picked up again : the @entity34 say they were left to panic for hours by @entity0 workers after their children -- who they raise with a so - called ' free - range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone taught a lesson ? the @entity34 say their kids @entity16 and @entity15 went missing starting around 6pm			1
they were not reunited with them until 10:30 what 's more , the elder child , @entity15 , insists the scariest part of the hours - long ordeal was being picked up by police			1
‘ they kept the kids for hours , ’ a shaken @entity28 told @entity29 5 after being reunited with them			2
‘ it ’s 10:30 at night			0
they ’ve been missing since 6 o’clock … somebody called 911 and the police called @entity0 and they decided to bring the kids here and they did n’t call us			1
’ according to mrs. @entity28 , the children were expected home no later than 6:30			0
when 6:30 came and went , they became frantic			0
they would not receive a call from @entity0 until 8pm			2
even then , they say they were n't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours			1
in the interim , @entity15 tells @entity29 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift			1
@entity15 said : ‘ the policeman said “ we ’ll give you a ride home ” when we were like two blocks away			2
and two and a half hours later , after sitting in the car two and a half hours , he said “ i ’ll bring you home ” and , instead , he brought us here			0
’ ' besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours - long ordeal sunday , 10 - year - old @entity15 admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister seized : officials seized six - year - old @entity16 ( left , far left ) and 10 - year - old @entity15 ( left , blue hat ) on sunday in a @entity9 park			1
their parents @entity10 and @entity11 are pictured , right , going to confront @entity0 officials free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '			1
' helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe			0
however critics believe this creates under - confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress			2
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own			1
instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves			0
' here ' was @entity0 , @entity15 said			1
and as he and his sister sat waiting to go home , their parents say ' upper management ' at @entity0 was involved in keeping that from happening			2
only at 10:30pm did mrs. @entity28 say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash			2
‘ they made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up , ' and i ’m not gon na risk my kids being snatched again like this by @entity0			1
' when questioned , the @entity34 say they believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy			1
in march , the @entity0 found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone			1
it meant the agency would start a file on the family 's activities and whereabouts for at least five years			0
the @entity34 hit back at the ruling , insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences			2
unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to such charges			0
it usually comes when the @entity0 has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action			1
parenting style : the @entity34 believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age this seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the @entity169 , who both work as scientists , furious			1
in march , @entity28 told the @entity173 they were planning to appeal the decision			0
' we do n’t feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start , much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect , ' she told the @entity173			0
' what will happen next time ? ' she said			0
' we do n’t know if we will get caught in this kafkaesque loop again			0
' on december 20 , police in @entity183 picked up @entity15 and @entity16 walking home on a saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it			1
the @entity188 told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well			2
the @entity0 sent the @entity34 a letter on february 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the @entity173 they would not be commenting on the process			1
outraged , @entity28 said she does not see why it is wrong to give her children independence			2
' we 're just doing what our parents did			0
it was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago , ' she said on today in january			0
guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the @entity34 make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street defiant : @entity10 and @entity11 have said that they will continue to bring up their children as they see fit @entity28 admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before , but says she was n't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues			1
' well i 've walked home from school before			0
not with my sister , but i 've done it alone , ' 10 - year - old @entity15 said			2
' we walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block			0
the @entity34 describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world			1
both parents are highly educated			0
@entity11 is a @entity236 at @entity237 and @entity10 is an oceanographer			1
usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads ' i 'm not lost			0
i 'm a free range kid ' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house			1
asked what the @entity0 would do the next time they are called , they said they would simply follow procedure			0
what 's wrong ? @entity28 ( right ) appeared on the today show in january with her 10 - year - old son @entity15 ( center ) and 6 - year - old daughter @entity16 about a month after @entity0 launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone parenting choice : mrs @entity28 ( pictured ) says she and husband @entity11 often let their children @entity15 , 10 , and @entity16 , 6 , walk alone to teach them about the world ' if we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen , we are required to investigate			1
our goal is the safety of children , always , ' said @entity275 , spokeswoman for the @entity9 @entity276 to the @entity173			2
the free range parenting trend was first popularized in 2008 by @entity279 journalist @entity278 , in a piece entitled why i let my 9 - year - @entity282			1
she was railing against helicopter parenting and speaking to the @entity173 said that she was appalled by the ruling against the @entity34			2
' the go - to narrative in the last 20 or 30 years for parents was , " take your eyes off your kid for even a second and he ’ll be snatched			0
" what the @entity28 case did was pivot the story to : " give your kid one second of freedom and the government will arrest you			0
" ’ speaking about her horror at the decision , @entity28 said she turned to her husband and felt humiliated			0
' i was kind of horrified , ' she said			0
' you try as a parent to do what ’s right			0
even though i know they are wrong , it ’s a painful judgment			0
' journey : on december 20 , the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents			0

police seized @entity15 , 10 , and @entity16 , 6 , in a @entity9 park on sunday and their parents say they were n't reunited by @entity0 for hours
scientists @entity10 and @entity11 believe in ' free range parenting ' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy
