by @entity0 some robots can mimic human expressions , while others walk like man			2
but in order to help humans better understand the intention of robots , one team is working on a droid that sweats when it is nervous			1
another prototype robot gets goosebumps when there is a cold breeze or it is told a scary story			1
a team of roboticists is working on a droid that sweats when it is nervous and another prototype that gets goosebumps when it is cold or scared			1
a stock image of a robot displaying ' emotion ' is pictured a group of roboticists led by @entity27 at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , are creating the machines which show physiological reactions , @entity25 reported			1
their third prototype is a teddy bear called @entity35 that uses a fan to make breath when it is talking			1
more air is produced when the bear is speaking loudly than quietly – so when it whispers it seems more ‘ realistic ’			1
the idea behind the machines is that by giving robots involuntary reactions , humans can have a better idea of their intentions			1
scientists think that if they look visibly anxious or frightened by showing easily - recognisable signs , we are more likely to accept and feel at ease with them			1
@entity54 might create machines that show their intentions , but a math model says emotional machines like @entity59 the android from @entity60 's @entity61 ( pictured ) wo n't exist one of the prototype droids can show it is under pressure or anxious by sweating from its forehead , rather than stating its ‘ emotions , ’ which researchers from @entity69 described as ‘ awkward ’			1
but no information has been revealed so far about just how it does this			0
@entity74 robot expert @entity73 explained in a recent @entity76 talk that not being able to have an idea of a robot ’s intentions makes humans nervous			2
‘ when someone hands an object to you , you can read intention in their eyes , their face , their body language			2
that 's not true of the robot , ’ he said			0
dr @entity27 said that while humans sometimes make facial expressions that disguise what they are really thinking , involuntary responses such as sweating and shivering reveal their ‘ true feelings ’ and the same could be true of robots in the future			1
while robots are being developed that can hint at genuine reactions , one mathematician from the @entity103 in @entity104 has said that robots will ‘ never ’ have real feelings			2
@entity107 said that computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling			0
a mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness suggests that emotional machines will never exist			2
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			0
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity124 at the @entity125 , says that the ability to integrate information is a key feature of consciousness			0
he believes that integrated information ca n't be broken down into smaller components in conscious minds , because the brain contextualises information			0
@entity107 of the @entity103 in @entity104 , used mathematics to show that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			0
therefore , if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			0
professor @entity107 says that consciousness can not be created in a physical machine in finite time using limited memory			0
‘ it does n't necessarily mean that there is some magic going on in the brain that involves some forces that ca n't be explained physically			0
it is just so complex that it 's beyond our abilities to reverse it and decompose it , ’ he said .			0

roboticists at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 have created three prototype robots that show physiological reactions
one droid sweats from its forehead to show it is ' anxious ' while another gets goosebumps in a cold breeze or when it is read a scary story
a bear uses a fan to create ' breath ' according to how loud it speaks , to make it seem more realistic to humans
scientists think extra ' emotional ' clues will help humans be more *comfortable* with droids
