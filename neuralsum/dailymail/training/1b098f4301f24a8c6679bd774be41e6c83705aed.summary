with every pivotal moment in human history , it seems a conspiracy theory is not far behind			2
when men first landed on the moon , people soon claimed that the achievement had in fact been faked in a studio in @entity10			0
and when @entity12 landed its curiosity rover on @entity14 , some were adamant the agency had fooled us all by filming it in @entity18			0
and now , after @entity21 completed humanity 's first ever landing on a comet , so - called @entity20 experts have claimed @entity24 is not a comet at all - but in fact a spaceship			1
they said comet @entity24 ( pictured ) is actually an alien spaceship sending signals			1
and they claim @entity21 sent the @entity38 spacecraft there to make contact			1
the bizarre claims were apparently exposed by an anonymous @entity21 ' whistle blower ' one of the most bizarre claims was made by @entity43 of the website @entity45			1
he said he had received an email from an anonymous @entity21 ' whistle blower ' that claimed intelligent - sounding signals had been received from comet @entity50 20 years ago and the object is actually an alien ship in disguise			1
the email said : ' do not think for one moment that a space agency would suddenly decide to spend billions of dollars to build and send a spacecraft on a 12 - year journey to simply take some close - up images of a randomly - picked - out comet floating in space			1
' @entity24 is not a comet			1
' comets are of great interest to scientists because they are the oldest and most primitive bodies in the solar system that we know of			0
they preserve the earliest record of material from the nebula from which our sun and planets formed			0
while the planets in the solar system have gone through chemical transformations , comets have remained almost unchanged in the 4.5 billion year history of the solar system			0
it is also thought that they brought certain elements to planets , including water			0
they also carry complex organic molecules that may triggered life on @entity88			0
the whistle blower , who insisted on remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals , insisted the comet ' is only being disguised as such ' and appears able to change trajectory at will			1
the letter added : ' as for who is disguising it and why i can not answer ; all i can tell you is that whatever this thing is , it does show signs on its outside of machine - like parts and unnatural terrain			0
' whatever this object is it did not ask to be found or scrutinised , and it appears for good reason			0
' other theorists spoke of ' alien structures ' in images of the comet , in particular a bright white ' metallic ' disc on or hovering above the 2.5 mile ( 4km ) wide lump of ice and dust , and a sculpted non-human face			2
@entity21 unwittingly sent the speculation into overdrive when it disclosed that the comet was ' singing '			1
clicking oscillations in the object 's magnetic field , below the range of human hearing , sounded strangely tuneful			2
yesterday , @entity21 's @entity126 lander completed its landing on a comet and returned this image , which is the first ever picture from the surface of a comet			1
the historic moment has been heralded as one of humanity 's greatest achievements in space exploration			1
another post from ' ex-naval electronics warfare technician ' @entity139 on the website @entity141 said : ' definitely not a natural signal , there is intelligent based stuff going on here			0
' on the same site , @entity145 commented : ' this signal is very much a non-natural source			0
the irony of @entity38 being sent there is too strong a coincidence			2
' another post on @entity45 argued that the signal ' had to have been made for humanity '			2
it added : ' is it a message of greetings ? or is it a warning of what 's to come ? we the people of the world need to find out			0
' of course , the comet is n't really ' singing '			0
it is emitting a natural signal at 40 - 50 millihertz that , when amplified a few thousand times , sounds like a familiar sound			0
the music was heard clearly by the magnetometer experiment for the first time in august , when @entity38 drew to within 60 miles ( 100 km ) of the comet			1
scientists think it must be produced by the activity of the comet , as it releases neutral particles into space where they become electrically charged due to a process called ionisation			2
@entity20 expert @entity182 , author of @entity183 , told @entity184 : ' the stories and rumours surrounding @entity187 reflect the growing belief that aliens from outer space have , since the distant past , been making regular visits to our neck of the galaxy			1
' the obsession with turning any unusual rock photographed on @entity14 into an animal or artefact , and viewing any speck of light or object captured by spacecraft cameras as alien spaceships is part of our need to believe that we are not alone			2
' these activities also indicate that many ufologists have virtually given up on actually investigating @entity20 sightings made on @entity88 , and indicates their frustration with being unable to find solid evidence to prove that ufos are alien craft			1

@entity20 believers claim @entity31 's comet mission had a hidden task
they said comet @entity24 is actually an alien spaceship that is sending signals
and they claim @entity21 sent the @entity38 spacecraft there to make contact
bizarre claims were apparently exposed by an anonymous ' whistle blower '
yesterday , @entity21 's @entity126 lander completed the first ever landing on a comet
the historic moment has been heralded as one of humanity 's greatest achievements in space exploration
