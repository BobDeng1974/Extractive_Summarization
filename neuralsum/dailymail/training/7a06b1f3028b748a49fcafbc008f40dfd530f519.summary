cybersecurity experts have given a detailed outline to the @entity2 about the hack attack against @entity4 , insisting it was not the work of @entity7 but a group of current and former employees who shared a ' mutual hatred ' for the company			1
while the @entity2 and @entity4 have announced they believe @entity13 carried out the hack - claims that were denied by leader @entity16 - independent security officials have been coming forward for the past week saying most of the evidence points to an inside job			1
@entity20 security firm @entity19 , which provides intelligence to companies to prevent their software from being hacked , has been investigating the compromise at @entity4 and shared their findings with the @entity2 on tuesday , according to @entity26			1
norse senior vice president @entity27 said the hack hinges on a woman he called ' @entity30 ' , who he says worked in a ' key technical ' position for 10 years but was sent packing in may during a large sweep of lay - offs			1
however he said @entity30 would have remained ' very well placed to know which servers to target ' after leaving the company and ' where all the sensitive information in @entity4 was stored '			2
@entity30 - which may be an alias - then joined forces with other former employees and people in the hacking community to humiliate @entity4			1
@entity27 said the people who had n't worked for @entity4 ' were individuals that were connected with torrenting @entity4 movies and content online , were targeted by legal and law enforcement arms , and were irritated that basically they were caught '			2
' we are very confident that this was not an attack master - minded by @entity7 and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history , ' @entity27 told @entity61 last week			2
however , consulting firm @entity62 said the results of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected hackers suggest they were more likely from @entity67 than @entity7			2
' i think the government acted prematurely in announcing unequivocally that it was @entity7 before the investigation was complete , ' said @entity71 , a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor			0
an investigation by cybersecurity firm norse has found that it is likely a @entity4 insider might have helped launch the attack , and that @entity7 is not responsible the @entity2 maintains that the @entity4 hack was carried out by @entity13 over the release of @entity79 , which depicts the assassination of @entity16 ' there are many theories about who did it and how they did it			1
the government has to be pursuing all of them			0
' while @entity89 officials investigate whether @entity7 enlisted help from outside contractors , the @entity2 stood by its previous statement that @entity13 was the prime author of the attack against the @entity4 unit			1
' the @entity2 has concluded the @entity96 is responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network of @entity4 , ' the @entity2 said in a statement to @entity102			1
@entity7 has denied that it was behind the @entity4 attack and has vowed to hit back against any @entity89 retaliation			1
the people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said on @entity109 postings that they were incensed by the @entity4 film ' @entity79 , ' a comedy about a fictional assassination of @entity7 leader @entity16			1
because of the hackers ' threats , major @entity89 cinema chains refused to show the film			0
last week , @entity4 struck deals with some 320 independent theaters to distribute ' @entity79 ' and also made the film available online			0
the hackers released the email caches of @entity4 executives , including co-chairman of @entity4 @entity123 and its ceo @entity124 the @entity2 said its determination that @entity7 was behind the hack was based on information from a variety of sources , including intelligence sources , the @entity89 @entity131 , foreign partners and the private sector			1
' there is no credible information to indicate that any other individual is responsible for this cyber incident , ' the agency said			0
@entity139 , whose security firm was hired by @entity4 to investigate the attack , said the only way to know who the culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected machines back to the hackers ' machines			2
only the government and internet service providers have that kind of visibility , he added			0
' i do n't have the data that they have to come up with that conclusion , ' @entity139 , chief operating officer of @entity153 , said			0
' every attack loops through numerous machines , ' he said			0
' you have to peel that onion all the way back			0
it is n't an easy thing to do			0
' @entity139 , who has supervised investigations into some of the world 's biggest cyberattacks , said the @entity4 case was unprecedented			0
' nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely destroy all your data , or try to anyway , and that 's just something that no one else has seen , ' he said .			0

cybersecurity experts think @entity4 hack was inside job
@entity20 firm @entity19 says it was a group of former employees paid off in may and people from the hacking community who hated @entity4
one woman *involved* , who the firm called @entity30 , worked there for a decade
@entity2 still maintains @entity7 was responsible for attack
@entity2 is investigating *possibility* that @entity7 hired foreign help
