disgraced ex-navy seal @entity0 - who wrote a first hand account of the mission to kill @entity5 - allegedly ' recruited ' other fellow @entity6 to provide classified information to the makers of popular video game ' @entity11 : warfighter '			1
senior @entity13 officials confirmed today that seven members of the secretive @entity15 , of which @entity16 was a member , have been disciplined for providing classified information to @entity18			1
spending two days as paid consultants for the game - makers , the @entity6 were punished for the latest embarrassing leak involving the elite special forces unit with letters of reprimand and forfeited their pay for two months but will not face jail time			1
four other seals , all based on the @entity29 , are also under investigation for similar alleged violations , one other official said			2
' as they were looking into his book deal , the money , whether he violated the non-disclosure agreements he signed ... what they ended up learning is that 11 @entity6 had been brought in allegedly by @entity47 into this deal with a video company for the production of @entity11 : warfighter , a @entity6 - based video game , ' said @entity65 senior correspondent and former assistant director of national intelligence @entity66			1
this issue raised the same concerns as @entity16 's book			0
' there was no notification of their commanding officer , no waivers signed ... none of the boxes had been checked			0
' one serious point for @entity79 defense chief 's is the possibility that classified information - known as ' @entity81 ' or @entity82 - can be picked up by @entity84 pirates or indeed terrorists just by playing what should be a simple video game			1
' what do the warfighters do , what tricks do they use , how do they work ? ' said @entity66			0
' i guess if you stretch it there you could say that if you played that video game enough based on real @entity6 knowledge , you could learn to counter some of those @entity97			1
' the worry for @entity100 chiefs is if the 11 seals in total divulged information on equipment and tactics that could be used against the elite fighting force the popular video game boasts that was ' written by actual @entity79 @entity109 while deployed overseas			1
' in fact , according to @entity66 , the good publicity that came from the succesful @entity5 raid is now backfiring on the elite and secretive unit			1
' the special operations community looks on this as too much of a good thing , ' said @entity66			0
' they have run into the @entity120 generation - they are used to living out loud , used to talking as individuals			0
they are used to it being all about me and that 's a conflict			0
' each of the seven received a punitive letter of reprimand - which generally prevents individuals from being promoted - and a partial forfeiture of pay for two months			0
the deputy commander of @entity135 , rear admiral @entity136 , issued a statement acknowledging that nonjudicial punishments had been handed out for misconduct , but he did not offer any details			0
' we do not tolerate deviations from the policies that govern who we are and what we do as sailors in the @entity13 , ' @entity136 said			0
he alluded to the importance of honoring nondisclosure agreements that @entity6 sign			2
he said the punishments this week ' send a clear message throughout our force that we are and will be held to a high standard of accountability			0
' @entity6 ( pictured ) have entered into the public consciousness since the legendary @entity15 conducted their successful raid on @entity5 in @entity157 in may of 2011 secrets : one of the scenarios in the game is based on a real battle with @entity84 pirates the two main complaints against the @entity6 were that they did not seek the permission of their command to take part in the video game project and that they showed the video designers some of their specially designed combat equipment unique to their unit , said a senior military official			1
the official was briefed about the case but was not authorized to speak publicly about it			0
in the actual game promotional materials @entity18 claimed that it was ' written by actual @entity79 @entity109 while deployed overseas			0
' it adds that give ' players a view into globally recognised threats ... letting them experience the action as it might have unfolded			0
' tier 1 operator is a military term for units involved in the most sensitive and classified operations			2
while @entity100 officials refused to discuss the exact nature of the information the @entity6 allegedly gave away , the leak is just the latest in a series since the may 2nd 2011 @entity5 raid			1
last year the @entity193 itself was involved when the administration was accused of improperly disclosing details of the mission to the @entity198 for political gain			2
worrying : several @entity6 have been pulled off active duty to deal with the fallout from the controversial book about the killing of @entity5 and then infamously , this fall , @entity100 officials began an investigation after the publication of ' @entity0 ' which is a first person account of the @entity5 raid by former @entity15 member , @entity0			1
@entity0 , who participated in the raid in @entity210 , @entity157 , but later retired from the @entity6 , published his book under the pseudonym @entity47 , but he landed in hot water with the @entity100 even before it was published in september			1
the @entity100 accused him of disclosing classified information in violation of the nondisclosure agreements he had signed as a seal			1
@entity0 - @entity221 member who used the pseudonym @entity47 to write no @entity0 watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity5 's compound , the @entity223 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity229 tension : the raid of @entity5 's @entity210 compound was watched by president @entity229 and his closest advisers in the @entity234 of the @entity193 while they have not taken any formal action against him , the @entity100 have said they are looking at their legal options			1
the @entity218 mission to capture or kill @entity5 , while stunningly successful , encountered a number of unexpected obstacles , including the loss of a stealthy helicopter that was partially blown up by the seals after making a hard landing inside @entity5 's compound			2
the head of @entity135 , rear admiral @entity247 , responded to the @entity16 book by telling his force that ' hawking details about a mission ' and selling other information about seal training and operations puts the force and their families at risk			2
seals , both active duty and retired , possess highly sensitive information about tactics and techniques that are central to the success of their secret and often dangerous missions overseas			0
that is why they are obliged to sign nondisclosure agreements when they enter service and when they leave , and it is why the @entity100 seeks to enforce such written agreements			0
the punishments were first reported by @entity43			2

seven members of @entity15 have been disciplined for providing classified information to the makers of hit video game @entity11
@entity43 is reporting that @entity0 - who published a first hand account of the may 2011 @entity5 raid - helped organise the @entity6 consultation
is the latest in a series of alleged leaks surrounding the @entity5 mission and the @entity6 involved
