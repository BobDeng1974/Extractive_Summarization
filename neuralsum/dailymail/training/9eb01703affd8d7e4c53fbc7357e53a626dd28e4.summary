by @entity1 reporter published : 19:16 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 11:10 est , 3 june 2013 the prestigious @entity4 ’s first black soloist in twenty years will take the stage this week , but that ’s only the tip of the iceberg in the unlikely , groundbreaking life of ballerina @entity10			1
the 30 - year - old beauty hits the stage in ' @entity13 ' at the @entity14 tuesday , but her star turn is just one of a string of firsts and a fascinating life story she brings along with her			1
for starters , @entity20 , a native of @entity21 , @entity22 , grew up in extreme poverty			2
she did n’t even know what ballet was when she was spotted by an instructor at her local @entity28 at 13			1
‘ i had no introduction to the arts in any way definitely not the fine arts , ’ @entity20 told the @entity38 of her childhood , part of which was spent living out of a motel room with her mother			2
‘ survival was our @entity50 priority , not extracurriculars , or a career , ’ she said			2
‘ these were not things we thought about			2
’ she was destined , however , to think a lot about those things			2
in fact , she would soon be thinking of nothing but			2
formerly known as : @entity20 dances with @entity60 at @entity61 in 2010 as part of the musician 's tour			1
the pop legend reportedly asked her personally to appear with him racy : @entity20 danced atop @entity60 's piano as part of one of his signature sexy performances , this one in his 2010 - 2011 ' welcome 2 @entity74 ' tour a ballet instructor named @entity76 spotted @entity20 ’s potential and told her she was ‘ you are the most gifted dancer i ’ve ever seen , and this could be a path to have a career			1
’ and that ’s what it became			0
but at 13 , @entity20 was at a major disadvantage			0
whereas most ballerinas start at the age of 5 , with money and eager parents backing them			0
@entity20 was not so lucky			0
in just a few years , the young phenom had to cram in nearly two decades worth of training			0
that is , if she wanted to compete among the best			0
in addition to her age and the color of her skin , @entity20 stood apart from her peers as she quickly rose in the ranks of the world ’s best dancers because of her physique			1
where most ballerinas are extremely slim , @entity20 is curvaceous			0
almost lost it : the stunning dancer will star in ' @entity13 ' just 8 months after undergoing surgery to correct a potentially career - ending bone fracture @entity20 ’s rise to prominence , at least at first , also caused some problems with her family			1
@entity76 invited @entity20 to live with her in order to allow her maintain the kind of focus most ballerinas - in - training have , away from her impoverished home life			0
but after a few years of this , life away from her daughter took a toll on @entity20 ’s mother and a bitter battle ensued for custody of the then 15 - year - old			0
@entity20 ’s mother eventually won out			0
‘ my mom said , “ i want you to be a normal child , living at home , going to school , ” ’ @entity20 recalled			0
nonetheless , @entity20 's life was destined not to be normal			1
she continued to pursue her ballet dreams , winning awards , accolades , her own 2013 calendar , and even the adoration of pop legend @entity60			2
model citizen : @entity10 's unlikely rise to ballet stardom has recently won her something usually reserved for swimsuit models : her own wall calendar in 2010 , after @entity144 personally pursued her , @entity20 agreed to dance as part of @entity60 's string of @entity148 performances			1
@entity20 gushed about the experience to the @entity38 : ' the energy i felt at @entity61 was like nothing i 've ever experienced			0
i felt such a connection with the audience because you can hear their feedback , which does n't happen during classical ballet performances			2
' she says they 've stayed in touch since and @entity60 even attends her performances at the @entity4 , where she gets him box seats			1
and perhaps he 'll be there this tuesday , when @entity20 breaks boundaries with her lead role in ‘ @entity13			1
’ this , just a few months after a severe fracture and the subsequent surgery to correct nearly ended her extraordinary career			0
leader : as her star shines in the ballet world , @entity20 , a who was raised in poverty in @entity21 , @entity22 , wants to show @entity181 youth they , too , can succeed in ballet now , in the midst of her great success , @entity20 wants to position herself as a role model for dancers of color			1
‘ people say , “ it ’s 2013 , you live in @entity148 , you ’re [ being ] dramatic , ” but they do n’t understand the way the ballet world works , ” she told the @entity38			1
‘ we ’re completely behind the way the world has evolved			2
@entity195 is just kind of staid			0
’ and she wants to help change that			0
‘ for young african - americans to feel that they have a chance to see a brown face on the stage , that ballet is n’t this white world that ’s untouchable to them , ’ she said			1
‘ i think having that visual does so much			0
i think it ’s so important for them to see me and to hear me			0
’ @entity20 's turn in the comedic ballet ' @entity207 ' runs june 4 - 8 at @entity148 's @entity14			1
@entity208 turn : @entity20 stars in ' @entity13 , ' a pirate - themed comedic ballet , at @entity148 's @entity14 june 4 - 8			1

@entity213 wants to use her *notoriety* to show black youths they too can break into the elite ballet world
she stars in the @entity4 's ' @entity13 ' starting june 4 in @entity148
