’ shadow defence secretary @entity57 said that , despite @entity10 ’s demand for more ‘ evidence , he had ‘ no doubt ’ that tyrant @entity61 had used chemical weapons and would use them again			1

’ but the shadow foreign secretary @entity92 suggested @entity10 would hold mr @entity66 to his word on @entity3 , regardless of developments in the country ’s bloody civil war			1

‘ if he was now to return to the @entity108 and say well actually because the @entity109 has decided to go to the @entity110 , i ’ve changed my mind about what @entity91 was saying and what the @entity101 people were saying , i think that would weigh very heavily on the ability for him to convince the public or @entity91 that his judgement was sound			0
’ mr @entity1 insisted @entity10 ’s actions had not damaged the ‘ special relationship ’ with the @entity121			2

’ former foreign office minister @entity97 , one of the few @entity132 not to vote against the government , said mr @entity1 had to take his share of the blame for the fact @entity101 now looks highly unlikely to back punitive action against @entity61 over his use of chemical weapons			0
