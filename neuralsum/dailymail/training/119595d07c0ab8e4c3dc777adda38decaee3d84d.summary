by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 13:52 est , 7 july 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 8 july 2013 @entity3 today tried to laugh off complaints about his decision to unfurl a @entity7 saltire in @entity8 , insisting @entity10 rules were there to be broken			1
the @entity7 first minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife 's handbag before waving around behind @entity19 's head as @entity20 secured his historic win			1
he insisted no - one sticks to the rule banning large flags around @entity8 , and after waiting 117 years for a @entity24 to win the men 's singles ' a few @entity6 hoisted over @entity10 does n’t really harm at all '			1
pr stunt ? @entity7 first minister @entity3 waving a giant @entity7 flag , breaking @entity10 spectator rules what have you got there ? the first minister looks set to unfurl his giant @entity6 as @entity19 glances behind to see what 's going on the stunt was seen as particularly controversial coming less than 18 months before @entity7 votes on leaving the rest of the @entity37			1
some will hope that mr @entity3 's push for independence will be bolstered by @entity20 's victory over @entity41 in straight sets last night			1
but his decision to wave the blue and white @entity7 flag around was not seen as being particularly statesmanlike , hiding a flag in the handbag of his wife @entity47			1
the moment the nation was gripped by @entity20 's historic @entity10 victory , the first minister of @entity7 was rummaging in his wife 's handbag			1
@entity3 knew a @entity24 triumphing in the greatest tennis contest on earth presented him with a pr coup and he was going to take it			2
even better was the chance to dangle the @entity6 behind @entity19 's head			2
but the row that has erupted is about more than whether it was statesmanlike behaviour			0
on 18 september 2014 @entity7 will stage a referendum on leaving the @entity37 after 300 years , and mr @entity3 is desperate to prove an independent @entity7 can compete on the world stage			1
he will hope that @entity20 's victory will bolster his chances of reversing dire opinion polls which suggest his dream of independence will be defeated			2
@entity20 has refused to be drawn on it , insisting he wants to ' read more about the issue '			2
the vast @entity6 also appeared to far exceed @entity72 rules which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft			0
the regulations also ban objects or clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification intended for ‘ ambush marketing ’			0
but mr @entity3 claimed no - one stuck to the rules			1
' i think a rule more observed in its breaking than its observation			0
' but can i just point out , the @entity72 did n’t mind in the slightest , they ’re really nice people , and if the @entity72 did n’t mind , i really do n’t think anybody else should either			0
' he also argued he should be given some leeway , with @entity20 the first @entity24 to win @entity10 for 117 years			1
mr @entity3 told @entity92 's today programme : ' you ’ve just been saying about it ’s the first triumph since @entity95 in 77 years			1
' it ’s the first scot since @entity97 in 1896 – it ’s not something that happens very often , so i think a few saltires hoisted over @entity10 does n’t really harm at all			2
' this was after the match was finished , incidentally			0
this was part of the celebration			0
' and the answer is no , i am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal box			0
' i had the flag last year , actually – i just did n’t get the chance to wave it last year			0
' however the incident provoked a flurry of comment on @entity114 , where it was described as an instance of ‘ photo - bombing ’ – when someone spoils a photo by sneaking into the frame , usually to poke fun at somebody			1
mr @entity3 insisted he had not planned to target mr @entity19 , adding : ' i had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case			1
' but education secretary @entity128 suggested it was inappropriate behaviour for @entity10 's @entity130			1
he told @entity131 : ' i think there is a difference between how you might behave in the @entity130 in @entity10 and how you might behave in @entity135 if a @entity7 football team were to win			1
' i think it was a wee bit of a stunt ... my advice to @entity3 would just be " put it away dear "			1
' ' bit sad ' : @entity3 's flag - waving antics attracted some criticism on @entity114 from fellow politicians including the former deputy prime minister @entity144 @entity20 poses with the @entity145 during the medal ceremony for his gold medal at the @entity148 it is 77 years since a @entity37 man - @entity95 - won a @entity10 singles title			1
but it is 117 years since a @entity153 , @entity97 , triumphed - giving @entity3 the chance to whip out his @entity6			2
@entity97 was born in @entity155 in 1867 but spent most of his life in @entity157			0
at his @entity10 debut in 1890 he crashed out in the first round , reaching the semis in 1891 and 1892			2
he took time out to train in @entity161 before returning to defeat @entity163 @entity162 in the final , 6 – 2 , 6 – 8 , 5 – 7 , 8 – 6 , 6 – 3			0
he went on to win a silver medal in the men 's singles at the @entity167			2
former deputy prime minister @entity144 wrote on @entity114 : ‘ @entity3 photo - bombing @entity19			1
bit sad was n’t it ? ’ @entity92 reporter @entity170 joked : ‘ @entity3 waves a @entity6 from @entity130			2
is there a referendum coming ? ’ journalist @entity174 posted : ‘ @entity3 is usually a consummate politician			2
' but today he was a grade - one wally			0
’ comedian @entity175 wrote : ‘ i ’m pro-independence , but put the flag away @entity3 - f * * * * * * grow up			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity177 scrambling for the @entity145			0
’ songwriter @entity178 asked on @entity114 : ‘ no matter how genuine or heartfelt , surely @entity3 reaching for the @entity6 whilst cameras watching would be seen as opportunistic ? ’ @entity183 , editor of @entity185 website @entity186 wrote : ‘ anyone spot @entity3 waving the @entity6 behind @entity19 ’s head ? obvious what he was trying to do			2
you ’ve got no class @entity3 , no class			0
’ labour peer @entity190 said there is a ‘ time and place ’ for such a stunt			0
but deputy first minister @entity196 leapt to the defence of her boss			0
‘ hey folks , waving the @entity6 is n’t political , ’ she wrote on her @entity114 account			0
‘ it ’s showing enormous pride that a boy from @entity204 just won @entity10			0
’ mr @entity3 later hailed @entity20 as the ' @entity205 ' whose victory over @entity207 in straight sets may be the ' pinnacle of @entity7 sporting triumph '			1
speaking on @entity211 , mr @entity3 said : ' it 's right up there , it 's up there with @entity215 , or @entity216 and the @entity217			1
' it 's an amazing victory			0
@entity219 , @entity220 in the @entity221			0
it 's probably the pinnacle			0
he says it 's the pinnacle of tennis , this might be the pinnacle of @entity7 sporting triumph			2
' it 's an absolutely astonishing triumph			0
' mr @entity3 also revealed he is planning further celebrations in @entity7 to capitalise on @entity20 's extraordinary victory			1
when asked what plans there were to honour the sportsman , mr @entity3 added : ' he 's already got the freedom of @entity234			1
' i was thinking of a reception in @entity234 , which has got a nice sort of home town ring to it with @entity204 , something like that			0
' but @entity20 is king of @entity7 , he can have anything he likes			1
' criticism : former deputy prime minister @entity144 was one of the first to ridicule mr @entity3 's flag stunt gaffe : broadcaster @entity246 thought it was funny that the tv cameras did not linger on the @entity6 @entity114 user @entity249 suggested an @entity163 staged a similar stunt dark side : political scientist @entity252 posted this joke on @entity114 greeting : the two men appeared to exchange friendly words as they took their seats in the royal box to watch @entity20 take on @entity41 concentration : mr @entity3 and mr @entity19 watched from the royal box as the two finalists battled it out in sweltering heat on @entity8 should @entity20 be given a knighthood for winning @entity10 ? mr @entity3 ’s spokesman earlier defended the decision to take a large @entity6 into @entity8 said : ‘ @entity7 feels enormous pride that a young man from @entity204 has won @entity10			1
' with flags of all kinds flying around @entity10 and even a @entity6 above @entity270 , one extra @entity6 among a sea of flags seems like a fair way to celebrate			2
’ the @entity72 declined to comment on the incident			0
@entity20 was criticised after joking before the 2006 @entity275 that he would be supporting anyone other than @entity163 in the competition			0
he has not indicated which way he will vote in next year ’s referendum on @entity7 independence , but he warned his countrymen not to let their heart rule their head			2
in an interview with @entity7 on sunday earlier this year , he said : ‘ i want to read more about the issue			0
' i do n’t think you should judge the thing on emotion , but on what is best economically for @entity7			0
