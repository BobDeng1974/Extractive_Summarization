by @entity1 reporter published : 03:27 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 03:53 est , 26 july 2012 @entity2 , pictured in 2010 , had a windpipe transplant made with his own stem cells a @entity6 boy who made medical history by having a new windpipe built from his own stem cells is still doing well two years after the operation			1
doctors say @entity2 , 13 , from @entity11 , has grown four inches in height and returned to school since the surgery			1
he is continuing to live a normal life free from medication to stop his immune system rejecting the transplant			2
@entity2 was the first child in the world to undergo the pioneering tracheal transplant			1
the procedure involved seeding stem cells taken from @entity2 's bone marrow into the collagen " skeleton " of a donor windpipe stripped of its own cells			1
once the structure was implanted , the stem cells matured , grew and divided to create a new organ			0
a groundbreaking feature of the treatment was that the stem cells were allowed to mature in @entity2 's body , rather than in a laboratory " bioreactor "			1
@entity2 , a keen drummer , underwent the operation at @entity39 's @entity38 in march 2010			1
the surgery was a desperate attempt to save his life after earlier treatment failed			2
the boy was born with a condition called @entity46 which left him with a very narrow windpipe , making it hard to breathe			0
a follow - up report published in @entity51 medical journal today said the new organ had strengthened and showed no signs of rejection			0
doctors called for more research to speed up the recovery of future patients and increase the availability of donor windpipes , or tracheas			0
dr @entity61 from @entity62 prepares a windpipe for a teenage transplant patient in 2010 @entity65 , professor of laryngology at @entity67 , said : ' since the treatment plan for @entity2 was devised in an emergency , we used a novel mix of techniques that have proved successful in treating other conditions			2
' to minimise delays , we bypassed the usual process of growing cells in the laboratory over a period of weeks , and instead opted to grow the cells inside the body , in a similar manner to treatments currently being trialled with patients who have had heart attacks			0
' we need more research on stem cells grown deliberately inside the body , rather than grown first in a laboratory over a long time			2
' this research should help to convert one - off successes such as this into more widely available clinical treatments for thousands of children with severe tracheal problems worldwide			0
' prof @entity65 was a member of the transplant team led by professor @entity95 , from @entity38 .			0
