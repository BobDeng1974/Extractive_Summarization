by @entity0 the destruction of @entity5 's @entity4 rainforest has slowed to its lowest level since monitoring began , it was announced yesterday			1
satellite images showed that 1,798 square miles of the @entity4 were slashed and burned between august 2011 and july 2012 , said @entity5 's environment minister @entity9			1
that 's 27 per cent less than the 2,478 square miles cut down a year earlier			1
the @entity4 constitutes more than half of the planet 's remaining rainforest , and it is also the largest and most species - rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world			0
@entity5 contains 63 per cent of the vast rainforest 's 2.4million square miles			1
the space institute said the latest figures show @entity5 is close to its 2020 target of reducing deforestation by 80 per cent from 1990 levels			1
through to july 2012 rates of deforestation have dropped by 76.26 per cent			1
@entity39 a director of @entity41 , @entity5 's environmental protection agency , said stricter enforcement of environmental laws and improved surveillance technology are behind the drop in deforestation levels			1
virgin @entity4 jungle in @entity49 , one of the @entity5 states of greatest deforestation : the @entity4 constitutes more than half of the planet 's remaining rainforest and is home to a huge range of species the destruction of the @entity4 began in earnest in the @entity60 with farmers slashing and burning forests to make space for crop cultivation			1
colonists found soils were only productive for a limited time , spurring them to clear more and more forest and causing widespread environmental damage			2
however , even before the introduction of large scale agriculture , humans have long had an impact on the @entity4 basin			0
archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants settled the region at least 11,200 years ago , and by @entity79 some 5million people may have lived in the region			0
@entity81 , the first @entity82 to travel along the @entity83 , reported a complex civilisation flourishing on its banks in the 1540s			0
other evidence suggests the forests , rather than being pristine wilderness , have in fact been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices like forest gardening			0
@entity94 ( black earth ) , which is distributed over large areas in the @entity4 , is now widely accepted as a product of soil management indicating portions of the forest are the result of centuries of human shaping			0
it is thought many of the region 's original indigenous inhabitants were wiped out by the spread of diseases like smallpox carried by @entity82 explorers			0
mr @entity39 said that in the 12 - month period a total of 2,000 square meters of illegally felled timber were seized by government agents			2
the impounded lumber is sold in auctions and the money obtained is invested in environmental preservation programs			2
ms @entity9 said @entity5 will next year start using satellite monitoring technology to detect illegal logging and slash - and - burn activity and issue fines			2
@entity123 , a senior researcher at @entity124 , an environmental watchdog agency , said : ' over the past several years @entity5 has made a huge effort to contain deforestation and the latest figures testify to its success			1
' the deforestation figures are extremely positive , for they point to a consistent downward trend			2
' ' the numbers disprove the argument that deforestation is necessary for the country 's economy to grow ' , he said by telephone from his office in the @entity4 city of @entity140			0
' deforestation has been dropping steadily for the past four years while the economy has grown , ' he said ' but the war is far from over			0
we still have a lot of battles to fight and win			0
' @entity147 , @entity148 coordinator in the @entity4 region , said the lower figures show that reducing deforestation is perfectly possible			1
but he added that ' the numbers are still too high for a country that does not have to destroy one single hectare in order to develop			0

rate of deforestation has fallen by 27 per cent in the year to july compared with previous 12 months
officials claim stricter enforcement of environmental laws and improved surveillance helped to deter loggers
@entity148 *welcomes* *announcement* , but says destruction must still be halted entirely
