it sounds like a tough sell - water created from human waste			1
however , @entity3 has backed a new hi - tech water plant than could bring clean water to @entity6 - and has even drunk it			1
the @entity9 founder has backed a @entity12 firm 's radical machine that uses a combination of steam and filters to convert human waste into water the firm says it indistinguishable from bottled water			1
' at least 2 billion , use latrines that are n’t properly drained , while others simply defecate out in the open			2
the waste contaminates drinking water for millions of people , with horrific consequences : diseases caused by poor sanitation kill some 700,000 children every year , and they prevent many more from fully developing mentally and physically			1
called the @entity38 , the new kind of low - cost waste treatment plant has been backed by the @entity41 , and is about to be tested in @entity42 for the first time			1
' i watched the piles of feces go up the conveyer belt and drop into a large bin , ' said @entity3 on his blog			2
' they made their way through the machine , getting boiled and treated			2
' a few minutes later i took a long taste of the end result : a glass of delicious drinking water			1
' in the video showing the moment @entity3 drinks the water , he does look slightly concerned			1
however , after a taste , he laughs			2
' it tastes as good as anything i 've drunk out of a bottle , ' he said			2
' and having studied the engineering behind it , i would happily drink it every day			2
' each roughly $ 1.5 - million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people , the firm behind it says			0
the machine runs at such a high temperature ( 1000 degrees @entity74 ) that there ’s no nasty smell ; in fact it meets all the emissions standards set by the @entity80 government			0
each roughly $ 1.5 - million plant can process sewage for a community of about 100,000 people , the firm behind it says			0
' it ’s the ultimate example of that old expression : one man ’s trash is another man ’s treasure , ' said @entity3			0
@entity3 says @entity92 toilets are n’t the answer , ' because they require a massive infrastructure of sewer lines and treatment plants that just is n’t feasible in many poor countries			0
so a few years ago our foundation put out a call for new solution			0
' the plan is for the @entity103 to act as a safe repository for human waste			0
in many places without modern sewage systems , truckers take the waste from latrines and dump it into the nearest river or the ocean — or at a treatment facility that does n’t actually treat the sewage			0
' if we get it right , it will be a good example of how philanthropy can provide seed money that draws bright people to work on big problems , eventually creating a self - supporting industry , ' says @entity3			0
' our foundation is funding @entity123 to do the development			0
' it ’s really amazing to see how they ’ve embraced the work ; founder @entity123 and his family have traveled to @entity6 and @entity129 multiple times so they can see the scope of the problem			1
' the machines heats the sludge until it boils , and water exits the dryer as steam			1
at this temperature , pathogens can not survive			0
while the water is in the vapour phase , it is filtered to remove particles			1
the contraption then take this bio-safe steam and condense it to water before putting it through water treatment			1
the machine 's water treatment adjusts the @entity150 , and uses multiple filters to ensure safe , clear , great tasting water			2
the water is indistinguishable from bottled water			1
the foundation now plans to set up an @entity103 in @entity155 , @entity42 , where they ’ll study everything from how you connect with the local community ( the team is already working with leaders there ) to how you pick the most convenient location			0
they will also test a system of sensors and webcams that will let @entity123 ’s engineers control the processor remotely and communicate with the team in @entity155 so they can diagnose any problems that come up .			0

@entity38 uses steam , *incineration* and filtration to create water
claims final product is identical to bottled water
could bring water to remote @entity6 *villages*
