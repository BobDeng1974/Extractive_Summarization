by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has admitted that @entity3 should n't have pushed for the late winner in their heartbreaking defeat against @entity6 , and instead should have settled for the draw			1
his @entity9 team - mate @entity8 gave the @entity11 side the lead before half time , but a close range @entity14 effort pulled the @entity3 level			1
@entity18 's side then spent the closing stages pushing for a winner , only to be hit by @entity8 going the other way , and @entity2 knows that @entity3 should have been more cautious in their approach			1
consoled : @entity2 is embraced by club mate @entity8 after @entity3 's heartbreaking defeat acceptance : @entity2 admits that @entity3 should have controlled the game better in the closing stages ' we never managed the game well enough when we got the equaliser			1
we ca n’t give chances to @entity8 because he buries them from that position , ' @entity2 told reporters after the game			1
' i just thought we needed to be a bit more clever , a bit more cute and a bit more difficult to beat			2
' maybe accept that going for a point might have been the best option			0
' at 1 - 1 as a team we sort of went for the second goal and maybe we should have been more experienced and gone for the draw			2
' the 34 - year - old spoke of his disappointment about @entity3 's campaign , arguing that their performances against @entity47 and @entity6 have warranted better than a pointless return			1
key moment : gerrard with defenders @entity50 and @entity52 after their defeat trudged : the captain walking down the tunnel deflated at the end of the game ' i ’m sort of frustrated because looking at the two games and how we have performed , we sort of deserve something out of either one of them if not both of them , ' he added			0
' i do n’t think i am standing here saying we were poor in both games and our gameplan was wrong			0
' at this level it is such a cruel level			0
you ca n’t give world class players chances – that ’s one thing – and when you are still in the game you need to be more difficult to beat and that was the disappointing thing for me			0
' @entity47 are a fantastic team and capable of winning both games but we 're clutching at straws			2
the position we 're in is the position we did n't want to be in coming into the tournament , relying on other people 's results			0
it 's very difficult at the moment			0

@entity3 should have settled for the draw against @entity6 , admits @entity2
@entity8 gave @entity6 the lead before @entity14 equaliser
but @entity9 forward struck late on to break @entity3 ' hearts
if @entity47 fail to beat @entity92 on *friday* , then @entity3 will be *eliminated*
