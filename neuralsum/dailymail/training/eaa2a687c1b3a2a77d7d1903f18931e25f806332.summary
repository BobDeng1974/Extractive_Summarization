a bombshell hidden - camera video released wednesday airs a claim that @entity4 sen. @entity3 has privately told gay rights activists he supports a redefinition of marriage to include gay and lesbians unions			1
@entity3 , who is in a tight reelection battle , has publicly maintained an anti-gay - marriage stance in the red state in order to stay electable			1
' i support traditional marriage , and i 've been pretty clear on that for a long time , ' sen. @entity3 said in a may 31 news broadcast on @entity19 in the city of @entity21			1
but one of the state 's prominent gay rights leaders told an undercover investigator with @entity26 , a conservative group known for its ' gotcha ' videos , that @entity3 has assured gay marriage advocates he 's on their side			1
' if you tell anyone i told you that , i 'm gon na find you , and i 'll kill you , ' the activist , @entity32 , says in the video after confiding in the hidden camera - wearing covert operative			1
she spoke to a man posing as a gay man who said his wealthy partner was considering making a large donation to support @entity3 's reelection effort			1
' i 'm having some misgivings about it , given his marriage stance , ' he tells her			0
@entity32 replies while @entity3 is ' not going to openly come out and say , " oh yeah , i support it " , ' he changes his position ' if you ask him personally , just people - to - people			1
' asked if she has personally had that conversation with the senator , @entity32 explains , ' oh , yeah , ' adding that @entity3 had told her ' i 'm not against ' gay marriage equality and that he is ' not going to outlaw it			1
' ' he said to a small group , like , " hey , you know , i ’m not going to try to outlaw it , you know			0
i do n’t think you should be discriminated against " , ' @entity32 says on camera			2
' no , he ’s not a bad person			0
' @entity32 did not respond to phone , @entity82 , @entity84 text and messages seeking comment			0
the @entity3 campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about the senator 's position on gay marriage			1
@entity3 's main opponent , @entity93 rep. @entity93 , has not wavered from his anti-gay - marriage position			1
' i believe that marriage is between one man and one woman , ' he told @entity99 in may			2
@entity93 holds a 4.4 percentage - point lead in an average of recent polls , according to @entity103			2
@entity3 's seat could be one of six the @entity106 needs to flip in order to cement control over both houses of @entity110			2
@entity3 is one of only a few @entity112 senators – @entity114 sen. @entity113 and @entity116 sen. @entity115 are the others – who publicly oppose a wave of state laws validating the right of gays and lesbians to legally marry			1
in red states , openly embracing a politically progressive position like marriage rights for gays and lesbians can spell doom for a @entity112 candidate if republicans make it the centerpiece of attack ads. @entity112 @entity4 governor @entity132 has also said publicly that he opposes gay marriage			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity134 told the @entity135 last year that the senator had a ' moral belief that marriage is between a man and a woman , ' and believed that homosexuality is a choice and not an inborn trait of biology			1
those positions are now ripe for speculation in the light of wednesday 's video exposé			0
@entity32 , the @entity112 activist , confirmed in a follow - up phone call what @entity3 had said privately @entity3 ( right ) and his main opponent , @entity93 rep. @entity93 ( left ) debated monday night , but the gay marriage issue was n't raised @entity26 founder @entity154 told @entity155 that in @entity4 , ' key workers , donors , supporters and elected officials have an expectation that their @entity112 @entity162 candidates are lying in order to gain votes and it does n't bother them one bit			1
' ' we are talking about a casual disregard for the truth from the grassroots all the way to the top			0
' his video includes a second admission from @entity175 , @entity4 mayor @entity176 , that ' the sad thing about politics ' in his home state is that ' people ca n't stand up and say what they really , really want to do and believe in			2
' @entity154 is known for his take - no - prisoners sneak attacks and over-the - top video dramatizations			0
in one video this year , he staged a @entity189 border infiltration by a man dressed in an @entity192 costume , rolling video as the man waded across the @entity195 from @entity196			0
in another he demonstrated how an @entity198 - infected jihadi from the @entity200 terror army could motorboat across @entity201 from @entity202 without a challenge , and stroll into the @entity204 in @entity205 , @entity206			0
but it 's his political hit pieces that generate the most media attention			0
in 2013 his operatives filmed wireless phone company employees passing out ' @entity213 phones , ' free mobile phones paid for with @entity189 tax dollars , to people who said they would sell them for drugs , shoes , handbags and spending cash			0
last week @entity154 released a surreptitiously made video showing supporters and staffers of @entity162 hopeful @entity224 saying that she was playing a ' lying game ' by publicly supporting her state 's coal industry			1
' you know she has to say that , ' one campaign staffer says on tape , ' because in @entity235 if you do n’t support the coal industry you are dead			0
' @entity32 , chair of the @entity40 of @entity236 , is chummy with @entity4 gov. @entity132 – another red - state @entity237 who says publicly that he opposes marriage rights for gays @entity241 : the @entity56 is a politically active gay and lesbian group within @entity40 for @entity4 , and its energetic liberal campaigners have the ear of progressive pols throughout the state gay rights has had a pendulum - like trajectory in @entity4 , one that provides hints to sen. @entity3 's leanings			1
@entity255 was illegal in @entity4 between its 1836 founding and the passage of a 1976 law decriminalizing it			0
one year later @entity3 's father , then - governor @entity259 , signed a second bill once again making the practice illegal , following a widely publicized case of two men engaging in oral sex in a @entity266 , @entity4 ' drunk tank ' holding cell			2
that law stood until 2002 when the @entity269 declared it unconstitutional			0
it was sen. @entity3 , then the state 's attorney general , who made the decision to let the ruling stand and not appeal it to the @entity189 @entity269			1
but he later conceded that in 2004 he voted against a statewide ballot initiative banning gay marriage			2
that measure passed , but was overturned in may 2014 by a state circuit judge			0
' my position on that specifically is well - documented , ' he said in video footage released days later by the conservative @entity282 , an opposition research group			0
' that was a ballot initiative here in @entity4 ... i voted for the amendment to ban gay marriage in @entity4			1
' as a senator , his recent record on gay rights has been a continuing study in u-turns			0
in 2010 @entity3 stunned @entity293 with a flip - flop on the repeal of the @entity298 's ' @entity297 ' policy , a @entity300 - era directive that banned gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military			2
' on many previous occasions , i have said that i would oppose repeal , ' he conceded , announcing his change of heart			0
@entity3 is the latest in a long string of left - leaning @entity189 political candidates stung by hard - charging conservative video provocateur @entity154 @entity176 , @entity112 mayor of the northeast @entity4 town of @entity175 , told @entity154 's undercover cameraman that politicians often ca n't be candid about their beliefs when votes are on the line but a 2012 @entity162 bill proposing to ban discrimination against gays in federal workplaces has yet to receive his endorsement , despite co-sponsorships from all 52 of his fellow @entity323 , plus two republicans and both independents			1
during the 2009 - 2010 congressional session , according to @entity326 , @entity3 enjoyed an 80 per cent positive rating from the @entity329 , @entity189 's most vocal gay rights policy group			2
two years later his rating fell to 70 per cent			0
this year , as his electoral deadline approached , that rating stands at 60 per cent			0
if @entity38 , the @entity40 of @entity4 activist , is right , @entity3 may soon swing back toward full agreement			1
' if @entity336 is telling the truth , then @entity3 is lying , ' @entity154 says in his video			2
but for now , with @entity340 less than three weeks away , the endangered @entity4 senator is sticking to his guns .			0

@entity154 , a conservative *filmmaker* known for *guerrilla* *documentaries* targeting liberals , sent a hidden camera into a recent @entity112 *fundraising* event in @entity4
the leader of the state 's @entity40 gay caucus explained that while sen. @entity3 publicly opposes gay marriage , he privately supports it
' if you tell anyone i told you that , i 'm gon na find you , and i 'll kill you , ' said the activist , @entity32
undercover spy posed as a gay man whose wealthy partner was considering donating to @entity3 but questioned his position on the issue
@entity3 is in a tight *re-election* fight against conservative @entity93 congressman @entity93 , who *forcefully* opposes gay marriage
@entity4 is one of only a few red states where @entity237 pols have publicly shunned gay marriage advocates in order to stay electable
