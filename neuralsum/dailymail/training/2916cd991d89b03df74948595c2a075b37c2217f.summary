if you ’re the type of woman who calms down quickly after a row , congratulations			2
your relationship is on solid ground – no matter how long your other half sulks for			0
according to research , the happiest marriages are those where the wife cools off quickly after a fight , even if her husband stays angry			1
the secret to wedded bliss ? when it comes to keeping the peace , it is more important for wives to calm down after a heated argument than husbands scientists said that women are better at starting those difficult conversations that will solve the problem and allow both parties to move on – but only if they have regained their composure first			0
and ironically , they found that if the husband attempts to start those conversations himself , his spouse will criticise him for trying to resolve things too quickly			0
lead author @entity31 , an assistant psychology professor at @entity33 and @entity34 universities in the @entity35 , said : ‘ when it comes to managing negative emotion during conflict , wives really matter			0
emotions such as anger and contempt can seem very threatening for couples			0
‘ but our study suggests that if spouses , especially wives , are able to calm themselves , their marriages can continue to thrive			0
’ the researchers studied more than 80 middle - aged and older couples by videotaping them and analysing how they interacted , taking into account factors including body language , facial expressions , tone of voice and conversation topics			2
according to @entity61 , ‘ time and again they found that marriages in which wives quickly calmed down during disputes were ultimately shown to be the happiest , both in the short and long run ’			1
in contrast , the husband ’s emotional regulation had ‘ little or no bearing on long - term marital satisfaction ’			1
the happiest marriages were those in which women used what the researchers called ‘ constructive communication ’ to temper disagreements			1

‘ this may not work so well for husbands , whom wives often criticise for leaping into problem - solving mode too quickly			0
’ the research was part of the long - term monitoring of 156 heterosexual couples in @entity89			1
every five years since 1989 they have updated researchers on how happy their marriages are			2
moving on : time and again , the researchers found that marriages in which wives quickly calmed down during disputes were ultimately shown to be the happiest , both in the short and long run			1
