one day @entity0 felt excruciating pain shoot through his lower back and buttocks thousands of @entity4 have foot drop - weakness or paralysis in one foot that can result in a limp			1
one cause is a slipped disc , so a back operation may be the answer			1
@entity13 , 53 , a planning manager from @entity14 , had the surgery , as he tells @entity16			1
the patient for three decades i 've had problems with lower back pain - at 24 i was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis , which is a kind of rheumatoid arthritis ; as a result the joints in my lower back and hips had become inflamed			1
i was told the bones can eventually fuse and stiffen , and that i could end up in a wheelchair if the ones in my backbone fused , so i was determined to stay healthy			0
fortunately i 've been able to keep the condition reasonably well controlled with medication and physiotherapy			0
even so , i 've had years of lower back pain - and by two years ago i could only manage to play golf a few times a year , whereas i used to play every week			2
a colleague recommended back specialist @entity38 and my gp was happy to refer me - i have private healthcare through work			0
i had my first appointment in february last year and he sent me for more physiotherapy and said the next stage would be a nerve block injection in my back			2
however , a month later , getting up from a chair at work one morning , i felt excruciating pain shoot through my lower back and buttocks			2
i could n't feel my right leg at all and it dragged on the ground when i walked , forcing me to limp			2
thinking i 'd trapped a nerve , i walked to a nearby shop to try to relieve it by moving - what should have been a three - minute journey took 45 minutes			2
a colleague took me home and my gp agreed i should see mr @entity61 again the next week			0
my foot stayed numb - i could n't drive : my wife @entity63 had to do everything			0
mr @entity61 sent me for an mri scan , which showed i had a slipped disc in my back that was squashing a nerve			1
this was what had been causing my back pain , he explained , but because this nerve controls movement and sensation in the lower leg , i also could n't lift my foot - a problem known as foot drop			1
@entity0 had a slipped disc that was squashing a nerve that controls movement and sensation in the lower leg he explained that he could operate to remove part of the disc and make room for the nerve			1
the sooner this was done , he said , the better my chances of a full recovery , as compressing a nerve for too long can damage it for good , causing permanent loss of sensation and movement in the foot			1
i had the hour - long operation ten days later			0
i had a morphine shot when i woke and paracetamol for two days , but the back pain had gone completely			0
over the next few weeks sensation gradually returned to my leg and after six weeks i was able to drive again			1
i had months of physiotherapy and by december i was back on the golf course and even going jogging			0
the surgeon @entity38 is consultant neurosurgeon at @entity102 and @entity103			0
proportion of people with a slipped disc who need surgery around 25,000 @entity4 a year are diagnosed with foot drop			1
it can be caused by stroke , multiple sclerosis , motor neurone disease , muscle damage , @entity108 's or diabetes , and it also affects around 5 per cent of patients with lumbar disc prolapse ( slipped disc )			1
slipped discs affect around a million @entity4 a year			2
the spine is made up of 24 individual bones , and in between them are cushioning discs			0
sometimes the inner part of a disc , which is made of a jelly - like material , bulges out , compressing nerves in the spinal cord			1
we do n't fully understand why this can cause foot drop - perhaps because blood supply to the nerve that controls the lower leg is restricted			1
patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( around 200,000 in the @entity4 ) are slightly more at risk because it can cause bones in the spine to thicken , narrowing the available space in the spinal column			0
a doctor removed part of the disc and make room for the nerve while this does n't make a disc any more likely to prolapse , the smaller space does mean the nerve is more likely to be squashed			1
however , in @entity0 's case his condition was well controlled so the two were not linked			0
with a slipped disc , doctors and patients often want to wait to see how it progresses , relying on painkillers , as in 80 per cent of cases the pain will resolve without surgery			1
however , i think the situation with foot drop from a slipped disc is different , as waiting can mean it may be too late to correct the problem , if the nerve is too damaged			1
there is no clear guidance on treatment			0
but in my view surgery should be offered early , especially in patients with a large disc prolapse and whose foot drop has only been present for a short time			2
i 'd like to see a proper trial conducted so @entity177 , surgeons and patients know how great the chances of success are likely to be			0
the standard procedure for a slipped disc is microdiscectomy - surgery to remove the material pressing on the nerve			1
the operation takes less than an hour under general anaesthetic			0
first i make a 1 - 1.5cm incision in the middle of the lower back , and move the back muscles to one side			1
i then work through a tube , around 1cm in diameter , which i insert through the space i 've made between the muscles			0
i make an incision through the tissue between the vertebra above the damaged disc , and move the compressed nerve gently to one side , using a microscope to see it			1
then i cut away the protruding part of the disc			1
i move the nerve back into place and close the incision with stitches			2
some patients go home that day , others stay overnight			0
recovery is three to four weeks			0
@entity212 ? ' disc surgery , whether to treat pain or foot drop , carries a risk of 1 to 2 per cent of infection around the disc , ' says @entity219 , consultant spinal surgeon at @entity220 and @entity221			2
' there is also a 1 to 2 per cent risk of damage to the nerve , causing neuropathic pain which can be permanent , and a risk of increased back pain because you are cutting muscles and ligaments			2
' surgery may also weaken the spine , increasing the risk of another disc prolapse			2
' where there is pressure on the nerve and the weakness is getting worse over a few weeks , there is evidence that patients can be helped by surgery			0
' the operation costs around £ 6,500 privately , £ 3,800 to the @entity245			0
it is available for foot drop at the surgeon 's discretion .			0

@entity13 , 53 , from @entity14 , had a slipped disk which squashed a nerve
the nerve controls movement and sensation in the lower leg
he had an op to remove part of the disc and make room for the nerve
