that little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is , in fact , simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells			2
now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this ' voice ' and ruin a dieter 's good intentions			0
the new research , done on fish and mice , could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume			0
the research focused on @entity19 neurons , which are a structure called the hypothalamus , that send and receive signals to regulate appetite			1

on the right : when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted , the cells no longer make it the research focused on @entity19 neurons , which are a structure called the hypothalamus , that send and receive signals to regulate appetite			1
when @entity19 neurons are absent , or not working properly , animals and humans grow dangerously obese			1
the new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the @entity19 cells are n't working			1
the team , led by the @entity46 , looked at how a protein called a transcription factor , and two small stretches of @entity50 called enhancers , act as triggers for the @entity19 gene			2
all three regulate how often and when the @entity19 cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body			1
that little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is , in fact , simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells			0
now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this ' voice ' ' the @entity19 region is a central node of the brain 's means for regulating body weight , in response to influences from the hormone leptin , ' said @entity77 , a professor in the @entity78			2
like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway , enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read			0
located deep inside the brain , in a structure called the hypothalamus , the cluster of @entity19 neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger			1
they take in signals from the body , and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating			0
when @entity19 neurons are absent , or not working correctly , animals and humans grow dangerously obese			1
the latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the @entity19 cells are n't working			1
the researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another , both encouraging the expression of the @entity19 gene at key times			0
mice born without both of them became obese – as if their @entity19 gene had been deactivated			2
the protein that latches on to the enhancer , called a transcription factor , is also vital			0
in the new @entity122 paper , the researchers report that the transcription factor @entity124 1 , encoded by the @entity126 gene , plays this important role for @entity19			0
when the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making @entity124 1 halfway through pregnancy , the fetal mice failed to develop any @entity19 cells			1
' taken together , this work represents the first example of a neuron - specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult , ' says @entity77			0
looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex – and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved			0
but in theory , it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of @entity19 gene products , or to help silence it			0
' for humans , @entity19 regulation may be part of the equation of weight control , ' says @entity77			2
' we do n't know , but we think it likely , that it may be similar to the mouse model , where its role is like a dial , with a linear relationship between the amount of @entity19 expression and the degree of obesity			2

the research looked at @entity19 neurons that work *toregulate* appetite
when @entity19 neurons are absent , animals and humans grow obese
this also happens when genes inside the @entity19 cells are n't working
