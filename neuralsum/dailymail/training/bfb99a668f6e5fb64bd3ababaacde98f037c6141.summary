by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:05 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 18 july 2013 face of the future : @entity5 's @entity4 claimed that instead of travelling across the country for meetings , people could talk to lifelike holograms , like this one of singer @entity10 launched last year a high speed rail line linking @entity14 to the north will be rendered unnecessary within 20 years because meetings will be held between holograms , @entity12 's new business guru claimed today			1
lord @entity4 said he ' simply does n't get the logic ' of spending £ 40billion on the project when by 2033 it will be possible to talk to a ' perfect hologram of a person half way around the world sitting on a chair in front of us '			1
he became the latest senior @entity5 figure to speak out against @entity28 , after a former rail minister admitted the original price tag was ‘ written on the back of a fag packet ’			1
the latest intervention further erodes the cross-party consensus on the plan , which will take decades to build			0
the project ran into trouble when the government admitted recently that the bill had soared by £ 10billion to £ 42.6billion			2
lord @entity4 was only named by mr @entity12 as a business ambassador and adviser on enterprise last night			1
but speaking in the @entity43 today he demolished the case for @entity5 's flagship pledge to build the @entity28			2
the @entity5 manifesto in 2010 insisted a new high speed rail line linking north and south was ' at the heart of our growth plan '			0
it promised journey times will be ' slashed ' and more capacity would be freed up for freight and commuter services			0
but lord @entity4 said : ' i simply do n't get the logic of spending £ 40 billion plus just to enable people to get from @entity61 to @entity14 23 minutes earlier and @entity62 to @entity14 50 minutes earlier - for them then to be stuck in monster traffic jams on the @entity64			1
' by the time the line is built holograms will be so good , people will struggle to spot a real person , he claimed			2
hi - tech : the quality of holograms has improved in recent years , since this one by artist @entity70 in 2005 embarrassment : lord @entity4 's comments are at odds with @entity5 leader @entity12 's support for the @entity28 project the former chairman of @entity76 , who lists ' fiddling with computers ' in his interests in @entity79 , urged ministers to imagine what the world would be like in 20 years ' time when @entity28 is scheduled to be completed			1
lord @entity4 said : ' in 2033 can we imagine a technology which could transmit a perfect hologram of a person half way around the world sitting on a chair in front of us ? ' a hologram where you are hard pushed to tell the real from the image			1
if this and thousands of other technologies that are bubbling away come to pass , who in their right mind would journey to a business meeting starting early in the day and getting home late at night ? ' it 's why we should always project technology forward and factor this into all mega infrastructure decisions			2
' realistic : lord @entity4 said that in 20 years people will not be able to tell the difference between a real person and a hologram but the hi - tech vision of the future was dismissed by government spokesman @entity116 , who insisted there could be no substitute for meeting face to face			1
@entity116 added : ' while i am sure a hologram of myself in front of @entity123 or a head teacher would have been mightily impressive , i simply do n't believe that at any point in the foreseeable future we are going to do without transport			0
' however lord @entity4 is just the latest senior @entity5 figure to signal a collapse in support for the project			1
former business secretary @entity133 exploded the cross-party agreement earlier this month when he admitted it risked becoming an ' expensive mistake '			0
last night @entity137 , a rail minister in @entity139 's government , said support for it was now on the rocks			1
‘ the original cost for @entity28 was written on the back of a fag packet , ’ he told @entity144 ’s @entity143			1
‘ my own party is strongly in favour of it			0
i was until relatively recently			0
i would suspect that the whole of the @entity152 would vote at the moment to keep going ahead			0
‘ but i think the more that people talk about this … it is almost like a scepticism that dare not speak its name up until now			0
’ he said @entity133 ’s intervention in a newspaper article earlier this month was ‘ very , very good ’ and had ‘ opened up a whole debate ’			0
mr @entity162 added : ‘ i think more and more people are listening to those who are saying this might not be a great idea			0
‘ @entity167 is going to be with us for a very long time			0
‘ do we really want to tell our constituents or taxpayers that we are spending £ 50billion of their money on a train line that really does n’t need to be built and that money could spent in any number of areas far more effectively			2
’ warning : former @entity5 rail minister @entity137 said the business case for @entity28 had been ' written on the back of a fag packet ' while @entity133 now warned it could damage the north of @entity181 row : further @entity5 admissions of doubts about @entity28 are certain to be seized on by opponents of the project that it should not go ahead halt : @entity5 's @entity133 now says his party was wrong to offer fulsome backing to the high speed rail project linking @entity14 and the north @entity133 said @entity5 's plans were based on an estimated cost of £ 30 billion and on a central assumption - that its construction would spread growth across the country - which was ‘ neither quantified nor proved ’			1
but at the time @entity198 transport minister @entity197 hit back : ‘ ' it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs ; be a major boost to our economy , especially in the @entity205 ; and will help us shift to the clean , green economy of the future			2
' more and more people are using the rail network every year so we desperately need more @entity211 capacity - unlike @entity133 we ca n't all hop on a private jet			0

lord @entity4 says he no longer backs £ *42billion* project
urges ministers to look to the future and imagine life - like holograms
was only appointed @entity12 's business ambassador *yesterday*
lord @entity4 lists ' fiddling with computers ' in his interests in @entity79
*ex-rail* minister @entity137 says *budget* was set ' on back of a fag packet '
line will link @entity14 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity231
