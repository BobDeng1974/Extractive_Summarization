a would - be motorist , who has spent more than £ 5,000 on 250 lessons over a 14 - year period has been blacklisted from her local driving schools due to her failure to pass the test			1
@entity6 , 31 , has had five different driving instructors only to fail her practical test four times			1
yet , despite the intensive instruction , ms @entity6 is still unable to pull away from a junction without stalling her car			1
@entity6 , pictured , has spent more than £ 5,000 on driving lessons over the past 14 years without success ms @entity6 , pictured , said she lacks confidence when she gets behind the wheel of a car ms @entity6 , left , said her mother @entity18 , right , will give her money towards a car if she passes the driving test she said , now the situation is so bad , she can not find an instructor near her home in @entity25 , @entity26 , willing to take her because of her poor motoring skills			1
it is estimated that during her driving lessons , ms @entity6 has driven the equivalent of a road trip between @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35			1
according to ms @entity6 : ' after a few years i stopped counting how much i ’d spent			1
' it ’s definitely more than £ 5,000 now , which is crazy			1
i could have bought a brand new car for that ! ' i ca n’t give up now though , i ’ve invested too much to stop			2
' ms @entity6 started driving as soon as she was old enough , but changed instructor after 15 lessons because they did n’t get on			1
when she moved to her second teacher , she had more than 100 lessons before realising he was n’t going to put her forward for a test			2
in 2012 she chose a third instructor , before moving to a fourth expert - even sitting double lessons - without success			2
eventually she tried a fifth instructor in august last year , but failed her most recent test			1
ms @entity6 said : ' every year since 2001 , passing my driving test has been my @entity57 ’s resolution			1
' i took a break after my last test in october but i want to do an intensive week course			2
' i reckon that ’s the only way i can pass now			0
' the last time i tried to get an instructor in @entity26 nobody would take me because they know how bad i am			0
' it ’s as if i ’ve been blacklisted			0
i do n’t blame them though ! ' but ms @entity6 , pictured , said she is having difficulty finding a driving instructor willing to take her on @entity18 , left , said her daughter , right , is ' the world 's best backseat driver ' constantly offering advice despite her inability to pass her test , ms @entity6 has never had an accident and believes her problem is a lack of confidence			1
' driving does n’t come naturally to me			2
i ca n’t quite master using both legs and hands at different times			2
i ’ve had the same problem for the last 14 years			1
' i ’ve never had a crash or accident			0
everything will be going really well , calm driving , and then suddenly i fall to pieces			0
it might only be a minor thing , like i miss a junction or turn , and i ’ll be thrown completely off course			0
' everyone tells me i ’ll get over that - but 250 lessons later and i ’m still waiting			1
' now ms @entity6 plans ahead before each driving lesson , having developed a routine to help get her into the correct frame of mind			1
she revealed : ' before i get in the car , i eat a big breakfast and drink a mug of tea			0
' then , without fail , i play happy by @entity102 to get myself into a more relaxed mindset			0
i ’ve experimented with different music , but some of them would get me too pumped up			0
even with doing that i still have the same issues			0
' ms @entity6 ' mother @entity18 , 62 , has even tried to encourage her daughter with the offer of cash towards her first car			1
she said : ' i ca n’t wait for her to pass			0
“ she ’s a real diva in the car			0
despite the fact she has n’t passed her test she ’s the world ’s best backseat driver			0
she ’s always saying " @entity118 , do n’t do that " or " go here "			0
' i ’m so desperate to stop carting her round , i ’ve promised i ’ll go halves on a new car once she passes ! ' ms @entity6 said she has not given up her dream of owning her own car			1
she added : ' maybe i ’m just one of those people born to be driven			0
i ’m fed up of planning my life around train and bus timetables too			0
it takes almost twice as long as driving			0
my mum has promised to go halves on a new car once i pass so that ’s even more of an incentive			2
' ms @entity6 said she might be the type of person who is ' born to be driven ' but still plans to continue trying			2
