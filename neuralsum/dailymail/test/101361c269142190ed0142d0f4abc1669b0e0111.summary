@entity0 has urged the nation to follow his @entity3 dream as he chases the fairytale end to his extraordinary career			1
retirement beckons for @entity0 , champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997 , and he will stop riding immediately if his mount @entity8 wins the £ 1million @entity11 ’s @entity10 on saturday			1
@entity0 celebrates @entity10 victory on do n’t push it in 2010 @entity8 , trained by @entity13 , will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once - a - year punters will pin their hopes on @entity0 delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on @entity21			1
in a perfect world , the @entity10 will finish with @entity0 standing high in his irons celebrating but he , more than anyone , knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing			1
it wo n’t , however , stop the 40 - year - old hoping his script has a glorious finale			2
‘ i ’m a dreamer , ’ said @entity0 , who announced his plans to retire in february			1
‘ i ’m a believer – i always have been			2
@entity0 seeks to end record - breaking career with victory on @entity36 in the @entity10 ' if everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will happen , i can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me			1
in some ways , i regret making the announcement to retire when i did			2
i ’ve thought to myself i should have just kept quiet			0
but in other ways i think it has been good			0
‘ if it ’s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport , so much the better			0
‘ @entity52 has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back , great			0
if people are putting money on @entity36 in the hope i win for the fairytale , let me assure them nobody will be wanting me to win more than i do			0
people talk about me having ridden more winners than anyone else but i ’ve also ridden more losers than anyone else			0
a thank you message board to retiring jockey @entity0 on display at @entity3 ‘ i ’ve had 19 goes at this race and won once , so that gives you an idea of what it is going to be like			1
’ the last time a horse carried such goodwill was when @entity76 , trained by the late sir @entity75 , won the @entity77 at @entity78 in october 2012			2
mention of that brought a wry smile from @entity0			2
‘ i wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at @entity78 ! ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way ! but , listen , i ’m a positive person and that is never going to change			0
let ’s hope the dream can happen			0
’ @entity0 has vowed to end his career immediately should he land the £ 1million race for a second time			1

@entity0 will retire immediately if he wins the @entity10
