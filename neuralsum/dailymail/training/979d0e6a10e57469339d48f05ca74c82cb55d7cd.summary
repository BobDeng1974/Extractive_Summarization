@entity0 has submitted a patent that could see the company track every tv show and advert watched via its @entity6 console and other devices			1
the application called ' awards and achievements across tv ecosystem ' was submitted to the @entity12 earlier this month			1
it details plans for @entity0 to reward viewers for watching adverts , tv shows or series , with virtual scores , or physical awards such as coupons and products - although it is expected the plans will be opt - in , and not turned on by default			1
a patent applied to the @entity12 by @entity0 has unveiled plans to potentially use such technology to track what tv shows and adverts users watch , and then reward them with virtual points or physical products drawings submitted by @entity0 in its awards and @entity45 patent show how the company plans to track and reward users for watching adverts and tv shows			1
in this image the @entity31 sensor is highlighted on top of the tv , as is the console on the right - hand side			1
although it is unclear exactly what platform the plans will launch on			0
@entity0 has filed the patent in a bid to launch a system that could see viewers given virtual scores and points to put towards new items for their avatars , or download tv and videos from the @entity69 system the patent submitted by @entity0 earlier this week does n't confirm what platform the plans will apply to , or exactly how the viewing habit information will be stored			1
however , the application does states that once a user watches a relevant advert , tv show or series - called a ' user - viewing goal ' - a response will be triggered			2
the user - viewing goal will be confirmed and an award will be granted			2
the type of award is expected to then depend on the type of show or advert watched - for example an advert might award virtual points , whereas watching a whole series might result in a physical product or free download			0
virtual scores can be saved up and put towards new items for avatars			0
they can also be accessed remotely on other computers and devices			0
the application , originally found by @entity101 , said : ' television viewing tends to be a passive experience for a viewer , without many opportunities for the viewer to engage or have interactive experiences with the presented content			0
' to increase interactive viewing and encourage a user to watch one or more particular items of video content , awards and achievements may be tied to those items of video content			2
' producers , distributors , and advertisers of the video content may set viewing goals and award a viewer who has reached the goals			0
' by providing content viewing goals and awarding the viewer for reaching the goals , the present disclosure provides for an interactive television viewing experience			0
' additionally , by tying the awards and achievements to particular items of video or advertising content , viewers may be encouraged to increase their viewership of the content , thus increasing advertising opportunities			0
' the @entity6 has a built - in tv guide that can be opened using voice controls			2
if a patent application submitted by @entity0 is successful , users will be able to use this guide to search for specific tv shows and series that have rewards attached			1
users can then watch these shows to earn the rewards and put them towards new items for their avatars , or media downloads the new @entity31 sensor can register even the slightest of movements because it uses ' time of flight ' that records photons of light bouncing from the viewers body			1
under the patent 's plans , the @entity31 would potentially be able to record where on the screen your eyes look , and measure your heart rate to tell how involved you are in a tv show or gauge your response to an advert a chart , submitted in @entity0 's patent application , shows how its tv awards and achievements system could work examples given in the application include rewarding users for watching an episode , watching an ' entire series of linear video content ' , watching ' one or more commercials contained within the linear video content ' and rewarding users for ' performing a specific action while watching video content			1
' this includes one - off events such as the @entity188 , or watching series ' which could include the @entity191 spin - off announced last week , being shown exclusively on the @entity6			2
it is thought that the plans will be opt - in , and users can additionally search for and actively watch reward shows and adverts , to increase their achievements			1
the application does n't specifically state what platform the plans will relate to			0
when asked about the plans , @entity0 told the @entity202 : ' @entity0 regularly applies for and receives patents as part of its business practice ; not all patents applied for or received will be incorporated into a @entity0 product			2
' it is thought that if the plans are successful they will apply to the new @entity6 console , because of its new tv features			2
the latter reference in the application to ' performing a specific action ' suggests that the plans will tie in somehow with @entity0 's motion - sensing technology @entity31			1
the new @entity31 sensor can record eye movements and monitor heart rate			1
under the patent plans , this means @entity0 would potentially be able to record where on the screen your eyes look , and measure how involved you are in a tv show or gauge your response to an advert based on your heart rate changes			1
it can also watch you in the dark			0
photographers take photos of the new @entity6 console at the launch event in @entity236 last week			0
in a patent application filed earlier this month , the new console could track viewing habits of every user and reward them for watching certain shows or adverts @entity0 goes on to say in the application that achievements would be in the form of ' virtual awards ' - including a viewer score that could be linked to a user 's avatar and would give those avatars ' new outfits , new vehicles , new homes ' and ' virtual money to purchase different avatar items '			1
this score would then be visible to other users ' thus creating an incentive for each user to increase his or her score			0
' @entity0 continues that the virtual awards would be accessible on more than one computer or device			0
elsewhere , @entity0 also adds that physical awards may be granted			0
these are described as ' coupons , products , etc ' and could be used to put towards downloading content such as tv shows , videos and games through @entity0 's @entity69 service			1
@entity0 's completely redesigned @entity31 sensor uses ' time of flight ' and captures @entity276 of data including heart rate , weight transfer and the slightest movements of joints			1
under patent plans , users may soon be able to perform certain actions - that will be recorded using the @entity31 sensor - while watching tv shows and earn rewards @entity0 unveiled its latest xbox console - the @entity6 - at an event in @entity236 last week			1
it was described as an ' all - in - one entertainment system for a new generation ' and can be completely controlled using voice recognition and hand gestures			0
a new instant switching feature lets users ask the @entity6 to ' watch tv ' , ' open @entity296 ' or use it to change channels quickly without having to find the remote control			2
@entity0 's @entity6 also comes with a multi-tasking @entity299 that lets users run more than one service at any one time , such as watch a film while checking emails on internet explorer			1
the awards and achievement plans outlined in the recent patent application are similar to those already used by gamers on the @entity312 console			0
according to the head of @entity314 , @entity315 told @entity316 : ' @entity0 â€™s new @entity6 meets the definition of a surveillance device under some @entity320 laws , so they need to be upfront and tell customers whether anyone else can intercept their information or remotely access their device			2
' the @entity6 continuously records all sorts of personal information about me			0
' my reaction rates , my learning or emotional states			0
these are then processed on an external server , and possibly even passed on to third parties			0
the fact that @entity0 could potentially spy on my living room is merely a twisted nightmare			0
' a group of journalists try out the improved motion - detecting capabilities of the new @entity31 sensor for @entity0 's @entity6 console system			1
the new @entity31 , which will come standard with the @entity6 can also see users in total darkness and has a wider field of view than the previous @entity31 device in use with the @entity312			2

application submitted to the @entity12 office shows @entity0 's plans for tracking viewing habits of @entity6 owners
the company plans to reward viewers who watch adverts or shows with credits and achievements
the new @entity31 sensor can follow eye movements , track your reaction to shows using heart - rate monitors and see you in the dark
