artist @entity0 has insisted she is actually ' very neat ' as she unveiled her £ 2.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its ' home ' at the @entity5			1
my bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the @entity8 and displayed at @entity9 in 1999			1
now , 15 years later , it is back at the gallery on a long - term loan for at least 10 years			1
' i make my bed every day			2
it 's so boring , it 's very neat			2
i 'm really @entity30 ( obsessive compulsive disorder ) , ' she said			0
wiping away tears , the artist said that seeing the work - which is now subject to rigorous security in the form of a sensor and a guard to prevent visitors from getting too close - left her emotional			1
' i 'm 52 nearly			0
even though i was quite old when the bed came into fruition i did n't look old or behave old , ' she said			2
' i 'm a bit tearful , it means a lot to me			0
i feel pathetic but there are things on that bed that have no place in my life any more			2
' that bed belonged to a young woman and hopefully in 20 or 30 years ' time the bed will be here but i wo n't probably			1
' that 's what art 's about			0
it 's about a legacy , about making something which goes on without you			0
' it 's a statement of history and now it 's in safe hands ... it will never change			0
' the work , which expressed the artist 's suicidal depression following a relationship breakdown , is displayed in its own room alongside two paintings by @entity71 and six nude drawings by @entity18 which she has given to the @entity5			1
@entity18 said she felt validated seeing the installation on display alongside works by some of @entity9 's ' greats ' after all the criticism about the bed at the time			1
the controversial artwork was created by @entity18 in her @entity86 council flat in 1998 and features empty vodka bottles , cigarette butts , stained sheets , discarded underwear , old slippers , a waist belt and even condoms my bed was one of the key works of the 1990s @entity98 ( @entity98 ) movement and was bought by millionaire collector @entity100 for £ 150,000 in 2000 before later being sold to @entity101 's and auctioned my bed , which fetched £ 2.54million at auction last year , is now on a long - term loan to the @entity9 and will be shown at both @entity104 in @entity18 's home town - and @entity106 later this year ' i love it , why would n't i ? i was right ... it 's a good feeling ... it feels like home , ' she said , later adding that her fellow students at art school had ' thought i was a bit thick '			1
earlier in the day , @entity18 had told photographers : ' i think i look like the cat who got the cream			0
' she later added : ' my bed is a symbol of that time			2
it was perfect for that moment			0
it has captured a part of history			0
' pointing to her belt on the installation , she added : ' i would be lucky if it fitted around my thigh now and it used to fit around my waist			0
' there are so many things about that bed that do n't relate to my life any more			2
' it 's a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s in a really wild way			0
it 's not just sad , but how that bed came about was through sadness			2
' it 's also about being in the worst situation in your life and being able to pull through and get out to the other side			0
' sir @entity147 , director of the @entity5 , said : ' it 's a work we 've always wanted to bring into the collection			2
' it was quite clear from 1999 when it was first seen in the @entity8 prize that it was going to be regarded as one of those iconic works from the late 90s			1
' @entity18 insisted she was actually ' very neat ' as she unveiled the return of @entity158 at the @entity5 today			1
