the collapse of yesterday 's @entity2 trial will raise question marks about the judgment of the @entity6 darling who took a central role in the disastrous and misguided prosecutions of journalists			1
@entity11 , who ran the @entity12 for five years , was in charge when @entity14 began its tainted ' witch hunt ' into tabloid journalists			1
starting with dawn raids on suspects ' homes , mass arrests and long periods of bail , it ended in not guilty verdicts – and will now prompt a fresh examination of the tenure of the most controversial dpp of modern times			0
central role : former director of public prosecutions @entity11 was in charge of @entity14 most controversially , he pushed the use of an almost unheard of 13th century law – misconduct in public office – to go after journalists for what amounted to them simply doing their jobs of informing the public			1
despite the best efforts of prosecutors and millions of pounds of public money , juries have almost universally refused to convict , and after four more reporters were cleared yesterday and all but a handful of cases withdrawn , @entity45 was left in ruins			1
already a @entity49 and a @entity50 , in a few weeks ' time sir @entity11 is likely to add mp to his lengthy list of titles and be returned for the safe @entity6 seat of @entity55 and @entity56 in north @entity57			1
it will feel like a natural step for the son of ' guardian - reading ' parents who named him after the founder of the @entity6 , @entity63			2
current director of public prosecutions boss @entity64 ( pictured ) the 2001 ' human rights lawyer of the year ' is so admired by @entity6 it reportedly delayed candidate selection in the north @entity57 seat so he could rack up enough time as a party member to get on the list			2
with previous @entity73 , it was a largely behind closed doors role			0
but under @entity11 it was far more public			1
rather than shunning the limelight , he relished it			0
some weeks it even appeared he was holding court with the media more often than cabinet ministers			0
all pretence of political impartiality went out the window , and he repeatedly picked fights with the @entity86 , most notably on human rights and the law allowing homeowners to defend their property against intruders			2
in one clash in 2009 a @entity93 interviewer questioned his impartiality , pointing out his political background and role in a ' @entity99 ' magazine			0
he also angered the @entity86 when he said plans to scrap the @entity101 would ' shame ' @entity102			0
he also re-wrote the law on assisted suicide – quickly dubbed ' @entity105 ' – setting out circumstances in which those who help others kill themselves can expect to escape prosecution			0
