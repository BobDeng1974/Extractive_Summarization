a 21 - year - old man with depression has made the most gut - wrenching final goodbye video to his family , telling them not to blame themselves and reassuring them there is nothing they could have done to stop him taking his own life			1
while the chilling song ' @entity14 ' by @entity15 is playing in the background , the distressing three - minute footage shows @entity17 repeatedly saying that no one should take the blame for his disease and expressing his unconditional love for his mother , four siblings and his girlfriend			1
on september 14 last year , @entity17 's brother @entity25 - who is only one year younger - and their stepfather found @entity17 's body along with a usb stick containing the video sitting on top of a piece of paper which simply said : ' @entity34 and @entity35 , please watch			1
' his family have shared the heartbreaking video publicly to raise awareness of the crippling disease , which takes the lives of more young @entity40 than car accidents and skin cancer , as part of a petition to call for more beds for suicidal youths in hospitals			1
' i just want you to know that i love you all and there was nothing you could have done - it 's just me , my personality it 's who i am			0
' he then goes onto talk about his ongoing battle with depression			2
' i 've been feeling lonely for a while , i know i could get better - i keep trying to tell myself that but i just ca n't see it , ' he said			0
' i use alcohol a little bit to help me to get through but if anyone puts on this usb - i love you - there is nothing you could really do			0
' @entity17 then signs off by naming all of the most important people in his life - his parents , four siblings and his girlfriend , @entity88			1
' holly do n't blame yourself - it 's not your fault - same with my family - mum , @entity35 , @entity56 , @entity55 , @entity91 , @entity92 - all of you just did n't do it alright ? this is me , myself - i love you - goodbye			1

@entity97 said her son would still be with her today if @entity17 had not been sent home from @entity128 hospital in @entity129 11 days earlier because he was told there were not enough beds available			1
a @entity133 spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to provide any details of @entity17 's care while the coroner was still investigating the matter			1
' however , @entity139 and @entity140 did provide extensive support to mr @entity17 and sufficient mental health beds are available within the @entity144 area , ' she said			1
on september 3 , @entity97 received a hysterical phone call from her son who said he had deliberately cut himself multiple times on his leg			2
' we had to wait for four hours and then a doctor gave him 10 @entity100 and told him to get a good night 's sleep and that somebody would contact him in a week or two from the outpatients ' department , ' she said			0
' then he said to me " you can look after him ca n't you ? "			0
' i said to him " please do n't take this lightly - there is a history of mental illness in my family " and he just said that there were no beds			1
' @entity17 said in his video that his family and girlfriend were not to blame for his ' disease ' ' i 've been feeling lonely for a while , i know i could get better - i keep trying to tell myself that but i just ca n't see it , ' he said in his video although @entity17 had been suffering from depression for the past two and a half years and had spent two weeks in the hospital during that time after making an attempt on his life , @entity97 said it was the worst state that she had seen her son in			1
' i took him to my house and he was so withdrawn and crying the whole time , ' she said			0
' his best friend @entity179 and i were on 24 hour suicide watch			0
' it was the worst time of my life - i have never seen him so low			0
' ten days later , @entity17 told his mother that @entity88 was picking him up and taking him to his place so he could have a few drinks with his friends			1
the next morning , @entity97 was unable to get hold of @entity17 in her break at work so she asked her husband and @entity25 to check on him			2
' they heard music but he did n't answer the door so they broke it down and it was @entity25 who found him			0
' only a year apart in age , @entity25 and @entity17 were not only brothers but best friends			2
' @entity25 and my husband were having terrible nightmares - @entity92 kept seeing visions of @entity17 as he saw him when he broke the door down , ' @entity97 said ' the next day @entity205 offered us counselling - i just ca n't get my head around that they would n't help @entity17 when he was alive but offered us counselling after he died			2
' before @entity17 became unwell two years ago , he was a happy and outgoing boy @entity17 with his girlfriend @entity88 and his beloved dog , @entity211 , in happier times @entity97 , who works for the health department as an aged care nurse , has started a petition to call on the government to urgently implement emergency suicide training in hospitals and dedicate more beds to suicidal youths in hospitals			1
' i will hand deliver the petition to @entity223 myself and hope the bloody politicians listen , ' she said			0
' mental health is rampant in my family so if any other family members show any sign they have no hope			0
' i do n't know if i could cope losing another child i think it would be the thing that breaks me - my days are filled with fear			0
' no matter what happens , @entity97 will always treasure the fond memories of her beautiful son			0
' he was the most beautiful boy - he really loved his family - he would walk in and say " @entity239 " and give me a big hug and kiss , ' she said			2
