@entity0 will not compromise on quality in their search for homegrown players this summer			1
the proof that @entity0 have belief in @entity7 players was evident in monday night ’s @entity8 final where four of their starting line - up against @entity12 were born in @entity13			1
another two have lived there from a young age			0
@entity16 looked on with interest at @entity0 ’s @entity18			1
yet , while those fledglings carry much promise for the future , the fallen @entity20 champions have a more immediate problem : they need eight homegrown players for their first - team squad next season to meet guidelines set out by the @entity20 and are in danger of losing at least four			1
@entity0 will ask about @entity31 's availability even if @entity32 are likely to refuse to sell @entity16 watched @entity0 's academy in their @entity8 final against @entity12 on monday the @entity20 champions are also interested in signing @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 will all leave while @entity41 is expected to follow , and @entity42 will decide his fate at the end of the season			1
@entity46 and @entity47 are also ready to move			0
@entity42 ’s issue is not about money but understood to be about how many games he starts			0
he has figured in 27 @entity20 matches this season but started just 14			1
the possibility of him departing means @entity0 have had to redress their buying strategy			0
their track record of buying @entity58 has been questionable when you consider the impact made by @entity61 , @entity39 and @entity62			0
further question marks have since been placed alongside recruitment decisions of last summer after @entity0 floundered in the @entity65 and the domestic competitions			2
indeed , the pressure is on all investments to make them a stronger @entity65 proposition			0
sporting director @entity70 wants @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 from @entity74 and took a flight to @entity76 yesterday to watch @entity78 attacker @entity77 and his team - mate @entity79 , a left back			0
they want young , hungry potentially world - class players but they also need at least some of them to be homegrown			1
@entity83 could be a @entity0 player next season but @entity85 want at least £ 50m for the midfielder club chiefs will not compromise on quality and they are also interested in foreign stars including @entity71 for that reason , @entity0 have to ask about @entity31 even if @entity32 are likely to refuse to sell him			1
they have discussed signing @entity92 forward @entity36 — even though he does n’t want to be a peripheral figure — and @entity37 of @entity95 , who will soon be fit again			2
his clubmate @entity96 is another promising talent admired by @entity0			2
@entity85 ’s @entity83 and @entity98 are others constantly mentioned but here lies @entity0 ’s problem : @entity85 would want at least £ 50million for @entity83			1
it is a figure that has made @entity0 balk			0
as coach @entity16 protested : ‘ it ’s important to have @entity7 players			1
can you sign them ? to improve this squad , you ’re talking players you ca n’t get			2
either they do n’t exist or clubs wo n’t sell			0
’ the search will intensify once @entity0 finish the season but the task will only get tougher			2
@entity8 chairman @entity114 said it was ‘ depressing ’ to see @entity0 win the @entity20 with just two englishmen in their side last year and intends to introduce stricter rules on homegrown players from 2016			1
@entity16 , if he 's in charge next year , will need eight homegrown players for the first - team squad next season @entity42 was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this year , but could leave in the summer he wants to phase them in over four years but it would mean players , irrespective of nationality , will have to be with their club from 15 to qualify as homegrown ; the number of non-homegrown players in each 25 - man squad is to be reduced from 17 to 13 and at least two homegrown players must be club - trained			1
under those guidelines , @entity0 ’s @entity137 and @entity46 would no longer be classed as homegrown			2
‘ i think it is important for big teams to bring in the best players , that is the most important thing , ’ said @entity16			2
‘ i think about the academy we must be patient			0
this club built all these things because young players are important			0
‘ maybe it is not always easy for young players , especially in big teams , to play in the professional squad but i am sure in the future we will have important players to come from the academy and will be part of our squad			0
’ while that wait goes on , @entity0 have no option but to put trust in their chequebook .			0

@entity0 will make signing @entity7 players a *priority* this summer
@entity31 , @entity36 and @entity83 are all on @entity0 's wanted list
club chiefs want to sign young , hungry potentially world - class players
the @entity20 champions , however , will not compromise on quality
@entity16 has *admitted* it 's hard to sign the best @entity7 talent
city need eight homegrown players for their first - team squad next season
