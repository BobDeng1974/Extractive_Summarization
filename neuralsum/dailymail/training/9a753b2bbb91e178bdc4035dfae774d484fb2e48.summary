by @entity1 reporter published : 17:26 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 17:42 est , 28 january 2013 a former @entity3 congressman has backed out of smoking a ' marijuana cigarette ' , but his refusal is apparently due to familial pressures , not political ones			1
@entity8 made a public bet with film producer @entity10 that the two would share a joint if his home state of @entity14 legalized pot last election day			1
that historic measure passed and @entity8 said recently that he would hold his side of the bargain			2
but now he 's changed his mind , as his wife does n't agree			2
former @entity3 congressman @entity8 , center , spoke out in favor of marijuana legalization before the vote			1
but he 's not reneged on a deal to smoke some pot as his wife is ' p * * * * d ' ' my wife is absolutely - she 's p * * * * d , ' @entity8 told @entity32 on friday			1
' oh man , she is not happy			0
' he also cited concerns about his grandchildren , stating : ' i am especially concerned that the publicity may cause my grandkids to have to justify my actions to their peers and afraid that no matter how many times i say i am not condoning the use of marijuana , that that message will not get through			0
' @entity8 spoke out in favor of legalization before the vote and was interviewed by @entity10 for his film , grassroots - the comeback of cannabis			2
in the film , @entity10 suggested to the ex-congressman : ' when marijuana legalization passes and marijuana is legal , the next time i ’m out in @entity14 , we ’re going to smoke a joint together			1
' ' deal , ' said @entity8 , with the pair shaking on it			1
and even last week , @entity8 claimed that while he had never smoked pot and that he was n't condoning its use , he would honor the deal with ' just a puff			1
' ' look , i made a bet with the producer of the film that if @entity66 passed ( i did not think it would ) that i would smoke pot. i will therefore smoke pot under circumstances we both agree are legal under @entity14 law , ' @entity8 went on			1
a pro-legalization rally in @entity73 before the vote			0
ex-congressman @entity8 also supported @entity66 64 , but has never condoned its use but now he 's changed his tune			1
and it 's not just because he has to answer to his wife and grandkids			2
@entity8 has also revealed that his conservative associates also had their problems with his stunt			0
' my conservative friends just believe what i 'm doing is encouraging people to smoke it , ' @entity8 said			2
' i do n't think people should			0
that decision is up to an individual			0
an adult , in this society , is not something the government should have any control over			0
' @entity8 has had a controversial political career			0
in 2006 he described @entity96 as a ' third - world country ' and in 2007 he began a campaign for president by taking hard - line stances on the issues of illegal immigration and terrorism			0
at an event in 2010 , he described president @entity105 as the ' greatest threat to the @entity107 today ' because the president 's policies were undermining the ' @entity110 ' and ' our way of life			0
' @entity8 said he could n't go through on his bet to smoke pot as his wife ' was n't happy '			1

former @entity3 congressman @entity8 had *promised* to smoke marijuana if the drug was legalized in his home state of @entity14
he 's now reneging on the public deal as his wife is ' not happy '
