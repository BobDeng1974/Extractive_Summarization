by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:52 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 02:21 est , 17 april 2013 the @entity4 bombs were built inside pressure cookers and packed with shards of metal , nails and ball bearings , it emerged last night			1
the aim was to cause maximum carnage as red - hot shrapnel tore through spectators and runners			1
investigators believe the explosives – which killed three and injured more than 170 – were in six - litre pressure cookers with gunpowder and set off by an electronic timer			1
bloodied : injured runners and spectators lie on the pavement after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the @entity4 on monday investigators continue to comb the scene after the horrific attack in @entity28 it is believed the six - litre pressure cooker bombs were set off by an electronic timer the devices are used by terrorists in @entity34 , are a preferred weapon of @entity36 and listed as the ‘ most effective ’ weapon of jihad			1
details of the crude but effective devices emerged as president @entity42 told the @entity43 to be on the alert for anything suspicious and admitted it was still not known who was responsible			0
he said the @entity49 ’ day blasts were ‘ a heinous and cowardly act ’ of terror used to target innocent people and promised those responsible would feel the ‘ full weight of justice ’			1
but mr @entity42 also said it was unclear if the attacks were carried out by an international or domestic organisation , or perhaps by a ‘ malevolent individual			0
’ one of the bombs was placed in a black back - pack before being put on the ground among spectators , the other was left in a dustbin			1
one may have been triggered by a mobile telephone			0
the pressure cooker devices have been used in @entity34 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
at least one was employed in the attempted may 2010 bombing of @entity73 in @entity74 by @entity75 , who admitted he had undergone bomb - making training at a militant @entity79 faction camp in @entity70			0
however , the @entity70 @entity80 , which claimed responsibility for the 2010 attempt in @entity73 , has denied any role in the @entity28 attack			0
a man kneels praying in front of a makeshift memorial on @entity88 , @entity28 @entity4 runners embrace at the gates where three people died and more than 170 were injured in the bombing three people , including an eight - year - old boy , were killed and 176 injured , 17 critically , in the blasts near the finishing line of the showpiece event watched on tv by millions across the @entity43 on monday			1
yesterday @entity99 , of the @entity100 , said : ‘ we will go to the ends of the @entity103 to identify the subject or subjects who are responsible for this despicable crime			0
’ officers , who checked the course before the marathon started , now think the bomber had a ‘ three - hour window ’ to plant the devices before the blasts and are looking into a number of suspect groups and theories			2
the include the possibility of a fanatical right - winger or ‘ @entity119 ’			0
the crude , basic nature of the bombs are said to point towards this and the attack was launched on april 15 , tax day in the @entity43 , when the whole nation is expected to file tax returns			1
experts speculated right - wingers could have seen the marathon as a liberal , multicultural bonanza worthy of targeting			0
significantly , there has been a large rise in the number of anti-government or so - called ‘ @entity137 ’ groups during mr @entity42 ’s presidency			2
monday was @entity49 ’ day in the @entity43 , a public holiday commemorating the anniversary of the @entity144 in 1775 , the first battles of the @entity139 , which would be cause for celebration for such groups			1
the obvious alternative theory is a foreign terrorist group			0
@entity36 , the @entity80 and terrorists linked to the groups have been desperate to carry out a bombing on the @entity43 mainland , especially since @entity151 shot @entity152 dead in his @entity70 hideout			1
the devices have been used in @entity34 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 but no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack the @entity100 has applied for a warrant to extract the identity of every mobile telephone in the area where the bombings took place but their efforts have been repeatedly foiled and monday ’s attacks are not thought to be the work of suicide bombers			1
@entity36 and their associates are usually swift to claim responsibility for their attacks but last night no group had come forward			2
yesterday the full extent of the horrific injuries suffered by the victims became clear as dr @entity175 , of @entity176 , said his doctors removed ‘ a variety of sharp objects , ’ including pellets and nails , from the wounds of victims – one had 40 pellets in a leg			0
his colleague , dr @entity187 , disclosed an x-ray of one victim ’s leg that had ‘ what appears to be small , uniform , round objects throughout it – similar in the appearance to ball bearings ’			0
the @entity100 has applied for a warrant to extract the identity of every mobile telephone in the area where the bombings took place and has requested that all spectators hand over any phone or camera footage to help try to identify any suspects			0
last night police said that no one was under arrest but refused to provide any insight into a raid on a residential building in @entity212 , eight miles north - east of @entity28 , late on monday – said to be the home of a @entity215 man			0
president @entity42 told the @entity43 to be alert for anything suspicious and admitted it is still not known who was responsible for the @entity28 bombing several large bags were taken from a fifth - floor apartment early yesterday			2
police , who confirmed explosives experts had accompanied them in the search , which was done ‘ under warrant ’ , were earlier said to have questioned two men from @entity215			0
the leader of the 9/11 attacks and several members of the cells that hijacked four planes were from @entity215 , but officials ‘ cautioned ’ against putting ‘ great significance ’ on the raids ‘ at this stage ’			0
a 20 year - old student linked to the address is said to be under police guard in hospital , where he is being treated for burns and shrapnel wounds to his legs , after he was tackled to the ground by a civilian who believed he was acting suspiciously			2
at @entity28 ’s @entity248 , investigators seized the man ’s clothes to examine whether they held any evidence that he was linked to the attack			0
law sources told the @entity254 that after the man was grabbed by police , he smelled of gunpowder and said , ‘ i thought there would be a second bomb ’ , before asking , ‘ did anyone die ? ’ by @entity261 the @entity4 attacks will go down in history as yet another atrocity associated with @entity49 ’ day			1
investigators fear the timing of the bomb blasts on a day full of significance for many @entity43 is no coincidence			2
the celebration of freedom marks the anniversary of the first battles of the @entity274 in 1775 – the ‘ shot heard around the world ’			0
but its meaning has been warped by a growing number of white supremacists and other far - right groups who have turned it into a rallying point			1
the @entity28 bombings join a litany of other terrible events connected to the day , including : @entity49 ’ day is april 19 , but in @entity288 and @entity289 it is commemorated with a public holiday on the third monday in april			1
on monday night , president @entity42 noted the date , saying : ‘ today is @entity49 ’ day – a day that reflects the freedom @entity28 has celebrated throughout its history			1
’ counter-terrorism expert @entity295 said the incident had hints of a right - wing attack rather than @entity36 - inspired extremism			2
mr @entity295 said the timing on @entity49 ’ day and the relatively small size of the devices suggested the work of a domestic extremist .			1
