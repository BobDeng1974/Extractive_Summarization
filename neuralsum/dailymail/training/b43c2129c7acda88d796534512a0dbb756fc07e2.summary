recommendations : the report was put together by former civil servant sir @entity2 , pictured gay couples should be allowed to have their relationships blessed in church , the @entity3 said yesterday			1
bishops should lift their official ban on ceremonies to mark civil partnerships and the relationships of gay and lesbian churchgoers , a long - awaited @entity7 said			1
it signalled an end to the @entity3 ’s longstanding insistence that gay relationships are sinful and less worthy than heterosexual marriage			1
the report , written by former civil servant sir @entity21 and a team of senior churchmen and women , may now open the way for a reversal of the @entity3 ’s opposition to same - sex marriage and the eventual appointment of actively homosexual priests and bishops			1
it was published seven months after the @entity3 first indicated it is looking at ‘ accommodations ’ for same - sex couples and four months after the archbishop of @entity36 , the most reverend @entity37 , told @entity3 leaders that ‘ we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality			1
’ archbishop @entity37 said yesterday that bishops will now ‘ consider the report and decide how such a process might best be shaped			2
’ in its key paragraph the @entity48 report declared : ‘ we believe there can be circumstances where a priest , with the agreement of the parish , should be free to mark the formation of a permanent same - sex relationship in a public service but should be under no obligation to do so			0
’ acknowledging arguments among the report team , it added : ‘ some of us do not believe that this can be extended to same - sex marriage			0
’ current @entity3 guidance laid down by bishops forbids priests to conduct same - sex blessing services			1
nevertheless , some estimates say 200 such services a year are carried out in @entity3 churches			2
bishops could permit gay blessing services simply by changing their guidelines			2
their first opportunity to do so will come at meetings next month and in january			0
the @entity48 report calls for two years of ‘ facilitated conversations ’ on a series of ideas that will sweep away the decades of opposition to gay rights if a majority in the @entity3 accept them			1
such talks may prove ‘ difficult and divisive ’ a statement by @entity37 admitted			0
it called for the talks to end the rule dating from 1991 that says gays are welcome in the pews but that clergy must not be actively homosexual			1
‘ the @entity3 ’s present rules impose different disciplines on clergy and laity in relations to sexually active same - sex relationships , ’ the report said			1
‘ it will be important to reflect on the extent to which laity and clergy should continue to observe such different disciplines			0
’ the report suggested that reforms might go ahead through bringing in different rules for junior clergy and for bishops - rules similar to those which currently allow women priests but not women bishops			1
the row over gay bishops has been toxic for the @entity112 since the last archbishop of @entity36 , lord @entity114 , prevented the appointment of openly gay @entity116 as a bishop in 2003			2
dr @entity116 is now @entity118			0
under consideration : the archbishop of @entity36 , @entity37 , said the @entity3 will now consider the recommendations in a series of calls for new thinking , the report said the @entity3 should show ‘ real repentance for the lack of welcome and acceptance extended to homosexual people in the past ’			1
however , it added : ‘ no - one should be accused of homophobia solely for articulating traditional @entity135 teaching on same - sex relationships			0
’ the report suggested that the @entity138 does not condemn homosexuality and said no - one should teach that it does			0
it also warned that liberal attitudes to homosexuality in western countries can cause trouble in countries where @entity135 are vulnerable to attack			0
congregations in countries like @entity150 and @entity151 , where homosexuality is universally condemned by @entity152 , have been subjected to violence in recent years			0
the report said : ‘ it is important , for some a matter of life and death , that the @entity3 and church people speak with great care and attentiveness to how their words will be received , not only in their own culture but in cultures where @entity135 are marginalised			1
’ the @entity3 set itself against the gay rights agenda in 1987 , at a time when pressure for recognition of gay relationships by @entity112 was just beginning			1
its parliament , the @entity171 , said then that gay sex was sinful			2
last year the @entity3 strongly opposed @entity174 ’s same - sex marriage legislation , saying it would wreck traditional marriage and undermine families			2
the @entity48 report said that there should be no formal liturgy for same - sex blessing services , but consenting priests and parishes should be allowed to work out their own form of service			0
it hinted strongly that full acceptance of same - sex marriage is on the way			0
‘ a willingness to offer public recognition and prayer for a committed same - sex relationship would , in practice , be hard to implement now for civil partnerships without also doing so for same - sex marriage , ’ it said			0
one member of the report team , the @entity195 , the right reverend @entity196 , said he was unable to accept the recommendations .			0
