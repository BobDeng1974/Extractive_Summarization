by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:40 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 16:59 est , 13 march 2014 @entity3 is set to order the @entity1 @entity4 to tighten regulations that allow some companies to skirt overtime laws by declaring employees ' jobs are ' executive ' or ' professional ' in nature			1
the president will do it by raising the earning threshold that salaried workers must reach before they can be asked to work longer hours without time - and - a - half compensation			1
it has been ten years since president @entity17 last raised that threshold , from $ 250 per week to $ 455			1
but the increase failed to keep up with inflation , making the smaller number worth more in today 's dollars than the larger one			1
and any move to adjust it upward again could cost jobs as employers scramble to write bigger paychecks with the same amount of money in human - resources budgets			2
' as a result , millions of salaried workers have been left without the protections of overtime or sometimes even the minimum wage			0
for example , a convenience store manager or a fast food shift supervisor or an office worker may be expected to work 50 or 60 hours a week or more , making barely enough to keep a family out of poverty , and not receive a dime of overtime pay			1
' by shifting the overtime minimum - earning goalposts again , @entity65 hope to identify another pocketbook issue that will encourage middle - class workers to vote for them in november			2
it also indicates that the @entity45 is prepared to sacrifice long - term jobs in order to appease the remaining employed low - income voting bloc in the short term			2
that 's because employers who must suddenly pay overtime rates for many employees will still have to work within the restrictions of their human resources budgets			2
one way to work around the problem will be for companies to lay off workers who earn more than the new threshold and replace them with lower - paid , lower - skilled employees			0
another way might be to dismiss some workers and slow down future hiring increases so that capital can catch up with costs			0
in order for the @entity3 administration to increase the threshold to what a $ 250 weekly paycheck was worth in 1975 , it would have to set the new minimum to $ 1,122.58 – a $ 28 - per - hour rate equal to an annual salary of $ 58,374			1
the liberal @entity102 has proposed an increase to $ 984 a week , about 50,000 per year			0
that number would increase take - home pay for between 5 and 10 million people			0
labor secretary @entity107 ( far @entity108 ) , who will be in charge of setting the new overtime - wage qualification threshold , has been part of @entity3 's speaking tour to push a nationwide minimum - wage hike but it 's unlikely the new bar will be set that high when the @entity4 issues draft regulations			1
@entity3 's move , expected thursday , will merely start the process			0
@entity120 's and @entity37 's governments recently re-set their thresholds at $ 640 and $ 600 per week , respectively			0
' we need to fix the system so folks working hard are getting compensated fairly , ' @entity122 , the @entity123 director , told @entity127			1
' that ’s why we are jump - starting this effort			0
' but @entity131 senior fellow @entity130 countered that ' [ t ] here ’s no such thing as a free lunch			2
' ' if they push through something to make a certain class of workers more expensive , something will happen to adjust			0

the president will order the @entity4 to increase the salary threshold below which companies must pay workers extra for overtime
the bar was last raised in 2004 during the @entity17 administration , but has *lagged* far behind inflation
if the @entity45 restored the level to what it was worth in 1975 , everyone earning less than $ 58,000 per year would qualify for overtime pay
' there 's no free lunch , ' one *analyst* told the @entity127 , *warning* that employers could cut some jobs to pay for the rising cost of others
