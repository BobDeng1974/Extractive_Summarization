@entity0 claims to be the world 's leading animal rights charity - but this shocking picture of garbage bags filled with dead cats has led to claims that the group is actually abusing animals rather than helping them			1
the photograph shows the interior of a dumpster outside a @entity13 supermarket , which reportedly contains a pile of garbage bags each filled with the dead cats			0
the picture is one of many photos that @entity18 claims depict rampant animal abuse at the organization that took the felines in with the promise of finding them homes			1
bloodshed : piles of garbage bags containing dead cats are pictured outside @entity0 's @entity28 headquarters the photo was taken in 2007 , when two @entity0 employees were charged with animal cruelty in connection to the dead cats , according to the @entity33			2
veterinarians testified in the case that the cats found in the bags were found to be healthy before their deaths			0
in another photo provided by mr @entity18 , a ' pet - killing kit ' that was found in the back of a @entity0 van is seen			1
mr @entity18 , the director of the @entity43 , says that images such as this exhibit the horrific reality of pets that enter @entity0 's doors - and do n't make it out			1
he claims that @entity0 has killed more than 29,426 animals in the last 11 years			1
@entity18 branded the animal rights group ' little more than a slaughterhouse ' in a february blog post			2
saddening : more than 1,0000 cats were euthanized by @entity0 last year , according to statistics from the @entity55 for @entity56 and @entity57 in an emailed statement , @entity0 spokesman @entity58 said : ' anyone who is shocked to learn how many animals have to be euthanized annually in the @entity62 should ask themselves if they 're spaying and neutering their own companion animals , adopting from shelters instead of buying from breeders and pet stores and demanding higher animal - care standards in their own communities			1
and more importantly , they should look at the photos of animals @entity0 @entity62 served in the impoverished areas in the vicinity of its headquarters in @entity28			1
' mr @entity58 added that the euthanasia figures are distorted , and do not include the almost 10,000 dogs and cats @entity0 provided with no - cost to low - cost sterilization services , the number of animals delivered to large high - traffic facilities for adoption , as well as counseling and preventive services			1
the organization has released a video of its own that examines the danger of no - kill shelters , which @entity58 says turn away animals due to overcrowding			0
watch video here euthanasia : this ' pet killing kit ' was found by police officers in the back of a @entity0 van , according to @entity18 @entity0 told @entity101 last month that the animals they take in at the center are ' unadoptable			1
' in figures from the @entity107 last month , it was revealed that @entity0 killed nearly 90 per cent of dogs and cats placed in the care of the shelter at its headquarters last year			1
the charity , well - known for attention grabbing publicity campaigns such as the ' i 'd rather go naked ' anti-fur campaign , euthanized 1,647 cats and dogs last year and only placed 19 in new homes according to data submitted to the @entity122			0
however , the figure that 89.4 per cent of euthanized animals is much higher than their own approximation that half of pets taken to shelters end up being killed			2
according to the statistics 1,110 cats and 733 dogs were handed in to the charity in 2012			0
22 cats and 108 dogs were transferred to another shelter , two cats and three dogs were reclaimed by their owner while 1,045 cats and 602 dogs were euthanized			0
criticism : @entity0 , well - known for its hard - hitting adverts such as the one pictured , has come under fire for the number of animals it kills at its shelter in @entity149 , @entity28 defense : the charity says euthanasia at its @entity154 shelter , pictured , is a ' necessary evil ' as aside from those suffering they ca n't find homes for all the cats and dogs handed to them 34 cats and 7 dogs were placed under a category entitled ' miscellaneous			1
' the statistics have been promoted by a restaurant advocacy coalition called @entity165 , which has had numerous run - ins with the charity in the past			0
@entity170 , @entity165 's senior research analyst said : ' the animal rights group is talking out of both sides of its mouth – on one side preaching its animal liberation agenda , while on the other signing the death warrant of over 89 percent of pets in its care			0
' ' it seems @entity0 is more dedicated to publicity stunts than to keeping the animals in its own care alive			1
it ’s the height of hypocrisy for @entity0 to demonstrate for the ' rights ' of rats and pigs , while killing tens of thousands of pets			2
it ’s time that the @entity191 of @entity28 finally reclassifies @entity0 ’s pet shelter for what it is – a slaughterhouse			2
' a @entity0 spokeswoman told @entity101 that they had no choice but to euthanize the animals			1
well - known campaigns : the charity often uses celebrities for its hard - hitting campaigns			0
it was accused today of being more interested in ' publicity stunts than keeping animals alive ' campaigns : among its many projects @entity0 encourages vegetarianism and veganism and is against animal testing ' we have a small division that does hands - on work with animals , and most of the animals we take in are society 's rejects ; aggressive , on death 's door , or somehow unadoptable , ' she said			1
' @entity165 's goal is to damage @entity0 by misrepresenting the situation and the number of unwanted and suffering animals @entity0 euthanizes because of injury , illness , age , aggression , and other problems , because their guardians requested it , or because no good homes exist for them			2
' a later statement added : ' @entity0 refers adoptable animals to the high - traffic open - admission shelters where they have the best chance of being seen and finding a new home			2
' in a 2009 blog the charity wrote about their opposition to ' no - kill ' animal shelters saying they often get filled and just have to turn animals away			0
it said in some cases euthanasia is a necessary evil and @entity0 is willing to do ' society 's dirty work			2
' sex sells : @entity0 often uses models in their campaigns			0
they hit out at critics of euthanasia at their cat and dog shelters yesterday saying it received many unadoptable pets ' as long as animals are still purposely bred and people are n't spaying and neutering their companions , open - admission animal shelters and organizations like @entity0 must do society 's dirty work			1
euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis , ' it said			0
in response to the post , supporters of the charity were torn on the issue but many said a charity in its position on issues such as medical testing , the fur trade and as advocates for veganism should never allow the killing of healthy animals over a lack of suitable home			0
' in my book , the only time it 's acceptable to kill animals is the same as the only time it 's acceptable to kill people : when their illness is painful and terminal			0
' ' anything else is a speciesist double standard			0
as soon as i hear of a campaign to kill homeless people because it 's ' more humane ' then i might consider it an acceptable option for homeless animals too , ' said one post .			0

@entity18 , the director of the @entity43 , claims that @entity0 has killed nearly *30,000* animals in the last 11 years
@entity0 says euthanasia figures are ' distorted , ' and do not include the nearly 10,000 animals saved and put up for adoption
