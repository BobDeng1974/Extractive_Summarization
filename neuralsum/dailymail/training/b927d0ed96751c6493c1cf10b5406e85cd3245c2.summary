by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has claimed that former @entity4 team - mate @entity3 may be past his best and says @entity5 must show the strength to drop him if he performs poorly at another @entity7			1
the @entity9 legend believes that @entity3 , 28 , must live up to expectations in @entity11 if he wants to be considered as one of the world ’s top players after failing to score in the last two tournaments in @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity2 , who was on @entity4 ’s coaching staff for the final four games of the season , also claimed that @entity3 does not work as well in a strike partnership and that could mean @entity23 has to choose between him and @entity24 next season			1
‘ he ’s got a brilliant scoring record for his country with 38 goals in 89 internationals , but he ’s played in eight @entity7 games without a goal			0
you expect more of him			0
if @entity3 is going to be one of the best footballers in the world , this @entity7 is where he has to produce			1
‘ maybe @entity3 has felt the pressure of playing for @entity5 in the last two @entity43 when he ’s not scored			1
i know how difficult it can be			0
@entity3 ’s peak may have been a lot younger than we ’d expect of footballers traditionally			1
‘ @entity49 or 29 has been the normal peak			0
with @entity3 , it could have been when he scored 27 league goals in 2011 - 2012 when he was 26			1
‘ @entity3 was in the @entity53 team at 16 years of age , in 2003			1
since then he ’s played at @entity55 , two @entity43 , the @entity56 , and @entity57 every year			1
there ’s a chance he ’s worn out			0
remember the name : @entity3 ( left ) made his debut for boyhood club @entity53 at the age of 16 in 2002 ‘ i ’m not saying @entity3 needs to be dropped , but if his form does n’t get up to scratch in the warm - ups , or in the first game of the @entity7 , it will be interesting to see if the @entity5 management team has the balls to make that decision			1
‘ we have quality forwards in the squad this time			0
that should give @entity3 the competition he needs to spur him on a little more			1
’ @entity2 believes @entity3 needs to conserve his energy and focus on scoring goals if he is going to be most effective in @entity11			1
coaches : @entity2 was part of the @entity4 interim management team with @entity82 and @entity83 he added : ‘ to get the very best from @entity3 , the manager needs to tell him , “ do n’t bother running back			1
that ’s your job in my team ”			2
‘ @entity3 ’s almost like a schoolkid			2
he loves being a footballer			0
@entity3 wants all the responsibility to score			2
he ’ll try to play left back , right back			0
sometimes he does that too much instead of saving himself and his energy for what his teams need — the ball in the net			0
he needs to use his energy more effectively now as he ’s a player who likes to be up front on his own and i do n’t think he ’s great with partnerships			0
‘ it ’ll be interesting next season with @entity23 and how he decides to play @entity106			2
it looks like it might come to a straight choice between @entity3 and @entity110			2
’ tucked away : @entity3 ( left ) scored 17 league goals this season for @entity4 as the club finished seventh in his blog for @entity115 , @entity2 also admitted he is unlikely to be involved in @entity117 ’s backroom team , and warned @entity4 executive vice-chairman @entity118 he still needs to convince people that he is good enough for the job			1
he added : ‘ i ’ve not spoken to @entity118			0
i ’m not waiting for a phone call and do n’t expect to be at @entity9 next season			2
‘ @entity23 has the credentials but he has a major job on his hands			2
@entity4 need five or six players to get anywhere near the top of the @entity56 again			1
straight to the point : @entity129 manager @entity23 ( left ) speaks with @entity24 on thursday ‘ the players did not perform last season			1
@entity132 was a little negative with the teams he put out and he took a lot of stick , but i believe he ’s a top manager			2
i ’d question if 10 months was enough time			0
‘ @entity118 has an awful lot to prove this time that he ’s good enough at his job			0
he has to bring the players in that the new manager wants			0
it ’s obvious that last year he did n’t manage to do that			0
‘ if he does n’t , we are not going to get anywhere near the top			0
