by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 27 april 2013 updated : 10:52 est , 27 april 2013 the @entity1 has carried out unmanned drone missions against the @entity3 from @entity5 soil for the first time			2
in an escalation of the war in @entity11 , raids on extremists were flown by @entity12 , operating out of @entity13 in @entity14			1
the hi - tech reaper drones are primarily used to gather intelligence on enemy activity on the ground , but they also carry 500lb bombs and hellfire missiles for precision strikes on insurgents			1
controversy : @entity1 crews controlling armed @entity26 drones in @entity11 are doing so from @entity5 soil for the first time , the @entity28 has confirmed until this week , @entity1 crews who control armed drones in @entity11 have been operating from the @entity32 in @entity33			1
an @entity28 spokesman said they had been carrying out missions including intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , but would not comment on exactly what individual missions had been flown in the past week by drones piloted from the @entity5			0
the pilots in @entity14 are operating with @entity5 and @entity45 colleagues still based in @entity33 - but having drone operators in a different time zone makes it easier to coordinate shift patterns and conduct 24 hour operations			1
the @entity5 currently has five reaper unmanned aerial vehicles but prime minister @entity52 confirmed in 2010 that the fleet of @entity26 aircraft would expand			0
the @entity26 is the more powerful version of the lethal @entity56 , a 27ft long drone armed with hellfire missiles and equipped with an infrared camera capable of identifying a human on the ground from 10,000ft in the air			1
drones : @entity1 - controlled @entity26 drones are used to gather intelligence on the ground in @entity11 , but also carry 500lb bombs and hellfire missiles for precision strikes ( file photo ) last year the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) announced that the @entity5 was doubling the number of armed @entity1 drones in @entity11 to 10			1
delivery of the new aircraft is expected this summer			0
the move is controversial since @entity45 drone strikes are blamed for killing innocent civilians			2
the @entity28 will only confirm one incident of civilian casualties involving @entity5 aircraft , when innocent people were killed by the blast of a missile that also killed two insurgents			0
an @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ @entity12 have commenced supporting @entity86 and @entity11 ground troops in @entity11 with armed intelligence and surveillance missions , which are remotely piloted from @entity13			1
’ anti-war protestors are set to gather outside the base today to call for a ban on the ' killer ' drones , claiming the government is using them to ' fight wars behind our backs '			1
members of the @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity102 and @entity103 marched to @entity13 from @entity104 today to protest against the drones			1
the organisers of the protest march and rally are calling on the government to abandon the use of drones , claiming they make it easier for politicians to launch military interventions , and have increased civilian casualties			0
around 400 demonstrators took part today 's march to the base , which assumed control of @entity5 drone missions in @entity11 earlier this week			1
the protesters cheered calls for the international community to emulate action taken against cluster munitions by outlawing armed drones			0
' killer ' drones : the use of drones like the lethal @entity56 - which is loaded with hellfire anti-tank missiles - has been condemned by anti-war campaigners protest : hundreds of protestors marched on the base in @entity14 today to voice their opposition to the lethal drones ' ground the drones ' : protestors said the use of the drones raised serious moral , ethical and legal questions @entity138 , a co-ordinator of the @entity102 , said the use of @entity140 ( @entity140 ) to wage war raised numerous legal , ethical and moral issues			1
speaking near @entity13 's perimeter fence , mr @entity138 said : ' this is the new home of drone warfare in the @entity5 and there are questions about the growing use of these armed , unmanned systems			0
' because of their remote nature , there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in warfare , ' he added			0
commenting ahead of the protest , @entity103 senior campaigns officer @entity162 said : ' drones , controlled far away from conflict zones , ease politicians ' decisions to launch military strikes and order extrajudicial assassinations , without democratic oversight or accountability to the public			2
' now is the time to ban killer drones - before it is too late			1
' @entity175 , vice-chairman of the @entity100 , claimed drones were being used to continue the ' deeply unpopular @entity177 ' with no public scrutiny			0
conflict : the @entity5 and the @entity45 are operating unmanned drones in the skies over @entity11 calling for armed drones to be banned , mr @entity175 said : ' they 're using them to fight wars behind our backs			1
' the @entity28 has defended its use of drones in @entity11 , which it says have saved the lives of countless military personnel and civilians			2
an @entity28 spokesman said : ' @entity26 aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned @entity1 aircraft			0
' @entity200 held talks with the organisers of the protest to minimise disruption to the local community			0
the route of the march from @entity208 along the @entity209 to the peace camp site opposite @entity13 saw the road closed in phases to limit inconvenience to motorists			0
its new role in the war on terror is not the first time @entity13 has been at the heart of @entity5 's fight against foreign enemies			0
squadrons flew out from @entity13 on the first day of the @entity224 , and more than 40 years later the base would provide the @entity227 aircraft that bombed @entity228 during the @entity230 conflict			1
today , @entity1 personnel based at @entity13 are controlling unmanned drones in the skies above @entity11 in a bid to gather intelligence on enemy insurgents			1
historic : a squadron lines up in front of an @entity227 bomber at @entity13 in 1982 over the decades the rural base has housed aircraft that played a crucial role in @entity5 military operations ; from the @entity245 to the v - bomber nuclear strike force			1
@entity13 first opened in november 1916 as a flying training station , teaching hundreds of @entity5 and @entity249 pilots to fly in a wide range of aircraft			0
four years later the station was designated for care and maintenance , until a major @entity1 expansion began in 1934			0
that expansion saw the construction of some hangars which remain in use to this day			0
in march 1937 @entity13 was re-opened as a bomber base , and became the home of squadrons flying the light bomber aircraft the @entity245 , which was later replaced by twin - engine @entity264 bombers			2
@entity266 : @entity13 was home to the @entity245 , a light bomber aircraft used extensively in the early days of the @entity224 in 1939 both @entity13 squadrons ; 44 and 50 , were in action on the first day of @entity224 , attempting to bomb the @entity271 at @entity272			0
during the @entity274 , @entity13 's @entity264 aircraft bombed @entity276 invasion barges anchored in @entity278 ports			0
the @entity279 were eventually replaced by @entity280 , before the superior @entity281 entered @entity1 service for the first time with @entity284 at @entity13 in 1941			2
it was with this unit that squadron leader @entity287 earned the @entity288 in june 1942 , after heading up an attack on a @entity276 u-boat engine factory			0
@entity13 saw further modernisation in 1943 with the introduction of concrete runways , after which two @entity295 @entity281 squadrons took up residence at the base			2
the final @entity224 raid from @entity13 - which targeted an oil refinery at @entity300 in @entity301 - took place in april 1945 , just months before the war came to an end			2
@entity305 : today @entity13 is home to six badged @entity1 squadrons , members of which are seen being greeted by the deputy prime minister following their return from a mission in @entity312 in 2011 in the years that followed @entity13 hosted a range of @entity281 and @entity104 squadrons , before being put into maintenance once again in 1953 to prepare the base for the v - bomber - the aircraft that comprised the @entity5 's strategic nuclear strike force during the ' 50s and ' 60s			1
the v - bomber class included the famous @entity227 - the @entity1 's jet - powered delta wing aircraft			2
by 1961 @entity13 housed three squadrons of @entity328 , and the aircraft would remain a fixture at the base until march 1984 , its planned retirement having been postponed as a result of the @entity230 conflict			2
once again the @entity104 base was at the heart of the @entity5 's military strategy ; providing the @entity328 that bombed @entity228 and also those hastily modified for air - to - air refuelling duties .			1
