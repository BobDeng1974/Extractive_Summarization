by @entity0 published : 18:10 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 11:24 est , 18 september 2013 @entity1 yesterday attacked the @entity2 ¿ proposed tax breaks for married couples @entity1 yesterday attacked the @entity2 ’ proposed tax breaks for married couples as an ‘ insult ’			0
the business secretary said the long - promised move by the @entity10 would unfairly penalise widows and those whose spouses had left them			0
the assault by the senior @entity15 came after it emerged that party leader @entity16 has agreed a deal with @entity18 to ensure it becomes law			1
sources say the deputy prime minister will order his mps to abstain on any vote on the issue and is threatening to sack any ministers who break ranks			1
it is thought that mr @entity16 has agreed not to oppose the measure in return for a £ 600million commitment to extend free school meals to children aged between five and seven			1
but mr @entity1 yesterday denounced the proposed flagship @entity10 policy , under which one spouse would be allowed to transfer £ 750 of their tax - free personal allowance to their partner			1
‘ i ’m a great believer in marriage , and i ’m in favour of encouraging stable marriage , ’ he said			0
‘ but this is not the way to do it			0
‘ it ’s going to create massive unfairness			0
people who have been abandoned by their partners will be penalised			0
‘ people in good , stable marriages are going to be insulted at the idea that a few hundred quid a year is going to keep their marriage together			0
’ the measure would particularly favour those partnerships where someone stays at home and will also be extended to gay couples in civil partnerships or – once the law changes next year – marriages			2
the assault by the senior @entity15 came after it emerged that party leader @entity16 has agreed a deal with @entity18 to ensure it becomes law @entity68 has already said it will oppose the recognition of marriage in the tax system , opening up a key election dividing line			1
the proposed policy can now only pass into law if the @entity15 stick to a previous agreement to abstain in any future commons vote on the issue			1
mr @entity16 will today tell the @entity15 conference in @entity79 that the party had committed not to vote against the measure as part of a @entity84 deal			1
‘ the conservatives are very attached to the idea of a so - called married tax break , and they put it in the coalition agreement and we committed not to vote against it , ’ he will say			2
‘ but i do n’t support it because i do n’t understand what is remotely fair about telling an unmarried taxpayer , “ you are going to have to pay higher taxes to help your neighbour just because they got married to get lower taxes ”			0
mr @entity16 will today tell the @entity15 conference in @entity79 that the party had committed not to vote against the measure as part of a @entity84 deal the conservatives want to single out certain families , we want to help all families with young children			1
’ a source close to the deputy prime minister insisted that all @entity15 mps would be expected to abstain on the issue			1
‘ they want to spend whatever it is on the marriage tax allowance , we want to spend it on free school meals for all young children , ’ the source said			1
‘ it ’s a straight up and down deal			2
we will be sticking to the coalition agreement and abstaining when marriage tax comes forward and we will expect our mps to do that			2
’ ministers or mps who refuse to comply and vote against the measure can expect to be dismissed , the source indicated			1
mr @entity1 is planning to abstain , but his attack on the idea of a transferable tax allowance may encourage other potential rebels			2
the measure has been brought forward on the agenda and chancellor @entity134 now plans to include it in his @entity137 statement			2
he has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women , leading to calls to support for stay - at - home mothers with a transferable tax allowance			0
the @entity84 ’s previous focus was to raise the personal income tax allowance threshold to £ 10,000			0
but a report unveiled at the @entity15 conference by @entity147 last night called it a ‘ terribly inefficient ’ way of helping poorer families as it ‘ ignores @entity152 ’s lack of regard for family responsibility ’			0
it called for a generous transferable allowance for married couples .			0

assault comes after it emerged @entity16 has agreed a deal with @entity18 to ensure it becomes law
sources say deputy *pm* will order mps to abstain from a vote on the issue
it is believed mr @entity16 has agreed not to oppose the measure in return to a £ 600million commitment to extend free school meals
