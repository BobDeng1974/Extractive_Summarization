by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 22 april 2013 are @entity1 right to stand by @entity2 ? @entity2 is facing a ban that is set to run into next season after the @entity1 striker was charged by the @entity6 for his outrageous bite on @entity8			1
the @entity1 striker was charged with violent conduct at the end a dramatic day during which @entity12 campaigner @entity11 admitted she was torn over the gesture by @entity2 of donating his fine to the families of the 96 victims			1
@entity2 , who was fined an undisclosed amount by @entity1 yesterday , will discover his fate tomorrow when a three - man @entity20 sits to hear his case			1
nobody from @entity1 or the @entity6 will be present			2
scroll down to watch video footage of the incident and @entity27 's interview stunned : @entity8 could n't believe @entity28 had attempted to bite him on the arm the @entity6 felt a mandatory three - match ban would not be sufficient punishment for this offence and it is likely he will receive a suspension similar to the seven games he served during his time at @entity38 , when he bit @entity40 ’s @entity39			1
@entity2 has accepted his financial punishment from @entity1 and asked for the money — thought to be more than £ 200,000 — to be donated to the @entity43 for the ‘ inconvenience i have created to the @entity1 fans and @entity8 ’			1
while acknowledging @entity2 was attempting to do the right thing , @entity11 — the chairwoman of the @entity43 , whose fight for justice has been characterised by respect and dignity — admitted the incident during sunday ’s 2 - 2 draw was ‘ awful ’			1
‘ i would rather not be accepting the fine from @entity2 because i would rather he had not bitten that player , ’ said @entity11 , who stressed she did not consider turning down the donation			1
‘ it is a nice gesture but it is a terrible thing under the circumstances			0
speaking out : prime minister @entity59 said the @entity6 need to take a hard line disbelief : the @entity62 defender did n't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by @entity2 yesterday ‘ we ca n’t say we are grateful because we would rather him not have done that at all			1
it is an awful thing at any time — not just this particular week			0
it is nice to know he knows he has let himself , the club , the fans and the ( @entity12 ) families down			0
‘ we could refuse to accept it but it is going to have to go to someone , and he wants to show respect and remorse to the families			0
’ @entity2 has been genuinely contrite following the latest disgraceful episode of his career and the @entity82 , who said it would be ‘ embarrassing ’ if he were named @entity84 next sunday , have offered to help with improving his behaviour			1
he will receive the same help at @entity87			0
@entity1 employ top psychologist dr @entity88 , who is credited with playing an instrumental role in transforming the fortunes of @entity92 cycling			0
@entity94 @entity1 's managing director on @entity2 controversy @entity1 managing director @entity27 insisted @entity2 would not be sold			2
the @entity96 international has been warned , though , that there will be no way back should he step out of line again			0
in an interview on the club ’s television station , @entity27 said : ‘ it affects his future in the sense that we have to work with him on his discipline			0
but @entity2 is a very important player to the club			1
he ’s a very popular player with his team - mates			0
‘ as we keep saying , he signed a new four - year contract last summer and we ’d all love to see him here throughout that contract			0
he ’s a fantastic player , top scorer and everything we ’d want in a striker , so there ’s no change there			0
‘ this is more about getting him back on the right track and it ’s largely down to @entity122 ( @entity123 ) now to work with him on that side of his character			0
the most important thing is that we acted swiftly			0
out and about : a sombre - looking @entity2 is pictured in @entity1 on monday morning ‘ @entity2 issued his apology and then we spoke with him last night and then again this morning			1
we ’ve taken action to fine @entity2 for his actions			1
’ @entity1 , however , have received criticism for not issuing their own suspension and for leaving it to the @entity6 to deal with the incident			2
yet some @entity1 fans will believe that for @entity2 to face such a big ban is unjust , given what happened to @entity138 ’s @entity137 in 2006 when he bit @entity139			2
since that incident , though , the @entity6 have completely changed their rule book and had that incident occurred now , @entity137 — who was booked during that game against @entity141 — would have been charged again , given the exceptional circumstances			1
there has been no hiding place for @entity2 in the last 24 hours and his personal sponsors , adidas , issued a strongly worded statement to condemn an incident that has left the game stunned			2
confrontation : the @entity62 star made no secret of his unhappiness over the incident with the @entity1 man asked what action @entity59 thought should be taken against @entity2 , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' it is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider			1
' as part of their consideration , i think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high - profile players are often role models			2
' it read : ‘ adidas takes this type of incident very seriously and does not condone @entity2 ’s behaviour			1
we will be reminding him of the standards we expect from our players			0
‘ @entity2 has admitted his actions were unacceptable and we support the way @entity1 are planning to handle the situation			2
’ @entity1 ’s sponsors , @entity181 , also issued a statement , saying : ‘ @entity183 have clearly stated that this is unacceptable behaviour and @entity2 has apologised for the incident			1
we feel the club has dealt with this issue appropriately and swiftly			0
’ such has been the rumpus that even @entity188 became involved , with the prime minister ’s official spokesman saying : ‘ it is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider			1
look , ref : @entity8 shows his arm to referee @entity194 following the biting incident at @entity87 yesterday ‘ as part of their consideration , i think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high - profile players are often role models			1
’ players ’ union boss @entity208 added : ‘ i think we have to work on the positive side of things			0
we ’ve got a lad here who is an extremely good player , one of the world ’s best , and he is letting himself , the club and the game down by his actions			0
the @entity82 chief executive added : ‘ while it ’s good he made a personal apology , we have got to work really hard with him and i hope the club agree on this anger management business to avoid it happening again and setting the worst possible example			1
’ previous : @entity2 bites @entity39 of @entity40 while playing for @entity38 repeat ? the @entity40 star was as perplexed as @entity8 by @entity2 's behaviour @entity1 forward @entity2 is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite @entity62 defender @entity8 on the arm during the 2 - 2 draw with @entity62 at @entity87 , going on to score a late equaliser			1
