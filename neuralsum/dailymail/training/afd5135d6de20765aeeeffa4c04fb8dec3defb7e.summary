by @entity0 a high - tech centre in @entity2 is giving specialist prosthetic treatment to military amputees			1
the app - controlled @entity6 hand is pictured gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics			1
from 3d - printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps , advances in technology are revolutionising the industry			1
now , a new state - of - the - art centre has opened in @entity2 to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments , and making the technology more mainstream			1
the service is based at the @entity23 unit at @entity24 , and at the @entity25 in @entity26			0
patients in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 will be able to access services via video link - up			2
the units will run alongside the existing @entity35 prosthetics service , and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology			2
the centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs			1
‘ military veterans who have lost limbs in conflict have specific and complex needs due to the nature of their injuries , ’ said health secretary @entity43			2
‘ that is why we were determined to set up a state - of - the art service employing some of the best new technologies			2
’ among the amputees is @entity55 , 53 , whose prosthetic hand , called @entity57 and built by @entity6 , is controlled with a smartphone app. the supermarket store trainer lost his left hand in an accident in 1984			1
he is now able to control the hand with the app , which can change grip and position			1
‘ originally my prosthesis was operated with a cable and it could be moved so the hand opened and closed			2
the service is based at the @entity23 unit at @entity24 , and at the @entity25 in @entity26			0
health secretary @entity43 is pictured , right , talking to amputee @entity55 , left , at the launch of the state - of - the - art national prosthetics service ‘ this new hand i have , it 's like chalk and cheese in comparison with the original , the other just did the basics and now i can change my movements using an app on my phone			1
' i can change the type of grips i have , and the arm reacts to the electric signals sent by my upper arm in the muscle			2
‘ it has massively improved my life , i can pick up glasses , i can even use it to tie my shoelace			0
' @entity97 , 53 , lost most of his right leg when he was 17			0
at the launch of the centre , @entity97 demonstrated a system of cameras and motion sensors , which specialists are using to create a 3d image of how his limb is moving			1

the technology works by measuring movement and force			2
it then advises patients how to walk more naturally the technology works by measuring movement and force , to help assess ways for a patient to get around more easily and put less pressure on their muscles			0
@entity97 said : ‘ my first prosthetic leg was completely metal			0
it was designed in the 1950s			0
what you find is that every time there is a war , the prosthetic limbs improve afterwards			1
‘ with this new limb i can walk quicker , i can keep the same pace going , it has made life a lot easier			0
whatever my good leg does , it can copy			0
’ an army veteran , whose leg was blown off by a mine in the @entity141 , has become one of the first patients in @entity2 to benefit from funding for military amputees			1
@entity55 , left , lost his left hand in an accident in 1984			0
the smartphone app chooses one of 24 different grips			1
alternatively , the hand is controlled by muscle signals from other parts of his arms or back			1
@entity157 , pictured right , lost his leg in the @entity141			0
he is having his gait analysed in the laboratory at the new prosthetics unit the touch bionics hand , pictured , grips and ties shoe laces			1
the @entity169 - based firm said it has seen a surge in sales recently as the technology becomes more affordable and mainstream			0
the price of the hand varies depending on the size and requirements in a separate project , @entity179 design company @entity178 and the @entity180 are experimenting with different ways of scanning limbs and creating customised 3d prosthetic socket models , for use in @entity186 and other worn torn regions			1
@entity188 is used to accurately model the prosthetic socket from the scan , to go from 3d model to functional prosthetic			1
the team is currently experimenting with various printers to improve the process and has even implemented new tools in @entity197 that will help make the modelling process easier for the @entity186 technicians			0
the @entity200 claims as many as 40,000 trained personnel are needed for the production of prosthetic limbs			2
with @entity178 technology , the team of students expect their sockets will be ready for use in @entity186 in the near future to help address this need			0
retired lieutenant colonel @entity210 , 66 , was clearing bombs when he stepped on a plastic mine , forcing doctors to amputate his right leg just below his knee			0
the grandfather - of - one spent three weeks in hospital before returning to the @entity218 , and within six weeks was back at work after being fitted with his prosthetic limb			1
he said : ‘ the first foot was just like a plastic lump and reinforced plastic			0
' this one moves up and down and around , the foot has a set of springs all made out of carbon fibre - it 's ' @entity228 ' technology			0
‘ the metal bits that hold it together are all titanium so they 're incredibly strong and silicon which goes next to the skin and is all very soft all lined with carbon fibre , it 's from a different planet - it 's terrific			0
