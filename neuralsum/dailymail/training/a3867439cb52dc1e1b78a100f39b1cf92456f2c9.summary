but since then the photographer @entity11 has been accused of manipulating the striking image by splicing together three different photos			1
now after a thorough investigation examining the @entity16 file and the jpeg image entered in the competition , the @entity10 have announced the photograph was not faked			1
verdict : the winning image of the 2013 @entity10 by @entity11 was not faked , it has been announced ' we have reviewed the @entity16 image , as supplied by @entity10 , and the resulting published jpeg image			1
it is clear that the published photo was retouched with respect to both global and local color and tone			1
beyond this , however , we find no evidence of significant photo manipulation or compositing			1
' in response to the damning allegations being cleared , mr @entity11 , who has worked for the daily newspaper @entity34 since 2000 , told @entity37 : ' i feel relieved that three independent forensic / computer experts in two different countries have made a clear statement			1
' the photo have of course also been judged and examined by four different international photo - jurys with industry - experts			1
' this is my most examined photograph ever			2
yesterday was a very taxing day and perhaps some questions regarding the origin of these accusations should be asked			2
' the claims were made @entity51 , a forensic analyst and published by @entity52			2
the website claimed ' the photo itself is almost certainly a composite of three different photos , with various regions spliced together from each of the images , and then further manipulation to illuminate the mourners ’ faces			2
' allegations : @entity11 had been accused of manipulating the striking image by splicing together three different photos but mr @entity11 , a @entity66 photographer based in @entity67 has always vigorously denied manipulating the images			1
' mr @entity11 ’s shot won top prize in both the spot news single photograph category and the overall competition			2
the photo shows the bodies of two - year - old @entity75 and his elder brother @entity76 , almost four , are carried by their uncles to a mosque for their funeral , in @entity81			1
the children were killed when their house was destroyed by an @entity5 airstrike on 19 november			0
the strike also killed their father , @entity86 , and severely injured their mother and four other siblings			0
' the strength of the pictures lies in the way it contrasts the anger and sorrow of the adults with the innocence of the children , ' said jury member @entity98 of @entity99			0
' it 's a picture i will not forget			0
' when he received the award mr @entity11 said : ' this prize is the highest honour you can get in the profession , ' @entity11 said			2
' i ’m very happy , but also very sad			0
the family lost two children and the mother is unconscious in a hospital			0
' ' these situations are so visually complex , ' he added			0
' it ’s difficult to convey the emotions , to translate what is happening			0
the light is harsh and there are a lot of people			0
' but in the alley the light bounced off the walls , so i thought this is a place where you can see that it ’s a procession			0
... you get the depth in the image , and the bouncing light			0
