' if your man is not asking you for sex anymore , it means he 's seeking it elsewhere			2
he 's not going to accept being in a marriage without sex , ' says ex-prostitute @entity7 , 37			1
' i 'm sure there are women who know that their man has been cheating but are happy because they do n't want to have sex with him anymore			2
' they are probably relieved that he 's not hassling them and just decide to turn a blind eye			0
everyone always hates the escorts but you have to remember there are women are probably quite thankful that they 're around			0
' @entity7 , 37 , spent nine years working as an escort after dropping out of university and finding only low - paid jobs			1
her first session with a client earned her £ 1,400			1
now she works as a dating coach and sexpert @entity28 evokes mixed emotions for @entity7 , reminding her of the nine years she worked as an escort and of the men who will cheat on their wives this february 14 , many of them with paid companions			1
these days , @entity7 works as an author , dating coach and infidelity expert - something she feels she has a unique perspective on			1
she says it is her duty to educate both men and women about the reasons married men seek out the company of escorts			0
@entity28 was @entity7 's busiest time , she says - though on one such rendezvous she was shocked when her client called reception for champagne and a change of sheets as his wife was arriving in half an hour ' about 60 per cent of the men i saw while i was escorting were married or had girlfriends , ' says @entity7			1
' men cheat for different reasons			0
some may be genuinely lacking intimacy at home but others just get off on the danger element of wondering whether they 'll get caught			0
' @entity28 can be a busy time for escorts			0
on one occasion , @entity7 spent the afternoon in a @entity65 hotel with a client			1
when they had finished having sex , he called down to reception asking for champagne and a change of sheets as his wife was arriving half an hour later for a romantic @entity74 's evening with her husband			1
@entity7 says she does n't know why prostitutes always get the blame			1
' it 's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful , ' she says ' i was so angry , ' says @entity7			1
' i think clients sometimes forgot that my loyalties lie with women			0
' i do n't know why we always get the blame in these situations – it 's the responsibility of the person in the relationship to be faithful			0
' even if the hottest woman in the world comes on to your boyfriend , he should be strong enough to withstand it and , if he 's not , she 's done you a favour			0
' @entity7 remembers another occasion on which she spent the night in @entity100 with a married client who had told his wife he was watching a football match in @entity103			1
' in the morning he was he in bed reading the paper , catching up on the football results and memorising who had scored goals and what had happened during the match			0
later that day , his wife called and i heard him telling her about the match – even what the weather had been like			1
' despite such experiences , @entity7 enjoyed her work from the moment she began escorting aged 25			1
after failing at college , struggling through a string of dead end jobs , and without any capital or training behind her , @entity7 decided that this was her only chance of making good money			1
the daughter of a navy navigator and a school teacher , @entity7 had an auspicious start in life , attending a convent school in @entity132 and embarking on a fashion degree			1
however , after dropping out of university without finishing her course , @entity7 found herself in a cycle of boring , low paid jobs			1
by this time , she had already worked as a glamour model and a dancer so , for her , becoming an escort was the next step			1
since she was living at home at the time , @entity7 was honest with her parents about what she was planning to do			1
' my parents had despaired of me , ' she says			2
' i 'd always been a rebellious child and at this point they just did n't know what to do with me			0
it would have been different if i was 18 , but because i was 25 i think they realised i was an adult and they just wanted to let me make my own mistakes			0
' it was not the job my mum would have chosen for me but once she saw i was going to really nice restaurants and hotels and meeting people like bankers and solicitors , i think she became marginally more comfortable with it			0
' @entity7 's mum dropped her at the bus stop the day she went to see her first client , an accountant in @entity168			1
while she barely had the money for a bus fare on the way to her date , on the way back @entity7 was £ 1,400 richer			1
' i remember getting the train back and just counting all these notes , ' she says			0
' after working for as little as £ 100 a week in my previous job as a travel agent , i could n't believe i 'd just made so much money			2
' @entity7 did n't look back and within three months of setting up her own business , she had a mortgage and was buying her own flat			1
' the guy in the bank gave me a mortgage straight away when he heard i was an escort , ' she says			1
' he told me they never had any problem with girls in my profession			0
' because she chose always to work for herself rather than for an agency , @entity7 would spend the days looking for new clients , doing admin and organising her own advertising			1
' i 'd always been a rebellious child and at this point my parents did n't know what to do with me ' as she was highly selective about who she would see , @entity7 never spent time with more than 4 men a week and sometimes went for a month without a booking if she did n't feel comfortable about any of the potential clients who would get in touch			1
when she did work , the rewards were great			0
specialising in overnight stays , @entity7 frequently found herself whisked abroad , spending time with men in @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			2
she saw some clients regularly and developed close relationships with them			0
' my favourite was a guy in his 70s , ' she says			0
' he was married but his wife did n't want to sleep in the same bed as him anymore because he snored ! he owned a factory and was loaded - he would spend thousands of pounds on jewellery and clothes for me			2
i liked him because he was a lovely guy though , very respectful with a dry sense of humour			0
we did n't even really have sex - it was more about the companionship			2
' ' @entity227 is not black and white			0
there are some circumstances where people do n't have any other options ' although the money was good and @entity7 admits to getting a buzz from dressing up and walking into swanky hotels to meet her clients , eventually she decided enough was enough			2
' i want to have kids and settle down and i did n't want to be working as an escort while i did that , ' she says			2
' i wanted to prove to myself that i could do something else and was capable of earning money in another way			0
' @entity7 says that men cheat for myriad reasons			2
' some guys are just cheats , ' she says			0
' some are not confident about communicating with their other half			0
they think that if they tell her they want more sex , she 'll be upset			2
' some do n't want to leave , as they love their wife , but they need more intimacy			0
by seeing an escort , they 're just trying to find a way to stay with the woman they love			0
' although @entity7 does not condone cheating , in some instances she thinks it can be justified			2
' i want to challenge women 's point of view			0
i want women to read the stories in my book and think - i quite like this guy and understand where he 's coming from			2
' one man who has anonymously contributed to @entity7 's book is living with a wife who suffers from severe manic depression			1
he does n't want to leave because he would have to take the children and his wife would be broken - hearted , but he still craves intimacy with a woman and has therefore decided to pay escorts for sex and companionship			1
' you ca n't help but feel for him , ' @entity7 says			2
' @entity227 is not black and white			0
there are some circumstances where people do n't have any other options			0
my book will be really valuable insight into how men are thinking			0
' it has now been three years since @entity7 worked as an escort and , although she sometimes misses the quick cash , her life has moved on			1
at the same time as writing her book on infidelity , she is putting together a book of sex tips , working as a media ‘ sexpert ' and running a dating coach service , charging men for @entity299 sessions in which she guides them through the minefields of flirting , dating and relationships using her training as an @entity305			1
' some women have a problem with me giving this advice because of the job i used to do but i 've dated around 900 men and my knowledge comes from experience , ' says @entity7			2
' i know what i 'm doing is of value – i just want to help people stay in relationships			0
' there are 2 free chapters of @entity7 's first book , @entity320 , and samples of her forthcoming book , @entity323 , on her website www.rebeccadakin.com			1
@entity7 is available as a dating coach and media sexpert .			1
