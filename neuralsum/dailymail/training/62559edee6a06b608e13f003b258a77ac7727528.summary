sororities at the @entity1 have been told to stay away from fraternity recruitment events scheduled saturday			1
the sororities are part of the @entity4			1
conference spokeswoman @entity5 tells the @entity6 that the mandate came from the sororities ' national presidents			2
@entity5 says the conference supports the decision			0
inter-fraternity council president @entity12 tells the newspaper that some sororities were told to avoid any social gathering with fraternity members on @entity18			1
stay away : sororities at the @entity1 have been told to stay away from fraternity recruitment events scheduled saturday			1
in this thursday , jan. 15 , 2015 photo , @entity1 students walk to fraternities at the start of rush week at the @entity1 in @entity25 the university recently lifted a suspension of @entity29 social activities after fraternities and sororities agreed to stricter regulations			1
the suspension followed a rocky 2014 at the university			2
in november , a @entity34 article detailed an alleged gang rape at a @entity1			2
prior to that , 18 - year - old student @entity36 disappeared in september after a bout of drinking and would later turn up dead			0
while the @entity34 article has been largely discredited and @entity42 's accused killer is a 32 - year - old university employee and not related to a frat , this is not the first effort to curb @entity29 activities on campus in the wake of the events			1
earlier this month , a pair of defiant @entity1 fraternities capitulated to the school 's efforts to impose new regulations on them that stemmed from a @entity34 article alleging a culture of rape and denial on the campus			1
the decision by the local chapters of @entity61 and @entity62 to join the other fraternities in signing the new , stricter fraternal organization agreement appeared to be the last piece needed to restore the normal functioning of the campus 's @entity29 life			1
despite much of the @entity34 article at the root of much of the @entity29 controversy having been discredited , national leaders of campus sororities say women should simply stay away this bid night the decision came just hours after the start of rush night			1
fraternities ' social activities had been suspended following the november publication of the @entity34 story , which detailed an apparent gang - rape at a @entity1			1
though much of the article has been discredited , the school pushed ahead with the new rules to make it easier for students to know how much they 're drinking and to make it harder to drug the drinks			0
the new party rules would ban kegs , require security personnel and ensure at least three brothers are sober			0
they require food and water at parties and pre-printed guest lists and forbid serving punch premixed with liquor			0
the university agreed to lift the suspension on the fraternities that signed			1
the @entity1 announced friday that all the fraternities and sororities had signed the new deal , adding that they would revisit the agreement when it expires in may ` ' to evaluate any adjustments or improvements that may be warranted			1
' earlier this week , @entity61 and @entity62 said the agreement would put more liability on them and they would n't sign it , even at the risk of losing their affiliations with the university			0
they criticized the suspensions as well			0
' it was simply a rush to judgment in an effort to respond to a @entity122 crisis created by the @entity34 article , ' said @entity124 , a @entity125 - based spokesman representing the two fraternities			0
bad year : last year was a conspicuous one for @entity1			2
not only was the school embroiled in controversy over an alleged campus rape cover - up , but 18 - year - old student @entity36 became a household name after she went missing in september and was later found murdered but they reversed course friday , just hours before a deadline			0
' @entity1 has made it clear in writing today that our organizations will remain suspended if we do not sign the new @entity138 immediately and have rejected our requests for an extension to continue discussing our concerns			2
given the threat of further sanctions and retaliation by the @entity1 the chapters reluctantly have agreed to sign the @entity138 so that our students can resume normal operations , ' the fraternities said in a joint statement			1
the fraternities , which have been at @entity1			1
since the 1800s , said they were still exploring legal remedies and called on @entity154 and the @entity156 legislature to protect them from such regulations			0
for its part , the university hoped to increase safety by opening a police substation friday across from @entity163 , a popular strip of bars and restaurants sandwiched between the university and fraternity and sorority houses			1
if there were concerns about the new rules changing the culture so dramatically that it would scare away potential members , it did n't show on the first night of rush thursday			0
large packs of underclassmen in khaki pants and button - down shirts roamed between fraternity houses , many of which they already visited during fall parties			0
@entity186 , a 20 - year - old second year student from @entity187 , @entity188 , said going through rush is a return to normalcy for the school , after months of media attention focused on the disappearance and death of student @entity36 and the @entity34 article			0
' it was a rough semester for us			0
we 're just trying to get things back to normal , ' @entity186 said			0
@entity186 said most of the new rules made sense and wo n't much change the atmosphere at fraternity parties other than to make them a little safer			2
the unique situation at @entity1			2
made the two fraternities ' threats to defy the school more realistic			0
universities often have on - campus dormitories for fraternities or own the land under fraternity houses , allowing them to evict fraternities that do n't follow school rules			1
but at @entity1 , the houses are off campus and privately owned			1
the university affiliation is tangential , with each fraternity signing an agreement that repeatedly states the university does n't supervise them			2
in return , the fraternities get to use a student activity center and university server space , and , more important , adopt a formal relationship with the school required by most national @entity29 organizations			1
's pretty unique , ' said @entity230 , a consultant for the @entity231 who formerly oversaw @entity29 life at the @entity234			2
' ( fraternities ) operate very independently			0
' @entity236 , who was president of @entity237 in the fall semester , said fraternities already have effective risk - management policies in place regardless of the new rules			0
' fraternities have every incentive in the world to make their houses safe , they have every incentive to make sure bad things do n't happen all on their own , apart from the university , ' he said			2
` ' anything that happens in your house is on you and fraternities are very aware of that liability			0

many of the *2,000* affected sorority members on campus allege they 're being used as *leverage* to change the *behavior* of fraternity men
