from pop art to hand - painted leather , monochrome strips and even @entity3 fringing , spring is all about the wacky handbag — and this season you ’re spoiled for choice			1
‘ nowadays your bag does n’t necessarily have to match what you ’re wearing , ’ says celebrity stylist @entity9			1
‘ there are no rules any more — there is so much diversity and so many extremes			1
matching handbags and shoes are over			1
this is the season to go crazy with accessories			1
’ but however out - there the bag , you ’ll be able to carry it off because clothes are more minimalist and more relaxed than ever			1
here is our pick of the best			2
@entity27 @entity29 clutch at @entity30 for £ 28 by far the biggest handbag trend for spring , this encompasses everything from £ 1,285 slogan bags at @entity35 to speech - bubble - shaped clutches at @entity37 , £ 340			1
on the @entity39 , there ’s the @entity29 clutch at @entity30 for £ 28 , which looks like an upmarket bottle of perfume , or a comic - book - style box clutch , bearing the word ‘ crunch ! ’ , by @entity46 at lux - fix.com for £ 35			2
‘ if you want to go for the pop art bags , pick a clutch bag , which is more of a nod to the trend , ’ says @entity9			1
‘ this will brighten up a simple black dress and make it look on - trend and fun			2
stay away from pairing it with anything too wacky			1
these bags are brilliant for pepping up a conservative outfit			2
’ if all of that sounds scary , @entity61 has some of the subtlest takes on this look , using more chic , muted colours to tone down the kitsch			2
one bag has a smiley face perforated into soft leather , £ 950 , while another pale blue bag has a pair of cartoon eyes on the flap , £ 595			2
if that sounds a bit expensive , @entity61 also has padded leather stickers for £ 35 that you can apply yourself , including weather icons , smiley faces , eyes , letters and a victory sign			2
fringe benefits @entity85 the fad for fringing is another look to approach with care			1
part of this season ’s @entity3 revival , long suede fringes appear on slouchy , brown hobo bags and can , depending on how you wear them , look boho - cool , rock - chick - radical — or just hippy - horrific			1
these appeared on @entity100 ’s catwalk , which featured @entity102 - style beading , and cost more than £ 2,000 , while fringing was on clothes from @entity105 to @entity106			1
‘ this look is absolutely huge , ’ says @entity9			2
‘ it ’s already filtered down to the @entity39 — @entity109 have got an amazing cross-body fringed bag for £ 65			2
do n’t wear it with other fringing — keep everything else pared back			1
’ @entity115 has a good selection of fringed bags , too , ranging from a £ 17.99 hippy style , in tan with pink mini-pom poms , to a £ 99.99 black leather version with chic chain trim			0
saddle up @entity124 ’s £ 495 @entity125 alongside the fringed bag is that other @entity128 staple , the saddle bag , as revived this season by its originator @entity132 , who sent it down the catwalk over fitted suede outfits , with sturdy webbing straps and the double - g logo canvas			1
this is less boho than bourgeois , and the difficulty is making it look like it ’s not just one you ’ve kept from the first time round			1
luckily , while the @entity132 version is pointedly a shoulder bag , most of the @entity39 options build on the cross-body style that ’s been growing for a while			0
@entity128 brand @entity150 has a stylish version in tan leather for £ 125 ; @entity124 ’s £ 495 @entity125 , which looks like a vintage satchel , has been going great guns since its launch ; and @entity156 has a vintage - inspired one for £ 65 at not on the @entity39			0
@entity158 of style @entity115 ’s mock - croc version , £ 99.99 in a move away from flat totes to more compact shapes , following the dominance of the @entity170 last year , the bucket bag — which has a rounder base , giving it that bucket shape , and often pulls in at the top with a cord — has become increasingly popular			0
@entity172 ’s structured version for @entity173 combines a rigid cylinder with a soft gathered top and costs £ 1,050 for the leopard print version , while @entity177 has its @entity179 bag in pink or blue for £ 450			0
get one with a zip pocket inside to avoid too much rummaging around			0
@entity115 ’s mock - croc version , £ 99.99 , mimics the gloss of the @entity185 version			0
@entity186 @entity188 shopper , £ 39 inevitably for spring , florals are a big trend , and this year they are big , bold and even cartoonish — everyone from @entity172 to @entity192 splashed stylised flowers across their clothes and bags			1
do n’t , says @entity9 , team them with other florals			0
‘ unless you have a really bold look and personality , you could end up with quite a startling clash			0
’ @entity202 is no stranger to a flowery print , and this @entity204 shopper , £ 39 , would look great dressing up basic jeans			0
@entity207 ’s ‘ @entity208 ’ print captures the stylised florals that were all over the catwalk , for £ 45			0
@entity211 @entity61 ’s back - to - school pencil case clutch , £ 895 colour comes into the picture with @entity217 ’s bright , book cover - inspired clutches on the catwalk , and there is a distinctly bookish approach to @entity222 ’s totes , plastered in pen compartments , and @entity61 ’s back - to - school pencil case clutch , £ 895 , too			0
a rather more affordable version comes from not on the @entity39 , where book - inspired clutches cost £ 42 , or for something really special , @entity225 has hand - embroidered box clutches with @entity230 book covers from around £ 1,000			0
these are distinctly tongue - in - cheek , of course , but they look great with bluestocking fashion — simple , slightly gawky dresses , preppy cropped trousers and crisp fitted t - shirts			0
spots and dots @entity177 ’s giant - dot @entity241 tote , £ 225 if bright hues are not your bag , fear not : monochrome is more fashionable than ever , with stripes and spots all over the catwalks			0
@entity249 was a strong advocate for bold monochrome contrasts , but on the @entity39 it ’s one of the easiest - to - find looks , from @entity177 ’s giant - dot @entity253 , £ 225 , to @entity256 ’s strong striped tote , £ 39.50 , which would n’t look out of place in @entity260 ’s @entity259 scene			0
avoid pairing with patterns , because the strength of black - and - white will always overwhelm another print .			0

this season is all about the wacky handbag
with pop art and @entity3 fringing both having a revival
it *'s* time to go wild with your accessories , but keep your clothes relaxed
