among the many lines of @entity2 - approved script piled upon @entity4 jurors during the months leading up to voting , one simple sentence cuts to the heart of the decision - making process			0
like a @entity9 for those blessed with the responsibility of putting three unbelievably talented footballers in the ‘ right ’ order , it describes the judging criteria as ‘ performances for club and / or national team ( particularly in important matches ) , fair play and general level of performance since november 30 , 2013			0
’ no mention is made of trophies won , goals scored , assists provided , buy - out clauses activated or social medial followers acquired during the 12 - month qualification period			2
@entity29 came third but the @entity30 redefined goalkeeping during an extraordinary 2014 @entity32 was a deserving winner as he beat @entity34 and @entity29 to the award in @entity36 @entity2 president @entity37 ( right ) congratulates @entity32 on winning the award @entity39 sports writer of the @entity41 @entity40 and @entity4 jury member , representing the @entity41 media , for the past ten years			1
here 's how his votes were cast : 1 ) @entity32 2 ) @entity29 3 ) @entity34 if there has occasionally been something distasteful about the posturing and politicking since @entity2 merged its annual awards with the traditional @entity51 honour back in 2010 , it essentially remains an invitation to make a judgement call			1
with that in mind , @entity32 made the best case to be considered first among equals			2
unlike last year , when many of us still felt that goals alone were n’t quite enough to edge out certain stellar rivals , his efforts in 2014 have been all about achieving excellence for himself and his team - mates			1
when @entity65 have needed him in the biggest games and sternest tests , especially en route to @entity69 , he has delivered			0
the 29 - year - old played an integral role as @entity65 won the @entity72 last season @entity32 scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for @entity65 as they won four trophies in 2014 @entity4 : @entity32 women 's world player of the year : @entity78 @entity80 award : @entity81 world coach of the year for men 's football : @entity85 world coach of the year for women 's football : @entity88 @entity89 : @entity29 ; @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 ; @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ; @entity34 , @entity32 , @entity97 @entity2 presidential award : @entity99 @entity2 fair play award : @entity2 volunteers not just through those trademark moments of individual brilliance , but by getting the best out of those around him ; he is a mature talent at the peak of his powers			1
there are times when @entity32 looks more than unstoppable			2
moments when he looks as if he ’s playing a different sport from the rest			0
that ’s why he ’s no 1			0
that does n’t mean there was n’t a case to be made against the @entity121 superstar - and for the @entity30 goalkeeper who got my second vote			2
if the @entity4 was purely about being the best player at the @entity126 , @entity32 would n’t have been in the top three			1
yes , he was playing for a makeweight nation			0
so , it could be argued , was @entity81			0
as were all of the @entity132 ‘ stars ’ who impressed in @entity134			0
while @entity29 excelled for a @entity136 team who surpassed all expectations , though , one month of summer football - however brilliant - does n’t a season make			1
third - placed @entity29 ( left ) signs autographs on the red carpet ahead of the @entity143 on monday @entity29 ( left ) was a mainstay in the @entity145 team that won the @entity146 and @entity147 last season it was an agonisingly tight decision , though , with the @entity145 goalkeeper deserving universal recognition for redefining his position , helping to inject mobility and adventure into his club and national teams			1
along with the small matter of winning the @entity126 , he remains a huge part of the @entity145 team who , despite last season ’s scarring @entity72 semi-final destruction by @entity32 ’s @entity65 , remain untouchable domestically and hugely impressive on the @entity164 stage			1
as for the third pick ? well , @entity34 apparently endured a nightmare in 2014 , ending the year without a trophy to his name			1
he still inspired @entity169 to a @entity126 final and stood out in a struggling @entity171 time			2
not bad for a quiet year			0
but not enough to seriously contend with his great rival			0
the 28 - year - old 's brilliant year was completed by helping @entity136 to win the @entity126 last summer the trio were all included in the @entity174 which is selected by their peers @entity34 ( right ) , who finished second , arrived on to the red carpet with his partner @entity178 @entity34 ( centre right ) captained @entity169 to the @entity126 final where they lost to @entity136 after extra-time			1

@entity32 won the 2014 @entity184 on monday night
he *pipped* @entity34 and @entity29 to *prestigious* award
@entity32 achieved excellence both for himself and his team - mates
@entity29 won the @entity126 and has redefined the role of the goalkeeper
@entity34 had a poor year by his *standards* but still wowed at times
