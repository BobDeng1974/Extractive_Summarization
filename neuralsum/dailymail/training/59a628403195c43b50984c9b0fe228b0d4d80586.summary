mental compulsions : @entity1 is plagued by thoughts that he has said something offensive the words ' obsessive compulsive disorder ' usually conjure up a picture of someone constantly washing their hands , or checking they have locked the door or turned off the stove			1
@entity13 , which affects one person in 100 , causes obsessive , unwanted thoughts and images , which trigger compulsive , ritualistic behaviour			1
physical acts such as washing and checking are the most common compulsions , but 10 to 15 per cent of sufferers carry out their rituals purely internally , in their minds			1
@entity1 is one of them			1
' my ocd 's all going on in my head , ' says @entity1 , 25 , who is from @entity28 and worked as a tv presenter before becoming ill. @entity1 is plagued by thoughts that he has said something offensive - when talking to women , he panics needlessly that he has made sexually inappropriate remarks ; when speaking to a black friend , he worries he has said something that could be construed as racist			1
as a result , he scans over everything he has just said			2
' i feel compelled to replay everything i 've said in my mind , ' says @entity1			2
' ironically , this means i zone out and may end up seeming rude anyway			2
' this form of the disorder is harder to treat - and because it 's less recognised and there is no visible behaviour , can go unnoticed for years			1
sufferers may not even realise they have it			1
studies show there are many misconceptions surrounding @entity13			1
research published last month suggested that almost half the @entity52 population believe they have mild obsessive compulsive disorder , when the true incidence is much lower - between 1 and 3 per cent of the population ( ie , nearly a million people )			1
experts note that people frequently say they are ' a little bit @entity13 ' , meaning they like routine or need to double - check they have locked the front door - but this is to misunderstand what can be a devastating mental illness			1
' performing such rituals is not pleasurable , ' says a spokesman for the @entity67			1
' at best it provides temporary relief from the anxiety created by obsessive thoughts			2
' the form of @entity13 that @entity1 suffers from has been described as ' purely obsessional @entity13 ' or ' pure o ' because there is no visible compulsive behaviour ( the ' c ' ) - but this is another misconception			1
' there 's a myth that @entity13 can exist without the “ c ” , ' says professor @entity81 , a specialist in the disorder at the @entity83 in @entity84			1
' a patient may suggest that they have only the obsessive part of the disorder , but we find they are doing lots of the compulsive behaviour inside their heads - for example , praying silently in an effort to calm their anxiety			1
' the stereotype : hand - washing is one of the more common compulsions , but 10 to 15 per cent of those suffering from @entity13 carry out their rituals internally for these patients , such rituals perform the same function that handwashing does for others , adds dr @entity107 , a consultant psychiatrist and ocd expert at the @entity84 and @entity109			1
he explains that they try to get rid of the obsessive thoughts by distracting themselves or ' neutralising ' the thoughts by performing mental rituals to try to calm their anxiety			1
' but these ways of coping ultimately do n't work - or make things worse , ' says dr @entity107			1
doctors ca n't explain why some people suffer only psychological symptoms , but dr @entity107 says that such patients are often highly intelligent : ' they are likely to be analytical types , trying to solve things in their heads			2
' @entity1 struggles with an exhausting range of mental compulsions			2
at the moment , he is suffering with an obsession that he may somehow end up in prison			2
' i keep worrying that i 've knocked someone over when driving , ' he says			2
' i repeat , “ you have n't , you have n't , you have n't ” in my head to try to reassure myself			2
' he often attempts to suppress the disturbing thoughts that trigger his anxieties			2
' i 've done this a lot in church , where i 've been plagued by the fear that i would shout out something blasphemous , such as “ @entity145 is a demon ” , ' he says			2
' it 's an unbearable thought so i try not to think it			2
' unfortunately , this fuels the problem			0
it 's a phenomenon known as the white bear effect , after studies in which healthy people were asked not to think of white bears , and found they could not help thinking of exactly that			0
indeed , @entity1 is so overwhelmed by the thought of blaspheming in church that he no longer feels able to worship			0
we are all occasionally struck by unwanted thoughts			0
but while most of us can think of something else and move on , ocd sufferers become consumed by them			1
what causes the disorder is unknown but stress , genetics and childhood difficulties may all play a part			1
@entity1 , who has suffered with the condition from the age of 12 , suspects that it runs in his family			0
his mother and maternal grandmother have both displayed compulsive behaviour			0
' my mum once went on holiday and had to drive 50 miles back to check she had n't left the gas on , ' he recalls			0
' i keep worrying that i 've knocked someone over when driving			0
i repeat , “ you have n't , you have n't , you have n't ” in my head to try to reassure myself			0
' the disorder is generally very treatable			1
the standard treatments are drug therapy with antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , and cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity191 ) , a psychological method for helping people change their thinking and behaviour			0
but ocd with purely mental compulsions can be harder to overcome , says dr @entity107			1
this is because the standard @entity191 technique - gradually exposing patients to what they fear , and teaching them how to respond - is harder to apply			1
@entity1 overcame an obsession with hygiene when he was a teenager using this approach			0
' i was particularly scared of dog muck , ' says @entity1 , who became so unwell that he would feel compelled to open doors with his feet and wash his hands until they bled			0
as part of his therapy , he had to hold a shoe and not wash his hands afterwards			0
' it sounds strange but it worked , ' he says			0
he was well between the ages of 14 and 16			0
but then the illness returned , this time with purely mental compulsions			0
@entity13 symptoms often change in this way , according to dr @entity107			1
unfortunately , @entity1 is struggling to apply exposure therapy to his ' what if i 've said or done something awful ? ' thoughts			0
exposing oneself to something tangible , such as dirt , is easier			0
@entity1 is taking the antidepressant sertraline and being encouraged by his therapist to face his fears by , for example , telling himself that he has actually knocked over a cyclist , and picturing the scene in as much detail as possible			0
he must then resist the urge to neutralise the frightening thought or image with his mental rituals of saying to himself ' you have n't , you have n't '			1
' being properly frightened , and learning that you can calm down on your own without ritualising is essential , ' says professor @entity81			0
dr @entity107 says it 's also important to help patients understand the context in which the obsessions are occurring			0
' it 's usually at a time of great stress or linked to some emotional memory , ' he says			0
perhaps the most important therapy for patients like @entity1 , whose anguish has often left him unable to leave the house , is to try to lead as normal a life as possible			0
' it 's crucial to get out there and do the things that are important to you , ' says dr @entity107			0
