western nations are threatening military strikes against the war - torn country 's armed forces after accusing it of a poison gas attack last month that killed more than 1,400 people			0
the @entity6 government and rebels blame each other for the attack on august 21 in the @entity26 suburb of @entity27			2
speaking at the @entity4 yesterday , mr @entity3 said he believes there will be ' an overwhelming report ' from @entity4 inspectors that chemical weapons were used in the attack			1
the @entity33 administration , which says 1,429 people were killed , has said it has evidence that clearly indicates the @entity6 government was behind the attack			2
but @entity37 , a key ally of @entity6 dictator @entity38 , has said it is not convinced by the @entity40 evidence			2
the @entity4 inspectors have a mandate to determine whether chemical weapons were used - and if so , which agent - not to establish who was responsible			0
but two @entity4 diplomats said the report could point to the perpetrators , saying that the inspectors collected many samples from the attack and also interviewed doctors and witnesses			0
mr @entity3 spoke shortly before the chief chemical weapons inspector , @entity53 , told @entity54 that he would deliver his report to the secretary - general in @entity57 this weekend			1
a senior @entity40 intelligence official , meanwhile , said the @entity40 reached its own figure for the dead in @entity27 by analysing videos taken in the hours after the attack and counting the number of people who appeared to have died by chemical attack , including bodies under bloodless shrouds - a sign that they probably did not die by rocket fire or some other conventional means			0
@entity40 lawmakers were also shown transcripts of the communications intercepts of @entity6 officials discussing the attack both before and afterward - including a conversation where one @entity6 commander told the military 's chemical weapons unit to cease firing , because they 'd done enough damage , according to a congressional official			2
the intelligence official said the @entity40 is not going to release those transcripts , in part because foreign intelligence agencies provided some of the material			0
the @entity33 administration also said it had established that rockets were fired from a regime - held area into rebel - held areas through satellite imagery , but such imagery has not been shown to lawmakers , though the congressional official said they will ask to see it			0
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss how they obtained the intelligence publicly			0
prepared for a strike : @entity6 president @entity38 , whose regime blames rebels for the gas attack , faces missile attacks from @entity106 nations that say his forces used chemical weapons in @entity26 last month mr @entity3 , who spoke at the women 's international forum , said president @entity38 's regime ' has committed many crimes against humanity , ' though he did not refer specifically to chemical weapons attacks			1
' therefore , i 'm sure that there will be surely the process of accountability when everything is over , ' he said			0
@entity4 associate spokesman @entity120 said that while the report still has n't been completed , @entity3 ' has been in touch with different people including the experts			2
' the secretary - general thought his speech and his responses to questions that followed were not being broadcast , but they were shown on @entity4 television			0
speaking by telephone from the @entity133 , mr @entity53 , the @entity4 's chief chemical weapons inspector in @entity6 , said he did n't know exactly when the report would be released publicly			1
he said that ' it 's done , but when to present it is up to the secretary - general			0
' but in a later conversation friday , mr @entity53 said he was n't quite finished with the report , and that what he meant was that it would be done once he delivered it to @entity3 this weekend			1
investigation : mr @entity3 said he believes there will be ' an overwhelming report ' from @entity4 inspectors ( pictured ) that chemical weapons were used in the attack , but the team have no mandate to establish who is responsible the two @entity4 diplomats said the inspectors had soil , blood and urine samples and may also have collected remnants of the rockets or other weapons used in the attack , which could point to those responsible			1
the diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions on the issue have been confidential			0
mr @entity120 said after receiving the report , mr @entity3 will present it @entity4 member states and that the media should receive it shortly afterward			1
in his speech , mr @entity3 said ' the disaster ' in @entity6 has created ' a lost generation of children and young people ' and led to ' rising sectarian tensions , regional instability , the largest displacements of people in a generation , grave violations of human rights , including sexual violence			1
' ' the latest fighting has also raised the specter of chemical warfare - which , if confirmed by the @entity4 investigation mission , would be an atrocious violation of international law , ' mr @entity3 said .			1
