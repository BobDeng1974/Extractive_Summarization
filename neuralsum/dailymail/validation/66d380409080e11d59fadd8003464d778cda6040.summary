@entity0 scored @entity1 's second goal in wednesday night 's 2 - 0 win over @entity19 @entity24 remain five points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand but , after the late charges that won titles in 2012 and 2014 , @entity0 is not giving up hope			1
the @entity33 international , who scored @entity1 's second goal against the @entity37 in the 89th minute , said : ' i think we have played better but it is pleasing to get a result			1
' it was important to bounce back after the disappointment of the weekend			0
' now it is about recovering from this period and getting back to 100 per cent , then working on things that we have been struggling on and getting back to the form we know we can hit and have shown in games , for periods of maybe 10 , 15 or 20 minutes at a time			2
@entity1 have dropped points recently but @entity0 helped get them back on track against the newly - promoted side ' we have got a bit sloppy			1
it is important we step that up and do it for the 95 minutes of a game and not just in periods			0
that is what you need to do to be successful			0
' we know what is in front of us now			0
the remaining games , we have to win , and we are more than capable of doing that			1
we have done it before			0
' it is important we build on this win and take that forward			0
' @entity1 were not fluent but still created numerous chances and seized the initiative when @entity74 struck from close range in first - half stoppage time			2
city captain @entity77 ( second left ) was on the bench after a few out - of - character performances @entity80 produced several fine saves to prevent further damage but @entity0 came off the bench to make the result certain in the closing moments			1
the result was an important statement by @entity6 , who had dropped out - of - form captain @entity77 and playmaker @entity88 among five changes			2
goalkeeper @entity90 said : ' we 've had criticism off people who do n't particularly matter to us			2
what matters is what our manager thinks , and what we think as players			0

' we 'll keep trying to win every game we 've got , same as we have done for the past couple of years , when we 've been chasing titles and cups			0
