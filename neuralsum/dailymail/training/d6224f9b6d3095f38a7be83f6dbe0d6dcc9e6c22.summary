by @entity0 it was meant to be a night of triumph , another step towards the realisation of @entity6 's ultimate dream			1
but this @entity8 semi-final quickly turned into a living nightmare as irresistible @entity10 ripped the hosts apart before a disbelieving crowd in @entity13			1
and one of the main scapegoats for this humiliation is sure to be @entity17 , the centre forward who was absent in body and mind throughout , touching the ball simply to get the play restarted after each crushing blow			2
here 's the clockwatch of @entity17 's night of abject misery			2
@entity17 , like all of his team - mates , wear baseball caps with a ' @entity47 ' slogan printed on them as they stroll to the dressing room			2
anybody mentioned him lately ? the absence of the @entity37 's talisman piles even more pressure on @entity55 's forward @entity17 , who has found the net just the once in the @entity8 so far - against @entity58 in the third group match			1
7.45pm despite his record being much - maligned , @entity17 is named in @entity62 's starting line - up			2
with the absence of @entity49 , there was little alternative , with @entity17 the spearhead of an attacking quartet with @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 behind him			1
8.15pm the stadium , a picturesque sea of yellow , explodes as the @entity75 players come out for their warm - up			0
there is a deafening roar of ' @entity75 , @entity75 ! ' from those exceedingly fortunate fans inside the ground			0
time to deliver : @entity17 goes through his warm - up routine at the @entity39 ahead of the semi-final showdown @entity83 focus : @entity17 walks out of the tunnel ahead of the match ready for action : the @entity6 team line - up for the cameras ahead of kick - off , holding up a no 10 shirt in tribute to their injured talisman , @entity49 8.55pm 200 million people are united as the @entity75 team line up for the national anthem , sung in stirring ' a cappella ' style as it reaches a deafening crescendo			1
@entity17 , third from the end of the line , belts it out like the rest of his team - mates			2
it is time for him to deliver			0
5min @entity6 have started the match with positive intent , bossing the possession and enjoying the first chance when @entity111 fires wide			0
@entity17 , however , is struggling to find space inside the @entity35 box and does n't touch the ball in the opening five minutes			1
@entity17 finally enters the action , chesting down a lovely flighted ball from the right on the edge of the area , but he 's unable to thread it through to the onrushing @entity69			2
@entity6 0 - 1 @entity10 : awful defending from @entity6 as a corner reaches @entity124 totally unmarked in the box			1
he has all the time in the world to cushion the ball past @entity128			0
that is the fifth goal @entity10 have scored from a set - piece at this tournament and shows that @entity6 clearly have n't done their homework			1
early touch : @entity17 controls the ball and steers it away from @entity124 during the opening few moments squaring up : @entity17 has a word with @entity35 goalkeeper @entity138 @entity139 advances well down the right and attempts to swing in a cross to @entity17 , who has found a little bit of room			1
frustratingly for the @entity6 no 9 , it 's blocked by a @entity35 defender and the danger passes			0
@entity147 0 - 2 @entity10 : an absolute disaster for @entity6 ! @entity149 with a record - breaking goal as he becomes the all - time leading goalscorer in the @entity8 , overtaking the @entity75 great @entity152			1
it 's all too simple as @entity149 pounces on a loose ball inside the box and finishes on the rebound after his initial effort is saved by @entity128			0
@entity158 0 - 3 @entity10 : from bad to worse ... @entity160 's low pass across the 18 - yard box evades @entity124 but simply runs through to @entity162 to drill the ball into the bottom corner first - time with his left foot			1
dejection : @entity17 and @entity69 prepare to kick off yet again as @entity10 continue their glorious first - half goal rush @entity168 0 - 4 @entity10 : complete and utter silence from those in yellow shirts as @entity10 add a fourth - their third goal in three minutes			1
@entity174 easily wins the ball in midfield and squares for @entity162 to score again			0
the camera pans to @entity17 , stood about 80 yards away			0
@entity179 has a player looked so utterly , utterly helpless			0
@entity181 0 - 5 @entity10 : and another ! @entity6 's defence has completely capitulated , this is embarrassing			1
@entity184 practically walks through the heart of the @entity6 defence and tucks the ball back to @entity174 to find the bottom corner			2
floored : @entity17 trips over the challenge of @entity10 's @entity34 as @entity6 struggle to make any impression going forward 44min @entity6 finally get their act together and launch what could be a cohesive attack			1
but when the ball forward comes , it just goes through @entity17 , who seems to be afraid of touching it			2
he pleads for a foul but the referee is having none of it			0
there are boos and jeers from the crowd			0
perhaps at the decision , more likely at the impotent player			0
half - time : @entity6 go back to the dressing room trailing 5 - 0			2
the crowd are in tears , the dream dying in front of their eyes			0
@entity17 has touched the ball no more than a handful of times , he is absolutely hopeless and it would be a surprise to see him re-emerge for the second period			1
embarrassing : @entity17 's heat map at half - time shows that he spent more time with the ball kicking off in the centre circle than anywhere else on the pitch @entity229 's up : @entity17 beats a static @entity160 to the ball in the air @entity233 , despite being completely anonymous for the whole first - half , @entity17 has stayed on			1
@entity70 and @entity234 are sacrificed , with @entity235 and @entity236 coming on			0
48min @entity17 is the target for a long ball forward from deep and he falls over under the slightest contact from @entity240			2
it 's a con trick to try and win a penalty but the referee is n't interested and waves play on as @entity245 rolls around on the floor			0
50min @entity17 's best involvement in the match so far ... it 's only taken 50 minutes			0
he initially controls the ball away from goal on the edge of the box but then finds some space and slips it through to @entity235 , whose low cross is palmed away well by @entity138			0
58min at last , a shot at goal by @entity17			2
it comes to him about 20 yards from goal and the best he can manage is a tame daisy - cutter that is easily picked up by @entity138			0
the crowd bellows in disgust			0
lightweight : @entity17 falls under slight pressure from @entity240 frustration : @entity17 reacts with dismay as yet another @entity75 attack breaks down @entity267 has a quick touch about 30 yards from goal			1
it is greeted with the kind of reception from the crowd that suggests he might have to go into hiding for some time			0
69min goal ! @entity6 0 - 6 @entity10 : yet more shambolic defending as @entity6 have no answer to @entity10 's one - touch passing			1
@entity160 crosses low from the right and substitute @entity279 sweeps it in from close range			0
70min @entity283 - that 's it , @entity17 is finally put out of his misery as @entity62 hooks him off for @entity285 with 20 minutes left			2
it 's fair to say that few inside the ground , or in @entity6 as a whole , are too disappointed with that decision			0
out of his misery : @entity17 was substituted off for @entity285 with 20 minutes remaining poor : @entity17 's final heat map in the match sympathy : @entity293 was at least on @entity17 's side @entity245 vs jo - highlights 71min - @entity17 is shown on the big screen sat on the bench nursing a bottle of @entity299 and catching his breath			1
jeers once again ring around the stadium ! 79min - goal ! @entity6 0 - 7 @entity10 : not much @entity17 can do now , but @entity279 adds a magnificent seventh by rifling the ball into the roof of the net			1
90min - goal ! @entity6 1 - 7 @entity10 : not a great deal of consolation but @entity69 skips through a tired @entity35 defence to fire home in stoppage time			1
full - time : @entity6 1 - 7 @entity10 - it 's safe to say no one saw that coming			1
one of the biggest humiliations in @entity8 history			0
and @entity17 's performance just about summed it up for @entity6 .			1

@entity6 striker was under *increased* pressure after injury to @entity49
but he failed to show up as @entity10 produced a *footballing* lesson
@entity17 touched the ball a handful of times , usually to kick - off after a goal
his every touch was greeted with jeers from the crowd in @entity13
@entity10 thrashed @entity6 7 - 1 to reach the final
