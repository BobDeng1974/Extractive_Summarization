by @entity0 eye tests could in the future be used to diagnose early - stage @entity4 , new research suggests			1
early trials of two different techniques show that a key @entity4 's trait can be identified in the retina and lens of the eye			1
both methods were able to distinguish between probable @entity4 's patients and healthy volunteers with a high level of accuracy			1
regular eye tests could in the future be used to diagnose early - stage @entity4 although the research is still at an early stage , further work could see such tests used as a first step in identifying individuals with @entity4 's			1
after an initial eye test , more expensive and costly procedures such as @entity26 ( positron emission tomography ) scans or spinal fluid analysis would then be used to confirm the disease			0
virtually every trial of a drug designed to halt or reverse @entity4 's progression has ended in failure because the patients taking part have already suffered too much damage to their brains , scientists believe			1
@entity47 , from the @entity46 science agency the @entity41 , who led one of the studies , said : ' we envision this technology potentially as an initial screen that could complement what is currently used : brain pet imaging , @entity54 imaging , and clinical tests			2
' if further research shows that our initial findings are correct , it could potentially be delivered as part of an individual 's regular eye check - up			2
' the high resolution level of our images could also allow accurate monitoring of individual retinal plaques as a possible method to follow progression and response to therapy			0
' the eye tests exploit the fact that the eye is , in effect , an extension of the brain the eye tests exploit the fact that the eye is , in effect , an extension of the brain			1
in both studies , scientists looked for signs of beta - amyloid protein , which forms clumps in the brains of @entity4 's patients and is a key hallmark of the disease			1
the @entity46 team used the turmeric spice ingredient curcumin as a fluorescent tag that allowed beta - amyloid to show up in the retina			0
a total of 200 volunteers were first asked to take a supplement of curcumin , which binds strongly to beta - amyloid			0
the protein was then detected in the eye using an imaging system			2
levels of beta - amyloid in the retina mirrored those shown in the brain by @entity26 imaging			2
preliminary results on 40 participants showed that the test picked up every participant with @entity4 's and correctly identified more than 80 per cent of those who did not			1
in the other study , researchers from the @entity115 company @entity114 used an ointment to apply a fluorescent label to beta - amyloid in the lens of the eye			2
laser scanning was then able to detect the protein			0
in tests of 40 volunteers with and without @entity4 's , it identified those having the disease with 85 per cent accuracy			1
@entity130 , president and chief executive of @entity114 , said : ' this system shows promise as a technique for early detection and monitoring of the disease			0
' ' these studies provide proof of principle that scanning the eye for amyloid could give us insight about what is going on in the brain ' dr @entity147 , from the charity @entity148 both tests showed that levels of beta - amyloid in the eye mirrored those seen in the brain by @entity26 imaging			1
the results were presented at the @entity156 in @entity157			0
dr @entity147 , head of science at the charity @entity148 , said : ' it is difficult to diagnose alzheimer 's disease accurately and , in many cases , by the time the symptoms have developed , damage has already been going on in the brain for a number of years			2
' the development of a quick , cheap , non-invasive test to detect @entity4 's would be an important step in helping people to receive an early diagnosis , and helping to improve clinical trials so that potential new treatments have the best chance of success			1
' this research is promising but is in the very early stages and involves very small sample sizes			0
' it is too soon to determine whether these types of tests will be useful for diagnosis of dementia and we would need to see the results of larger trials before drawing any firmer conclusions			0
' dr @entity187 , director of research at the @entity189 , said : ' finding new and better ways to detect the early stages of alzheimer 's disease could be a game changer for both future research and for people who will develop the condition			0
' these studies provide proof of principle that scanning the eye for amyloid could give us insight about what is going on in the brain			0
' however as they are only preliminary studies , the eye scans will need further validation before they could be used on people with dementia			0

scientists looked for a protein which forms in the brains of patients
virtually every trial of a drug designed to halt @entity4 's has failed so far
