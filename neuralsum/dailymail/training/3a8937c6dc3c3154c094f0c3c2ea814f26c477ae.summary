it has been reported that @entity1 may have been affected by @entity2 they are two of the most devastating conditions — but the cruel double whammy of both @entity6 ’s and dementia affects around 100,000 @entity8			1
these people have @entity2 symptoms — slow movement and problems with gait — as well as confusion , memory loss , hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia			2
they may get @entity6 ’s first , then develop dementia a year or more later — known as @entity6 ’s dementia			1
or , if dementia is diagnosed before or at the same time as @entity6 ’s symptoms develop , they are said to have ‘ dementia with @entity26 bodies ’ — a type of dementia that shares symptoms with alzheimer ’s disease and @entity6 ’s			1
@entity6 ’s dementia and dementia with @entity26 bodies are the same problem — the difference is the order of the symptoms			1
it ’s been reported that the actor @entity1 might have been affected by this ghastly disorder when he took his life this summer			1
he ’d suffered from @entity6 ’s for three years — then last week a leaked pathologist ’s report revealed there was ‘ diffuse lewy body dementia ’ in his brain			1
lewy bodies are tiny clumps of abnormal proteins produced by the brain when its cells are not working properly			0
they cause memory problems , although these do n’t tend to be as severe as with @entity53 ’s — which is linked to a build - up of the protein beta - amyloid			2
another key difference is that @entity59 dementia affects regions of the brain responsible for vision , causing powerful hallucinations , nightmares and spatial - awareness problems			1
studies suggest that up to 80 per cent of people with @entity6 ’s will develop @entity6 ’s dementia			1
professor @entity68 , clinical director of the charity @entity69 , says : ‘ people with @entity6 ’s will already have @entity26 bodies in the bottom of the brain , which controls movement			1
' in @entity6 ’s dementia , the @entity26 bodies spread up to areas involved in memory , cognition and vision			1
‘ for the patient with dementia with @entity26 bodies , the problem starts at the top of the brain and spreads down — they tend to go to their doctor with cognitive problems , then develop @entity6 ’s or get both simultaneously			1
’ in your 50s , the illness is more likely to start as @entity6 ’s			1
dementia with @entity26 bodies usually affects people in their 70s , says @entity90 , professor of old - age psychiatry at @entity92 and chairman of the @entity94			2
diagnosis is usually via a brain scan that tests for dopamine , a chemical that is lower in people with @entity6 ’s and lewy body dementia			1
symptoms vary — but it ’s a harsh blow for patients , says professor burn			2
her husband @entity105 , 76 , a father - of - three and former supermarket manager , was diagnosed with @entity99 in 2009 , when he was 71			0
up to 80 per cent of people with @entity6 ’s will develop @entity6 ’s dementia ‘ every form of @entity53 ’s is cruel , but i do think this is the cruellest , ’ says @entity104 , 75 , from @entity109			1
‘ @entity105 was such a fit man			0
now he ’s like a baby			2
he ca n’t speak and he ’s so confused he does n’t know me any more			2
’ four years before his diagnosis , @entity105 could n’t move his legs away from the sink while washing up			2
@entity104 then started noticing changes in his behaviour — he would become quiet and expressionless at times			0
a gp diagnosed depression , but antidepressants did n’t help			0
@entity105 went on to develop a shuffling gait , and in 2006 a neurologist diagnosed @entity6 ’s			1
@entity122 helped control those symptoms but in 2009 @entity105 ’s behaviour changed dramatically			2
‘ he became terribly aggressive , ’ says @entity104			0
‘ he ’d wreck the shed looking for a screwdriver			2
he ’d never admit he could n’t remember where it was			2
’ memory tests showed signs of @entity99			0
around this time , @entity105 started having hallucinations , some of which were horrific			0
since his 40s , he ’d suffered with nightmares and restless leg syndrome — the urge to move your legs at night			2
it is thought there may be a link between sleep disturbances and @entity6 ’s and @entity26 bodies			1
the cause of @entity59 dementia is largely unknown but the risk increases with age			0
both lewy body dementia and @entity6 ’s are slightly more common in men			1
patients may be prescribed @entity6 ’s medication and cholinesterase inhibitors , such as @entity153 and @entity154			1
these particularly help with hallucinations , says professor @entity90			0
correct diagnosis is vital , as some @entity6 ’s drugs can worsen hallucinations			1
the proportion of all dementia cases diagnosed as @entity59 dementia although dementia and @entity6 ’s specialists are well aware of @entity145 , gps and the public are less so			1
a @entity167 study found half of patients with @entity99 saw the doctor more than ten times before diagnosis			0
motor symptoms of @entity6 ’s can mask cognitive issues			1
and hallucinations , delusions and movement problems are n’t usually associated with dementia , as @entity179 discovered after her mother @entity180 developed @entity182 body dementia			0
‘ we never thought it could be dementia because of the hallucinations , ’ says @entity179 , 60 , of @entity183			0
@entity180 started seeing things in her early 70s			0
other symptoms included struggling to add up , shuffling , a tremor in her arm and spatial - awareness problems			0
at 80 , she was finally diagnosed with @entity99			0
@entity153 slowed the disease down , but her increasing disorientation is difficult to witness , says @entity179			0
while @entity180 still lives at home , @entity105 moved to a care home in 2011 after a serious fall			0
@entity104 , who is disabled , visits him every week			0
‘ i desperately want to take him home , ’ she says			0
‘ he ’s not the same man i knew but we ’ve still got him			0
