energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs , making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal			1
a damning investigation by consumer champions at which ? found customer service staff were failing to give families clear tariff information a staggering 95 per cent of the time			1
historically , bills have been so complicated that it has been impossible for customers to understand how much gas and electricity they are using and the price per unit			2
a damning investigation by consumer champions at which ? found customer service staff were failing to give families clear tariff information a staggering 95 per cent of the time the industry regulator @entity25 responded in march by introducing a new system requiring energy companies to give a @entity28 ( @entity28 ) for each energy type			1
the @entity28 is similar to an apr for credit cards and tells householders how much a tariff costs per kilowatt hour ( @entity35 ) based on medium usage for both gas and electricity			1
the idea is that householders should be able to ask companies for their @entity28 in order to get some idea as to which offers the lowest bills			1
which ? called 13 energy companies six times each – making a total of 78 – asking them to explain the @entity28 and how it works , however they only managed to provide the correct information on four occasions			1
the consumer group said the calculation to work out the @entity28 is so complicated that it is little better than the old system			1
it involves multiplying the energy unit price by @entity25 ’s average consumption figures – 3,200 kwh for electricity and 13,500 kwh for gas			1
you then add a year ’ s standing charge and subtract any discounts , before adding vat at 20per cent			0
you then divide the figure by 3,200 for electric or 13,500 for gas to give a @entity28 for each energy type in pence per kwh			1
energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs , making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal			1
previous which ? research makes clear the @entity28 system is of little help to customers and it wants @entity25 to require suppliers to adopt a much simpler petrol pump style system for tariffs			1
an earlier study found that just three in ten consumers - 28 per cent - got the right answer when asked to identify the cheapest deal from a range of tariffs using the @entity28			1
this shot up to 84 per cent when people used the simple petrol pump style tariff favoured by which ? the group ’s executive director , @entity94 , said : ‘ if the energy companies ca n’t even explain how to accurately compare tariffs then their customers stand no chance			1
‘ it is clear suppliers need to up their game and ensure they can provide consumers with a clear and accurate explanation to help them find the best deal			2
‘ energy pricing is still far too complicated , which is why we want the government to introduce simpler pricing , similar to petrol pump displays , so people can spot the cheapest deal at a glance			0
’ energy @entity112 , which speaks for suppliers , insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and said an increasing number are shopping around energy @entity112 , which speaks for suppliers , insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and an increasing number are shopping around			2
‘ hundreds of thousands of customers are changing electricity supplier every month and new research from @entity120 has shown that 74 per cent of recent switchers found it easy to change supplier , ’ it said			2
‘ the new tariff comparison rate gives customers an indication of whether they are on the best deal but it is not the only way to compare tariffs			2
' all consumer bills now tell you how much you can save by changing to a different deal with the same supplier			0
' not only that , switching sites offer customers the chance to compare deals from across the market at the click of a button			0
’ it added : ‘ energy deals can not be compared in the same way as petrol pump prices as there are number of additional factors influencing the amount a customer pays			2
' these include the customer ’s location and government legislation which applies to some companies and not others			2
however , this does not mean it is hard to find a good deal			0
‘ energy @entity112 supports transparency and simplicity			0
' hundreds of thousands of people are switching every month			0
there are plenty of deals out there so customers should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier to see if they can save money by switching			0
' energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			1
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
remember , suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
do n't forget , prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

in @entity25 introduced a new system requiring energy companies to give a @entity28 ( @entity28 ) for each energy type to customers
but which ? found customer services failed to give clear tariff information
