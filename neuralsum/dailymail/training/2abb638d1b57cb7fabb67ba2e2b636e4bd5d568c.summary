@entity1 practice : this image was apparently used by @entity4 special forces as a target on a rifle range @entity4 @entity3 used a photograph of @entity11 as target practice during firearms training , the public inquiry into the spy 's death heard yesterday			1
a picture of mr @entity11 's face was apparently riddled with bullet holes after being shot on a rifle range			1
thousands of people in @entity20 were put in grave danger when assassins used a radioactive chemical to launch a ‘ miniature nuclear attack ’ on the dissident @entity4 , the inquiry was told			1
respected judge sir @entity25 said the highly deadly toxin fed to the former @entity28 spy could have been used to ‘ kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public ’			1
on the opening day of the inquiry into his death , the @entity34 heard radioactive traces were found in ‘ large numbers of places ’ after two @entity4 hitmen laced mr @entity11 ’s tea with a lethal dose polonium - 210 at a @entity46 hotel			1
biochemical experts found a teapot at the @entity49 in the @entity50 in @entity51 with readings for polonium - 210 which were off the charts			1
aim : this video shows how @entity3 used a series of photographs while conducting firearms training killed : @entity11 , pictured in hospital in november 2006 , died from radiation poisoning family : @entity11 pictured outside the hearing with her son @entity62 on the inquiry 's first day history : @entity11 pictured with his wife @entity65 ( left ) and son @entity62 in @entity46 in 2000 a public health alert was quickly issued after traces of the toxin – worth ‘ tens of millions of dollars ’ – were found in offices , homes , hotels and on planes across the capital and beyond			1
a lethal dose of the highly radioactive chemical is 50 nanograms – one billionth of a gram – which means just one gram would be potentially enough to kill 100 million people			0
@entity80 , counsel to the public inquiry , said : ‘ many thousands of members of the public , including @entity20 residents and visitors from overseas , might have been at risk from radioactivity			1
’ sir @entity25 described the killing as ‘ a miniature nuclear attack on the streets of @entity46 ’			2
after his death , mr @entity11 ’s body had to be placed in a lead - lined coffin to prevent radiation from seeping out of his grave in @entity97 in north @entity46			1
hearing : a public inquiry chaired by sir @entity25 , pictured , has started at the @entity34 evidence : @entity80 , pictured , said that @entity11 's poisoning had sparked a massive health alert widow : @entity11 has been seeking justice for her husband 's death for more than eight years accusation : @entity105 , for @entity11 , called @entity106 a ' mafia state ' part of the evidence at the inquiry into @entity11 ’s assassination will be heard in secret			1
some witnesses will give evidence from behind a screen while others will be given complete secrecy to protect their links to the security services			0
and part of judge sir @entity25 ’s final report at the end of the multimillion - pound public inquiry ‘ will have to remain secret ’ to protect the sensitive evidence			1
even mr @entity11 ’s wife @entity65 will not be allowed to see the secret parts of the judge ’s report			2
on the first day of the hearing yesterday , the court heard that the spy was being paid by the @entity20 security services in return for information on the @entity4 mafia			2
but the @entity137 has always said it can ‘ neither confirm nor deny ’ that mr @entity11 was employed by @entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140			2
@entity141 , representing the @entity137 , told the court that this policy would continue			0
he said : ‘ there will be allegations that individuals were agents for those organisations or worked for them			0
the work of those agencies requires secrecy and there is a need to preserve that			0
’ however sir @entity25 said that if evidence emerged which suggested @entity20 agents could have prevented his death , he would consider allowing it to be heard during the inquiry			1
the fatal attack in november 2006 was the second time that assassins had tried to kill him in the @entity20 using polonium - 210 , mr @entity163 also revealed			2
weeks earlier , the spy recalled feeling unwell around the time of a meeting at a security company in mid-october and told of ‘ vomiting on one occasion about two or three weeks before being hospitalised ’			2
‘ hair samples indicate mr @entity11 may well have been poisoned twice and the first occasion being much less severe than the second , ’ mr @entity163 said			1
the court heard how the 43 - year - old was poisoned by former @entity28 bodyguard @entity174 and @entity175 for his public opposition to @entity106			1
after drinking the poisoned tea at the hotel , he went home on a bus in @entity46 and soon started to feel unwell			1
he spent 23 days in hospital in agonising pain as his strength left him and his organs began to fail			0
his final few days were spent in isolation in @entity186			0
it was then the haunting photo of him wearing a green hospital gown , his hair having fallen out through radiation poisoning , was taken			1
meeting : mr @entity11 was apparently poisoned at the @entity50 in @entity51 , pictured couple : the spy , left , fled to @entity20 with his wife @entity65 , right , after becoming an opponent of @entity106 chairman : sir @entity25 's inquiry comes more than eight years after @entity11 's death @entity105 , representing the @entity11 family , said : ‘ the murder was an act of unspeakable barbarism that inflicted on @entity11 the most painful and lingering death imaginable			1
‘ mr @entity11 came to realise he was bound to die , and that he had been the victim of a political assassination by the @entity4 state			2
’ medical experts only established the precise nature of the rare poison that was killing him two days before his death			0
they initially thought he had been given a dose of thallium			0
however , he was given such a huge dose of polonium - 210 experts believe he could not have been saved even with a prompt diagnosis			0
while alpha radiation emitted by polonium can not pass through skin , when ingested it will fatally damage internal organs – known as acute radiation syndrome			2
@entity219 is an exceptionally rare element , with only around 100g produced every year			0
mr @entity221 told the court the quantity given to mr @entity11 was worth ‘ tens of millions of dollars ’			1
he added : ‘ it is , we say , unlikely in the extreme any private individual or purely criminal enterprise would choose such a costly method of assassination			0
‘ for the @entity4 state , however , which produces polonium - 210 itself , the costs of the assassination would not be prohibitive			0
’ @entity174 and @entity175 brought the chemical to the @entity20 on flights from @entity4 to @entity46 in october , he said			2
the multi-million inquiry into mr @entity11 ’s death will hear from some 70 witnesses and is expected to last ten weeks			1
sir @entity25 , its chairman , said sensitive evidence had established there is a ‘ prima facie case ’ as to the culpability of the @entity4 state ’s involvement			0
suspects : @entity175 , left , and @entity174 , right , have been accused of killing @entity11 speaking out : mr @entity11 , right , at a 1998 press conference in which he and secret service colleagues publicly denounced their boss @entity106 @entity106 was accused of being a ‘ common criminal dressed up as a head of state ’ by the barrister representing @entity11 ’s family			2
@entity105 said the dissident became a ‘ marked man ’ after he attempted to expose a plot by the @entity4 intelligence service – the @entity257 – to kill billionaire @entity258 in 1998			0
he further ‘ antagonised ’ his former @entity257 boss @entity106 by writing two books , and was killed on his direct orders , mr @entity221 claimed			0
the first of mr @entity11 ’s publications alleged the agency bombed apartment blocks which were then blamed on @entity268 rebels to trigger a conflict , while a second implicated the @entity257 in @entity4 mafia operations			2
the dissident became a ' marked man ' after antangonising his former boss @entity106 ( pictured ) , mr @entity11 's lawyer claimed mr @entity11 ’s claims did ‘ considerable damage ’ to the @entity257 ’s reputation – after the initial book ‘ @entity277 ’ was published			0
the dissident also criticised @entity106 ’s regime on tv and elsewhere in public , including blaming the state for the murder of @entity4 journalist @entity286			0
and at the time of his death , mr @entity11 – who had defected and was working for @entity139 – was due to give evidence in a @entity291 trial which could have exposed links between @entity106 and organised crime , mr @entity221 said			1
a day after mr @entity11 died in 2006 , one politician told a debate in the @entity4 duma : ‘ the traitor received the punishment he deserved			1
’ mr @entity221 said : ‘ he had broken the culture of silence about the inner workings of the @entity257			0
experts on the @entity4 state have suggested that he was a marked man from that moment onwards			0
’ mr @entity221 , representing mr @entity11 ’s wife @entity65 and son @entity62 , said a plan was hatched at the highest level to ‘ punish him lethally for breaking ranks ’			0
‘ it was really only a question of how long it would take and what means would eventually be devised to deliver the fatal blow , ’ mr @entity221 said , adding : ‘ @entity4 security services could not have carried out the assassination without mr @entity106 ’s direct approval , given mr @entity106 ’s known attention to detail in such matters			0
‘ we say that when all the open and closed evidence is considered together mr @entity11 ’s dying declaration will be borne out as true – the trail of polonium leads not only from @entity46 to @entity325 but directly to the door of mr @entity106 ’s office – and that @entity106 should be unmasked by this inquiry as nothing more or less than a common criminal dressed up as a head of state			1
’ the inquiry was read transcripts of interviews given by mr @entity11 to police on his deathbed , in which he attacked members of the @entity339 group of industrialised nations , including @entity341 , for legitimising the @entity106 regime			1
he also blamed @entity106 for the polonium attack , telling police : ‘ the order could only have been given by one person – the president of the @entity4 , @entity106			0
’ mr @entity221 said : ‘ @entity106 was a ruthless and deadly enemy			0
