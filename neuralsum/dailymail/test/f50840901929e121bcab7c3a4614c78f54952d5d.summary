the @entity8 star has devoted hours on the training field to mastering the art of the perfect set - piece , but even the best in the business occasionally get it wrong			0
in the white - hot atmosphere of the @entity17 prior to wednesday night 's second - leg @entity19 quarter - final , when every minute of preparation is key , there was still time for @entity0 to display a small but heartfelt act of kindness			1
@entity0 shows his delight after @entity4 finally broke the deadlock against rivals @entity5 but it was a different story before the game as @entity0 expressed his concern after his shot hit a supporter after completing his warm - up routine @entity0 went over to the touchline and lifted off his training shirt after receiving the forward 's shirt the young supporter was clearly overcome with emotion at the kind act as the former @entity40 forward trained his sights with long - range attempts , one effort flew wide of the target and into the crowd , striking a young supporter in the front row			1

in a classy gesture , @entity0 offered the young boy the warm - up garment as a consolation for being on the receiving end of his venomous shot			2
unsurprisingly , the young @entity66 was star - struck by the warm deed , becoming teary - eyed at the unexpected turn of events			0
