by @entity0 last updated at 4:20 pm on 16th january 2012 deputy prime minister @entity1 has blasted @entity3 's suggestion that the @entity4 should receive a new @entity5 as a gift in recognition of her @entity8			1
mr @entity3 , the @entity9 , made the suggestion in a letter to mr @entity1 and culture secretary @entity12 , who is overseeing the celebrations			1
in it , mr @entity3 said the celebrations ' should go beyond those of previous jubilees and mark the greater achievement that the diamond anniversary represents '			2
but he has been forced to defend himself today after mr @entity1 dismissed the extravagance because hard - up voters do n't want to see a debate between ' the haves and have - yachts			1
' @entity4 's pride and joy : @entity3 wants a replacement for the @entity28 in recognition of the @entity8 how it might look : an artist 's impression of the as yet unnamed vessel that could be the future flagship of the @entity34 the deputy prime minister said : ' most people in the country would think the diamond jubilee is a wonderful occasion for us to celebrate together as a community and as a nation			1
' but i suspect that most people in the country would think , given that there is very little money around , that this probably would not be the top of their list of priorities for the use of scarce public resources			1
' he joked that it was a case of ' the haves and the have yachts ' - before apologising for the poor quality of his quip			0
last year the @entity60 launched a campaign for an £ 80million majestic new @entity5 to replace @entity28 – but one which is funded by donations , rather than by the taxpayer			0
today @entity64 also said that public money should not be used to pay for a new @entity5			1
mr @entity64 's spokesman said : ' clearly there is a difficult economic situation , there are scarce resources , and therefore we do n't think it would be an appropriate use of public money at the present time			1
' calls : mr @entity3 , left , wrote a private letter to culture secretary @entity12 to say that he felt the @entity4 , pictured attending a church service yesterday , should be given a new @entity5 as a lasting legacy to her reign as monarch @entity82 deputy chairman @entity81 said : ' we 're all looking forward to the diamond jubilee			1
the significance of the occasion should be celebrated across the country			0
' but @entity3 has shown he is out of touch with this proposal			2
' when school budgets are being slashed , parents will be wondering how @entity3 came even to suggest this idea			1
this is not the time to spend £ 60 million on a yacht			2
' but mr @entity3 , stung by the criticism , said today in the @entity97 that he did not intend for public money to be used for the vessel			1
how the @entity60 launched its campaign for a new royal yacht for the @entity102 ' the letter which i wrote to the prime minister on september 12 clearly stated that i agree of course the project for a royal yacht , the future ship project for the 21st century , was one - and i was quite clear in my letter - where no public funding should be provided , ' said mr @entity3			1
according to @entity113 , the leaked letter was addressed to mr @entity1 and culture secretary @entity12 and said that a private donation could be sought if insufficient taxpayer funds were available			2
the @entity28 was decommissioned by the @entity82 government in december 1997 – following an initial decision by @entity119 ’s government – and was the only time the @entity4 has been seen to cry in public			1
former @entity123 foreign secretary @entity122 has described the decision to decommission the yacht as the greatest mistake of @entity119 ’s time in power			2
@entity28 is now a visitor attraction in @entity129 and was moved to a dry dock earlier this month after it began taking on water due to a faulty door seal			0
the new vessel proposed by the @entity60 would have £ 80million construction costs and would be funded by donations from individuals and corporations			0
the 21st century successor to @entity28 would be in keeping with @entity34 ’s historic role as a great maritime nation			0
codenamed @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , the 515ft four - masted ship would incorporate the very latest materials and technology			0
the plans include royal quarters and state rooms for grand diplomatic and corporate events			0
run by a charitable trust , it would cover its own costs — through everything from trade exhibitions to training sea cadets			0
the new ship would require teams of young people , known as ‘ @entity4 ’s cadets ’ , to clamber aloft in all weathers to keep it going			0
the 412 - foot @entity28 was launched in april 1953 at @entity162 ’s @entity161 and served the @entity4 for 44 years , carrying her and the @entity163 on 968 official voyages			2
it travelled 1,087,623 nautical miles , calling at more than 600 ports in 135 countries			0
prince @entity167 and princess @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and the @entity171 and @entity172 all honeymooned on it and last july @entity174 and @entity176 rugby star @entity175 hosted a pre-wedding party on board the vessel which was attended by @entity180 and @entity181 and the @entity182			0
the ship is now owned by @entity184 , a charitable organisation whose sole remit is the maintenance of @entity28 in keeping with its former role .			0

@entity3 says @entity4 should be given gift as a mark of *respect* and to lift the country 's spirits
@entity64 says new yacht would not be ' an appropriate use of public money at this time '
@entity1 dismisses calls because new boat for @entity4 is ' not top of list of priorities ' for cash - strapped voters
@entity82 says letter shows @entity3 is ' out of touch ' as school budgets are being slashed
@entity3 defends himself , *declaring* he did n't say taxpayers ' money should be used for the project
