by @entity0 the next time the @entity3 military transport plane known as @entity4 drops its paratroopers over @entity6 , @entity7 , it will be for a commemoration instead of an invasion			1
seventy years after taking part in d - day , the plane now housed at the @entity13 in western @entity14 is being prepared to recreate its role in the mission , when it dropped troops behind enemy lines under @entity20 fire			1
at the invitation of the @entity7 government , the restored @entity21 will fly in for 70th - anniversary festivities and again release paratroopers over the original jump zone at @entity27			1
going home : whiskey 7 , a warplane that took part in the @entity12 invasion of @entity6 , is set to return to @entity7 to participate in the 70 - year anniversary celebration relic : whiskey 7 is currently housed at the @entity13 in western @entity14 ' there are very few of these planes still flying , and this plane was very significant on d - day , ' said @entity39 , chairwoman of the @entity40 to @entity41			1
' it dropped people that were some of the first into @entity27 and liberated that town			1
' museum officials say the twin - prop whiskey 7 , so named because of its w - 7 squadron marking , is one of several c - 47s scheduled to be part of the @entity12 anniversary , with jumpers made up of active and retired military personnel			1
but it is believed to be the only one flying from the @entity3			1
the plane will fly to @entity7 by way of @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity20 , each leg 5 ½ to 7 hours			1
@entity39 compared it to trying to drive a 70 - year - old car across the country without a breakdown			1
" it 's going to be a huge challenge			1
" among the 21 men it carried in 1944 was 20 - year - old @entity72 , who also will make the return trip to @entity7 , his fifth , and be reunited with the craft — once it 's on the ground			1
he is flying commercially from his @entity77 , @entity78 , home outside @entity79			1
whiskey 7 dropped 21 men behind enemy lines during the @entity83 , helping to liberate the town of @entity27			1
above , boats storm the @entity87 shore @entity89 crew members pose in front of a @entity21 in september 1944 - the same type of warplane as @entity4 ' with me , it 's almost , sometimes , like yesterday , ' @entity72 , now 89 , said by phone , recalling his first combat mission			1
' it really never leaves you			2
' although the @entity21 looks much the same today as it did on june 6 , 1944 , it looked very different when it arrived at the museum as a donation eight years ago			2
it had been converted to a corporate passenger plane			2
' we had to take an executive interior out , ' said the museum 's president , @entity106			2
' it had a dry bar , lounge seats , a table with a nice map of the @entity113 in there			2
' the museum 's restoration of the historic plane to its original condition has been a roughly $ 180,000 project so far			2
most of the money went toward two rebuilt engines and the rest to parts , equipment and service			2
the museum is trying to raise a total of $ 250,000 for the restoration and return to @entity6			2
one upgrade it did allow was the installation of two gps systems to keep the aircraft on course			2
' the avionics in the airplane are modern			0
we 're not going to go with what they had in 1943 , ' @entity106 said			0
' they would have had probably a radio beacon receiver and a lot of dead reckoning			0
' there is still no autopilot , said @entity106 's daughter , @entity148 , who will be among five pilots — one including her brother , @entity150 — taking turns at the controls on the way to @entity154			0
that 's fine with her , she said			0
in the cockpit : @entity157 ( pictured ) will be one of five pilots taking the plane back to @entity7 getting ready for the journey : @entity106 stands outside the plane at the museum			0
so far the museum has spent some $ 180,000 to restore the plane for its upcoming flight replaced : the museum has rebuilt the plane 's two engines ' it 's history			0
it 's real flying , ' she said			0
' with a lot of the computerized , mechanized things that you see in the airliners today , the airplane basically flies itself			0
... this is not a situation where you can be asleep at the wheel			0
you really have to pay attention			0
' said her father , also a pilot : ' you do n't just grab something and push it			0
there 's a kind of feel to everything you do in these old birds			0
it does n't have a soul obviously , but you do n't just tell it what to do			0
' @entity72 still remembers being squashed between other paratroopers seated on pan seats as the plane left @entity198 's @entity197			1
he was weighed down with probably 100 pounds of gear , including an m - 1 rifle that was carried in three pieces , 30 - caliber rifle ammo , a first - aid pack , grenade , k - rations and his @entity206 in his left pocket , over his heart			1
whiskey 7 will again drop paratroopers over @entity7			1
above a similar ceremony held on the 66th anniversary of d - day a @entity3 paratrooper packs his parachute after jumping over @entity27 , @entity6 , western @entity7 , on june 3 , 2012 , during the ceremonies of the the @entity12 's 66th anniversary " we could hear the louder roar as each plane following the leader accelerated down the runway and lifted into the air , " he wrote in an account of the mission			1
' our turn came and the quivering craft gathered momentum along the path right behind the plane in front			0
' the airplane 's engines were so loud he had to shout even to talk with the paratrooper next to him , he said , and the scenery through its square windows looked like shadows in the dark			0
over the @entity241 , a colonel pointed downward			0
' in the partial darkness below we could make out silhouetted shapes of ships and there must have been thousands of them all sizes and kinds , ' @entity72 wrote			0
' if we had any doubts before about the certainty of the invasion , they were dispelled now			0

at the ceremony , warplane @entity4 will again drop paratroopers near the town of @entity259 - @entity27
