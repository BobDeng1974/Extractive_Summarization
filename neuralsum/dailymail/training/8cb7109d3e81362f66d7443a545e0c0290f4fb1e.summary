by @entity0 proved wrong : @entity3 's entire election strategy hinges on the cost of living , which is now affordable , figures show @entity3 faces a fresh crisis as his ‘ cost of living card ’ evaporates ahead of the election			1
figures out later this week are expected to show that pay rises are now outstripping inflation for the first time in six years			1
this means @entity15 ’s entire election strategy – to blame the @entity16 for presiding over a ‘ cost of living crisis ’ – will effectively become redundant			1
at the weekend chancellor @entity18 used a speech in the @entity20 to crow that @entity15 were ‘ wrong about the past and they are wrong about the future ’			1
and deputy prime minister @entity24 used his monthly press conference to lambast @entity15 for having created the squeeze on living standards in the first place by ‘ crashing ’ the economy			2
mr @entity3 faced further criticism yesterday from @entity31 , a former @entity15 health secretary , who called on the party to court business if it has any hope of winning the election			1
writing in the @entity36 , mr @entity31 said @entity15 needed to ‘ embrace an avowedly pro-business agenda and match it with a more pro-business tone ’			2
economic figures are expected to show that inflation has fallen from 1.7 per cent in february to 1.5 per cent in march ; while growth in weekly earnings has risen from 1.4 per cent to 1.8 per cent			1
if it is confirmed that wages are rising faster than the cost of living , this will mean @entity47 will feel like they have more money in their pockets – and will be less likely to listen to @entity15 ’s warnings			2
mr @entity24 said @entity15 had been proved wrong time and time again since the last election , and will have nothing left to say at the election if their ‘ cost of living crisis ’ line is proved wrong			1
‘ first they said making cuts and saving was not necessary – a remarkable thing to say when you had the largest peacetime deficit in this country ever and the largest structural deficit anywhere in the developed world , ’ mr @entity24 said			0
‘ then they said that by imposing savings , that was going to stop growth			0
then they said that a million more people were going to be unemployed – every single one of those allegations by the @entity15 has fallen by the wayside and has proved to be wrong			2
it comes as @entity18 told a @entity20 audience @entity15 was ' wrong about the past and is wrong about the future ' ‘ and if this latest suggestion from the @entity15 that somehow living standards will somehow never improve again also proves to be wrong , what on earth does the @entity15 have to say on the most central issue of the day – namely how we manage our economy , come may of next year			0
’ mr @entity24 said the reason why there had been a squeeze in living standards was that @entity47 had ‘ suffered the largest cardiac arrest in our economy ’ since the 1973 oil crisis			0
‘ i find it remarkable that in addition to denying any responsibility for the crash in the first place , they are denying any kind of maturity in accepting that you need to take difficult decisions to clean up the mess that was created by the @entity15 in the first place , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity15 have then gone on to somehow claim that the pressure on people ’s living expenses had got nothing to do with them either			0
‘ i just think this consistent abdication of responsibility ; this persistent refusal to apologise for having crashed the economy in the first place … shows a real paucity of credibility on the economy			0
‘ as people ’s living standards improve and the pressure on living standards is eased , i wonder what is left for @entity15			0

pay rises now outstripping inflation for first time in 6 years , figures show
means @entity3 's entire election strategy is effectively redundant
comes as @entity15 leader faces criticism from all parties for *outlook*
former @entity15 health secretary said leader is failing to court businesses
