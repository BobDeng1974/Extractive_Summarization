@entity0 continued his run of good form as the @entity4 doubles expert and @entity5 cruised through to the third round of the @entity7 on friday			1
@entity0 and @entity5 needed just 64 minutes to book their place in the last 16 of the men 's doubles as they saw off the home pairing of @entity14 and @entity15 6 - 2 , 6 - 3			1
@entity0 said : ' we played a good match from start to finish			0
it was nice to get through without any hairy moments , unlike the other day , and kind of feel good about our chances going into our next match			0
' @entity0 ( right ) and @entity5 eased into the third round of the @entity7 @entity0 celebrates his win as he continues his fine start to 2015 in the doubles the @entity4 / @entity29 combination of @entity0 and @entity30 have shown promising signs at the start of this year after winning the @entity33 two weeks ago			1
although the 2015 season is admittedly still young , @entity0 and @entity5 currently sit fourth in the @entity36 rankings , with the top eight qualifying for the season - ending finals at the @entity39 in @entity40			2
the first @entity41 of the year in @entity42 offers a good opportunity to notch up plenty of ranking points towards @entity40 , the pair already earning 180 for their run here			0
@entity0 and @entity5 , the no 16 seeds , dominated from the off and two breaks saw them claim the opening set , during which they made just one unforced error			2
although @entity55 and @entity15 stepped up their game in the second set , the regular pairing of @entity0 and @entity5 were too strong and wrapped up the match with the minimum of fuss			1
after having a whole host of different partners through the years , @entity0 is now reaping the benefits of having a long - term steady partnership with @entity5			0
@entity0 , 28 , said : ' this is our third year now , i think it ’s probably quite a long - term partnership currently on the tour			0
as usual guys chopped and changed at the end of last year , which is an advantage for us i think , being longer together			0
@entity76 was in the crowd to cheer on her son ahead of @entity80 's match later in the day @entity0 was also cheered on by a small @entity82 contingent as extended his stay in @entity42 ' i think we both made quite a few improvements in the off - season actually , various parts of our games , and that showed in the way we played in @entity89 as well and in the first two matches here			1
' we ’re happy , we ’re feeling good about where our games are at and we ’re looking forward to the next round			0
' the pair face a potential tough third - round match against no 4 seeds @entity97 and @entity98 , while @entity0 has also entered the mixed doubles with @entity101 's @entity100			2
@entity102 also joined fellow @entity103 in the third round as he teamed up with @entity106 @entity105 for a 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 victory against @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity102 and @entity105 , seeded no 14 , could meet top seeds @entity113 and @entity114 next if the @entity112 pair beat @entity115 and @entity116 on saturday			0
@entity117 's @entity7 is over , however , after she and @entity119 partner @entity118 lost 6 - 0 , 6 - 2 to 12th seeds @entity120 and @entity122 in the women 's doubles .			1

@entity0 and @entity5 eased into the third round in @entity42
the doubles pair have made a fine start to the year
they beat @entity14 and @entity15 6 - 2 , 6 - 3
