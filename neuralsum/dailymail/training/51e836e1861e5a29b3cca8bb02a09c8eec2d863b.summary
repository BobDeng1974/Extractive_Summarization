by @entity0 a former primary school teacher hanged herself after her ' meticulous ' and ' perfectionist ' nature left her struggling to cope with both work and her family life , an inquest heard			1
@entity7 , 32 , was so conscientious she quit her job after putting herself under undue stress due to the pressures of her workload			1
her mental state then worsened after she had a baby with her husband @entity14 and her life ' spiralled out of control ' when the couple split up and the boy went to live with his father			1
former primary school teacher @entity7 made detailed handwritten notes on how to hang herself shortly before she took her own life ms @entity7 had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was receiving treatment for her condition at the time of her death			1
her body was found at her home in @entity29 , @entity30 by her father @entity31 and his partner @entity32			1
@entity7 resigned her job as a primary school teacher because she struggled to cope with the pressure an inquest at @entity37 was told @entity38 educated ms @entity7 had suffered with anorexia following her mother ’s death when she was 13 which she had ' taken quite deeply '			1
after graduating , she trained to be a teacher and got a job as a primary school but left and later got a promotions job within the @entity47			2
mr @entity31 told the hearing : ' she was very close to her mother probably closer than she was to me			1
she probably hid it quite well really but it did affect her quite deeply			0
she suffered from anorexia probably partly caused by that			2
' she was a very meticulous girl and if anything , overprepared			0
she was very good at what she did and the school started to put more onus on her because she was capable of it			0
in the end she could n’t cope with the additional pressure			0
' i knew @entity7 was very , very keen to be a mother			1
it ’s fair to say that we were n’t totally convinced it was a wise decision probably because of her mental health and putting more pressure on herself			1
' the couple went on to have a little boy but almost immediately after his birth she became unwell again			2
she was admitted to the @entity72 and @entity73 where she remained for around eight weeks			0
ms @entity7 split from her husband @entity14 soon after giving birth to their son because of her illness mr @entity31 told the inquest he and his son - in - law visited mrs @entity7 virtually every day			1
but the couple later split and their son lived with @entity14 and and following a change in medication she was admitted to @entity85 at @entity86			1
mr @entity31 told the inquest his daughter ’s mental health was ' fluctuating ' but she was discharged under his care to live with him			1
she then moved into a flat by herself just half a mile away from her father			2
he added : ' very occasionally , sometimes she would be very low but we thought we could convince her there was still a positive future for her			0
she did n’t give any indication that she would take her life , it was n’t of any great concern			2
' it was one of the things that was in the back of your mind but not an immediate threat			0
' bipolar disorder was previously known as manic depression and can cause extreme mood swings			1
approximately one person in one hundred is at risk of developing the condition			0
sufferers can experience episodes of deep depression followed by intense mania			0
the condition 's symptoms depend on whether the patient is suffering depression or experiencing mania			2
often these episodes can last for several weeks or longer			0
in many cases a patient may only feel ' normal ' for very short periods			0
it is very important for someone at risk of bipolar disorder to get a correct diagnosis as patients during depressive episodes may decide , like @entity132 ( right ) to take their own life			1
often a patient will be diagnosed with clinical depression first before doctors identify the manic element of the illness			2
anyone experiencing symptoms of depression and are considering harming themselves should contact their gp immediately or the @entity145			0
during manic episodes a patient may feel very happy and can even go on spending sprees on goods that they do not need			0
the mania can also prevent a patient from eating or sleeping properly			0
there are a range of treatment options available for sufferers including long - term medication to counter the mood swings			2
also patients can learn how to identify early warning signs of either depression or mania and seek appropriate help in time			0
some patients also benefit from psychological treatment and therapy to counter depression			0
also , regular exercise is thought to help with the symptoms			0
source : @entity171 the hearing was told ms @entity7 had returned to work due after her condition improved but this soon changed			1
community psychiatric nurse @entity176 said : ' she was enjoying being back at work and she was glad that she was achieving things again			1
initially when she went back to work she was coping			0
' i was on leave just prior to her death and her mood fluctuated again and she started to have worries about work , feeling that she was n’t doing her job properly and she was actually on sick leave			2
' @entity186 had noticed changes , first she was aiming high and then struggling			0
with @entity7 being so conscientious , we had done some triggers for her to look out for			1
' she added : ' @entity7 was a bit of an open book in respect of the way she looked , she looked very worried all the time almost like a rabbit caught in headlights , she had that look about her			1
' i think like her dad said , it was always in the back of your mind the possibility that it would come to this and we were putting everything in place			0
' but she always said to me that she would never do anything to harm herself because she would never do that to her dad and family			2
' mrs @entity176 said that ms @entity7 had a planned appointment with the team on wednesday , december 11 last year yet received a phone call from a worried colleague who had n’t been able to contact her			1
she then contacted mrs @entity7 ’s dad and she , together with his partner , @entity32 , entered @entity7 ’s flat where they found her body			1
a note addressed to ' @entity219 and @entity32 ' was found as well as an @entity221 notepad open on her bed with detailed handwritten notes about how to hang herself			1
coroner @entity224 concluded mrs @entity7 took her own life and said : ' clearly @entity7 has had a troubled life as far as her health was concerned , starting i ’m sure with the death of her mother when she was only 13			1
' she started a career in teaching but appears to have struggled to cope and eventually left that and went into the health service			1
' she met and married @entity14 and they had a child but the relationship deteriorated			2
she was a perfectionist and conscientious , maybe she was hoping to get by on her own steam			0
' there became a time when she broke down , her child had been placed with his father			2
. things were spiralling downwards it would seem , until she was found at the flat			0
' while it clearly came as a shock it was not the greatest surprise			0
