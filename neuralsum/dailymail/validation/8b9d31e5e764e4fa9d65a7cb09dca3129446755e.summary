a teenager has been diagnosed with depression after she was hit with a whopping £ 5,000 holiday phone bill			1
@entity3 , 17 , visited @entity4 with her family for eight days and mistakenly thought she had a £ 120 limit on her contract with @entity8			1
but when the shop worker , from @entity10 , @entity11 , returned home she was horrified when her mother @entity14 - whose name was on the contract - received a £ 4,908.69 bill			1
distraught @entity3 - whose family ca n't afford the repayments - felt so guilty about the bill she went to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants			1
@entity3 , 17 , pictured with her mother @entity23 , after she ran up a £ 5,000 phone bill in @entity4 mother mrs @entity3 , 51 , said : ' my daughter has had to go on anti-depressants since she got the bill			1
it has really affected her			0
' she 's been really upset			0
she did n't realise that this was happening			0
the contract is in my name and she feels guilty			0
' you do n't expect your 17 - year - old daughter to be on anti-depressants			1
' @entity3 is really worried that we wo n't be able to pay it back and the bailiffs will be round			1
' they said we can pay £ 100 a month			1
we ca n't afford it			0
we could maybe afford £ 50 , but that would take years			2
i think they could do more			0
' i do n't know what to do			0
i 've cried , i 've been angry			0
what the hell will i do ? the family flew to @entity48 , @entity4 , for a @entity50 holiday on december 22 and @entity3 thought she was using the hotel @entity51 to keep in touch with friends on @entity55			1
she was sent a text asking if she wanted to increase her bill limit to £ 120 - or 200mb of data - and she agreed			1
the family headed to @entity48 , @entity4 for a @entity50 holiday and @entity3 chatted with her friends @entity3 , pictured with her mother and her mother 's partner @entity63 ( right ) , thought her bill was capped at £ 120 but when she got a second text later to say she had reached that limit , she agreed to remove the data restriction , mistakenly thinking she still could n't go above £ 120			1
she thought the bill would be more than covered by the £ 200 she set aside before her holiday , so was astonished to return home to a £ 3,704.34 bill on january 2			1
however , not all data she used on her @entity74 6 to browse the web and @entity55 was included in the first bill , and it was upped to £ 4,908.69 on february 27			1
@entity3 is now taking anti-depressant citalopram every day and is nervous the bill will tear the family apart			2
mrs @entity3 , an administrator , who was on holiday with her partner and his son , added : ' if i had known i would have told her to stop			2
@entity3 thought she was still within the £ 120			2
' i just got an email to say the bill was £ 3704.34			2
' they put it up in february			2
they said they had n't included everything in the january bill			0
when i rang in january saying i needed help they said ' unlucky '			0
' i was ringing them every day			0
how do you bill for something in january and then again in february ? ' she had set aside £ 200 for her bill while she was abroad , but the family now face years of paying it off since the huge bill was sent , @entity8 has slightly dropped the cost to £ 3,191.97 as a gesture of goodwill			1
a company spokesperson said : ' to help protect customers from higher costs charged by overseas networks we cap data usage at £ 40			2
' customers need to tell us if they want to increase this limit and confirm to us again if they want the cap removed completely			0
' we received two separate notifications from ms @entity3 's mobile asking us to do just that			0
' we are clear with customers on the cost of overseas charges and would always advise customers to think carefully before choosing to remove the usage caps			0
