by @entity1 reporter published : 15:42 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 08:02 est , 12 january 2014 if you live in the @entity4 or @entity5 , you may want to hold off on putting away your winter gear			2
just as temperatures are beginning to warm in much of the @entity11 , another arctic blast in the form of a polar vortex appears to be on the horizon			0
the upcoming front of icy temperatures is expected to bring arctic air to southern @entity16 and then move into the northern plains of the @entity11 before moving to the @entity4 and @entity5 - each of which is still recovering from last week 's frigid temperatures			1
blocked : ice piles up on the @entity22 near @entity23 , @entity24 , on saturday , causing flooding @entity26 takes photos of the frozen @entity22 on saturday , where the build up of ice is causing a flood risk mist rises from the @entity22 as chunks of ice ride up near @entity23 , @entity24 at the weekend many areas are still recovering from the extreme weather last week , which has caused a dam of ice to block the @entity22 in @entity24 , forcing roads to close and causing a severe flood risk			2
a @entity42 ice cutter has been called in to try to clear shipping lanes but after 2 and half miles the 2ft ice had become to thick to break up			0
chunks of ice have been building up for days near the @entity49 , @entity46 reported			0
but with the sudden warm temperatures , it is feared a fast thaw will flood low - lying areas			2
' if in fact the ice jam breaks then we 'll have a rush of water which could cause flash flooding , ' @entity54 , of @entity55 , said			0
flash flood warnings are in place in several of the regions affected by the polar vortex , as rain falling on the already frozen ground is forced to run off			0
nearly all of @entity69 is under a flood warning after the sudden rise in temperatures caused a faster than usual thaw			0
a chaotic scene of ice chunks could be seen stretching across the state 's @entity76 near @entity78 on saturday morning			0
but the thaw is likely to be halted by the new cold front coming in , even though it is not expected to be as severe as the one last week			1
a train can be seen passing over the ice - packed @entity22 in @entity24 at the weekend @entity83 looks across the ice - filled @entity76 , near @entity78 in @entity69 on saturday bundle up : another blast of arctic air is expected to hit the @entity11 next week - despite mild temperatures over the weekend frozen : @entity90 air from last week 's @entity91 caused many parts of the @entity93 to freeze over ' following the retreat of arctic air this weekend , waves of progressively colder will move southward over @entity16 next week , ' @entity94 told @entity98			1
forecasters expect the first stage of the new arctic blast to hit the northern plains by monday , the lower @entity103 and @entity4 tuesday and wednesday then the @entity5 from thursday			1
like the last bout of icy air , this one is the result of a portion of the polar vortex breaking away from the @entity110			0
' we will likely see a piece of the polar vortex break off and set up just north of the @entity93 spanning jan. 16 to 20 , ' mr @entity111 said			2
' this next main arctic blast will not rival , nor will be as extensive as the event this past week , ' he continued			0
unlike the last push of cold air , weather experts expect temperatures to stay above zero in most locations in the @entity122 , @entity123 , the @entity124 and the @entity125			1
weather maps for the middle of next week show the polar vortex creeping back across the @entity11 the polar vortex last week was so cold that @entity130 froze in an incredibly rare occurrence @entity133 states and states in the @entity135 , however , are expected to see temperatures at or below zero			1
additionally , anyone near the @entity93 should also expect lake - effect snow			1
weather experts expect to have more information about the upcoming cold next week .			1

experts do *n't* expect temperatures as severe as last week 's chill
new cold - front is expected to hit the @entity5 on thursday
most of the country 's temperatures will remain above zero degree - unlike the last @entity91
*cities* near the @entity93 should expect lake - effect snow
