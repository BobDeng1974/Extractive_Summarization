almost 13,000 patients die needlessly from severe infections every year , experts warned yesterday			1
a study found that opportunities to save lives lost to sepsis are missed because of delays in diagnosis and treatment			1
the care failures are not only lethal , they cost the @entity11 more through longer hospital stays , according to research by the @entity14			1
@entity15 , which is similar to septicaemia , happens when the immune system overreacts to an infection attacking organs such as the heart and liver			2
nearly 13,000 patients are dying needlessly from severe infections , say medical experts it causes fever , inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure			1
the ombudsman ’s report , published today for @entity32 , looked in detail at ten cases in which patients died through medical failures in the critical first few hours			1
problems included lack of early diagnosis , failure to recognise the severity of the illness , delays in treatment , and delay in control of infection			1
@entity48 , who was made health ombudsman in january 2012 , said : ‘ in the cases in our report , sadly , all patients died			1
in some of these cases , with better care and treatment , they may have survived			2
‘ it is time for the @entity11 to act to save lives by improving the care of patients with sepsis			1
’ grandmother @entity62 ( right ) lost her battle with sepsis on christmas day three years ago			2
she had been feeling poorly the week before , but was diagnosed with flu by her gp			2
on christmas eve mrs @entity62 , 64 , from @entity67 , @entity68 , became delirious and an ambulance was called			2
she was immediately diagnosed with sepsis by the medics			2
the inflammation caused the grandmother - of - eight to have a heart attack and she died on christmas morning , two days before her granddaughter @entity75 ’s first birthday			2
her daughter @entity79 said : ‘ all our lives changed that day			0
for me , i ’d lost my mum and my best friend , my husband had lost a surrogate mum			0
my children ’s loss was the most wonderful and devoted nanny			0
all in the space of six days			0
‘ i ’d never heard of sepsis before and i only wish i knew then what i know now			0
perhaps then my mum would still be here			0
’ mrs @entity79 said she believes more should be done to raise awareness among the public and the medical profession			0
she added : ‘ both the public and the medics need education and awareness of the condition			0
if i ’d have known what symptoms to look for the alarm bells would have rung and we could have sought help quicker			0
‘ all medics should receive training on entry at medical school			0
when an estimated 37,000 people a year are dying drastic action really is needed			1
’ @entity110 , of the @entity111 , said at least 12,500 lives could be saved a year if hospitals improved their procedures			1
‘ the best hospitals have achieved better outcomes from sepsis by adopting a simple set of life - saving measures , collectively known as the @entity15 , and ensuring that a culture of awareness around sepsis has been created , ’ he added			0
‘ we now need to spread this awareness to other health professionals and to the public			1
‘ the @entity127 @entity111 welcomes this excellent report from the ombudsman , which exposes common themes where care has failed			1
’ according to the @entity133 a doctor should not leave severe sepsis cases until antibiotics have been administered			0
intravenous antibiotics are the first line of treatment , along with oxygen , fluids and medication to increase blood pressure , but in many cases patients are not referred in time to critical care facilities			1
dialysis for kidney failure and breathing support for respiratory failure are necessary for the worst cases			0
@entity151 , of the @entity152 , said : ‘ this report shows the tragic consequences of sepsis and raises an important issue for everyone in health care			1
‘ it is vital that all staff are provided with training and support to enable them to recognise the signs and symptoms of sepsis , and crucially to know how to act quickly when sepsis is diagnosed			1
’ experts say sepsis is becoming more common , partly because of a rising number of elderly people with weakened immune systems or underlying diseases such as cancer			1
the illness accounts for 100,000 hospital admissions each year , with around 37,000 people dying			2
the most common causes are pneumonia , bowel perforation , urinary infection and severe skin infections			0
@entity183 , who is director of patient safety for @entity185 , said : ‘ we all need in every setting to understand the importance of identifying deterioration in both adults and children , in reducing the admission of full - term babies to neonatal care and identifying problems in vulnerable older people in the first 48 hours of acute illness			0
’ sepsis is different to septicaemia in that the infection is not limited to the blood and can be caused by a viral or fungal source as well as a bacterial one .			0

the delays are causing almost 13,000 deaths a year , say experts
they also cost the health service money through longer stays
health ombudsman said ' it is time for the @entity11 to act '
