@entity1 manager @entity0 is keen to avoid the kind of mistakes which have seen many top sides falter in the @entity5 this season as he eyes a place in the semi-finals			1
the @entity10 head into the weekend as favourites for the competition after fellow big guns @entity14 and @entity15 were drawn together in the last eight			1
@entity19 side @entity17 visit @entity20 on sunday and while rovers are 25 places below their hosts @entity0 insists they will be treated the same as @entity24 - second in the @entity25 - were last weekend			1
@entity0 says @entity1 will give @entity17 the respect they deserve in the @entity5 @entity27 managed to knock out the @entity25 's @entity28 in the last round @entity1 striker @entity30 ( right ) loses his marker to score a goal against @entity33 on march 4 winger @entity34 drills in a low cross against @entity33 players during @entity1 's 2 - 0 win at @entity20 ' they got their first league win away from home in four months in the week ( at @entity41 ) but we will give them the same respect we would give @entity24 or any other team , ' said the @entity1 boss			1
' it is a big game			2
we made it clear our intent in this competition was to get to the final and win it and to do that you have to beat different types of teams and @entity17 will come and look to make it difficult for us			1
' i think ( @entity17 manager ) @entity58 has done an outstanding job since he has gone in there			1
' he 's had a similar pathway to myself in terms of working in youth development so he understands football clubs from the top to the bottom			2
' he has gone in there in very difficult circumstances and stabilised the club and got everyone on the same path and has done an outstanding job			2
' while securing @entity74 football for next season remains the priority @entity0 would dearly love to win some silverware in his third year in charge			1
having reached the semi-finals of the @entity80 he hopes to go at least one better in this competition , although he admits he is only interested in a final at @entity83			2
' people say getting to @entity83 for the semi-final is a big thing but not really			0
winning and getting to the final is the big priority , ' he said			0
' in many ways i wish the semi-final was n't at @entity83 because i think it takes a little bit away from it			0
for me @entity83 should be the ultimate game			0
' but of course it is a great opportunity if we do go through to play a game at @entity83 , which we certainly would n't turn down			0
' in domestic cup competitions we were unfortunate not to make the final and in the @entity5 we are giving everything we can to win a trophy while trying to fight to get into the top four			1
' we want to get as high as we can - not just fourth - and win a trophy and if we can do that it will be a success			2
' @entity17 secured their first league away win in four months against @entity41 earlier this week @entity1 playmaker @entity107 ( right ) tussles with @entity33 striker @entity108 ( left ) at @entity20 @entity1 are the team of the moment with their @entity25 form second - to - none and , although their attacking style is again winning plaudits , what is probably more significant is their new - found defensive resilience			1
they have conceded just six goals in nine league matches since the turn of the year , during which time they are unbeaten			0
despite enforced changes to his backline everyone now appears to know what job they are supposed to be doing - unlike earlier in the campaign when no matter who he brought in there was always an air of vulnerability			2
' what is pleasing are the poor goals we have stopped conceding , ' he said			0
' our method of play is based on aggressive pressure and with that you limit teams to not many opportunities			0
' when that does n't function well you concede poor goals			0
that was the key , we made too many mistakes			0
' in the last three months there is a better balance to the team , players are comfortable and with and without the ball collectively we are much stronger			0
' @entity149 ( left ) and @entity150 ( right ) close down @entity33 's @entity151 ( centre ) on wednesday @entity1 are currently fifth in the @entity25 with 51 points , just two behind @entity14 in fourth			1

@entity0 is wary of the @entity19 side
