by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 18:30 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 14:12 est , 31 october 2012 children born to overweight mothers face a higher risk of being fat themselves – but breastfeeding can help offset the effect , a study has shown			2
being overweight and smoking during pregnancy both increase the chances of a child being obese , along with being heavy at birth and rapid weight gain as a baby			1
but breastfeeding and the late introduction of solid foods can reduce a baby ’s risk of becoming overweight by about 15 per cent , claim the researchers			1
big inheritance : children born to overweight mothers face a higher risk of being fat themselves , according to a study which could help parents make healthier choices for their babies they say it should help new mothers make healthier choices for their babies			0
@entity29 , who undertook the study , led by dr @entity31 , of @entity33 ’s @entity32 , said complex influences affected child development , ranging from genetics to parents ’ lifestyle			0
he added : ‘ we can speculate about how breastfeeding mitigates the risk of obesity in childhood – it could be mixed feeding , reduced calories from breastmilk , parental attitudes , or a combination of things			0
‘ the research shows that breastfeeding your baby compared with never breastfeeding does have a modest benefit			0
’ link : six out of seven studies looking at infant birth weight showed a correlation between babies who were heavy at birth and obesity in later childhood in the @entity66 a quarter of children aged four to five and a third of ten and 11 - year - olds are overweight			1
evidence suggests that children who are overweight by five are more likely to become obese – so overweight it threatens their health – in adulthood			1
the findings come from a systematic review and analysis of data from 30 previous studies involving 200,000 people			0
the studies investigated factors affecting babies during their first 12 months and their potential link with childhood obesity			0
the study , published in the journal @entity85 , discovered that children who were breastfed and introduced to solid food later had a slightly reduced chance of becoming overweight			0
children whose mothers were overweight before pregnancy were 1.37 times more likely to be overweight at the age of three ; 4.25 times more likely to be overweight at seven ; and 2.36 times more likely to be overweight between nine and 14 years			1
six out of seven studies looking at infant birth weight showed a significant link between babies who were heavy at birth and obesity in later childhood			1
similarly , rapid weight gain in a baby ’s first year often led to obesity , with one study showing those who gained the most weight were almost four times more likely to be overweight at four			1
children who were breastfed - however briefly - were 15 per cent less likely to become overweight			2
giving solid foods early may be linked to later obesity , with one study showing formula - fed babies given solids before four months were six times more likely to be overweight aged three than those getting them for the first time between four and five months			2
smoking during pregnancy alone increased the risk of children being overweight by 47.5 per cent			1
however , this may be because smoking is a good indicator of other social and lifestyle characteristics , said dr @entity29			0
he said the findings could be used to compile a ‘ checklist ’ for gps and health visitors to help them spot infants most at risk of becoming obese later in life			0
healthier ? breastfeeding and the late introduction of solid foods can reduce a baby 's risk of becoming overweight by about 15 per cent , researchers claim sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			2

smoking during pregnancy also increases chances of child being obese
being heavy at birth and rapid weight gain are factors , say researchers
a third of ten and 11 - year - olds in the @entity66 are overweight
