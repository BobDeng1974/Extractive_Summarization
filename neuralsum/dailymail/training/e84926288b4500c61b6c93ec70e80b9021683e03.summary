’ @entity2 , who was governor of @entity19 from 1990 to 1994 , told @entity20 that ‘ without question ’ @entity13 ’s remarks in @entity24 , @entity19 ‘ were appeals to race ’			1
he continued : ‘ the important thing i got out of this was @entity13 separated himself from what he accused the people of doing			1
as a matter of fact , what he said is they are going to do something to y’all , not to me			0
so he was still involved with that separate @entity3			0
“ as far as i am concerned , the president would not associate himself with those remarks			2
and i expect as the days go forward there will be more clarity associated with what the president feels about what @entity13 said			2

i think she ’ll be getting herself together for 2016			0

what the president need to do it disassociate himself from trying to show anybody that division is what this administration is about as some may have said , “ cool it , back up ”			2

’ awkward : @entity53 was visibly uncomfortable during interviews when he tried to explain away @entity13 's comments he told @entity107 : ‘ you know , the country ’s not as divided or obsessed with gaffes or some stray remark as @entity125 is			1
