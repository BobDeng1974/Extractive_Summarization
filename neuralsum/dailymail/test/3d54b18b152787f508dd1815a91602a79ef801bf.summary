@entity30 and @entity31 : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) are taking their masterclass of @entity24 : the @entity34 to ceos and executives across @entity5 breathe deep : they teach skills and strategies which can be implemented into people 's every day lives ' you can be groovier , you do n’t have to be in your hessian pants because it ’s got to be relevant for corporates , ' she added			1
the pair 's workshop , aptly named the @entity10 : the @entity34 , is a way for executives and their staff to learn a set of skills that will help them every day			1
create good habits that support you : make sure you always have a ' reward ' built in to the habit for example when you go for a run allow yourself to walk the final few blocks home , or grab a coffee			2
reset throughout the day : as a stress reset try and take three deep breaths feeling your belly move rather than your chest			2
do this as often as possible so you 're building on an accumulative practice			2
3.use your phone as a form of healthcare : have your key values programmed into your phone to pop up each morning and let these guide your decisions			0
set small sustainable habits : it 's the small things you do that have the biggest impact			0
look at something you already do and how can you make that into a habit			0
for example using your commuting time effectively by listening to an audiobook			0
set technology boundaries : switch off at least an hour before you go to bed at night , and do n't check work emails until you 're at your desk and able to deal with them			0
it takes attendees through a number of self - reflective activities , asking them to identify their key values and areas where they would like to improve			0
four mediation sessions are spread throughout the workshops , which are filled with facts such as 80 per cent of thoughts can be negative , and 98 per cent may be the same as the previous day			0
' one in six staff members now suffer from a form of mental illness , whether it be stress , anxiety , depression or suicide , ' @entity6 revealed			1
' people do n’t go and have a day off because they have the flu , they actually need a mental health day			0
' through their courses they work with executives and staff from organisations such as @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , kikki , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 to help individuals and business be the most effective they can be			1
asked whether there is any resistance to something that was once seen as ' hippie ' or ' new age ' , the women said they have not experienced any , but instead have been overwhelmed by the amount of people taking it on board			0
' i 've found in a lot of corporates that ’s shifting a little bit , because the consequence is too expensive for them ' @entity6 revealed			2
' when their staff blow up and their staff do get depressed and are away the cost of replacing them is too much , ' she added			0
through their courses the pair teach different strategies and activities that can be implemented into daily life which stop staff ' burning out '			1
decades of experience : @entity6 ( left ) has been a life coach for 15 years , while @entity7 ( right ) started her career in a wellness retreat crash and burn : @entity7 and @entity6 help ceos and executives avoid career burnouts and balance all elements of their lives ' there ’s all these different trains of thought in our mind , which train are you on ? ' @entity7 , who started working at a health retreat 22 years ago , said			1
' knowing that we have a choice because 80 percent of our thoughts can be negative , and 98 per cent can be the same as yesterday			0
' we have 60,000 - 80,000 thoughts a day so that ’s a lot of activity , so if you imagine you ’re standing at a train station , that ’s a lot of activity going on , ' she continued			0
practices such as meditation and even simple reminders of priorities are taught to help people stay on top of their game			2
@entity6 knows only too well the toll a demanding career can have on one 's health and wellbeing , and the implications of it crashing down around you			2
' i studied coaching after having chronic fatigue after a total burnout in the corporate world , ' she revealed			0
' ( @entity200 ) studied coaching , coached athletes into retirement and then turned corporate , so i now coach ceos , state managers , business owners and have done so for a long time , @entity6 added			1
creating good habits : the pair share a number of key tips which help staff take control of their lives and be the best version of themselves @entity215 : @entity6 and @entity7 liken themselves to the duo from the 1991 film whereas @entity7 's background is ' looking after type a achievers like @entity6 '			1
' i grew up in a remote part of @entity223 and ended up working at @entity225 health retreat , which was two doors away from my family home			0
' that cemented my passion for wellness so helping people overcome self - destructive behaviours , so alcohol addiction , drug addiction			0
' but then i decided retreat experiences are fantastic but how do you integrate this back into the real world ? , ' @entity7 said			2
it was around this time that the women met in a park while out with their kids , and decided to combine their knowledge to make it accessible for a wider audience			0
