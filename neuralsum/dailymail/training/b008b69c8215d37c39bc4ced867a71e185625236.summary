by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 4 june 2013 police should help identify high - profile suspects to end inaccurate speculation on the internet , the government 's top lawmaker said last night			2
it would be ' very sensible ' in some cases for forces to confirm to the @entity10 who they have arrested , said attorney general @entity12			1
he added that police have the ' discretion ' to reveal the identity of suspects , but warned journalists not to launch ' fishing expeditions '			1
attorney general @entity12 has said it would be ' very sensible ' in some cases for forces to confirm to the @entity10 who they have arrested his comments come after @entity24 made yet another arrest as part of @entity27 , which was launched following the @entity29 sex abuse scandal			1
dozens of @entity32 users inaccurately named the 72 - year - old suspect as various celebrities , including a veteran pop star and a businessman			0
however , sources said the latest arrest – the 13th since the inquiry began – was not a well - known figure			0
mr @entity12 said : ' clearly , if the @entity10 have got to know who somebody is who 's been arrested and are publicising that , then clearly it might be very sensible for the police to confirm that fact			1
' but equally , i do n't think we should end up with a process in which the police are being subjected to fishing expeditions with dozens of names being reeled out to them and an obligation to pick one of them			1
that seems to me to be a matter which must be within the discretion of the police			2
' asked if he was concerned that well - known figures could be inaccurately named on social media , mr @entity12 said ' public interest ' could free the police to say the wrong person is in the spotlight			1
' under certain circumstances that might be a good reason why the person under arrest should have their name publicised , ' he added			0
the comments come after @entity24 made yet another arrest as part of @entity27 , which was launched following the @entity29 sex abuse scandal he also highlighted the ' odd ' situation in which the names of suspects are widely known to the public , but only confirmed by police days later			2
for instance , the identities of the two suspects in the killing of drummer @entity84 were reported worldwide – but it was up to ten days before @entity87 and @entity88 were named by the @entity89			0
the attorney general is the latest senior government figure to step into the row over new police guidelines that promote a policy of ' secret arrests '			0
following the @entity98 report , forces have been told to identify suspects only when it is in the ' public interest ' or when it could help prevent or detect crime			0
@entity102 of the @entity103 said the guidance aims to ' strike the correct balance ' between privacy and ' open and honest ' relations with the media .			0

@entity12 said police have ' discretion ' to reveal identities
but he warned journalists not to launch ' fishing expeditions '
