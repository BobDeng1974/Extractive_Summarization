from @entity2 oligarchs to @entity4 royalty to @entity6 producers , it takes a certain type of person to own a superyacht - crucially , they must be super rich			0
the official term for this fortunate minority is a @entity11 , someone with more than us $ 30million ( £ 20m ) in net assets , and there are just 200,000 of them in the world			0
but even for the likes of @entity25 and @entity27 president @entity26 , owners of two of the costliest private vessels in the world , the costs associated with keeping such a big boat on the water would have them double - checking their direct debits			0
insurance company @entity29 has compiled a study to find out the real cost of owning a superyacht and the figures are , for us mere mortals , almost inconceivable			1
for @entity40 owner @entity37 , a 162.5m vessel with a missile defence system that cost the billionaire an astronomical $ 500milion ( £ 332 ) , that means $ 50m ( £ 33m ) a year			0
the standard fuel usage for a 71m yacht is 500 litres an hour , meaning an average of $ 400,000 ( £ 265m ) is spent on petrol every year per vessel			1
@entity63 businessman @entity62 's 138.4m @entity61 has a relatively small crew of 45 @entity65 , the super efficient 110m behemoth owned by @entity2 businessman @entity67 the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) works out at 15 - 25 per cent of the vessel 's value while docking costs are an average $ 350,000 ( £ 232,000 ) and $ 240,000 ( £ 159,000 ) the standard for insurance sees the costs soar			1
add to that the expected $ 1million ( £ 664,000 ) per year for maintenance and repairs and the wages for an average $ 1.4m ( £ 930,000 ) for an on - board crew - which can range from less than 20 to 154 staff on the sultan of @entity83 's mysterious @entity82 - and it 's a significant outlay			2

superyachts are *generally* owned by @entity89
insurance company @entity29 calculates what they really pay
on average , owners pay 10 per cent of yacht 's value in costs per year
