when it comes to finding the right bra , even the most proficient shoppers often despair			2
and , according to a survey , it ’s hardly surprising – because there are seven different ways in which they can go wrong			0
four in five women admitted to suffering from one of the problems , nicknamed ‘ booby traps ’ , every day			2
and more than a third admitted to experiencing the ‘ quadraboob ’ , in which breasts spill over the top of a too - small cup , creating the impression of four breasts			0
what a boob ! @entity27 often suffers the dreaded @entity28 the survey , carried out by lingerie firm @entity30 to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the bra , found many women had n’t had a proper fitting in two years			1
many wear bras that are too small because they can not find attractive ones in larger sizes , or are unwilling to admit that their breasts are larger than @entity42 – the biggest size in many ranges			0
@entity30 is now launching an online ‘ boob school ’ to teach women how to choose a well - fitting bra			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we ’d noticed that there were a number of booby traps women were falling into , normally because they ’ve never experienced a proper fitting and they simply do n’t know how to spot the signs that their bra is no longer giving them the support they need			1
‘ by identifying the seven classic bra faux pas and launching @entity59 , we ’re hoping that women everywhere can become more knowledgeable about what makes a really good fitting bra			1
’ ladies with larger assets experiencing more problems finding a properly fitted bra and dealing with the challenges of having more to handle in the first place			2
the @entity28 was the biggest pitfall for ladies with a larger bust , with 53 per cent of women who were above a @entity74 cup size falling prey			1
falling into that old booby trap : @entity77 suffers a multitude of sins like the @entity80 and @entity81 the survey found 41 per cent of us suffer from the @entity81 , where wires in the cup sitting on your boob rather than your ribcage			2
the @entity89 , where the back of the bra rides up , affects 39 per cent , while a third ( 36 per cent ) get the dreaded @entity92 , where the bust spills over the top of the cup , giving the impression of four boobs			0
the @entity98 , where the front of the bra does n't sit flat on the sternum between the boobs affects almost a third ( 28 per cent ) while the @entity103 affects a quarter ( 26 per cent ) who are n't getting enough support , creating the illusion of saggy boobs			1
another quarter who buy bras that are too big , 24 pr cent , suffer from the appearance of @entity113 where there 's too much fabric			0
not their breast effort : @entity119 's cups are a tad small as she 's getting some @entity81 , and @entity103 @entity120 is n't supported the @entity80 is created with over uplift , transforming your boobs into something that resembles a ledge , and it affects 12 per cent ( including voluptuous @entity77 )			1
although all the faux pas identified could be avoided by wearing a good fitting bra , only one in five women said that they were extremely confident that they were wearing the correct bra size			1
this is unsurprising , as the study also identified several reasons why women continually experience such uncertainty about their bra size			2
over a two year period , three quarters ( 77 per cent ) have lost or gained weight , 62 per cent have changed their clothes size , 17 per cent have gone through the menopause and 10 per cent have had a baby , all potentially impacting upon their bra size			0
the strap around your body should be firm but comfortable			0
when you stand side - on at a mirror , the strap that runs around your body should be horizontal and should not ride up at the back at all			0
the wires at the front should lie flat against your rib cage and should not dig in , rub or poke out at the front			0
your breasts should be enclosed in the cups and you should have a smooth line where the fabric at the top of the cup ends and meets your bust			0
you should n't have any ridge or bulging over the top or sides of the cups , even if you are wearing a balconette style or lower cut shape			0
perfect fit ? you should have a smooth line where the fabric at the top of the cup ends and meets your bust however , despite the shifts in boob size that women are experiencing , 24 per cent of @entity172 women admitted to having never had a bra fitting and 21 per cent have n't been for a fitting for at least four years			1
the @entity30 research was conducted by @entity179 and 1,155 women of all ages from across the @entity172 completed the survey			0
they found that around two fifths of women feel comfortable telling a friend that they 've made a bra faux pas - with a woman from the @entity190 most likely to be up front ( 50 per cent saying they 'd tell a friend )			1
women from the @entity194 and those aged 51 and over are the least likely to make a bra faux pas			1
a third of women have had a fitting in the last year			2
half of those who are @entity202 size have had a fitting in the last year , the same applies to those aged 30 or under , but a quarter of women who had n't had a fitting in more than two years feel they simply do n't need a fitting , whilst a fifth are too embarrassed			1
after this lady got fitted by a professional she discovered her true , completely different , correctly fitting size four fifths own more than five bras , but less than half wear more than five bras regularly			0
@entity216 , buying and marketing director at @entity30 , comments : ' we 'd noticed for some time that there were a number of booby traps women were falling into , normally because they 've never experienced a proper fitting and they simply do n't know how to spot the signs that their bra is no longer giving them the support they need			2

' in response to the findings , @entity30 is now launching the world 's first @entity59 to help other women avoid falling into these booby traps , in a bid to help women feel brilliant about their boobs			1
