protection : agents protecting @entity2 would have been brandishing pretend weapons elite secret agents sent to protect @entity7 ’s new president @entity2 at a major overseas meeting forgot to pack their guns , it has emerged			1
in scenes straight out of an @entity16 film , highly - trained members of the @entity11 ( @entity12 of the @entity13 ) thought they had placed their weapons in secure suitcases when they travelled to @entity19 last week			1
in fact there had been an oversight , and when the unit ’s luggage was inspected in @entity25 in accordance with diplomatic protocol the guns were not there			1
this meant that the agents wearing sunglasses and earpieces around mr @entity2 would have been brandishing ‘ pretend ’ guns in their shoulder holsters			1
@entity25 has some of the worst gun crime figures in the world , meaning the @entity7 service personnel would have felt particularly vulnerable			1
‘ as far as anyone can remember , this was the first time this has happened , ’ one officer insisted to the @entity7 investigative weekly @entity39 , which in turn suggested that the agents were ‘ ready to fight with their bare hands			1
’ there were few jokes back at the @entity49 in @entity50 , however			2
when the diplomatic party including mr @entity2 were safely back in @entity7 , the agent responsible for the fiasco was duly sacked			0
faux pas : the agents ' blunder has been compared with @entity59 ' bungling @entity16 character the president of @entity7 is widely considered to be the second most powerful executive position in the world after the @entity64 president			2
there have been numerous attempts to assassinate the holder of the job in recent years , with the @entity11 set up in 1983 to give him maximum protection			0
following an attempted bomb attack on @entity75 in 2002 the number of officers in the unit was increased to 60 , and all are firearms specialists			0
one of mr @entity2 ’s first acts on taking office in may was to increase the number of women in the @entity11 , including appointing a female head – the first in its history			0
hapless : highly - trained members of the @entity11 thought they had placed their weapons in secure suitcases when they travelled to @entity19 ( pictured ) @entity16 was the hapless fictional @entity7 detective in the @entity89 film comedies			2
made famous by the @entity91 actor @entity59 , he famously employed a martial arts expert called @entity89 to periodically ‘ attack ’ him in his @entity50 flat so as to sharpen his bare - handed fighting skills			0
@entity89 would frequently appear at the wrong moments , however , leading @entity16 to shout : ‘ not now , @entity89 ! ’			0
the @entity49 would not comment on the latest real - life security scandal ‘ for security reasons			0

elite agents discovered their weapons were *missing* when they arrived in @entity25 for the @entity102 *summit*
