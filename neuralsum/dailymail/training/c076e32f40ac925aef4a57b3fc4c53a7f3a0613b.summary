by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 15:52 est , 25 october 2013 @entity4 's parents were indicted with child abuse charges resulting in her death - but the district attorney refused to prosecute them , newly - unsealed grand jury documents revealed today			1
in the 1999 indictment , @entity8 and @entity9 were not directly accused of murdering their six - year - old daughter , who was found strangled and beaten in 1996 , but were accused of putting her in a situation that ultimately led her to her death			1
the couple were never charged because former district attorney @entity15 refused to sign the document and prosecute them , saying there was insufficient evidence			0
the grand jury documents released in @entity21 , @entity22 on friday were compiled long before dna evidence led the da to publicly exonerate the @entity25 in 2008			1
but despite their indictment , her parents were not prosecuted over her death ' the dna was not available to the grand jury in 1999 , ' @entity31 , the @entity25 ' attorney , told the @entity34 on friday			1
' what we have here is a release of a sliver of the evidence that the grand jury looked at and reviewed			2
it 's just based on incomplete evidence			0
' a reporter for @entity45 and the @entity46 had filed a lawsuit to seek the records and the documents were released on friday after a ruling by a @entity22 judge			1
in the four - page document , one of the counts read that they ' did unlawfully , knowingly , recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child 's life or health , which resulted in the death of @entity4			2
' even though the grand jury voted to go ahead with the charges in 1999 , the @entity24 had declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilt without a reasonable doubt , the @entity64 reported			2
the body of @entity4 , a child beauty queen , was found bludgeoned and strangled in her family 's home in @entity21 on december 26 , 1996 , hours after she was reported missing			1
indicted : @entity8 and @entity9 , who are pictured in 2004 , were accused of putting their daughter in a situation that ultimately led to her death			0
mrs @entity4 died from ovarian cancer in 2006 the parents of @entity4 were both indicted with child abuse resulting in death and acting as an accessory to a crime by the grand jury in 1999			1
on the child abuse charge , the grand jury wrote that @entity8 and @entity9 ' did unlawfully , knowingly , recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child 's life or health , which resulted in the death of @entity4			1
' on a second count of accessory to a crime , the grand jury wrote that each parent ' did render assistance to a person ' with the intent to prevent their arrest or prosecution ' knowing they had committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death ' her parents had called police to report her kidnapping and said they found a note demanding a ransom of $ 118,000 for her safe return			1
after her death , her parents were placed under an ' umbrella of suspicion ' , an investigator said , but in 2008 , the @entity24 said that evidence suggested the killer was a stranger , not a family member			2
two years earlier , mrs @entity4 had died after a long battle with ovarian cancer			0
the statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002			0
the case has never been solved			0
if @entity4 had not been killed , she would now be 23			0
the documents ' release comes just days after @entity4 's father said he did n't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter 's case released to the public			1
@entity142 's attorneys had sent a letter to the @entity145 district attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the parents			2
' public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame ( @entity142 ) and his late wife @entity153 , ' the letter said , according to the @entity64			0
help us find the killer : @entity142 looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife @entity157 touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of @entity4 ' mr. @entity4 will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law			2
' nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view			0
' but the judge ordered the current da to provide a reason why the documents should be kept secret			0
he provided them to a judge on tuesday to determine if they were suitable to be released			0
officials told mr @entity4 that they would only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired			0
the judge also said that the court would not be permitted to release all of the information in the case			0
' the court is sympathetic to the position of mr. @entity4 , ; judge @entity194 said on wednesday , but a release of the entire record " would set a precedent that would impede other @entity196 in performing their functions under statute and rule '			0
december 26 , 1996 : @entity4 , 6 , is found dead in the basement of the family 's @entity21 home , several hours after her mother called 911 to say the girl was missing and that she had found a ransom note			1
