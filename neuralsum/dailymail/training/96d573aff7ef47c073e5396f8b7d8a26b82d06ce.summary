@entity18 in @entity35 , @entity34 , which has attracted the ire of local planners after the owners used the wrong type of tiles on the roof when the couple replaced the roof 's traditional @entity28 slates with conservation slates , planning chiefs demanded the roof be restored with the @entity28 tiles - a job which would cost at least £ 100,000 desperate to rid themselves of this burden , the couple decided to sell up – but met opposition from mrs @entity16 ’s uncle , @entity31 , 69			1
his timber firm has operated on the site for 39 years and would have to move in the event of a sale			0
mr @entity31 , fiercely objected to being driven out of the converted barn where he lives because of the couple ’s ‘ irresponsible actions ’ , the court heard			1
at a hearing last week judge @entity59 ordered the sale of the entire estate after concluding family relations had broken down			0
the judge added : ‘ there is no real hope of the parties all living at the property together again			0
’ mr @entity31 told the court he could see no good reason why he should be forced to move and suggested dividing up the estate in order to let him remain at the home he shares with long - term partner @entity73 , 72			1
but the judge said partition of the estate – the farmhouse , two barns and other outbuildings – was banned by a restriction in the title deeds			1
