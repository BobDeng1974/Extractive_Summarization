veteran forager @entity2 , the only person in the country licensed to pick mushrooms commercially in the @entity20 , said conditions this year were ' phenomenal '			1
the 71 - year - old said above average temperatures were to thank for the abundance of the much sought - after fungi in forests and fields around @entity16			2
it is a stark contrast to last year when heavy rain and cold temperatures in autumn and winter all but wiped out the country ’s wild mushrooms			1
this year ’s mushroom haul has been so prevalent it has sparked a rise in the number of guerilla pickers pillaging certain rural areas			2
mrs @entity2 , who supplies wild mushrooms to @entity4 ’s top restaurants including @entity41 ’s @entity40 , said : ' it has been an absolutely bumper year for mushrooms and it ’s not over yet			1
' last year was the worst year for mushrooms in a long time			1
' some mushrooms grew but most were completely waterlogged , submerged in an inch and a half of rain water			2
thankfully it is all change this year			2
' the difference is that we have had a good , long summer and the soil is still warm			2
' phenomenal years like this one only come round once every eight years - that seems to be the growing cycle of mushrooms			2
' next year is likely to be just an average year so we are making the most of it now			0
' already there have been loads of beefsteak mushrooms and the ceps are so prevalent it is likely they will go on until december			0
' but this year will go down as the year of the hen of the wood , quite an unusual mushroom that you wo n’t find in supermarkets			1
' this year it has been plentiful			0
one special year like this one i picked 75 kilograms of mushrooms in three hours on @entity74			1

she also won a civil suit against the @entity89 and was granted a unique licence from the @entity91 and @entity92			0
mrs @entity2 is now the only person in the country who can legally pick more than the allotted 3lbs of mushrooms in the @entity20			1
she added : ' unlike some , i make sure the mushrooms do n’t die off by cutting their stalks instead of pulling their roots off			0
' by doing that you can return to a patch of mushrooms 10 days later and they will have grown back			0
' some people come and pick truckloads of mushrooms and then sell them on illegally while others leave their rubbish all over the forest			0
' i do n’t do that - i look after nature			0
foraging for mushrooms is a lovely way of life			0
i think of it as going out to look for old friends			0
' mushrooms were among the earliest forms of life on earth and i always say that when i die i will come back as a mushroom because i am indestructible			0
