@entity232 , a former senior anti-terrorism adviser to the @entity8 government , said evidence uncovered so far shows ' this is n't a case of an independent homegrown radicalised cell			2
' this is a local facilitator and two operatives coming from abroad on a mission with a connection to @entity1			2
' governments and experts in recent years have highlighted jihadists who radicalise on their own without direct connections to terror groups as a growing threat			0
but @entity232 said the @entity2 case underscores how organised cells with links to known groups are still dangerous			0
' the whole story is very serious , ' said @entity232 , now a terror expert with the @entity253 in @entity89			0
' it shows they were trying most likely to target something from the air			0
' @entity8 police have arrested dozens of @entity1 suspects since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks in the @entity189 , and more after the 2004 train bombings in @entity89			0
most @entity133 - based terror arrests in @entity2 over the last several years have been of lower - level players and people trying to recruit jihadists			0
but the detention of the @entity9 and the @entity11 was significant because of their apparent high level of training and capability , said @entity270 , a terror expert at the @entity271 .			1
