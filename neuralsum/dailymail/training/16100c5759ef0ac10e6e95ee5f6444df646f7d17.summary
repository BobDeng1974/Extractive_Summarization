by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 18:30 est , 15 january 2014 @entity2 has been named as the gout capital of @entity4 with one in 40 people suffering the condition which commonly causes swelling and pain to the big toe our love of alcohol and reliance on junk food has made @entity2 into the country worst affected by gout in @entity4 , researchers claim			1
a record one in 40 people in the @entity2 have been diagnosed with the painful arthritic disorder that famously afflicted @entity20 – bringing the total number of patients with the condition to around 1.5million			1
historically known as ‘ the disease of kings ’ , gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle			2
a new study , published in the @entity30 , suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in cases , with the @entity2 ahead of @entity34 and @entity35			1
however two - thirds of sufferers are still not being prescribed drugs for the condition – a statistic that has remained unchanged since the late 1990s , according to scientists			1
lead researcher dr @entity42 , from @entity43 , said ‘ we are eating too much junk food			2
' we are also drinking a lot of alcohol			2
all these things cause gout			2
‘ the prevalence of gout has risen in the past 16 years and is now the highest reported within @entity4			0
’ ‘ but it is curable , with the right drugs , and that is also something we are not doing very well at because gout is extremely painful if left untreated			1
gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis , with sudden onset of acute pain , redness and swelling in peripheral joints , most commonly the joint in the big toe			0
it is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals , which is related to high uric acid in the blood , and can be alleviated with urate - lowering treatment ( @entity70 )			0
the condition used to be rare among young people , but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people			1
' despite being the commonest inflammatory arthritis the management of gout continues unchanged with just a minority of patients receiving @entity70 and new patients not being treated in a timely fashion , ' dr @entity42 added			0
the study found wide variation in both the number of existing and new cases with the most occurring in @entity88 and the @entity89 of @entity90			0
analysis of primary care records from the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) between 1997 and 2012 found among more than 4.5 million eligible people almost 116,000 already had gout			1
eating junk food and drinking too much alcohol are known to encourage the condition commonly known as ' the disease of kings ' this is a prevalence of 2.5 per cent , almost twice as high as previous estimates and topping @entity34 ( 1.4 per cent ) and @entity35 ( around one per cent )			2
men were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed than women , mostly between the ages of 35 and 39 at a ratio of 11 to two			0
more than 7,000 new cases were identified giving an overall incidence of 2.26 per 1,000 person years , rising to 3.5 among men			0
they were highest for both sexes among those aged 80 to 84			0
during the study period the prevalence of gout rose by 64 per cent , increasing by around 4 per cent every year			0
rates were around four times higher in men			0
the number of new cases rose by 30 per cent during this time , increasing by around 1.5 per cent each year			0
new cases were highest in @entity88 and the @entity89 of @entity90 , and lowest in the @entity121 and @entity122			0
only a third of people with gout were getting urate - lowering drugs , a proportion that remained constant over 15 years , says a report online in @entity30 ( must credit )			1
in 2012 , fewer than one in five patients was prescribed drugs within six months of their diagnosis , and only around one in four was still on treatment a year later			1
this rate was virtually unchanged since 1997 , despite the publication of guidelines on optimal management of the condition			2
patients got better at taking their drugs , with around four out of 10 doing so in 2012 , compared with 28 per cent in 1997 , but these figures suggests more needs to be done , said dr @entity42			1
‘ it is apparent educational initiatives to improve practitioner knowledge , interest and standard of care of the only ‘ curable ’ form of inflammatory arthritis are urgently required ’ he added			0
@entity153 dr @entity152 , medical trustee of the @entity2 @entity154 said ‘ we welcome this new data which reaffirms gout as a significant health problem			1
‘ the increase in gout is a result of a combination of factors - primarily an ageing population and a growing obesity problem in the @entity2			1
’ researchers last month found gout may run in the family , partly because of genetics and also through sharing similar diets .			2

around 1.5million people in the @entity2 are affected by the condition
recent research suggests 21st century diets are fuelling a surge in sufferers
two thirds are still not being prescribed with drugs for the condition
