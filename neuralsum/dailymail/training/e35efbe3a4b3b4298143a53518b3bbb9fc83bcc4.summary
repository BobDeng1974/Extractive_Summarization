by @entity0 last updated at 1:40 am on 30th december 2011 at first glance , you ’d be forgiven for thinking these photos are of two different women			2
in fact , both are @entity7 – before and after she was hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted with a gastric band in a desperate bid to lose weight			1
the primary school teacher has now dropped nearly five dress sizes after losing eight stones in just 14 months			0
@entity14 , 31 , who existed ' liquid only ' diet in a bid to control her weight , was delighted as she tucked into her first @entity20 dinner in two years and she revealed yesterday how the achievement meant she could enjoy her first solid @entity20 dinner for two years on sunday			1
mrs @entity7 , who tipped the scales at 21 stones when she began the treatment , said : ‘ i think the results are incredible			1
‘ i ’ve still got a bit more weight to lose , but i just ca n’t get over it			2
it ’s given me the willpower , it ’s changed my life completely			0
’ the 31 - year - old said she had struggled with her weight since having an over-active thyroid gland removed as a teenager			1
she had to have a hysterectomy in 2006 and blames hormone replacement therapy for causing her weight to creep up as she began comfort eating , snacking on crisps and chocolate			2
at her heaviest , she wore size 24 clothes			0
but when her husband , @entity44 , 46 , told her about a colleague ’s amazing weight loss due to gastric band hypnotism , she was intrigued			1
so she paid £ 275 for ten sessions with hypnotist @entity49 in october last year			2
transformation : @entity7 on holiday in @entity52 last year ( left ) and today after shedding more than 7 stones ( right ) last year @entity7 resorted to pureeing her entire @entity20 lunch so she could join her family at the dinner table he managed to convince her that she had had surgery to have a gastric band fitted			1
he put her on an eating plan similar to that of real patients , forcing her to begin with pureed food before building up to solids			0
to her amazement , within days she started shedding the pounds			0
‘ basically you feel like your stomach is the size of your fist , ’ said mrs @entity7 of @entity66 , @entity67			1
‘ at the start you only have liquids , yoghurts for breakfast and soup for lunch and dinner – and i was full up			2
‘ if i had too much i would feel sick and that ’s how you ’re meant to feel if you actually had it done			0
’ it meant she was forced to eat a pureed @entity20 dinner last year			1
that 's better : @entity7 enjoyed preparing a proper @entity20 dinner this year after finally losing the weight ‘ when my mum put the pureed dinner in front of me , i felt sick just looking at it			1
but she ’d gone to all that effort so i had to try it , ’ added mrs @entity7 , who now wears size 14 - 16 clothes			1
‘ had i been able to afford a real band i may have thought about it , but i really did n’t want more surgery so this was another option			0
i was willing to try anything			0
‘ i ’ve still got a bit more to lose , i ’d like to be a comfortable size 14			0
but so far i ’m delighted with the results			0
’ mr @entity49 said the treatment created the ‘ same feelings experienced with surgery , but without the discomfort , inconvenience and cost ’ .			0
