@entity0 was lazing around at his home on @entity2 when his phone bleeped			1
it was a simple text message from his best mate @entity5			0
‘ @entity6 wants a word ’ it read			0
‘ @entity6 who ? ’ replied @entity0			1
‘ @entity10 you * * * * ! ! ! ’			1
the night before , @entity0 had made a memorable debut in the television studio at @entity14 alongside a grinning @entity5			1
he did n't hold back			0
‘ injuries have n’t helped him , but he does n’t look any better now than when he was 17			2
’ @entity0 has continued to tell it how it is since that evening , which is part of the attraction to his new employer @entity18 after a playing career spent largely away from the media glare			1
as we chat about his new career as a tv analyst , he peppers the conversation with gems such as : ‘ i wish i could have played for @entity38			1
’ nothing is off limits			0
he is passionate about the national team but scathing of @entity43 ’s claim that @entity44 play just like @entity45			1
more on all that in a moment			0
back to @entity6 and that night at @entity14			1
‘ i would never have answered the phone if i knew he was going to talk about it to everyone , ’ admitted @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t think he should have told anyone about our phone call , but it ’s up to him			0
i had hoped it was private			0
’ @entity0 sees something special in @entity59			1
the former @entity61 midfielder first came across him in 2010 , when @entity10 was on loan at @entity63			1
back in the day : @entity0 first came across @entity59 when he was on loan at @entity63 @entity0 hit out at @entity10 after @entity22 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity66 in march the midfielder said he was hurt by the @entity70 @entity61 man 's comments ‘ i was n’t having a pop , ’ he explained			1
‘ i was disappointed he was n't being helped by his club , by his manager or his assistant manager			2
‘ as an @entity77 midfield player i just want him to do better			2
i know he has had a nightmare with those ankles , but i played against him when he was 17 and i just thought “ @entity80 ”			1
’ @entity0 , like everyone else , saw the pictures of @entity10 partying away in @entity83 with @entity84 and @entity85 in the days after @entity44 ’s shameful @entity87 exit			1
he is a man who likes a pint down the local with his pals and believes players are entitled to a few drinks if it helps them relax at the end of a tough season			1
‘ what @entity6 gets up to in the summer is up to him , ’ he added			0
‘ he had a smoke , but it ’s not the end of the world			1
‘ at @entity61 the laundry room used to be full of smoke in the mornings because @entity103 and @entity104 would n't start training until they had a cigarette			1
‘ i 've known foreign players have a glass of wine or a beer the night before a game			0
‘ i have never smoked , but when there was a chance to go out with my wife or my friends then i would take it			0
i was brought up going to the pub on saturday and sunday afternoon with my mum and dad			0
‘ when i became a first - team player i realised when i was 19 or 20 that i would have to be more professional			2
’ caught : @entity10 was photographed with a cigarette in his mouth in @entity83 this summer time out : @entity0 claims @entity104 ( left ) and @entity103 both enjoyed a cigarette before training @entity0 was a dedicated player who won 11 @entity128 titles and two champions @entity129 during his phenomenal career			1
he says he never considered leaving @entity61 — ‘ imagine me as a @entity135 ? you must be joking ’ — and he was genuinely surprised to learn of @entity133 ’s admiration for his ability			2
‘ it is embarrassing for someone of his ilk to talk about me like that , ’ he admits			2
‘ what a player he has been for @entity144 and @entity145			2
i only wish we could have played together			2
’ ‘ no one ever came in for me , ’ he claims , although he goes on to admit he would have taken the chance to play for @entity150 ’s controversial manager			2
‘ @entity38 is the man i would have wanted to play for			2
the way he comes across , he is a confident man and someone to look up to			0
he ’s probably a little bit funny to listen to for the players			0
‘ he is a great manager and has managed some great clubs			0
’ @entity0 played in some magnificent @entity61 teams , a powerful force at home and abroad as they chased so many honours			1
@entity0 talks as though he is still one of the boys in the dressing room , going on to say that he would love to see ‘ @entity162 or @entity163 , or both , in a red shirt ’			1
main man : @entity0 admits he would loved to have played under current @entity150 boss @entity38 @entity168 giants : @entity169 would like to see @entity162 ( left ) or @entity163 play for @entity61 he is a straight talker , something bookmaker @entity171 capitalised on when the former @entity61 midfielder wrote a column criticising @entity175 before the @entity87			1
@entity175 retaliated — ‘ i do n’t have his phone number and he does n't have mine ’ — but @entity0 maintains that the new @entity61 captain is one of the best players in the @entity128			1
‘ where the friction came from i ’m not too sure because i like the lad , ’ he added			0
‘ from my point of view there is no friction and i loved playing with him			0
he is an unbelievable footballer			1
he has been captaincy material for quite a while because he is vocal when he needs to be			2
‘ he demands the best from his team - mates and he is n't a shy lad			0
’ @entity175 is five short of 100 caps for his country but @entity0 is not taken with the pomp and ceremony that comes with those glass - cabinet presentations			1
@entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 have all been presented with golden caps on the pitch at @entity204			0
happy times : @entity0 and @entity175 during their time together at @entity61 captain fantastic ? @entity175 scored for @entity61 against @entity66 on saturday but saw his slide slip to defeat @entity210 not world class - @entity212 @entity0 , who won 66 caps before retiring from international duty in 2004 , said : ‘ what does 100 caps mean ? it means you 've played 100 games for your country			1
it ’s not achieving what you want to achieve			0
did you win something ? no. ’ @entity0 is passionate about the national team and admits he was surprised to hear @entity43 claim @entity44 were close to @entity45 ’s level despite exiting the @entity87 with a single point			1
‘ @entity44 would like to do what @entity45 are doing but are we close ? i honestly ca n’t see it			1
‘ we went out of the @entity87 after two games , but @entity43 obviously thinks we are on the right track			0
‘ @entity45 took young players to a @entity87 four years ago and were beating everyone			2
we did the same and went out			0
if i ’m honest , i ’m not really sure what it is that we do			0
’ game over : @entity44 were knocked out of the @entity87 after the group stage in @entity237 this summer despite @entity0 ’ undoubted ability on the pitch , along with his strident opinions off it , he has been lost to the national set - up			1
‘ what would i do ? ’ he wonders aloud			0
surely there has to be a role for him			0
instead he is working for @entity18 as he adjusts to life without @entity61			2
‘ i was n't looking to do it , but i ca n’t just sit at home			0
there has to be something to get out bed for			0
’ @entity0 is a pundit for @entity18			2
this season @entity18 will show 38 @entity128 matches exclusively live , plus top games from the @entity254 , @entity255 and live action from six @entity258 leagues including the @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and the @entity262			0
team work : @entity169 with the rest of the @entity18 pundits and presenters at the start of the new season			0

@entity0 was disappointed that @entity10 made their chat public
believes the @entity22 player has not improved since he was 17
@entity0 admits @entity277 smoking is not the end of the world
the @entity70 @entity61 star would love to have played for @entity38
would also like to see @entity162 or @entity163 at @entity14
@entity0 : @entity175 is an unbelievable footballer and captain material
