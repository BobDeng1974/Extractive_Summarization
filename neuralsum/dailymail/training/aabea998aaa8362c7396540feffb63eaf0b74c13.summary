by @entity0 the elixir of dermatological youth has now arrived on earth - in @entity5 's @entity4 , to be more precise - and its makers claim it can banish wrinkles in just 12 minutes			1
what 's more , after around ten sessions , the effects will last for years			0
that 's according to @entity12 , which is now offering a new radio frequency treatment called @entity14 , made by skincare specialists @entity16			1
on the face , the treatment can be used to repair deep lines and wrinkles , reduce double chins or attack lines and puffiness round the eyes			1
@entity14 in action : the cutting - edge treatment uses a single electrode it can also reduce fat , cellulite and fluid retention and increase smoothing and tightening on the body			1
the cutting - edge non-invasive equipment incorporates three technologies in one treatment			2
digital monopolar radio - frequency creates heat which stimulates the production of connective tissue in the dermis ( the thick layer of living tissue below the top thin layer of skin ) ; vacuum push - pull technology creates lymphatic drainage and digital transdermal introduction targets specific layers of the skin			1
unlike most radio frequency treatments , which use bi-polar or tri-polar technology , the @entity14 machine uses digital mono - polar technology , which means there 's only one electrode			1
what 's the advantage ? ' there is no unnecessary flow of current through the body , ' explains @entity62 at @entity63			0
' @entity14 creates retraction of collagen fibres , which produces a flash smoothing effect on the skin ’s surface giving instant results			2
' before : visible lines appear on the forehead after : 12 minutes later the head is smoother ' it also provides activation of the heat shock proteins restoring the balance of the dermis , stimulating the production of new supporting connective tissue and reorganising the dermal structure , making it thicker and reducing wrinkles , ' she says			2
' the treatment increases the production of elastin , hyaluronic acid and collagen too , which strengthen the dermis			0
' by producing greater blood flow , @entity14 nourishes and oxygenates the dermis , while increasing liquid and toxin drainage , ' she adds			2
the drainage specifically helps with the treatment of double chins and puffiness in the eye contour			1
the new treatment combines three technologies in one for the body , the machine works by fluidifying fat			2
' the fatty tissue presents great resistance to the flow of current , increasing lipolysis [ fat breakdown ] , ' @entity62 explains			0
they claim results are seen from the very first session - in as little as 12 minutes			0
to create a long - lasting effect , approximately five to 15 sessions are recommended for the face and between 10 and 20 for the body , depending on the condition treated			0
@entity118 dr @entity117 explains , ' radio frequency is great for people who do n't want needles and do n't want downtime , but it 's not a panacea for everyone			0
' if there 's already sun damage or loss of elasticity it 's unlikely to be as effective			0
it 's usually used more as a prevention that a correction			0
commenting on the 12 - minute claim @entity134 says , ' all radio frequency treatment tends to give people that healthy glow straight away , but the real measure of how effective it is is how they look a month down the line			1
' @entity140 , treatment manager at @entity12 says , ‘ despite working deep into the skin , the treatment is not painful so patients can still feel relaxed			1
' following an in - depth consultation the therapist uses a programme tailored to suit individual needs .			0
