the scurvy killed many of the early colonisers , researchers claim , causing the ultimate demise of the @entity122 settlement within just four years of it being founded			2
this is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at @entity5 ' settlement in what is now the @entity130			0

@entity122 , the first permanent @entity138 town in the @entity139 , was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation			0
bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village 's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s			1
@entity122 was established in what is now the @entity150 , @entity130			0

‘ they were still encased in earth when we started the study			0
we had to clean the bones to proceed , ’ study author @entity180 told @entity181			0
historians have blamed smallpox , influenza , and malaria for the town 's failure , but the latest study by @entity195 's @entity194 argues scurvy was the main cause			2
at least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs — ridges carved in the outer lining of bones — of what the study describes as ' severe scurvy			0
' @entity206 , caused by one to three months of vitamin c deficiency , plagued seafarers until the 18th century			0
symptoms included lethargy , anaemia , and , the re-opening of old wounds			0
researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they 'd sailed directly from @entity59 to @entity122 - a journey of two months or less			2
when @entity5 and his companions reached the @entity220 , they landed at a @entity222 outpost first			0
‘ it was especially long , this trip - three months			0
