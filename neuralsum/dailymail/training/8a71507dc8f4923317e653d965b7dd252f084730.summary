is there anything more important to a bride and groom at their reception than getting that all important first wedding dance just right ? perhaps ensuring that there is at least one super-cute kid making everyone smile by busting a few serious dance moves			1
this little boy was captured on film expressing himself through dance in the way only young children can , and @entity18 regular @entity17 posted it on his page with the title ' the best dancer i 've ever seen ' - for obvious reasons			1
one direction eat your heart out : the boy is clearly enjoying himself as he spins around and points his toes the dance floor is mainly filled with children but one little boy stands out a mile with his unforgettable dance moves			2
the phrase ' dance like nobody is watching ' might have been invented for this little boy as he spins around , jumps and leaps in the air and generally looks like he 's having the time of his life			1
oblivious to his surroundings - and to the fact that he 's being filmed by one of the wedding guests - he gives one direction a run for their money with his highly original dance moves			1
get your groove on : the boy is certainly light on his feet - perhaps helped by the fact that he 's kicked his shoes off and is able to slide around on the dancefloor			2
the arm movements are pretty cool too the man filming the footage is clearly impressed by the display , commenting : ' look at this kid go			0
yes , he is fabulous			0
' as the boy approaches a young girl his age , the man filming says : ' leave her alone it 's all you bro you got this			2
' laughing at the energetic display , he adds : ' he is talented			0
' he 's been inspired by modern singers and dance groups or perhaps seen some old films with @entity70 and @entity71 is n't clear , but this boy has certainly got some style			0
at one point he spins around and nearly loses his balance but manages to recover himself and carry on dancing totally unconcerned about who is watching .			0
