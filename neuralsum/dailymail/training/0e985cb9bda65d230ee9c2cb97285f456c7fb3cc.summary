by @entity0 published : 09:19 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 09:19 est , 20 august 2013 from wonderfully detailed portraits to striking @entity5 style designs , artist @entity2 's work might look like the result of careful work with a paintbrush but in this instance , appearances are deceptive			1
instead , @entity12 's intricate creations are made using a technique called ' quilling ' , which involves using strips of paper that have been rolled and then twisted into shape			1
' it takes a couple of days to make the simple designs and a few weeks for more elaborate and complicated pieces such as the portraits , ' reveals the @entity23 artist			1
colourful : this cheerful image , featuring a stag , the sea and a forest , is reminiscent of @entity30 prints incredible : @entity2 's wonderful work looks like was created with oil paint rather than strips of paper with a background in origami and a degree in graphic communication , quilling was n't in @entity2 's early plans but she says that when she finally discovered it , it was love at first try			1
' i started to use it about five years ago , ' she explains			0
' i was planning to create a small brochure with my hand - drawn illustrations to be sent out to potential clients and i was looking for an eye - catching image with my name ( @entity2 ) for the cover			0
' i created a number of hand - drawn variants , but i did nâ€™t like any of them and then i remembered an image from some school book showing a paper strips standing on edge and tried to make the letters using this technique			1
' the attempt was successful and over the next couple months i switched to quilling completely			2
' @entity65 itself dates back to the @entity67 when it was used by monks and nuns in @entity71 and @entity72 to decorate book covers			1
intricate : a close - up of @entity75 ( bottom ) shows off the amazing detail artists working with quilling can achieve striking : tiny details such as the man leading the horse and cart are picked out clearly in this creation delicate : this lovely image offers a bouquet of blooms reinterpreted through @entity2 's quilling technique later , it became popular as a hobby during the 18th century , when it was considered an appropriate pastime for gentlewomen			2
after years in decline , the art form resurfaced in the 1980s when quilling became hugely popular with enthusiastic children in search of a hobby			2
' my mum got interested in quilling after seeing my work so now she practices it as a hobby and makes presents for friends , ' adds @entity2			0
while few laymen will manage to hit the heights achieved by @entity2 , she does have some tips for those who would like to take up the craft			0
' there are lots of lessons on @entity113 and you can buy ready to go quilling kits and tools , ' she suggests			0
' the main thing is to have lot 's of patience since it is a quite slow and time - consuming craft but i believe the result is worth it			0
' see more of @entity2 's work on her blog at @entity124 impressive : @entity75 ( left ) and this quilled handbag explosion ( right ) are exquisitely detailed poignant : @entity126 is a sympathetic portrait of an elderly woman clutching a guitar			0

@entity131 creates spectacular images using strips of rolled paper
the artist discovered quilling by *chance* and has never looked back
@entity65 was first used by monks during the @entity67
