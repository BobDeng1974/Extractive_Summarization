' at least we 're not @entity1 '			0
that mantra is just about all @entity3 have had to cling on to of late with crises on and off the field suffocating the club			1
but @entity7 taking the managerial job on offer from the club is confirmation that things , even given saturday 's 8 - 0 mauling by @entity14 , could indeed be worse			1
as @entity15 revealed in september , @entity7 turned down an unofficial approach from @entity1 to replace @entity17 as their manager			1
@entity7 ( left ) is the new @entity3 manager , replacing @entity20 @entity7 , having sought assurances over @entity3 's finances before taking the job on monday , must therefore see some light at the end of the @entity27 's tunnel in spite of the current malaise at the club			1
that being said , emotional attachment is sure to have played a part in @entity7 's decision			1
he spent two years at @entity3 as a player from 1998 to 2000			1
but even if the club do not find much - needed financial investment soon , it 's hard to think of a more suitable appointment at this time by @entity3 than @entity7			1
the task at hand for him is not an easy one by an stretch			0
the scoreline tells the tale after @entity3 's 8 - 0 thrashing by @entity14 at @entity27 's on saturday @entity48 ( left ) and @entity49 look dejected as another @entity14 goal goes in anyone who thought sacking @entity20 would immediately see an up - turn in form suffered a rude awakening on saturday as a team picked and prepared by caretaker @entity55 were annihilated in front of their own fans			1
@entity59 and @entity60 have revived the fortunes of @entity62 and @entity63 respectively in recent weeks , but the players were always there at those clubs			0
the squad assembled by @entity20 , on the other hand , is on paper frankly not good enough to stay in the championship			2
@entity3 , along with @entity1 , stand out as lacking the pedigree of player to compete with the best in the second tier			2
a talented crop of youngsters are complemented by a smattering of players signed by @entity20 from the lower leagues who , to a man , have not delivered			2
@entity7 challenges @entity83 's @entity82 in a @entity84 ( now @entity70 ) play - off semi-final in 2000 if @entity3 are to stand any chance of staying up @entity7 must use the loan market wisely and get some of @entity20 's signings performing			1
even assuming that @entity1 go down , @entity3 must leapfrog two more sides to stay up , and it is hard to see how they can do that			2
those clubs immediately above them - @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity95 - are all on an upward trajectory and should have more than enough about them to ease in to mid-table at least			0
more realistically , @entity7 will be hoping to hunt down @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , all of whom are already five or six points clear of the @entity106			2
for a club bereft of confidence with just two wins under their belt this season , that is a big gap			0
@entity113 ( left ) apologises to the fans after the game and @entity116 ( right ) is sent off early on but if anyone can do it , it 's @entity7			2
speaking to @entity15 in september 2012 , the 40 - year - old 's passion for coaching and , more specifically , improving players - something he will have to do at @entity3 - was evident			1
' i 've been coaching for eight years now , which i think a lot of people do n't realise , ' @entity7 , now with 10 years ' experience , said			2
' when i finished at @entity130 at aged 30 i had about a month off and then went straight into coaching			0
' i looked back and realised i had had a good career , but i knew straight away that it would n't mean anything if i could n't coach			0
i might get away with it for a year or two , but it did n't mean anything to me really			0
' i thought , " right , i 've got to start again and learn my role , learn how to coach properly "			0
' that drive , passion and experience allows @entity7 to exude an infectious confidence that brings the best out in his players , or certainly has done at @entity145 for the past two - and - a - half years			1
@entity7 has been a resounding success at @entity145 , twice leading them to the @entity149 play - offs at the @entity150 , @entity7 made and maintained side noted for their organisation , consistency and professionalism , all things that @entity3 have lacked badly in recent years			1
@entity7 , who cites @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 as his biggest influences , was a defender in his playing days so will no doubt look to address @entity3 's backline as a priority			1
the @entity106 are conceding on average two goals per game - only @entity165 have conceded more than their 28 in the entire @entity166			0
perhaps most importantly of all , @entity167 has the personality and background to bring the fans back to @entity27 's			0
@entity3 's home form has been woeful for a couple of years now and @entity20 , with the exception of those final - day survival celebrations at @entity62 last season , never really connected with the fans			1
@entity20 was sacked earlier this month with @entity3 struggling in the relegation zone @entity7 should not have the same problem			1
he was popular in his time at the club as a player , playing in a period that @entity106 fans look back on fondly			0
another reason why moving for him makes perfect sense by a club whose decision - making has been questionable in recent times to say the least			0
you 'd still be a brave man to back @entity3 to stay up			2
but if anyone can do it , it 's @entity7			2
good week for ... @entity192			0
@entity194 's side made it six wins on the spin against @entity197 as a 19 - minute @entity199 hat - trick completed a remarkable comeback from 2 - 0 down			1
so good is @entity192 's form that they will go above unbeaten @entity202 at the top of @entity204 should they win their two games in hand			0
bad week for ... @entity145			2
not only are they losing their manager , the @entity207 somehow managed to contrive to lose to @entity209 despite their hosts not having a single shot all game on saturday			0
a late @entity214 own goal settled it as @entity7 's former side , who had five shots , slipped to third in the @entity149 table			1
talent scout : @entity221 ( @entity63 ) @entity63 's revival under @entity60 gathered pace on friday night with a 3 - 0 win over @entity226 rivals @entity130			1
the @entity227 were sensational in the first half with @entity229 midfielder @entity221 epitomising their energy , speed and accuracy when passing the ball			0
if @entity63 had blooded youngsters such as the 20 - year - old @entity221 last season they might just have stayed up			0
@entity221 looks like a highly talented player in @entity63 's midfield			0

@entity145 confirmed on monday @entity7 is leaving them for @entity3
@entity7 leaves @entity145 in third place in @entity149
@entity3 23rd in @entity70 after 8 - 0 defeat by @entity14
@entity20 sacked by @entity3 earlier this month
