it was this that inspired them to say ' i do ' surrounded by friends and family wearing wigs and luminous colours			0
@entity5 said : ' our wedding had a sixties theme with a strong @entity12 focus			2
it was a joint decision , we had been to weddings before and they were all very serious and i felt quite uncomfortable and i did n't want to feel like that on our day			0
' i wanted a relaxed atmosphere , and we both love the @entity12 , so it made sense , and our first date was @entity12 - themed			1
it was a common interest and something we both liked and it brought us together			0
' @entity4 and @entity5 's wedding cake was based on the @entity62 's 1969 album @entity24 , which features the iconic shot of the @entity34 walking over a northwest @entity78 zebra crossing the band 's iconic 1969 @entity24 album cover , upon which the @entity31 's wedding cake was based			2
@entity5 explained : ' when i first met up with @entity4 in @entity18 we went on a trip to find all the @entity12 places , like @entity98			1
' so @entity4 and his three friends dressed up in the @entity12 outfits , and then four of our friends dressed up in their earlier costumes of grey suits and wigs			2
' she added : we had all of our tables named after @entity12 ' albums and we had a band that played some of their hits			1
' everyone made a huge effort and was dressed up - it was fantastic and brilliant fun			0
' ' when the guests were coming in we had 60s music playing , and i had eight bridesmaids which i requested to wear go - go outfits : short , really bright dresses			0
i thought it would be dodgy but they were all fine about it			0
' some of the guests went to fancy dress shops and made a huge effort - everyone was dressed up			0
