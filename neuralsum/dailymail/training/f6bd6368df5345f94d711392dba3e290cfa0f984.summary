a man has told how he can not stay sober - as everything he eats turns to alcohol			0
@entity3 suffers from a bizarre condition that causes his stomach to brew alcohol every time he tucks into a bag of crisps , sandwich or even a fizzy drink			2
the 34 - year - old was born with an in - body brewery that went undetected for 20 years meaning he spent years being ' drunk ' after eating highly starchy or sugary foods - even when he was at primary school			1
as a result , he is often bed - bound and suffers from exhaustion			0
teetotal mr @entity3 , of @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ‘ every time i eat bread , potatoes or starchy rice i produce 100 per cent proof drinking alcohol that travels around my body through my bloodstream - if i eat a portion of rice i would suffer a hangover equivalent of having glugged three bottles of red wine the night before			1
‘ i have experienced symptoms from birth and during my childhood there were countless times i suffered ' drunkenness ' without having consumed an alcoholic beverage			0
‘ i was a stubborn teenager and wanted a normal life so i insisted on partying and drinking and after sailing through my gcses i had to scrape through my a-levels to go to university			0
‘ but soon after starting i dropped out - i had noticed i was getting drunk more easily and was suffering severe hangovers after most meals			2
mr @entity3 ( pictured with his partner , @entity59 ) has to stick to a very natural diet of meat , fish , vegetables and nuts			1
even when on this diet , he wakes up with a hangover every morning ‘ drinking alcohol is now a big no - i already have my own personal brewery and the body was not designed to handle even more alcohol			1
‘ plus , why pay someone else when i can make my own special brew			0
’ mr @entity3 suffers from auto - brewery syndrome , where an overgrowth of yeast in his small intestine produces pure ethanol that is then absorbed directly into the bloodstream			1
the condition is aggravated by eating processed food or those which are starchy and sugary			2
to manage the condition , he has to stick to a very natural diet of meat , fish and vegetables			1
due to the huge quantity of alcohol in mr @entity3 's body , he suffers from chronic alcohol poisoning and has liver disease			2
this means he is often bed - ridden and exhausted however , he experiences some symptoms even on this diet			1
while studying for his a-levels , mr @entity3 ’s condition became more severe and he would often experience ' drunken ' affects , such as dizziness , nausea and even aggression , during classes			2
he said : ‘ i would start feeling intoxicated a few hours after having something to eat as my body began digesting it			0
‘ i 'm usually quite a shy and quiet person and had a lot of friends at school , but there were times when i would act like a raging drunk by saying horrible things to people , slurring words , upsetting people and just stirring up trouble			0
mr @entity3 has suffered from the condition since he was a child ( pictured ) and struggled at school as he often experienced symptoms of drunkenness , such as nausea , dizziness and aggression ‘ my parents were baffled by my behaviour			1
i had always been a quiet , sensible child and even as a teenager i was never prone to being moody or stroppy			0
‘ but suddenly i started acting like @entity125 the teenager , from @entity126 and chums			0
’ the complexity of mr @entity3 ’s condition baffled @entity130 doctors , who insisted he visit a psychiatrist as a result of regularly missing school			2
but he eventually sought private help from specialists in @entity136 and @entity137			0
his family spent their entire £ 50,000 savings trying to have @entity3 's condition identified and it was n't until a blood test showed abnormally high levels of ethanol and other alcohols present , indicating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , that a diagnosis was made			1
it was years before mr @entity3 was diagnosed - the condition was only picked up when a blood test revealed he had high levels of ethanol in his blood even though he had not been drinking mr @entity3 added : ‘ i finally recognised i 'd been suffering auto - brewery syndrome all these years after reading a book about a @entity157 man who was arrested by police for drunk - driving despite insisting he was teetotal			1
‘ it explained that an overgrowth of yeast in the gut could cause this - along with all the symptoms i had suffered for so many years			1
‘ i now understood that i had my very own brewery in my gut that was poisoning my body and mind			0
’ the illness has had a devastating impact on mr @entity3 ’s life - he is unable to hold down a job and pursue a career as a nutritional therapist			1
he also has to adhere to a strict diet in order to manage the fermentation in his gut - the vast majority of common foods , drinks and snacks are off the menu , along with fast food and takeaways			1
mr @entity3 ( pictured on holiday with his sister ) can not work because of his illness and he often has too little energy to leave the house mr @entity3 even went to @entity137 ( pictured ) in his attempt to find a diagnosis and treatment for his condition mr @entity3 , who lives with girlfriend @entity16 , is forced to stay home as a result of having little or no energy on a daily basis - but he did set up the @entity199 website to help fellow sufferers			1
and 26 - year - old @entity59 ensures that there are no tempting snacks or banned foods in the cupboards to tease him into breaking his regime			2
mr @entity206 , a teacher , said : ‘ we are able to go out for meals as a couple but not as often as we would both like			0
‘ i watched other friends in their “ normal ” relationships and did feel envious of what they had but this made me fight for @entity3 and make him realise that his syndrome should not dictate his future happiness			1
‘ he would never control or tell me what to do but i do n't want to sit and eat or have things in the house that would make him feel tempted or negative about the foods he has to stick to			2
mr @entity3 ( pictured , left , with a friend ) said : ' every time i eat bread , potatoes or starchy rice i produce 100 per cent proof drinking alcohol that travels around my body through my bloodstream - if i eat a portion of rice i would suffer a hangover equivalent of having glugged three bottles of red wine the night before ' ‘ we both enjoy living active lifestyles but due to his condition he is n't able to participate much - so quite often i have to go the gym or do recreational activities alone			1
’ mr @entity3 ’s condition is so severe , that usual treatment procedures of anti-fungal medications , probiotic supplements and selected nutritional supplements do not prevent the production of alcohol			2
he has been left to manage the level of fermentation himself with only vitamin and minerals to help			0
he said : ‘ we now have no savings left and even if we did are at a loss as to how to regain my health - the most precious gift a human being is endowed with			0
mr @entity3 ( pictured with a friend ) says it is frustrating that he has spent thousands of pounds looking for a diagnosis and then a treatment but that he still has no way of curing his condition ‘ i must typically eat a natural diet based on meat , fish , eggs , seeds and vegetables and drink only pure water and herbal teas			1
‘ this is extremely difficult at first and would no doubt be impossible for most people , yet the consequences of eating a more conventional diet are even worse with a brewery in your gut			0
‘ it 's a frightening amount of money we 've spent and the fact i have not been effectively treated as a result is the real kick in the teeth			0
auto - brewery syndrome , also known as gut fermentation syndrome , is a rare condition which causes the digestive system to produce alcohol through fermentation			1
it causes a person to become drunk when they have not consumed alcohol			0
it is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the intestines			0
very little is known about the condition but a number of cases have been cited in medical literature .			0

@entity3 has auto - brewery syndrome - an overgrowth of yeast in his small intestine produces ethanol from sugary and starchy foods
he is frequently ' drunk ' and wakes up with a hangover every morning
has to stick to a natural diet of meat , fish , vegetables and nuts
this does not *eliminate* his symptoms but reduces the problem
