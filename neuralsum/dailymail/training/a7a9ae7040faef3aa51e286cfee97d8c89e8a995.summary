it has generally been agreed that northern @entity1 underwent desertification about 3 million years ago , leading to the formation of the @entity4			1
but now scientists at it may be twice as old as thought , with desertification starting around 7 million years ago			2
climate simulations suggest the shrinking of the @entity10 coupled with the uplift of the @entity12 weakened the summer monsoon , forming the vast desert that exists today much longer ago than thought			1
research led by the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity15 suggests the age of the @entity4 ( shown ) is double previous estimates			1
evidence had suggested that some dunes in @entity23 , part of the @entity4 desert , were as much as 7 million years old the research , published in @entity27 , was co-authored by dr @entity28 , a palaeoclimatologist at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity15			1
the evidence comes partially from dune deposits in northern chad that were estimated to be seven million years old			0
other studies also found evidence for extended dry spells in the region starting eight million years ago			0
the reason why this was so was not known , but now dr @entity28 says he may have an answer			0
his team ’s climate simulations suggest a gradual rearrangement of land masses in northern @entity1			1
the @entity4 desert is one of the largest deserts in the world and covers more than 3.5 million square miles ( 9 million square km ) - 10 per cent of the @entity1 continent			1
it is bordered by the @entity49 in the east and the @entity51 in the west the desert covers parts of several @entity1 nations including @entity56 , @entity23 , @entity57 and @entity58			0
about a quarter of the desert is made of dunes , with some of them reaching more than 150 metres ( 500 ft ) in height			0
one permanent river runs through the @entity4 today - the @entity65			0
one particular shift was thought to occur in the @entity10 that once bordered northern @entity1			2
the sea gradually shrunk around seven to 11 million years ago , and it ’s thought this may have weakened the @entity1 summer monsoon			1
the uplift of the @entity12 peninsula was also thought to play a part			0
the quelling of the monsoon would in turn have weakened westerly winds , shifting a flow of moisture from the tropical @entity51 further south			0
this suggests the desertification , and ultimately the formation of the @entity4 desert , may have formed earlier than thought			2
‘ not only did the @entity10 shrinkage alter the mean climate of the region , it also enhanced the sensitivity of the @entity1 monsoon to orbital forcing , which subsequently became the major driver of @entity4 extent fluctuations , ’ the researchers write			0
‘ these important climatic changes probably caused the shifts in @entity98 and @entity1 flora and fauna observed during the same period			0
' climate simulations suggest the shrinking of a body of water called the @entity10 ( shown ) may have weakened the @entity1 summer monsoon			1
this led to the desertification of northern @entity1 earlier than thought			2
the @entity4 desert is one of the world 's largest deserts and covers about 10 per cent of the @entity1 continent			1

research led by the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity15 suggests the age of the @entity4 desert is double previous estimates
evidence had suggested that some dunes in @entity23 , part of the @entity4 desert , were as much as 7 million years old
but it had been thought the @entity4 desert was only 3 million years old
now climate simulations suggest the shrinking of a body of water called the @entity10 may have weakened the @entity1 summer monsoon
this led to the desertification of northern @entity1 earlier than thought
today the @entity4 desert is one of the world 's largest deserts and covers about 10 per cent of the @entity1 continent
