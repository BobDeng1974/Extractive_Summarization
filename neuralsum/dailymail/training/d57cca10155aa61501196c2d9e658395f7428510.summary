@entity0 , 58 , went from a £ 50,000 job to living on benefits after he started playing fixed odds betting terminals ( @entity10 ) - blowing up to £ 3,000 per day			1
the businessman had led a lavish lifestyle back in 2001 , enjoying well - paid jobs in e-commerce which allowed him to own a @entity15			0
he had also just moved in with a new girlfriend			2
but mr @entity0 , from @entity17 , @entity18 lost it all after becoming addicted to playing roulette on the controversial machines , dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling and which rake in £ 1.5 billion - a - year in profit for bookmakers			1
surprisingly , he did n't start betting until he was 45 , but 10 years later was a broken man both financially and emotionally			2
@entity0 said : ' these fixed odds betting terminals destroy you			1
i became addicted instantly after a friend who played the machines asked me to pop into a bookies one day and have a go			1
after that , all i thought about all day was gambling			1
' i worked to go on these machines and could spend up to 12 hours a day in there			1
i used to get up early and go in to the bookies before i went to work , at lunchtime and would go straight into one after work			0
' within 10 years i had lost £ 200,000 , a relationship and my home as well			1
' my whole personality changed			0
i became very introverted , made excuses not to see family and friends			0
you can lose hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes with a few spins ' file picture mr @entity0 finally sought help after moving from @entity58 to live in @entity17 in 2011 after getting in touch with the @entity60 , which helps gamblers break the habit			2
he said : ' they helped me with my cognitive behaviour , helping to try and sort out my distorted thought patterns			0
going there probably saved my life and i have n't gambled for three years			0
' the machines , of which there are 33,000 in betting shops across the country , have been blamed for a rise in problem gambling and have also been linked to money laundering			1
they account for around half of bookmakers ’ profits but betting shop managers have anonymously told the mail of the toll they take on customers and staff			2
regular players are ‘ like zombies ’ , the managers said , giving examples of how customers could attack staff and vandalise shops when they lose money			0
a recent poll found that three in four voters wanted a ban on the machines			0
mr @entity0 has now set up a charity called @entity97 to raise awareness of the dangers of gambling and to campaign against the @entity10 terminals			1
his charity , which launches in november , will campaign for a reduction in the maximum stake on the machines , currently set at £ 100 every 20 seconds			1
the charity is also behind @entity106 taking place between december 1 and 7			0
he said ' fobts are so dangerous			0
you can lose hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes with a few spins			0
' bookies have taken advantage of a loophole in the tax system			0
bookies have been able to argue that feeding money into a @entity10 is like betting on a horse race since the ' event ' you are gambling on is happening on a computer server elsewhere			2
' this allows them to set a maximum stake of £ 100 , as opposed to the £ 2 maximum on machines in arcades			2

@entity0 , 58 , had a home , sports car and girlfriend before addiction
he blew up to £ 3,000 a day on controversial betting machines for a decade
now he has *conquered* addiction and is setting up a gambling charity
