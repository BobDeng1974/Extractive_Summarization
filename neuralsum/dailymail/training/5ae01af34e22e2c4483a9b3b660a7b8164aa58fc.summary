@entity0 is doubling down on his controversial comments about ' black - on - black crime , ' saying he saved thousands of @entity4 lives by cutting the murder rate during his tenure at @entity8 's mayor			1
' the danger to a black child in @entity11 is not a white police officer			1
that 's going to happen less than 1percent of the time , ' he told @entity15 this morning			0
' the danger to a black child , if it was my child , is another black - 93percent of the time it 's going to be another black			2
' @entity0 is under fire for comments he made on ' @entity23 ' on sunday during a heated argument about race and crime in @entity11			2
during a discussion about the protests over a white police officer shooting dead an unarmed black teen in @entity31 , @entity32 , he told @entity34 professor @entity33 : ' white police officers would n’t be there if you were n’t killing each other			1
' others quickly chimed in online to say that the 70 - year - old 's comments were racist			0
@entity0 is refusing to soften his stance			0
in an interview today on @entity52 he said that by reducing the violent crime rate - and the number of @entity4 being murdered in @entity8 - he did far more for the black community than black pundits and activists			1
he further implied that dr @entity33 was a racist for focusing on the shooting in @entity31 and not ' black - on - black crime			2
' ' it 's a matter of whether you want to be some kind of racial demagogue , who i consider a racist , which many of these people are ... or whether you want to be fair and decent and really save people 's lives , ' he said			0
he unabashedly defended his record as @entity8 mayor			1
@entity74 plummeted dramatically during his tenure from 1994 to 2001			0
' i probably saved more black lives in this city than any mayor in the history of @entity8 , with the possible exception of @entity82 , who was there for 12 years , ' he said			1
sound off : @entity0 appeared on @entity23 and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of @entity31 to say white cops would n't be needed ' if you were n't killing each other ' ' we 've tried to make the police force of @entity8 as proportionate as we possibly can			1
we go out of our way to do that			0
i think we do a pretty good job , not a perfect job			0
' he quickly diverted from that subject , arguing with @entity45 contributor and @entity34 professor @entity33 about black crime			0
' i find it very disappointing that you 're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in @entity11 are killed by other blacks , ' said @entity0			1
@entity0 did not mention the source used , though a study from the @entity108 found in reported crimes from 2005 , 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black			1
the study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person			1
@entity33 pushed back against @entity0 , calling the link made by the mayor a ' false equivalency			0
' ' first of all , most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail , ' @entity33 said			0
back and forth : on a segment about racially proportionate police , @entity0 first stated he worked to keep a balanced force , then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods ' number two , they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law , ' he added			1
@entity0 took off his glasses and cut in to argue for more police in black neighborhoods as @entity33 questioned officers ' ability to effectively police those communities			2
' the police presence can not make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals , ' he stated			0
the segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while @entity149 , attorney for @entity151 's family , sat silent , before @entity0 capped his rant			0
' why do n’t you cut it down so so many white police officers do n’t have to be in black areas ? ' @entity0 shouted			2
' the white police officers would n’t be there if you were n’t killing each other			2

the former @entity8 mayor was on @entity23 to talk about racially proportionate police forces
he *proclaimed* it was ' very disappointing ' the *conversation* was n't about blacks killing blacks
a study from the @entity108 found in 2005 , 93 percent of black *homicide* victims were killed by another black person
the same study found 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person
