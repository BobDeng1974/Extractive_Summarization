by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 13:52 est , 27 august 2013 @entity2 stylist @entity1 has taught women all over the world how to look good naked , but has now found himself in hot water down under by trying to get ladies to cover up			1
appearing in an @entity9 tv commercial for bras from clothing giant @entity11 , the bespectacled fashion guru generated viewer complaints to the @entity13 for referring to breasts as ' bangers ' and ' assets ' , which some people found ' offensive ' and ' degrading '			1
' critics complained the advert was demeaning and compared women to meat , while others were disappointed that the campaign featured a gay man			0
one said : ' i have never called , or even heard another woman , or man for that matter , refer to women 's breasts as bangers , bangers are a slang term for a sausage , i do not want my breast referred to as meat			1
' but @entity11 said the ' playful ' ad stood parallel with brand values : ' it contains words used in common parlance , such as ' assets ' to encourage women to think about themselves in positive terms			1
' the term ' bangers ' is used in wry acceptance that not everyone thinks about their breasts in positive terms			1
it is an irreverent term of affection			0
' speaking about their choice of star for the campaign , they commented on @entity89 : ' he feels good about who he is as he is			0
he is playfully irreverent , colourful and fun			0
he has a great capacity for making other people feel good about themselves too			2
' @entity11 strongly believes that a person 's sexuality is irrelevant to their worth as a person			0
@entity11 makes no apology for using a gay man in its advertising			0
' despite complaints about @entity1 's use of the word ' bangers ' , the @entity13 decided there was no breach of code , commenting that the advert 's overall tone was ' positive and lighthearted ' the @entity13 said : ' the board considered the term ' bangers ' and recognised that some members of the community may be offended by the reference to women 's breasts as bangers			1
' the board considered that the word is not commonly used in @entity9 in this manner but that in this instance , it is not used in a derogatory way and that the use of the term bangers is one that is used by @entity1 as part of his programs and persona			2
' the board considered that the term ' bangers ' is not inappropriate and not strong or obscene language in this context			2
' the term has since been replaced with ' boobs ' , a more commonplace @entity9 term for breasts .			0
