by @entity0 wind turbines could warm local climates up to ten times faster than the natural rate , a study has shown			0
air temperatures around four of the world ’s largest wind farms have increased by up to 0.72c in a decade , researchers have found			1
in contrast , @entity10 ’s average temperature has warmed by only @entity12 since 1900			1
in a spin : researchers found air temperatures around four of the world 's largest wind farms had increased by up to 0.72c in a decade			1
in contrast , @entity10 's average temperature has warmed by only @entity12 since 1900 as more wind farms are built , temperature increases may have a long - term impact on wildlife and regional weather patterns , with experts warning that the effects from large farms could alter wind and rainfall patterns			1
scientists at the @entity29 at @entity30 studied satellite data of the areas around the wind farms , in @entity34 , from 2003 to 2011			2
publishing their findings in the scientific journal nature , they said : ‘ we attribute this warming primarily to wind farms			2
‘ the temperature change could be due to the effects of the energy expelled by farms and the movement and turbulence generated by turbine rotors			0
‘ these changes , if spatially large enough , may have noticeable impacts on local to regional weather and climate			0
’ but they warned that firm conclusions should not be drawn until more research had been carried out			0
as more wind farms are built , temperature increases may have a long - term impact on wildlife and regional weather patterns some scientists have suggested that giant wind farms , comprising hundreds of thousands of turbines , would not only alter the weather but could be used to control it			1
@entity63 currently has about 3,500 wind turbines , but there are plans to increase this to 10,000 onshore machines and 4,300 offshore by 2020			0
the world ’s wind farms last year had the capacity to produce 238 gigawatts of electricity at any one time – a 21 per cent rise on 2010			2
capacity is expected to reach nearly 500 gigawatts by the end of 2016 as more turbines are built , according to the @entity78 .			0

air temperatures around four of the world 's largest wind farms have increased by @entity83 in a decade
@entity10 's average temperature has risen by @entity12 since 1900
