scientists have identified what they believe is the key to wrinkle free skin , raising hopes for creams and treatments that could defy aging			1
in a 20 - week tanning experiment , they found that mice who lacked the enzyme @entity11 had aged significantly less than than those who had it			1
the researchers found that they also had noticeably smoother skin and their collagen was more intact			1
the secret to wrinkle - free skin may lie in blocking an enzyme called @entity11 , scientists believe incredibly the discovery was made by accident as the researchers were looking into the role of @entity11 in atherosclerosis and heart attacks			1
during their experiments they happened to notice the difference in the quality of the skin on the different groups of mice			2
lead researcher @entity33 of the @entity34 said : ‘ this is one of those moments that we live for in science			0
‘ we were interested in the effects of aging on blood vessels ; we had no idea ( the absence of this enzyme ) would have any effect on their skin			2
’ professor @entity33 added that his team was developing drugs that can block @entity11 - and hoped to make them commercially available soon			2
he said : ‘ we have generated natural and synthetic inhibitors of this enzyme and one can easily see the application for this after excessive sun exposure ... or in other cosmetics as well			0
‘ that ’s obviously the first thing that comes to mind ’			0
the research team created a miniature tanning salon for the mice in the experiment and each mouse was put on a carousel that turned under @entity65 lamps			0
the animals were exposed to the light three times a week for three to four minutes each session , which was enough to make them red but not to burn			0
by week 20 , it was clear that the mice who had been engineered to lack @entity11 had pristine skin - but the control group had wrinkles			1
professor @entity33 said : ‘ about 80 to 90 per cent of visible skin aging is caused by sunlight			2
‘ we found that by knocking out ( @entity11 ) we could markedly protect against the loss of collagen and it prevented wrinkling in these mice			1
’ scientists hope creams and treatments that could defy aging may come from the discovery @entity11 appears to work by interfering with the the integrity of collagen and dismantling the ‘ cellular scaffolding ’ that binds its cells together			1
this results in structural weakness which we see on the surface as wrinkles			0
exposure to sunlight appears to increase the level of @entity11 , thus accelerating its harmful effect on the skin			2
professor @entity33 said that many anti-aging cosmetics include collagen which consumers apply to the skin even though it does very little			0
he said : ‘ by adding collagen without putting out the fire , you are just adding wood to the fire			0
‘ this offers an actual realistic solution , where you can inhibit the enzyme that is leading to the breakdown of collagen			0
’ professor @entity33 ’s @entity116 company , @entity115 , is currently working on a lotion that will stop sores and burns caused by too much sun. and whilst the experiment worked in mice who were bred to have no @entity11 at all , in humans things are more complicated as the enzyme it is part of the immune system and removing it may have unintended consequences .			1

mice who lacked the enzyme @entity11 aged significantly less
also had noticeably smoother skin and their collagen was more intact
discovery was made by accident as the researchers were looking into the role of @entity11 in *hardening* of the *arteries* and heart attacks
scientists hope treatments that could defy aging may come from discovery
