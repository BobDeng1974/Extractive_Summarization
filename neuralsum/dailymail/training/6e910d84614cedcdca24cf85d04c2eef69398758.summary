by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:55 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 03:55 est , 16 october 2013 prison staff are to be issued with stab - proof vests to wear round the clock under plans being considered by ministers			1
an urgent review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘ covert clothing ’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners			1
the number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade , with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights			0
protection : prison officers could be given stab - proof vests to wear as part of their routine uniform ( file picture ) the idea of giving all prison staff stab - proof vests marks a significant u-turn , coming just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary			1
protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety			0
last year there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in @entity41 and @entity42 involving a knife or blade , up from 127 in 2002			0

growing problem : there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in @entity41 and @entity42 involving a knife or blade last year , up from 127 in 2002 he insisted that there @entity60 has a ‘ zero tolerance approach to violence within prisons and takes the safety of prison staff extremely seriously ’			2
mr @entity59 added : ‘ @entity80 must be able to undertake their duties safely and be , as far as possible , protected from attack			0
‘ @entity60 is currently assessing the benefits and feasibility of issuing front - line prison staff with covert clothing for routine wear , including vests which offer protection from knife slashing or stabbing			1
‘ knife - resistant vests and other protective clothing are already provided to staff where a particular risk has been identified , including to specialist staff responding to serious incidents			2
’ he was responding to a parliamentary question from @entity103 mp @entity102 , who also urged ministers to consider the use of slash and needle - proof gloves by all prison guards			2
mr @entity59 replied : ‘ @entity110 - resistant and needle - resistant search gloves are currently available for staff use and local risk - assessment at individual prisons determines how widely they are used			2
‘ work is on - going to identify further suitable products which may benefit prison staff in conducting routine searches			0
