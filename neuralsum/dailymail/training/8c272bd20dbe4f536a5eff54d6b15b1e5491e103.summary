her husband @entity30 told @entity31 he is considering taking legal action , adding : ' it 's unbelievable that a company of this size did n't recall the irons as soon as they knew about the problem over a year ago			1
' but managing director @entity38 defended the decision and said : ' i would like to apologise to the people that have been injured by one of these irons			1
' this absolutely was not our intention and we work very hard as a brand to ensure that we bring products to market that are fit for purpose			2
' a statement on the @entity1 website says : ' as part of our ongoing quality monitoring program , we 've identified an issue with a small number of our irons , that may carry a risk that the flex may fail			2
' if you do have an affected iron , please stop using it immediately			1
' the @entity1 website warns : ' if you do have an affected iron , please stop using it immediately ' angry customers posted pictures to the @entity69 including complainants who say their iron caught fire while they were using it			1
@entity73 wrote : ' just want to warn people of potential danger my husband was ironing today when it caught fire and burnt him			1
' lucky he quickly threw it to the floor ( damaging our kitchen floor ) could of been a lot worse '			0
she later added that customer services had been ' fantastic ' in handling her complaint			0
another customer , @entity88 , posted a picture to the @entity91 page of her injured hand after using the iron in august			1
she wrote : ' today when using the @entity95 iron it suddenly sparked and has burnt my hand badly			2

' @entity1 have apologised to customers for any inconvenience caused and are offering a replacement or refund			2
mr @entity38 added the flex in question is no longer being used			0
he said : ' when the problems , however isolated , with the particular flex that was being used in a few batches of our irons became apparent , we started working with @entity133 to monitor the situation			2
' we take our responsibilities as a manufacturer very seriously and customer safety is always our first priority , and it is because of these factors that we decided to issue the product recall			0
' a company spokesman said : ' the company 's primary concern is , as ever , for the safety of their consumers			2
@entity1 has always taken their responsibilities as a manufacturer extremely seriously			0
' the decision to recall these products has been taken with the utmost consideration for the public			1
' @entity1 say customers with one of these models should also check the batch code , which is written at the bottom of the label			1
they say : ' if it starts with 045 through to 365 and ends with 12 or starts with 001 through to 195 and ends with 13 , then you have an affected iron			0
