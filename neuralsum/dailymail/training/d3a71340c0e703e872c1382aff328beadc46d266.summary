@entity0 today admitted he made a mistake by taking @entity2 into @entity3 as his chief spin doctor			1
the prime minister issued a ' full and frank ' apology for his decision to hire the former editor of the @entity9 , adding : ' i am extremely sorry i employed him			1
it was the wrong decision			1
' labour leader @entity12 said that mr @entity0 had ' brought a criminal into the heart of @entity3 ' and his government was ' tainted ' as a result			2
@entity2 has been found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper			2
the jury is still considering further charges against @entity2 and former @entity34 royal editor @entity33 of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office by paying police officers for two royal directories			2
in a recorded statement in the @entity40 today , mr @entity0 said : ' i always said that if they turned out to be wrong i would make a full and frank apology and i do that today			1
' i 'm extremely sorry that i employed him , it was the wrong decision and i 'm very clear about that			1
' pressed on the assurances he sought before hiring @entity2 , the @entity0 added : ' i asked him questions , if he knew about phone hacking and he said that he did n't and i accepted those assurances and i gave him the job			1
' i would say that no - one has made any complaints about the work that he did for me either as leader of the opposition or indeed here in @entity40			0
' but knowing what i now know and knowing that those assurances were n't right , it was obviously wrong to employ him			2
' i gave someone a second chance and it turned out to be a bad decision			2
' mr @entity0 walked off camera and left the room without answering the final question from his interviewer , @entity68 political editor @entity67 , who asked : ' on a human level do you feel sorry for him ? ' within minutes of the guilty verdict against @entity2 being announced , the issue was raised in the @entity73			1
chancellor @entity74 , a cheerleader for hiring @entity2 on the @entity23 staff , was accused of bringing the government into disrepute			1
labour leader @entity12 said : ' i think @entity0 has very , very serious questions to answer , because we now know that he brought a criminal into the heart of @entity3			0
' @entity0 was warned about @entity2 , the evidence mounted up against @entity2			1
@entity0 must have had his suspicions about @entity2 , and yet he refused to act			1
' now , i believe this is n't just a serious error of judgment			0
this taints @entity0 's government , because we now know that he put his relationship with @entity91 ahead of doing the right thing when it came to @entity2			1
' this was not some small or accidental mistake			0
he stuck with @entity2 over a long period of time , and it was n't like there was n't information out there to arouse his suspicions			0
he was warned by the deputy prime minister			0
he saw front page stories in newspapers			0
he was warned by newspaper editors			0
and yet still he refused to act and even today defended some of the conduct of @entity2 when he worked for him			0
' i think @entity0 must do much more than an apology			2
he owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on these allegations against @entity2 , why as the evidence piled up he did n't do anything about it , and he 's got to explain			2
' the @entity116 ' decision to take on @entity2 was always controversial , coming after his resignation from the @entity9			1
he publicly denied any knowledge of phone - hacking at the newspaper , but quit taking responsibility for the single case of royal editor @entity33 who was jailed for phone hacking			0
chancellor @entity74 was among the key figures who pushed for @entity2 to be hired by the @entity116 when the @entity116 formed a coalition with the @entity128 , @entity2 moved from @entity129 to @entity3 as the government 's director of communications			1
but renewed questions about phone - hacking emerged in 2009 , leading to calls for mr @entity0 to sack his close aide			0
amid mounting pressure , he stayed in post until january 2011 , when he quit			0
in july that year , mr @entity0 promised to apologise if @entity2 was found guilty of wrongdoing			1
he told @entity139 : ' i have said very clearly that if it turns out @entity2 knew about the hacking at the @entity9 he will not only have lied to me but he will have lied to the police , to a select committee , to the @entity145 and , of course , perjured himself in a court of law			1
' more to the point , if that comes to pass , he could also expect to face severe criminal charges			0
' i have an old fashioned view about ' innocent until proven guilty '			0
but if it turns out i have been lied to , that would be a moment for a profound apology			2
' and , in that event , i can tell you i will not fall short			0
' @entity160 's shadow chancellor @entity159 accused @entity74 of bringing the @entity161 into disrepute by pushing for the @entity116 to hire @entity2 in 2007 in the @entity163 , @entity160 's @entity159 challenged mr @entity74 about his role in pushing for the @entity116 to hire @entity2 as the party 's communications director			1
mr @entity159 said : ' does the chancellor now accept that it was a terrible error of judgement ... ' but he was cut off by commons speaker @entity170 , who warned the question was not relevant to @entity161 questions			0
allowed another attempt at raising the issue , mr @entity159 went on : ' does the chancellor accept that he has brought into disrepute the office of chancellor and of the @entity161 by urging the prime minister for his own reasons to bring mr @entity2 into government and has he not done damage to his own reputation and the government 's ? ' mr @entity74 brushed the comments aside , taking a swipe at mr balls own background in the @entity160 spin operation			1
' the person who worked alongside @entity189 is not a person to give lectures on this , ' he said , in reference to mr @entity189 having to resign from @entity195 's government for plotting smears			0
in a statement later mr @entity74 said : ' i too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ @entity2			1
' he gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case			2
we gave him a second chance but , knowing what we now know , it 's clear that we made the wrong decision			1
' it 's important for the victims of phone hacking that this has now been properly dealt with by the courts ; and it matters for us all that we have a free and vibrant press which operates within the law			0
' during his trial , @entity2 admitted that he never told the @entity116 he knew of the hacking of @entity160 home secretary @entity218 's voicemail in 2004 because , if he had come clean , he probably would not have got the job			2
the 46 - year - old maintained that he thought chief reporter @entity221 was responsible and not @entity222			0
in his earlier evidence to the @entity224 in 2012 , @entity2 said mr @entity0 asked him about the @entity33 case			1
he told the inquiry : ' i said to him what i said publicly - i knew nothing in terms of what they did			0
' mr @entity0 did not seek any more assurances over @entity2 's links to phone hacking , despite allegations about legal pay - offs for victims being published in the @entity240 in july 2009 , the inquiry heard			1
instead , the prime minister stood by his spokesman long after the first rumblings in the media that all the hacking at the @entity34 had not been exposed			0
labour leader @entity12 said that mr @entity0 had ' brought a criminal into the heart of @entity3 ' and his government was ' tainted ' as a result @entity2 ( centre ) checks his phone during the @entity23 party conference in 2009 , the year before he entered @entity3 running the government 's spin operation when @entity2 resigned as mr @entity0 's media adviser in january 2011 , he said : ' unfortunately , continued coverage of events connected to my old job at the @entity9 has made it difficult for me to give the 110 per cent needed in this role			1
' the prime minister reacted by saying he was ' very sorry ' that @entity2 was ' compelled ' to resign because of the continuing pressure over phone hacking			0
after that , @entity2 said he met up with mr @entity0 one more time in the spring of that year at a pre-arranged social event and had not spoken to him since			2
mr @entity0 told the @entity163 in an emergency statement in 2011 that he took ' responsibility ' for @entity2 's recruitment			1
' with 20:20 hindsight - and all that has followed - i would not have offered him the job and i expect that he would n't have taken it , ' he said			0
' on the work he did , i will repeat , perhaps not for the last time , that his work at @entity3 has not been the subject of any serious complaint			0

@entity0 stands by 2011 promise to issue ' profound apology ' if @entity2 guilty
speaking in the @entity284 room , @entity0 admits : ' it was the wrong decision '
