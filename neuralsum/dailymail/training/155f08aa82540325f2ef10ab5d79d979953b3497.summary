by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 had reduced a hostile @entity3 to the silence of the lambs after two sets of an extraordinary @entity8 quarter - final as he overwhelmed local hero @entity9			1
many of the @entity12 ’s fellow @entity11 filed out to find dinner or somewhere warm , disillusioned by the inferiority of their man			0
within an hour , those left were roaring @entity9 towards a fifth set — only to end up wondering why they had bothered			2
at 9.41pm , @entity2 completed the second turnaround of a bewildering contest by rampaging through an unlikely final set in just 24 minutes to go through 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , 4 - 6 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 0 in three hours and 15 minutes			1
on friday the 27 - year - old @entity22 has a repeat of his 2011 semi-final against @entity25 , who somehow managed to finish earlier after losing the first set			1
he came back to defeat @entity27 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 , but at least he will not have the advantage of an extra day ’s rest , as had seemed probable			1
pumped up : @entity2 celebrates as he beats @entity12 @entity9 in a deciding fifth set good game , good game : the two protagonists shake hands after a match that will live long in the memory that was a relatively routine affair compared to the madness being played out on the main arena , the type that comes from having two of the world ’s most enigmatic performers facing off			1
@entity2 played superbly at the start , sticking to a clever gameplan to deny @entity9 the pace he loves but then opening his shoulders to thump winners when the opportunity arose			1
it was hard to recall his backhand down the line ever having been so devastating			0
to @entity9 ’s credit , he turned it around , and the debate became whether this would be the first time since 2005 , when @entity2 was a callow 18 - year - old with brittle legs playing at his first @entity56 , that the @entity22 might lose a five - set match from 2 - 0 up			1
he has played 21 since , and that record stands intact after his explosive sprint to the finish line that came after he had looked down and out in the fourth set , complaining after its conclusion that he was being made to play on			2
day in the sun : @entity2 raced into a two - set lead but was pegged back by the unpredictable @entity9 serving up a treat : @entity2 was initially the aggressor but was pegged back by an inspired @entity9 in front of a partisan crowd the key to his transformation was breaking in the second game of a decider which began at 9.17pm with the light fading and the temperature dropping			1
suddenly it was @entity2 who wanted to continue and he went on to beat an opponent who had the energy sucked out of him			2
desperate to finish so as not to face playing on a fifth day out of six ahead of the @entity25 clash , he hit out freely while @entity9 , to the consternation of his supporters , failed to stem the haemorrhage of games in the gloaming			1
@entity9 said afterwards he had been happy to finish the match , while @entity2 insisted he was , too			1
‘ i was told we had 20 minutes left , a maximum of six games , ’ said the @entity22			2
‘ it was very dark at the end and thankfully he played a poor fifth set once i got ahead after really raising his level in the fourth			2
‘ it was tough conditions , very windy at the start and i began well			0
when the wind calmed down he began to play so much better			0
he ’s such an incredible athlete , he gets to so many balls			0
it ’s definitely a big achievement to have got this far but it ’s not what i came here to do			0
i set myself some big goals			0
’ it will be very difficult but the @entity2 of the first , second and fifth sets has a puncher ’s chance against @entity25			1
the one of the third and fourth faces a knockout			0
breathtaking : @entity2 was brilliant when push came to shove with @entity9 dazzling for two sets @entity2 had walked on to a mixture of the residual cheers for the preceding @entity9 , mixed in with boos to warn him of what might lie in store			1
his response was to smile , but the most effective way of shutting the previously rain - sodden 15,000 spectators out of the match would be with his racket , and that was what he proceeded to do			0
and for the second match in succession he sportingly conceded a point to his opponent , this time as he tried to close out the second set in a marathon game			0
a ball fell from his pocket as he blasted a forehand into the net and umpire @entity133 called a let			0
amid a cacophony of booing , the two players and the official held a mid-court conference , which ended with the @entity22 giving away the point , which he did not need to do			0
that became irrelevant as he went on to close it out on an eighth set point to put himself in full command and convince many of @entity9 ’s fans that this was no longer worth the bother			2
flashpoint : @entity2 and @entity9 argue with the umpire as temperatures get a little heated on court power : @entity9 hits a forehand as he fights back from two sets down to level the match the deserters missed @entity9 digging in admirably , cutting down on the forehand misses and orchestrating those loyal stayers to get behind him once he had saved three break points early in the third			1
they traded games evenly until the death , when he broke a frustrated opponent			0
by then there looked to be not enough light left for @entity2 to lose , but @entity9 knew winning the fourth could offer him the sanctuary of a night ’s rest — although it was the stiffening @entity2 who looked like he needed that more			2
full house : @entity2 scrambles to retrieve a forehand on court @entity171			0

the @entity175 no 1 beat @entity9 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 1 , 4 - 6 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 0 in the quarter - finals
@entity2 won the first two sets before @entity9 fought back to level the match
@entity2 dug deep to claim the final set in just 24 minutes
the 27 - year - old @entity22 will play @entity25 in the semi-finals on friday
