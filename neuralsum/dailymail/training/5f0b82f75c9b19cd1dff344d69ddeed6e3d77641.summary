the chip off the old @entity2 block made his father proud but did not do quite enough on his own behalf to win a fight which was an epic of its class			1
@entity8 boxed the boy ’s ears off in the first half of their grudge match and then survived a torrid last six rounds to hold onto this @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 middleweight titles			1
the excel arena was rocking even more loudly than when @entity20 was winning his super-heavyweight gold medal at the @entity22			0
but some of the closing rounds were a wafer thin call between the skills of @entity8 and the charging power of @entity54			1
@entity2 was given something of a boxing lesson in the first six rounds and if he had been given that kind of education before he probably would have caused the upset his famous father expected			1
as it , he finished this brutal night already the better for the experience and if these two collide again , which they surely will in the future , it could be a different ending			0
however , @entity8 proved his enormous courage in the closing stages to keep the more powerful @entity2 just about at bay			1
it was a magnificent clash of styles between the boxer and the powerful physical specimen			0
but @entity2 will be regretting not going onto the attack earlier			1
he spent the early rounds partly in posturing mode , trying to lure @entity8 onto a one - punch ko but the champion was so accurate with his southpaw jab that he was able to land and nip away on most occasions			1
and when @entity2 came storming after him he still landed sharp punches of his own in contrast to @entity2 ’s hefty blows			1
@entity2 's arrival was reminiscent of how his father used to come among us – adopting a statuesque pose on the ring apron before vaulting over the ropes			1
like @entity92 was in imposing , muscular condition , while his dad was his familiar immaculate self , in elegantly black to match the boy 's trunks			0
@entity2 stood waiting in the corner at the first bell and @entity100 obliged by crossing the ring to confront him , landing at once with his southpaw jab and continuing to do so through a lively first opening session in which he caught @entity2 with some crisp rights , also @entity8 was resisting the temptation to be drawn into a brawl to @entity2 's advantage			1
he used his more polished skills and again had the better of the more fiery exchanges			0
they taunted each other after one skirmish and then stood face to face at then of the round , which again went to @entity8			2
@entity8 shouts with delight after being named the winner of saturday evening 's grudge match in @entity38 @entity8 ( right ) has earned a shot at the @entity120 world middleweight title next year after his split decision victory @entity26 ( left ) , who came out on top on one judge 's scorecard , looks down on @entity8 after throwing a left hand @entity8 proudly displays his @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 title belts inside the ring after retaining them with another victory @entity2 was waiting to land the one big shot he needed to discourage @entity8 and reinforce his own confidence – while his father stood erect and watching intently behind his corner			1
he did connect with a sharp left when they landed simultaneously his punch looked the heavier			0
but @entity8 was unimpressed and went on to extend his early lead			2
@entity2 stood back in attempt to draw @entity8 in but the champion bided his time before engaging and his southpaw jab was usually accurate enough to enable him to connect and escape			1
@entity2 's lunges looked raw in comparison with the experienced skills of @entity8 and he had still to win a round			1
the fifth was a messier stanza so not as clear cut			0
with so few punches landed neither man deserved to win it			0
at times @entity151 was missing by yards			0
@entity8 tried to embarrass him into advancing by barking ' come on			2
' @entity2 made a gesture in that direction but too often ended up in a wrestling match			1
@entity8 just edges it but the rounds are inching closer			2
whenever referee @entity158 was able to keep them apart @entity8 landed			2
@entity160 had some success within the spasms of grappling and landed two good lefts to win his first round of what was becoming a very late night			0
@entity2 kept telling his opponent that he was not hurting him and there was no doubting his strength of chin as well as physique			2
the @entity173 cavalry charges ere beginning to have an effect and he shook @entity8 twice at close quarters to close the gap a little further			2
@entity26 ( left ) attempts to move out of the way of a powerful right hand from @entity8 during the early rounds of the fight @entity8 is lifted up onto the shoulders of one of his coaches in triumph after battling his way through 12 gruelling rounds @entity8 ( right ) uses his quick feet to escape from @entity26 's left hook in front of a capacity crowd at the @entity37 centre @entity2 ( centre ) congratulates @entity8 on his victory against his son by shaking his hand after the final bell it was rough house now but @entity8 rediscovered his range with some clever combinations			1
even though @entity2 shook his man with one pile - driver it was not enough to give him this one			2
@entity8 was boxing his way back into the ascendancy but still knew he was in a fight			1
@entity2 came on strong to land a heavy right but @entity8 opened up with lefts and right just before the bell to move within reaching distance of the finishing line			1
@entity212 was warned for punching low , not for the first time			0
as they clinched again and again the issue was whether @entity8 would weaken in the championship rounds			2
it was a war of attrition at this stage			0
@entity2 was warned yet again for punching low , then slipped to the canvas as it ended			0
on my card @entity2 needed a knockout			1
he went for it in massive style and rocked @entity8 twice			0
the effort was taking its toll on @entity2 , also			0
it was an epic climax , with @entity100 risking everything by standing his ground instead of keeping out of trouble , but he survived			0
both men claimed the victory , with @entity234 congratuling his son			0
he had won the last battle but surely not the war .			0
