by @entity1 reporter published : 07:28 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 16:33 est , 22 may 2013 a coroner has critised television programmes for trivialising the condition of compulsive hoarding after a pensioner died in a fire at her home which was filled floor to ceiling with rubbish			1
firefighters had to spend 30 minutes tunneling through stacks of rubbish in a desperate bid to rescue @entity18 , 65			1
her inquest heard that she might have survived the blaze had emergency services got to her sooner			0
' dangerous circumstances ' : the coroner said firefighters had to battle through a ' staggering ' amount of stuff to try to rescue @entity18 firefighter @entity28 said getting up the stairs to reach mrs @entity18 was like ' swimming in shale ' @entity31 and @entity33 coroner @entity32 said the stack of belongings was so deep the firefighters could also have died during the rescue			1
he hit out at the prime - time shows - such as @entity41 's ' @entity40 ' and ' @entity42 , and the @entity44 documentary ' my @entity45 ' - which have ' made light ' of the most extreme cases of compulsive hoarding for purposes of entertainment			1
he is calling for more to be done to highlight the dangers and consequences of hoarding			0
mr @entity32 added that the inquest strongly emphasised the risks that hoarders pose to themselves , and also others , including members of the fire service , who may be called to try and affect a rescue in the most difficult of circumstances			2
he said : ' hoarding has even reached the tv and it is almost made light of and obviously makes good tv			1
' ' however , this shows that people are at grave risk to themselves , potentially their neighbours , but equally to those who try to save lives			0
' the coroner strongly emphasised the risks that hoarders pose to themselves , and also others , by filling properties with possessions coroner @entity32 said the stack of belongings was so deep the firefighters could also have died during the rescue rescue bid : firefighters rushed to @entity84 , @entity85 , where they found the house of hoarder @entity18 full of rubbish criticism : coroner @entity32 said hoarding was made light of for the purposes of television entertainment when fire crews arrived at mrs @entity18 ’s home in @entity85 , @entity31 , on may 14 last year neighbours warned them they would struggle to get inside because of her hoarding			1
mr @entity32 said : ' the conditions were quite extreme on a number of levels			2
' ' the physical state of the property with the amount of stuff is quite staggering and made the job of the firefighters quite difficult and dangerous			2
' it would have been so easy to have two dead firefighters on the day			0
' therefore there should be significant praise for the firefighters for their determination in the face of extreme and dangerous circumstances to try and rescue @entity18			1
' it was so bad that her 37 - year - old son @entity116 , who lived with her , would spend two hours moving items each time he wanted to leave			1
grave risks : coroner @entity32 said the tragic case of @entity18 , 65 , who died in a house fire at her home in @entity85 , @entity31 , pictured , highlighted the dangers of hoarding having rescued mr @entity126 from an upstairs bathroom window , firefighters were unable to reach his mother , despite repeated attempts			1
when they finally got through the front door , they reported there was little space to carry out a search and the staircase was like a tunnel due to all the belongings			2
the blaze was caused by an electrical fault after an extension cable running under the clutter was rubbed down to the bare wire by people walking past the items			2
it was one of the hottest blazes fire crews reported having ever faced			0
firefighter @entity28 said getting up the stairs to reach mrs @entity18 was like ' swimming in shale '			1
he had to use his hands to provide his colleague @entity150 with a platform to reach the first floor			0
crew manager @entity153 said : ' we smashed a back window and the stuff in the house was about a foot from the top of the room			0
it was impossible to get in			0
' i had hold of her arm when i was up the ladder but i could n’t reach her enough to pull her out			0
i did fear for my own safety			0
the smoke was so thick and black			0
' criticism : coroner @entity32 said hoarding was made light of for the purposes of television entertainment			1
( file photo ) mrs @entity18 died at the scene from smoke inhalation			1
she had been in discussions with social housing provider livin , which managed the house , weeks before the incident over her hoarding problem			0
mr @entity32 plans to write to social housing providers about hoarding in the hope it will reduce the risk to both individuals and the emergency services			2
recording a verdict of accidental death , mr @entity32 also called into question the radios used by firefighters after a malfunction believed to have been caused when climbing the stairs left them unable to confirm any change of plan with the rescue			2
he said although it did not contribute to mrs @entity18 ’s death , he would be writing to the fire brigade to see if new measures could be put in place			1
@entity210 , livin ’s executive director for people and communities , said : ' as the tenant was clearly overwhelmed by the amount of items that had accumulated in her home , livin ’s community co-ordinator was working closely with the family and making good progress in supporting them to clear the vast amount of items being hoarded			0
' we have also run articles in our tenants magazine and on our website to highlight the dangers of hoarding			0
