keeping up with fashion can take its toll – as @entity2 knows only too well			1
hoping to emulate her style icons as a teenager , miss @entity2 plucked her eyebrows to achieve a thin arch. now aged 30 , she has spent £ 3,500 on an eyebrow transplant operation , after the over-zealous tweezing permanently damaged her hair follicles , resulting in brows that would n’t grow back properly			1
delighted : @entity10 , @entity2 is pleased with the effect of her eyebrow transplant after years of plucking left her with almost no eyebrows at all right : @entity2 overplucked for years			1
' it was the fashion , ' she says now miss @entity2 , a dental technician , said : ' i did n’t understand the harm i was doing to my eyebrows in my teens and i was horrified when i finally learnt the truth in my twenties			1
' it badly affected my confidence			0
i did n’t like people seeing me without make - up			0
i would be reluctant to open the door if i had n’t used my eyebrow pencil			0
' just as men have their thinning hair boosted with follicles taken from the backs of their heads , women can have their eyebrows thickened using the same technique			2
the @entity38 has reported a surge in demand for the treatment , boosted , they say , by the current trend for bold eyebrows like those of the @entity45 , currently the most high - profile member of the big brow brigade			1
@entity2 's eyebrows were transformed during a six - hour operation at the @entity49 in @entity50			1
in the pictures of @entity2 taken before the procedure , her eyebrows , which were no more than a thin line of hair , are barely noticeable			1
the practitioner drew an outline to indicate where he would extend @entity2 's brows the ' after ' pictures - taken months after the operation when the new brows had fully grown in - show the brows restored closer to how they looked before over-plucking occurred			1
@entity2 , 30 , said she was thrilled with the results			1
she said : ' this is big problem for thousand and thousands of women - especially for those around my age			0
' it was very fashionable when i was a teenager to pluck your eyebrows - everyone was at it			0
' i wanted to look like the celebrities at that time and , to have that look , you had to pluck your eyebrows			0
' i carried on doing it over may years at home with tweezers and ended up permanently damaging my brows			2
' a hair follicle only has a finite number of cycles of growth and if you pluck it too many times , you end up killing it off			2
' that is what happened with me			0
' i realised i had brought this on myself and i was a little embarrassed to seek treatment			0
i thought the only people who had eyebrow transplants were people who suffered from alopecia			0
' restored : the brows are now full and defined - but because the follicles are taken from @entity2 's head , she must trim them more regularly - cutting them every two weeks @entity2 , from @entity50 , eventually consulted the hair transplant surgeon @entity104 at the @entity49 just outside the city			1
he carried out a transplant by removing a narrow strip of hair from the back of @entity2 's head , taking care to chose hair that most closely matched the colour and texture of her eyebrows			1
the strip , which is around an inch long , contained 400 to 500 hairs , and each was painstakingly separated out under a microscope			0
inspiration : baaps say that the @entity122 of @entity124 's statement eyebrows have led to women who had over-plucked their brows seeking to restore them the individual hairs , still attached to their roots , were transplanted by dr @entity104 into small holes made in @entity2 's eyebrows using a fine needle and under local anaesthetic			1
the one difference with her old brows is that new hair grows more quickly and needs to be trimmed every two weeks or so			1
@entity2 , who works at @entity137 clinic in @entity138 , @entity139 , said : ' i am so pleased with the results			2
' it has boosted my confidence and made me feel so much more comfortable about my appearance			0
it is the best thing i have ever done			0
' she said any women should seek expert help if they wanted to pluck their eyebrows			0
' do n't do it yourself , is my advice , ' @entity2 warned			2
' you could end up doing permanent damage			0
' dr @entity104 said that the @entity45 had sparked interest in the procedure			2
he said : ' statement eyebrows are the new beauty must - have , but sadly many women have permanently damaged their eyebrows through over-plucking			0
' for many women who crave fuller brows like the @entity45 or stars such as @entity164 , the only solution is an eyebrow transplant			1
' we have seen a big increase in interest in the procedure and many women , like @entity2 , have been delighted with the results			2
