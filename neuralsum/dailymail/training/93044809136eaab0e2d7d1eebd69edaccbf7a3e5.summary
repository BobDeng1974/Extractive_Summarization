on the pitch , @entity0 watches @entity2 take his @entity4 tally to eight with a clinical double to sink sorry @entity6			1

‘ my imagination works like yours , ’ said @entity0 when pressed on the prospect of @entity7 joining forces with the @entity14 forward			2
@entity2 wheels away after scoring his second in @entity4 's 2 - 0 win at @entity6 a terrible back pass by @entity21 allowed @entity2 to steal the ball and open the scoring @entity2 nips in to seal his brace after an even worse defensive error from @entity6 keeper @entity26 @entity2 's heat map shows how he dominated the centre of @entity4 's attack against the @entity6 @entity0 was not impressed with the decision to show a yellow card to @entity32 for diving			1
the @entity4 and @entity8 forward was cautioned when @entity35 ruled that he toppled too easily under a challenge from @entity37			2
replays , however , support @entity0 ’s claim that the booking was unjust			0
earlier , @entity40 was also judged to have dived – although he was n’t booked – when @entity21 ’s clumsy tackle sent him crashing to the ground			2
and , when asked if his players had been the victim of the recent debate on diving , @entity0 said ‘ you should ask the referee ( that ) , but i did n’t see a dive ( with @entity32 ) , it was very harsh			0
and i think in the first half when @entity44 went through there was a foul as well			0
’ ‘ @entity7 ’s runs off the ball are fantastic and he gives you hope that we will score			0
’ in the meantime , @entity2 has kept @entity4 , in fifth , clinging to the early - season pace - setters			1
the £ 30million signing from @entity59 punished a calamitous @entity6			0
first he seized upon @entity21 ’s horribly undercooked back - pass before drawing goalkeeper @entity26 to him with the ease of a snake charmer and dinking delightfully beyond him			0
then , when @entity26 panicked under pressure from @entity2 late on , the @entity4 man stole in to win the ball and prod it home			1
@entity40 has certainly been impressed by his new comrade , likening him to @entity67 , the player who , ironically , replaced @entity2 at the @entity68			1
‘ he ’s a world - class player — everyone saw that at the @entity72 , ’ said the 21 - year - old			0
‘ he reminds me of @entity67 when he chases everything down and he makes nothing into something			0
he ’s done that for us twice and he ’s scored goals at important times for us			1
’ @entity7 ( @entity80 ) chats with @entity81 after returning from a long spell out with a knee ligament injury deleilah the @entity6 mascot welcomes @entity7 back at the @entity84 @entity0 ( @entity80 ) is looking forward to playing @entity7 and @entity2 together for the first time @entity6 have only won one of their last 22 league games against @entity4			1
@entity4 ’s victory was just their third in the league this season but arrived on the back of their come - from - behind triumph at @entity93			1
injuries have blighted their progress — @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are long - term absentees — but @entity100 insists their season remains very much intact			2
@entity40 has likened @entity2 to former @entity103 striker @entity67 @entity100 insists that @entity4 are on the road to recovery after a struggling start ‘ it has been tough for us , ’ he said			1
‘ but if you look where we are , in the top six and hopefully on course for the next stage of the @entity114 , then it has not been a bad start this season			0
‘ the spirit in the team this year is great			0
’ @entity2 , it seems , has made all the difference			0
@entity121 says it is ‘ impossible ’ for @entity6 to win matches if they continue to gift goals to the opposition			2
the @entity6 were guilty of a string of defensive howlers as they were beaten 8 - 0 at @entity128 last weekend			1
but mistakes from @entity21 and goalkeeper @entity26 allowed @entity2 to score twice on saturday , and @entity121 warned : ‘ we can not make any more			2
