by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 21:01 est , 31 october 2013 when a 19th century village railway closed in 1965 , time stood still			2
station master @entity3 could n’t bear to leave , so he and his wife preserved all the original features and turned it into a museum			1
they raised their four children in the station master ’s house and lived there until they died			1
the @entity30 ’ daughter , @entity29 , 47 , said her father was loath to leave so he rented it for five years after it closed , before buying it for £ 800 in 1970			1
the family kept their free - to - enter museum open till 2010			0
mrs @entity29 said : ‘ my dad loved the romance of the railway and my mum ’s dad was a steam train driver , so the railway was in our blood			0
‘ we ’d love a railway enthusiast to buy the station and keep it just as it is			2
’ built in 1851 , the station still has its original signal box , ticket office , waiting room and platform and its buildings are full of railway memorabilia – right down to the enamelled advertising hoardings for @entity59 cigarettes and the platform ’s @entity61 gas lamps			1
it served its community for decades , taking deliveries of milk churns and food on the platform and allowing villagers to travel the length of the small branch line , but was abandoned by @entity72 when dr @entity74 's axe fell in 1965 , leaving it to the care of its station master who purchased it for just £ 800			1
mr @entity3 , who also acted as signalman , bought the station and all its buildings - including the engine shed and goods warehouse - and chose not to change a thing			1
@entity87 , of @entity88 , who is handling the sale of the station and its three acres of land , said : ' in parts @entity92 appears to still be a working station , so much has been preserved			2
' it is a testimony to the quality of the original building , as well as the love and care of @entity3 and mrs short , who bought the station when it closed , and restored it			1
' tracks : the platforms on either side of the station still remain with the benches and lights in tact tracks : the station stood on a 23 - mile stretch of track which served the border town of @entity115 and the a number of communities in rural @entity27 the original signal box still remains on the site , but has not been used for around 60 years controls : the signal box still contains the old levers which would transfer locomotives across the tracks and guide them into the small station waiting : this photo from the station 's early years shows men , women and children ready to board an approaching train single or return ? owners could use the @entity135 office where nothing has moved since its closure , every detail from tickets , lost property forms and the @entity135 's glass still remain untouched : a ticket which has been left on the desk since 1965 shows a journey from @entity145 in @entity146 and a pair of glasses and a pipe used by the ticket inspector office : papers lay strewn around the old station master 's desk while a jacket remains hanging in the window attachment : the last station master , @entity3 , did not want to his old workplace go to waste , so bought the site in 1970 for just £ 800 , he has since passed away authority : the station master would have gone through his daily routine wearing this hat , which has become slightly frayed since the station 's closure @entity170 , a partner at the firm , added : ' this is a unique and rare opportunity to purchase a perfectly preserved railway station			1
' stations do come up for sale from time to time , but never with as much property or land attached , nor as well preserved			0
' not only is this a home , it is also a piece of history , and it is unlikely there is another station similar in the whole country			2
' @entity13 was built in 1851 and stands on the @entity186 that ran from @entity187 in @entity188 , across the border to @entity190 , @entity191 , in @entity192			1
brought about by the @entity194 of 1845 , the 23 - mile track served the border town of @entity115 and the rural communities all along the route			0
its one claim to fame arrived in 1948 when the @entity201 was flooded and for three months , through the autumn , express trains were diverted along the branch , including @entity205			0
the shorts , who showed visitors around the free - to - enter museum they ran until its closure in 2010 , described it as ' a lovely , happy little station ' where milk churns arrived each morning , goods were delivered for local shops and parcels for the villagers			2
hut : a shovel lies against the wall of the porter 's cabin , which has not been used in almost 50 years delivery : @entity224 receipts detailing where parcels and post would be send remain stamped and in their pigeon holes controversial : @entity74 holding one of the reports which would lead to the closure of thousands of railway stations across the country in the 1960s when @entity235 railways reached their peak at the end of the @entity238 , they faced increasing competition from the road networks and car manufacturers who were selling more affordable vehicles			2
therefore dr @entity74 was brought in to restructure the rail network in order to save money			0
the two reports , published in 1963 and 1965 , identified 2,363 stations — one - third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed			0
the publications set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation ’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic , while one - third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic			0
two - thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round			0
one extreme example of this under - use highlighted by @entity74 was in @entity263 , where the line between @entity265 and @entity266 carried an average of only nine passengers on five trains a day			0
not surprisingly , his proposal sparked outrage from commuters , local councils and the trade unions , who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses			0
@entity278 : the discarded tickets was from a passenger who took a journey from @entity282 to @entity13 toys : a large model railway was built inside the booking office to make the property perfect for any train enthusiast decor : milk churns , a trailer and a collection of posters from the 1960 's adorn the outside of the station building which leads out onto the platform danger : a sign next to the station warns passengers against going on the track , but the fine is relatively cheap by today 's standards family : @entity305 ( left ) and @entity304 , daughter 's of the station 's final station master @entity306 , said they had fond memories of the station growing up exterior : the shorts , standing outside the front of the house , said they would prefer a rail enthusiast to buy the site to keep it as it is history : this family photo of the shorts show how it has been a part of their family for decades profit : following the death of their father in 2008 , they are looking to sell the station for £ 420,000 , which was bought for £ 800 in 1970			1

@entity13 in @entity27 comes complete with its original signal box , waiting room and platform
was purchased by the final station master @entity3 after its demise 48 years *ago* and could sell for £ 420,000
