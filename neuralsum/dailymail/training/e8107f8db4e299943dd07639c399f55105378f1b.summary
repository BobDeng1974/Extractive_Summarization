by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:13 est , 7 february 2014 from @entity3 to @entity4 , the list of artists who have made it their business to offer a unique perspective on war is a long and distinguished one			2
but there 's one painter who has never had the recognition she deserves and , apart from her name , practically nothing is known about her			0
@entity17 , a member of the @entity18 during @entity19 , spent her brief career documenting the work of her colleagues in a series of beautifully drawn sketches			1
haunting : @entity27 's work , @entity25 shows @entity18 on duty reading a book , circa 1943 - 44 after the war , the images were given to the @entity32 , and will go on display for the first time in 60 years in an exhibition that launches next week			1
but despite her obvious talent , ms @entity17 remains a mystery - one that the museum hopes to solve with the help of visitors			1
' she wrote to the @entity41 from @entity42 in 1947 , when she offered her drawings , but she gave no indication of what she was doing at the time , and after that we heard no more , ' explains dr @entity48 , the museum 's curator of art. so what do we know about the @entity53 's most enigmatic war artist			1
first that like most wrns , she was childless and unmarried when she signed up			0
records show that she trained on @entity55 with the ' @entity57 class ' of january to july 1943 and that she served at shore base @entity58 as a telegraph operator			1
women at war : @entity18 working as telegraph operators at @entity58 in @entity64 circa 1944 it is also known that it was while she serving in @entity64 that the 14 works held by the @entity32 , their subjects ranging from telephonists to security details , were completed			1
' the remarkable quality of her drawings suggests that she had an artistic training , ' adds dr @entity75			0
' they are a rare eyewitness account of life in the @entity18 during the @entity19			1
there were depictions of women ’s wartime work , but these were usually commissioned by the government			0
' @entity85 ’s drawings are unusual because she was a @entity18 and shared the experiences of the women she depicted			1
' as such , her sketches have a different feel to them , quite unlike the works done by official war artists , which would have been more staged , and used for propaganda			2
jobs for the girls : @entity18 ' dhobeying ' ( doing laundry ) and stripping and cleaning parts from depth charges delicate job : a @entity18 torpedo woman repairing the sound power phones on board of one of @entity107 trawlers , c. 1944 ' @entity108 did the drawings for herself and her fellow workers , in the hope , she said , that " they may reflect a little of that busy , happy atmosphere that did exist in the @entity18 "			1
they are more personal , and as such they feel very real and touching too			0
' after the war , in may 1947 , @entity108 , by then living on @entity118 in @entity42 , began a correspondence with the @entity120 and the @entity41 , with a view to presenting her wartime drawings			0
in her letters to the @entity41 ’s director , @entity126 , she wrote that ' while serving in the @entity18 during the war as a @entity129 operator , [ she ] attempted to keep , in [ her ] off - watch time , a sketch record of some of the various interesting kinds of work being done by @entity18 '			2
war effort : a @entity18 torpedo woman servicing torpedo tubes , by @entity27 , circa 1944 for his part , @entity126 adored the ' delightful drawings ' which ' we feel that these form a most useful : and , if i may say so , a most graceful record of the @entity18 work in the war , so much more telling than photographs			1
he added : ' we are trying to build a really good record for future generations : and i am sure that your sketches would interest and give pleasure to many in the years ahead			0
' 14 sketches duly arrived but more letters from @entity17 did not			2
she simply disappeared , leaving only her drawings behind			0
' we 're in touch with the @entity157 to see if someone knows or remembers her , ' adds dr @entity75			0
' i would love to hear from anyone who might have clues as to what happened to her			0
' the work of @entity17 will appear in @entity164 , from 15th february at @entity165 , @entity166			2

@entity27 served at shore base @entity58 between 1943 and 1945
she made several pencil sketches of her fellow @entity18 during the period
donated 14 works to the @entity32 in @entity166 in 1947
after 1947 , she disappeared without trace and nothing is known of her life
museum is appealing for *information* and clues in hopes of finding her
