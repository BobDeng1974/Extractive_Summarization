@entity0 is set to be handed the chance to play as @entity4 ’s new midfield anchor next season			1
manager @entity5 believes the 22 - year - old has the football brain to play as his side ’s holding central midfielder — a move that could save the club millions in the transfer market			1
the club had identified a new defensive midfielder as one of their transfer priorities , with the @entity17 looking at moves for @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity0 was part of the @entity4 squad that flew to @entity34 on wednesday ahead of saturday ’s clash against @entity36			2
the squad arrived in the early hours on thursday morning			0
and @entity5 could use the clash to examine the @entity39 international in the position			0
in addition to @entity0 , the @entity4 manager also has @entity43 and @entity44 who can play the role , while @entity46 is also fit again			1
the news will come as a boost to @entity0 , who has not had the most memorable few months			0
tradition : @entity0 poses for a selfie on the plane with @entity4 goalkeeper @entity52 all aboard : @entity0 boards the flight with a copy of the @entity56 , and he is joined by @entity43 a foot injury sustained while playing for @entity39 wrecked the final few weeks of last season , while he was forced to play a peripheral role during the @entity60			1
he was under the spotlight again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in @entity63			2
major question marks have been raised over @entity0 ’s long - term role in @entity5 ’s plans given the manager ’s extensive midfield options			1
with @entity69 established as the club ’s premier central midfielder , @entity0 ’s place in @entity4 ’s engine room looks far from guaranteed with @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity74 and @entity75 all vying for a place alongside the @entity77			1
targets : @entity79 pair @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) are thought to be on @entity5 's hit list faith : but @entity5 may leave all his targets , including @entity21 ( above ) , and opt for @entity0 sitting pretty : @entity0 takes a break from training at @entity85 on @entity86 but a transition to a deeper - lying midfield role could help @entity89 maintain a regular spot in @entity5 ’s starting @entity92 next season , as well as strengthen his @entity39 chances			1
meanwhile , @entity94 believe they can persuade @entity4 to part with @entity95 this summer			0
the @entity96 international is a long - term target of @entity99 and the @entity100 hopes this could be the year he lands the attacker			0
@entity95 has been an integral member of @entity5 ’s plans since his arrival from @entity105 two years ago			0
but competition for attacking midfield positions is fierce at @entity4 , particularly after the £ 30million arrival of @entity109			2
heavy lifting : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity95 ( right ) take part in training before the side jetted off to the @entity34 @entity4 kicked off their pre-season schedule with a 2 - 0 win at @entity116 on sunday before saturday sees them start their @entity34 tour with a match against @entity17 legend @entity119 's @entity36			1
in addition to the @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 will all compete to play in positions behind the central striker next season			0
and @entity94 , who are also interested in @entity129 , are hopeful that @entity5 can be persuaded to part with @entity95 , despite the fact he only signed a 12 month contract extension earlier this year			0
@entity4 have handed a trial to @entity134 midfielder @entity133 , 17			2
@entity135 youngster @entity133 can play in various positions in defence as well and is likely to train with the first team			0
@entity140 trophy not enough - @entity43			0

@entity5 could hand @entity0 the holding central midfielder role at @entity4
this despite @entity0 being in the spotlight for smoking last week
@entity5 had targeted @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21
but if deals do not develop , @entity5 and his stagg believe @entity0 could be the man to boss @entity4 's midfield this season
