by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 13 june 2012 the number of @entity2 working after they start collecting their pensions has doubled in nearly 20 years because growing numbers simply can not afford to retire			1
a new study has found that 1.4 million pensioners , 12 per cent of the total elderly population , are earning extra money compared to 753,000 in 1993			1
and it is women who need to earn for longer , with 61 per cent of all these older workers found to be female			2
the @entity12 say in total more than a third of the 1.4 million are forced to work full time , as the cost of housing and bills like gas and electricity go through the roof			2
hard up : the number of working pensioners has doubled in 20 years and 61 per cent of them are women they also say the pensioner population has not grown enough since 1993 to explain the rise			1
it also appears more older people in @entity30 and the @entity32 work than elsewhere , with around 14 per cent in those areas having to get paid employment to support their pensions			1
in the north east of @entity39 and @entity40 fewer have to work , around 8 per cent , the figures show			1
' the number of people working beyond state pension age has almost doubled , ' the @entity12 said today , adding : ' the number of these workers has risen at a faster rate than the population			0
' there may be many factors influencing the decision for more people to work past retirement such as financial pressures , people living longer and wanting to remain active in society and others			0
' those remaining in the labour market work fewer hours , possibly helped by the financial support of their state pension and other pension arrangements , which allows them to fit their work around other engagements , ' the @entity12 said			0
the research found 32 % of the working pensioners were self - employed , double the amount of under - 60s			2
while two out of three employed directly had been working for a business for ten years or more and just carried on after their retirement was due			0
around two - thirds of the men worked in jobs classed as higher skilled , such as property managers , marketing and sales directors , production managers and chief executives , but almost two - thirds of women worked in lower skilled jobs			0
of all the work carried out by men , the two most common were farmers and taxi drivers , while for women the most common job was cleaning , followed by administration assistants , care workers and retail assistants .			0

1.45 million pensioners work now compared to 753,000 in 1993
now one in ten can not afford to retire fully
61 per cent of these are women
@entity30 and the south - east have the highest *concentration* , north - east @entity39 the lowest
