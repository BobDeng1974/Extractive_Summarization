by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor banks must be stopped from pouring ‘ petrol on the fire ’ of @entity7 ’s booming housing market , @entity2 warned today			2
the business secretary stepped up his warnings about the risk posed to the economy by a new property bubble , risking renewed tensions with @entity14 who has played down the threat			1
the @entity17 yesterday said global action was needed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crash			1
business secretary @entity2 said he had been ' alarmed ' at the size of loans some banks were willing to offer mr @entity14 is expected to tackle the issue of house prices in his annual @entity27 speech later			1
the chancellor is due to back plans to free up more brownfield land for housing , insisting building more homes is the only way to tackle soaring prices			1
but mr @entity2 has pre-empted the speech , with a series of extraordinary warnings about the dangers of access to cheap loans			2
he appeared to suggest ministers could interfere in the @entity43 ’s independence by demanding action to cool the market			2
the business secretary said he had been ' appalled ' to discover the size of loans being agreed by some lenders and urged the @entity43 to use its powers to intervene			1
asked whether there should be a strict cap , the @entity50 cabinet minister told @entity53 ’s today : ' it is crucially important that the banks do n’t throw petrol on the fire			0
chancellor @entity14 is expected to use his @entity27 speech to address concerns about the housing market ' most of us who have been through various housing booms in the past have recognised that a kind of stable level is three or three - and - a - half times ' i was appalled when i discovered that banks were lending five times			1
' they have already reined it back on advice from the @entity43 but this is the key area that the @entity43 has got to operate in to make sure that this boom in house prices , particularly in the south of @entity43 , does n’t destabilise the whole of the economy			1
' the @entity43 gives guidance , hopefully steering the banks into making sure that the money goes into supporting small and medium - sized companies and getting long - term growth going rather than in fuelling house prices			2
' that is the role of the @entity43			0
they now do it in subtle ways but it is clearly their responsibility			0
' some banks have already moved to restrict lending - with @entity94 and @entity95 declining mortgages of more than £ 500,000 where that is more than four times earnings			0
mr @entity2 accepted that tighter restrictions would mean many in @entity100 could not afford to buy but said the interests of the country as a whole had to be addressed			0
' the desires of individuals have to be balanced against the stability of the economy as a whole , ' he said			0
' i do n’t want anyone to suffer but we have to make sure that the boom that is currently taking place in prices does not get out of control			2
' it follows a warning from the @entity17 that rising house prices around the world could threaten a new crash			1
@entity121 , deputy managing director of the @entity17 , said : ' housing booms have different characteristics across countries and time periods			1
' what is common is that when the bust comes , it very often damages financial stability and the real economy			0
' the tools for containing housing booms are still being developed			0
the evidence on their effectiveness is only just starting to accumulate			0
the interactions of various policy tools can be complex			0
