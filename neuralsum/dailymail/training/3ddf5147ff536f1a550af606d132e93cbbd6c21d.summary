@entity0 were taken apart by @entity1 at the @entity2 with @entity3 and @entity5 spectators as @entity7 ’s side ran riot in a 4 - 0 victory			1
it is the first time in 64 years that @entity0 have lost three straight games in the ground of their neighbours but this was different – this was embarrassing for the richest club in football , smothered from the first kick to last by their poor - relations city neighbours			0
@entity0 's £ 250m forward line of @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity21 mustered just one shot in a first half dominated by @entity1 who scored twice through @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity25 celebrates giving his side the lead against rivals @entity0 on saturday afternoon the former @entity31 midfielder watches as his effort beats @entity0 captain @entity33 @entity26 doubles @entity1 's lead with a superb overhead kick just four minuted after the first goal @entity26 celebrates scoring the second goal while his team - mates rush over to join him @entity40 winger @entity39 celebrates scoring his side 's third goal mid way through the second half @entity46 's diving header in the 89th minute sealed a monumental win for @entity1 @entity46 celebrates after scoring the fourth , which was assisted by @entity49 @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity50 ; @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 ; @entity25 , @entity55 ( @entity26 10 [ @entity56 71 ] ) , @entity57 , @entity58 ; @entity39 ( @entity49 77 ) , @entity46			1

booked : @entity72 , @entity71			0
and in the second half the suffering continued when the brilliant @entity39 added a third and @entity46 made it four			1
a shell - shocked @entity86 said after the game			2
‘ they deserved to win because they won in every facet : they won the battle and they won the football match			0
we will have to change our attitude going forward			0
‘ we were second to everything ; we lost all the aerial challenges , we were n’t in the game			2
none of our players played well			0
it ’s the worst performance since i have been the manager			0
’ @entity102 said : ‘ the way the players carried out the plan was brilliant			1
we went about the job very seriously and now we need to keep going forward the same way			0
’ asked if they were now title candidates he said : ‘ we still take it one get at a time			0
’ and when it was put to him that it was one of his greatest games in charge of @entity117 he said : ‘ no , it was just another a league game ’			0
@entity1 shot out of the blocks			1
in contrast @entity0 were strolling and it was n’t long before they were paying the price for that lack of intensity			0
@entity57 ’s corner on 13 minutes was brought down by @entity46 who laid it back to @entity25 on the edge of the area			1
the former @entity31 midfielder shot through a crowded penalty area and @entity33 fumbled the effort and allowed it to squirm over the line			1
‘ @entity134 ’ sung the @entity1 supporters			1
they had been given a helping hand by @entity0 ’s keeper , not that they needed it			0
@entity0 were playing without three of their first - choice back four and it was showing with @entity66 struggling to deal with @entity58 and @entity67 and @entity68 not able to handle @entity46			1
perhaps their preoccupation with the @entity141 striker was the reason why they left @entity26 in so much space in the penalty area on 19 minutes			1
the young midfielder who was out on loan at @entity147 last season and interesting a host of @entity151 clubs had only been on the pitch for nine minutes replacing the injured @entity55			0
@entity54 got away from @entity69 , dribbled along the byline and pulled the ball back where @entity26 finished with an acrobatic scissor kick past a this - time faultless @entity33			2
@entity69 had received no support from @entity5 who had more importantly been anonymous in attack down the @entity1 right			2
likewise @entity3 was missing in action down the left			2
by half time @entity86 had seen enough and put @entity3 at centre forward bringing , on @entity71 at the expense of @entity70 but it made no real difference			1
real were fortunate to only be two goals down at half - time			0
@entity39 had scored what would have been a third only to be incorrectly flagged offside			1
and a @entity53 shot had hit @entity70 on the face and then the hand leaving @entity1 players demanding a penalty			2
@entity3 looks dejected after @entity0 concede two goals inside the opening 20 minutes of the game @entity1 manager @entity102 celebrates after his side score during the derby former @entity180 midfielder @entity72 controls the ball while his old team - mate @entity46 closes him down @entity5 crosses the ball while @entity1 defender @entity183 closes him down three - time @entity184 winner @entity3 looks annoyed after being fouled during the first half @entity1 's @entity186 midfielder @entity58 tussles for the ball with @entity189 full back @entity66 @entity0 manager @entity86 issues instructions to his players during the second half @entity0 had managed just one shot in the first half and it was notable that no @entity0 player said anything to a team - mate walking off the pitch – each one leaving the pitch with his head down			1
perhaps they were saving it for the dressing room			0
real improved at the start of the second half and with @entity56 booked for dissent while warming up on the touchline and @entity58 also cautioned there was hope for @entity0 , but it was false hope			0
@entity39 continued to threaten after the break			1
@entity211 palmed away his shot , he then bicycle - kicked just over from @entity26 ’s cross , and then headed @entity51 ’s cross over			2
he was also involved in the build up to what should have been a brilliant third			0
real were left dizzy from @entity1 ’s passing football down the right and when @entity51 crossed , @entity25 sent his free - header into the arms of @entity33			1
the third did come however and no one deserved it more than @entity39			2
this was now embarrassing for @entity0			0
they have been out - fought by @entity102 's team before , but never out - played like this			1
the last time @entity1 had beaten real 3 - 0 at home in the league it was 1970			2
@entity228 on @entity75 for @entity21 but everyone connected with @entity0 just wanted the final whistle			0
@entity1 did n’t want it to end			2
@entity102 was conducting the crowd and @entity49 was on for the brilliant @entity39 and looking for a goal of his own			1
@entity0 forced their first corner and @entity74 shot just over but @entity0 were still sinking and the @entity2 , who had greeted the two teams with a sea of red and white flags at the start , were now doing the ‘ @entity240 ’ as the clock ran down			0
@entity49 never got his goal but he did set up @entity46 to convert the fourth and complete the humiliating rout			1
once again @entity102 had masterminded an extraordinary victory			2
@entity3 said : ‘ it ’s a terrible day for us			2
we are very annoyed because everything was missing – desire , attitude			0
@entity0 ca n’t lose 4 - 0 against any team in the world			0
but i am still convinced we will win the league			0
