a stray bison which charmed a village of @entity2 has been shot dead by local farmers who feared the animal was seducing all of their cows			1
the animal , nicknamed @entity7 , first appeared in @entity8 in autumn and quickly became a staple of village life			1
but after spending time grazing with cattle herds , the bison attracted the attention of the village 's cows			1
@entity7 ( pictured ) was shot dead by farmers who feared the rare animal was seducing all their cows after growing accustomed to life in the village of @entity8 in northern @entity2 , the animal became acquainted with the local cattle herds to the horror of local farmers , the livestock stopped returning to their barns to be milked at night instead staying in the field with @entity28			1
after calling a village meeting , the farmers agreed the animal should be killed despite protests from other residents			1
they hired two hunters to shoot @entity28 dead before carting him off in a truck			1
the town 's mayor , @entity35 , said the animal was causing no harm to the majority of the village			2
' despite his great size he was very gentle and was even given the name @entity28			2
we have no idea where he came from or how he got there , but he did n’t do any harm			0
' he interested the locals and so he was fed and nobody bothered him			0
as a result although he was nervous at the start he began to spend more time in the local pastures than in the forest			0
the animals stopped returning to their barns at night to be milked , instead staying out to graze with @entity28 local farmers hired two hunters to kill the animal , to the dismay of some villagers who had grown to love him mayor @entity35 ( pictured ) said @entity60 was gentle and did not harm anyone in the village ' at night the cows would stay with him rather than in their barn			1
i guess he was building himself a family and a herd of his own which is perfectly natural			0
' but that did n’t impress the owners of the cows who were used to them coming home in the evening to be milked			2
all of a sudden they were staying out with the bison instead			0
' millions of bison are thought to have roamed @entity76 at one time , with slightly smaller versions of the animal found in @entity79			0
the last wild @entity81 bison is thought to have been killed in 1929 , with the only remaining members of the species protected in zoos or conservation efforts			0
a small number were released into the wild in the 1950 's , with herds roaming across @entity81 countries today .			0
