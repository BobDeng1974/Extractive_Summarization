on sunday night , at the @entity1 , it ’s the @entity2 against the @entity3			1
the @entity2 against the @entity4			0
@entity5 vs @entity6 — the hard - nosed , port - city , blue - collar roustabouts against the rich , privileged , capital - city - slickers			1
or at least , that ’s the way many want it portrayed			2
the way many in @entity5 have always viewed it — and always will			1
the home side are @entity16 top scorers , two points behind the visitors who are leaders and have won seven of @entity23 ’s last eight @entity22 matches			1
@entity6 forward @entity24 controls the ball during their training session @entity6 defender @entity28 , formerly of @entity29 , pictured ahead of their clash with @entity33 rivals @entity5 @entity34 runs during training as @entity6 prepare to meet @entity36 on sunday night in @entity16 the fixture between blue - collar @entity5 and money - bags @entity6 guarantees ferocity on sunday night even if the title were not so finely balanced , this fixture guarantees ferocity			1
culturally , socially and historically , there is deep enmity			0
but it is also a contest which pitches @entity5 ’s ultra-eccentric , ‘ is he a fraud / is he a genius ? ’ coach , @entity50 , right where he wants to be			1
bear with me , we ’ll return to that thought			0
so obsessive has @entity50 been about football for so long that it has devoured him			1
the man who took 7,000 videos of matches , goals , players , free - kicks , corners and penalties with him to @entity66 as coach of @entity68 at the 2002 @entity69 ( his team were knocked out in the first round ) has reached a stage whereby no matter how well he instructs , no matter how much sagacity there is in that strange old head of his bursting to get out , the damage inflicted by his relentless intensity makes the experience pyrrhic			0
however , in fairness , pyrrhic does mean victory — just at too great a cost			0
@entity84 , there has thus far been some success for the man who appointed him — @entity5 president @entity87			1
initially , he reckoned : ‘ getting @entity50 , the perfect man for our project , was a huge stroke of luck			1
‘ i still sometimes ask myself how on earth we managed to get a coach like @entity50			1
it ’s a bit like signing @entity97 for 12 months … ’ the sentiment lasted until the @entity99 savaged @entity87 for his work in the late summer transfer market			2
with some justification , it must be said			0
@entity5 manager @entity50 pictured during a press conference on friday ahead of the tie @entity5 have not had this many points in @entity16 at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 the two men thrashed out a truce , which has held , in public at least , and that has yielded more of the ‘ @entity117 ’ glow which can envelop the early stages of a @entity50 infestation			1
@entity5 have not had this many points at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 — only their second major trophy since 1992			1
in terms of firepower and value for money , they have scored 21 and 26 goals more than the last two seasons respectively			0
at the volatile , passionate , but success - starved @entity1 , the fans sing songs about @entity68 and chant @entity50 ’s name			1
in a blue - collar city where nobody says ‘ please ' , ' thank you ’ or ‘ after you ’ , the paying punter loves to hear stories of the players sweating , hard , for their salaries			2
yet the usual problems prevail			0
@entity50 ’s deal is for two years , but a ‘ break ’ clause is available to either side in june			1
he wo n’t even hint whether he ’s going or staying			2
there are leaks that some players are exhausted			0
@entity50 ’s bible says , literally : ‘ running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything ’			1
at @entity153 , i know for a fact players still think he made them run through minor injuries , damaging their performances			0
@entity159 , if you got him to tell you the truth , left for @entity160 , in part , to get away from the guy			0
@entity50 ’s is the @entity164 method			1
@entity50 pictured during the 2002 @entity69 in @entity66 as @entity68 competed in @entity165 @entity50 took 7,000 videos of matches , goals , players , free - kicks , corners and penalties with him to @entity66 after his first season with the @entity174 ended in sequential 3 - 0 defeats in the @entity176 and @entity177 finals , he tried a ‘ but @entity179 is an honourable man ’ speech on his players			1
in his 10 - minute monologue he repeated his ‘ full responsibility ’ but basically accused his squad of being cowardly , overpaid , shirkers who had bungled a chance of glory and betrayed the fans			2
someone in the dressing room recorded the fork - tongued diatribe and made the audio public			0
the ultimate betrayal , but caused by disengagement with the @entity99			0
the plus - side — as with the @entity153 team which wowed @entity199 en route to dismantling @entity201 in 2013 — is that when his fanatical methods impact on his players and temporarily makes them super-fit , his teams can thrill			0
the down - side is the law of diminishing returns			0
something the local media understand far more quickly than anyone else			0
a couple of weeks ago , after a run of poor results , he lectured them			0
‘ it ’s completely clear that you ’ve got it all wrong , ’ he accused			1
‘ in the first part of the season , when we were winning , i was “ immense ” and the whole of @entity33 football should “ adopt my methods ”			2
now you say the opposite			0
@entity50 ’s bible states : ‘ running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything ’ ‘ it ’s what has happened to me for the last 30 years			1
in negative moments everyone abandons you			0
‘ in life we are attracted by what smells good and we flee from what smells bad			2
success improves your aroma and defeat gives you an odour			0
nobody , nobody , will accompany you to gaining success but everyone will flock to you to share your success once it ’s gained			2
’ the latter part of which should n’t , really , have appealed to his players			2
they won the next match 6 - 1 at @entity250			0
@entity6 are a different matter			2
but to return to the original idea , this is where ‘ @entity254 ’ yearns to be			1
@entity255 recalls that when @entity50 ’s @entity68 were playing @entity256 away , he came in from the warm - up and told them : ‘ in a street fight , there are two kinds of guy			1
the one who strikes , sees blood , is repelled and recoils			0
then there ’s one who sees blood and goes all - in to finish off the other			2
well lads ... i swear i smell blood in the air out there			0
’ so of what will @entity50 smell on sunday night ? success ? failure ? blood ?			1

@entity5 manager @entity50 has *previously* been *nicknamed* ‘ @entity254 ’
@entity50 ’s bible says : ‘ running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything ’
