but as the camera sweeps across the map , it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the @entity8 fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message			0

@entity1 spoof @entity11 was produced by campaign group @entity26 , which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern , midland and south - coast regions of @entity21 made by @entity26 ( @entity31 of @entity32 ) , it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions can not fund vital services , while other areas moan about not having luxuries			1
in the opening scene are characters based on those from the @entity42 - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south			0
among them is a parody of @entity47 , a ruthless ruler , who is informed : ' the seven kingdoms prosper once more			2
' we must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north ... our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms			1
' @entity56 northerner lord @entity55 ( played in the actual series by @entity58 as @entity59 ) is seen right , in the foreground			2
he says to the evil @entity47 of the south ( left : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them ' in the film , queen @entity72 is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son @entity47 enter honourable northerner lord @entity55 ( played in the actual series by @entity58 as @entity59 ) : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them			1
' ' our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling			0
' but at every turn , @entity88 's entreaties are scoffed at			0

however , the film has been criticised by @entity94 vice-chairman and former local government minister @entity95			1

at the end of the short film , the king fires an arrow at @entity106 , whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at according to @entity26 , by march 2016 , the amount of funding cuts for regions will be : ' it 's a complete waste of money , but also a complete fiction			1
it 's missing the key plot - there 's a black hole in the @entity121 's coffers , thanks to the bad old days of @entity123			1
' his hand of the king , baron @entity127 , may now eye the throne , but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes , meaning less money to go around for local services			2
' meanwhile , @entity136 councillor sir @entity135 , chairman of @entity26 said : ' whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt , the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required			1
' clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents , whilst others have more than enough , is clearly unfair and unsustainable , ' he told the @entity153			0
he added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening			0
according to @entity26 , since 2010 , local government in @entity21 has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding			2
