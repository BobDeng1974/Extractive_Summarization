by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 07:37 est , 1 january 2013 @entity1 has used her @entity3 speech to launch an open attack on the @entity5 as she attempts to win a third term as @entity8 chancellor in 2013			1
in a move that will be grasped by @entity10 , mrs @entity1 told @entity8 that she will repress @entity12 's biggest financial markets and fight to strengthen the @entity14 's grip on banking			1
the chancellor openly blames the financial collapse of the @entity19 economy and light - touch regulation spearheaded by @entity21 for the @entity23 crisis			1
stand - off : in a direct attack on the @entity5 , @entity8 chancellor @entity1 said @entity12 's largest markets needed to be controlled further to protect the @entity23 battle : mrs @entity1 is aiming to win a third term as chancellor and she believes that @entity21 and the @entity19 are to blame for @entity12 's financial markets throttling financial centres like @entity32 would allow her to work towards her dream of a @entity12 superstate with almost complete banking and economic union across the continent			1
speech : @entity39 will make a pledge this month to wrestle more powers back from @entity42 ' the crisis is a long way from being beaten , ' mrs @entity1 said on @entity8 television last night			1
' internationally , more needs to be done in order to exercise control over the financial markets			1
the world has not sufficiently learnt the lessons of the devastating 2008 financial crisis			2
never again can we allow irresponsibility like back then to happen			0
in a social market economy , the state is the guardian of order â€” and that is something people should be able to count on			0
' @entity8 will have a general election in september and mrs @entity1 wants to win a third term in the @entity63 - the @entity8 chancellery			1
her relationship with @entity39 is fragile and the prime minister is preparing a keynote speech this month where he will demand that more powers are transferred from @entity42 back to @entity32			1
financial services , based mainly in the @entity5 , make up 10 per cent of the @entity21 economy and mr @entity39 will fight tooth and nail to protect it			1
but @entity8 has already signed up to a new banking transaction tax being touted by @entity74 , however , the @entity21 can opt out			1
even though @entity1 's conservative party holds a commanding 10 - point lead in opinion polls over the @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , the centre - left opposition @entity79 and their @entity81 allies have a chance of taking power because @entity1 's coalition allies , the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) have slumped badly and may not win seats			1
the @entity19 ambassador to @entity89 has called on the @entity21 and @entity12 to up its defence spending as it can not rely on @entity19 any longer			2
@entity93 says cash saved after 2014 when all @entity89 troops leave @entity96 must be pumped back into military budgets			0
he said that the @entity19 will be focussing its money elsewhere - particularly in @entity99 and @entity100			0
' if we do n't start soon in investing in those capabilities then the gap between the @entity19 and the rest is going to grow			0
if we have problems , they will be even worse , ' he said			0
the @entity107 in @entity21 is privately urging @entity39 to withdraw from @entity96 early to save more money			2
but @entity19 says @entity89 members should put the cash into arms			0
but political analysts believe @entity1 still has the most options to form a government after the vote			2
she could lead a right - left grand coalition with the @entity79 as she did from 2005 to 2009 or a coalition with the pro-environment greens party			0
in what is viewed as a speech that will kick - start the election race , @entity1 urged @entity8 to be more patient even though the euro zone crisis has already dragged on for three years			1
she drew a line linking @entity8 prosperity to a prosperous @entity14			2
' for our prosperity and our solidarity we need to strike the right balance , ' @entity1 said			2
' the @entity12 sovereign debt crisis shows how important this balance is			2
' the reforms that we 've introduced are beginning to have an impact , ' she said			0
' nevertheless we need to have further continued patience			0
the crisis is far from over			0
' but in face of slowing economic growth , @entity1 also warned that conditions could be more difficult in 2013 than in 2012			1
' i know that many people are naturally concerned going into the new year , ' she said			0
' and the economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year			0
but we should n't let that get us down ; rather it should spur us on			0
