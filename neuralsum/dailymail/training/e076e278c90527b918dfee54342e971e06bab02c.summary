by @entity0 for @entity1 after spending $ 184,000 on a new motor , most people would - at the very least - expect the car to have working doors			2
but if the model in question is the rarest @entity8 ever made - one of just of 15 and a personal favourite of the @entity10 - perhaps you could make an exception			2
the 1962 @entity13 , built without doors or side - pillars , fetched more than double its estimated value of $ 70,000 at @entity18 sale in @entity19 this week			1
only 15 models of the @entity13 were made by @entity21 in 1962 the car , built without doors or side - pillars , was bought for $ 184,000 at @entity18 sale in @entity19 this week the car , which has a tiny 849cc engine producing a modest 34bhp , was built 52 years ago by @entity21 - with all but one being made as left - hand drives with the intention of being shipped over to the @entity28			1
the one right - hand drive that was produced was loaned to the @entity30 and it is thought that the @entity10 enjoyed driving the golf - buggy - like motor around @entity33			0
at the time , the @entity34 wrote : ' @entity10 , a knowledgeable motorist , doubtless enjoys travelling in this unconventional little vehicle as much as she does in her @entity36			0
' despite being 52 - years - old , the car has had just three owners since it was first shipped to @entity39 and has covered only 12,000 miles - an average of 4.4 miles per week			0
at $ 184,000 , it is a world record price paid for a @entity8 at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962			1
despite being 52 years old , the vehicle has done just 12,000 miles , having been kept in a showroom in @entity19 for most of its existence the 1962 model has a tiny 849cc engine developing a modest 34bhp and is the rarest mini ever to be made at $ 184,000 , it is a world record price paid for a @entity8 at auction and 200 times what the original model cost back in 1962 the car also cost the frivolous buyer $ 157,000 more than the cheapest @entity8 currently made by @entity58 is worth			1
