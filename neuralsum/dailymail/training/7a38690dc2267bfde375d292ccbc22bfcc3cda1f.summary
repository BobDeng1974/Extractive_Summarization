by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 2 may 2013 a postman has been saved from a life dependent upon dialysis thanks to a colleague who gave him a new kidney			1
@entity6 , 48 , suffers from polycystic kidney disease , which caused cysts to form and his kidneys to fail			1
doctors warned him that he would need kidney dialysis to clean his blood within months , unless a donor could be found to allow him to have a transplant			1
all of his family members were tested , but none were suitable donors , so mr @entity6 faced a race against time to find a compatible organ			1
@entity6 ( right ) was given a new kidney by @entity23 ( left ) after his polycystic kidney disease caused his kidneys to fail to his relief , his colleague , @entity23 , 44 , offered to be tested - and was found to be a perfect match			1
the pair underwent surgery earlier this month and grandfather - of - three , mr @entity6 , is now returning to full health			1
he said : ‘ it is like winning the lottery because all of a sudden i have gone from falling asleep most days , to three weeks later i am absolutely buzzing			2
‘ it has been very emotional			0
@entity36 at work one day @entity38 , as we call him , came up to me and said “ by the way , i want to give you my kidney ”			2
‘ i was floored , it was quite amazing really			0
’ without a transplant , mr @entity6 would have needed kidney dialysis to clean his blood because his kidney function had dropped to 24 per cent before he received the new kidney from mr @entity23 ( right ) , mr @entity6 ( left ) was so exhausted that he could only work part - time speaking of his donation , mr @entity23 said : ‘ it is the fact it makes such a difference to somebody else			1
‘ people lose track of that in their lives			0
every now and again something comes along that allows you to make a difference			0
‘ luckily , i got to do that for somebody else			0
’ the postmen have worked together at the @entity65 depot in @entity66 , @entity67 , for eight years – mr @entity23 as a door - to - door postman and mr @entity6 in customer services			1
they also both own allotments and became good friends through gardening			0
after leaving the army 16 years ago , mr @entity6 was diagnosed with the genetic kidney condition			1
it causes cysts – fluid - filled sacs – to develop in the kidneys which mean they gradually lose more and more of their function			1
the two men underwent surgery at @entity84 in @entity85 on april 5 symptoms include abdominal pain , blood in the urine and high blood pressure			0
eventually , it can cause kidney failure which causes symptoms including tiredness and shortness of breath			1
if the condition is severe enough , the patient will need dialysis or a kidney transplant			1
there is no treatment for polycystic kidney disease			1
last year mr @entity6 ’s kidney function dropped dramatically to 24 per cent meaning he was placed on the transplant list			1
however , no one came forward as a match and he began to resign himself to giving up his job for a future on dialysis			1
they are now recovering and mr @entity6 is looking forward to getting back to normality and to returning to long distance running he said : ‘ i had been seeing my kidney function decrease and i was heading towards dialysis , i was not far off at all			1
‘ the plan was always to have dialysis because nobody had come forward to give me a kidney , there were just no matches			1
it is a genetic condition that causes multiple cysts to develop on the kidneys			2
symptoms tend to begin in adulthood and include abdominal pain , high blood pressure and blood in the urine			0
over time the condition causes the kidneys to lose more and more of their function			0
eventually it can lead to kidney disease which has symptoms including tiredness , swollen ankles and shortness of breath			1
there is no treatment so patients sometimes need dialysis or a transplant			2
the condition affects one in every 1,000 people			0
‘ as my kidney function failed life had narrowed down to a sort of blinkered view of the future , i could n't really do a lot and i was on half days because i needed to sleep so much			2
‘ @entity155 offered me his kidney			2
‘ for a live donor the success rate is 98 per cent			0
there is always a risk and that chance it is going to fail but when someone says it is 98 per cent you have to go for it			0
’ after months of tests , they underwent surgery at @entity84 , @entity85 , on april 5			0
mr @entity23 , from @entity169 , north @entity67 , said : ‘ somebody told me one day that you do n't have to be deceased to be a donor , you can give certain organs while you are still alive , and i have to confess that thought never really crossed my mind			2
‘ there is not enough publicity , everybody thinks you have to be dead , nobody really realises you can be a live donor			0
‘ i think that 's why it 's gone so well , the kidney was live and functioning really well , so it was a lot easier to transplant			2
’ the pair became friends because they both enjoy gardening on their allotments mr @entity6 , from @entity66 , is now looking forward to returning to a normal life and to resuming long distance running			2
‘ i 'm very much into my running , i was running up to 40 miles a week , but i had to stop six or seven months ago , ’ he said			0
‘ i really , really miss it so i 'm really looking forward to getting back into it , i did the @entity193 three years ago so i look forward to doing that again			0
‘ they have told me i can do what i want , no food restrictions , nothing			0
‘ i intend to travel and do everything i could n't			0
it had all gone so narrow and i could n't really do any of that , now it has all opened up			0
