click here to read @entity2 's match report from @entity3 towards the end of this remarkable game at @entity3 , @entity6 managed to make a save from @entity8 while looking in the opposite direction			1
at the other end , @entity11 ’ goalkeeping for @entity12 was characterised by one moment when he dived the wrong way and another when he fell over			1
not surprisingly , @entity16 scored on both occasions			1
it would be wrong to say @entity11 – @entity12 ’s reserve goalkeeper – was to blame for this defeat			1
he did n’t have a terrible game			0
@entity6 ( left ) pulled off a number of outstanding saves during the games denying @entity8 @entity11 was wrong - footed by @entity25 for the first and then fell over for @entity28 's goal @entity29 and his @entity16 's celebrate after making it 3 - 0 at @entity3 to wrap up the victory @entity32 : is @entity33 the end for some @entity12 players ? @entity36 ratings : @entity37 endures day to forget in front of goal nevertheless , the @entity40 ’s afternoon was perhaps symptomatic of @entity12 ’s current problems in that if something can currently go wrong then it probably will			1
here at @entity3 , @entity12 managed to lose while playing the better football			1
they managed to create the better chances and take none of them			0
as odd as it sounds , this was an afternoon that actually served to remind us that @entity12 still have some very good players			2
at times , @entity54 ’ team played some incisive , dextrous football			2
in their better moments , they passed the ball well and moved intelligently			0
their great rivals , on the other hand , were only sporadically fluent			0
at times there was very little flow to their football			1
@entity68 ’s team , however , broke with purpose on some occasions and devastatingly on others			0
their goals came from rapier thrusts while @entity12 seemed to invent new ways not to score			2
crucially , @entity16 did not make the mistakes in their own half that @entity12 did			1
@entity77 looked to be offside but made it 2 - 0 to @entity16 in the first - half @entity54 ' side played better football than the hosts but were ultimately soundly beaten this is not to denigrate @entity16			1
they are still finding their way under @entity86			0
the @entity89 coach ’s inability to field a settled side continues to hamper progress in what @entity16 hope will one day be viewed as a pivotal season in the @entity95 years			1
afterwards , @entity86 spoke about how easily his players gave the ball away			0
it is a recurring theme			0
the @entity16 manager , however , will not have woken this morning worried about what he can do that is new when he arrives at training today			2
his team have six wins from six and , despite their shortcomings , are at least moving forwards			0
@entity54 has no such comfort			0
one of a football manager ’s most debilitating problems is one that refuses to go away no matter how many different ways he tries to solve it			0
as he admitted after the game , @entity54 ’ team ’s defending just will not get better			0
at times there is only so much a manager can do			0
the @entity119 midfielder @entity118 was one of @entity12 ’s better players on sunday but he trailed to track @entity25 midway through the first half and @entity16 took the lead			1
@entity118 was branded ' lazy ' after an ' unforgivable ' lack of marking by @entity125 pundit @entity124 @entity68 's men posses the quality of winning games when not playing well this season speaking on tv , former @entity12 defender @entity129 called @entity118 ’s lack of diligence ‘ unforgivable ’ and ‘ lazy ’ and he was similarly unimpressed as @entity133 failed to get close enough to @entity28 for @entity16 ’s second goal and @entity135 presented the ball straight to @entity25 in the build - up to the third			1
for @entity12 every day is @entity138			1
it is impossible for them to move forwards while they are chained to this uncertainty			0
@entity54 insists he does not need a defensive coach			0
if that is the case then maybe he just needs better defenders			0
on sunday @entity16 were once again forced in to something new at the back			1
a training ground injury to @entity149 saw @entity150 rushed back while @entity151 dropped back to bolster a three - man defensive line that also featured the club ’s best nuts and bolts defender @entity156			2
once again it had a look of make - do - and - mend about it but @entity16 are learning to get through			1
crucially , some players are improving			0
@entity151 was exceptional – we expect that – but @entity163 and @entity164 have become far better wing - backs than anybody would ever have imagined and it is these things , these small improvements , that , when put together , can make the difference			0
@entity151 was exceptional in defence but @entity16 had several other unsung heroes on sunday @entity163 and @entity164 impressed in the wing - back positions against rivals @entity12 @entity12 have no such improvement to bolster them as they anticipate challenges ahead			1
indeed , on this evidence and that of recent games , it is hard to imagine them heading to @entity181 in the @entity182 on wednesday without encountering further problems			0
@entity54 ’ decision to select @entity11 in goal was peculiar			2
@entity12 ’s number one @entity186 is not really good enough but his understudy certainly is not			1
the 32 - year - old ’s first contribution was to slice a clearance up in to the air , his second to dive the wrong way as @entity25 struck blow number one from the edge of the penalty area			2
goalkeeping was not what killed @entity12 , though			2
they continue to look like a team that does n’t really believe it can win and at the end captain @entity199 looked resigned rather than crestfallen			1
it was an interesting image			0
as his contract issue rumbles on at @entity203 , one wonders if he will ever be back here in @entity12 colours again			2
@entity199 looked resigned rather than crestfallen after the defeat at @entity3			1

it would be wrong to say @entity11 was to blame for 3 - 0 defeat on sunday
@entity6 pulled off several *miraculous* saves at @entity3
at times there was very little flow to @entity16 's football
@entity186 should *n't* have been dropped for such a big fixture
for @entity12 every day is @entity138
@entity199 looked resigned rather than crestfallen after the game
