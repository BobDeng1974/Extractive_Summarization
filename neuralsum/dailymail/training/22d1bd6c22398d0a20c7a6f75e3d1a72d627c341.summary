it said health workers were ‘ inexperienced ’ at dealing with force - feeding and under - estimated the danger to the new baby			1
@entity47 died in a @entity49 hospital after fragments of food in her lungs triggered a bout of pneumonia in march last year			2
detectives from @entity57 ’s child abuse command were brought in when a post-mortem examination revealed she may have been force - fed for up to six months			1
the pathologist who examined her body told police he had ‘ never seen so much food ’ in the lungs of a dead child before			2
@entity8 admitted using the spout of a small china milk jug to hold baby @entity10 ’s tiny mouth open to tip in food as she weaned her			2
she fed her baby rice , @entity72 corn porridge and chicken soup up to three times a day at their home in @entity77 , @entity49			0
the nurse admitted that her baby often vomited after being fed , but said it did not worry her because her other children had been the same			0
she insisted the feeding technique was ‘ entirely perfect ’ because she had seen it being used in @entity39 , adding she also used a syringe to feed her baby milk			2
@entity8 , pictured in court in an artist 's impression with her husband who was found not guilty , had wept in court after denying harming her baby she told the court : ‘ i was scared – i come from a place where children do n’t eat and they starve and they die , and i do n’t want my child to starve and die			1
’ but experts are convinced @entity10 must have been obviously distressed , choking and spluttering as the torture continued			0

she blamed her senile 68 - year - old mother , who cared for them for long periods in @entity39 during their early years			0
but officials still failed to act after doctors sparked a formal child - protection inquiry when she went to hospital to give birth to @entity10 in 2009			0
one medic spotted that @entity8 ’s youngest daughter had a mouth injury that later required plastic surgery			1
investigators concluded it was caused by the rough rim of a plastic cup as she was force - fed. officials found all three siblings suffered breathing difficulties , growth problems and were left so traumatised by force - feeding that they were scared to eat			1

hospital worker was ' obsessed with daughter 's weight ' and poured food into her mouth
infant died from pneumonia caused from meat and cereal found in her lungs
knowing that all three of @entity8 ’s older children suffered *similar* abuse and serious health problems as a result of *inhaling* food ;
failing to follow up a warning at least four years before the baby ’s death that the shocking practice should stop ;
being ‘ *insufficiently* *sensitive* ’ to the ‘ *significance* of cultural *values* ’ attached to eating in the family ;
a belief that @entity8 ’s actions were motivated by genuine concern for her baby ; and
failure to *intervene* even after doctors realised one of her other children needed plastic surgery to repair a force - feeding injury .
