the manager refused to divulge details about those talks at his weekly pre-match press conference or reveal the reasons behind his decision to resign			0

' news of @entity0 's resignation emerged just hours before the @entity67 champions were due to take on @entity68 last friday night			1
@entity0 , who famously said he ' did not do walking away ' after the club 's liquidation crisis , batted off questions about why he had chosen to resign following the shock 2 - 0 defeat at @entity74			1
and a week later , he was still in no mood to disclose why he was choosing to bring his reign to an end			0
' i would keep that private , ' he said			0
' i would n't comment at all about why i have made that decision but now that i have , i can assure the @entity1 supporters , who are the most important people , that i am 100 per cent focused on continuing the job			1

' a statement released to the @entity13 on monday confirming his impending departure also revealed that under the terms of @entity0 's contract , his salary would almost double to £ 750,000 a year			1
that was seen by many fans as an attempt to heap pressure on the manager at a time when the business needs £ 8.3million before april 1 just to keep the lights on			0
@entity0 , though , insisted he ' was n't surprised ' that the board had chosen to announce those details			1
he also tried to play down reports claiming he had fallen out with former @entity1 strike partner @entity123			2

the 52 - year - old insists he would be sad to say goodbye to @entity1 once the end finally comes			1
he said : ' would i miss the job ? that 's a good question ! i would think you would have to miss the job			2
