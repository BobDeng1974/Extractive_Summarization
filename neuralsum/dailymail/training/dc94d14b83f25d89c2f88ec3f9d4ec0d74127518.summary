by @entity0 published : 20:35 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 02:56 est , 22 june 2012 ' career ruined ' : model - maker @entity2 is suing an architecture firm for £ 280,000 after severing a finger on a circular during a work experience placement a promising young artist who severed a finger on a circular saw during a work experience placement is suing the company for £ 280,000			1
@entity2 , 28 , said her dream of a film industry career was destroyed when her left index finger was sliced off while operating the unguarded machinery on her second day at @entity18 - based architecture firm @entity17			1
the finger was re-attached by surgeons , but says she has not been been able to use her left hand properly since			0
she is now at the centre of a test case in which senior judges are being asked to define what is meant by ' disability '			0
miss @entity2 , of @entity27 , was awarded around £ 80,000 damages at @entity29 in april last year , but her lawyers are now arguing at @entity18 's @entity31 that it was nowhere near enough for the devastating impact on her future			1
they say she should have received nearly £ 280,000			0
miss @entity2 graduated with a first - class honours degree in model making from @entity36 in july 2006 and her ambition was to pursue a career making sets and props for film and theatre			1
but disaster struck on the second day of a work experience placement with @entity17 , when her left index finger was cut off by an unguarded circular saw while she was cutting wood - without supervision - for a model			1
although surgeons managed to re-attach her finger , she was left with reduced function in her left hand and her lawyers said the finger was ' more hindrance than help '			1
she also continues to suffer pain in her left hand and post-traumatic stress disorder , which has affected her ability to work with machinery			0
as a result of the accident , she had to take an administrative job at a college instead of pursuing her chosen career path			2
during the hearing at the county court , @entity2 told judge @entity66 she was ' embarrassed ' by a sculpture she created of a @entity69 and @entity69 character - made after her accident			2
however , the judge said he could see ' little difference ' in quality between that and her earlier work and he did not detect she had lost any of her ' artistic flair or skill '			0
he added : ' i do not for one moment trivialise the injury , nor its consequences , but it is plain to me from what i have observed that the index finger is an inconvenience rather than a disability			1
' test case : miss @entity2 was awarded around £ 80,000 damages last year , but her lawyers are now arguing at @entity18 's @entity31 ( pictured ) that it was nowhere near enough to compensate for the impact on her future the judge also accepted evidence from one of @entity2 's former visiting tutors that he had worked on the @entity97 film with a model maker who had a prosthetic hand			1
judge @entity66 concluded : ' from the evidence which has been put before me , i am unable to find that this young woman , either as a matter of fact or law , fulfils the criteria of a disabled person			0
' when it came to assessing her loss of future earnings , the judge said a career in model making was ' simply beyond ' her - not because she lacked skill , but because she had lost motivation due to the accident and was now ' far behind the pack '			2
however , he found she could earn at least as much in another field as she would have earned as a freelance model maker , without steady employment			0
challenging the judge 's decision , @entity2 's lawyers argued he was wrong to find she was ' not disabled ' - which greatly reduced her payout for loss of future earnings			1
her barrister , @entity128 , said : ' the judge appears to have wrongly concluded that , because the claimant can and does still do things , including with her injured hand , and because she can continue to do things in part by avoiding use of that hand , then she is not to be regarded as " disabled " for these purposes			0
' he also said the judge should have found that her ongoing phobia of machinery is a further disability and that , had he found she was disabled , her loss of future earnings would have been calculated differently			0
@entity143 , for @entity17 , argued judge @entity66 reached the correct decision on the evidence before him and that the level of damages he awarded was appropriate			2
lord @entity148 , sitting with lord @entity149 and sir @entity150 , reserved giving judgment on the case until an unspecified later date .			0

@entity2 awarded £ 80,000 damages last year after slicing off index finger
but lawyers are now demanding more compensation at the @entity31
claim her dreams of pursuing career making film sets has been destroyed
