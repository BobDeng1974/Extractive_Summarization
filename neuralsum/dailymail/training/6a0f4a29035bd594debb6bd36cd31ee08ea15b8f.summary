by @entity0 published : 18:25 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 06:32 est , 13 october 2013 @entity4 ’s ‘ leading ladies ’ advertising campaign has failed to win new customers for the ailing store , a new poll reveals			1
the ‘ make or break ’ campaign , launched amid much fanfare last month , has flopped because it has failed to resonate with middle - class customers , research suggests			2
to promote the new autumn clothing range , the company drafted in a dozen ‘ iconic ’ women , such as @entity15 boxing gold medal winner @entity14 and ballerina @entity16			1
not so iconic : according to industry insiders , @entity17 was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle @entity24 but a survey by polling company @entity27 @entity26 has found that despite @entity4 spending up to £ 5 million on the advertising blitz , consumers have been unimpressed			2
the survey found that nearly 40 per cent of the adult population had seen the advertising by last week after the campaign had been in full swing for more than a month			2
but the number that said they planned to buy @entity4 clothes increased only slightly , from 23 per cent to 24 per cent			1
among women , the figure was slightly higher at 25 per cent			0
@entity27 chief operating officer @entity40 said : ‘ it ’s no secret @entity4 ’s retail arm , particularly women ’s fashion , is struggling and our research shows that while consumers are aware of the campaign , it has not yet made them want to go out and buy @entity4 clothing			1
’ according to industry insiders , @entity17 was the only figure in the adverts regarded by many as a household name and an icon to middle @entity24			0
the inclusion of controversial artist @entity54 is believed to have actually shocked many of @entity4 ’s traditionally conservative customers			1
ms @entity54 said when the campaign launched that she spent ‘ half my life ’ wearing @entity4 pyjamas , but to many she is most remembered for her ‘ my bed ’ art installation , which included condoms , a pair of knickers and an empty cigarette packet			2
@entity24 's leading ladies from left to right : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity16 , @entity72 , @entity17 , @entity14 and @entity54 last month , @entity4 chief executive @entity73 denied reports that the new autumn range was make or break for the store after two years of declining sales			1
he is understood to have insisted to investors that the campaign is working well and that more time is needed to revive the chain ’s fortunes			0
a new internet strategy is being planned for next @entity85 insiders said the campaign is nevertheless seen as the benchmark against which he will be measured			0
the survey supports concerns raised by @entity91 analysts last week over the success of the new clothing ranges at @entity4			0
the company declined to comment on the figures ahead of its crucial trading statement in three weeks ’ time			0
but brokers at @entity99 and @entity100 are among those who believe @entity4 will say next month that fashion sales so far this year have been worse than last year , before mr @entity73 ’s latest turnaround plan was set in motion .			0
