@entity0 has admitted @entity1 can not afford to rebuild their team every summer if they are to secure the stability they crave			1
the @entity1 head coach presided over yet another major overhaul of the squad last summer after pulling off an unlikely escape act from the jaws of relegation			2
but two and a half months into the new campaign , the 46 - year - old @entity11 finds himself fighting fires once again with his team having succumbed to a self - inflicted 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity17 on saturday - seven days after being trounced 8 - 0 at @entity18			1
@entity0 looks frustrated during @entity1 's 2 - 0 loss against @entity17 on saturday afternoon @entity20 looks frustrated after @entity1 lose 2 - 0 at the @entity21 to @entity17 @entity0 was in contemplative mood after another soul - destroying reverse , but pointed to the continuity in @entity27 's squad compared to the state of flux in his as he started the process of analysing just what had gone wrong			1
he said : ' i 'll tell you one instance that you probably do n't know : eight players from the @entity17 starting line - up last year are here , they are in @entity17 's squad ; seven players from @entity1 's starting @entity39 last year here are not even at @entity1			1
' that shows you there is an advantage for people who have a squad that is together and you add quality and what you are missing , and another team where you start from zero every single year , and every year you need to see if you have got the characters , if you have got the quantity , if you have got the quality , if they understand the game , if they can defend as a team , if you are going to play long or short or passing ... ' it 's a little bit of a disadvantage without being an excuse , but we need to make sure that we do n't do it any more			2
we do n't want to start next year again from zero and another seven players in the starting @entity39 ' it is a fact that @entity0 is still trying to mould a team from the players with which he was presented by sporting director @entity64 during the summer , although there were only three members of the new intake among his starting xi against the @entity68 - @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
@entity0 's @entity1 side sit around the relegation zone after losing 2 - 0 against @entity17 at the @entity21 @entity17 's @entity74 shoots to score past @entity1 goalkeeper @entity20 ironically , it was two of his longer - serving and usually more dependable men who were culpable in a defeat which highlighted the club 's depressing capacity to self - harm			1
the home side had held firm in the face of sustained pressure from @entity17 's slick passing game with @entity86 and @entity87 feeding @entity74 , @entity88 and @entity89 to place a stranglehold on the ball			2
but with half an hour gone , central defender @entity93 , under pressure from the admirable @entity74 , attempted a back - pass to @entity20 from the best part of 50 yards , but only managed to scuff the ball into the @entity98 international 's path and saw him sprint away before lifting a delicate shot over the advancing keeper			0
to their credit , the @entity1 rallied after the break and made a genuine fist of forcing their way back into the game , only to succumb once again at the death when @entity20 , who was beaten three times last weekend by team - mates , allowed @entity71 's back - pass to get away from him and @entity74 pounced to double his tally			1
@entity20 can only watch as @entity74 's ball flies above him and into his goal @entity93 was at fault for @entity74 's second goal at the @entity21 on saturday afternoon @entity0 said : ' they are human beings and anything can happen on a football pitch			2
these are actions that i do n't think can repeat themselves , i do n't think you can train for them			0
' they are just mistakes that happen in football and , unfortunately , it 's going a little bit against us at the moment			0
' if @entity0 and his players face another long and difficult week - they travel to @entity131 next monday evening - @entity17 headed south having brought a tough few days to a more than satisfactory conclusion and purring over summer acquisition @entity74			1
@entity89 told the club 's official website , www.arsenal.com : ' he 's a world - class player - everyone saw that at the @entity137			0
he 's proved that and he 's played for @entity139 , where we 've all seen what he 's done			0
' he 's an unbelievable player and part of his game is his character and his hard work - that 's where he 's got both his goals from			0
' he reminds me of @entity149 when he chases everything down and he makes nothing into something			0
he 's done that for us twice today and he 's scored goals at important times for us			0

@entity1 lost 2 - 0 to @entity17 at the weekend
