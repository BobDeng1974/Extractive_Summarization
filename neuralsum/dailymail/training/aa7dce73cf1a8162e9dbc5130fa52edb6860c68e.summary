by @entity0 for @entity1 hundreds of lakes and seas are known of on @entity4 , @entity6 's largest moon , filled not with water but with hydrocarbons such as methane			1
most of these bodies of liquid are thought to be replenished by rainfall from clouds in the moon 's atmosphere , but now research says underground reservoirs may also be feeding them			1
in a study scientists found that subsurface ' springs ' of propane and ethane may be contributing to some bodies of liquid - and the effects may be noticeable on the surface			1
a researcher in @entity29 says bodies of liquid on @entity4 may be fed by underground springs			1
this artist 's rendering shows a cross-section of the surface and subsurface of @entity38 's @entity4			2
an ' alkanofer ' is a resevoir of liquid hydrocarbons , while clathrates are compounds that trap other substances the study was carried out by dr @entity46 , a research associate for the @entity48 spacecraft , currently in orbit around @entity6 , at the @entity50 , @entity29			2
he examined how @entity4 ’s methane rainfall would interact with icy materials in underground reservoirs			1
and with colleagues he found that runoff from this rainfall was likely leading to the formation of springs of propane and ethane , which in turn were feeding the lakes and seas			1
with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity4 resembles a frozen version of @entity67 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			0
because @entity4 is smaller than @entity67 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space			0
as on @entity67 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity4 are about seven @entity67 years long			0
@entity4 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity83 , better known on @entity67 as natural gas			2
regular @entity67 - water , @entity87 , would be frozen solid on @entity4 where the surface temperature is @entity89 ( -292 ° f )			2
with @entity4 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity67 's raindrops			0
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
the results of this could be noticed on @entity4 's surface , meaning scientists may be able work out what is happening underground simply by looking at the moon from space			1
the scientists modeled how a subsurface reservoir of liquid hydrocarbons , also called an ' alkanofer , ' once filled with methane rainfall runoff , would diffuse through @entity4 's porous , icy crust			1
they found that this diffusion could cause a new reservoir to form where the bottom of the original underground reservoir meets layers of non-porous ice			0
importantly , this process would continue up to @entity4 's surface			2
lakes fed by these propane or ethane subsurface reservoirs would show the same kind of composition , whereas those fed by rainfall would be different and contain methane , nitrogen , and trace amounts of argon and carbon monoxide			2
in other words , the composition of the lake could indicate what is happening deep underground			0
‘ we knew that a significant fraction of the lakes on @entity4 's surface might possibly be connected with hidden bodies of liquid beneath @entity4 's crust , but we just did n't know how they would interact , ’ said @entity46			2
‘ now , we have a better idea of what these hidden lakes or oceans could be like			0
’ the finding was made when studying how methane rain interacts with lakes on @entity4 ( pictured )			1
it was found that rainfall runoff was likely feeding underground resevoirs			1
these in turn would change in chemical composition before adding to existing lakes and seas the process of underground reservoirs feeding lakes and seas ( illustrated ) could be spotted on the surface , meaning scientists may be able to work out what is happening underground on @entity4 just by observing the moon from space clathrates are compounds in which water forms a crystal structure with small cages that trap other substances like methane and ethane			1
clathrates that contain methane are found on @entity67 in some polar and ocean sediments			0
on @entity4 , the surface pressure and temperature should allow clathrates to form when liquid hydrocarbons come into contact with water ice , which is a major component of the moon 's crust			2
these clathrate layers could remain stable as far down as several miles below @entity4 's surface			0
@entity46 and his colleagues came to the conclusion when they found that the formation of materials called clathrates changes the chemical composition of the rainfall runoff that feeds hydrocarbon ' aquifers ' - reservoirs of liquid underground			1
one of the peculiar properties of clathrates is that they trap and split molecules into a mix of liquid and solid phases , in a process called fractionation			0
@entity4 's underground clathrate reservoirs would interact with and fractionate the liquid methane from the original underground hydrocarbon lake , slowly changing its composition			1
eventually the original methane aquifer would be turned into a propane or ethane aquifer			0
' our study shows that the composition of @entity4 's underground liquid reservoirs can change significantly through their interaction with the icy subsurface , provided the reservoirs are cut off from the atmosphere for some period of time , ' said dr @entity224 of @entity226 's @entity225 ( @entity225 ) , one of three co-authors of the study with dr @entity46			1
importantly , the chemical transformations taking place underground would affect @entity4 's surface			2
lakes and rivers fed by springs from propane or ethane subsurface reservoirs would show the same kind of composition , whereas those fed by rainfall would be different and contain a significant fraction of methane			1
this means researchers could examine the composition of @entity4 's surface lakes to learn something about what is happening deep underground , said @entity46			1
