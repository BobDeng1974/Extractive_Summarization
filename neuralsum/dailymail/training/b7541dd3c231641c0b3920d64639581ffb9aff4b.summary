with green spaces being replaced by building sites and large - scale developments around the world , architects are constantly looking for ways to replace them			2
one such concept , devised by a team @entity8 - based architects , uses towering structures built with layers of green space in which flora and fauna could live			1
called the @entity15 , the structures would have space for birds and animals to live above ground , and would be bedded under the sea for fish and coral to inhabit			2
the @entity24 ( illustrated ) was created by @entity8 - based architects from @entity26			1
it was designed to add high density , green spots to towns and cities and each floating structure would be built using offshore technology and resources			1
the @entity15 would be made up of layers in which flora and fauna could live ‘ urbanisation and climate change put a lot of pressure on available space for nature in city centres , ’ explained @entity37			2
‘ new initiatives for adding extra park zones to a city are rare			0
' yet these kind of additional habitats for birds , bees , bats and other small animals could bring a lot of positive green effects to the environment of a city			0
’ @entity26 ’s concept is called the @entity15 and it was designed to add high density , green spots to towns and cities			1
according to designs , it would be a floating structure built using layers where animals and birds can live			1
to hold it in place , @entity26 claims @entity69 would be moored to the sea bed using a cable system			1
under the water , ( concept illustrated ) the @entity15 would provide a habitat for small water creatures or , if the climate allowed for it , artificial coral reefs the structures would not accessible by man , and would be built using offshore technology and resources , quite similar to how oil storage towers are built and powered out at sea			1
the idea is that large oil companies would donate a @entity86 , and the trees could be built on rivers , seas , lakes and harbours ( illustrated )			0
the height and depth of the @entity15 could also be adjusted depending on where it was placed the structures would not accessible by man , and would be built using offshore technology and resources , similar to how oil storage towers are built and powered out at sea			1

‘ the beauty of the design is that it provides a solution , and at the same time does not cost expensive space on land			0
‘ while the effect of the species living in the @entity148 will affect a zone of several miles around the moored location			0
‘ for as we know , this floating tower will be the first floating object 100 per cent built and designed for flora and fauna			2
’ the firm said inspiration came from a project in @entity159 where ecologists asked them to provide habitats for animals which could n’t be disturbed by people			0
the cost for the @entity15 design is estimated at € 1 million ( £ 786,100 ) , and this would depend on water depth , mooring facilities and transport from construction site to the chosen city			2
further cost differences would depend on the preferred flora and fauna			0
@entity26 said it is in the process of finalising the location of the trees , and discussing costs with oil companies			0
once these are complete , they will start construction			0

the @entity15 concept was designed by @entity8 - based @entity26 to add high density , green spots to towns cities
floating structure would be built by offshore technology and be made up of layers in which flora and fauna could live
the towering green structures could also help reduce @entity227 emissions
to hold it in place , @entity26 claims @entity69 would be moored to the sea bed with a cable system
under the water , the @entity15 would also provide a habitat for small water creatures or artificial coral reefs
