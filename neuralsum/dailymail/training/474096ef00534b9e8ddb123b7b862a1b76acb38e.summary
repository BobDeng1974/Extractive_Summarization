by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 put the @entity3 on a collision course with @entity5 today as he promised to fight a ruling forcing @entity3 to give prisoners the vote			1
the prime minister insisted the decision was one for mps , not a ' foreign court ' , after human rights judges issued an ultimatum giving the government six months to change the law			1
@entity5 judges rode roughshod over @entity3 sovereignty yesterday by ruling that prisoners must be allowed to vote			2
in a devastating blow , they rejected last year 's overwhelming vote by mps for maintaining our historic blanket ban on voting by convicts			1
the unelected judges instead gave @entity2 until the end of the year to obey their diktat or risk having to pay £ 150million in compensation to killers , rapists and other prisoners			1
the @entity34 ruling will mean thousands of prisoners held in @entity3 jails will get voting rights but mr @entity2 told mps this afternoon he backed their overwhelming democratic vote last year that opposed the @entity42 ' ruling			1
at prime minister ’s questions , he said : ' i have always believed when you are sent to prison you lose certain rights and one of those rights is the right to vote			0
' crucially , i believe this should be a matter for @entity54 to decide , not a foreign court			1
' @entity54 has made its decision and i completely agree with it			2
' @entity57 @entity38 said today it created an unprecedented clash between the @entity42 in @entity60 and the @entity54			1
they demanded that mr @entity2 – who once said the thought of prisoners voting made him feel ' physically ill ' – should now ' take a stand for @entity3 's interests '			1
the battle risks sparking further demands for @entity3 to withdraw from the court , which has caused outrage with a string of controversial rulings on deporting foreign criminals and terror suspects			2
a leading constitutional expert said the issue at stake was whether the @entity3 remained in control of its own destiny or took orders from a remote foreign court			0
dr @entity80 , an ex-member of the @entity82 's own human rights commission , said : ' the principal issue is not whether prisoners are allowed to vote but whether the rules are set by a directly elected parliament or a group of @entity5 judges			1
' the @entity42 – whose judges do not even need to have any judicial experience in their homeland – first ruled in favour of @entity94 , a convicted axe killer demanding the right to vote , in 2004			0
the @entity82 may be forced to give the vote to prisoners , despite @entity2 saying the prospect of doing so made him ' physically ill ' rubbing it in : mr @entity94 , pictured in a @entity101 video in 2010 , toasted his apparent victory in his human rights case ' with champagne and a joint ' a string of appeals and legal cases followed before mps voted by an overwhelming majority of 234 to 22 last february to defy the court and maintain the ban , which has existed for more than 100 years			1
ministers hoped the strength of feeling would force @entity60 to think again , and lodged a fresh appeal to the @entity117 court 's @entity42			1
@entity118 , the attorney general , told the court that its judges should not be able to tell countries what to do on social questions			0
but yesterday the @entity42 upheld the original @entity94 verdict			0
officials are unaware of any further grounds for appeal			0
ruling : the decision will be seen as a victory for the likes of @entity94 , the convicted axe killer who was released from jail in 2004 and has been campaigning for prisoners to get the vote they now have six months to introduce legislation to give at least some prisoners the vote			2
the only consolation was that the @entity117 judges said it was up to the government to decide how best to obey its orders			2
one option previously considered by officials , to give the vote to convicts serving less than four years , would allow almost 30,000 to take part in elections			0
yesterday 's judgment suggested that a time limit of three years may be acceptable			0
this would still mean granting the vote to tens of thousands of inmates , in clear defiance of the express wishes of @entity54			1
backbench @entity57 mps , who led the parliamentary revolt last year , attacked the @entity42 's latest ruling and made it plain they will not give up the fight			1
ex-shadow home secretary @entity159 said : ' this regrettable decision is an infringement of the @entity3 @entity54 's right to decide on matters which are fundamental to the @entity3 way of life , and which are not appropriate to judicial intervention			1
' @entity167 , an mp and legal expert , said : ' @entity60 is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land			2
' @entity57 mp @entity174 said : ' the public will be demanding that the prime minister now stands up for @entity3 interests and refuses to give convicted prisoners the right to vote			0
' @entity5 's out - of - touch judges have also blocked the home secretary from deporting @entity182 and allowed dangerous foreign criminals to remain in the @entity3			2
' it is about time real changes are made to prevent them meddling in our laws again			0
' the ruling emerged a month after justice secretary @entity191 failed in his effort to secure major reform of @entity60 and give @entity3 more control over its affairs trampled on : the sovereign power of the @entity197 in @entity54 has been called into question after the @entity34 ruling dr @entity80 , now a legal expert at the @entity203 think tank , said : ' the judgment , while allowing some room for manoeuvre to the @entity3 over the issue , still puts the @entity60 court in direct conflict with the @entity210 which overwhelmingly voted earlier this year that prisoners should not be permitted to vote while they are incarcerated			1
' @entity213 will back @entity2 if he chooses to fight @entity5 on prisoners ’ voting rights , shadow chancellor @entity212 has said today			1
mr @entity212 said there was cross-party agreement about not giving the vote to prisoners and the ruling by the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) was the ' wrong thing			2
' ' i am all in favour of prisoners having the right kind of support and being rehabilitated but voting is one of the things i think you give up if you go to prison , ' he told @entity231			2
he added : ' if @entity2 is going to go out there and fight this one , we will be supporting him on that			1
' @entity213 repeatedly stalled over the implementation of the 2004 ruling , knowing it would be deeply unpopular with voters			0
@entity240 , @entity213 's shadow justice secretary , said : ' the original decision back in 2004 was wrong , and that 's why the @entity213 government did n't implement it , and we appealed again and again			0
' he added : ' on these kinds of issues , the @entity42 should give far more discretion to individual countries			0
this is an important reform that needs to be implemented			0
' ' @entity60 is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land			2
' @entity167 mp in 2010 , @entity2 told mps : ' it makes me physically ill to contemplate giving the vote to prisoners			1
' but he said the government reluctantly accepted there was a legal obligation to offer voting rights at least to some prisoners , or face possible compensation claims running into millions of pounds			1
at least 2,500 inmates have already lodged claims			0
yesterday 's @entity5 court judgment related to a test case involving @entity273 @entity272 , a convicted murderer who was demanding the right to vote			0
the @entity3 was made a party to the case as it has @entity5 - wide implications			0
the killer lost on the grounds that , unlike @entity3 , @entity273 does not have a blanket ban			0
last night a @entity282 spokesman said : ' this is a judgment affecting @entity273 , but clearly we need to consider the implications on the issue of prisoner voting for the @entity3			0
' the position for the @entity3 is that the attorney general has argued that the issue of social policy , including prisoner voting , is a matter for @entity54 and it is for @entity54 to judge whether and which prisoners should have the vote			1
' in an earlier version of this article we described mr @entity94 as an ' axe murderer '			0
he was convicted of manslaughter after killing a woman with an axe .			0

@entity256 's brand @entity60 ruling an ' infringement of @entity54 's rights '
@entity117 court states ban on prisoners voting violates human rights
ministers given six month *deadline* to amend rules or be forced to hand criminals thousands of pounds in compensation
@entity2 this afternoon pledges to fight the ruling
