published : 04:42 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 10:15 est , 20 may 2013 physicists may have created the smallest drops of liquid ever made in the lab. researchers using the @entity6 in @entity7 say they create droplets three to five protons in size - 100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one - 100,000,000th the size of a virus			1
the droplets are believed to be similar to a primordial matter that existed immediately following the @entity17 , the team say			1
the tiniest droplets : a reconstruction of the collision that produced collective flow behavior			1
the green lines are the trajectories of the sub-atomic particles produced by the collision reconstructed by the @entity27 tracking system			0
the red and blue bars represent the energy measured by the instrument 's two sets of calorimeters			0
( @entity33 ) this surprise result was achieved by firing proton ' bullets ' into lead ions , creating a subatomic blood spatter - like effect			2
evidence of the minuscule droplets was extracted from the results of colliding protons with lead ions at velocities approaching the speed of light			2
to provide a sense of scale , that is about one - 100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one - 100,000,000th the size of a virus			1
' with this discovery , we seem to be seeing the very origin of collective behavior , ' said @entity58 , professor of physics at @entity60 who led the study			0
' regardless of the material that we are using , collisions have to be violent enough to produce about 50 sub-atomic particles before we begin to see collective , flow - like behavior			2
' a big machine for a tiny droplet : part of the @entity27 experiment being moved into place			0
it contains the world 's most powerful superconducting magnet , generating a field 100,000 times that of the @entity76 with enough energy to melt 18 tons of gold			2
these tiny droplets ' flow ' in a manner similar to the behavior of the quark - gluon plasma , a state of matter that is a mixture of the sub-atomic particles that makes up protons and neutrons and only exists at extreme temperatures and densities - and many believe the entire universe once consisted of this strongly interacting elixir for fractions of a second after the @entity17 when conditions were dramatically hotter and denser than they are today			1
now that the universe has spent billions of years expanding and cooling , the only way scientists can reproduce this primordial plasma is to bang atomic nuclei together with tremendous energy			1
in what was supposed to be a control run to check the validity of their lead - lead results , the scientists scheduled the collider to smash protons and lead nuclei together			0
they did n’t expect to see any evidence of the plasma			0
@entity58 , centre , in a room set up with telecommunications equipment that allows them to monitor of the detector 's performance and directly download data because the protons are so much lighter than lead nuclei ( they have only one - 208th the mass ) , it was generally agreed that proton - lead collisions could n’t release enough energy to produce the rare state of matter			1
' the proton - lead collisions are something like shooting a bullet through an apple while lead - lead collisions are more like smashing two apples together : a lot more energy is released in the latter , ' said @entity58			0
after analyzing several billion events , they found hundreds of cases where the collisions produced more than 300 particles flowing together .			0

team *recreated* the world ’s tiniest droplets of a primordial state of matter they believe last existed moments after the @entity17 , some 13.82 billion years *ago*
drop is one - 100,000th the size of a hydrogen atom or one - 100,000,000th the size of a virus
