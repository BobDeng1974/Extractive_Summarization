generous donation : cosmetics tycoon @entity0 , left , has donated 78 @entity3 works to @entity5 's @entity4 , including @entity12 's @entity25 ( @entity26 ) ' , right exhibition : the works , regarded as one of the foremost collections of @entity3 art in the world , will go on display at the museum ( pictured ) next year the collection , which will go on display at the museum in 2014 , includes 33 works by @entity12 , 17 by @entity13 , and 14 each from @entity14 and @entity39			1
some of its most esteemed pieces include @entity12 's @entity42 from 1912 , @entity43 in an armchair from 1913 and @entity13 's trees at @entity46 from 1908			1
mr @entity19 , director of the museum , said : ' @entity0 's gift is truly transformational for the @entity4			0
' although the @entity4 is unique in its ability to exhibit over 5,000 years of art history , we have long lacked this critical dimension in the story of modernism			0
iconic : among the 78 works donated by mr @entity0 is @entity13 's 1908 ' arbres a @entity56 ( trees at @entity58 ) ' , pictured left , and @entity39 's 1914 ' @entity59 ( @entity60 ) ' , right ' now , @entity61 will be represented with some of its greatest masterpieces , demonstrating both its role as the groundbreaking movement of the 20th century and the foundation for an artistic dialogue that continues today			1
' this is an extraordinary gift to our museum and our @entity70			0
' mr @entity0 said of his donation in a statement : ' this is a gift to the people who live and work in @entity5 and those from around the world who come to visit our great arts institutions			1
' the arts are a cornerstone of the cultural , educational , and economic vitality of the @entity70			0
' i selected the @entity4 as the way to share this collection because i feel that it ’s essential that @entity61 — and the art that follows it , for that matter — be seen and studied within the collections of one of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world			2
' the @entity4 ’s collection of modernism , together with those of @entity97 , the @entity98 , and the @entity99 , reinforce the @entity70 ’s standing as the center for 20th century art and fuel @entity5 ’s ongoing role as the art capital of the world			1
' mr @entity0 , who is worth an estimated $ 7.9billion , began his collection in 1976 and made his most recent purchase - a @entity14 collage - only last month			1
he has pledged to continue to add to the museum 's collection by buying additional works			1
influential : @entity12 is pictured in the 1960s @entity61 was the most influential art movement of the 20th century : it radically destroyed traditional illusionism in painting , revolutionized the way we see the world ( as @entity14 said ) , and paved the way for the pure abstraction that dominated @entity122 art for the next 50 years			1
led by @entity12 and @entity13 , the @entity3 dismantled traditional perspective and modeling in the round in order to emphasize the two - dimensional picture plane			2
@entity3 collage introduced fragments of mass - produced popular culture into pictures , thereby changing the very definition of art. more than half of the @entity135 focuses on the six - year period , 1909 - 14 , during which @entity13 and @entity12 - the two founders of the @entity3 movement - closely collaborated			2
their partnership began in earnest in the fall of 1908 , when the visionary dealer @entity143 exhibited @entity13 ’s most recent paintings in his @entity146 gallery			0
@entity147 is known to have disparaged @entity13 ’s pictures as ' painting made of small cubes ' and the term @entity61 first appeared in print in @entity154 ’s review of the @entity143 exhibition			0
the @entity135 includes two landscapes from this historic show : terrace at the @entity158 , @entity159 ( 1907 ) , which marks @entity13 ’s transition from @entity161 to @entity61 , and the iconic trees at @entity163 ( 1908 ) , which inaugurates @entity61			2
by 1909 , @entity13 and @entity12 were inseparable			2
as @entity12 later recounted : ' almost every evening , either i went to @entity13 ’s studio or he came to mine			0
famous : @entity12 's @entity167 with a cake ' each of us had to see what the other had done during the day			1
' we criticized each other ’s work			0
a canvas was n’t finished until both of us felt it was			0
' a pair of identically sized paintings from 1911 the @entity183 ’s @entity178 and @entity12 ’s @entity179 with wine glasses , @entity181 , and @entity182 - exemplify a pivotal moment in the history of @entity61 when the two artists began to picture objects from different points of view in an increasingly shallow space			0
only a few clues were retained to help viewers decode the picture , the profile of an instrument or the tassel of a curtain			0
as the works hovered on the brink of illegibility , @entity13 and @entity12 began to introduce ' certainties ' , as @entity13 called them : painted letters and words and , soon after , actual pieces of rope , newspaper , sheet music , and brand labels			1
they inspired other artists to incorporate all kinds of unorthodox materials into works of art. source : @entity4			0
