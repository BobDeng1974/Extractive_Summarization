prepared : sir @entity0 with his rifle and @entity2 , his hunting companion you can probably tell from the intrepid get - up and the rifle at his side , but sir @entity0 is a man on a mission – a mission to protect the public from a big cat that he says is stalking his estate			1
he ’d also rather like to mount its head on one of the walls in his 13th century manor house			2
the eccentric aristocrat fears the puma - like creature will kill a visitor if it is not shot dead and has put up signs around his 98 - acre estate in @entity25 , warning ramblers to be on the lookout			1
following numerous sightings , a staff member managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone			2
sir @entity0 , 67 , who has named the cat @entity35 of @entity36 after the village nearest his estate , said : ‘ i think it is bigger than most cats , probably bigger than a puma			1
‘ when i saw the photo , it was visibly huge			2
the grass in the picture is two - and - a - half foot high			1
‘ we need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog			2
‘ @entity52 , i need the head to put in my collection			2
’ @entity55 , 25 , the staff member who snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at @entity58 , said : ‘ i saw something about 150 metres away and did n’t know if it was a deer , but it looked strange			1
i zoomed in and took the images			0
‘ it certainly looks like a big cat			0
i have no other explanation for it			0
’ and he might just be right			0
there have been a ‘ substantial ’ number of sightings of big cats in @entity25 in the last year , according to @entity71 , founder of the @entity72			0
sir @entity0 claims to have seen the creature before , lurking behind a postbox , and in recent months , he and members of staff have found piles of feathers around the estate , as well as the remains of a dead fox			1
mysterious : what appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by sir @entity0 at @entity58 , @entity25 taking action : sir @entity0 has put up a sign saying ' beware of the big cat ' at his grand estate @entity58 , near @entity89 in @entity25 he also fears the creature is feeling particularly defensive after visitors said they spotted cubs			1
the baronet added : ‘ i ’ve put up signs to warn people and people have been keeping their dogs in their cars and have n’t let their children walk off in case they do n’t come back			2
' i have a wedding business to run here too			0
luckily the guests make a bit of noise so this creature hopefully wo n’t come near			0
but they might get gobbled up if they wander off			0
’ however , sir @entity0 conceded that mr @entity55 ’s photo is not conclusive			1
warning : sir @entity0 is warning guests at his @entity58 to be careful following the big cat sighting ‘ they do n’t exactly stand still and pose , which is the problem , ’ he said			1
he said he planned to collect hair and droppings to send off for analysis the next time animal remains are found			0
sir @entity0 , a childless millionaire , made headlines last year after police staged a dramatic raid on his home , which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured			1
he said he used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window			0
rival : in 2008 @entity129 spotted this big black cat outside her holiday home and believes it may have been the legendary @entity35 of @entity134			0

sir @entity0 says the ' @entity136 ' has been on his land
animals have been killed at 98 - acre @entity58 and warning signs are up
