' i 'm not being critical to our other former players , but @entity3 was one of the few who put something back into the club when he finished playing			1
' he would turn up to watch and sell tickets for the club draw			0

‘ a farmer who was out in his tractor came to his aid and had offered to tow him out but despite his best efforts and the first responder locally and the air ambulance mr @entity3 could n’t be revived			1
‘ he was @entity17 born and bred and had had a delivery round in and around the town for 25 years so he knew an awful lot of people and they knew him even if only by sight travelling around the lanes			2
’ picturesque : a winter scene at the weekend on @entity9 as a 4x4 vehicle passes near @entity117 , @entity18 a local @entity119 source said : ‘ i think the road was blocked by a fallen tree and mr @entity3 was trying to get round it when he got stuck in a drift			1

we are awaiting the results of a post mortem and for the body to be released			0
‘ until then we wo n’t know what the precise cause of death was			0
we are assuming it was probably some sort of heart attack but we are not sure and we really do n’t know if it was due to the circumstances he found himself in with his van			0
‘ @entity3 was stuck in the snow and had been digging around but the farmer who went to his aid did n’t report him being red faced and sweating or puffing and panting or anything like that			1
‘ he offered to pull @entity160 out after he had only been digging for a short while but before he could climb back into the driver ’s seat to be towed out he just slid down the wing of the car and onto the ground			0
