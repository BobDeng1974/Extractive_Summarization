published : 08:17 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 6 june 2013 depriving yourself of your favourite things can make you obsessed with them , according to a new study			2
researchers found that by forbidding a pleasure - such as a bar of chocolate - it heightened the brain ’s awareness of it			1
but they also found that people did not become fixated if they knew that other people were not able to enjoy their favourite thing			1
envious : the more we forbid an object - such as a specific food - the more our brain becomes focussed on it			2
lead author @entity20 of the @entity21 said : ‘ our findings show that when individuals are forbidden from everyday objects , our minds and brains pay more attention to them			2
‘ our brains give forbidden objects the same level of attention as our own personal possessions			2
’ the study 's most important finding , though , is that obsession is not as strong if others are also denied : when an object is forbidden to a group , the allure of the object reduces dramatically			1
scientists say that this helps to explain why group diet techniques such as @entity44 can be more successful than dieting alone			1
temptation : scientists have discovered why dieting is so difficult it also offers important insights for compulsive hoarding and parents seeking to help their children 's attachment to toys and other possessions			0
for the study , entitled an unforgettable apple : memory and attention for forbidden objects , participants were shown images of everyday objects and told the objects were either theirs , someone else 's , forbidden to them or forbidden to everyone			0
using electronic brain imaging and memory tests , researchers found the forbidden objects were recognised as well as self - owned objects			1
this was interpreted as a sign of unnecessary heightened concentration			0
‘ since the days of @entity78 and the apple , scholars have been interested in [ mankind 's ] attraction to items we should avoid , ’ says professor @entity74 who also took part in the study			0
‘ today , it is things like jumbo soft drinks , fatty foods and illicit substances			0
‘ these new findings help to explain how our brain processes forbidden objects and suggests that , for resisting temptation , there 's strength in numbers			1
it 's harder to go it alone			0
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0

@entity107 *experts* found that the more we try to ignore an object , the more our brain concentrates on it
but people are less obsessed with a forbidden item if they know that others ca *n't* *indulge* too
researchers say this could explain why group diets such as @entity44 are so successful
