at school we 're taught that @entity3 's tectonic plates are rigid and fit together like pieces in a puzzle			1
but it turns out that this theory may be wrong			0
a study has suggested that the plates that make up @entity3 's outer layer are deformed by temperature changes and that they are in fact ' bendy ' , not stiff			1
a study by @entity16 scientists suggests @entity3 's tectonic plates ( shown ) are malleable			1
they say that the plates can cool and change in size and shape			1
this means they contract faster in certain sections and deform			1
during this process earthquakes within the plate can form the study , supported by the @entity27 , was carried out by dr @entity28 at the @entity29 and his colleague dr @entity30 of @entity31			1
their idea is that plate cooling , which makes the oceans deeper , also affects horizontal movement and that there is shortening and deformation of the plates due to the cooling			0
in their study they focused on data from the @entity45 plate and found that different parts of it were moving at different rates			0
they found that the cooling of the lithosphere , the outermost layer of @entity3 , makes some sections of the @entity45 plate contract horizontally at faster rates than other sections , which causes the plate to deform			1
@entity3 has a unique network of shifting plates embedded in its cold and rocky outermost layer , the lithosphere			2
the motion of these plates drives many @entity3 processes , including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , while also stabilizing the planet ’s climate and enabling life			2
the division of the @entity3 ’s surface into plates , separated by linear zones of concentrated deformation , is a defining characteristic of our planet , and unique among known terrestrial bodies			2
they say that the deformation could explain why some parts of the plate tectonic puzzle do n't make sense			2
for example they showed that there is a positive correlation between where the plate is predicted to deform and where intraplate earthquakes - ones inside a tectonic plate rather than two rubbing together - occur			2
the formation of intraplate earthquakes has been somewhat of a mystery until now			0
' this is plate tectonics 2.0 , it revolutionises the concepts of plate rigidity , ' said dr @entity28			1
' we have shown that the @entity45 plate deforms , that it is pliable			0
we are refining the plate tectonic theory and have come up with an explanation for mid-plate seismicity			0
' according to the researchers plate cooling , which makes the oceans deeper , also affects horizontal movement and that there is shortening and deformation of the plates due to cooling			0
pictured is the @entity114 in @entity115 , the most strikingly graphic portion of the @entity117 dr @entity28 , associate professor in the @entity118 at the @entity29 , @entity119 , conducts research on plate tectonics and geodetics			1
his latest research shows that oceanic tectonic plates deform due to cooling			1
' this is plate tectonics 2.0 ' he said the oceanic plates are thought to be shortening due to cooling , which causes relative motion inside the plate , dr @entity28 said			1
the oceanic crust of the @entity130 off the coast of @entity115 is moving 0.08 inches ( two millimetres ) to the south every year relative to the @entity45 and @entity136 plate boundary			0
' it may not sound like much , but it is significant considering that we can measure crustal motion with @entity141 within a fraction of a millimeter per year , ' he said			0
' unfortunately , all existing gps stations on pacific islands are in the old part of the plate that is not expected nor shown to deform			0
' new measurements will be needed within the young parts of the plate to confirm this study 's predictions , either on very remote islands or through sensors on the ocean floor			0
' to reach their conclusion they used large - scale numerical modeling as well as gps velocities from the largest gps data - processing center in the world - the @entity160 at the @entity29 , @entity119 .			0

study by @entity16 scientists suggests @entity3 's tectonic plates are malleable
they say that the plates can cool and change in size and shape
this means they contract faster in certain sections and deform
it could explain how earthquakes within a plate can form
