by @entity1 reporter published : 04:03 est , 28 june 2013 updated : 04:13 est , 28 june 2013 dinosaurs once crawled on all fours like human children before switching to two feet as they reached adolescence , experts have discovered			2
analysis of bones 100 million years old showed baby @entity9 had long arms and short legs , which were used to scuttle around shortly after hatching			1
the arms grew quickly between the ages of one and three , suggesting that the @entity9 continued to move on all fours during their ‘ toddler ’ years			1
@entity17 crawled on all fours like toddlers before switching to two feet when they grew up , experts have discovered but aged four , @entity9 - known as the ‘ parrot dinosaur ’ - experienced a massive growth spurt in their legs , while the development of their arms slowed			1
this meant legs grew to twice the size of arms - causing the dinosaurs to spend their adult life on two feet			1
palaeontologists from @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 discovered the differences in limb growth through a combination of biomechanical analysis and bone histology			1
@entity45 , from the @entity44 in @entity36 , carried out the intricate study on bones of babies , juveniles and adults			1
analysis of bones 100 million years old showed baby @entity9 had long arms and short legs , which were used to scuttle around shortly after hatching dr @entity45 , who conducted the research as part of his phd thesis at the @entity57 , said : ' some of the bones from @entity9 were only a few millimetres across , so i had to handle them extremely carefully to be able to make useful bone sections			1
' i also had to be sure to cause as little damage to these valuable specimens as possible			0
' there are more than 1,000 specimens of @entity9 from the @entity67 period of @entity68 and other parts of east @entity70 , around 100 million years ago			1
a ' cold snap ' that made the dinosaurs shiver 116 million years ago caused a crisis in the oceans similar to the effects of global warming			0
the 2.5 million - year cooling period led to the disruption of populations of small plants and animals that form the foundation of marine ecosystems			0
for most of the @entity67 period , which marked the height of the dinosaurs ' reign , the @entity84 was a ' hothouse ' with temperatures around @entity91 higher than they are today			0
but scientists confirmed that right in the middle of the @entity67 average global temperatures plunged by up to @entity95			0
analysis of an ocean floor sediment core taken from the @entity98 showed how the change led to a major shift in the global carbon cycle			0
it coincided with the decline of some groups of marine plankton and extinctions of surface - dwelling micro-organisms			0
at the same time , the abundance of certain cold - water organisms increased			0
dr @entity45 sought special permission from the @entity111 to section two arm and two leg bones from 16 individual dinosaurs , aged from less than one year to 10 years old , or fully grown			2
he carried out intricate sectioning work in a special palaeohistology laboratory in @entity38 in @entity118			2
the one - year - olds had long arms and short legs and scuttled about on all fours soon after hatching			1
bone sections showed that the arm bones grew fastest when the dinosaurs were aged between one and three			2
from four to six years , arm growth slowed down and the leg bones showed a massive growth spurt , meaning they ended up twice as long as the arms			1
professor @entity132 of the @entity111 , who supervised dr @entity45 ’s thesis , said : ' this remarkable study , the first of its kind , shows how much information is locked in the bones of dinosaurs			0
' we are delighted the study worked so well , and see many ways to use the new methods to understand even more about the astonishing lives of the dinosaurs			0
' professor @entity147 , of the @entity57 , who also supervised dr @entity45 ’s phd , said : ' these kinds of studies can also throw light on the evolution of a dinosaur like @entity9			2
' having four - legged babies and juveniles suggests that at some time in their ancestry , both juveniles and adults were also four - legged , and @entity9 and dinosaurs in general became secondarily bipedal			2
' the research is published in the journal @entity162 .			0

@entity9 had long arms and short legs , and scuttled around
their arms grew quickly between the ages of one and three , suggesting they continued to move on all fours during their ‘ toddler ’ years
they then experienced a massive growth spurt at age four
scientists from @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 studied bones *100million* years old
