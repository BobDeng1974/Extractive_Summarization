after five years with the @entity13 , @entity7 has been exiled to the @entity15 countryside where she will live with a member of mr @entity5 ’s staff			1
@entity5 has banished his tabby cat @entity7 ( pictured ) from @entity8 after she lost out in the battle for his affections to a @entity11 called @entity12 @entity7 has been exiled to the @entity15 countryside where she will live with a member of mr @entity5 ’s staff to appease the chancellor ’s two children , @entity22 , 13 , and @entity23 , 11 , her new owner has agreed to send them regular photographs and updates about the cat			1
the official explanation is that the move is for @entity7 ’s own safety : it comes just weeks after she was hit by a car near @entity8			1
the mog has also made headlines for her worrying tendency to stray			0
but other sources claim it was simple favouritism - mr @entity5 is more of a dog man , and @entity7 was felt to have been ‘ bullying ’ @entity12 , who is half her size			1
when the chancellor first brought @entity12 back to the flat above no 10 where he lives , in 2011 , @entity7 was already firmly ensconsed			1
although each pet had the run of their own floor of the apartment , when they met on the stairs the mood was said to have been ‘ frosty ’			0
@entity12 soon cemented her place in the government by getting ‘ married ’ to chief whip @entity53 ’s male @entity11 , @entity54 , in a flower - strewn ceremony			2
mr @entity5 has been gushing about @entity12 , who he devotedly takes for loo breaks in the @entity8 garden at 6am and midnight			1
mr @entity5 has been gushing about @entity12 ( pictured ) , who he devotedly takes for loo breaks in the @entity8 garden only yesterday he told an interviewer that he thought @entity12 was ‘ much prettier ’ than mr @entity53 ’s dog			1
he did n’t mention @entity7			0
last night , a @entity8 source told @entity62 : ‘ @entity7 had to go , it just was n’t working out			2
@entity12 was scared of her			0
’ however , an aide to the chancellor was at pains to deny that @entity7 had been intimidating the dog			2
‘ the issue was her tendency to roam , not her relations with @entity12 , ’ he said			0
‘ she has ended up all over the place : @entity73 , the @entity75 pub [ on @entity76 ] and miles south of the river			0
‘ it was getting too much and it was only a matter of time before she was seriously hurt			0
’ @entity7 ’s temperament was first questioned when she was seen fighting with @entity81 ’s cat , @entity82 , on the @entity8 pavement			1
this summer , the tabby had to be treated by vets after being hit by a car			2
her injuries were minor , but it confirmed the chancellor ’s growing view that the @entity13 should become a one - pet family			0
@entity7 went missing from mr @entity5 ’s @entity93 home in 2009 and , after the family moved to @entity8 , she strayed more frequently , once travelling more than a mile to @entity95 , where she was rescued by a charity worker			1
last night , a @entity98 aide said : ‘ the car accident could have been fatal , and as a result the family took the view that she was at too much risk living in @entity8			0
’ @entity7 ’s departure leaves @entity82 , who lives with the @entity104 above no 11 , as the last feline in residence in @entity8			2
the most famous @entity108 cat was @entity109 , who was adopted in 1989 as a stray while @entity111 was prime minister			0
when @entity113 moved in , officials were forced to organise a photocall to disprove rumours the cat had been put down by wife @entity117 .			0
