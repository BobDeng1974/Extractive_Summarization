by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 seven - one			0
alright , it was not the greatest surprise of all time that @entity5 beat @entity6 , who had been surviving on the oxygen of public euphoria			2
but seven - one ? @entity6 , the emergent economic nation , may not recover from this			2
devastation : a tearful @entity12 is comforted by @entity13 after the result that shook @entity6 shock : the @entity6 back four can not believe it as they concede the sixth goal during a terrible display never mind @entity20 @entity19 and his devastated football team who , in the emotion of losing their @entity24 prodigy , played with their suicidal hearts instead of their heads against the @entity30 ice - machine			1
and what about our fantasies ? @entity6 were the beautiful dream			2
@entity6 in @entity35 1970 were the most beautiful team			0
yet once again this otherwise little - known city is the graveyard of football dreams			0
glum : @entity6 fans can not believe their eyes as @entity5 record the unbelievable result against the hosts delight : @entity30 fans in @entity37 could scarcely contain their joy as their team performed magnificently this one was the most astonishing because of the margin			1
sometimes the great upset involves two major nations in a match for which one was such a huge , in - form favourite that triumph seemed inevitable			0
here are the @entity59 ’s mind - blowing seven : 1 ) @entity6 1 @entity5 7 2014 never mind the result			1
measure the score - line in @entity37			2
hundreds of thousands of electronically shocked twitterers			0
two - hundred million traumatised believers			0
in tatters : @entity19 gesticulates as his team are dispatched and his reputation dismantled eleven samba footballers , plus subs , who will never play the same again			0
2 ) @entity70 1 @entity69 0 1950 the curse of @entity37 strikes for the first time , an @entity69 team replete with famous names , who make them @entity59 favourites , rest @entity77 for the serious tests to come and are knocked out by @entity80 , whose day - job is as a dishwasher in a fast food restaurant			1
toppled : @entity80 scores past @entity84 as @entity69 's stars were knocked out by minnows @entity70 video @entity87 remembers 1950 heartbreak 3 ) @entity5 3 , @entity90 2 1954 the @entity91 of @entity92 , the brilliantly nick - named @entity93 , had stormed @entity94 with a transforming 6 - 3 win and thrashed @entity69 7 - 1 in @entity96 in a 32 - match unbeaten run en route to the @entity100 in @entity101			1
they had also crushed the @entity103 8 - 3 in the group stages of that tournament			0
@entity92 and @entity106 each scored to put @entity90 two - up inside ten minutes			0
@entity91 : @entity90 , led by @entity92 ( above ) had been thrashed @entity5 in the group stage @entity109 : @entity110 scored @entity5 ' first goal as they came from behind to win the trophy 4 ) @entity114 1 @entity115 0 1966 @entity115 were to suffer another calamity in @entity117 42 years later but the @entity118 had not been thought of as a threat at this time and @entity122 ’s goal sent the @entity123 home to double the barrage of rotten tomatoes which is always their lot when they return from a @entity59 disaster			1
contest : @entity115 turned up to the @entity130 expected to ease past @entity114 but the @entity131 defended well shock : four @entity131 defenders battle with @entity134 as @entity115 's high - profile side were beaten 5 ) @entity136 1 @entity137 0 1990 @entity138 ’s @entity137 went to @entity115 as @entity59 favourites only to lose the opening game of that defence to @entity143 ’s lone goal for basically the first of the emergent @entity145 , who were red - carded down to nine men by the finish but held on			1
towering : @entity148 scores the only goal of the game as holders @entity137 lose to @entity136 upset : @entity143 celebrates the surprise goal but @entity137 still managed to reach the @entity59 final unbelievable : the @entity136 players celebrate their win , as surprised as anyone at their achievement still @entity138 carried @entity137 to a losing final against the @entity30 , on the @entity159 and one leg			2
6 ) @entity161 1 @entity162 5 2014 @entity164 ’s defending @entity59 holders have escaped relatively unscathed for being slaughtered by the @entity165 and eliminated within their first two matches of @entity6 2014 , not least because their catasrophe has been overshadowed by @entity6 1 @entity30 7			1
turning point : @entity170 's flying header put @entity162 level after @entity161 had taken the lead high five : @entity175 's side produced a stunning display to beat the @entity177 but @entity180 ’s @entity179 header dramatically signalled the end of @entity183 supremacy , as well as football ’s tiki - taka era			1
7 ) @entity186 0 @entity187 1 2002 @entity186 of @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 opened the defence of their only @entity59 – won in @entity195 four years earlier - by losing to a goal made by @entity197 for @entity198			1
stars struck : papa @entity201 scores from close range as the likes of @entity191 and @entity192 look on competition : @entity186 's stars were out - fought by a team of then - unknown @entity187 players the champions went out in the group stages .			0

@entity5 thrashing hosts @entity6 7 - 1 the most shocking @entity59 result
curse of @entity37 strikes again
@entity69 lost to minnows @entity70 in same @entity217 in 1950
@entity5 win eclipses @entity162 's 5 - 1 win over @entity161 as biggest @entity222 shock
