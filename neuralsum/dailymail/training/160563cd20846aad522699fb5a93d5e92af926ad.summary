socialite @entity0 is a home - loving girl , and so she should be , when that home contains 57 rooms , is worth an estimated £ 70 million , and stands on the most expensive street in @entity6			1
@entity0 , the eldest daughter of @entity8 chief @entity7 , has lived in the house with her husband , @entity11 , and their five - month - old daughter , @entity12 , for a year			1
the incredible house - built in the early 1900s - has four storeys above ground and two below and its value has almost doubled since the two - year renovation project she masterminded with @entity6 - born but @entity22 - based designer @entity21 was finished in 2013			1
' the minute i walked in , i knew it would be a wonderful family home			1
it had a great energy			2
i felt it could be a home for life			2
' that home for life idea was cemented when @entity12 was born			2
understandably , @entity0 dotes on her beautiful daughter : ' when i was pregnant i said to @entity11 i was going to breastfeed the baby for maybe two months at the most and then switch to formula milk			2
my sister breastfed for 14 months and i said , ' no way , @entity44 , they have teeth ! ' @entity0 's grade ii * - listed house stands on @entity6 's most expensive street , @entity49 , where her neighbours include ambassadors and just across the road the @entity53 and @entity54 the artwork above the fireplace is a @entity58 original and was a wedding present from @entity0 's younger sister @entity60 ' now i want to breast - feed her for ever			1
she 's had no formula and if i have to give her a bottle of milk that i pumped and i ca n't do it myself i have an emotional breakdown			2
i 'm that mum stuck in traffic coming home from work and ringing my nanny begging her not to feed @entity12 so i can do it when i get home			1
' since the baby 's birth the family make the most use of just three rooms			0
' we seem to live in three rooms at most : the kitchen , where i make breakfast – that 's my forte ; the sitting room , to relax and watch tv ; and our bedroom where @entity12 also has her cot			0
' of her husband she says : ' he has his opinions and tells me if i 'm wrong or stupid			0
i get an honest answer			0
he 's a great dad and a good husband and my best friend			0
he works in property , finding it , renovating and selling it on			0
and it 's important to me that my dad really gets on with him			0
' with a contented marriage and a beautiful daughter , life is good for 30 - year - old @entity0 who has recently launched a brand of hair - care products called @entity104 that 's sold in @entity105 and @entity106 as well as @entity107 and @entity108			0
that and her charity work keep her busy , busy , busy			1
@entity0 and her husband @entity11 prefer staying at home and having a few friends round for drinks in the garden ( above ) or to watch the football or @entity8 in their basement cinema room the family can relax by the indoor pool or the hot tub next to it			0
backlit onyx enlivens the room despite living in a 57 - room mansion , @entity0 and her husband and daughter seem to spend their time in just three rooms : the kitchen , the sitting room and the bedroom where @entity12 also has a cot the @entity133 like to have friends over for dinner ; this remarkable dining room seats 12 the formal living room in the house - just one of its 57 rooms - where @entity0 and her husband entertain the lobby where guests sign the visitors ' book on the right of the table as they enter the magnificent house			1
