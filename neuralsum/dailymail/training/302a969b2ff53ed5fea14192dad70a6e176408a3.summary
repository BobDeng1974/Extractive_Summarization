my morning walk along the @entity2 on sunday took me past a moored boat with the owner reading his paper			2
‘ we will be right for the @entity8 , ’ he shouted up			2
his wry comment sums up the type of thinking that has permeated @entity13 ’s fans , players and coaching staff			1
it should n’t be like this			2
let ’s hear no talk about 2019 in the next 10 months from anyone within the @entity13 camp			1
this team have lost five matches in a row and need to get back to winning ways , starting with @entity26 on saturday			1
a large chunk of this squad will not even make it through to 2019 and this endless talk of development , learning , number of caps and the future is disrespectful to them			2
it is also disrespectful to the fans who pay a lot of money to go to @entity41			2
they want to see results , not a development exercise			2
video @entity45 reviewing @entity13 's performance against @entity48 @entity13 captain @entity49 looked devastated after the final whistle as @entity13 were beaten again @entity13 coach @entity45 must focus on the here and now and get back to winning ways @entity13 have just 10 games to get it right before their opening @entity8 2015 fixture against @entity57 on september 18			1
autumn internationals nov 22 @entity13 v @entity41 nov 29 @entity13 v @entity60 @entity61 2015 feb 6 @entity62 v @entity13 @entity63 feb 14 @entity13 v @entity64 mar 1 @entity67 v @entity68 mar 14 @entity13 v @entity69 @entity41 mar 21 @entity13 v @entity71 @entity41 @entity8 warm - ups 2015 aug 15 @entity13 v @entity71 @entity41 aug 22 @entity71 v @entity74 sept 5 @entity13 v @entity67 @entity60 their one chance at @entity8 glory is 2015 , that is their @entity78 and it should be everyone ’s			1
the way you get there is by making every match from now a knockout game			2
@entity13 can absolutely win the @entity85 , i know they can based on the talent they have available , but they have got to start being deadly serious and ruthless , and it starts with @entity26 and not @entity89			1
some will say that four of the five defeats were to @entity91 but if anyone at @entity41 thinks like that , they are in the wrong place			2
i agree with @entity45 that now is not the time to panic but i totally disagree with suggestions that @entity13 might use the @entity26 game to experiment and to give starts to some of the reserves and bench players in the squad			1
we do not have that luxury any more			0
doing that encourages totally the wrong mindset			0
what @entity13 need to do is approach saturday ’s game like any other test and pick their strongest team			1
they need to unequivocally decide what that xv is and produce a superlative performance against @entity26 to instil confidence and momentum			1
this will give the team the maximum chance of facing @entity89 with the right mindset and finishing the autumn internationals on a high			0
@entity48 came out on top 31 - 28 at @entity41 on saturday to inflict another defeat on @entity13 that first - choice xv will definitely involve changes because the team defeated by @entity48 was not right , especially behind the scrum			1
but if now is not the time for wholesale changes , it is crunch time			0
i would love to see @entity136 make a really bold decision to set the scene and get some excitement in the team , do something to show that @entity13 mean business and that the last two performances are not acceptable			1
@entity136 needs to make it clear that he is picking his best team because it then spells out to players who are not included that they have been dropped , not rested			0
this is not the time for niceties , it ’s time players are told that they are not performing at their best and somebody else is now rated above them			0
no player can think his is an automatic selection			0
i only ever told @entity156 or @entity157 they were my captain for one game at a time because they had to earn their place			0
i had a decent contract with the @entity164 but i knew i could be sacked if i had three or four bad results			0
@entity13 's dominance in the first quarter against @entity91 still saw them come up short a spell of pressure for @entity91 saw @entity171 gather the ball and score for the @entity91 the moment players think they are part of a long - term strategy , they consider themselves young players who do n’t have to win every game			1
that attitude seeps into you and it is wrong			0
they should instead remember the old adage : you ’re only as good as your last game			0
i dropped @entity157 for what would have been his 50th cap			0
we had beaten @entity91 but i left him out of the next match against @entity89 because i thought @entity190 was a better option			2
i had to do what was best for the team but he still talks about it now ! with regards to this team , the half - backs need to change , with @entity199 and @entity200 replaced by @entity201 and @entity202			1
i would still pick @entity203 but he is not even in the squad so clearly this will not happen			0
i would have liked to see @entity200 at 12 but the chance has gone because he is out of form			0
so @entity13 must find a ball - player at 12			1
@entity13 went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive @entity91 team @entity213 's indiscipline cost @entity13 on saturday and he could make way at hooker i have no idea what @entity13 ’s thinking at centre is at the moment , what their pecking order is , but if they decide to bring in @entity225 it must be spelled out to whoever makes way that he has been dropped			1
@entity228 will know he did n’t have the best game but we need some more pace in the back row to supplement the excellent work of the front five			2
@entity235 can bring that pace and would take to the field like a man possessed , knowing the jersey is up for grabs			1
@entity240 had a brilliant spell when he came on but can he play the full 80 minutes ? if not , do not pick him			0
i was disappointed by @entity213 ’s lack of discipline with his yellow card on saturday which marred some good line - out throwing this autumn			2
so if @entity13 decide to start with @entity248 , it should be because they think he is the best man for the job , not because he needs a run - out			1
the same applies if @entity235 comes into the back row			1
@entity13 lost 24 - 21 against @entity91 at a rain - soaked @entity41 after an impressive second half from the @entity91 on saturday @entity45 has got to be completely blinkered now in his approach to every game			1
watching @entity89 coach @entity257 ahead of the @entity71 match was fascinating			1
he was so animated , standing in the middle of his players			0
but his job , like any international coach is very simple : coach and select the team and let nothing and nobody distract you			2
just win the next game			0
it is a very straightforward job description			0
instead , @entity13 seem to be complicating things			1
the visit of 400metres legend @entity271 to @entity272 last week raised a few eyebrows			0
in a summer fitness camp or an early season , that ’s ok and has value and there is no one better than @entity156 , who is a brilliant individual			0
but right in the middle of one of the most important weeks of the season before a must - win game against a team you have n’t beaten in the last 11 attempts ? no way			0
i would prefer to think the @entity13 camp is an aggressive , hostile , uncompromising environment right now with some tough meetings being held			1
@entity202 should replace @entity200 at fly half because the latter is suffering for form @entity200 has struggled for form and should make way at fly half for the match against @entity26 when a squad is properly in the zone some pretty harsh words can be spoken in training in the week before these huge internationals and it can all kick off behind closed doors			1
that ’s a good thing as all top teams need some sulphur in the air at times			0
it ’s not very nice sometimes but that is what true high - performance environments are like			0
it ’s what happens when big characters are all straining at the leash trying to make something great happen for @entity13			1
but that is never going to occur when you have celebrities or @entity321 to contend with			0
every meeting and every session must be held in private			0
@entity13 are trying to tick boxes that do n’t need ticking			1
there is a danger of trying to be friends with everybody			0
too much attention is going into stuff that just does n’t matter in terms of winning the match on saturday			1
the only thing that matters is what happens on the pitch and that is how you will be judged			0
i ’m hoping the disappointment of the last two games especially can galvanise this team into producing something special in the next two matches			0
then , when i walk past my friend reading his paper on the boat next week , he might say : ‘ wow , did you see @entity13 play yesterday ? that was fantastic			2
’ @entity235 ( centre ) would add dynamism to @entity13 's play and he would get around the park well @entity248 has impressed and may come into the team at the expense of @entity213			1

@entity13 lost their fifth match in a row against @entity48 on saturday
coach @entity45 must focus on winning against @entity26
@entity13 need a *victory* and must stop using *excuses* of building for future
@entity248 , @entity235 and @entity202 could come in to side
