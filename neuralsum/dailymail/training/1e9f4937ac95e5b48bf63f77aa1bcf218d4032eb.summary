a man who suffered a serious eye injury as a child has got a tattoo - on his eyeball			2
@entity5 , 58 , underwent the extremely rare cosmetic procedure - which is definitely not for the squeamish - while he was awake			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity7 , experienced damage to his eye when he was hit in the face by a ball when he was a child , leaving his left iris looking permanently white and cloudy			1
the cosmetic procedure does not improve the actual condition of the damaged eye but the injected ink allows the pupil to look normal			2
the procedure was carried out by dr @entity21 of @entity32 and @entity33 , a tattoo artist from the @entity35 tattoo shop in @entity36 , @entity7			0
speaking before the procedure , mr @entity5 said : ' it will be a big change			1
i wont have the scar tissue no more and i 'll be able to look people in the eye without people saying too much about it			0
' dr @entity21 ( left ) set the ink - which was injected into @entity5 's eye - into place with a swab on the pupil mr @entity5 decided to get the unusual tattoo as his eye drew unwanted attention and stares from strangers ' also , taking pictures without a whiteness in my eye - i 'll feel a lot better			1
' dr @entity21 did the actual tattooing while mr @entity33 mixed the colours and assisted him in his work			0
to make sure the hour - long procedure was done accurately , the pair practised pupil tattooing manoeuvres beforehand on a grape			1
mr @entity5 was first given an anaesthetic and then injected with coloured ink , which was then set into place with a swab on the pupil			1
