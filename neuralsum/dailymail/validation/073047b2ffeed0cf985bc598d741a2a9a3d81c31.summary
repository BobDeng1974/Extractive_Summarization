almost 50 years ago , @entity0 launched two men into space in the same spacecraft for the first time - a milestone for @entity6 human spaceflight			1
but the groundbreaking mission is n’t necessarily remembered for this feat. two hours into the mission , one of the pilots pulled out a contraband corned beef sandwich which sparked a controversial incident that was debated all the way to @entity15			1
the @entity18 mission of 23 march 1965 , @entity6 's first two - man spaceflight , was shrouded in controversy when astronaut @entity20 snuck a corned beef sandwich on board			1
the sandwich is shown here embedded in acrylic and is exhibited at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 the incident was explained by @entity29 at @entity30 , on spaceflight missions , the items astronauts are allowed to take with them are extremely restricted			2
and in the @entity36 , at the dawn of the space age , restrictions were more enforced than ever as @entity0 wanted to ensure each risky mission passed without a hitch			2
the @entity40 programme was designed to develop and test capabilities that would ultimately land humans on the moon in the @entity45 missions			0
the first crewed @entity40 flight , @entity18 , lifted off @entity47 19 at @entity48 in @entity49 on march 23 , 1965			1
the spacecraft , nicknamed @entity51 , carried astronauts @entity54 ' @entity53 , command pilot , and @entity56 , pilot , on three orbits of @entity59			2
@entity0 's two - man @entity40 spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft			1
they also pioneered rendezvous and docking with other spacecraft			0
all were essential skills to land on the moon and return safely to @entity59			0
@entity18 's primary goal was to test the new , manoeuverable @entity40 spacecraft			2
in space , the crew members fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit , shift their orbital plane slightly , and drop to a lower altitude			2
this paved the way to the manoeuvres needed for the success of the @entity45 missions			0
so when astronaut @entity20 pulled out a sandwich from his spacesuit , two hours after launching from @entity48 in @entity49 , mission controllers were understandably perturbed			1
‘ where did that come from ? ’ co-astronaut @entity90 asked @entity20 when he produced the previously hidden item , in a bizarre exchange you can read in @entity0 ’s transcript of the mission			1
‘ i brought it with me			0
let ’s see how it tastes			0
smells , does n’t it ? ’ @entity20 replied			0
he had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut @entity100 , who was known for his pranks within the agency			0
but the stunt , although amusing , could have had serious consequences			0
space food was typically prepared in liquid or cube form to prevent crumbs spilling out and potentially getting stuck in a key piece of equipment			2
the sandwich though , having not been vetted for launch , quickly began to break apart , which would later earn the astronauts a severe reprimand			0
‘ it ’s breaking up			0
i ’m going to stick it in my pocket , ’ said @entity53			0
‘ is it ? it was a thought , anyway , ’ replied @entity20			0
‘ not a very good one , ’ said @entity53			0
the rest of the almost five - hour mission passed without incident and the astronauts were treated to stunning views as they orbited @entity59			2
‘ that ’s beautiful ! ’ exclaimed @entity20 , looking out a window			0
but on their return to @entity59 , the astronauts soon found that not everyone had seen the funny side of their exchange in orbit			0
pictured here in their spacesuits are @entity54 ' @entity53 ( left ) and @entity56 , seen with the portable suit air conditioners connected and their helmets on			0
@entity20 would go on to be one of @entity0 's most decorated astronauts , but @entity53 died in the @entity139 launchpad fire on 27 january 1967 @entity20 had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut @entity100 , who was known for his pranks within the agency , and put it inside his spacesuit on the way to the launchpad , seen here			1
@entity20 is walking in front with @entity53 behind , as they head for the elevator at @entity47 19 for their three - orbit flight the first crewed @entity40 flight , @entity18 , lifted off @entity47 19 at @entity48 in @entity49 on march 23 , 1965 , pictured left			1
the spacecraft was incredibly cramped , seen in a simulator on the right ( @entity20 is left , @entity53 right ) , and thus the movements and actions of the astronauts inside were severely restricted the major fear of having crumbs in a spacecraft was that they could get stuck in various controls , something that featured in the 15th episode of the fifth season of @entity165 , @entity166 , when @entity167 opened and spilled a bag of crisps in space ( shown ) ‘ my thought is that ... to have one of the astronauts slip a sandwich aboard the vehicle , frankly , is just a little bit disgusting , ’ representative @entity171 of @entity172 later said to @entity0 administrators in @entity174			1
‘ we have taken steps ... to prevent recurrence of corned beef sandwiches in future flights , ’ replied @entity181 , associate administrator for manned spaceflight			2
despite the incident , the astronauts were not prohibited from flying again			0
here 's some we made earlier : shown is the official food taken into space on the @entity18 mission , including dehydrated beef pot roast , bacon and egg bites , toasted bread cubes , orange juice and a wet wipe			1
water is being inserted into the pouch of dehydrated food in the image @entity0 's two - man @entity40 spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft			1
pictured is the later @entity210 in orbit , as seen from @entity212 during a rendezvous mission in december 1965 the @entity214 pulls up alongside the @entity18 spacecraft during recovery operations following the successful flight on 23 march 1965			1
@entity219 swimmers stand on the spacecraft 's flotation collar waiting to hook a hoist line to the spacecraft indeed , @entity20 would became one of @entity0 ’s most decorated astronauts , flying on the subsequent @entity227 and @entity45 10 missions , and also setting foot on the moon on @entity230			1
he was also part of the inaugural @entity233 mission - @entity234 in 1981 - which amusingly was the first time @entity0 allowed corned beef on a flight - before his sixth and final mission , @entity238 , in 1983			1
sadly , @entity90 ’s next mission was @entity45 1 , designed to be a low - earth orbit test of the @entity241			1
in a routine test on 27 january 1967 , the capsule caught fire , killing all three crew members - @entity90 , @entity246 and @entity247 - inside the module .			1

the @entity18 mission launched from @entity49 on 23 march 1965
on board it had astronauts - @entity90 and @entity20
it was the first two - man mission for @entity6 's space programme
but it was shrouded in controversy when @entity20 sneaked food on board
he hid a corned beef sandwich in his spacesuit and took it out in orbit
mission control feared the crumbs could *damage* spacecraft *systems*
both astronauts were severely reprimanded in @entity15
