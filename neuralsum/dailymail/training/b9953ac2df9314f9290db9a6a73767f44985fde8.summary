' unfortunately we are the punchbag for some people and it 's easy to have a punchbag like us			2
we 're a soft target and the easiest target			0
' @entity59 should not be attacking the weakest point – the people who are actually supporting him – but the people who were not supporting him			0
i would have thought the whole of football should have turned up at that court case wanting justice			0
@entity19 's older brother @entity2 partnered @entity18 at the heart of @entity38 's defence for several years @entity27 's slogan is ' @entity73 '			1
the organisation was launched in 1993 by the @entity75 and the @entity76			2
according to its website , it ' is primarily a campaigning organisation which enables , facilitates and works with the football authorities , professional clubs , players , fans and communities to tackle all forms of discrimination			2
' ' the @entity28 , the @entity87 , the clubs , all the people with the real power , not us , and who missed an opportunity and did n't mobilise			1
' we are a soft target , but i do n't hear criticism of @entity97 or @entity98			0
we did as much as we could but what it shows is a complete lack of understanding about our actual powers			0

@entity2 refused to shake the hand of @entity18 during a match between @entity10 and @entity131 in september 2012 @entity1 joined the @entity132 in 2001 and is a cross-party peer			1
as well as being chairman of @entity27 , the 69 - year - old chairs the @entity135 and is an @entity28 council member			1
the south @entity137 supports his local club @entity138 but also reportedly has a soft spot for @entity140			0

i have no hang - ups about being criticised but it has to be based on fair and accurate information			2
' i just want to put the record straight			0
we had someone there with the family in court every day - @entity30 's club [ @entity10 ] was n't there , his union was n't there every day , but we were			1
was @entity59 himself even there ? ' we gave as much support as we could give , we could not do any more , we had no power to do so			2
we spoke to the club and the police and had meetings			0
if the clubs had acted properly in the @entity18 case and the @entity167 case we would not have had all this grief			2
' kick it out had had a number of meetings with the @entity2 family before the trial , but decided it could not agree to their request for their staff to wear campaigning t - shirts in court			1
@entity1 said he had been happy for @entity2 and @entity180 to later boycott the @entity27 t - shirts because it was only when people ' put their heads above the parapet ' that changes were made			1
@entity2 ( left ) refused to wear a @entity27 t - shirt before @entity140 's game against @entity188 in 2012 he added : ' i want more to speak out and challenge inequality			1
you only see action when people speak out - it was only when @entity194 walked off the pitch in @entity196 that @entity197 sat up and took notice			0
' @entity1 also expanded on his reasons for resigning from the @entity200 , revealing it came after then @entity28 chairman @entity97 refused to issue an apology on behalf of the governing body for the way it had handled the @entity18 case			2
he said : ' i wanted the chairman to issue a full apology			0
they mishandled those cases and caused so much grief and because he refused to do , i relinquished my place on the @entity200			0
' the @entity2 family were severely abused , i was severely abused - i got hundreds of abusive emails - and they deserved a full apology			2
' @entity1 was also highly critical of @entity217 and their then manager @entity218 after @entity167 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity219			1
the @entity27 chairman added : ' @entity217 could have been sanctioned three times over the @entity167 incident , @entity218 's behaviour was appalling			1
@entity30 ( right ) leaves @entity224 after the @entity18 racism case in july 2012 ' @entity226 was manager of @entity131 and kept on saying @entity18 would always be their captain whatever the outcome			0
' the @entity28 only did something about him being @entity38 captain when they were about to go off to @entity230 and the whole thing was incendiary and very toxic			0
they hid behind the police inquiry but it is the fa that regulates football and the @entity2 family were given so much grief			2
