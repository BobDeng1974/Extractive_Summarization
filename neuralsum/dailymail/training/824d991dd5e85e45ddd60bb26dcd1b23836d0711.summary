by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 12:30 est , 14 january 2013 chatting on mobile phones while dressed in traditional ceremonial garb , these young @entity2 women embody a country of contrasts			1
the giggling girls - who all turn 20 this year and officially enter adulthood - were attending a @entity9 event at @entity10			1
in exquisite scenes last week , snow fell in giant flakes as young ladies processed together in beautiful kimonos at theme parks and sparkling venues across @entity2			1
blossoming into adulthood : the girls laugh , chatter and text excitedly as they celebrate turning 20 at the colourful event picture perfect : the young women trudge through heavy snow in traditional costume - but their smiles stay in place exotic birds : two young women stand out from fellow train passengers in their vibrant outfits as they make their way home big day : the girls spend hours in hair and beauty salons preparing for the ceremony - an extravagant event second only to a wedding blend is beautiful : a young woman in a rainbow - bright outfit stands talking on her phone in front of a line of vending machines - a symbol of @entity2 today not your average commuters : the girls look unselfconscious as they travel home on typical modes of transport after the celebration , attended by 1,200 young people @entity58 : this girl goes for a different look with a scarlet parasol , defying the trend for delicate white umbrellas perfect poise : a soft and wistful look is more tradition for the day , honoured by @entity2 people across the country goodbye to childhood things : the cheerful 20 - year - olds celebrated on stage with their favourite @entity73 characters handbags and gladrags : while some went to @entity10 , others celebrated their special day at @entity78 in @entity10 our turn now : the ancient event used to differ for boys and girls and take place when they were younger but it has existed in its present form since the 1940s flurry of activity : the young ladies wrap their kimonos round them and tread carefully , embroidered bags jostling with leather handbags on their arms moving through the seasons : the 20 - year - olds process through the snow at @entity10 as they attend the formal @entity9 ceremony modern and traditional : the young women wear expensive @entity101 kimonos and traditional socks and sandals for the historical ceremony - but today 's @entity105 can not do without their mobile phones new responsibilities : the event marks a transition into adulthood			1
after 20 , young people can vote , buy alcohol or tobacco and be tried as adults in court flower power : the girls look gorgeous in their painstakingly made pink , orange and blue ensembles back in time : trees tower over the revellers at @entity78 as snow blankets @entity10 , bringing much of the local transport to a halt stopping traffic : flights to and from the capital 's haneda airport were cancelled last week , parts of the expressways temporarily closed and local train services were delayed thanks to the swirling snow a @entity101 , named for its long swinging sleeves , is a formal kimono for unmarried women			1
the longer the sleeve , the higher the status			2
brides wear them on their wedding day			2
it is usually made from @entity144 ( silk ) or @entity146 ( crepe ) in an ' @entity149 ' design : meaning the pattern is spread over panels like a painting			2
it is worn with an @entity155 - a colourful sash tied in a large bow at the back			1
stiffeners and ribbons add shape and decoration			0
a fine , formal obi might cost more than the kimono itself			0
a hip - or thigh - length kimono - like jacket called a @entity167 can be worn on top to add formality			1
a robe called a @entity171 , worn beneath the outer kimono , keeping the delicate fabric clean by preventing contact with the wearer 's skin			0
only the collar edge shows			0
a thin half - slip - like piece of underwear called a @entity180 is worn under the nagajuban			1
a narrow sash ( @entity183 ) , often made of silk or wool , can hold virtually anything in place			0
a karihimo worn around the hips to create the extra fold or ohashori in a woman 's kimono is called @entity193 , literally ' hip ribbon '			0
on their feet , the girls wear @entity197 , ankle socks with a separation between the big toe and other toes			0
these are worn with @entity202 , sandals with thick wooden soles that keep feet well above the ground			0
a fabric thong runs between the toes and two supporting wooden teeth are fixed underneath , sometimes with metal plates on			0
at times , the girls looked solemn and reverential beneath translucent white umbrellas , with their matching fur stoles wrapped tightly around their necks to keep out the cold			0
at others , they laughed hysterically with friends , clutching @entity73 carrier bags and texting furiously - looking just like the tech - savvy , fashionable face of @entity218 today			2
the elegant @entity101 kimonos are likely to be the most extravagant clothes a @entity2 woman will wear until her wedding day			1
the majority of young men celebrating wear suits for the occasion , although some still wear the more traditional male kimono			0
a @entity101 can cost in excess of Â£ 6,000 ( $ 10,000 ) , so many rent the outfit to reduce the cost			0
hours are spent in hairdressers and salons getting ready for the big event			2
@entity236 , or @entity236 , is a national holiday that celebrates the transition into adulthood for young @entity240 , according to @entity241			1
they are now able to vote , legally buy alcohol and tobacco and to be tried as adults if they break the law			1
the ceremony came into being as a @entity249 religious rite for members of samurai families			1
the boys ' ceremony was originally called @entity254 and could take place between the ages of 10 and 16			0
during the event , they would be presented with a headdress called an @entity259 and receive an adult male name denoting their new role and responsibilities as an adult , such as marriage			2
the girls ' celebration , then called @entity268 , would occur during the ages of 12 and 16 , when they would receive a special kimono and be allowed to dress as an adult female for the first time			0
the age of 20 was set as the year a young person moved into adulthood in 1876 , during the @entity276			1
the modern version of the occasion came into existence in 1948 and now takes place on the second monday of january each year			2
a formal gathering attended by parents and organised by government office ' @entity236 ' marks the start of proceedings			0
in recent years , some young @entity240 can be heard heckling or letting off fireworks rather than listening dutifully to the sometimes lengthy and serious speeches explaining their new responsibilities as adults in society			0
after that , many 20 - year - olds visit a shrine with their families before the day ends in a more relaxed manner with young people gathering for parties with friends			1
reflective moment : the rain and snow could not put a dampener on the high spirits of these young people @entity305 history : the event began life as a @entity249 religious rite for members of samurai families only moving forward : clutching bags of @entity73 souvenirs , the perfectly coiffed young women head to parties with friends after the speeches with their parents			1

the 20 - year - olds celebrated transition into adulthood at @entity10
they wore exquisite outfits for the event , which began life as a samurai rite
@entity2 people are able to vote and legally buy alcohol after 20
