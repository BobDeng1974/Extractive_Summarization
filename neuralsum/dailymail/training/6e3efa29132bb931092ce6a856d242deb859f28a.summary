@entity0 has remarkably been pulled off man - marking duties at corners and set - pieces as @entity6 attempt to shield him from the ' grappling ' spotlight			1
the defender was named as a serial offender of penalty area ' dark arts ' by former referee @entity12 as we launched our ' @entity15 ' campaign			1
ten days ago @entity0 conceded a spot - kick after wrapping his arms around @entity18 in @entity6 2 - 1 victory over @entity20 but in the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity22 on saturday he was asked to mark zonally			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity40 vs @entity42 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			2
and that means fewer goals in the @entity46			0
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			2
it 's time to end that			2
so join us in our campaign to say @entity54 to players and referees			2
we 'll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
referee @entity62 's decision to penalise the player appears to have had the required deterrent effect			1
@entity6 admit they took action simply because they thought @entity0 's reputation could make him an easy target for other officials even if he did nothing wrong			1
@entity6 assistant manager @entity70 said : ' it seemed as though @entity0 was singled out			1
it was no doubt it was a penalty in the strict sense of the word because of what @entity0 was doing			1
' but you see it time and again at every game across the country and in @entity80 as well			0
' on saturday — and it should n't happen like this — we tried to pull him out of the spotlight if you like			2
so instead of @entity0 marking from a corner , we put him in an area where he could attack the ball in a more zonal area			1
' that 's not his game , he 's not been brought up on that			2
but it comes to something where you 've got to try and change your system of marking because you 're worried the lad is getting targeted			2
' he 's our captain , one of our best headers of the ball			2
you want @entity0 to be marking their most dangerous player			1
even if @entity0 does n't do a full grab but the referee is looking for him , you could n't leave that to chance			1
it 's at the detriment to us			2
' the increasing scourge of man - handling rivals at corners and set - pieces is blighting the game and players know they can get away with it			1
@entity42 pair @entity119 and @entity120 , who between them know every trick in the book , were caught by @entity40 's @entity124 and @entity125 in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity127			1
@entity119 was so riled that he tweeted a complaint that he and @entity120 had been ' double headlocked '			1
referee @entity129 took no action			1
in his defence of @entity0 , @entity70 then highlighted the other covert crimes committed in the box , as if that was some justification			1
our campaign is to stamp out wrestling , grappling , man - handling , blocking and all the other cheating tactics used by professional footballers			1
former @entity141 defender @entity70 pointed the finger at @entity20 pair @entity18 and @entity144 and claimed that they , too , should have been prevented from blocking tactics			1
@entity6 defender @entity0 ( right ) tussles with @entity22 forward @entity148 ( centre ) @entity148 ( left ) challenges @entity0 ( right ) in the air during @entity22 's 1 - 0 win against @entity6 at @entity152 's ' is it just holding or is it when people are handing others off ? ' questioned @entity70			1
' we looked at @entity20 , they do two blocks on corners			1
@entity144 will stand there and as @entity18 is running past he will turn and block the runner			0
' i 'm not having a go at @entity20 , a lot of teams do it			2
but is that as cynical as holding ? of course it is			0
it 's foul play but different clubs have different ways of gaining that little advantage			0
' @entity70 is not the first to admit that coaches regard sneaky fouling in the area as a legitimate tactic			2
it is impossible for the referee and his assistants to spot who is pushing and it is not unusual to see several players on the ground as the ball flies into the area			0
managers and coaches also know that it is highly unlikely a referee will start to award lots of penalties and / or issue several yellow cards so the offenders get away with it			0
even @entity70 did not attempt to deny @entity0 's misdemeanour against @entity18			1
his gripe was that the player had been singled out for punishment on a day when there were others breaking the rules too			0
@entity0 ( right ) grabs the arm of @entity203 striker @entity202 at the @entity205 last season @entity206 - eyed @entity62 acted while colleague @entity129 either missed the fouls or chose to ignore them			1
' you wonder if @entity62 was seriously looking for something in that area , @entity129 maybe had a more general picture let 's say , ' added @entity70			1
that inconsistency annoys managers and coaches and also prevents a change of behaviour			0
@entity70 believes that the only way to alter the mindset is by an early avalanche of red cards			2
losing players in games and to suspensions would be the immediate and unpopular result			0
@entity70 added : ' the only possible way of eradicating it is if every single time it happens it 's punished			1
that might take a significant amount of penalties for all sides throughout the league			0
' then in maybe two months ' time or so , you would see a lot more goals because strikers would get first run on defenders			0
' no more pushing , but plenty more goals - @entity242 would settle for that			1
@entity119 , @entity42 captain ' me and @entity120 were double headlocked at every corner			1
' @entity247 , @entity248 assistant manager ' grappling			1
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ' interpretation and we 'll leave it to them			0
that 's what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it 's in their hands really			1
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n't have to mark anyone			0
' @entity269 , @entity270 striker ' there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			2
it was like @entity276 in the @entity40 area			0
' @entity12 , former top referee ' hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
' @entity285 , @entity270 defender ' defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			1
' @entity293 , @entity294 manager ' in a congested area how can you judge if someone 's been blocked ? it 's part of the game and some people are good at it			2
a local @entity304 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
' can you show me some blocking techniques ? ' that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n't be given as penalties			0
there has to be consistency			0
' and the readers of @entity320 ... ' it 's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it 's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
' @entity328 , @entity329 ' to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i 've been watching football since the @entity340 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i 've ever seen			0
' sir @entity343 , @entity345			0
