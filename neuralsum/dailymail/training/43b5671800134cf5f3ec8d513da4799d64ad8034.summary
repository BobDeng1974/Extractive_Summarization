by @entity0 for @entity1 many adults now avoid many foods , believing themselves to be intolerant or allergic eating with a group of friends can nowadays be fraught with the difficulties , as more and more people claim to be prey to food allergies , intolerances and diet specifications			2
this is n't surprising , given that more than one in five adults is avoiding certain foods because of an allergy or intolerance - even if many of them only think they have it , according to new research			1
but genuine or not , it means up to a third of households have had to adapt mealtimes to cope with a member of the family who can not or does not eat certain foods			0
and that has led to a ' phenomenal ' growth for the industry providing foods free from gluten , lactose , nuts or a host of other ingredients affecting millions of @entity35			0
a survey for trade body , the @entity38 , found 22 per cent of adults said they had either an allergy or intolerance to certain foods or drink			1
the poll of 1,600 adults did not ask for proof , so it is entirely possible that many may have wrongly linked health or digestion problems to particular types of food that they now avoid			2
dairy and gluten are the most popular types of food to be given up by those who believe they have an allergy or intolerance , said the industry body			1
the survey was commissioned ahead of a summit on the ' free from ' industry next week in @entity63			0
it found twice as many women as men say they have an allergy or intolerance			1

' but the spread across the classes is fairly even			0
' new @entity89 regulations mean any restaurant , pub or other catering service must , from december , list all potential allergens in the ingredients for all meals and products			0
the research added these will have a ' dramatic effect on the catering and food service industry			0

new study found 22 per cent said they had either an allergy or intolerance
no proof was required , so many may be incorrectly self - *diagnosing*
@entity110 and gluten are the most popular types of food to be given up
twice as many women as men say they have an intolerance or allergy
incidence is also higher in the south of @entity84 than the north
