facebook users are so enamored with the man in a mugshot posted to the @entity3 , @entity5 page wednesday that they liked the felon 's police photo over 20,000 times in less than 24 hours			1
the ice blue - eyed , strong - jawed likeness of @entity10 was just as quickly plastered across @entity12 as thousands of social media users have themselves been arrested ... by the 30 - year - old 's undeniable good looks			1
@entity10 , already a convicted felon , was hauled in as part of a gang police sweep , but he 's the one sweeping internet denizens off their feet			1
his arresting mugshot was subsequently posted to the police department 's @entity27 page and in fewer than 24 hours gained over 20,000 likes and received nearly six thousand comments and counting the police puns continue on the @entity32 , where the photo had an unbelievable 5,800 comments by thursday evening			1
most comments stuck to the obvious jokes : ' what is he guilty of ? ! @entity39 ? ! ' wrote @entity40			2
others , like @entity42 , saw a moneymaking opportunity			2
' he 'll probably be on next years prison calendar ... mr. ... every month ! ' she wrote			0
by far , one of the most thing to post was a comment about @entity10 having missed his calling as a model			1
' he needs to be a model , ' wrote @entity54			0
' i would buy whatever he 's selling ! ' @entity10 was charged with illegally possessing firearms and ammo , carrying a loaded firearm in public and criminal street gang activity , reports @entity61			1

' he did n't know any different			0
i could turn him into a " model " citizen			0
