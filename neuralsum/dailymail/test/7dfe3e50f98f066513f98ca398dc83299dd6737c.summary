in true @entity2 style , he was not content with simply breaking the 100 goals barrier for @entity4 on wednesday evening			1
the 33 - year - old added another two to make it a hat - trick on the night and take his total tally to 102 goals in less than three years in the @entity11 capital			1
to put his remarkable goalscoring record at @entity4 into perspective , he now trails only former @entity15 forward @entity14 in the all - time record books			1
@entity14 scored 109 in 211 games for @entity4 between 2003 and 2008 , @entity2 has played in just 124 games so far			1
@entity2 slides on his knees after scoring for @entity4 in their semi-final on wednesday the @entity4 star was presented with a trophy to celebrate hitting 100 goals for the @entity11 side @entity2 ’s hat - trick and a goal from @entity27 saw them beat @entity29 4 - 1 and remain on course for a unique quadruple , with a @entity33 quarter - final against @entity34 to come next week			1
after the match , @entity29 boss @entity35 called @entity2 the ‘ best foreigner to ever play in @entity11 , ’ and you would struggle to argue against that assessment			1
he has been a runaway success since arriving at @entity4 for £ 15.7m in july 2012 and claiming in his opening address to fans that he would become ‘ part of the history of the club			2
’ he stuck to his pledge and was @entity49 ’s top scorer in in his first season with 30 goals , compared with the next best on 19 goals			0
@entity29 boss @entity35 called @entity2 the ‘ best foreigner to ever play in @entity11 ' @entity2 is considered to be one of the finest strikers of his generation despite his volatile demeanour it was more of the same last season with 26 goals to his closest rival on 16			1
this season he has faced a challenge from @entity64 of @entity65 who is currently at the top of the @entity11 goalscoring charts but you would not bet against @entity2 catching him before the end of the season			1
his goals for @entity4 have ranged from the straightforward to the important and the downright incredible – notably an audacious back heeled volley during a 4 – 0 win over @entity74 in 2013			2
@entity2 , pictured with wednesday night 's match ball , has never played in the @entity76 many consider @entity2 to be one of the finest strikers of his generation with an eye for the spectacular , an incredible athleticism and brilliance in the air			1
but a criticism often levelled at @entity2 is that he has never played in the @entity76			1
the longest spell he has ever spent at one club is three seasons so on that basis a move away from @entity4 could be on the horizon			1
but would he choose the @entity76 for a last hurrah ? here @entity90 looks at his record his six previous clubs			1
@entity93 – 2000/01 came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with them in 1996			0
played six matches and scored one goal in his first season and @entity101 were relegated			0
his 13 goals in 28 matches was a major factor in getting them straight back into @entity107 ’s top tier the next year			2
around this time @entity108 expressed an interest in bringing @entity2 to @entity110 but he eventually moved to @entity111 for a fee of £ 6million			2
@entity2 came through the youth ranks at the club and signed his first contract with @entity101 in 1996 @entity2 moved to @entity111 in 2001 after catching the eye at his hometown club @entity111 2001/02 – 2004/05 there was initial frustration for the striker who did not feature prominently in manager @entity121 ’s plans but once @entity122 took over he was given a starting berth , playing a key part as @entity111 won the @entity126 title in his first season			2
he scored twice in a 2 - 1 win over @entity65 in his @entity33 debut in september 2002 with @entity111 eventually falling at the quarter final stage			0
@entity133 team - mate @entity132 accused @entity2 of trying to deliberately injure him in an international game and the dispute precipitated his move away from the club			1
@entity2 is pictured in action for @entity111 in their @entity33 clash against @entity140 back in 2003 @entity141 2004/05 – 2005/06 he reportedly expressed an interest recently in moving back to the @entity144 club where he feels he has unfinished business			2
he made an instant impact in the side which had just lost main striker @entity148 through injury , scoring 16 goals in his first season			0
the following season was a different story as he was pushed out onto the flank to play a supporting role			0
he seemed unmotivated at times and was criticised by fans for his apparent lack of effort in big games			0
@entity141 were hard hit by the investigation into the @entity144 football scandal and relegated to @entity162 at which time @entity2 demanded to be released			2
@entity2 scored 16 goals in his first season for @entity141 but only lasted two years with the @entity165 club @entity166 2006/07 – 2008/09 @entity166 won the @entity165 title each of the three seasons @entity2 was at the club			1
it took him little time to adjust as he scored 15 goals in his first season			2
he scored five @entity33 goals in the 2007/08 campaign and in may 2008 netted both goals in a 2 – 0 defeat of @entity177 on the final day of the season which sealed the @entity179 ( @entity144 title ) and a personal @entity182 trophy			0
he was the league ’s top scorer in 2008/09 with 25 goals , helping @entity166 to another scudetto			0
he was also named ' @entity186 ' for a second consecutive season			0
following his spell at @entity141 , @entity2 moved to @entity166 where he won the title on three occasions @entity34 2009/10 - 2010/11 playing in possibly the best club side of all time – including @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 – @entity2 immediately set a club record for scoring in all five of his first games			1
he went on to be named in the @entity200 and was the sixth highest scorer in the league as @entity34 won @entity203			0
his final goal for @entity34 came in a 3 – 1 defeat over @entity206 which sealed a second @entity207 for @entity2			0
but his relationship with manager @entity209 had broken down and it was time to move on			0
@entity2 scored in his first five games for @entity34 , but left after two years in @entity212 to join @entity140 @entity140 2010/11 – 2011/12 @entity2 returned to @entity213 on loan with an option to buy for around £ 17.5m at the end of the season			1
he missed a penalty in his debut game but things soon picked up and he scored 14 league goals and won his first scudetto with @entity140 , who completed their full purchase of him at the end of the season			0
his disciplinary record continued to be flawed and he was sent off for punching @entity228 defender @entity227 in the gut and for slapping @entity231 ’s @entity230			0
he was @entity165 ’s top scorer in the 2011/12 season with 28 goals			0
@entity2 made his move back to @entity213 , firstly on loan , before he signed a permanent deal to join @entity140			0

@entity2 scored a hat - trick for @entity4 on wednesday night
it took his tally for the @entity11 club to 102 goals in less than three years
he now trails only former @entity15 forward @entity14 in all - time list
the longest spell he has ever spent at one club is three seasons
