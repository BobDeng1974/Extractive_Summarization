the girl , who was brandishing two knives and threatening to harm herself , was one of more than 20 children shot by officers using the electric stun guns , figures show			0
police said the @entity3 was used to detain the girl and ‘ prevent serious harm to both her , the public and the officers ’ after she began behaving ‘ aggressively ’ in @entity15 , @entity16 , in july 2011			2
shocked : around 24 young children have been hit with a 50,000 - volt police @entity3 in the last three years - the youngest being just 12 - years - old although the girl was unhurt in the incident there are fears that being hit with a taser can increase the risk of fatal heart attacks			1
the schoolgirl was one of more than 20 children stunned with the weapons in the past three years , according to figures obtained under the @entity29			1
they included six children aged 14 , four aged 15 and 13 aged 16			1
scores of other children , some as young as 11 , have been threatened with the weapons			2
' safety measures ' : at least 194 children aged 16 or under have had @entity3 deployed on them to some degree in the last three years ( posed by models ) in total , at least 194 children aged 16 or under have had @entity3 used on them in the past three years , according to figures uncovered by the investigative agency @entity40			1
of these , at least 24 were actually shot by the @entity3 – a barb attached by a wire to deliver an electric shock of up to 50,000 volts			1
these details taken from police records explian the reasons why tasers have been used on young people			1
a 12 - year - girl was shot in @entity15 by @entity50 after she was said to have armed her herself with two knives and threatening to harm herself			2
two 11 - year - old boys armed with knives in @entity55 were targeted by red laser dots from a taser			0
a 14 - year - old girl in @entity59 was accidentally shot as officers tried to arrest a suspect in the city			0
a 14 - year - old burglary suspect armed with a screwdriver was shot in @entity65 , south @entity66			0
a 14 - year - old was shot with @entity3 in @entity68 after the teen attacked another person with cosh - a truncheon - like weapon			1

a 15 - year - old was shot in @entity86 , @entity87 , after an alleged assault			0
a 15 - year - old was tasered in @entity90 after apparently being violent towards an officer and carrying a knuckle duster			0
last night young people ’s charities and human rights organisations said the use of @entity3 on children was deeply worrying			1
the high - powered weapons should be fired on children only as a last resort , they said			2
@entity102 ’s @entity101 said : ‘ in the @entity104 more than 500 people have died after being shocked by a taser and , in many instances , the coroner declared the @entity3 a contributory factor			1
’ tasers are increasingly being carried by @entity111 police after being introduced in 2004			0
many officers on the beat can now carry the weapons after just a short training course			0
at least six children were ‘ drive - stunned ’ by @entity3 – where the electric device is held directly against the body			1
another 97 children were ‘ red dotted ’ , with officers pointing the taser at the child and pinpointing exactly where the barbs would hit their body with a red ‘ sniper ’ dot			2
this included a 15 - year - old targeted by @entity130 after he threw a glass at shop staff and took up a ‘ fighting stance ’ with his eyes ‘ squinted ’ as officers approached			0
the use of the stun weapons against young children comes despite advice to the @entity140 that @entity3 are more likely to cause heart problems in children			1
the advice , from independent scientific body @entity144 on the @entity146 , was published in the @entity147 ’ taser guidelines			0
it notes ‘ children and adults of smaller stature as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of @entity3 currents than normal adults of average or larger stature ’			1
@entity158 , chairman of the @entity159 , a coalition of more than 25 voluntary bodies campaigning for youth justice reform , said the findings were ‘ really shocking ’			0
‘ the number of incidents indicate that the police are not using other techniques to calm potentially vulnerable or disturbed teenagers , ’ she said			0
a total of 27 forces provided responses on the use of @entity3 against children during 2010 , 2011 and 2012			2
but the true figure of taser use on young children is likely to be much higher .			1

a schoolgirl , 12 , is one of 24 young children to be hit with a full 50,000 - volt
but at least 194 children aged 16 or under have been shocked with @entity3 at lower levels in the last three years
young people *'s* charities and human rights organisations claim use of @entity3 on children may cause heart problems later on
