by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 04:28 est , 1 january 2013 teenagers who do not have the internet are at a serious disadvantage in their education , a study shows			2
pupils whose families have a computer are likely to achieve higher grades because the benefits of such technology outweighs any perceived risks			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity15 kids are unable to access the internet at home either because parents can not afford it or fear the disruptive affects of social networking websites			1
the study found that teenagers who did not have internet access at home were at a major social and educational disadvantage the study by @entity26 , carried out between 2008 and 2011 , estimated about ten per cent of the teenagers were without online connectivity at home - with most living in poorer households			1
the @entity31 suggests this dropped to five per cent in 2012 but that still leaves around 300,000 children without internet access in their homes			1
those without have a strong sense of being ' educationally disadvantaged ' , according to a survey of over a thousand households and interviews with more than two hundred teenagers and their families			1
the study by @entity26 , carried out between 2008 and 2011 , estimated about ten per cent of the teenagers were without online connectivity at home - with most living in poorer households			1
the @entity31 suggests this dropped to five per cent in 2012 but that still leaves around 300,000 children without internet access in their homes			1
teenagers said they felt shut out of their peer group socially and also disadvantaged in their studies as so much of the work set for them to do at home required online research or preparation			1
there was a high level of anxiety among parents about the potential of social networking sites to distract children and some despaired at their tendency to multitask on mobile devices			2
but researchers at the university 's department of education found there are substantial educational advantages in teenagers being able to access the internet at home			1
one teenager , whose parents had separated , explained he would ring his father who had internet access and any requested materials were then mailed to him through the post			2
dr @entity77 said : ' while it 's difficult to state a precise figure for teenagers without access to the internet at home the fact remains in the @entity15 there is something like 300,000 young people who do not - and that 's a significant number			1
' behind the statistics our qualitative research shows these disconnected young people are clearly missing out both educationally and socially			0
' one 14 year - old boy said : " we get coursework now in year 9 to see what groups we 're going to go in @entity97			2
the emergence of tablets has seen many teenagers using them for homework and running educational apps			2
now , those without could be at a disadvantage , researchers say			0
' and people with internet , they can get higher marks because they can like research on the internet ... my friends are probably on it [ @entity113 ] all the day every day			2
' and like they talk about it in school , what happened on @entity113			0
' another 15 year - old said : ' it was bell gone and i have a lot of things that i could write and i was angry that i have n't got a computer because i might finish it at home when i 've got lots of time to do it			2
' but because when i 'm at school i need to do it very fast			0
' strikingly , this study contradicts claims that others have made about the potential risks of such technologies adversely affecting the ability of teenagers to concentrate on serious study			0
the study contained in a new book teenagers and technology being published by @entity140 in january found no evidence to support this			0
it showed the internet has opened up far more opportunities for young people to do their learning at home			0
co-author dr @entity149 said : ' parental anxiety about how teenagers might use the very technologies they have bought their own children at considerable expense is leading some to discourage their children from becoming confident users			1
' the evidence , based on the survey and hundreds of interviews , shows parents have tended to focus on the negative side - especially the distracting effects of social networking sites - without always seeing the positive use their children often make of being online			1
' teenagers ' experiences of @entity167 appear to be mixed			0
some teens claimed that using @entity167 regularly caused arguments between friends although some regarded the site as an integral part of their social life others were concerned about the number of arguments that had escalated due to others wading in as a result of comments and photographs being posted			1
the age of teenagers using @entity167 for the first time was found to go down over the three year period from around 16 years old in 2008 to 12 or 13 by 2011			0
even the very youngest teenagers who were not particularly interested felt under some peer pressure to join			0
but the study also suggests the popularity of @entity167 is waning with teenagers now exploring other forms of social networking			0
dr @entity149 said : ' there is no steady state of teenage technology use - fashions and trends are constantly shifting and things change very rapidly when they do change			0

300,000 @entity15 children do not have online access at home
majority of teenagers without access lived in poorer households
teens claimed coursework was far more difficult to complete , and they *struggled* to keep in touch with friends
