@entity6 's friend then took a photograph of her holding the message board and posted it to her @entity5 page sparking the image to be shared more than 100,000 times			1

she told me that she had some information about my mum , and that she was my cousin			0
i was so confused , but it turned out that her father was my mum ’s brother			0
' i used to go round to @entity135 ’s house a lot when i was a teenager , so it turned out that i had known my uncle all along ! lots to talk about : @entity6 and sister @entity67 share details of their lives after growing up apart ' it was unbelievable , i could n’t believe that i had known some of my relatives			1
@entity135 had the same surname as my mum ’s maiden name but we never put two - and - two together because @entity158 is quite a common surname			0
' @entity6 was told her mother had changed her surname and after a quick search , found her mother ’s @entity5 page and sent her a message			1
within an hour @entity19 had replied and the pair exchanged phone numbers			2
