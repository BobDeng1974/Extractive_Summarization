taking on fluids : @entity3 will not be overcome by the @entity19 heat , according to @entity2 visiting : @entity2 , @entity20 and @entity21 visit the @entity23 da @entity22 ‘ we trained hard in @entity25 , we trained with the extra layers , we went to @entity27 and we stepped it up a little bit			1

’ the ‘ cooling systems ’ are giant industrial fans which spray cold water , designed to help the players cool down at half - time and after their opening group stage match against @entity39 on saturday night			1
