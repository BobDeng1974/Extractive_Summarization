by @entity0 published : 08:55 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:54 est , 26 february 2014 strange structures found inside a @entity5 meteorite could suggest that life may have existed on the red planet billions of years ago			1
the meteorite , named @entity9 , was found in @entity10 in 2000 and is thought to have formed on @entity5 over 1.3 billion years ago			1
scientists believe the rock was thrown into space by a huge impact on @entity5 and fell to @entity15 within the past 10,000 years			2
the red circle in this image of the meteorite shows spherules ithat are enriched in carbon , compared with the background material shown within the blue circle the discovery comes eighteen years after ‘ nanofossils ’ were found in a 4lb lump of rock that blasted off the surface of @entity5 millions of years ago			1
that meteorite , named @entity29 , generated headline news in 1996 when @entity31 announced it contained ‘ biomorphic ’ structures , tubule - like objects that look bacteria			2
‘ we 're convinced that this is another one of the important data points that is going toward answering the big question : was there life on @entity5 ? ’ @entity41 , a researcher at @entity31 ’s @entity42 who was involved in both studies , told @entity44			1
this image shows layers of minerals inside a meteorite from @entity5 , including micro-tunnels that researchers say are suggestive of erosion caused by microbes the discovery comes eighteen years after ‘ nanofossils ’ were found in a 4lb lump of rock blasted off the surface of @entity5 millions of years ago			1
that meteorite , named @entity29 , generated headline news in 1996 when @entity31 announced it contained ‘ biomorphic ’ structures , tubule - like objects that look bacteria			2
the report caused a sensation but many experts maintained that the features were n't biological in origin			0
he added , however , that the latest study wo n't answer the big question			0
‘ we do n't come out and say we have found life on @entity5 , ’ said dr @entity41			1
writing in the journal @entity72 , the scientists describe microscopic tunnels found throughout the meteorite 's interior			0
‘ the observed microtunnels display curved , undulating shapes consistent with bioalteration textures observed in basaltic glasses , ’ wrote the scientists			0
they also discovered tiny blobs of carbon - rich minerals that are embedded within layers of rock , which the team claim reveals ancient weathering through biological processes			2
the researchers say they ‘ can not exclude the possibility that the carbon - rich regions in both sets of features ’ are the product of non-biological processes			0
the team are now following up their findings with more detailed chemical analysis			0
the black arrows in this image point to the microtunnels found by @entity31 scientists			0

structures found in a meteorite that formed on @entity5 1.3 billion years ago
team claim they may have been formed by erosion from microbial life
the discovery comes eighteen years after alleged ‘ nanofossils ’ were found in a 4lb lump of @entity5 rock
