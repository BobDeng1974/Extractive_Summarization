@entity1 pulled up in the first half and was replaced by @entity9 's @entity8 with the @entity11 captain clearly in some distress			1
the new injury scare comes as a blow to both club and country , with @entity11 facing a fourth consecutive relegation battle and @entity4 needing their best and most influential players available after losing four of the last five games after finishing third at this summer 's @entity20			2
@entity1 pulled up in the first half of @entity4 's defeat to @entity5 on wednesday night in @entity6 despite @entity11 's poor form @entity1 's ( right ) showing in defence has attracted interest from other clubs but in hopeful news for @entity11 , @entity0 confirmed it is not the same niggling recurrence of the calf injury that ruled out the former @entity33 defender for 19 league games during the last three seasons for the club			1
@entity37 has been called - up to the squad to replace @entity1 , but the defender , on loan at @entity41 from @entity42 , only has one previous cap as a substitute in a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity46			0
@entity0 confirmed on wednesday night to @entity47 : ' it does not look good , @entity1 is having trouble with his calf			2
it 's not the same place as last time that was totally different			0
' @entity4 sit third in @entity54 with three points from three games , six points behind group leaders @entity60 and @entity59			0
they face @entity62 on sunday in @entity6			2
@entity1 's contract is due to expire at the end of the season , and the 29 - year - old been linked with a move to @entity68 and @entity69 , but contrary to reports from his agent the player has revealed he has had talks with @entity11 over an improved deal			1
speaking to the @entity75 earlier this week , @entity1 said : ' i have spoken to the gaffer ( @entity77 ) a few times ( about a new deal ) , but that is it so far			0
' @entity1 impressed at the @entity20 with @entity4 and has attracted interest from @entity68 and @entity69			0

@entity0 confirms @entity1 's injury does **n't** look good , but it is not the same problem that kept him out for large periods in the last three years
@entity1 pulled up in the first half of @entity4 's defeat to @entity5
he will miss sunday 's visit of @entity62 , a must - win game for @entity0
@entity0 has *suggested* he may resign if the @entity94 do **n't** win in @entity6
