a new batch of emails from @entity2 released by a congressional committee shed light on the former @entity7 official 's attempts to do damage control as the @entity9 targeting scandal gained steam			1
the emails show that @entity2 tried to frame the harassment of certain non-profit groups as ' front line staff people using less than stellar judgement ' to @entity18 inspectors months before she acknowledged the mistake publicly			1
they also reveal that @entity2 intended to apologize for those staff persons ' inappropriate conduct during a speech at a conference in april of 2013 , several weeks before she staged an apology during the question and answer portion of another conference , but that idea was ultimately nixed			2
the emails were part of a document dump made by the @entity34 - controlled @entity33 last week , headed by sen. @entity35 , as it released a report clearing the @entity7 and @entity2 , who retired from her position overseeing the tax - exempt division of the @entity7 after being placed on leave in 2013 , of politically motivated targeting			1
newly released emails from @entity2 show that the former @entity7 tax - exempt divisions head tried to convince @entity18 inspectors that @entity7 employees in a @entity47 office were n't scrutinizing conservative groups applying for non-profit tax statuses for political reasons @entity52 members of the committee , led by @entity55 senator @entity54 , released a report of their own on friday that contradicts their colleagues and claims that conservative groups were less likely to receive tax - exempt status from the government agency that their liberal counterparts			1
the @entity52 report is consistent with a may 2013 report released by the treasury inspector @entity64			0
@entity65 , who disagree with @entity64 's findings , attempted to set the record straight on friday by releasing 1,706 pages of new documents relating to the so - called targeting of conservative groups in the 2010 and 2012 election cycle			1
the newly released emails offer a glimpse into @entity2 's thinking on the targeting scandal			1
@entity2 has refused to testify before @entity78 on the issue on the grounds that she would incriminate herself if she did while insisting that she did not instruct employees to break the law			1
one email between a @entity18 inspector involved in the investigation and @entity2 from early 2013 show that the former @entity7 official tried to convince investigators that the actions of a @entity47 division of the @entity7 only ' appeared to be politically motivated ' but were n't			1
' i am willing to take the blame for having not provided sufficient direction initially , which may have resulted in front line staff doing things that appeared to be politically motivated , ' she told @entity18 's @entity95 in a january 31 email , ' but i am not on board that anything occurred here shows that the @entity7 was politically motivated in the actions taken			2
' @entity2 opined in the email that @entity18 investigators were being ' too narrow in their view and have decided that because of the language used in our earlier [ @entity105 ] regarding @entity9 , everything that followed was tainted			0
' she says the @entity7 already ' owned up ' to the fact that the @entity47 office was ' struggling ' to determine which applications should be subject to additional reviews and had sent a team out to train them earlier that month			0
furthermore , @entity2 states that @entity18 officials expressed to her that her department 's criteria for evaluating groups ' sounds reasonable			2
' however , ' they seem to be saying that reasonableness is overshadowed by the fact that the criteria look bad to folks on the outside , so there is no way we could cure the initial bad impression			0
' ' we understand why the criteria might raise questions , ' she admitted but claimed that investigators could not provide her a ' clear definition of what they meant by targeting ' and told her their investigation was n't necessarily about political targeting			0
she also claimed in the email that inspectors told her they were n't looking at whether groups affected were conservative or liberal ' because that is too difficult to figure out ' and that organizations of both political persuasions appear to be on the list			2
sen. @entity35 , left , talks with sen. @entity54 , right , on @entity141 in april of 2013			0
after investigating the @entity7 for more than a year , the two @entity142 - one of whom is a @entity144 , @entity35 , and and one of whom is a @entity52 , @entity54 - said on friday they disagree on whether @entity2 's division treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
@entity54 says it did in an email exchange with other @entity7 officials on the day that the targeting story broke , @entity2 maintained that liberal groups may have been singled out by her department for added scrutiny			1
'' i ca n't confirm that there was anyone on the other side of the political spectrum , ' she said			0
' i think that sentence presumes that we keep track of which side of the aisle an [ organization ] falls -- we do n't			0
@entity2 claimed the @entity7 only knows that certain organizations involved were conservative because they have been ' very loud in the press			1
' ' i think that line is dangerous , ' she said , referring to @entity7 ' admission that it selected more conservative groups for additional scrutiny than it did progressive groups			1
in a follow - up email to her colleagues , @entity2 warned them that it ' does n't look good if it looks like we check to see what side of the aisle an org is on			2
' a series of emails in mid-april between @entity2 and other @entity7 officials , including former acting @entity7 commissioner @entity187 , who resigned after the scandal broke amid pressure from the @entity190 and @entity7 chief of staff @entity191 , show that the @entity7 tried to get out in front of the brewing scandal by slipping an apology into remarks @entity2 planned to give at a conference on april 25			1
after @entity2 suggested to @entity191 that she break the news in her speech , @entity191 brought the idea to @entity187 , who affirmed that the @entity7 ' may want to use it to burst a bubble			1
' @entity191 agreed that it may not be ' a terrible idea ' for her get their side of the story out and ' discuss the issue a bit			0
' a draft of the speech contained in the set of documents released by the @entity33 subcommittee on investigations shows that @entity2 planned to admit that the @entity7 ' tax - exempt division was unprepared in 2010 to handle the influx all of the applications from organizations that may be engaging in political behavior			1
@entity2 planned to admit that her team ' placed too much reliance on the particular name of an organization ' and specifically and specifically went after groups with the words ' tea party ' and ' patriot ' in the title			2
' [ @entity230 ] et me be clear			0
the @entity7 should have done a better job of handling the review of the c4 applications , ' she was supposed to say			0
' we made mistakes for which we deeply apologize			0
' but these mistakes were in no way due to any political or partisan reason			0
' @entity2 was to go on to say that missteps were made because of ' insufficient sensitivity to the implications of some of our decisions ' and explain how the tax - exempt has amended its practices			2
for undisclosed reasons , the section on the targeting and the @entity18 inspector 's related investigation never made it into @entity2 's remarks as delivered that day			2
a few days later , the @entity7 began circulating talking points on the tax - exempt division 's errant behavior , and on may 10 @entity2 apologized during the question and answer portion of a speech before the @entity261			1
she and the @entity7 have been the subject of congressional investigations ever since , including two ongoing reviews in the @entity265 being conducted by the @entity266 and the @entity267			0
republicans in the @entity190 are trying to determine if @entity2 's division acted on its own or if coordinated with the @entity190			0
they are also trying to find out if the @entity7 attempted to engage in a cover up of the inappropriate activity before government investigators got involved .			0

the emails shed light on the thinking of the @entity278 official - who has refused to testify before @entity78
@entity2 *adamantly* rejected the notion that conservative groups were targeting because of their political leanings
the emails also show that @entity7 discussed having @entity2 fess up to the targeting *scheme* before it hit the press to ' burst a bubble bubble '
