by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 05:57 est , 8 september 2012 a bride - to - be who was obsessed with having bronzed skin died in a sunbed salon only weeks after injecting herself with banned tanning drugs			1
@entity6 , 26 , collapsed inside a cubicle at the shop after telling friends she was ‘ very happy ’ with the unlicensed tanning products			1
it is believed she had bought a £ 25 kit containing melanotan off the internet three weeks earlier			1
tragic : fair - skinned @entity6 , centre , poses with friends on a night out celebrating her birthday			1
she died after taking illegal injections to get a better tan beauty conscious : miss @entity6 was keen to use sun beds to get a tan and online conversations suggest she was using controversial injections for darker skin this is a synthetic hormone which encourages the production of melanin , the pigment which turns the skin brown when exposed to sunlight			1
sales of the product are banned in the @entity33 but it is available online across @entity35 and @entity36			1
health watchdogs have warned the side effects can be ‘ extremely serious ’ and studies have linked the injections to heart problems , high blood pressure and immune system damage			1
miss @entity6 had gone for her regular sunbed session at the @entity46 salon near her home in @entity48 , @entity49 , on monday morning			1
after she failed to come out of the cubicle , the manager broke the door down to find her lying lifeless on the floor			2
she called 999 and tried to revive miss @entity6 , who was taken to hospital but declared dead soon after			1
a post-mortem examination has been carried out but the cause of death has not been established			2
it is not known if miss @entity6 , described by friends as a ‘ gorgeous , sweet girl ’ , injected the tanning product on the day of her death but she told friends she used it several weeks earlier			1
scene : the @entity68 salon in @entity48 where miss @entity6 collapsed on monday morning while topping up her tan			1
the shop is not linked to any illegal injections floral tributes outside the tanning shop left by devastated family			1
one read : ' to our darling daughter @entity75			2
you are going to be so sadly missed			2
good night @entity78 bless my sweet			2
love mum and @entity81 ' tribute : miss @entity6 is understood to have ordered the tanning injections because she wanted to have a darker more tanned appearance last night @entity86 ’ fiance , @entity85 , 26 , and mother @entity87 were too upset to comment			1
@entity89 injections have been nicknamed the ' barbie drug ' for their cosmetic appeal among beauty - conscious women			1
they come in two forms - @entity95 and melanotan @entity96 they both work by increasing the levels of melanin , a dark pigment that provides protection against the sun. having more levels of melanin gives a darker more tanned appearance when exposed to sun , either natural or artificial			0
both manmade drugs have undergone some limited clinical trials with some positive results for protecting against @entity111 damage			0
there are large numbers of websites selling the products and they have become a craze among tan obsessives , bodybuilders and even some men who take them for their sexual side - effetcs			2
however , health experts have made repeated warnings that products on the market are unlicensed and can have severe side - effects , ranging from nausea to headaches and other ' potentially dangerous ' unknown outcomes			0
the unlicensed drug is self injected , which means that there are serious needle safety issues to consider too			0
in a message posted on @entity135 , mrs @entity87 said : ‘ just can not believe you have gone , you was the best daughter , best friend			0
we had a great mother n daughter relationship any one would wish for , you are goin to be so very sadly missed			0
‘ i can not put into words how heartbroken i am			0
sleep tight the angels are lookin after you now			0
see you again one day and we will have a catch up , love you from the bottom of my heart bye for now my love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx			0
’ yesterday floral tributes were left outside the tanning salon and friends left messages on a @entity135 site set up in her memory			0
@entity156 , manager of @entity157 , said : ‘ what ’s happened is really upsetting			0
@entity75 used to come in here quite often to use the sun beds			0
‘ i knew she was using tanning injections – someone mentioned it – but she certainly did n’t get them from here			2
we do n’t sell them and i do n’t know anyone else who uses them			0
it ’s dangerous , because no one knows the side effects			0
’ an inquest was opened and adjourned into @entity86 ’ death yesterday			0
the @entity174 said melanotan is unlicensed and therefore illegal for sale in the @entity33			1
a spokesman said they had the power to take down websites and fine anyone caught selling it			0
they added : ‘ the @entity174 would warn people not to use this product			0
‘ it is unlicensed in the @entity33 and the side effects could be extremely serious			1
’ miss @entity6 and and fiance @entity188 pose together in a picture she posted online recently			1
she was engaged and soon to be married to him happy : miss @entity6 and mr @entity85 together before she died			1
the cause of death has not yet been established in 2009 , researchers at @entity195 @entity194 published an editorial in the @entity197 suggesting that use of melanotan ‘ could damage the immune and cardiovascular systems as well as triggering other problems ’			0
@entity201 , of the @entity202 , said it was ‘ worrying ’ that individuals routinely ignored warnings about tanning injections			2
he added : ‘ the fact that the @entity174 have yet to grant a licence to this product ought to serve as a warning to potential users			0
‘ there are other ways to get a tan without using an unregulated product or going on a sun bed			2
