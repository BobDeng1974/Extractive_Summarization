by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 6 august 2013 the plot of the 1941 @entity3 classic @entity4 revolves around a 12 - inch falcon statue which the film 's protagonist believes to be a priceless antique - but in the end is revealed to be a lead fake			1
so it 's ironic that the original film prop , an unremarkable lead falcon statue , is now expected to fetch a seven - figure sum at auction			1
the statue , a 50lb falcon complete with dents from when @entity3 dropped it on set , has been described by movie experts as one of the most important movie props of all time , up there with @entity27 's ruby slippers or @entity29 's little black dress			1
priceless : the worthless fake from the @entity3 classic @entity4 is now expected to fetch $ 1.5 million at auction in november like a hawk : @entity3 as @entity34 contemplates the falcon statue that will be auctioned in november cited as the first major film noir production , the film centers around @entity3 's character @entity34 , a private detective in @entity39 competing with three unscrupulous fly - by - nights in a quest to obtain a priceless jewel - encrusted falcon			1
@entity34 and the other characters pursuing the statue believe it 's been painted black to disguise its true worth , but at the film 's climax the falcon is revealed as a fake			2
classic : a poster from @entity4 , @entity3 's breakout film @entity55 , the director of entertainment memorabilia at @entity58 auction house told the @entity59 , ' this statue is the greatest film prop ever , not only because of its central role in the film but also because of what it symbolized			1
' in the last scene of the film , @entity3 ’s character @entity34 says the statue is ‘ the stuff dreams are made of ’ - and that summed up cinema at the time			1
' the real deal : the @entity74 is in possession of the bejeweled statuette believed to be the inspiration for the @entity3 film the falcon statue itself is said to be based on the @entity81 , a ceremonial pouring vessel made in 1697 for @entity83 , count of the @entity84			2
the real vessel is currently owned by the @entity74 and @entity86			0
only two falcon props were ever made for the film , which was described by @entity89 as one of the greatest films of all time			0
the one being auctioned has been displayed in various museums but never been part of a private collection			0
the other was auctioned off in 1994 for $ 398,500 to a private collector			0
the role that the falcon in the film is an example of a ' macguffin ' , a plot device that motivates the protagonist but has little relevance to the storyline			0
as interest in the 50lb lead falcon heats up , a line from the film seems fitting : ' i could n't be fonder of you if you were my own son , ' says one character to another			0
' but , well , if you lose a son , it 's possible to get another			0
there 's only one @entity4			2
' @entity58 will auction the statue in @entity120 in november .			2

the original prop from the @entity3 classic @entity4 is set to be auctioned
the lead statue has been called ' the most important prop in movie history '
it is expected to garner a seven - figure sum at auction in november
