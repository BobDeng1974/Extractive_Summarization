the @entity0 is just two days away and the excitement is reaching fever pitch			1
for the last time , our man in @entity5 , @entity3 , brings us the latest news and views from @entity8 - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the @entity0 is shaping up			1
what have @entity13 and @entity14 got in common ? one helped @entity17 win some @entity19 derbies while the other played for @entity17 in them ? cruel , accurate but not what we 're looking for			0
until thursday rolls around , they remain the only players to ever be part of a @entity5 @entity0 squad while also plying their trade in the @entity27 at the same time			1
that happened in 2s006 and 2010 respectively but it tells you just how changed and changed utterly the times are that on the eve of their tournament opener , the @entity34 manager 's dilemma is very much a @entity27 dilemma			1
@entity38 on tuesday delivered the kind of sharp - tongued rebuke that he may have been famed for in the past but has been a rare occurrence in recent times			1
so stint has his second stint in the job been to this point that he has n't needed to deliver a put - down to the press			2
in charge : @entity5 head coach @entity38 looks towards the cameras during a training session on monday but three days from tournament kick - off , he 'd had enough when he tackled the biggest talking point about his team head - on			1
' external pressures will not influence my decision of starting @entity59 ahead of @entity60 , ' he bristled ' @entity59 is the starter			1
' in one brief exchange he poured icy cold water on the hottest topic in the host nation			0
it was a debate that has raged even more wildly since friday 's final friendly against @entity67 when , just four days after a scoring cameo off the bench against @entity70 , @entity60 again was a difference - maker			1
replacing the fitful @entity59 at half - time , he gave @entity5 so much more impetus going forward			1
but then this is a six - month - old debate , one that is more familiar to @entity27 observers			2
as @entity59 struggled to hit his pre-christmas heights after the turn of the year , @entity60 was making @entity80 his own with increasing regularity , his transformation under @entity84 one of the manager 's finer achievements of last term			1
eye on the ball : @entity5 and @entity90 star @entity59 takes part in training in @entity93 on monday on form : @entity60 ( right ) caught the eye with his performance against @entity67 in a friendly last friday he carried that through to national team duty and continued to knock on the door while @entity59 struggled to look comfortable inside the room			1
but @entity38 knocked all that back on monday			2
it has always been thus with the man they call @entity38			2
his favourites are his favourites			0
and they just so happen to be the favourites			0
@entity38 was never likely to go for something as wild as taking a blunt implement to the starting xi he has cast in stone over the past 12 months			2
for the exact same reason , @entity60 is also not going to knock @entity112 out of the right side of the attacking midfield trio that operate behind @entity116			2
it all means that , barring any more scares like @entity120 's ankle roll that stopped a nation , the 11 who line up against @entity123 in @entity124 in less than 48 hours will be the same that started @entity5 's last competitive fixture - the @entity127 final romp over @entity129			1
panic : @entity120 receives medical attention after rolling his ankle during training but quickly recovered with @entity135 having jumped across the @entity136 to @entity137 , there will be two @entity27 starters in @entity59 and @entity140 ' @entity139 but there will be another three in reserve			1
the times have changed and so has @entity144 - but not too much			0
@entity60 probably did deserve his chance			0
but @entity38 was never for turning			0
he had his favourites in 2002 , look how that ended			0
and , no matter what , an out - of - sorts @entity59 is still a damn sight easier on the pre-match nerves than @entity151 was 12 years ago			2
team orders : @entity38 talks to his players as @entity5 prepare for their @entity0 opener against @entity123 good week : the tat vendors sitting in a @entity124 taxi for three hours - the perfect storm of a metro strike and a huge ' march for @entity157 ' religious extravaganza - gave us plenty of time for looking around on saturday			1
and what was finally visible was some @entity0 fervour			0
it 's been a long road to here for @entity5 and a lot of the footpaths are unfinished			2
but here they are , now hours away from a @entity0 on their doorstep and it seems that , in spite of the social ills that have and will continue to trouble the country , the nation is beginning to get in the spirit			0
the daredevils who sell @entity5 flags , whistles and horns not just street corners , but on the dividers in the middle of an eight - lane motorway have begun to reap the rewards			2
they should earn danger money too			0
roll up : an array of @entity5 memorabilia is available for sale in a souvenir shop in @entity124 ahead of the tournament bad week : @entity195 no one wants to hear journalists complain about getting in to football matches for free but when your view is so bad that play is blocked by a corner - flag , maybe a slight whinge is justified			2
had original plans come to fruition , thursday 's opening ceremony would have been held at @entity195 in @entity124 , the first choice for a @entity0 venue for @entity5 's biggest city			1
however authorities decided it was more practical to build the @entity210 from scratch ( shame they 're still building though )			0
the media men and commentators should be relieved however as @entity195 features undoubtedly the worst positioned press area we 've seen			0
lower than pitch level , stuck at the corner and cut off by a running track , we think we watched @entity5 play @entity67 on friday but we 're not quite sure			0
far away : this is the view of the pitch from the press box at the @entity195 in @entity124 restricted view : a camera crane blocks the view of the action between @entity5 and @entity67 on friday quote of the week : ' sadly , there â€™s a great deal of discrimination and racism , and this hurts me			0
' never mind the @entity233 or those @entity234 , @entity232 proves once more that it is he who has the biggest balls in the game - brass ones , undoubtedly - by accusing the @entity240 media of a plot to tarnish the @entity242			0
four more years ? really ? gesture : @entity244 president @entity232 stands next to the @entity0 trophy in @entity124 last week travellers ' tip : enjoy the daylight ! walking through @entity250 on monday evening we heard more than a few of the recently arrived ' gringos ' asking slightly bemused if ' it always gets this dark this early ' ? it is worth remembering again that it is winter in @entity5 so by 5.30pm it is pitch dark			1
so if fans want to take in all the sights of @entity5 's beaches , maybe sleeping in til early afternoon to shake off a caipirinha hangover is not the best policy			1
the place to be : the @entity250 beach is a popular spot but make sure you get there early @entity267 forecast : how 's the weather in @entity269 ? after five months of very long - range forecasts here at the blog from @entity5 , we finally know what the sciencey folks are predicting for game time			1
while scattered thunderstorms will greet the @entity278 upon arrival , by saturday it will be mostly sunny with highs of @entity281 and nighttime lows of @entity283 , humidity will peak at a sweat - tastic 84 %			0
rather ye than me lads			0
opener : @entity278 play @entity288 on saturday at the @entity290 stadium in @entity269			0

the selection of @entity90 team - mates @entity60 or @entity59 has been the biggest talking point about @entity38 's team
@entity38 has maintained that @entity59 will start against @entity123 in their @entity0 opener on thursday
the starting line - up will likely be the same as @entity5 's @entity127 win over @entity129
@entity59 and @entity140 's @entity139 will be @entity5 's two @entity27 starters
