@entity0 has launched a legal battle against his former financee @entity2 , to force her to return a £ 400,000 engagement ring he bought her as a spectacularly successful financier , billionaire @entity0 might be expected to show a generous side to the women in his life			1
but the hedge fund boss has launched an extraordinary legal battle against his former fiancee – to force her to return a £ 400,000 engagement ring he bought her			1
mr @entity0 , an @entity12 tycoon who once tried to buy @entity13 , has been branded ungallant for making the legal demands against @entity15 public relations executive @entity2 after their six - year relationship fell apart			1
‘ no one is particularly impressed at his asking for the ring back , said one friend			0
‘ it ’s hardly what you would call chivalrous			0
and it ’s not like he needs the money			0
’ mr @entity0 met ms @entity2 in 2007 and proposed a few months later , but the relationship is said to have soured after she discovered that he had been pictured holidaying with a @entity29 model			1
friends of ms @entity2 say the couple had another furious row last year and she called off the engagement and moved out of his £ 8 million @entity35 home			1
it is understood that mr @entity0 , 60 , disputes this and insists he ended it			1
with both sides refusing to yield , the extraordinary dispute over the ring is now destined for the @entity42 in @entity43 – and at its heart will be the question of where the financier proposed			0
if it was in @entity43 , as mr @entity0 claims , then he might have a case , although not a strong one			2
but if it can be shown that he gave her the ring outside of the @entity12 , the law will favour ms @entity2			1
in @entity55 , for instance , an engagement ring is classed as a gift and always remains the property of the recipient			1
mr @entity60 ’s lawyers made clear their demands in a forceful letter to ms @entity2 in october			2
in it , they set a deadline by which the ring should be returned , though that is now thought to have passed			0
matrimonial law expert @entity67 , a senior partner at @entity68 in @entity35 , said : ‘ i have never come across a case like this , it is astonishing			0
‘ he sounds like a very bitter man			0
it might be an option for her to forestall any action in the @entity12 by bringing an action here against him under the @entity80			2
‘ i believe that part of the purpose of an engagement ring , historically , was to provide security for the bride - to - be			1
if the engagement was broken off , particularly if it was broken off by the man , it served as financial compensation			0
’ mr @entity0 is the co-founder of the @entity89 , the @entity43 and @entity35 based private equity firm			2
before that he was said to have played a pivotal role in building the asset management firm @entity92			0
in the book @entity94 : @entity96 , dollar billionaire @entity0 is described as a ‘ suave , sophisticated , energetic international financier with extravagant tastes and slicked - back jet - black hair ’ it describes how he sent luxury @entity102 sheets by @entity104 to his hotel rooms ahead of his arrival and always travelled with his personal gourmet chef			2
privately - educated ms @entity2 , who grew up in @entity108 , was newly single when she first met mr @entity0 having been previously married to another financier			1
her friends say she has so far ignored the ‘ shocking ’ legal demand to return the ring			2
however she has been warned by her solicitor that should the claim be approved in the @entity12 courts she could be barred from entering the country by customs			2
it is understood the ring cost £ 250,000 but was valued last year at £ 400,000			0
@entity0 ( left ) and his former financee @entity2 , ( right ) split after six years together contacted yesterday , ms @entity2 refused to discuss the dispute , although a friend said ‘ @entity126 was deeply in love with @entity0 and had hoped that he would eventually grow up			1
but it seems she ran out of patience with him			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity0 , who counts former @entity133 president @entity132 and former @entity12 president @entity134 among his friends , also declined to comment			1
in the @entity12 , disputes over engagement rings are not uncommon and most states have laws governing ownership			1
many states consider the ring a ‘ conditional gift ’ until the wedding day			0
this means that regardless of who might pull out , the ring must be returned			0
a @entity43 judge ruled in 2006 that a woman could keep her diamond engagement ring because her fiance was not divorced from his previous wife when he proposed			1
in certain states , determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding			0
and some states treat a ring given on a birthday , @entity161 or @entity160 as an unconditional gift .			0
