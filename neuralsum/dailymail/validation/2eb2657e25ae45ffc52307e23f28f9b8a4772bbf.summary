@entity0 will name @entity1 in a @entity3 squad for the first time in a year on wednesday - and believes that allows @entity6 to spell more danger for his country			1
@entity9 has not featured for @entity3 since scoring in a 3 - 1 victory over @entity11 last march as he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament three weeks after that @entity15 friendly			0
but striker @entity1 has been a regular off the @entity17 bench since @entity18 and started his first @entity20 game on saturday when the @entity17 shocked @entity21 to win 1 - 0 at @entity22			1
@entity17 striker @entity1 has earned a call up to the @entity3 squad after impressing for the @entity17 @entity1 ( right ) scored on his second appearance back from injury during his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity29 that has convinced @entity0 he is ready to play some part in the crunch @entity33 against @entity34 on march 28 and free @entity6 again to cause maximum damage in @entity36			1
' he obviously missed the start of the season after his injury but he 's had some games and minutes under his belt now , ' said @entity0			2
' it 's good for us because @entity1 gives us something different			2
' he 's not just a big target man , he 's got a bit more to him than that and it will be good to have the big man back ' maybe he can come on for half an hour or play for an hour if he starts because defenders do n't like playing against that very strong and brave forward who can get a goal			0
' @entity1 ' return also spells good news for @entity0 as far as the deployment of @entity6 is concerned , especially as his main man ended his nine - game scoring drought on sunday by scoring both goals in @entity61 's 2 - 0 league victory over @entity62			1
@entity6 has often had to plough a lone furrow in @entity1 ' absence rather than causing mayhem when cutting in from either flank			1
@entity6 , pictured after scoring against @entity67 , has led @entity3 ' forward line in the absence of @entity1 the @entity61 superstar scored twice in @entity3 ' opening 2 - 1 @entity72 win in @entity67 in september to make it 11 goals in his last 16 international appearances but he has not found the net in the three qualifiers since			1
' maybe we can now release @entity6 somewhere else , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity6 's been up there by himself because in the last camp @entity80 was also injured and he 's had a job to do for us			2
' but we can look at it with another angle with big @entity1 coming back			0
' @entity0 's side head to @entity36 with themselves and @entity34 the surprise early front - runners in @entity87 and fancied pair @entity88 and @entity90 having ground to make up in the section			2
group leaders @entity34 have won their opening three games while unbeaten @entity3 lie in second place after beating @entity67 and @entity99 and picking up points against @entity88 and @entity90			0
@entity3 boss @entity0 is hoping @entity1 ' return will allow @entity6 to return to his natural role @entity0 has hit on a settled side and he hopes he will be able to call on @entity105 defender @entity104 , who has been out of action since dislocating a shoulder in january			1
@entity108 has been a revelation since joining the set - up last year and has developed a formidable centre - back pairing alongside captain @entity112 , with @entity3 conceding only twice in four qualification games so far			0
' it will be touch - and - go for @entity104 and he 's done brilliant for us , ' @entity0 said			0
' but we 're lucky we 've got someone of @entity118 ' experience to come in			0
' he 's got the type of mentality to go to a place like @entity34 where it will be heated and front it up and lead			0
' it 's going to be tough because they 're top on merit but if we 're serious about qualifying we 've got to go there and get something			0

@entity17 's @entity1 will be named in @entity3 squad for first time in year
@entity1 impressed for @entity17 in their shock win against @entity21
@entity3 boss @entity0 hopes @entity1 ' return will free up @entity6
