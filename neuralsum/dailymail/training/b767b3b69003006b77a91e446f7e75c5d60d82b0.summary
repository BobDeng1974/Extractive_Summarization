by @entity0 if you happen to be a girl , as well as your parents ’ firstborn child , then congratulations – you ’re in good company			1
because according to a study , it ’s no coincidence that some of the world ’s most powerful women fall into that category			1
the research shows that firstborn girls are statistically more likely to be the most highly qualified of all their family			2
they are 13 per cent more ambitious then firstborn sons , according to a study conducted by the @entity18			1
successful : both novelist @entity19 and singer @entity20 are firstborn children so @entity19 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity20 – all the eldest children in their families – were born with a greater chance of becoming high achievers			1
and while all eldest children are 16 per cent more likely to attend further education than their younger siblings , girls are 4 per cent more likely to have better qualifications			1
but firstborn boys – such as @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 – were next in line for success			0
lead researcher @entity39 said : ‘ there are several possible explanations for the higher attainment and ambition of the eldest			2
@entity44 , @entity22 ( left ) , @entity23 ( right ) , @entity19 and @entity20 were all firstborn children ‘ it could be that the parents simply devote more time and energy to them – it could be they are actually more intelligent			1
for me , i tend to lean towards the theory that parental investment is possibly at work here			0
’ the report – sibling configurations , @entity55 and @entity56 – followed 1,503 sibling groups and 3,532 individuals through the @entity60 and its successor , @entity62			0
@entity39 , who led the study , at the @entity18 even taking into account the parents ’ education and professional status , the study found firstborn children were still 7 per cent more likely to aspire to stay on in education than younger siblings			1
more than half of all @entity74 prizewinners and @entity76 presidents have been firstborns			2
the study looked at gender mix among siblings as well as the size of families – excluding twins and only children – and found there was no evidence that the sex of a second sibling made any difference to their level of aspiration			2
however , it did discover that leaving an age gap of at least four years between siblings could improve the younger children ’s levels of educational attainment			0
miss @entity39 told @entity99 : ‘ i would say that the larger the age gap between the children , the better their qualifications will be			0
‘ it is interesting that we observe a distinct firstborn advantage in education , even though parents in modern society are more likely to be egalitarian in the way they treat their children			0
’ she added : ‘ i ’m the firstborn , of course			0
that is why i ’m doing a phd			0

@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity19 and @entity20 are all firstborns
