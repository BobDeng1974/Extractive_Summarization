with @entity1 holding a fragile 1 - 0 lead over @entity3 in the @entity4 , it was not the time for any player from the @entity8 side to try anything flamboyant in front of goal			1
unfortunately , that is exactly what @entity13 did when he seized control of a penalty for his side			0
instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper , he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick			2
@entity13 chips a penalty at goal in @entity1 's @entity4 game against @entity3 @entity13 's contact with the ball was so light it only trickled to goal , despite the goalkeeper diving the wrong way the goalkeeper had enough time to get to his feet and save the attempt , so minimal was @entity13 's contact as the ball was stopped inches in front of the goal line , @entity13 reacts to his error for @entity1 @entity44 substituted and his @entity1 side drew to @entity3 1 - 1 before losing the game on penalties the skill is named after @entity50 's penalty at @entity51 for @entity52 against @entity53 but @entity13 lacked all of the conviction that made @entity50 's kick famous			1
his kick was so feeble and light that the @entity3 goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way , regain his balance and claim the ball before it trickled over the line			0
and things did not get any better for @entity13 or @entity1			0
@entity66 midfielder @entity65 famously scored a panenka penalty against @entity68 at @entity69 he was substituted , @entity1 ended up drawing 1 - 1 before crashing out of the competition - on penalties			1
the panenka has been replicated by the likes of @entity65 and @entity73 , but @entity13 is unlikely to want to try it in an important game any time soon .			0

@entity13 missed a panenka penalty for @entity1 's *youth* team
he *underhit* the penalty so much the goalkeeper had time to dive twice
@entity1 *eventually* lost the match on penalties to @entity3
