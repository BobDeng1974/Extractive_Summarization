@entity0 insisted he was ' relaxed ' about the idea of publishing his tax returns but chancellor @entity12 says there are ' no plans ' to do so mr @entity0 and other members of the coalition have faced intense pressure to say whether they benefited from a decision in the @entity26 to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p			1
two years ago @entity29 said senior @entity30 were willing to publish their tax returns , but stressed the election was a long way off			1

there are no plans at this point			0
the income i receive is publicly declared			0
' speaking at an event in @entity56 today , mr @entity0 , who earns £ 142,500 a year said : ' on the issue of my tax returns , nothing has changed			1
i am very relaxed about publishing these things			2
