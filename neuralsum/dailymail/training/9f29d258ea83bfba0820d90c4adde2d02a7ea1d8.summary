fashion brand @entity0 are offering a 1 pence pair of shoes with free delivery for 1 day only on friday 23rd november stocks of 500 are expected to sell fast and the store will not be re-stocking by @entity7 published : 02:59 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 23 november 2012 first came the 99p party dress from @entity9 then @entity10 tried to better it by offering the 1p party dress for fashionistas on a tight budget			1
although seemingly ridiculously cheap , both items came with a minimum delivery price of £ 7.95			0
now one company has gone even further in their quest to offer the best bargain by unveiling the 1 penny party shoe with free delivery			1
the diamante studded black and nude stilettos are only 1 penny and have no delivery fee @entity26 based fashion brand @entity0 say they are going ‘ @entity33 ’ and are celebrating @entity28 , the day after @entity29 synonymous in the @entity30 with mega discounts , with a ' practically priceless party offer '			1
for just one day only , the nude and black diamante - studded stilettos will be slashed from their original price of £ 24.99 to just a penny , with free @entity26 delivery			1
the company describe this as ' the best offer in the @entity41 ' and have a limited amount of 500 shoes up for grabs ( although only one pair can be purchased per customer )			2
the brand are likely to be hoping for the same result that online fashion retailer @entity9 experienced when they led the way with the 99p party dress			2
it was a huge @entity52 success with 300 dresses sold in just 15 minutes and 100,000 new visitors to the site over one weekend			0
although the company lost money on every dress sold , the amount of increased traffic to the site and subsequent sales of other items meant the style stunt was a huge commercial success too			0
first came the 99p party dress ( @entity67 ) followed by the 1p party outfit but both had hefty delivery costs speaking about the cut - price offer , @entity73 , head of marketing at @entity74 said : ' with 50 per cent of @entity75 planning to cut back on spending this @entity76 the ‘ @entity78 ’ offer gives our customers the chance to treat themselves , without dipping into their present budget			0
' and with the shopping madness of @entity28 looming in the @entity30 , we thought it was the perfect time to launch such an amazing offer			0
' the offer will run online only from 9am - 12 midnight on friday 23rd november 2012			1
whatever next ? the 1p wardrobe ?			0
