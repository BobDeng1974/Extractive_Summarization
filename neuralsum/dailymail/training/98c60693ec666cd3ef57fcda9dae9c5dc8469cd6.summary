dr @entity0 , presenter of @entity1 's weighing up the enemy explores whether more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery more obese people should be given gastric bands on the @entity7 to save the health service millions in the future , a doctor has said			1
one in four adults and one in five children in the @entity12 are obese			1
countless studies have found carrying extra weight puts a person at significantly greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes , suffering heart problems , cancer and stroke			1
experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the @entity7 around £ 6 billion every year			1
last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the @entity7			1
but that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit , experts say			2
dr @entity0 , presenter of @entity1 's weighing up @entity29 , will tomorrow explore the question of whether it makes economic sense to offer gastric bands , and bypass operations to more obese people			1
he argues that rather than lumbering the taxpayer with a hefty bill , the surgery could in fact save the @entity7 millions in the future			1
the @entity41 website reveals gastric band operations cost between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000 at private clinics			1
and gastric bypass surgery costs the @entity7 between £ 9,500 to £ 15,000			1
the @entity1 show follows patient @entity47 's journey as she is admitted to @entity49 's @entity48 for a gastric band operation			1
the 62 - year - old weighs more than 21 stone and relies on carers to help her go about her day - to - day life			2
speaking to the experts caring for @entity47 , dr @entity0 questions whether the operation makes financial sense for the @entity7			1
' and it 's not even that , if you think of the social care side as well , @entity47 has carers , but if she 's able to be more independent in everyday life , that 's a saving in itself			0
' but bariatric surgery is not without risks			0
complications include internal bleeding , respiratory problems and post-operative infections			0
weight loss surgeon @entity78 , who works at @entity49 's @entity48 , said despite those risks , the financial benefits of bariatric surgery would be seen to the @entity7 within a year for many patients			1
' bariatric surgery is high risk because of the nature of the surgery , in and around the top of the stomach , its a a very tricky area to operate , ' he said			0
' this operation will cost the taxpayer around £ 5,000 all in			1
with gastric band and bypass operations costing the taxpayer around £ 5,000 some experts have argued it would save the @entity7 money in the long term , with obesity related illnesses , such as type 2 diabetes , heart disease and cancer costing around £ 6 billion each year in the @entity12 ( file picture ) weight loss surgery , also known as bariatric surgery , is currently used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese			1
it is only permitted on the @entity7 in cases where an obese patient has made lifestyle changes but failed			1
being dangerously obese , means a person 's life is at risk			2
it is defined as having a body mass index ( @entity115 ) of 40 or above			0
having a @entity115 of 35 or above and having another serious health condition , which could be improved by losing weight , such as type 2 diabetes , is also considered a dangerous level of obesity			1
the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) is currently considering whether to lower the threshold for weight loss surgery to a @entity115 of more than 30 for those recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes			1
the two most widely used types of weight loss surgery are gastric band operations and gastric bypass procedures			1
gastric bands work to reduce the size of the stomach , meaning a smaller amount of food is needed to make a person feel full			2
gastric bypasses are where the digestive system is re-routed past the majority of a person 's stomach			2
it means a person digests less food , and it takes much less food to satisfy hunger pangs			0
weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results but is not a magic cure for obesity			2
patients have to stick to a rigorous , life - long plan , including a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise , to avoid gaining weight			1
' if her costs are £ 15,000 it will pay for itself before the year is up			1
' we would n't be wasting taxpayers money doing this operation if it was n't worth it and did n't work out cost effective in the end			2
' another gastric band patient @entity166 , who weighed 25 stone at her heaviest , told dr @entity0 the surgery has changed her life			1
' outside of having children it is definitely the best thing i have ever done , ' she said			0
' it has been life - changing			0
' basically i could n't walk very far , i was diabetic , had ibs and mild sleep apnoea , but they have all cleared up now			0
' dr @entity0 said : ' bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics			0
' it is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future			2
' @entity190 , spokesman for the @entity191 , agreed that more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery			0
' bariatric surgery , for a long time seen by the populus at large as a very expensive , wasteful @entity7 treatment , actually should be seen as a good investment for the future , ' he told @entity200			1
' the reason being simply cutting the stomach of obese people in half , reducing it to normal size , means an individual is much less likely to acquire diabetes , cardiovascular problems			2
' they require far more expensive treatment for longer			0
' the literature says within two to three years , bariatric surgery pays for itself			0
' but he said , the problem lies with the way @entity7 budgets are worked out , accusing accountants for not seeing the potential of the bigger picture			2
dr @entity0 , said : ' bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics			0
it is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future ' ' the real problem is that as far as the @entity7 is concerned the people who pay for these operations are not necessarily the same people who reap the financial rewards , ' he said			1
' there should be a budget for bariatric surgery , the benefits of which would spread to other budgets later in life			0
' the big picture is that this surgery is well worth it for the @entity7 , there are no two ways about it			2
' but weight loss expert , @entity253 , presenter of @entity255 's @entity254 , disagreed			0
he said the money could be ' better spent on cancer care and terminal illness '			0
mr @entity253 told @entity200 that people who need to lose weight can do something of their own accord			0
' if we go down this path we will be paying for cosmetic surgery for people claiming their face is too saggy and it 's causing depression , ' he said			0
' we need to motivate our nation to own their body			0
' motivation is not just about carrot , it is about stick			0
we require stronger warning measures , penalties for not managing weight , and as a society we need to discuss other options to help reduce weight loss , such as hypnosis			0
' we do n't have the money in the bank to pay for such surgery			0
the @entity7 is struggling and we can not be promoting the message " do n't worry if you get too fat , we will give you free surgery "			2
' weighing up the enemy is on @entity1 at 8pm tomorrow .			0

one in four adults and one in five children in the @entity12 are obese
