by @entity0 gift : the 40 - year - old schizophrenic , who believes he is a prophet , fought his mother in a legal battle to let him donate a tenth of his inheritance to the @entity7 a delusional man who believed he was a prophet has been given free reign to donate nearly £ 7,000 to the @entity7 by the @entity10 - against the wishes of his family			1
the mother of the schizophrenic had been fighting to block her ' vulnerable ' 40 - year - old son from making a ' tithe ' , an @entity18 concept ordering @entity19 to donate 10 per cent of their earnings to the @entity7			1
but today , district judge @entity21 ruled there was ' no reason ' to stop the man doing as he pleased			1
the unidentified donor told the court : ' i simply wish to abide by the @entity18 principle of giving a 10 per cent tithe			1
this is standard practice in my church ; not me being exploited			0
' generally , i wish to enjoy the right of obeying my church 's teachings on financial matters			2
with regards to my financial affairs , my decision to give a tithe to my church is both rational and @entity39			2
' the man had said he had given a tithe of around £ 1,600 to the @entity7 about a decade ago when he was ' well ' adding : ' i had been tithing since early 2004 when i discovered the verse in which members of my church are commanded to start tithing in this way			2
' according to @entity47 , the man 's mother told the court that she was ' surprised and distressed ' by the case			1
' we have no idea how much pressure is put upon [ him ] by his church to donate or tithe his money , ' she said			0
' i am personally strongly opposed to [ him ] being permitted to make a donation of this size			0
' psychiatrists disagreed about the man 's ' capacity ' to make the gift , judge @entity21 revealed			1
one said the man had the capacity to ' make a gift on the tithes principle '			1
distress : his mother told the secret court her son was too vulnerable to decide for himself			2
he intends to make a ' tithe ' , an @entity18 idea where @entity19 donate 10 per cent of their wealth to the church another said the man was making the request in the context of his ' psychotic illness ' and ' delusional ideas regarding religion ' and the request should be ' disallowed '			1
judge @entity21 concluded that the man had an ' impairment ' of the mind and a ' delusional belief ' that he was a prophet			2
@entity18 law required @entity19 to ' tithe ' , where they offer 10 per cent of everything they earn to the @entity7			1
advocating multiple tithes , it often ended up being around 25 per cent			0
it is believed by many to have been invented as a tax to subsidise priests ' income			0
it was never advocated in the @entity99			0
today , mormons are still required to tithe to achieve salvation			0
@entity102 in some countries are also required to tithe , although churches now recommend a donation of around three per cent			0
but he said : ' although , on the evidence , i have accepted that his belief that he is a prophet is a delusional belief , that does not mean that all of his religious beliefs are delusional or compromised by the presence of mental illness			0
' the fact that a person has a grandiose belief with a religious content does not demonstrate that the whole of their religion is delusionally - based and caused by mental illness			0
' he added : ' in what way , therefore , does his belief that it is necessary or appropriate to give a tithe stem directly from his delusion that he is a prophet or constitute an extension of it ? ' judge @entity21 said the fact that relatively few people tithe now was ' neither here nor there ' and it was not enough that others thought the proposed tithe ' unwise ' , a ' misinterpretation of a religious text ' or ' misguided '			2
but the judge said it was relevant that the man 's belief was a ' matter of faith '			1
' it can not be demonstrated that [ his ] desire to give this money to the @entity7 is part of his delusional belief system , ' judge @entity21 concluded			0
although psychiatrists disagreed about the man 's ' capacity ' , judge @entity21 ruled in the man 's favour ' the issue is finely balanced			1
in my view , the presumption of capacity has not been displaced			0
' the judge added : ' his belief that he is a prophet does not impinge on his capacity to argue and present his case with regard to the tithe and the other litigation issues			2
he has prepared and presented his case very ably and i can not identify any point of substance in support of his position that he has not articulated			0
' judge @entity21 said he had noted the man 's mother 's ' strong opposition ' and her ' sincere concern ' for his welfare			1
but the judge said her objections were of ' limited assistance ' in determining the man 's ' capacity and best interests '			1
and he said there was no evidence that ' pressure had been applied ' by the church .			0
