@entity0 , 20 , could be earning mega dollars as a model in the @entity3 , instead she earns about $ 500 a week for the dubious privilege of waking at 4 o'clock most mornings to ride 500 kilograms of horse flesh at a speed of more than 70 kilometres an hour around a dark race track			1
all in the hope that one day she will be star of the ' big show ' - the @entity11			1
' yes , i actually got a contract from @entity3 for a modelling career but i turned that down , it was either that or be a jockey and i always wanted to be a jockey , ' she told @entity19			1
' i definitely do n't regret my decision at all , i 'm living the dream			1
' a dream which turned into a nightmare on may 19 , 2012 - an horrific fall which could have cost her more than just a riding career			1
@entity0 came crashing down from her mount , deliver @entity27 , in a @entity28 at @entity29			1
' it was a difficult time but i 'm very glad that i just ca n't remember it , ' she said			2
' looking back on it , though , it was such a heavy fall so i was very , very lucky			1
' but having had her life on the line ' does n't really faze me '			2
' it would be a lot different if i remembered it , i guess			2
' on further reflection , still no regrets			2
' there was definitely no looking back though , as soon as i woke from my coma i said to my mum , " when 's my next ride ? what 's happening to all my horses " , there was never any concern about getting back in the saddle , ' she said			1
' all that time out really made me appreciate what i get to do for a job			0
' she 's more determined than ever to get to the top and her competitive streak led to a suspension which ends on @entity73			0
. and she ca n't wait			0
' i have one ride that day , on @entity75 ( in the @entity76 ) , i 'm really looking forward to being out there , ' she added			0
no glitz and glam for this apprentice though - she 'll earn $ 180 for her day 's work			1
@entity0 calls her riding career ' living the dream ' but it turned into a nightmare on may 19 , 2012 - when she suffered an horrific fall which could have cost her more than just her job as a jockey 4am starts are ' just part of the job ' according to @entity0			1
here she 's pictured at a relatively quiet @entity29 carrying out trackwork during the @entity11 week			1
she 's back from suspension on thursday , @entity73 an apprentice is on a basic salary of barely $ 500 a week but @entity0 loves the game too much to worry about money matters or possing getting hurt again			1
' i have had my bad fall and hopefully that 's it for me			1
you do n't go out there thinking that i 'm going to die or anything like that which definitely can happen as we know with poor @entity103 ( @entity104 ) and @entity105 up in @entity106 , ' she said			0
' it 's something that we love doing and we do n't think about it if you do start thinking along those lines than you 're better off not doing it			1
' definitely this is one of the most dangerous things anyone can do anywhere in the world , it 's the only job where an ambulance follows you around all day , after all			0
' if it 's not risking their life each time they get legged aboard a thoroughbred , then weight is always an issue , for any jockey , female or male			2
' it 's definitely a struggle it 's hard to always try and think what you are putting in your mouth and what you will have to do to work that off , ' she said			0
' it can be hard at times , not getting to go out and enjoy yourself but it 's something you have to sacrifice			0
' the champion apprentice suffered a fractured spine , spleen damage , broken cheekbone , was put in a coma for four days and spent nine months on the sideline recovering @entity0 says she is ' living the dream ' and that time out of the sport made her really appreciate what she gets to do for a job the 4am starts began for @entity0 as a 14 - year - old and she began riding in races at 16			1
' it 's in my blood , i love it			2
i actually rode my first racehorse when i was two years old , ' she said			2
' i was always around the horses			0
i have always wanted to be a jockey			2
' her claim that it 's in the blood is no idle boast			0
parents , @entity164 and @entity165 , were both jockeys as was her grandfather , @entity166 and her brother @entity167			0
the early mornings , she insists , is something she grew up with in the @entity172 house - hold			1
' i even remember when i was out for nine months with my broken back and i would always wake up early and i could n't get back to sleep , my body clock is trained now , that 's just the way it is			1
' other dreams must go too			0
not only did the champion @entity182 apprentice happily forgo a lucrative modelling offer in the bright lights of @entity185 , her other sporting pursuits have gone by the wayside			1
' i played basketball for eight years and netball for four years and really got into them , i was going to pursue basketball but had to give up that and focus on race riding , ' she said			2
@entity0 looks on as @entity193 is assisted by medical staff after falling from his mount , @entity196 , in race eight at the @entity198 at @entity29 on may 7 , 2011 in @entity199 @entity0 has three rides on the last day of the carnival , @entity200 but will be on track today for the race that stops a nation @entity0 has three rides on the last day of the carnival , @entity200 but will be on track today for the race that stops a nation			1
' i will actually go to the @entity11 and watch @entity211 ( her partner ) in the @entity11 and hopefully he can win it			0
' ' the public do n't get a chance to see everything we do ( behind the scenes ) and the extent of it and the danger factor , ' she said			0
' when i was growing up i would tell all my friends that i was going to the races in the middle of winter and they would be like " what races , they only race in @entity229 " , but people seem to have a better understanding of what we do			0
' and she is making quite the impact			0
a champion apprentice already , with almost 20 city winners under her belt and a better strike rate ( winners to runners ) than established riding superstars like @entity243 and @entity244			2
with one eye already on @entity29 for @entity246 she says that 's it really is the best carnival and they are the best horses			0
' i want to be the best			0
i 've still got a long way to go but i do want to be the best '			0
and you would n't bet against it .			0

@entity0 turned down a modelling career in the @entity3 to be a jockey
20 - year - old had an horrific fall in may 2012 which almost cost her career
she suffered a fractured spine , spleen damage and broken cheekbone
in a coma for four days - then she spent nine months on the sideline
back on the horse - the 4am starts began when she was just 14 - years - old
