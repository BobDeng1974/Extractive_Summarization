@entity1 chairman @entity0 claims the return of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 to the @entity6 can not come soon enough			1
speaking after the @entity8 club did a deal to wipe out their £ 14.5 million debt at their agm on monday night , @entity0 claimed it would be easier to attract sponsors to the flagship league with the biggest clubs there			1
@entity1 ’s turnover for last season was up to £ 11.158m from £ 7.85m the previous year but they still made a small operating loss			1
@entity1 chairman @entity0 wants to see the return of the @entity22 heavyweights to the @entity6 and , in an eyebrow - raising claim , the @entity1 chief insists most @entity1 fans want a resumption of their bitter rivalry with @entity3 after a period he describes as the most challenging in @entity22 football history			1
‘ we all want to see @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity4 back up in the top league again and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ without any question it would be easier to attract significant sponsorship back to our game with these clubs in the @entity6			1
‘ there ’s no doubt that it makes the game an easier sell if we have all the major clubs competing in the same division			1
@entity3 confirmed on monday that manager @entity44 had resigned from the club ‘ some fans like seeing big teams struggling , but i think the majority want to see their team going to @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 again			0
‘ i ’m sure our supporters want to see @entity3 back at @entity8 after what has been the most challenging period in @entity22 football ’s history in the last few years			2
it ’s happened at a time when it ’s been the most challenging time economically for the country as a whole which has put additional strain on the clubs			1
‘ i think there is a bit of stability in the game lately and we can be hopeful about things moving forward			0
’ at the recent @entity71 in @entity72 , sports promoter @entity70 launched a verbal attack on the @entity6 hierarchy for their failure to land blue chip sponsors			2
championship leaders @entity4 are progressing well both on and off the pitch defending league figureheads , however , @entity0 said : ‘ people have to put in context what @entity70 said recently as it is always easy for someone to fly in and make statements , then fly off again			1
‘ it ’s a totally different thing to live with it and make things happen in a tough environment			0
‘ there will be pressures on in the months ahead to do whatever we can to bring more money into the game at a national level , as well as at the individual clubs			0
but having those big teams back in the top flight would certainly be a help towards that			0
’ @entity0 used the @entity12 to promise progress on a new training complex for the club			1
plans for a new stadium at @entity105 will be also be revived			0
as the @entity3 future of @entity44 hangs in the balance , however , @entity0 also vowed to do his utmost to hang on to @entity110 - winning manager @entity109			1
‘ we have achieved a lot lately and the major factor in that has been the impact @entity116 has made since coming into the club , ’ he said			0
@entity5 chief executive @entity118 says a deal to put the club in the black is not close ‘ what happens on the pitch gives us momentum and is the driving force for everything else			0
‘ a lot of the groundwork for our plans was done a while back but not doing as much as a club like @entity1 needs to be doing on the pitch makes it extremely difficult			2
‘ but it ’s part and parcel of football that a successful manager will attract attention from elsewhere and we know we have to work hard to keep @entity116 here			2
‘ however , i think that @entity116 would be the first to admit that when he took on the job he was taking on a big task			0
‘ he was n’t coming in to be a one or two - year wonder as he has just started something at @entity1			2
‘ we made really good progress on that journey in the last 18 months but he knows there is still a long way to go			0
‘ i have no reason not to believe anything other than the fact that @entity116 has every intention of seeing that through			0
‘ there are a whole new set of opportunities for everyone at the club and as a board we have to do what we can to help the manager keep making that progress to where we want to be			0
