by @entity0 published : 00:23 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 11:23 est , 21 september 2012 @entity1 was peppered with tough questions on his failures as president on thursday night as he took part in a candidate forum			1
addressing a large @entity8 television audience , the president said his ' biggest failure ' was an inability to win an overhaul of the immigration system			2
but he took swipes at his opponent @entity14 , saying the @entity16 candidate has n’t ' gotten around a lot ' if he believes that 47 per cent of @entity18 consider themselves victims and entitled to government help			1
@entity1 said @entity18 pay payroll taxes , gas taxes and state and sales taxes			1
he noted that those who do n’t pay income taxes include workers who do n’t make enough money to qualify , older @entity18 and students			2
' when you express an attitude that half the country considers itself victims , that somehow they want to be dependent on government , my thinking is maybe you have n’t gotten around a lot , ' @entity1 said during an interview with @entity58 language channel @entity27			1
the president later referenced the issue at a @entity62 fundraiser , telling supporters he did n’t want his daughters and other young people to think ' that somehow half of the country is locked out ' of pursuing success			0
taking the blame : @entity1 admitted he had not kept his promise on immigration reform but said that it was n't for lack of trying ' i want everybody to be successful			1
@entity75 , white , @entity77 , @entity76 , @entity78 , gay , straight , able or disabled , i want everybody to have a chance to succeed , ' @entity1 said			2
the forum earlier in the day on the campus of the @entity30 gave @entity1 a rebuttal of sorts			2
@entity14 spoke on wednesday at the @entity27 forum , where he said his campaign was about ' the 100 per cent in @entity18 '			1
@entity1 , who ran on a message of changing the partisan tone in @entity90 , said he had come to the conclusion that ' you ca n’t change @entity90 from the inside			1
you can only change it from the outside '			0
he went on to say that what he had accomplished since taking office was due to mobilizing ' the @entity18 people to speak out '			2
' so something that i ’d really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the @entity18 people so that they can put pressure on @entity105 to help move some of these issues forward , ' he said			0
all smiles : @entity1 reassured the largely @entity8 audience that he was still the right man for the top job in @entity90 @entity14 seized on the remarks to say that @entity1 had surrendered in the face of a broken @entity90 and major challenges			1
' he said he ca n’t change @entity90 from inside			0
he can only change it from outside , ' @entity14 told supporters in @entity115 , @entity116			0
' i can change @entity90			0
we ’ll get the job done from the inside - republicans and @entity121 will come together			0
he ca n’t do it			0
his slogan was " yes , we can			0
" his slogan now is " no , i ca n’t			0
" ' this is time for a new president			0
' the president faced tough questions on why he had n’t accomplished comprehensive immigration reform , an important issue for @entity77 voters			1
@entity28 , one of the moderators , put it bluntly : ' you promised that and a promise is a promise and with all due respect , you did n’t keep that promise			0
' @entity1 said he accepted responsibility but that he faced an economy ' on the verge of collapse ' in his first year and blamed @entity16 for abandoning support for comprehensive immigration reform			1
what will @entity143 say ? @entity1 pigged out on french fries during a campaign stop at @entity147 ! burgers in @entity149 on thursday sneaking one : the @entity151 has spent much of her time in the @entity152 campaigning against junk food like french fries he said there was ' the thinking that the president is somebody who is all - powerful and can get everything done '			2
' what i confess i did not expect , and so i ’m happy to take responsibility for being naive here , is that @entity16 who had previously supported comprehensive immigration reform , my opponent in 2008 who had been a champion of it and who attended these meetings , suddenly would walk away , ' he said			1
asked later in the interview to name his biggest failure , @entity1 cited a lack of comprehensive immigration reform , but added : ' it ’s not for a lack of trying or desire			1
' @entity1 ’s @entity62 fundraiser was attended by former @entity116 governor @entity176 and @entity177 of the @entity178 and included a performance by @entity181 lead singer @entity180			0
@entity180 broke out a @entity183 - made ukulele and joked : ' it ’s got a little birth certificate right in there , ' a reference to discredited claims that @entity1 was not born in the @entity18			1
