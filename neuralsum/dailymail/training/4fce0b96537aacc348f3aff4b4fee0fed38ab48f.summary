@entity0 said @entity1 had demonstrated he ' loves playing for @entity2 ' with his performance in the 4 - 1 victory at @entity5 in the @entity6			1
@entity1 delivered a stand - out individual display as part of what was an impressive team effort by the @entity2 in the @entity6 last 32 first leg in @entity11 , notching three of their goals to register his first @entity2 hat - trick			1
the 21 - year - old @entity17 striker , who @entity2 paid a club record £ 28 million for last summer to recruit him from @entity19 after having him on loan for the previous season , was quoted last week following a 1 - 0 loss to his former employers as saying he would like to ' eventually arrive at a top club again			1
' @entity2 forward @entity1 put in a dazzling performance against @entity5 in the @entity6 @entity2 boss @entity0 says that @entity1 's performance demonstrates his commitment to the club @entity1 was quoted saying he wanted to play for a ' top club ' again , implying @entity2 were not one but @entity0 played down that matter after the @entity5 match , saying : ' there has been a lot written about that - there was a conversation taken a little bit out of context after the @entity19 game			1
' it was clearly someone looking for a headline about if @entity43 wanted to perform in order to come back to @entity19 , and his answer probably did n't reflect what he meant			1
' it 's never an issue			0
@entity43 was delighted to commit himself to @entity2			2
' he loves playing for @entity2 , and i think he showed that today			2
' a footballer needs to be measured by the way he talks on the pitch			0
sometimes a microphone can be put in front of you and people then dissect everything you say and highlight a word or line which is not appropriate			0
' it 's not an issue			0
he 's a special footballer who we love seeing developing , and he 's just enjoying being an important player for @entity2			2
' @entity0 added of @entity1 , who now has 13 goals this season : ' he 's the complete striker , but he 's only 21 and people forget about that			1
' our desire and work we put in over the summer was to show we are the perfect place for him to develop			2
' we saw today he really makes a difference in front of goal and he 's someone who is going to have a really strong ending to the season			0
' the @entity2 paid a club - record £ 28 million transfer fee to sign @entity1 from @entity19 last summer the @entity82 has scored 13 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions for @entity2 so far this season although @entity2 , 12th in the @entity87 , have struggled for momentum domestically this season , they have flourished in what is their first continental campaign since 2009 - 10			1
that continued to be the case at the @entity94 , despite the fact they were playing on an artificial pitch - they had prepared by training on a similar surface at home - and fell behind early on to @entity102 's curler			2
the @entity2 stormed back , with two @entity1 efforts either side of a @entity106 finish , as well as some @entity108 heroics and a goal - line block from @entity110 , seeing them go in at half time 3 - 1 up			1
@entity1 subsequently completed his treble just before the hour , and @entity2 soon after had @entity112 sent off for pulling back @entity102 , who missed the resulting penalty			1
@entity0 said : ' i was extremely delighted with the reaction , because coming away from home and conceding the first goal , it becomes a big mountain to climb and a real test of character			2
' i thought it was incredible the way we took responsibility and got on the ball - some of our attacking play was electric			2
' the amount of chances we created was testament to the performance , and remember @entity5 have a fantastic home record ( five @entity6 victories out of five this season prior to the @entity2 game )			1
that makes it an even more special result			0
' it was a team performance that deserves incredible credit , also because we went down to 10 men			0
' @entity112 will learn massively from today 's moment			0
we had to dig deep and defend with 10 men but we still looked like the team with most threat			0
that says a lot about the tactical awareness the players have developed			0
' when you see us play ( in @entity149 this season ) it seems we get back to the memories of last season ( when @entity2 finished fifth in the @entity87 ) - a real enjoyment , bravery and energy in everything we do			1
' @entity2 defender @entity112 was shown a red card during his side 's 4 - 1 win over @entity5 the victory at @entity5 sees @entity0 ' men take a commanding lead into the tie 's second leg both @entity165 and @entity110 came off injured , but @entity0 dismissed the idea that had been down to the pitch			1
@entity5 boss @entity168 claimed @entity2 's second and third goals should have been disallowed for offside			1
he said : ' that was a tough night for us			0
' we had a good start , were very dynamic and scored the first goal , but then we lost control of the game			0
' we were too passive and then we had the two goals against us which were offside , which made it even harder for us			0
' we tried to come back after the break , but the fourth goal was it for us			0
it was a very unlucky evening , but we have to accept that - that 's football			0
