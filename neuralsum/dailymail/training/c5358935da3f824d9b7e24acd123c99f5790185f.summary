families have been spending more of their income on pleasure to try to escape the pressures of recession , an official report said yesterday			1
it found that we have been spending more on package holidays , televisions , hi - tech gadgets and sports tickets and less on food and soft drinks			1
the increase in the amounts devoted to leisure has come at a time when family budgets remain stressed , according to the annual @entity20 report from the @entity21			2
but , after allowing for inflation , this was over than £ 30 a week less than each household was able to spend before the recession struck , in 2006 , and below spending levels of the early 2000s			1
according to the @entity21 spending measurements , charted in an annual survey of 5,000 homes , people have been turning to entertainment to try to compensate for their stagnant incomes			2
last year an average family spent the biggest share of its income on paying for its home , and for fuel and power - £ 74.40 a week – as utility bills went up			1
the second category was transport , which took £ 70.40 out of a typical home ’s budget			0
but next came spending in the area described by the @entity21 as recreation and culture , at £ 63.90 a week , 12 per cent of the average budget			1
the category includes tv and audio - visual equipment ; computers ; books and newspapers ; sports , theatre and cinema tickets ; package holidays , and pets and garden furniture			1
report editor @entity70 said it was ‘ interesting that spending on recreation and culture has held up ’ during the recession and added that a reason could be ‘ desire for escapism ’			0
more than a third of recreational spending in a typical home went on package holidays - £ 22.40 a week – while sport , cinema and tv subscriptions took up £ 18.60 , and £ 2.20 on pet food			1
the urge to spend on items that may not be necessities was also apparent in the transport section of family spending			0
transport spending went up , the @entity21 said , partly because people were buying more new cars			1
on average families devoted £ 8.30 a week to new vehicles			1
as well as holidays , families have been splashing out on the latest new technology such as mobile phones ‘ purchasing new cars is an area where households could moderate or defer expenditure , ’ the @entity21 said , ‘ which may lead to demand building up over time			2
this is sometimes referred to as pent up demand			0
this may have fuelled the increase in sales of new cars seen in 2013 , with consumers replacing vehicles they kept hold of through the recent downturn			0
’ the survey also found that people spent almost as much on air fares - £ 5.40 a week – as on rail , tube and bus fares put together , at £ 5.50 a week			2
spending on food and non-alcoholic drink went downwards compared with rising interest in entertainment and the steep demands of energy , rent , bills and mortgages			2
the @entity21 said there were indications of a fall in spending on food , likely to be linked to families taking advantage of growing price competition between supermarkets			2
the survey showed that the average mortgage cost £ 145.40 a week , and families that rent typically paid £ 92.10 a week for their home			1
the poorest 10 per cent of homes spent just £ 189.80 on goods and services , well under a fifth of the £ 1,119.50 spending of the wealthiest tenth of households			0
the wealthiest parts of the country were the @entity152 , which over the past three years had typical household spending of £ 585.40 a week , and @entity154 , spending for each home on average £ 579.60			1
lowest spending was in the @entity157 , at £ 424.60 a week			0
in @entity159 average family spending over three years was £ 449.00 , and in @entity160 £ 438.50			0
the report noted that spending reached £ 539.80 in 2006 , ‘ and started declining , just before the economic downturn ’			0
in 2007 average household spend was £ 531.70 at 2013 prices , and reached bottom level at £ 501 in 2012			1
the decline in family spending is fresh evidence that many incomes were strained before the onset of the recession in 2008			0
last month a report from the @entity174 found that poverty among people who have jobs began to rise in 2004			0
some analysts believe pressure on wages and incomes began to rise in 2004 and 2005 when more than a million @entity183 workers began to arrive in @entity184 , many to compete for low - paid jobs .			0

families are spending more money on package holidays and gadgets
however , spending on meals out and soft drinks is being cut back
the @entity21 found weekly spending is up by £ 16.30
the average household spends in the region of £ 517.30 per week
the biggest bills include rent , mortgages , utility bills and transport
however , 12 per cent of income is dedicated to leisure *activities*
