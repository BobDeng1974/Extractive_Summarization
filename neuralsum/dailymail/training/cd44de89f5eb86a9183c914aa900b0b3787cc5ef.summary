@entity0 last night announced its long - awaited @entity2 smartwatch following months of rumour and speculation			1
during the unveiling in @entity9 , the @entity7 firm 's ceo @entity5 exclaimed that he believed the chunky watch could become a ' fashion statement ' and would revolutionise how people interact with their phones			2
yet despite the hype and bold claims the device has left many experts and consumers underwhelmed			2
reports from @entity26 claim the @entity27 will replace the chunky flat screen of the original with a curved oled display and is set to look ' totally different ' @entity31 , @entity32 at @entity33 described the voice - activated watch , pictured to scale next to a traditional watch , as gimmicky and pointless , saying : ' i have no desire to put anything on my wrist that does more than tell me the time and date ' sources also claim @entity0 has changed ' all the parts that looked dull or boring ' on the @entity2 , pictured , to make the second model more appealing @entity45 , managing director of @entity46 told @entity47 : ' the @entity2 looks the part but is a complete let down from a technical aspect			1
' the @entity52 battery will need to be charged every 24 hours , and the device is partner reliant so you ca n’t use it on any other @entity59 run @entity57 other than a @entity0			1
' he added that the ball is now in @entity63 's court next tuesday			0
@entity64 , editor of @entity65 , believes the concept of a smartwatch is a game changer but that it may not be worth snapping up a gear when it becomes available : ' you do n't need @entity0 's smartwatch , but in a year or two we 'll all have something like it			1
' it 's pretty simple to use and not as chunky as we were expecting			0
but it 's not perfect			0
' although @entity0 did n't announce a @entity65 price for the @entity2 , it did reveal it would cost $ 299 ( £ 190 ) in the @entity79 @entity80 , senior analyst at @entity81 said : ' in reality , the smart watch market represents a segment waiting for a killer - application , thereby lacking mass - market appeal			1
' while @entity0 has managed to add in some additional functionalities plus a camera compared to existing products in the market , we still do not believe that they have managed to bring out a mass market product			1
' the device is also pricey and will only further limit its adoption			2
' a survey by @entity97 carried out by @entity98 discovered that although 65 per cent of people were aware of smartwatches , less than five per cent of people asked either owned a similar device or were interested in buying one			1
@entity0 's @entity2 smartwatch is pictured next to the @entity7 ' firms latest @entity107 phablet			1
the watch will only be compatible with the phablet from launch , although software updates will expand this compatibility to other @entity0 phones - a decision that has been criticised for not being inclusive enough to attract people to buy it and the biggest turn off for those not interested in the technology was quoted as price			1
@entity120 , chief of research at @entity97 said : ' given many consumers are used to getting their smartphones ' free ' with a contract , that 's a hefty sum to pay on top			2
' @entity127 , which announced its own version of the technology called @entity130 2 earlier this year , revealed at the @entity132 conference in @entity9 that the device would go on sale at the end of the year and would cost £ 149.99 - potentially £ 50 cheaper than @entity0 's model			1
@entity45 , managing director of @entity46 ' the @entity2 ( picutred ) looks the part but is a complete let down from a technical aspect ' the @entity2 will also only work with the @entity107 phablet from launch , before software updates add the @entity142 and @entity143 in october			0
@entity45 , from @entity144 , has criticised this decision , which restricts how many people can buy and use the device			1
@entity127 's device , alternatively , will work with ' most @entity59 phones ' , which increases its appeal further , plus , anyone who pre-orders @entity127 's new @entity153 phone will get the @entity130 2 for free from network operator @entity154			2
@entity97 's research also found that 40 per cent of people who own devices already , such as the @entity158 and wearable fitness trackers , got ' bored ' of the gadgets quickly , suggesting the same fate may lie for @entity0 , and other company 's , smartwatches			1
in reference to the design , @entity31 , @entity32 at @entity33 described the technology as gimmicky and pointless , saying : ' i have no desire to put anything on my wrist that does more than tell me the time and date			2
why do i want a camera on my watch ? why do i need to access the internet from my wrist ? what could i possibly do on a smart watch that i could n't do on a smartphone ? ' he continued that smartwatches have never sold well and he does n't expect the @entity2 to do any better			0
@entity184 from the analyst firm told @entity185 : ' in @entity182 's device forecast we have an assumption built into our model that says that less than 3 percent of consumers replacing their smartphone will replace it with a smartwatch in 2017			0
' while fellow @entity182 colleague @entity193 told @entity47 : ' so far consumer demand for products like smartwatches has been limited , @entity0 and @entity27 are two strong brands and @entity0 will evolve this category , but we expect in general that the new smart watches entering the market will still likely appeal to early adopters of technology first			1
' @entity127 's @entity130 2 , pictured , was shown off at a @entity127 event ahead of @entity0 's conference at @entity132 in @entity205			1
research claims price will be the main barrier to people buying the technology , which may explain why @entity154 is offering customers who pre-order the @entity153 directly the device - worth £ 149.99 - for free @entity127 's @entity130 2 , pictured , will be available in the @entity65 from the end of september @entity120 from @entity97 continued : ' manufacturers have to urgently address how to expand their appeal beyond the usual ' geek niche ' [ of male technology fans ] to ensure they do n't end up just being a flash in the pan			1
' this theory was bolstered by the fact social media analysts , we are @entity224 found that during the @entity0 event , 81 per cent of comments were from males , while 19 per cent were from females			1
@entity229 , editor at @entity230 told @entity47 : ' the @entity2 is a marvel of engineering but is confused about what it wants to be			0
' it packs too much power to only be a companion device to your phone , but lacks the connectivity to make it a useful standalone device			0
' other experts also highlighted the potential security risks of the device			0
@entity241 , vice president of product management at @entity243 said : ' although @entity0 ’s new smartwatch is new in terms of wearable technology , it is in essence another example of a connected device and therefore will be subject to similar hacks and attacks we ’ve seen recently on mobile devices , tablets , automobiles and appliances			1
' a recent survey by security firm @entity259 of 5,000 consumers found that 69 per cent felt wearable technology will become more intrusive as it develops and were concerned about privacy			2
yet it 's not all doom and gloom , @entity266 , from cloud storage experts @entity268 said that with smartwatches like the @entity2 , the ' opportunities are endless ' and claims it wo n't just appeal to technology fans , but ' could benefit continuous health monitoring , or enable our ageing population to be cared for remotely at home rather than in a care home			0
' and people who have actually handled the device are more positive			2
@entity280 from @entity281 told @entity282 said the device ' was absolutely impressive ' adding : ' i was n't expecting to see such a beautiful screen			0
it 's very elegantly designed , a very nice finish but what 's really impressive is the @entity290 screen			0
' it definitely has a wow factor and it has a nice capacitive touchscreen and very smooth applications			0
' figures from social media analysts we are @entity224 found that on launch day , the @entity2 received 58,000 mentions on @entity299 , blogs and forums			2
the @entity107 received 29,900 and references to unpacked - the name of the @entity0 event - totalled 5,400			1
the # galaxygear hashtag got 5,090 mentions			0
before the event there were 140,000 mentions for the @entity143			0
during the unpacked event , we are @entity224 has created a gender breakdown of those who mentioned the conference			0
based on a sample of 11,931 @entity299 handles , 81 per cent were male while 19 per cent were female			0
the overall reaction on social media to the device was : unimpressed : 41 per cent innovative : 49 per cent general @entity319 : 10 per cent continuing on the subject of apps , @entity323 from venture capital firm @entity324 : ' there is no doubt that @entity0 ’s @entity2 is going to cause a shift in the wearable tech industry			1
' analysts have estimated that the industry is already worth $ 3 - 5 billion today and in the next three years could be worth up to $ 50 billion			1
that is an incredible wave to ride if you are @entity0			2
' ' but what is more interesting is the impact this will have on the apps that we use			0
' @entity339 has completely changed social – the social web was about context and social mobile is about interaction ie games , events and real time , albeit ephemeral , communication			0
' ' just one small example , but i ’m excited to see that they have launched with @entity350			0
' this will radically change how i keep notes on everything from new startups that i meet , a bottle of wine that i tried at dinner that i want to remember and reading a new recipe on my wrist as i cook for my wife			0
' following the launch , @entity361 saw 11 per cent of the entire searches on its website for @entity0 's smartwatch .			2

@entity0 announced details of it @entity22 on *wednesday*
initial reactions have branded the device a ' let down ' and ' a gimmick '
research also found only 5 **%** of people are interested in the technology
and 40 **%** of people who already own similar gadgets got ' bored ' easily
analysts are predicting poor sales and slow take - up for the device
