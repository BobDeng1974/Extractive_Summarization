when it comes to boxing stereotypes , @entity0 has shattered more than his fair share			1
born in the middle class town of @entity5 on the north shore of @entity7 , the 30 - year - old still lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974			1
his bookshelf is lined with tomes from @entity15 's @entity14 to @entity17 's autobiography to books on diet and nutrition			1
@entity0 has no amateur career having made the transition from kickboxing six years ago and was virtually an unknown until he became a world champion in june			1
but on saturday he will earn around $ 1.5million when he takes on @entity24 in the gambling mecca of @entity26			1
indeed , this will be the first fight that @entity0 has n't been working while training			1
on the tuesday before his shock victory over @entity44 last summer , he was putting a personal training client through his paces			0
' i worked with a lot of athletes helping them , especially combat athletes			0
then also mums , middle aged mothers that want to get back in shape after pregnancy or just being home and not training			0
i had a very varied client list			0
' it was @entity0 's grandfather who first piqued @entity0 's interest in boxing with tales of @entity62 legend @entity61			1
but despite being enthralled by the likes of @entity65 , it was to martial arts and eventually kickboxing that a teenage @entity0 turned			1
a professional by 19 , he won two world titles but after suffering a broken elbow and a badly - injured knee , decided the risk / reward ratio was skewed against him			2
six months later , he had switched to boxing			0
@entity24 poses for the cameras during a workout session in @entity26 , showing off his trim physique the @entity24 ( right ) works with trainer @entity27 ahead of his fight with @entity0 in the gambling mecca of @entity26 ' a lot of the [ kickboxing ] techniques are very similar to punch techniques , ' says @entity0			1
' the fact that i 've been fighting without a headgear for such a long time i think has really helped with my defence in my pro boxing career			0
' but , in terms of how this sport is fought ; it 's a totally different pace			2
boxing is a lot faster , conditioning is a lot more intensive and fights are longer			0
' after 20 fights , all in @entity98 , over a six - year period , he was pitted against light - welterweight champion @entity44 , a hard - hitting @entity100 nicknamed the @entity101			1
@entity0 was knocked down twice in the first round but , despite his right eye closing during the fight , recovered to win a split - decision victory			1
' it 's zero to one hundred and that is just the nature of the game , ' he says			2
' it 's nothing then boom ! it 's the nature of the business and i 'm not surprised by it			2
' i 've been watching this sports for years and i have seen it with other fighters			0
i knew my time would come i just had to stay focused and disciplined and if you work hard good things happen			0
i am right where i am supposed to be			0
' on saturday , that will be sharing a ring with @entity24 , the eight - division world champion who still craves a shot at @entity126			1
but @entity0 is confident he can punch a considerable dent in those ambitions			1
' i 've got length , i 've got reach , i 've got speed ; i 've got footwork and defence , but that 's not what 's going to be the difference in this fight , ' he adds			2
' it 's not a tall guy versus a short guy - it 's @entity0 versus @entity24			1
it 's what i bring to the table versus what he brings to the table			0
i think a lot of it has to do with my mental preparation and mind going into this fight as well as what we know from @entity24			2
' we know @entity24 is a living legend			2
he 's one of the greatest fighters that has ever lived			0
for me , i have to go out there and be myself			0
i have the talent and the tools to win this fight - i just have to go out there and perform			0

@entity0 goes toe - to - toe with @entity24 on saturday in @entity26
the @entity167 lives in the basement of the house his parents built in 1974
he has a degree in health care sciences and a master 's in clinical nutrition
the 30 - year - old will earn $ 1.5million when he *squares* up to @entity24
