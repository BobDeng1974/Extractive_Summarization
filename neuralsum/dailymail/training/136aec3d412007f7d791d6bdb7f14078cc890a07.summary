by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:15 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 05:35 est , 14 december 2012 a new phase of drilling for shale gas , which the government hopes will revolutionise @entity7 ’s energy supply , was given the go - ahead yesterday			1
the controversial technique of extracting the gas from subterranean rock – known as fracking – was suspended last year after it was believed to have caused two small earthquakes in @entity13			2
energy secretary @entity14 said new conditions had now been imposed to minimise the risk of seismic activity			1
fears have been expressed over possible water pollution and nuisance from lorries transporting equipment , but mr @entity14 pledged to address them			0
‘ it is essential that shale gas development should not come at the expense of local communities , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity35 must be safe and the public must be confident that it is safe			0
‘ we are strengthening the stringent regime already in place with new controls around seismic risks			0
and as the industry develops we will remain vigilant to all emerging evidence to ensure the local environment is protected			0
’ advocates of fracking – the process by which water and chemicals are pumped into shale deposits at high pressure to release trapped pockets of gas – say it will end our dependence on expensive imports and protect consumers from rising prices , as @entity60 gas reserves dwindle			2
@entity61 this week backed the technology and said @entity7 should be at the heart of the shale ‘ gas revolution ’ , claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills			1
@entity67 mr @entity14 was more cautious yesterday , saying only that shale gas would hold down future gas price rises rather than slash them , as has happened in the @entity71			1
nearly two - thirds of the country could be sitting on estimated gas reserves of up to 300trillion cubic feet , according to industry experts – enough to supply @entity7 for 120 years			2
but it is not yet clear how much of the trapped gas is recoverable , with drilling so far restricted to @entity13 , where energy firm @entity79 has dug four exploratory wells			2
when it announced its finds last year , @entity79 said it would drill up to 800 wells over 16 years and , if production was successful , it could create thousands of jobs and generate £ 5billion - £ 6billion in tax revenues			0
the @entity86 has granted 176 exploration licences across @entity7 , although holders still require further consent before fracking can commence			2
it is thought fracking will not begin again until late march at the earliest because @entity79 will need to secure fresh planning permission for its wells			0
there is growing local concern about fracking in @entity13 , as well as other areas thought to be rich in shale gas such as @entity99 and @entity100			1
the campaign to @entity102 yesterday warned of a greater backlash if large areas of countryside were ‘ transformed into industrial sites ’ with a steady stream of lorries transporting gas and polluted water away from drilling sites			1
controversial : drilling in the @entity114 area last year caused a small earthquake but the government wants to expand the use of fracking in @entity7 @entity119 , the @entity120 ’s senior planning officer , said : ‘ the government does n’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage , or the need to properly consider this at the local level			1
’ the rural splendour of @entity129 ’s constituency in @entity130 could be blighted by his enthusiasm for shale gas exploration			1
@entity133 includes unspoilt countryside , the historic towns of @entity136 and @entity137 , and villages such as @entity139 – said to have more millionaires per square mile than anywhere else in the country			0
professor @entity144 of @entity145 said the rocks in @entity133 are of interest to energy firms as they are from the same period as those in @entity13 , where exploratory drilling suggests there could be enough shale gas to power @entity7 for decades			1
he added shale gas exploration requires ‘ around a football pitch worth of land ’ per site			1
a report from the @entity157 also lists @entity130 as an area of interest for ‘ fracking ’ – the technique used to extract the gas			2
but exploration in the area could be opposed by residents , who have been swift to protest against threats to the countryside in the past concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to @entity172 ’s world - famous hot springs if a test - drill for gas was allowed in the area by the local authority			2
in the @entity71 , households near to wells have complained of increased traffic and polluted water supplies			0
but the @entity181 stressed that if the environmental fears could be allayed , shale gas offered great potential for the future			1
its senior economic adviser @entity186 said the @entity7 ’s energy mix must include more gas , along with green energy and nuclear power , to meet carbon targets			1
and energy minister @entity192 added that the @entity121 had taken ‘ the very best ’ scientific advice on fracking and said : ‘ we have out every safeguard in place ; this is the most rigorous regime in the world , i think			0
’ however , some in mr @entity14 ’s party remain unconvinced that shale gas will provide the predicted energy revolution			1
a senior @entity67 source told the @entity204 : ‘ there is no principled objection to shale gas			1
but all these @entity208 calling for it could be in for a rude awakening			0
' shale gas wells will generate a lot of traffic and disruption			1
it could make objections to onshore wind look like a picnic			0
’ environmentalists fear a ‘ dash for gas ’ could also prevent @entity7 meeting its climate change targets			1
but mr @entity14 said these would be met , despite resumption of fracking			0
he said : ‘ shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the @entity7			1
it could contribute significantly to our energy security , reducing our reliance on imported gas			1
’ the new controls will include a ‘ traffic light system ’ , requiring operators to stop if seismic activity reaches 0.5 on the @entity235			0
an industry source said : ‘ the new threshold is very conservative – it ’s the equivalent of a large vehicle driving past on the road			0
’ last year protestors attached themselves to the @entity79 shale gas exploration site near @entity242 in @entity13 so how serious are the environmental concerns ? by @entity244 shale gas could become the greatest contribution to @entity7 ’s energy supplies since the @entity60 boom of the 1970s			1
but those against fracking say the environmental consequences outweigh the benefits			0
so what are those concerns and how serious are they ? earthquakes much has been made of the suspension of exploratory fracking at @entity114 last year after two small quakes of @entity235 magnitude 1.5 and 2.2 were recorded			0
the @entity79 drilling company said that its operations were probably responsible			0
but they were too minor to do any damage – and according to the @entity265 there were nine tremors in the @entity7 of the same magnitude in the past two months alone			2
a follow - up study by the @entity86 concluded that the risk of earthquakes caused by fracking was low , and structural damage to buildings , bridges and roads was extremely unlikely			0
pollution millions of gallons of water and chemicals are forced into the ground during fracking operations , and there are concerns that some of the residue could leak into the water table			0
however , @entity288 ’s @entity287 says there is little risk to water supplies in the @entity7 , as long as the drilling is done correctly			2
anger : demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the @entity299 leaks in @entity71 have been caused by badly maintained wells which have n’t been lined properly			0
@entity7 supporters of shale gas development say rules are tougher here			1
@entity71 companies are also allowed to store dirty water from fracking wells in open tanks , whereas in @entity7 fracking companies will have to store the water in sealed containers on site			1
concerns have also been expressed about chemicals leaking from gas wells into underground water aquifers and reaching the domestic supply			0
however , most fracking is done thousands of feet deep – far below the water table			0
energy secretary @entity14 made a statement to @entity288 on the government 's new policy on shale gas @entity71 protesters have complained about methane getting into their drinking water			1
again , the industry says this was caused by bad fracking			0
if wells are lined , there is no reason why methane should escape			0
threat to the landscape the @entity86 says nearly two thirds of @entity7 lies over shale gas reserves			1
if the predicted boom materialises , gas wells could spring up across the countryside			0
while they are not as imposing as wind farms , pylons or power stations , this would represent some industrialisation of rural @entity7			2
@entity79 concedes that drilling and fracking rigs would be visible from a distance , but would be on site for only a few months			2
after that , they say wells could be screened from view			0
@entity353 fleets of lorries will be needed to bring in excavation , drilling and storage equipment to create the well , and to bring the sand and chemicals for the fracking process			0
in the short term , shale gas would also be taken away by lorries , though it is cheaper to pipe it out			2
over time , however , gas companies will almost certainly create a network of new gas pipes			0
the benefits in @entity71 , fracking has slashed domestic gas prices and there could be similar major effects on household energy bills in the @entity7			1
@entity61 believes shale gas will eventually bring down prices here			1
energy secretary @entity14 is a little more cautious , however , saying only that it will hold price increases down – but even that would be a relief to the long - suffering consumer			2
what is beyond doubt is that shale gas would reduce our reliance on imports , particularly those from @entity390 @entity7 could also reduce reliance on piped gas from overseas by investing in desperately needed storage			1
in environmental terms , shale gas is deemed to be cleaner than coal and oil , though slightly less clean than @entity60 gas			2
