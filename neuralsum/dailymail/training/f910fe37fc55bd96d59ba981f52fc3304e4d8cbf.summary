by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:55 am on 18th november 2011 when @entity3 returns home after a hard day ’s work , he opens his front door and steps back more than 70 years			1
for the 45 - year - old bus driver is a one - man time - warp from the 1930s			1
his clothes and semi-detached home are all in keeping with his obsession with @entity15 on the eve of @entity17 a vintage telephone stands on the hall table beside an exquisite art deco lamp , just a foretaste to the living room that ’s packed with mirrors , clocks , ornaments and picture frames from the era			1
@entity28 : @entity3 relaxes by the wireless in his front room as neighbour @entity31 tries out the 1938 @entity32 all mod cons : left ; a dial telephone would have been the latest thing and the lamp the height of fashion and there ’s a copy of his favourite paper on the chair and right ; a jumble of 1930s wooden - shafted golf clubs , straw boaters , a metal @entity49 case , leather suitcases			1
and even a banjo mr @entity3 is never seen wearing anything out of keeping with his favourite era — except in the cab of his bus			1
he does n’t own a washing machine and instead laborious scrubs his clothes outside in a dolly tub then squeezes them through a mangle			1
his @entity32 dates from 1938			1
‘ i ’m really a time traveller who lost his way , ’ he says			0
‘ but i ’m 45 , so it ’s too late to change now ! i just love the era , it was a much simpler time			2
’ mr @entity3 ’s home , in @entity68 , @entity69 , was unmodernised when he bought it seven years ago — the couple who had owned it since it was built in 1936 had lived there for more than 50 years			2
since then he has set about collecting suitable antiques , old newspapers and knick - knacks from car - boot sales			2
he says : ‘ my clothes are from the era , too			2
but as i ’m 6ft 4in i ’ve had to get most of them tailor - made using authentic materials , as there were n’t many people my height in the 1930s , ’ he explains			0
squeezy does it : hand - scrubbed clothes are wrung through the mangle before being hung out to dry mr @entity3 ’s favourite period is 1939 and the early months of the war			1
he and a group of fellow enthusiasts , including neighbour @entity94 , gather for soirees and even stage re-enactments of @entity98 exercises			0
antique wirelesses and gramophones are dotted about the house , playing 78s by @entity104 bandleaders such as @entity105 and @entity106			0
mr @entity3 does , however , have a refrigerator and a television — albeit a black - and - white model made in 1947			0
‘ people think i ’m a lunatic , but it ’s just my passion , ’ he adds			0
full rations : the store cupboard , left , is packed with vintage bottles , tins and even dried peas			0
names include @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and mansion polish			0
and right , an air raid warden 's outfit hangs on the landing near a @entity128 radio ideal for tuning into @entity130 's speeches and so to bed : a candlewick bedspread ( no duvet ) on the heavy carved dark wooden bedstead home sweet home : one of the few 1930s semis to have escaped a makeover			0
