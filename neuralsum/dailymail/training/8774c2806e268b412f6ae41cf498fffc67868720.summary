the @entity0 is often described as the most exciting division in world football , and it certainly matches @entity4 ’s @entity3 for goal action			2
but as @entity8 's wide - ranging study of the world ’s football leagues reveals , both are outstripped by @entity12 ’s @entity11 among their ' @entity14 ’ rivals , and fans of nine other major divisions around the world see more goals per game			2
using numbers for the most recently complete seasons in 34 leagues around the world , the @entity21 league has more goals per game than anywhere ( 3.31 per game ) followed by the @entity29 top division ( 3.20 ) and then @entity11 ( 3.16 )			2
those are the only three averaging more than three goals a game			0
the @entity0 saw 1,052 goals scored last season , including this by @entity36 against @entity37 @entity38 has already scored 12 goals for @entity40 since his summer move from @entity42 @entity43 was the @entity0 's top scorer last season , his 31 included this beauty against @entity45 the @entity0 is 10th on the list of 34 leagues around the world , with 2.77 goals per game to @entity3 's 2.75 per game in 11th place			1
@entity53 ’s @entity52 is 15th ( 2.72 goals a game ) and @entity57 's @entity56 down in 28th , with 2.45 goals per game			0
one quirky feature of the goal - scoring findings - for the seasons considered at least - is that the more northerly the league , the likelier a high - scoring tally of goals per game			0
the six top divisions in goals per game were all in the northern-most group of countries in the study ( @entity21 , @entity70 , @entity12 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ) while the six lowest - scoring leagues were all in the southern-most group of nations ( @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 )			0
there were an average of 2.75 goals per game in @entity3 last season , @entity83 scored quite a few of them @entity52 had the second lowest goal - to - game ratio of @entity93 's top five leagues , despite @entity95 's efforts whether this is because climatic differences tend to mean northern football is faster and more error - prone in cold places but slower and lower - scoring when it ’s hot is far from clear			1
but @entity57 was the only ' northerly ' country among the dozen lowest - scoring leagues , with 2.45 goals per game last season			0
@entity103 ’s @entity0 is a middle - ranking league in goals terms , with 2.75 scored per game last season putting it in 13th place , fractionally behind @entity3 and @entity107 ’s @entity106			1
the @entity11 has more goals per game ( 3.31 ) than any other top league in the world the @entity12 @entity11 is third overall in the list thanks to goals from the likes of @entity115 ( centre )			1

@entity0 *ahead* of @entity3 in terms of goals per game last season
most goals per game are scored in @entity11
trend *suggests* more goals in northern leagues than southern leagues
@entity12 @entity11 most goals per game from top five @entity132 leagues
