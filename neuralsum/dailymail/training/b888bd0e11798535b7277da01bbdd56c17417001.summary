the space team are using the medieval technology to ensure pictures beamed back from @entity7 accurately show the colours found on the @entity7			0
scientists have been struggling to see what the surface of @entity7 looks like because the high ultra violet radiation in the atmosphere causes colours to fade			0
@entity3 space scientists are using medieval stained - glass to build a ' @entity6 ' camera bound for @entity7 but researchers have now taken divine inspiration from medieval stained - glass - because their colours have n't faded after hundreds of years being bombarded by uv radiation			1
although medieval glass artisans did n't know they were using it , nanotechnology played a key part in creating stained - glass windows			1
medieval stained - glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the ' glass matrix ' to create a red colour			1
silver nanoparticles , meanwhile , gave it a deep yellow colour			0
professor @entity35 , based at @entity36 , said : ' @entity7 has little to no ozone in the atmosphere and this means that the high ultra violet radiation can cause colours to fade when exposed to sunlight			0

medieval stained - glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the ' glass matrix ' to create a red colour			1
silver nanoparticles , meanwhile , gave it a deep yellow colour			0
this meant that it would never fade , despite sitting in sunlit windows for hundreds of years			0
similar stained - glass will be used in a robotic camera during the @entity68 's @entity67 mission to the @entity7 in 2019			1
the colour centres in the @entity67 's camera are formed as a nano - particle suspension within the glass and this acts as an efficient @entity75 blocker			2
' the stained - glass idea comes from observing the many stained - glass windows in churches - many of which date back to medieval times			1
' these have been exposed to sunlight for centuries and show little to no colour degradation			0
' the stained - glass will be used in a robotic camera during the @entity68 's @entity67 mission to the @entity7 in 2019			1
the 350kg rover 's mission will be to scour the surface of @entity7 for signs of past or present life			2
it will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down , and scientific instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present			0
a team of scientists from @entity36 in @entity99 have created the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) and the medieval stained - glass it will use			1
professor @entity35 said : ' scientists want the images from @entity7 to be colour corrected - as if they were being viewed by a human - to help identify scientific targets			0
the small stained - glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm @entity109 mm , are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams			2
space scientists are using medieval stained - glass inside a camera being sent on a mission to @entity7			1
pictured here is the glass which is to be used in the camera a team of scientists from @entity36 in @entity99 have created the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) and the medieval stained - glass it will use ' i have colleagues at @entity121 who specialise in glass research and when they heard we needed stable coloured targets for the calibration target they said use stained - glass			1
' the colour centres are formed as a nano - particle suspension within the glass and this acts as an efficient @entity75 blocker			2
' this prevents chemical reactions from occurring that will change the colours			0
' the small stained - glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm @entity109 mm , are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams			2
they were made using traditional medieval processes developed hundreds of years ago			0
professor @entity35 said : ' we had to go back to some old chemistry " recipe " books to find out these traditional methods			0
the @entity145 will be the science ' eyes ' for @entity68 's @entity7 rover mission in 2019 and will feature a novel colour correction system to ensure that images sent back to earth truly represent the colours on @entity7 ' a lot of trial and error has gone into perfecting the process and i 'm pretty sure stained - glass has never been used on any @entity7 mission before			1

the camera and stained - glass chips are currently being tested in @entity169 's @entity168 desert where @entity170 filmed the climax to his second outing as @entity173			2
the field trials are being held around the the @entity176 ( @entity176 ) hotel at @entity177 - used as the @entity173 villain 's lair in @entity180 - because the barren desert replicates the rocky red surface of @entity7			0
the @entity121 team will be responsible for processing the images taken by @entity101 during mission using a variety of computer vision techniques and algorithms they have developed			0

the @entity100 will be used in @entity68 's 2019 @entity7 rover mission
nanoparticles will act as @entity75 blockers to capture true colours on the planet
this was inspired by the use of nanoparticles in medieval stained - glass windows , which never fade in colour
