by @entity0 a dilapidated school where pupils were forced to have lessons in the corridor because of the decaying classrooms is still in a state of disrepair one year on			1
teachers at @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , have told how nothing has changed			1
one one occasion in the last twelve months , a corridor was turned into a river after blocked and cracked storm drains overflowed			1
bleak outlook : pupils @entity18 and @entity19 have to resort to holding an umbrella at @entity9 in @entity11 because there are so many leaks in their dilapidated classroom disrepair : after class , the two youngsters have to then walk along crumbling corridors , one of which became a river when a cracked storm drain overflowed and in the last two weeks , six leaks have sprung up in classroom roofs , forcing the children to hold umbrellas during lessons			1
it all adds to a tale of woe at the 509 - pupil school - soon to increase to 700 students in september - that includes crumbling walls , moldy carpets , drafty doors , cracked windows , collapsing roofs and freezing classrooms			1
when @entity49 , minister of state for schools , visited he dubbed the conditions the worst he has ever seen			2
mr @entity49 added : ' i would be very cross about the standard of the building if i was a parent with children at the school			1
this is clearly a very poor building that was built in the 1950s and needs work			0
patch job : headteacher @entity60 in one of the out - of - bounds classrooms , which have sprung six leaks in the last two weeks expensive : mrs @entity60 looks up at one of the large leaks in the corridor			0
she believes it will revealed that it would cost upwards of £ 1million to bring the school up to standard ' @entity72 failed ' : schools minister @entity49 ( pictured ) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week the run - down primary school hit the headlines last year when four and five - year - olds were forced to have lessons in a corridor after their classroom was flooded by a faulty boiler			1
and just five months later part of a roof collapsed - again forcing kids out of their classroom			0
pupils , teachers and parents have since campaigned for a rebuild - even taking their fight to @entity89 and the @entity90 in july			0
their protests prompted a visit from mr @entity49 yesterday , where the minister praised staff in keeping teaching standards at the school high , even when the facilities were not			1
he said : ' this is a school focused on making sure that children improve their reading and arithmetic , despite the problems that they labour under			2
' the school is now part of seven in @entity11 bidding for funding as part of the @entity108			1
but headteacher @entity60 said : ' we will have to wait and see if funding materialises			0
hopefully our school will be at the top of the list to receive money or a rebuild			2
frustrated : mrs @entity60 , pointing out a crack in the food store cupboard , is desperately hoping for funding to materialise before conditions get any worse ' @entity72 failed ' : schools minister @entity49 ( pictured ) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week ' for now we will have to keep patching up the school and continue to make sure @entity122 is fit for purpose			2
' @entity60 revealed that it would cost upwards of £ 1million to bring the school up to standard - including a £ 40,000 boiler system and £ 25,000 to install new doors and windows throughout			1
the headteacher added : ' since last year when we moved classes into a corridor , that has been flooded by broken storm drains overflowing			2
' it was like a river running down the corridor			0
we are running out of rooms which do n’t have anything wrong with them to be honest			0
' it meant we had to take classes into the main hall , which is not ideal			0
' i think there are issues over funding for schools			0
they need to do surveys to make sure schools do n’t get to the stage we are at again			0
' the most frustrating thing is that the decision on who will receive money keeps on being put back			0
' it could be another year before we see any change but i am very optimistic and the minister had nothing but good things to say about the level of teaching			2
@entity11 mp @entity166 , who has raised the school 's plight in parliament , said : ' we made sure the schools minister was aware of the really shocking state of the building and he said it was the worst he had seen			1
' i knew that if he came he would be shocked and all we can hope for is that it puts @entity122 at the centre of minds when it comes to deciding funding allocations for the @entity108			0

crumbling walls , moldy carpets , cracked windows and collapsing roofs **...**
