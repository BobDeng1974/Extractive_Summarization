@entity1 mum @entity0 caused quite a stir by announcing the reason her husband still fancied her is because he did n't attend the birth of their child			1
as someone who specialises in advising people on sex and relationships , i am obviously going to champion the benefits of sex			1
but i 'm also fully aware there are times when sex - very necessarily - gets put on the backburner and takes not just second , but last place on the priority list			1
most women are terrified giving birth			2
not just a little bit nervous but paralysed with fear			0
is n't this the one time when it really should be all about you ? @entity22 says that men are n't the only ones who have to move past the gory aftermath of childbirth imagine this scenario : you 're being wheeled into the labour ward , petrified , and your partner - the person who is supposed to love and support you though sickness and health and surely through giving bloody birth - hangs back and says , ' um , honey			1
actually , do you mind if i sit this one out ? i know you 're about to experience the worst pain imaginable but it might put me off having sex the next time we have it '			2
would you look him in the eyes , take his hand and say , ' of course i understand			0
come back when the baby 's been washed and powdered and i 've got my make - up on and in a sexy nightie			0
' or would you use your last minute of cohesive thought to call a divorce lawyer and invite them into the delivery room so you can sign the papers in between pushing out the baby ? call me callous but think i 'd be going for option two			0
@entity22 says that when it comes to the birth of your child , sex should be the last thing on your mind of course it 's going to be traumatic for men when her ladybits - usually a source of pleasure - suddenly transform into something that causes pain and are , indisputably , not at their most attractive			1
men are n't the only ones who have to move past the gory mess that is childbirth and go back to thinking of the vagina as somewhere that nice things happen			2
women have to deal with it , too			0
women also have to deal with rather a lot of other things to do with pregnancy and birth in order to feel like sex again			1
shifting the baby weight and trying to feel sexy three sizes larger than they were , coming to grips with stretch marks and a body that 's shifted and changed after lugging around a baby for months are n't exactly easy to move past			2
neither is trying to find the motivation to have sex after having had one hour 's sleep a week for the last four months			1
i get the argument for men not watching the birth			2
i 've read the letters i get from men saying there are ramifications and it does take a while for those images to disappear and for him to reconcile what 's happened before enjoying sex again			0
but , seriously , surely it 's not too much to ask that men are grown up enough to be able to rationalise that the vagina has two functions : one for pleasure and one to deliver babies ? after all , you pee out of your penis and also have sex with that			0
there appears to be no problem with mentally compartmentalising there			0
why ca n't you do the same with her vagina ? i 'm not unsympathetic to men in relation to their experience of pregnancy , birth and parenting			1
i know lots of men feel sidelined by it all and like someone stole their wife after the baby is born			0
men have told me it feels like they 're replaced and that they suddenly lost their best friend , partner and sex partner and in her place was a woman who seems there purely to service the child			1
but she 's been the one to have to put up with periods , pregnancy and birth and will shoulder the lion 's share of the parenting			1
surely it 's not too much to ask for you to be able to cope with a little blood and messiness , to be by her side when she most needs you ? check out @entity22 's books and product ranges at @entity193			0

earlier this week @entity195 writer @entity0 said the reason her sex life was still in tact was because her partner had n't seen her give birth
@entity202 is not impressed and says sex is not *important* at this point
*alongside* grief and poor health , post pregnancy should be a no sex zone
