‘ you will find that when it comes to daughters most women are for it , and most men are against it			1
’ the 69 - year - old also revealed that the transformation of his daughters from sweet girls doting on their father to angry teenagers came as a shock to him			1
he told of being ‘ bitterly wounded ’ after one of his daughters , at the age of 14 , screamed at him to ‘ get out of my room ! ’			1
he explained : ‘ i never thought she would speak to me like that			2
i was delusional , living in fairyland , which i ’ve done most of my life			2
’ the debate about whether to let teenage children stay with their boyfriends has raged in recent months			1
some parents believe it is better to know where their offspring are rather than forbid behaviour that is likely to happen anyway			2
others take a more conservative view			2
in a @entity73 interview , academic @entity71 said the reason the @entity75 and the @entity77 rates of teen pregnancy are eight and seven times higher than the @entity79 is that @entity79 parents adopt a far more liberal approach			2

i can understand parents wanting to know where their teenagers are , but i do n’t think it ’s a convincing argument for allowing partners to sleep over			0
‘ it ’s not right to assume that teenagers will have sex whether you allow it under your roof or not			0
not all teenagers want to have sex early , so there might be a danger in making it too easy – it could encourage sex to happen sooner than it otherwise would			0
