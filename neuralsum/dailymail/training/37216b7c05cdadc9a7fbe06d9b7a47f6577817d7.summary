by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 09:18 est , 14 october 2013 social networks are rife with people taking selfies , but there 's a knack to getting the photo right so it does n't feature your forearm , or is n't taken in a toilet mirror			0
to solve this first world problem , a company has created the @entity12 that syncs with an app and lets people take photos of themselves from 10 feet away			1
a stand even positions the phone at the correct angle , in both portrait and landscape modes , spelling the end of shaky photos and trying to balance the phone and press the shutter at the same time			1
the @entity25 , pictured , costs £ 14.99 and includes a stand that rests the handset at the perfect angle in both portrait and landscape			1
the wireless range is quoted as 10 feet , although tests have shown it can work at more than three times this distance wireless range : 10 feet - although tests have shown it can work up to 32 feet controls : top button takes the photo , bottom button switches between front - and rear - facing cameras battery : x @entity45 battery ( included ) extras : stand supports the phone and can be used in portrait and landscape orientation dimensions : 2.7in x 1.1in x 0.7in the handheld control costs £ 14.99 and syncs with a free @entity56 smartphone app. users position their phone , using the stand , on a flat surface			1
to take a photo , users click the top button on the remote			2
the bottom button lets a user switch between front - and back - facing cameras			0
the remote control connects with the app wirelessly over @entity70 , so does n't need to be pointed directly at the device			1
this also means photos can be taken inconspicuously			2
its maker claims it has a range of 10 feet , although tests by retailer @entity78 managed to take selfies from 32 feet away			2
@entity80 , from @entity81 , said : ' the recent rise in popularity of the ' selfie ' makes it quick and easy to capture that self - absorbed snapshot			0
to take a photo , users simply click the top button on the remote , pictured left			2
the bottom button lets a user switch between front - and back - facing cameras			0
the stand , pictured right , supports the phone meaning it can be used in portrait and landscape mode on a flat surface ' unfortunately , selfies are notoriously difficult to achieve that high - quality shot you originally hoped for			1
' not to mention how ridiculous you look to passers - by when holding your smartphone less than 12 inches away from your face as you pout awkwardly			0
' the @entity25 not only makes your selfie look more professional , it allows you to be more discreet whilst you 're taking that incredibly vain picture of you and your surroundings			0
' the control is 2.7in x 1.1in x 0.7in and takes a @entity45 battery .			0

@entity12 costs £ 14.99 and comes with a phone stand
