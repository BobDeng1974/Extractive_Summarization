powerful bursts of radiation may have wiped out life on the majority of other planets and even caused a major extinction on @entity6 , according to research			1
physicists have calculated that gamma - ray bursts - caused by some of the largest explosions in the universe - may have prevented the development of complex life in 90 per cent of galaxies			1
the intense high energy radiation given off by these explosions is known to be lethal to even the most hardy of organisms and can strip away important gases in the atmosphere			2
gamma - ray bursts , shown in the map above of the sky from @entity6 , could have left many galaxies sterile the research may help to explain why we have yet to detect any signs of complex life elsewhere in our galaxy and could mean finding any forms of life will be far harder than some believe			1
the scientists behind the study also found that @entity6 may well have been hit by a gamma - ray burst powerful enough to cause a major extinction of life in the past			1
a gamma - ray burst happens when a massive star dies , collapses into a brand - new black hole , explodes in what 's called a supernova and ejects energetic radiation			1
the radiation is as bright as can be as it travels across the universe at the speed of light			0
a planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder , astronomers say			0
scientists might be able to detect warning signs of an impending gamma ray burst , but if a burst were headed for @entity6 there would n't be anything anybody could do about it			2
however , astronomers put the chances of that happening at around 1 in 10 million			0
they calculated that there was a 50 per cent chance that such a burst took place nearby within the past 500 million years			1
they said that based on the latest measurements of gamma - ray bursts , much of the @entity68 - our own galaxy - would be inhospitable to life			1
professor @entity73 , a physicist at the @entity74 who led the work with colleagues from the @entity77 in @entity78 , said : ' we find that the probability of a lethal gamma - ray burst is much larger in the inner @entity68 , making it inhospitable to life			1
' only at the outskirts of the @entity68 , at more than 10 kiloparsecs ( 32,616 light years ) from the galactic center , does this probability drop below 50 per cent			0
' when considering the universe as a whole , the safest environments for life - similar to the one on @entity6 - are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies , and life can exist in only around 10 per cent of galaxies			2
' gamma - ray bursts occur around once a day from random directions and can be detected using telescopes tuned to detect these intense , bright flashes of energy			1
trilobites like the one in the fossil pictured above were among the 80 per cent of species that were wiped out at the end of the @entity102 period in an extinction that is thought to have been caused by a gamma - ray burst they can last for just a couple of seconds to several minutes			1
their origin remained a mystery until about a decade ago , when it became clear that they are associated with supernova explosions - caused by a rapidly collapsing star as it forms a rapidly spinning black hole			2
the most powerful gamma - ray bursts can be seen throughout the universe as the radiation is flung out from the explosion			1
gamma rays are thrown across the universe by supernova explosions , like this one in the @entity121 if one lasting just a few tens of seconds were to happen close to the @entity6 , the power of the radiation would damage the thin layer of ozone that protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation from the sun. it would also trigger a chain of chemical reactions that could cause oxygen and nitrogen to bind together , creating poisonous nitrous oxide			1
scientists believe that a burst with a brightness of around 100 kilojoules per square metre would deplete 91 per cent of the ozone within a month			0
this , they say would be enough to cause a massive life - extinction event			0
some scientists have proposed that such an event could have been the cause of the @entity102 extinction around 450 million years ago , which wiped out 80 per cent of the species on @entity6 , the second largest extinction in the planet 's history			2
at the time , @entity6 was dominated by molluscs and arthropods , although the first vertebrate fish were beginning to appear at the time too			0
scientists have been using telescopes like this one on @entity157 , @entity158 to study gamma rays in space gamma - ray bursts , illustrated above , come from some of the biggest explosions since the @entity164 using data on the luminosity of gamma - ray bursts and what is known about their galaxies , professor @entity73 and @entity172 from the @entity77 in @entity78 calculated the likelihood of life surviving in other galaxies			1
their findings are published in the journal @entity179			0
they found that the @entity68 is just one of a rare 10 per cent of galaxies - the larger ones - that would have the ability to sustain complex life			2
professor @entity73 said , however , that it is clear that life can survive gamma - ray bursts - if the @entity6 was hit with one in the past			1
he said : ' early life forms must have been much more resilient to radiation			0
' according to the laws of physics , the speed of light is a fundamental barrier that can not be broken - nothing is supposed to be able to travel faster than it			0
so astronomers were left baffled when they spotted powerful flashes of energy bursting out from the heart of a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 260 million light years from @entity6			2
measurements of this gamma ray ' lightning ' showed it was travelling across the event horizon - the boundary where nothing can escape the intense gravity of the black hole - at rates that appeared to be faster than the speed of light			0
while the gamma rays appeared to cross the event horizon within just a few minutes , scientists estimated it should have taken light 25 minutes to pass that distance			0
this either suggests the gamma rays were travelling faster than the speed of light , or something else was going on			0
researchers believe the observations have offered them a rare insight into something that is taking place below the event horizon of the black hole - giving them a glimpse of what may be going on inside .			0

physicists calculate that powerful gamma - ray bursts *regularly* wipe out life
they found the intense radiation may have prevented complex life from evolving in 90 per cent of galaxies and left the inner @entity68 barren
gamma rays are caused by supernova explosions from collapsing stars
the radiation *destroys* *dna* and can strip away crucial atmospheric gases
the scientists also found that @entity6 may have been hit by a gamma - ray burst within the past 500 million years causing a mass extinction of life
