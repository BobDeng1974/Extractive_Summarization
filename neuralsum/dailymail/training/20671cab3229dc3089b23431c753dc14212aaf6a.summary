by @entity0 published : 13:41 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 13:43 est , 3 february 2013 an artist has created a series of out - of - this - world portraits out of maps			2
@entity5 uses everything from the roads of @entity8 to the hills of @entity10 to outline various human features			1
mr @entity5 , 23 , originally from @entity12 but now living in @entity13 , outlines the curve of an eyelash with a single street while a motorway can spread across large - scale maps creating the outline of the cheek or lips			1
intricate : @entity5 creates portraits out of maps			1
the patchwork details provided by each map are blended together to form delicate facial features the beauty of geography : mr @entity5 spends months painstakingly crosshatching the faces hidden within the topographical features he sometimes spends months painstakingly crosshatching the faces hidden within the topographical features			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i started on the map portraits in august last year following some previous work using wood to create the pattern of skin			1
‘ i enjoy working on different surfaces and playing with the context within my work while looking at different places and situations so a simple map was the result of that			0
‘ i have different rules for different maps			2
simple things like road maps i use the roads as boundaries of tones			2
most maps i wo n't draw over water as it 's featureless but they add something else to it			2
an eye for detail : mr @entity5 works on one portrait			1
a single street can outline the curve of an eyelash and each motorway can create the outline of the cheek or lips patchwork : mr @entity5 started on the map portraits in august last year following some previous work using wood to create the pattern of skin downcast : this woman looks like she 's got the weight of the world on her shoulders ‘ when i need a map i go shopping in charity shops and old book shops and pick up all sorts from there			1
i unfold them in shop to see the whole thing but always have problems getting them back together			0
‘ the shape of each map is the most important thing			0
a strong landscape format is no good they need to be in portrait orientation which there are n't many of			0
‘ in front of me i can visualise framework and if i can work with it i buy it			0
i have so many and only end up using about 10 per cent of them so my studio is full			0
’ mr @entity5 will usually spend a few weeks carefully constructing his portraits but sometimes works through the night to complete each piece within a few days			1
flexible : sometimes mr @entity5 sees a posture in the map but he says he can plot any figure on any map rules : mr @entity5 says he uses roads as boundaries of tones			1
and mostly , he wo n't draw over water as it 's featureless worlds apart : this piece features the same woman drawn on two maps with a different expression he added : ‘ sometimes i see a particular figure or posture in the map and work around that but it 's flexible - i can pretty much plot any figure on any map			1
‘ if i look at a map for long enough i will find a place to place the portrait			0
one of the things which appeals to me is how patterned they are - there is a huge network and is always a formula there			0
‘ i was working on a piece from a @entity138 map and it brought back memories of a charity hitchhike across @entity142 a few years ago many of which i had forgotten about			0
memories : mr @entity5 worked on a piece from a @entity138 map which reminded him of a charity hitchhike across @entity142 he did a few years ago ‘ you also get to discover a lot of weird place names - @entity151 certainly has a few			2
‘ all the originals i am retaining ahead of an exhibition so at the moment i 'm selling the prints which are really popular			0
‘ i have loads of other ideas of what i want to do moving forwards but i 'm pretty sure i will stick to the maps as well as i find it so enjoyable			0
