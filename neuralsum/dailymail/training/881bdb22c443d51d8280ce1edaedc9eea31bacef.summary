' however , i should point out what is obvious			0

' instead , the actions you took were thuggish and selfish			2
you caused distress , shock and fear			0
' however , mr @entity112 added : ' you took steps to ensure no one was in the house and were shocked when you realised there were people inside			0

' you are of exemplary character , having raised a family and become an employer of around 20 people			0
' in principle , custody is richly deserved			0
but this is one of those rare cases where the public interest is not served by a custodial sentence			0

@entity11 drove *vehicle* through wall of @entity13 because she was *harassing* his daughter @entity12
shouted ' that 's how you bang on a f * * * ing wall ' as he did it
but he was spared jail because a judge said police should have *intervened*
judge tells @entity11 he was ' thuggish and selfish ' in taking the law into his own hands instead of working through *official* channels
