by @entity1 reporter published : 16:00 est , 26 october 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 30 october 2013 high society hip - ster : lady @entity4 , pictured with her daughter @entity5 , has had double hip replacements it was , as always , the event of ‘ the season ’ – lady @entity4 ’s summer garden party			1
everyone who was anyone in @entity12 society was in attendance , from members of the @entity15 ( prince @entity16 and princess @entity17 and their daughter @entity19 , and @entity20 ) , to @entity21 , the wife of pop star @entity22 , @entity23 , and entrepreneur @entity24			2
there were some @entity26 , a @entity27 or two , and designer @entity28 , @entity30 ’s old drinking partner from her days partying at @entity31 , the nightclub named after her by her first husband , @entity33			1
as always @entity34 was flanked by her glamorous children – @entity5 , currently raising eyebrows by stepping out with controversial comedian @entity37 , @entity39 mp @entity38 , and financier @entity40 , who was accompanied by his model girlfriend @entity41			1
but , of course , it was the 79 - year - old widow of billionaire tycoon sir @entity45 who was the centre of attention			1
as her illustrious guests gathered around , @entity34 recalled how she had recently survived the ‘ scrum ’ at the funeral of @entity51 : ‘ the crowds were so vast			1
we had to abandon the car quite some way from @entity55 ’s and push our way through the throng			2
at that point i was grateful for my bionic hips			2
’ @entity30 was referring to her hip replacements			1
her right one was replaced 30 years ago , the legacy of a road accident when she was just three years old			1
about 70,000 @entity64 undergo such a procedure each year , but the replacement of her left hip four years ago has put @entity34 among a small number of @entity64 who have two prosthetic hip joints			1
society figure : @entity34 with her late husband sir @entity45 and their children @entity38 , now a @entity39 mp , @entity40 and @entity5 in @entity75 in 1987 typically , one in ten patients will require their replacements to be replaced as they can wear out after 15 years or so , yet @entity34 ’s first has weathered remarkably well – and she is speaking about her health today to dispel the myths that surround the matter			1
‘ yes , it was painful , ’ she says			2
‘ i did have to take a few painkillers after both operations – and i do n’t ride any more			2
i was advised against it as it can cause stress to the hips			2
' there are scars too , but in my case they have faded amazingly well , and i can hardly notice them now			2
i would definitely recommend it to anyone suffering from hip pain – if a doctor says it is suitable			1
my best advice is not to be put off by fear			2
’ bionic life : a hip replacement such as the one @entity34 has on her left recalling the original accident that triggered her problems , @entity30 says : ‘ my sister @entity104 and i had been staying with our grandparents in @entity107 , and we were being driven with our nanny to join our parents at our family home , @entity111 in @entity112			1
' i think there was a collision with a hay wagon somewhere in the @entity116			2
‘ our mother was n’t with us because she was pregnant with my younger brother , @entity118			1
' the chauffeur and nanny had cuts and bruises but my sister and i seemed fine at first			2
' however , for the next few days i was in great pain			2
nobody seemed to realise that i had been injured – my hip was literally split in two			1
' when i eventually went to the doctor , he saw that my hip was fractured			1
i have pictures of me with my leg in plaster up in the air			2
' it was mended but they obviously did not do a good job			2
’ it was when @entity34 ’s daughter @entity5 was aged ten that this childhood accident came back to haunt her			1
‘ i was in my 40s and after having six children , my right hip was starting to really hurt			1
i did n’t know why it was so painful			2
' i went to have it x-rayed and discovered that my hip had not been set properly after the accident and there was a split in it			1
' i am sure carrying weight during pregnancy brought it on			2
reluctantly , i realised i would need a new hip			1
’ at the time @entity34 was extremely fit : she was a keen horse - rider , walker and swimmer who was enthusiastically involved in all her younger children ’s games			1
‘ i was quite young to have the operation , i suppose			0
but it was no secret – everyone came to visit me during my stay in hospital			0
i was released with strict instructions to walk every day , with a stick at first , and to exercise at home			0
back in the days : @entity34 pictured with @entity28 , around the time of her first hip replacement in 1983 ‘ the message then was the same as it is now – the secret of success with a hip replacement is not just the operation or skill of the surgeon but what you do yourself afterwards			1
' the pain in the actual joint goes immediately , but you do feel sore and stiff in a different way			0
with exercise it gets a little better every day , and then after about a month you ’re back to normal			0
‘ i know some people ’s bionic joints wear out but mine has never bothered me			0
many years later i realised that i was experiencing pain in my left hip – i think i must have been putting more weight on it to alleviate any strain on my right side			1
hip replacements were first introduced in the 1960s for patients with damaged and painful joints			1
they are now performed on more people than ever			0
in the past 15 years the number of operations has increased by 50 per cent , and last year 75,000 people in the @entity64 had a hip replacement			1
the operation works by replacing the damaged ‘ ball and socket ’ joint at the top of thigh with an artificial replica			0
under general anaesthetic , the top of the patient ’s thigh bone is removed and the adjoining socket in the pelvis hollowed out			0
then a prosthetic socket is placed into the cavity and a shaft with a ball on the end is attached to the thigh bone			1
the procedure takes about an hour			0
the procedure ’s long - term safety has been called into question recently by the discovery that all - metal implants can release particles into the blood			1
traditionally the prosthetic joint comprised a metal ball and plastic socket , but it can also be made from ceramic			2
in the 1990s ‘ metal on metal ’ replacements became increasingly popular			0
concerns emerged when a number of patients with a particular brand of all - metal joints needed their surgery redone			2
it is now known that the devices wear down faster			0
an investigation found that the friction also causes tiny shards of metal to break off , which can leach into surrounding tissue , cause inflammation and entering the bloodstream			0
doctors warn the raised level of metals could prove toxic			0
guidelines say patients with the larger metal implants – about 49,000 @entity64 have them – should have annual check - ups			0
at the height of their popularity five years ago , metal joints accounted for about 15 per cent of replacements but now the number is negligible			1
@entity259 , orthopaedic surgeon at @entity260 in @entity261 , says : ‘ the more common joint remains metal on plastic			0
@entity265 is often used in young people			0
’ the choice of implant is determined by factors including the patient ’s age , activity expectation , joint deterioration and bone quality			0
the artificial joint should last at least 15 years death rates after this surgery have halved since 2003 , according to a study last month			1
mortality within 90 days now stands at just 0.29 per cent			0
‘ it had started hurting after long walks and also hurt while riding			0
eventually , i stopped putting it off and went to see my doctor			0
i did n’t have young children to chase by that time , but i had grandchildren			0
’ @entity34 was treated at the private @entity287 in @entity12 , where the @entity288 was recently a patient , and where the @entity290 received treatment for morning sickness			1
‘ i had the first operation done there too , actually , but the whole place has been done up and was much more comfortable than i remember , ’ says @entity30 of her recent operation			1
‘ this time , my surgery was carried out by @entity298 , who also operated on the @entity300 ’s hip			1
‘ i had a much shorter stay in hospital – just a few days rather than a week – and the recovery was less painful than i remembered from the first time			0
' again i was given a programme of physiotherapy , and exercise in a pool was recommended			0
i was much better with the exercises the second time around			0
i think the first time i was lazier			0
’ she adds : ‘ the first time they got me up , it was a bit daunting			0
' you think , “ oh @entity320 , if i put weight on this it is going to hurt ” , but it was surprisingly easier than i thought , and i continued to walk up and down the corridors and up and down the stairs as much as i could			0
' if you continue to do this , plus physiotherapy , the whole thing heals much faster and one will get out of hospital sooner			0
’ @entity30 , who was coy when asked about @entity5 ’s current romantic attachments ( ‘ i do not wish to speak about @entity37 ’ ) , is now enjoying ‘ running around ’ after her grandchildren , as well as keeping up with a typically busy social diary and charity work for @entity329			1
she says : ‘ my message is this : you might not want to have an operation , but no one does			0
i asked myself , “ do i want to end up crawling around in pain or do i want to just get it sorted out and get on with it ? ” ‘ i ’m not a hero or anything – people have this kind of thing all the time – but others are worried and i ’d like them not to be			0
’ @entity34 does , however , concede there is one downside to having had a double hip replacement – as the joints are typically made from metal			1
‘ whenever i go through airport security , i cause the scanners to shriek , which is rather embarrassing			0
but it ’s a small price to pay , ’ she laughs .			0

@entity30 got her first prosthetic hip 30 years ago
she recently went through with a second replacement surgery
@entity34 , 79 , is the mother of @entity5 and @entity38 and @entity357
