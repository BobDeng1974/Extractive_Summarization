a man has made the infamous shepherds pie - trifle combination of custard , jam and meat immortalised in popular tv show friends			1
on the show hapless character @entity6 decided to treat her loved ones to what she mistakenly thought was ' a traditional @entity13 trifle ' layered with all the trimmings - including ladyfingers , jam , custard , beef sautéed with peas and onions , a little more custard , bananas and some whipped cream			1
now one brave @entity24 has whipped up their own version of the unusual concoction - replacing the beef with the far more traditional lamb			1
it features sponge , jam , custard , lamb , peas , onions , whipped cream and is garnished with sprinkles @entity31 , a 32 - year - old software engineer from @entity42 , announced his plans on @entity44 with a picture of his clashing ingredients with the caption : ' it 's finally time			1
i 'm making the trifle out of friends			2
' giving a running commentary on the social media site , @entity31 proudly showed off the finished masterpiece which actually looked very respectable - until he cut into it			2
he told his followers that while it does not taste like feet - as characters on the show claimed - it was still ' f * * * * * * horrible '			2
he added : ' but with enough nice trifle stuff that we keeping eating more of it			2
' the trifle - shepherds pie combination did not look quite as appetising once it had been sliced into friends character @entity62 ( played by @entity63 ) accidentally made the disgusting dessert @entity31 posted this picture of a friend attempting a second go at the trifle pie - it does n't appear to have improved ' i thought i 'd be able to compartmentalise the clashing flavours , but i can not			1
' when @entity74 asked how it tasted , @entity31 , who shared the dish with friends , said : ' it tasted terrible of course - but not so bad that i could n't finish my slice			1
' it 's the way you sometimes think you 've got lucky and got a nice pure trifle bite and then pow ! @entity80 ! ' he said in the last year he has made curry flavoured cupcakes , a chilli cheesecake and a pancake pizza , among other things			0
' usually they kind of work , so i figured it was time to try something that definitely would n't , ' he said			0
' although when i tried sprouts in marmite that did n't work either , but it was n't as bad as this			0
' a couple of people tried it with me last night and agreed it was terrible			0
opinions were mixed on whether the lamb or the onion was the biggest problem			0
' then a couple of people at work also tried it and came to similar conclusions			0
' except for one guy who said " it was n't that bad really			0
not good , but not the worst "			0
' i 'm not sure i can trust him any more			0
' the trifle looked distinctly unappetising when dished up on a plate - and apparently tasted even worse in the show the dessert was described as half trifle , half shepherd 's pie after two pages in the @entity13 cookery book @entity6 was using stuck together - but the creators mistakenly used beef instead of the lamb which is traditional in the pie			1
towards the end of the season six episode the penny finally drops and @entity6 says : ' i was n't supposed to put beef in the trifle ! ' if for some reason you would like to recreate this @entity134 clash of flavours and textures , the recipe would appear to be : a layer of sponge , layer of jam , layer of custard , layer of raspberries , another layer of sponge , layer of lamb sautéed with peas and onions , a bit more custard , banana , and a topping of whipped cream garnished with hundreds and thousands			1
