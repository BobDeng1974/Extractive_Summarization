by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 27 august 2013 sweet tooth : @entity2 revealed that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the @entity6 resisting the temptation of sweet treats can be difficult at the best of times			1
but if you work on a cookery programme , surrounded by freshly baked goods , it seems saying ‘ no ’ is almost impossible			1
@entity2 revealed yesterday that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the @entity6			1
the 45 - year - old , who hosts the culinary contest with fellow comic @entity18 , admitted gorging on cakes , bread and quiche			1
and with the aroma of up to 12 tasty offerings being baked at once in the early stages of the competition , it is easy to understand why			1
miss @entity27 said yesterday : ‘ i ’ve put on a good 11lb every series			1
the first couple of episodes it ’s , “ no thank you , not for me ”			2
' cut to the semi-final and we ’re hoofing up whole quiches			2
’ in an interview with the @entity38 , she revealed the @entity41 show ’s production team had invested in heated belts to prevent judge @entity43 from getting too cold , but added that the devices helped to ‘ keep your stomach in ’			1
the programme , which is in its fourth series , is recorded in a tent in the grounds of @entity51 , @entity52 , and was last year marred by terrible weather , forcing the crew to come up with inventive ways of dealing with the cold			1
miss @entity27 said : ‘ when we first started filming , in april , it was freezing so our main concern was to keep @entity43 warm			1
she had four thermal layers on and two water bottles down the trousers			2
team : miss @entity27 is pictured with her fellow bake off presenters @entity66 ( bottom left ) , @entity43 ( bottom right ) and @entity18 ( top left ) ‘ this year we discovered these marvellous heated belts called “ hot trusses ”			1
i was a big fan			2
they keep your stomach in as well , which is useful as the series goes on			2
’ they are stodgy and sticky and most definitely not for dieters			2
thanks to the recession , old - fashioned puds like jam roly - poly are back on the menu at mealtimes			0
demand for school dinner - style dishes has rocketed as families turn to comfort over style – driven by our economic woes and the latest restaurant trends for retro desserts			0
a report by @entity94 the grocer yesterday revealed that sales of traditional puddings like spotted dick have climbed 42 per cent in a year			0
the latest data on the @entity100 ’s £ 169million a year hot puds market shows that bread and butter pudding is up 15.2 per cent while crumbles have enjoyed growth of 13.2 per cent			0
supermarket chain @entity104 has seen a 9.4 per cent rise in sales of puddings			0
the @entity107 said : ‘ @entity108 would be proud			0
@entity100 is rediscovering the kind of traditional , school dinner - style puddings that gave him his figure			0
downturn - driven nostalgia and comfort - eating are clearly playing their part			0
’ @entity118 , of food manufacturer @entity119 , said ‘ proper puddings ’ are emotionally satisfying in a way that a yoghurt can never be			0
miss @entity43 , 78 , revealed another downside to sampling food on the show , saying she has grown sick of cake			1
but she need not worry about the impact on her waistline , for she chooses clothes that are extra roomy to allow for layering			0
she was praised for her style when she wore a @entity134 floral bomber jacket last year , but writing in the @entity135 yesterday , she said she only chose it because there was ‘ lots of room under there for warm layers ’			0
‘ i get immensely cold while filming as the wind blows through the break in the side of the tent , so the crew always get me long - sleeved thermal underwear , ’ she said			1
not only that – she also keeps two hand warmers in her jeans back pockets .			0
