by @entity0 dressing more casually in the office may be frowned upon in many workplaces , but it could actually be helping to tackle climate change			1
researchers from @entity6 found that as more people wear hoodies , jeans and warmer clothes , offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels they used to be			1
by reducing office temperatures , it will reduce the amount of energy that is wasted , and have a positive effect on co2 emissions , and ultimately , global climates			1
researchers claim workplaces are too warm			2
office temperatures are designed for people wearing suits but as fewer people wear suits , and dress more casually in jeans and hoodies , stock image pictured , offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels			1
reducing temperatures will help tackle climate change most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22 ° c and around half the energy used in buildings is used to maintain this temperature			2
this temperature comes from professor @entity39 's thermal comfort equation from 1970			0
professor @entity39 , a @entity41 engineer , developed a method for working out how much heating and cooling would be required to keep people ' comfortable ' within buildings			1
to come to this conclusion , @entity39 made assumptions about what people wore			2
@entity39 's equation refers to a unit called the ' @entity52 ' , first developed in 1941			0
the @entity52 represents the insulation value of clothing and a man 's lightweight business suit , for example , is the equivalent to one @entity52			0
‘ standard room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default , buildings are designed for people wearing suits , ’ said professor @entity59			1
the @entity66 , based at the university , said people should be adjusting their dress codes both at work and at home , rather than the dials on their heating systems , to combat rising global temperatures			1
currently , heating and cooling systems in the office and at home are designed to provide ' comfortable ' conditions for people wearing lightweight clothing , such as suits			1
as more people wear casual , thicker clothing , these buildings need less energy			1
‘ there is no doubt that the move away from formal office wear towards jeans , hoodies and more casual clothes is reducing the need for workplaces to be heated to the same degree , ’ said professor @entity59 from the research centre			1
‘ and in hot climates , why not change dress codes rather than cooling buildings to counter the effect of wearing a suit and tie ? these are not entirely fanciful questions			1
’ she added : ‘ most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22 ° c , but very few know why this is the case			2
that figure is neither natural , nor inevitable , but is hugely important			0
most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22 ° c , stock image of a heater pictured , and almost half the energy used in buildings is used to maintain this temperature			2
researchers said much less energy would be needed if room temperatures swung with the seasons , and if people adjusted their clothing to suit ‘ around half the energy used in buildings is used to keep them at this temperature , all over the world ; whatever the weather outside			2
’ this temperature comes from professor @entity39 's thermal comfort equation from 1970			0
professor @entity39 , a @entity41 engineer , developed a method for working out how much heating and cooling would be required to keep people ' comfortable ' within buildings			1
professor @entity39 , pictured , devised the thermal comfort equation in the 1970s , by assuming what people wore at work to come to this conclusion , @entity39 - as well as heating engineers and architects ever since – made assumptions about what people wear			1
@entity39 's equation refers to a unit called the ' @entity52 ' , first developed in 1941			0
the @entity52 represents the insulation value of clothing and a man 's lightweight business suit , for example , is the equivalent to one @entity52			0
‘ standard room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default , buildings are designed for people wearing suits , ’ continued professor @entity59			1
‘ many other standards follow ; electronic technologies are typically designed to work best at 22 ° @entity160 ‘ such devices are prone to fail if they overheat and this is especially important in justifying the spread of air conditioning where none existed before			0
‘ as more and more buildings are designed to provide 22 ° c , this becomes the norm			0
it becomes what people expect and when that happens , anything other than 22 ° c begins to seem uncomfortable			0
‘ from an environmental point of view and on a global scale , the massive energy demand that ensues is unsustainable			0
‘ much less energy would be needed , if room temperatures swung with the seasons and if people adjusted their clothing - and their daily routines - to suit			2
in 2005 , the @entity187 government refused to heat or cool public buildings between 20 ° c and 28 ° c as part of its @entity192 programme			0
‘ as the @entity192 initiative demonstrates , room temperature can be redefined , ’ said professor @entity59			0
‘ looking forward , there is no reason to suppose that standards , which are normal , now , will remain so in the future			0

@entity6 claims homes and workplaces are too warm
office temperatures are *traditionally* designed for people wearing suits
as fewer people wear suits , and dress more casually , offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels
this means heat is being wasted , which has an impact on global climates
instead of heating and cooling offices , the university *recommends* dressing in hoodies and jeans
