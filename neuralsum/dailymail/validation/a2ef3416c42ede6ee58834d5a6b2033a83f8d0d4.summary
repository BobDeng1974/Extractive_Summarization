both murders were linked in 2007 after matching @entity30 was discovered on the victims , who did not know each other			1
former met police detective @entity39 believes a third woman , @entity32 - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer			1
miss @entity28 , worked as a bunny girl at the @entity12 in @entity5 's @entity44 , which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966			1
she was 22 when she was raped and killed in her home			2

she was found with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back			0
she was last seen walking alone near her home in @entity62 , @entity15 , shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in march			2
this map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked miss @entity28 , a @entity3 bunny , was last seen walking alone near her home on a snowy day in march , 1975 the @entity69 ( pictured left ) was found dead in the bedroom of her flat in @entity62 , @entity15 ( right ) she was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm			1
an hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking , apparently calmly , in her flat			0
there was no sign of forced entry			0
a blood - splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body			0
later that year , on september 3 , @entity11 was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short - cut to her home in @entity18			1
she was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead			0
a school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to @entity90 where she died a week later			0
the post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument , but the weapon was never recovered			2
police believe @entity11 was followed on foot from @entity97 into @entity98 ( pictured right ) , before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead @entity11 's mother @entity101 has now made an impassioned plea for information as the anniversary of her daughter 's death approaches			1
she said : ' it has been 40 years since our beautiful young daughter @entity11 was violently taken from us			1
' 1975 seems so long ago and it is			0
we have missed out on so much ; she missed out on life , no relationship or marriage , no career or children or even just travelling the world , all taken from her			0
' we are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like - a true life sentence			1
' mrs @entity11 added : ' we are well aware that whoever murdered @entity11 also murdered @entity11			2
that young lady also had her life snubbed out			0
her family have died now			0
' investigating officer detective chief inspector @entity127 said the suspect for both murders is likely to be in his 60s or 70s			2
he added : ' the man who carried out these murders is now of a different , older generation			0
i would imagine he must have reflected upon his actions every day over the past 40 years			1
' it 's inconceivable the killer of @entity138 and @entity11 has kept the perfect secret for 40 years			1
it 's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner , a friend , even a cellmate - and i would appeal to anyone with information to contact us			1
' police believe the killer would have known of the @entity18 area - the alleyway and sub-station where @entity11 was found were away from busy areas and meant her screams would have not been heard			1
mrs @entity11 said : ' i will make a mother 's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and @entity11 's lives to come forward			1
please , please give us some sort of closure			0
' @entity11 was beaten and raped 30 yards from her home in @entity165 , @entity18 ( left ) - she attended @entity166 ( right ) next to her house last week , former detective @entity39 pinned a third unsolved murder on the man who murdered miss @entity28 and @entity11			1
mr @entity39 , who solved the @entity172 and @entity173 cases , believes @entity32 - who was knifed to death in her home in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer			1
he told the @entity177 : ' i have no doubt the same man committed all three			0
' ' i was quickly struck by the similarities with that of @entity11			2
' a woman killed in her own home by having her throat slit ? that is rare enough today â€” in the 1970s it was almost unheard of			0
' for this to have happened twice , with identical wounds , within a few miles of each other was just too much of a coincidence			0
' he added : ' my gut feeling tells me he ( the killer ) is still out there some where and still nervous about a knock on his door			0
' ms @entity32 , a mother - of - two , was pregnant when she was stabbed to death at her home in @entity201 , @entity202 , on january 19 , 1979			2
when her daughters @entity205 , 11 , and @entity206 , eight , returned from school at 3.30pm they found the door locked and looked through the letterbox where they saw their mother 's body face down in the hall			2
the blood - stained murder weapon , a serrated carving knife , was found in the kitchen			2
witnesses described seeing a man lingering in the area , wearing a check lumber jacket and cowboy hat			0
but he was never traced			0
