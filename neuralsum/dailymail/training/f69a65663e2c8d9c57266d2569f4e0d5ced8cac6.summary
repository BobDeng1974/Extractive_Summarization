using a recipe given to them by the @entity13 and @entity15 's chef , the monks have been hit with so many orders that their website now tells customers to come back in february 2013			1
in between contemplation , study and prayer , the @entity20 monks bake over 20,000 of ' @entity25 's finest fruitcake ' each year , and inject each one with an ounce of @entity28 rum			1
but it 's just not enough			1
they were offered eight recipes and settled on the one that requires 70 per cent fruit and nuts to 30 per cent batter			0
the fruit is marinated in burgundy wine for days and the finished product injected with rum			0
