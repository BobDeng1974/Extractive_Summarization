@entity0 and @entity1 have been alerted to the possible availability of @entity4 midfielder @entity3 as @entity5 closes in on a move to the @entity7			1
the @entity9 midfielder starred for @entity10 at the @entity11 and is on the verge of sealing a dream £ 60million move to @entity16 's side			2
but his arrival will throw the future of @entity3 into doubt , with @entity20 and @entity21 both keen on a summer move for the talented playmaker			1
the 22 - year - old joined @entity4 for a fee of around £ 25m last summer , penning a five - year deal and making 32 @entity43 appearances during his first season			0
but his path to regular first - team football will be blocked when @entity5 's move is completed on wednesday			0
with @entity16 having already signed @entity48 from @entity49 for £ 24m , @entity4 could sell as many as three players to help fund their summer acquisitions			2
exit door : @entity54 midfielder @entity53 is the most likely player to leave @entity4 this summer bound for @entity55 ? @entity56 are interested in signing @entity11 winner @entity57 the £ 86m arrival of @entity59 last august meant the @entity61 giants sold @entity62 to @entity56 to help pay for the signing			1
this summer will be no different			0
@entity65 target @entity53 is candidate no 1 to move on despite @entity16 ’s insistence that the @entity67 should be kept at the club			0
the bank - breaking purchase of @entity5 will also speed up @entity4 ’s desire to move on @entity57 – possibly bringing down the £ 20m asking price for the former @entity74 midfielder , who only has one year left on his contract and is wanted by @entity56 .			1

@entity3 could struggle for playing time at @entity4 with the club set to sign @entity5 from @entity9
the @entity80 will complete his £ 60m move on wednesday
@entity20 and @entity21 could bid for @entity61 midfielder
@entity53 could also leave @entity7 as @entity4 look to fund summer signings
@entity56 target @entity57 is another player who could leave the @entity61 club after the signing @entity90 from @entity49
