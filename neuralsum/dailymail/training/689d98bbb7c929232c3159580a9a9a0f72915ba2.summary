@entity0 lit up the world title contest by putting himself on pole for the @entity3 , a race beset by what seems to be a fanciful threat of a boycott			1
the circuit of the @entity9 was meant to suit championship leader @entity10 , but his @entity12 team - mate @entity0 was nearly four - tenths faster , giving the @entity14 hope of closing his 17 - point deficit			1
it was @entity0 ’s ninth pole of the season — against @entity10 ’s seventh — yet the @entity20 has shown again and again this season how he can rise beyond his starting position with bravura race drives			1
@entity0 ( centre ) will start in pole position ahead of @entity10 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) @entity0 ( left ) shakes hands with his @entity12 team - mate @entity10 after saturday 's qualifying @entity12 ' @entity0 speeds his way to claiming pole position in the @entity32 @entity3 in @entity33 @entity0 was fastest in the second qualifying session before reinforcing his position in @entity36 @entity37 leader @entity10 finished second in @entity38 and @entity36 at the @entity39 ‘ great day , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was quite a challenge because the wind was changing			2
the start will be important			2
’ sitting next to him on the stage as he will on the grid was @entity10 , who had been fastest for most of the weekend			1
‘ i struggled with brake balance , ’ he said			0
‘ it is potentially a problem in the race			2
’ the on - track action was a merciful relief amid a febrile paddock in which @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 postured about staging a boycott in protest at how little , as they see it , of the sport ’s revenues they get			1
but can we take them seriously ? it is doubtful in the extreme that they would defy @entity69 in front of a tv audience of 350 million and a crowd of 100,000 in the most important marketplace in the sport			0
@entity69 said : ‘ forget all that crap			0
i promise you they will be racing			0
’ @entity78 has found it hard to crack @entity32 , especially after the 2005 boycott at @entity81 over safety concerns left a lingering resentment among the public towards what they see as a distinctly @entity88 series			1
@entity10 rounds a bend at the @entity33 circuit where he struggled with his brake balance saturday @entity10 takes a 17 - point lead ahead of @entity0 into sunday 's race in @entity94 @entity95 closes in on title 1 @entity10 ( @entity97 ) 291pts , 9 wins 2 @entity0 ( @entity99 ) -17 , 4 wins 3 @entity101 ( @entity102 ) -92 , 3 wins 4 @entity26 ( @entity104 ) -146 5 @entity105 ( @entity99 ) -148 6 @entity106 ( @entity107 ) -150 7 @entity108 ( @entity97 ) -197 8 @entity109 ( @entity99 ) -215 9 @entity110 ( @entity111 ) -220 10 @entity112 ( @entity113 ) -242 it was put to @entity115 , of @entity54 , that not to race would be a further , perhaps fatal , blow to the sport in the @entity32			1
he said : ‘ that ’s the last thing we want to do			0
there are three owners here who are passionate about racing , who have supported @entity78 for many years in different formats			1
the last thing they want to do is damage it , but at the moment @entity78 is damaging them big time			2
’ part of their reasoning is valid : they deserve an equitable basic share of the sport ’s revenue			0
even @entity69 admitted : ‘ the problem is that there is too much money being distributed badly			0
that ’s probably my fault			0
frankly , i know what ’s wrong but do n’t know how to fix it			0
’ but the rebels would do well to remember that @entity78 is about survival of the fittest ; it is not the welfare state			2
there is something strange about millionaires , in some cases alleged billionaires , acting like beardy beggars			0
as with everyone else , they should operate within their means rather than spend money they have not got			0
that is one lesson to be taken from @entity156 and @entity157 , the two teams who went into administration between the last race in @entity162 and this one , whose plight is the catalyst for rebellion			2
@entity169 ' @entity168 driver @entity26 passes a sparsely populated spectator hill on his way to third in qualifying @entity108 ( left ) will start in 12th after being handed a five - place penalty for changing his gearbox @entity108 finished a decent seventh on time but will have his work cut out chasing the 11 in front on sunday @entity115 added : ‘ the silence is deafening from people reaching out to help			1
it would be good for dialogue to start , for somebody to actually talk to us			0
we went through all the cost - control system with the @entity186 , but at the end of the day they could n’t deliver it because they were out - voted by the @entity190 [ comprising @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity12 , @entity193 , @entity169 , @entity55 ] , and they know that			1
it is @entity197 [ the equity firm that owns the sport ] and the @entity190 who are going to have to resolve it			0
’ @entity202 of @entity55 was the slowest of the 16 drivers , sitting out the action once the first session was over			1
did he start the boycott early ? @entity208 withdrew after going through the motions for two laps			2
the world champion took a sixth engine of the season , condemning him to start from the back of the grid , so he merely needed to get out there to qualify and that ’s all he did , keeping the miles down and his power unit fresh			0

@entity0 claims @entity32 @entity3 pole ahead of @entity10
@entity10 was quickest in @entity237 ahead of @entity110 , @entity26 and his @entity12 team - mate and championship rival @entity0 in fourth
@entity0 was fastest in @entity38 ending @entity10 's 10 - session winning streak
@entity230 , @entity231 , @entity105 and @entity202 were *elminated* in @entity237
the threat of a race boycott by @entity78 's smaller teams @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 looks unlikely to be realised
