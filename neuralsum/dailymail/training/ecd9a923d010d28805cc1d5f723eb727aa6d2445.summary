@entity0 has urged @entity2 ’s players to rewrite history and end an @entity5 hoodoo that stretches back 15 years			1
@entity2 ’s last away victory against @entity7 came on september 27 , 1999 when a goal from @entity9 settled a bad - tempered clash in which three red cards were shown			1
@entity0 ’s first venture across @entity13 as @entity2 manager ended in misery in january , as @entity7 ran out convincing 4 - 0 winners , but the @entity17 is not daunted by statistics			1
@entity0 wants his @entity2 players to rewrite history in their saturday match against @entity7 @entity0 is eager to pounce in their @entity23 clash against @entity7 at @entity5 on saturday @entity24 will travel to @entity7 in the hope of snatching three points at the famous @entity5 stadium having masterminded @entity2 ’s first win away to @entity29 in 22 years , @entity0 does not see a reason why history should be a burden to this group and believes the game offers a prime opportunity to kickstart their season			1
@entity0 said : ‘ the last time we beat @entity7 at @entity5 was september 27 , so let ’s hope it ’s the same			1
when we lost 3 - 2 to @entity49 , i said it was a bit spooky			2
it was 3 - 2 , they had three shots on target and there was three mistakes ( like last season )			2
so let ’s hope this one is as well			1
‘ it affects us in a positive way in my eyes because stats are there to be broken			2
it ’s a difficult place to go but there are many others too and we have gone and changed the stats and history			1
i look forward to that – it ’s an extra bit of motivation			2
’ if @entity2 are to do that , though , they will have to defend better than they have done this season			1
mistakes have compromised @entity2 ’s ambitions to build on last year ’s fifth placed finish and they conceded six times in their last two matches			1
the manager recognises the need to improve is immediate but he will not check his natural instincts to set up his team to attack			2
@entity0 feels this will be an open and entertaining game			1
@entity2 striker @entity78 and @entity7 goalkeeper @entity79 square up in the 1999 clash ‘ it has been an area that we have been quite poor and we need to improve , ’ @entity0 admitted			1
‘ we need to fine tune			2
you sometimes have areas where you are so good that you might take it for granted			2
you look at the experience we have in the team			0
it is just making sure the focus needs to be better			0
‘ that is clearly an area that we need to resolve			0
i think performances have been better than last season but we need to improve			0
we are a confident side			0
we want to make sure we get more focused , better communication and face the challenge to get back to the standards of last season			0
‘ we do n’t want to accept the amount of goals we have conceded			0
we do n’t want to be a team that concedes cheaply			0
i do n’t think it is in the nature of the two sides			0
we want to impose ourselves on the game			0
the city wants two teams that will grow and get better			0
we want to become as good as we can			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 has revealed that @entity112 is ready to step up his rehabilitation from knee ligament damage next week when he starts running			1
he would not , though , discuss stories linking the @entity117 midfielder with a move to @entity119 next summer			0
‘ i do n’t think it is anything to comment about , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it is a rumour and we will leave it there			0
we take it as a footballing compliment and move on			0
