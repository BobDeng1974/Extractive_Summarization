standing firm : @entity1 denies any wrong - doing and insists its planes are safe with sufficient fuel reserves ( file picture ) the decision to investigate came at a meeting of @entity3 and @entity4 air safety experts in @entity25 on tuesday			1
the investigation relates specifically to the diversion to @entity28 of a @entity1 flight from @entity30 to @entity31 on sunday			1
but it follows a spate of incidents in @entity4 airspace involving @entity37 's largest budget airline – including a number where flights have declared ‘ emergencies ’ and demanded to land because they were running low on fuel			0
in a joint statement @entity3 ’s @entity43 and the @entity4 @entity44 met ‘ to discuss oversight of @entity1 ’s operation in @entity4			2
’ they added : ’ as an example of this increased cooperation it was agreed that the circumstances of a specific incident in @entity28 airport on 16th september would be jointly examined			0
’ @entity4 authorities are also investigating emergency landings by three @entity1 planes in @entity58 on july 26 after they approached their minimum required fuel after being diverted from @entity28 because of bad weather			1
the pilots had been asked to circle above @entity64 because thunderstorms in @entity28 prevented them from landing there as planned			0
they were asked to join a queue but were given priority when they declared an ‘ emergency ’ because fuel was running close to the 30 minute minimum			0
@entity1 has said the july landings were fully in line with @entity75 safety procedures and that passengers were in no danger			2
@entity1 has also rejected claims by the @entity3 pilots ' union ( @entity79 ) that it pressures flight crew to carry the minimum amount of fuel required under @entity37 regulations			1
defence : @entity1 , whose ceo is @entity87 , pictured , has rejected claims that it pressures flight crew to carry the minimum amount of fuel required last night @entity1 ’s @entity91 said : ‘ we welcome today ’s joint statement from the @entity3 and @entity4 governments which affirms that @entity1 ’s safety standards are on a par with the safest airlines in @entity37			1
’ @entity1 said it had invited the @entity98 to send a team of inspectors to @entity25 to correct any ‘ misplaced concerns ’ about @entity1 ’s compliance with @entity37 ’s highest operating and maintenance standards			1
it was providing them ‘ with unfettered access to @entity1 operating , maintenance and flight training facilities and unlimited access to @entity1 ’s safety , flight management , engineering and maintenance personnel			1
‘ @entity4 authorities are also looking into an incident in which a @entity1 flight diverted and landed at @entity117 's @entity117 after a possible engine fault was detected			2
@entity1 has accused the @entity4 aviation authorities of falsifying information on incidents involving its planes , an accusation @entity4 officials have rejected			2
' the executives send instructions to the crew , emphasising that for every x kilos of fuel they pump in the airline loses x amount of money			0
as a consequence those in charge of the aircraft are confronted by a cost - cutting exercise that could lead them into difficult situations ' @entity140 , @entity141 the @entity142 added in their statement after the meeting : ‘ the @entity3 authorities gave an assurance of the @entity148 's rigorous oversight of @entity1 's operations and on their satisfaction with @entity1 's safety standards which are on a par with the safest airlines in @entity37			2
’ the row came as an official of the @entity4 pilots ’ union sepla criticised @entity1 for pushing legal and safety limits to the maximum			1
accident investigator and spokesman for the union ’s technical department , @entity140 warned that cost - cutting on fuel by @entity1 compromised safety stressing they were not breaking the rules but adding : ‘ they are operating on the very limits of legality			1
’ he explained : ‘ having a bit of spare fuel allows pilots to think and to make decisions , and if this variable is limited , obviously the crew ’s capacity to react is compromised , and the chances of a mistake happening are suddenly multiplied			0
’ he added : ‘ the executives send instructions to the crew , emphasising that for every x kilos of fuel they pump in the airline loses x amount of money			0
' as a consequence those in charge of the aircraft are confronted by a cost - cutting exercise that could lead them into difficult situations			0
’ in an interview on @entity4 national radio on monday , @entity140 said @entity1 ’s low fuel emergency landings were on the increase			2
it was not possible to operate an airline with ‘ this policy of pressure always working to the limits , ’ he said			0
he said if no action was taken then @entity1 was ‘ courting disaster ’			0
@entity1 last year carried more than 30 million passengers in @entity4 making it the country 's largest passenger carrier			0
