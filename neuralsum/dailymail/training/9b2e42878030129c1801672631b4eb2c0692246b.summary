by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 06:31 est , 8 february 2014 @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity5 have spotted one of the most distant galaxies ever seen			1
the galaxy , known as @entity9 , harks back to a time when our universe was only about 650 million years old , compared to its current age of 13.8 billion years			2
it is about 30 times smaller than our @entity16 galaxy and is producing about 10 times more stars , as is typical for galaxies in our young universe			1
this image of the galaxy cluster @entity22 was obtained with @entity4 's @entity23			1
the zoomed image shows the region around the @entity26 , one of the most distant galaxy candidates known , harkening back to a time when the universe was 650 million years old			2
@entity4 's @entity31 helped to narrow in on the galaxy 's great distance			1
the galaxy was found with the help of a gravitational lens : gravity from the mass in @entity22 acts to magnify the light of more distant galaxies behind it			1
these observations were part of @entity4 's @entity45 program , designed to push the limits of how far we can see into the early universe			2
the discovery comes from the @entity45 program , which combines @entity52 space telescopes			0
@entity3 sees infrared light , @entity5 sees visible and shorter - wavelength infrared light , and @entity4 's @entity55 sees x-rays			1
the telescopes are also getting a boost from natural lenses : they peer through clusters of galaxies , where gravity magnifies the light of more distant galaxies			1
the @entity45 program will image six galaxy clusters in total			0
@entity5 images of the region are used to spot candidate distant galaxies , and then @entity3 is needed to determine if the galaxies are , in fact , as far as they seem			1
@entity3 data also help determine how many stars are in the galaxy			1
these early results from the program come from images of the @entity22 galaxy cluster			0
the distance to this galaxy , if confirmed , would make it one of the farthest known			0
astronomers say it has a redshift of 8 , which is a measure of the degree to which its light has been shifted to redder wavelengths due to the expansion of our universe			0
the discovery was made using the spitzer telescope : in this previous infrared image from it , hundreds of thousands of stars crowded into the swirling core of our spiral @entity16 galaxy			1
the farther a galaxy , the higher the redshift			0
the farthest confirmed galaxy has a redshift of more than 7			0
other candidates have been identified with redshifts as high as 11			0
' just a handful of galaxies at these great distances are known , ' said @entity108 , of @entity4 's @entity109 at the @entity109 , @entity110			2
' @entity112 program is already working to find more of these distant , faint galaxies			2
' this is a preview of what 's to come			0
' the findings , led by astronomers from the @entity118 and @entity119 , set to be published in the the journal @entity120 .			0

the galaxy is about 30 times smaller than our @entity16
one of the most distant galaxies known according to @entity4
*researchers* used both @entity5 and @entity3 telescopes
