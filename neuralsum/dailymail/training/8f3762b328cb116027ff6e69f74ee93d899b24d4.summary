dozens of flights were cancelled on friday and saturday with hundreds more delays after a computer system at air traffic control company @entity10 suffered a catastrophic failure around 70 flights were cancelled on friday following the glitch , which shut down airspace over @entity28 and parts of southern @entity30 , leaving planes circling as engineers tried to fix the problem mp @entity69 , chairman of the @entity70 , said mr @entity55 will be asked about the the computer failure at @entity10 headquarters in @entity73 , @entity74 , when he appears before the panel tomorrow			1
mr @entity14 , who was paid more than £ 1million a year , including £ 272,000 in bonuses , told the @entity77 : ' the problem was when we had additional terminals brought into use and we had a software problem that we have n't seen before which resulted in the computer which looks after the flight plans effectively going off line			1
' the good news is of course that everything came back online 45 minutes later , the back - up plans went into action as they should have done , so everything performed normally there , the skies were kept safe			2
' unfortunately there was reduced capacity and i would just like to reiterate our apology that we have made to passengers and indeed to airlines and airport customers for the disruption that was caused			0
' but i think the key message is that the skies were kept absolutely safe during that 45 minutes of problems that we experienced at @entity73			2
' mr @entity14 added that it was a ' very unusual event ' which had not occurred before			2
airlines are claiming the unprecedented it failure was beyond their control - which enables them to dodge compensation claims from passengers			2

this particular glitch was buried in one of those four million lines of code			0
' nats gave the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) a report earlier this year following major disruption caused by a communications problem last december			2
@entity10 bosses were told months before this weekend 's flight chaos that their contingency plans for technical failures lacked ' detail and clarity '			0
the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) told @entity10 earlier this year , after disruption to flights last december , that they needed to be better prepared for computer glitches , the @entity147 on sunday reported			1
around 300 flights were cancelled after last year 's technical failures , leading the @entity137 to ask @entity10 to explain how they would ensure it would not happen again			1
the regulator said ' themes on avoiding a recurrence ' were a ' good first step but lack detail and clarity '			0
a spokesman for the @entity137 said the report lacked detail			0
' we asked them to do a little bit more work on it , ' he said , adding that @entity10 said this weekend 's chaos was unrelated to what caused last december 's disruption			2
despite thousands of passengers qualifying for up to £ 470 in compensation because of the long delays and cancellations , airlines may not have to pay up because of an @entity177 loophole allowing them to refuse to pay out if the issue was caused by ' extraordinary circumstances '			1
it is unclear whether the computer glitch falls into that category , with experts warning that passenger payouts are not a certainty			2
under @entity177 rules , delayed passengers can claim compensation if they arrive at their destination more than three hours late			1
there are differing limits on payouts which depend on the length of the delay and how far the intended destination is away			0
but airlines can refuse to pay up if the issue which caused the delay was out of their control			0
some airlines used this clause as reason not to pay out after the @entity206 volcano ash cloud caused chaos in 2010 .			0
