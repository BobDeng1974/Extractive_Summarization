@entity0 is 34 years old			1
he has been at @entity1 for nine years , but has averaged just 19 @entity3 games a season under @entity5			1
yet , when the ‘ @entity0 ’ is at his best , @entity5 ’s fluid style of play is rarely encapsulated more			2
his individual masterclass at @entity9 in the @entity10 on sunday typified the type of performance @entity1 fans have grown to love , full of energy , pressing on and off the ball and flair			1
@entity17 may want to ‘ two - foot him ’ , but really , we must saviour the moments when the @entity21 star lights up a football pitch with his touch			1
@entity0 gives a ' no look ' pass during the build - up to his spectacular goal against @entity9 the @entity21 midfielder used the same move a number of times during @entity1 's 3 - 2 win against @entity9 ‘ if you love football , you love @entity0 , ’ @entity5 gleamed after the 3 - 2 victory			1
@entity36 and @entity37 returned for the @entity38 , but were dictated by the midfield maestro on the @entity40			0
@entity0 is an odd footballing creature , someone who can go missing when he ’s not found his rhythm , someone who is more likely to put in the performance of the season than nail down a position in the starting @entity48 in fact , he looked set for a january departure before injuries played their part in north @entity53			1
@entity0 celebrates his goal while @entity55 ( centre ) rushes over to congratulate him former @entity58 goalkeeper @entity57 dived too late to keep out @entity0 's perfectly executed strike ‘ the lack of match practice has been absolutely terrible and , naturally , it makes me very sorry that i have n’t been given a chance yet , ’ @entity0 said back in september			1
a limp outing in his first start of the campaign against @entity66 in the @entity67 did nothing for him , and even had some sections of the @entity71 crowd booing			0
this was not the @entity0 they knew and loved			2
but @entity0 is always a man @entity5 rates so highly , and is perhaps his most trusted member of the first team squad			2
year in , year out , he comes into form when @entity1 need him most , from december to may			2
the @entity79 boss has always been firm with players aged 30 or older when it comes to new deals in the past , but not with @entity0 , who has signed on in march in two of the last three seasons			0
he will get a testimonial next year if he opts for a contract extension at the club			0
@entity0 ( left ) , despite his inconsistent form , is rated very highly by @entity38 boss @entity5 at @entity90 , when @entity91 ran the show , faith was placed in @entity0 to come on for @entity93 and steer the ship home			0
his knowledge of where to run with the ball when defending a lead , and when to bring out the flicks and tricks , is all so important			0
he mixes the experience of a 34 - year - old with the exuberance of a young teen trying to make a point			0
you might say it ’s the perfect combination			0
@entity0 has had to change his game over the years			1
a career - threatening injury back in 2008 kept him out of action for almost two years			1
he insists his ‘ football age ’ is 32 because of it , while some call him @entity115			0
before that hamstring problem , the playmaker was one of the few in the @entity1 squad who seemed keen to pull the trigger , with a ferocious shot from a short back - lift			1
@entity0 ( left ) was a calming influence from the bench as he helped @entity1 close out a 2 - 0 against @entity90 now , his burst of pace from midfield is more evident , his selflessness and weight of pass usually to perfection			1
at @entity9 , we got to see all sides to his game			0
the ball through to @entity36 for the @entity38 ’s second goal of the game was effortless , the no - look pass and subsequent volley past goalkeeper @entity57 sublime			1
@entity0 earned his ‘ @entity0 ’ name back in @entity142 with @entity143 , but the nickname has never been more suitable than for the man we see today			1
the game @entity5 tries to play is all about finding angles and avenues in and around the opposition midfield			0
different trajectories and speed of pass is ‘ the @entity1 way ’			0
in @entity0 , he has a player that will always look for the forward pass , finding miniscule gaps to thread balls through , eager for one - twos and runs beyond the defence should they be needed			2
@entity0 earned his ‘ @entity0 ’ nickname during his younger days with @entity143 the midfielder has come through a difficult era with @entity1 , often a barren one , to become the player he is today , an intelligent technician to compliment the likes of @entity91			1
the duo , best friends off the pitch , have both been praised in recent weeks , and @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity55 will struggle to oust them from the side on current form			0
however , @entity0 for one will know the time will come this season when he plays second fiddle once again			2
not usually one for the limelight , more one for the highlight reel , there are n’t many left like the @entity182 captain			0
we should appreciate this conductor while we still can			0
the likes of @entity186 ( left ) and @entity37 will struggle to oust the in - form @entity0			2

@entity0 starred in @entity1 's 3 - 2 @entity10 victory against @entity9
the @entity21 star lit up the match with a sublime volleyed goal
@entity0 , 34 , has been at @entity1 for nine years
but he has averaged just just 19 @entity3 games a season
a serious back injury in 2008 kept him out of action for almost two years
