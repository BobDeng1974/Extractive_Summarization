published : 16:04 est , 4 may 2014 updated : 09:07 est , 5 may 2014 @entity1 's players and their families gathered at @entity3 on sunday for a children ’s fun day organised by interim manager @entity5 knowing that the party is almost over			1
for a number of the squad , tuesday ’s match against @entity8 will be their last appearance at @entity12			1
for others , that moment has already passed			2
hours later , @entity15 is set to be confirmed as manager and life will never be quite the same again			1
if there is one beneficiary beyond @entity21 from @entity1 ’s 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity23 on saturday , it ’s @entity24			1
instead , after @entity5 ’s opening 4 - 0 win over @entity54 , it was as bad as anything we have witnessed this season with @entity1 showing a chronic lack of pace and ingenuity			1
@entity61 and @entity62 – who was linked with a move to @entity64 over the weekend – were wretched , @entity65 once again failed to seize his opportunity in the absence through injury of @entity69 , while @entity70 and @entity71 looked well past their best			2
afterwards @entity5 wore the puzzled look and gave the vague answers that people came to expect from @entity47			2
none of them are safe from the @entity24 revolution as he prepares to take a £ 150million wrecking ball to the empire that sir @entity81 built			2
on his way : @entity1 winger @entity62 , pictured being challenged by @entity83 , has been linked with @entity64 @entity84 , who is still undecided about his future at @entity12 , is in no doubt that the players are to blame for @entity1 ’s worst @entity89 season on record by quite some stretch			1
‘ it ’s not about the manager , ’ said @entity84			1
‘ you have to take responsibility , every player			2
the young players , the senior players			2
this year everyone has failed			0
you should be there and it ’s been a disaster			0
a nightmare to forget really quickly			0
‘ you always feel responsible even when @entity47 was in charge			0
when i spoke with him , i put the players before everything because we are on the pitch			0
i never point at anyone else			0
summed it up : @entity84 admitted it has proved very difficult without sir @entity81 this season ‘ sir @entity81 was the heart of @entity1			1
you can not replace him so quickly and we knew it would be difficult , but not this difficult			0
‘ we can do much better than we have			0
maybe not win the league but at least qualify for the @entity116 with the players we ’ve got			0
we deserve all the criticism			0
we did n’t play well enough			0
we lost some stupid games and that ’s why we ’re in this position			1
‘ but i really think it ’s an accident			0
i know @entity1 will never die , and also that we ’ll come back next year			1
’ @entity69 did some light training over the weekend as he eases his way back from a groin strain but it remains to be seen if he will be involved against @entity8 .			1
