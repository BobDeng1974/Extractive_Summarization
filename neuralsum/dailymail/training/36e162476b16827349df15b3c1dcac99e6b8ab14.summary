by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 have pulled of one of the greatest comebacks in the club 's 47 - year history after a hellish week that claimed one of their star players			1
the embattled club ended their week with a win against the premiers coming from 24 - 0 with only half an hour on the clock to triumph over the @entity15 30 - 28 in the boilover of the season at @entity19 's @entity18 on saturday			1
it came a week after @entity22 player @entity21 was sensationally sacked from the club when a photo of him engaged in lewd behaviour in a bathroom at @entity29 nightclub in @entity2 emerged on social media on june 28			1
the photo of @entity21 engaged in a lewd act in the bathroom of a @entity2 nightspot that started a horror week for the club closely following @entity21 's departure was @entity2 coach @entity47 who resigned two days later			1
but what makes the win even more miraculous is that it comes nine days after they also beat out the @entity52 coming from 22 points down just after half - time to triumph 24 - 22 in 33 minutes			1
two days after the scandal broke , @entity21 spoke out about the shocking photo , explaining he did not know it was ' out there ' and hoped it did not end his football career			1
' it ’s just disappointing for something that i did n't know was out there , something that ’s surfaced like this , ' he told @entity67			0
the disgraced @entity69 star explained he ' felt sick ' when he found out the photo , which he said was just a ' prank ' , was being shared across the internet			2
' to receive the message on saturday night , it ’s just gut - wrenching , it made me feel sick straight away , ' he said on the monday following the photo 's appearance			2
@entity21 revealed he felt ' betrayed ' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board , but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain			0
as a result of the @entity21 scandal , the @entity2 were also left without coach @entity47 @entity15 ' @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) were shell - shocked after the premiers lost to the @entity2 despite a tough week , @entity2 fans were proudly flying the team colours it looked bad for the @entity2 at half time , not scoring any points in the first half after these heavy blows to the club , it seemed unlikely things would look up for the bottom - placed @entity2			1
during saturday 's game , @entity99 was paying $ 101 at half - time for a @entity2 win			1
but even coachless and without their star player , halfback @entity103 was able to pull off some match - winning magic in the last three minutes before full - time , scoring a try , and with a conversion from fullback @entity110 they left the @entity15 shell - shocked			1
' i saw some odds in the paper			0
what were we - 50 to one or something ? it was ridiculous			0
no one gave us a hope , ' stand - in sharks captain @entity120 said after the win			2
' the funny thing about rugby league players is that most of them have a little bit of attitude and , if you write them off , they like to step up to the mark and say i told you so			0
' it was just a super effort from the boys			0
' the odds were against @entity2 at half - time , with @entity99 paying $ 101 for a @entity2 win @entity2 ' @entity139 scored a try to help his team on the way to their 30 - minute claw back the @entity2 played the @entity15 without coach @entity47 and star player @entity21 the @entity2 had plenty to celebrate ( right ) after tries from @entity139 ( left ) and @entity103 @entity120 said the @entity148 saga that has plagued the club for a season and a half had steeled the @entity2			1
' over the last 18 months , we 've gotten pretty good at putting distractions to the side and just focusing on footy and last week was no different , ' he said			0
' we got together on monday , we had our say [ about @entity21 's sacking ] and by tuesday morning it was over			2
we put it to bed			0
' @entity148 has been investigating the @entity2 over the banned use of injections , creams and tablets in issue in 2001 over an 11 - week supplements program			2
since the investigation , the @entity2 have been left desperate to find major sponsors as a result of continual bad press over the drug probe			0
@entity2 are currently at the bottom of the @entity69 ladder , with a drug investigation also hanging over their heads			0

sharks came from 24 - 0 to win over the premiers - the @entity15
it took them only half an hour to reach 30 - 28 before the full - time siren
this win comes after @entity2 also won over the @entity52 nine days *ago*
in that match , they came from 22 points down to win 24 - 22 in 33 minutes
the win comes after the sensational sacking of star @entity21
his contract was ripped up after a photo of him engaged in lewd behaviour emerged
