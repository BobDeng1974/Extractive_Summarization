dame @entity0 has condemned politicians for pushing ' @entity2 ' dame @entity0 , the renowned primate expert , has condemned ‘ deluded ’ politicians for pushing ‘ @entity2 ’			1
the highly respected academic has endorsed a new book , which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers			1
historically , critics of @entity13 food have been lambasted by the @entity13 companies , scientists who rely on their funding , and politicians , including the @entity18 , as being ‘ anti-science ’			1
however , @entity19 argues that the advocates of @entity13 food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘ anti-science ’			1
the intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , have forced @entity13 crops and food on to dinner plates in the @entity35 without proper safety tests			1
and she is joining a growing campaign warning that @entity39 and @entity40 must not drop safeguards that have kept @entity13 crops out			1
dame @entity19 ’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book , ‘ @entity47 , @entity48 ’ , which is written by the @entity35 public interest lawyer , @entity46			1
its publication comes as the @entity35 is seeing a growing backlash against @entity52 last week it emerged that the country ’s favourite chocolate manufacturer , @entity55 , is to drop @entity13 from its products			1
dame @entity19 said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘ shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet ’			0
she said the @entity13 process , which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them			2
however , she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘ fraud ’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding			2
she said : ‘ this very real difference between @entity13 plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure			2
as part of the process , they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific , but anti-science			0
‘ they then set to work to convince the public and government officials , through the dissemination of false information , that there was an overwhelming expert consensus , based on solid evidence , that the new foods were safe			2
yet this , as @entity46 points out , was clearly not true			0
’ importantly , she claims , the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support			0
‘ @entity46 describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths			0
moreover , it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions , as well as many eminent scientists , were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation			0
’ dame @entity19 is considered to be the world ’s foremost expert on chimpanzees			0
she is best known for her 55 - year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in @entity120 , @entity121			0
she was made a dame in 2004 and holds many other awards for her environmental and humanitarian work , including the @entity124 in @entity125 , the @entity126 , the @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity127 ’ s @entity128 and the @entity129			0
the @entity39 government has signalled that it plans to use a new @entity13 crop approval process to push ahead with growing the crops in this country			1
separately , a new trade agreement between the @entity135 and the @entity35 , which is called @entity136 , could make it much easier for @entity13 foods from @entity138 to appear on shelves here			1
however , @entity19 warns it would be an enormous risk to accept the technology and describes mr @entity46 as a hero worthy of a @entity144 for lifting the lid on the truth about @entity13 dame @entity19 endorsed a new book , which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers ( file picture ) she describes his work as one of the most important books of the last 50 years , and adds : ‘ it will go a long way toward dispelling the confusion and delusion that has been created regarding the genetic engineering process and the foods it creates			1
‘ although this book tells a story that ’s in many ways distressing , it ’s important that it has finally been told because so much confusion has been spread and so many important decision - makers have apparently been deluded			0
’ mr @entity46 , who gave a press conference in @entity171 yesterday ( wed ) , has challenged @entity39 ’s @entity172 to apologies for its pro-gm stance and its part in rubbishing scientists who have safety doubts over the crops and food			1
his work points to research which has found tumours , liver and kidney harm in animals given @entity13 feed in trials			2
and he complains , that researchers who dare to raise these problems have been pilloried			0
he said : ‘ contrary to the assertions of its proponents , the massive enterprise to reconfigure the genetic core of the world ’s food supply is not based on sound science but on the systematic subversion of science – and it would collapse if subjected to an open airing of the facts			2
’ @entity202 , director of the campaigning group @entity13 , warned the @entity136 trade talks mean @entity39 and @entity40 could see a flood of biotech crops and food arriving here			1
she said : ‘ @entity210 ’s investigation into the history of fraud and deceit that ushered in the era of @entity13 deserves serious consideration before we take actions that will irreversibly alter the @entity40 food supply ’			1
dr @entity219 a spokesman for @entity221 was not aware of @entity223 's book			2
he said : ' we are now up to the three trillion meals and counting , that is meals containing @entity13 ingredients , without a single substantial health issue since the beginning of the technology			0
' there has been much dirt thrown but none of it has stuck			0
' on its website @entity30 say they place the ' highest priority ' on the safety of their products and conduct ' rigorous and comprehensive testing on each			0
' they state : ' in fact , seeds with @entity13 traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals			1
' in addition , governmental regulatory agencies , scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree on the safety of @entity13 crops			0
' a spokesman for the company added : ' the denial of the safety of @entity13 seeds and food ingredients is as baseless as the denial of clearly documented climate change			2
' countless peer - reviewed scientific studies performed with biotech crops — including more than 100 feeding studies — have confirmed their safety , as reflected in the respective safety assessments by regulatory authorities around the world			0
