the @entity0 completed its investigation last week into sgt. @entity3 's disappearance from a base in @entity5 five years ago , but the @entity6 said tuesday that it does n't know when the report will be released			1
' the investigating officer has done his work , but now that work is moving through the @entity0 system , and at each stop ... there will ... be questions , requirements for clarification , ' army colonel @entity8 told reporters			1
' so it 's working its way through the system as would any other investigation			0
' the results of the @entity0 's probe into whether @entity3 deserted his post will most certainly be withheld from the public until after november 's elections , if it discloses its findings at all			1
platoon mates of @entity3 say he deserted but the @entity0 is yet to release its formal report the @entity6 's announcement has @entity39 and former platoon mates of @entity3 's wondering what 's taking so long , as the facts of the case appear fairly cut and dried on the surface			1
according to soldiers who served with @entity3 , the 28 - year - old willingly abandoned his base several days before he was kidnapped by the @entity35 and taken hostage in june of 2009			2
for nearly five years he was held captive by the terrorist organization until president @entity33 and the @entity6 negotiated his release last may			1
acting on his own authority , @entity33 traded five @entity35 commanders who were being held in detention at @entity53 for the release of @entity3 , who is now living and working at a base in @entity56 , @entity57			1
@entity3 has not spoken out publicly since his return to the @entity59 and has reportedly refused to meet with his family in person			2
in june the @entity0 announced that maj. gen. @entity62 , a veteran of two tours in @entity5 , would lead it 's official review of @entity3 's conduct			1
the two - star general , who also serves as the deputy commanding general of @entity69 at @entity70 in @entity71 , interviewed @entity3 in august			0
if cleared of wrong doing , sgt. @entity3 stands to receive $ 200,000 in back pay and $ 150,000 compensation for his troubles			0
the @entity0 said on friday that it had received @entity62 's report and its ' reviewing it , ' but it has no timeline for the completion of its audit			1
' as we stressed at on the onset , this will be a lengthy process conducted in accordance with applicable laws , regulation and policy , ' @entity0 officials said in a statement			0
' we recognize the importance of the media and the public understanding of our investigative process , and look forward to future discussions on this issue			0
the statement went on to say that ' the @entity0 's priority is ensuring that our process is thorough , factually accurate , impartial , and legally correct			2
' ' consequently , at this time , it would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential results or the amount of time the review process will take to complete			0
' @entity104 says that @entity105 , the @entity6 's spokesperson , denied on tuesday that the military was postponing the release of the report until after @entity109 in order to give the president and his his political party cover from the potentially damning details of the probe			1

the truth , he said , is that @entity3 deserted			2
' there 's not one person [ from his platoon ] who disagrees , ' @entity132 claimed but members of @entity3 's unit say they do n't understand why the @entity0 's assessment is taking so long			1
@entity3 's former platoon leader , sgt. @entity132 , has said on numerous occasions that after @entity3 , then a private in the army , went missing , soldiers in his unit learned from locals they were observing over the radio that an @entity59 was wandering around town , looking for someone who spoke @entity165 so that he could communicate with the @entity35			1
' we 've come out when he first got released , and we explained exactly what happened			2
he deserted his post , all on his own , and we 're now still sitting here waiting for answers , ' @entity132 told @entity137 host @entity136 on tuesday evening			1
@entity132 said he was interviewed @entity171 and had a ' lengthy ' conversation with him about the details of @entity3 's disappearance , including the chatter the platoon heard over the radio			1
' i have a list of the people that the general spoke to during this investigation , ' @entity132 told @entity136			0
' it 's everyone from the platoon , and i know exactly what they said			0
' there 's no way that they can conclude this investigation without the truth			0
' the truth , @entity132 said , is that @entity3 deserted			2
' there 's not one person [ from his platoon ] who disagrees , ' @entity132 said			0
another former platoon mate of @entity3 's , sgt. @entity197 , said wednesday on @entity135 that he 's also suspicious of delay , given that the military had ' five years to investigate this , talk to everyone who was there , who was involved , talk to the family , check the emails , look at the facts			1
' ' the only thing that was missing here , the only piece , is @entity3 himself talking to him , ' he said			0
@entity197 suggested that part of the problem is that @entity62 is not qualified to conduct the probe			0
' i really want to see the line of questioning presented by @entity215 given that he is not an army investigator , ' @entity197 said			0
sgt. @entity3 is pictured here in an undated photo provided to reporters by the @entity0			1
if @entity3 is cleared of desertion charges , he 'll receive $ 200,000 in back pay and stands to gain another $ 150,000 in compensation for his ordeal he later referred to @entity62 as a ' general that has no experience ' leading ' a line of questioning in a criminal investigation			0
' ' what are gen. @entity62 's credentials ? ' he asked			0
@entity197 said if the @entity0 does n't release its finished review to the public , he and other members of @entity3 's platoon would ' look into filing a @entity236 ' to obtain the report			1
@entity135 's @entity238 , who was filling in this morning for regular @entity135 host @entity239 , commented that it seemed ' very politically expedient ' that the @entity0 is delaying the release of its report until after the election			1
on tuesday night , @entity136 noted that ' the @entity0 says politics has nothing to do with ' the protracted wait			2
' i 'm not sold , ' he said			0
army lieutenant colonel @entity133 , a frequent @entity135 guest , told @entity136 later in the show that he , too , believes the @entity33 administration may have asked the @entity0 to sit on the verdict of its investigation until after nov. 4			0
' when it comes to why it 's being withheld , it 's obvious			0
it 's got ta be withheld until after the election because no matter which way the report goes , @entity33 loses , ' he said			0
' if the @entity259 was able to exert sufficient pressure on the chain of command in the @entity6 to whitewash @entity3 's actions , then there 's gon na be this huge outcry from those serving in uniform , from veterans from conservatives , ' he noted			1
on the other hand , he said , ' if it turns out that the @entity0 got some backbone and really looked at what @entity3 did , listened to people like @entity274 and his platoon mates , and finds that , yes , he should be charged with desertion , well then the @entity270 ceremony looks like an even greater debacle			1
' ' so @entity33 has dug himself into a very deep hole , and he ca n't stop digging , ' he said , referring to a news conference the president held at the @entity259 on the day of @entity3 's release with the sergeant 's parents			1
@entity133 claimed that he has ' nothing personal ' against sgt. @entity3 and that he 's never met him			2
' this is about a much greater issue than one individual who appears to have deserted from his post and left his comrades behind in war time , ' he explained			2
' the principle is this : the @entity33 administration really despises our military , in my view			0
and they understand why @entity3 would desert , they just do n't understand why anybody would join the military			2
returning back to the topic at hand , @entity133 said that ' if there 's a whitewash , and @entity3 walks with all his back pay and stuff , the travesty , the precedent it sets for all future wars is that , " hey dude , it 's ok , man			2
you do n't like what 's going on , walk away , we 'll cover for you			0
" ' that 's profoundly wrong , ' he concluded .			0

the @entity0 completed its probe into @entity3 last week , but the @entity6 said tuesday it does n't know when the report will be released
*republicans* and former platoon mates of @entity3 's are wondering what 's taking so long
' we explained exactly what happened . he deserted his post ... and we 're now still sitting here waiting for answers , ' @entity3 's former platoon leader said
if the @entity0 does n't release its finished review to the public , a member of @entity3 's platoon said he may file a @entity236 request
