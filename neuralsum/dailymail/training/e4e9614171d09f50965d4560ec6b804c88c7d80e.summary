women 's @entity42 chief executive @entity41 said : ' this is an incredibly exciting time in the @entity6 's long history			1
@entity9 being on the brink of being the first woman to win the @entity6 represents a pivotal moment in the sport			1
' sibling success : @entity9 is congratulated by her brother @entity26 after her win on @entity52 at @entity40 in 2010 she added : ' it is important to recognise that women can compete on equal terms with men in this event , and that their achievements as top athletes are recognised			1
' having a female athlete come top in such a prestigious and well - loved race will be a breakthrough moment for women in sport			2
' @entity9 will be riding @entity66 , the same mount with which she took third place in last year 's race			0
her brother @entity15 , a double @entity6 winner , rides on his own , and together they are riding two of this year 's most - fancied horses			1

‘ the @entity9 family are racing royalty and have a great history with the @entity6 , @entity15 has ridden two winners and @entity18 has trained one already , ’ a spokesman for @entity92 said			2

‘ despite her amateur status , she is a very experienced rider and there is no doubt @entity9 and @entity66 will be giving all the boys a run for their money on saturday			0

if @entity9 wins she would also be the first amateur victor since @entity133 steered mr @entity134 to victory in 1990			0
her amateur status also means she does not get paid for the ride and would not receive the normal professional jockey 's seven per cent of the prize money , nearly £ 40,000 if she won the @entity6 .			1
