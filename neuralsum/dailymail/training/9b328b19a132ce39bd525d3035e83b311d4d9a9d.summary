by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:15 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 02:31 est , 5 june 2013 food and energy prices are rising faster in @entity5 than anywhere else in @entity7 as the crippling squeeze on household finances continues , a major report said yesterday			1
the @entity11 said food prices in april were 4.6 per cent higher than in the same month last year , while energy prices were up 2.2 per cent			1
the rate of inflation in the @entity5 was far higher than elsewhere in @entity7 and underlined the crisis facing families as they struggle to make ends meet			1
food prices in april were 4.6 per cent higher than in the same month last year , according to the @entity11 inflation has been above the @entity20 's 2 per cent target since late 2009 as the cost of everyday essentials such as food soars			1
household energy bills have also risen sharply in recent years – eating into household budgets at a time when wages are growing only very slowly , if at all			0
the increasing cost of living threatens to undermine the fragile economic recovery as consumers find themselves with less to spend each month			1
it also puts @entity5 at a disadvantage to the rest of @entity7 and the @entity34			0
the @entity11 said food prices were up 3.7 per cent in @entity36 in april , 1.6 per cent in @entity37 and just 1 per cent in the @entity34			1
the report from the @entity40 - based think tank said energy prices in @entity5 were rising at more than four times the rate seen in @entity36			0
in nearly a dozen @entity7 countries energy bills fell in april – including in @entity37 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the @entity11 said the overall rate of inflation in @entity5 slowed from 2.8 per cent in march to 2.4 per cent in april			1
but this was still well above the 1.2 per cent seen in @entity36 , 1.1 per cent in @entity51 and 0.7 per cent in @entity37 and the @entity20 expects inflation in @entity5 to rise again in the coming months			1
the report came just a day after the @entity54 , @entity5 's leading economic forecaster , said the average family with two children will be £ 1,800 worse off by 2015 than they were in 2008			2
inflation has been above the @entity20 's 2 per cent target since late 2009 as the cost of everyday essentials such as food soars while overall shop prices fell across the country in may , as retailers slashed prices in ' desperation sales ' , food prices continued to outpace increases in pay with a rise of 2.4 per cent , according to the @entity71 ( @entity71 )			1
it said shop price inflation in may was -0.1 per cent – the first time there has been an annual fall in three - and - a - half years , but this was driven by non-essential items			2
the biggest falls were seen among fashion and shoe stores , where average prices were down by some 5.7 per cent			0
that means a coat that was reduced from £ 250 to £ 150 in a sale in 2012 , would have been cut from £ 250 to around £ 140 in may this year			2
the study said the average price of electrical goods was down by 5.2 per cent in may against a year ago , largely because many tablets , tvs and other devices have come down in price amid fierce competition , particularly from online retailers			2
there were also price falls for furniture , carpets , diy and gardening products			0
@entity100 , the director general of the @entity71 , said : ' times remain tough , but it seems retailers are reading the market well and doing what they can to offer customers the best possible value on their shopping			0
' @entity109 , economist at researchers @entity111 , said consumer spending over the coming months will be ' crucial to the economy 's performance '			2
he added : ' inflation is still likely to rise to around 3 per cent during the summer despite dipping to 2.4 per cent in april from 2.8 per cent in march			1
' energy price tariffs are in a constant @entity117 with suppliers constantly battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			2
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price .			0

@entity11 said food in april was 4.6 **%** dearer than same month last year
