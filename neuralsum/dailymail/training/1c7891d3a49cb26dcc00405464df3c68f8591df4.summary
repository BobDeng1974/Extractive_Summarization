by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 05:48 est , 19 april 2013 health secretary @entity1 wants only permanent @entity3 residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care foreigners travelling to @entity3 to take advantage of our free health service will be denied treatment under radical plans for a shake - up of the system of personal @entity15 identification numbers			1
health secretary @entity1 wants only permanent @entity3 residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge			1
he believes @entity20 residents are granted @entity15 numbers – which entitle them to free care – far too easily			1
in many cases , anyone who turns up at a gp surgery is given a number			0
on referral to hospital , no further questions about their entitlement are asked – meaning that ‘ health tourists ’ or those who have fallen ill unexpectedly while in this country are given unlimited free access to the @entity15 , @entity32 sources say			2
mr @entity1 said the system was ‘ completely unacceptable ’			1
he has proposed that in future , anyone with a ‘ questionable ’ residency status should be issued with only a temporary @entity15 number			1
it would mean that if they tried to access anything other than accident and emergency departments , they would be charged			0
‘ it is completely unacceptable that people are abusing the @entity15 and accessing free care they are not entitled to , ’ the health secretary told the @entity49			1
‘ changing the way the @entity15 number is used is just one stage of my plan to shut down free @entity15 care for those who are not entitled to it			2
’ it is expected that hospitals or surgeries would be under a new obligation to check whether patients are entitled to free care			0
they would be able to refer cases to a central body – probably @entity69 – which would determine what should be charged			0
sources said a consultation will determine the best way of requiring people to prove residency , possibly through council tax records or the electoral roll			0
the government has promised a crackdown on health tourism , but until now it has been unclear how it would work			0
unacceptable : mr @entity1 has proposed that in the future anyone with a questionable residency should be issued with a temporary @entity15 number ministers have also been criticised for underestimating the scale of the problem , with official statistics suggesting it costs taxpayers around £ 20million a year			1
but earlier this month the @entity49 revealed a senior doctor ’s warning that the true cost is likely to run into billions of pounds			0
professor @entity93 , consultant surgeon at the @entity94 in @entity95 , said the @entity15 had become the ‘ world ’s maternity wing ’ as foreign expectant mothers arrive just to give birth			2
thousands of others are flying here for cancer , hiv , kidney and infertility treatment then leaving without paying , he said			0
he cited one example of a foreign patient arriving in renal failure on a visitor ’s visa and had 849 dialysis sessions on the @entity15			0
he called for an overhaul of the system of @entity15 numbers , saying : ‘ those who work and pay tax here , and have a national insurance number to prove it , ought to be granted full access to the @entity15			1
‘ but it makes no sense to accord this right to visitors , especially when an @entity15 number can translate seamlessly into expensive long - term hospital care			2
’ mr @entity1 will unveil his proposals for an overhaul in a document on health tourism to be published in the next few months			1
anyone whose chargeable status was in question would in future receive a number that only gives temporary access , for example if they needed lifesaving treatment			0
a @entity139 source said : ‘ the system and processes we have in place to identify those who should pay are weak or poorly implemented			0
‘ often , @entity15 numbers are allocated after a person registers at a @entity147 practice , where current charging rules do not apply			1
on referral to secondary care with an @entity15 number , too often no further questions about entitlement are asked			2
’ hospitals in @entity69 and @entity155 are supposed to ensure @entity15 patients have lived in the @entity20 for the previous 12 months , and chase payment for non-emergency treatment from visitors			1
but dozens of hospital trusts admit they do not check .			0

@entity1 believes @entity20 residents are granted @entity15 numbers too easily
mr @entity1 said the system was completely unacceptable
he proposed anyone with a ' questionable residency ' should be issued with a temporary number
