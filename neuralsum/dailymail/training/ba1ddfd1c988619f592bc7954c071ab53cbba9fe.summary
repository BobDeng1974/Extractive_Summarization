by @entity0 , @entity1 footballers in @entity3 are confident the game at its highest levels is clean of the scourge of match - fixing , a survey conducted by international players ' union @entity9 has revealed			1
over 1,500 players from eight countries - @entity3 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 - submitted responses to a questionnaire that tested their knowledge about the extent of fixing , approaches to fix matches , sharing inside information and betting rules			1
it further examined their beliefs in respect of the extent of fixing , the instigators and causes , prevention and education , as well as enquiring as to who they would trust to report information on match - fixing , how they would prefer to report information , and reasons that might prevent them from doing so			2
protest : a @entity44 supporter backs his team before the match following allegations of match fixing other assessments included their practice in reporting approaches , their likelihood to report information , and their own betting practice			2
an assumption of the survey was that the majority of players are not involved in match - fixing and would therefore answer truthfully			1
in @entity3 , there were 121 respondents , with 100 of those aged 22 or under , and with 62 playing in the @entity62			1
every player questioned said they had not played in a game that has since been identified as fixed , nor had they been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match , nor did they believe one or more games have been fixed in that period			0
in @entity3 , the survey concluded players ' betting against the rules was the primary threat to integrity in the game , with nine from 111 players who responded confirming they had bet on matches			2
it added , however , the recent cases of alleged external criminal infiltration ' should act as a reminder that a more serious form of match fixing is a threat that can not be ignored '			0
there have been a number of high - profile police investigations that have come to light			0
arrested : @entity89 's @entity88 was arrested in connection with the match - fixing scandal in december in november 2013 , members of an alleged betting syndicate that included at least three footballers were arrested on suspicion of fixing games in @entity3			1
a month later , police arrested six people in connection with an investigation into spot - fixing in @entity3 football after a former @entity62 defender allegedly told an undercover reporter he had been involved in rigging matches in return for money			1
both cases are currently sub judice			0
in @entity13 , from 103 respondents , there was one player who said he had played in a game that has since been identified as fixed , and one who had been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match , but did not report it			0
of the 84 players who responded to the question as to whether they had bet against the rules on matches , 27 replied ' yes '			0
the survey concluded for @entity13 the focus of future work should be on the ' dangers of gambling and enabling players to keep within the rules ' , with ' peer education ' encouraged as a useful tool			0
investigation : officers from the @entity131 remove documents and equipment from the home of former @entity136 player @entity135 as they looked into allegations of match - fixing last year the results in @entity3 and @entity13 are far removed from a country like @entity15 where match fixing is deemed as being rife			1
from 211 players surveyed in @entity15 , 29 said they had played in a game that has since been identified as fixed ; 27 have been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match , with 139 believing one or more games have been fixed in the past 12 months			0
as part of the ' do n't fix it ' campaign , spearheaded by @entity9 , @entity151 and the compilers of the study , @entity147 in @entity148 , a @entity146 is to be distributed next week to all associations			0
dr @entity155 , of the @entity156 , said : ' this survey was the first large - scale attempt to ascertain the views of current players in regards to match - fixing			1
' the objective was to better understand the issues that lead to match - fixing , in order to use this knowledge to define the prevention and education programme			2
' the over-riding message was that better education designed to prevent match - fixing and gambling is required , with each country to work on initiatives and solutions most relevant to their own specific problems			2

over 1,500 players from eight countries *completed* the questionnaire
results showed players believe match - fixing is not a major scourge
in @entity3 , there were 121 respondents , 62 from the @entity62
