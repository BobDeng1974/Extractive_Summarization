by @entity0 for the @entity1 for more than two years her greatest pleasure in life has been feeding the birds in the garden			1
pensioner @entity7 watches every morning with binoculars from her kitchen window as they tuck in to the seeds and nuts she puts out for them			1
most days the 71 - year - old former driving instructor also enjoys listening to the birdsong that echoes around the communal grounds and sheltered accommodation she shares with other residents			2
heartbroken : @entity7 , 71 , has been banned from feeding the birds in the garden of @entity21 in @entity22 , because the housing association said they were ' health hazards ' but the kind - hearted @entity25 has found herself in a showdown with her neighbours and authorities – after being ordered to stop			1
an investigation involving police , an environmental health specialist and housing trust officials highlighted potential ‘ health hazards ’ and concluded she risked spreading disease			1
she was then called to a housing trust meeting attended by a police officer to discuss the bird feeding and neighbour complaints			2
yesterday miss @entity7 accused officials of ‘ bullying ’ tactics and refused to take down her hanging feeders at @entity21 in @entity43 , @entity44 , which is run by the @entity22 and @entity45			1
she told the @entity1 it was a ‘ harmless pastime ’ that had given her years of enjoyment – and pledged she would stand her ground			1
she added : ‘ i ’ve got about five feeders on the go			0
i take good care of them and spend lots of happy times feeding the birds			2
so i could n’t believe it when i got this letter telling me to stop doing it , and inviting me to a meeting			0
‘ i found out that one of the housing officers even phoned my brother – i think they wanted to find out if i had any mental issues			0
well , i have n’t got any mental issues – i just love birds			0
i feel i ’m being persecuted for doing something that millions of people do every day			0
’ miss @entity7 , a divorcee , conceded there had been long - running hostility after a neighbour objected to and removed two bird tables she had installed			2
since then she has set up hanging feeders in the garden , which she claims hardly anyone else ventures into			0
miss @entity7 accused officials of ' bullying ' tactics claiming that it was ' a harmless past time ' stunned : the pensioner , who lives alone in the retirement flats , received a letter from @entity81 ( @entity81 ) saying she was ' spreading disease ' @entity84 spokesman @entity83 said : ‘ as long as people practise good hygiene with their feeders , there should n’t be a problem			1
it ’s a very positive thing to do			0
’ a spokesman for the housing trust ’s parent company , @entity92 , said police were at the meeting because of ‘ wider issues ’ arising from neighbours ’ allegations and complaints about other matters			0
sanctuary executive @entity101 said in a statement there had been ‘ numerous ’ complaints about the feathers , droppings , dust and seeds in the communal garden			0
‘ we fully appreciate that she enjoys her time feeding birds , but using the communal area to do so is causing a disruption to other residents , which we need to consider			1
’ ' only enjoyment ' : mrs @entity7 has been feeding the birds with her own money			1
she says one of her ' few pleasures ' in life has now been taken away from her			0

@entity7 , 71 , lays out food every day in @entity125 , @entity22
spends her own money feeding the birds at the retirement flats
says it has brought her ' *untold* *amounts* of joy ' for the past four years
but @entity22 *&* @entity45 said she was ' spreading disease '
she now says her ' only enjoyment ' in life has been taken away
