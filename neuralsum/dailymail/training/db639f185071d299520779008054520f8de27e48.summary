a world map redrawn according to each country 's population reduces the size of some countries , keeps many the same , and has a few that show an enormous shift			1
the new cartogram , created by @entity9 , visibly compares all of the world 's countries , with many , including the @entity12 and @entity13 , staying almost exactly the same in terms of size versus their actual land area			1
others however , especially @entity19 , show massive growth , this as a result of their population , now at 1.3billion persons			0
@entity38 's land mass on the map has also increased thanks to its population of 1.4 billion			2
other nations like @entity43 with 859,000 , @entity44 with 328,000 , @entity45 with 631,000 , and @entity46 with 416,000 , have been scaled down to a micro square			1
countries with less than 250,000 - such as @entity48 which has a population of 56,000 - were too small to appear on the cartogram			0
the map is an updated version of the first one released by the same creator 10 years ago			2
the first cartogram which was created by the same @entity58 user teadranks 10 years ago since then , it shows that @entity19 has grown by almost 200 million people while @entity38 has increased by about 60 million			1
@entity33 's population , according to the map , has risen by more than three million since 2005			0
and , once again , the @entity12 and @entity13 seem to be growing at a steady and proportionate rate .			0

a new cartogram created by @entity9 shows each country 's size scaled to its population
countries with large populations like @entity38 and @entity19 *dominate* the map
smaller populations which have big *geographic* areas like @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 appear small
other nations like @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are *barely* visible
@entity9 compared the map to the *original* one made 10 years ago
the @entity12 and @entity13 look almost exactly the same on this map as they do a *typical* world map
