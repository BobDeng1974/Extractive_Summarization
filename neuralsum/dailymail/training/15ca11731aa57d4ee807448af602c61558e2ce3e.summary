by @entity0 last updated at 8:09 am on 22nd august 2011 the indignity of mixed - sex hospital wards may at last be coming to an end after a startling fall in the number of patients put in them			1
health secretary @entity7 said the @entity8 had done a ' fantastic job ' after it was revealed that numbers accommodated on such wards fell by 90 per cent in the space of a few months			2
the news follows years of broken promises by @entity15 and is a dramatic victory for the @entity17 which has consistently fought to bring to an end the @entity20 practice of mixing men and women patients			2
no longer the norm : mixed sex wards are now in the minority backed by patients ' groups , the @entity17 has argued that being forced to share wards with the opposite sex is undignified – and puts women at risk			1
figures show that last december more than 11,000 patients were forced to share wards with the opposite sex , when the monthly collection of mixed - sex accommodation data was first introduced			1
since then the number of reported breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has fallen by 90 per cent			2
just 1,126 in @entity42 were made to sleep on mixed sex wards last month – a record low			1
more than two thirds of hospitals reported zero cases , with the @entity47 becoming the first region to report none at all			0
of the 167 trusts that reported , 115 ( 69 per cent ) had no breaches in july			0
shortly after the @entity52 came to power , mr @entity7 announced tough new measures to stamp out the humiliation endured by thousands of patients having to share wards , toilets and bathrooms with the opposite sex			1
in april he brought in fines of £ 250 for each day a patient had to sleep in a mixed - sex ward , which appears to have galvanised @entity20 managers			1
previously , the levels of fines varied considerably and were inconsistently levied			0
fighting for dignity : how the @entity17 's campaign led the way it is 15 years since @entity71 first called for the abolition of mixed wards – a year before he became prime minister – saying it should not be ' beyond the collective wit of ministers ' to achieve			1
however , despite a pledge to ban them in its 1997 and 2001 election manifestos , and a fining system , @entity15 eventually concluded it would be too expensive to get rid of them all			0
it was agreed that in some cases men and women could share a ward if they were separated using partitioned bays			0
in recent years , a number of female patients have been assaulted by men on such wards			1
when the @entity52 came to power last year , it promised to scrap mixed accommodation in all trusts from acute hospitals to mental health units			2
only intensive care and @entity101 units have exemptions			0
' fantastic job ' : @entity7 , the health secretary , hailed the @entity20 for ' getting to grips ' with the problem mr @entity7 said : ' the @entity20 has done a fantastic job getting to grips with this			0
' he said any future capital investments in @entity20 hospitals – whether brand new developments or refurbishments – should look to ensure a minimum of half their beds in single en - suite rooms			2
he said : ' single - sex accommodation is what people can now expect			1
by introducing greater transparency , this government has driven down breaches by 90 per cent in eight months			0
' the rules do allow wards to be segregated into distinct bays as long as they have separate facilities			2
@entity128 , director of the @entity129 , said ; ' it 's embarrassing that it took the threat of fines to get managers to respect the human rights of individual patients			0
' ideally the number of breaches should be at zero everywhere			0
on occasions mixed - sex accommodation may be necessary , but it should be a rarity not the everyday occurrence it was in the past			1
' the @entity17 has been campaigning for 17 years to scrap mixed - sex wards – the use of which has continued despite a series of @entity15 pledges			1
distressing calls to the @entity129 helpline told of elderly women being forced to share toilets , bathrooms and sleeping areas with men , with only a curtain for privacy and safety			0
@entity158 backed the campaign , highlighting the humiliation felt by older men and women dressed only in hospital gowns having to use unisex toilets			0
in 1996 , as leader of the opposition , @entity71 said abolishing mixed sex wards was ' not just a question of money , but a question of political will '			1
broken promise : @entity71 vowed to get rid of the indignity of mixed - sex wards in 1996 , when he was leader of the @entity15 in @entity173 a year later @entity174 , his health minister , said authorities would be expected to get rid of mixed sex wards within the next two years			1
further promises that they would disappear followed – until health minister @entity177 changed tack in january 2008			0
he said : ' the only way we 're going to have single - sex wards within the @entity20 is to build the whole of the @entity20 into single rooms			1
that is an aspiration that can not be met			0
' but in january 2009 the then health secretary @entity186 admitted @entity15 had ' got it wrong ' and introduced fines for hospitals that breached a commitment to ' virtually eliminate ' mixed wards .			2

record low 1,126 slept on mixed - sex wards last month
15 years since @entity71 called for them to be abolished
