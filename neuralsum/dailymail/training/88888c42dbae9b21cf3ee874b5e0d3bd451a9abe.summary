so attempting to ride completely upside down takes nerves of steel and a great deal of talent			0
luckily , @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , has bravery and skill in equal measure			0
on sunday , in front of a watching crowd at @entity15 , @entity16 , he zoomed around a 15 - foot ( 4.6 meter ) loop - and managed to stay on his board			1
boarding on the ridiculous : @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 begins his ride up the loop topsy - turvey : @entity7 is almost upside down and looking stable incredible : the skater is captured completely upside down wheely impressive : fortunately @entity7 's crash helmet was n't put to the test this is by no means the first time that he has wowed the skating community with his derring - do			1
the 23 - year - old , regarded as one of the best skaters in the world , was videoed in july 2011 flying over 20 concrete stairs and making a perfect landing			1
he does n't have a monopoly on amazing skateboarding stunts , though			0
last year 12 - year - old @entity36 pulled off a stunning 1080 spin ( that 's three full rotations ) in @entity39 in @entity16 and repeated the incredible trick later that year to take gold in an @entity43 competition			1
extreme skater @entity44 , meanwhile , flew 79 feet ( 24 meters ) over the @entity45 in 2005 - at a height of 23 feet ( or seven meters )			2
and in 2011 @entity47 pulled off a trick so complicated that it 's almost impossible to describe			0
his final run in the @entity51 competition featured a ' heelflip body varial frontside 540 ' that left the crowd feeling dizzy .			0
