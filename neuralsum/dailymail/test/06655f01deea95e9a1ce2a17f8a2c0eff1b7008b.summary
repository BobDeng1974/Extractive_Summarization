the importance of saturday 's match against @entity2 for @entity5 ’s @entity4 ambitions can not be overstated			1
the reverse fixture , a 2 - 2 draw in december , prompted @entity5 ’s renaissance into the @entity10 ’s form team			2
thereafter , they went 13 top - flight games without defeat and put themselves in contention to qualify for @entity16 ’s top competition before losing to @entity17 in a drama - filled match two weeks ago			2
@entity20 's acrobatic volley two weeks ago left @entity5 five points adrift of @entity17 in fourth @entity23 ' side need to beat @entity2 on saturday to keep up their chances of a top - four finish @entity5 have been in good form since they last played @entity2 , but are not in the @entity28 spots a defeat could leave @entity5 eight points adrift of the top four with just seven games to play , a massive mountain to climb			1
the statistics suggest victory at the @entity35 is an unlikely scenario			0
in six games against the @entity10 ’s other top - five sides , @entity5 have won just one and picked up four points compared with @entity17 who have won three of five games against their toughest competition			1
in @entity2 they face a side who have cemented their @entity28 spot with four top - flight wins in as many games in march			1
for their efforts , @entity49 was given the @entity52 for a 14th time and striker @entity54 the @entity55			0
@entity5 are likely to face a side riding on a wave of confidence and optimism so it will be a tough ask to get a result			2
with more money on offer than ever before , @entity5 know they need to be at @entity16 's top table @entity64 and @entity65 train ahead of the vital trip to @entity2 on saturday it is not just the pride of fans at stake in this game but also the financial security of the club			1
a @entity75 study this week revealed the race for @entity4 has gained even more importance after @entity16 announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season			2
cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is increasing by up to 50 per cent , and for @entity86 clubs there will also be steep hikes in ' market pool ' money from @entity16 's tv incomes			0
if an @entity86 club were to win next season 's @entity28 , they would earn around £ 75m at today 's exchange rates from central @entity16 funds alone			2
ticket income plus any commercial bonuses would be on top			0
under current prize money arrangements , clubs reaching the group stage receive £ 6.4m each plus £ 750,000 per group win and £ 370,000 per draw			0
the basic fee will rise 40 per cent to £ 8.9m and each win will jump 50 per cent to £ 1.1m			0
prize money for reaching the last 16 , quarter - finals and semi-finals will leap up 57 per cent , respectively to £ 4m , £ 4.44m and £ 5.2m			0
the prize for being tournament runner - up will jump from £ 4.8m to £ 7.8m while the winner 's prize will jump from £ 7.8m to £ 11.11m			0
for a team like @entity5 , who enjoy a big worldwide profile , particularly in @entity116 , money like that could solidify their position among the @entity120 elite for the next decade			1
securing @entity120 football will also be vital to ensure they attract world - class players and keep the ones they already have at the club			1
even with @entity28 qualification @entity5 were unable to hold on to @entity127 last summer @entity64 's contract situation demonstrates how important it is for @entity23 ' side to qualify the contract wrangling with @entity64 in recent weeks will undoubtedly have been a distraction to the player himself and the focus of manager @entity23 but they will have to put that to one side if they are to overcome @entity2			1
on the @entity141 subject , it would be much easier to resolve his future and persuade him to remain in @entity144 come the end of the season if @entity5 have the certainty of @entity28 football to offer as an enticement			1
players want to compete on the biggest stage they can			0
regardless of how much money each week is being offered , the chance to play against the best teams in @entity16 is priceless .			0

@entity28 qualification is more *lucrative* than ever
@entity5 are already five points off the top four with eight game to go
@entity64 *dispute* shows how important @entity120 football is
