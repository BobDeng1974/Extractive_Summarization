a few blocks from the finish line and even closer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 @entity5 , race organizers are building a combination clubhouse , interactive museum and retail store that , for the first time , gives them a year - round , public presence			1
the @entity11 scheduled to open april 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world 's most prestigious road race , run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118 - year history			1
it will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the @entity24 , and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street			0
construction : @entity30 paints the ceiling of @entity11 near the 26 - mile mark of the @entity5 , in @entity33 on wednesday champion : a gold laurel wreath , which is awarded to the winner of the @entity5 , is displayed at the @entity37			1
the wreath , and other historic items from the race , will be on display when @entity11 opens later in april location : @entity11 is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line , and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race			1
runners are seen here during the 2013 @entity5 if they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a @entity5 jacket , they can do that , too			2
' this @entity11 is the front door , ' @entity56 , the executive director of the @entity37 , said this week before checking in on the construction at the @entity60 storefront			1
' it is intended to be a place where the visitor can touch the history , the tradition of the @entity5 , and then get out and do something , go for a run themselves			1
' a combined effort between the @entity37 , @entity69 and longtime shoe - seller @entity70 , which is providing the staff and retail know - how , the @entity11 is a shoeseum of sorts : part shoe store , part museum			1
it is the sixth @entity11 for @entity69 0 the first in the @entity78 but it will differ from locations from @entity80 to @entity81 , as well as the @entity83 store nearby , because of its association with the @entity5			1
' not only is the @entity5 the @entity85 of running , but @entity33 is an amazing running community , ' said @entity87 , @entity69 ' director of running innovation			2
and that became even more apparent after two bombs interrupted the 2013 race , attacks that galvanized runners and turned the @entity5 into a symbol of the city 's resilience			1
' it drew the global running community together over something that 's kind of ours , as runners , ' @entity87 said			0
from something so tragic , it was incredibly powerful what came out of that ... realizing that we had something even more special than we had before			0
' a running club that had long been associated primarily with its flagship race , the @entity37 had spent the last 15 years expanding its calendar to include a half - marathon in the fall and a @entity115 and @entity116 in the spring and summer			1
but the organization remained tucked away a few blocks from the course in offices decorated with memorabilia that can be seen , @entity56 said , by ' essentially nobody			0
' down the street : @entity60 , the site of the 2013 @entity125 - as well as the finish line for the marathon itself - is now how to a @entity5 - themed store and clubhouse legacy : a cyclist pedals over the finish line of the @entity5 on wednesday			1
year - round visitors to @entity33 have had limited options to learn the history of the race , besides visiting the course , until this month when @entity11 opens leader : @entity56 , the executive director of the @entity37 , smiles during an interview regarding @entity11 ' we thought : why not take all this stuff and bring it out to the street ? ' he said			1
' if you can be engaged with the community , you have a chance			0
you may still screw things up , but you have a chance			0
otherwise , you 're just the guys who are stopping traffic			0
' the @entity37 plans to use the @entity11 for special events , including clinics and meet - ups where recreational joggers can connect or get tips from coaches before heading out on a run			1
lockers and showers will save them a trip home to change ; those staying at one of the @entity165 's dozens of hotels might be sent by the front desk to find a running partner or a good route for , say , a leisurely @entity115			0
the site is about one block after marathon runners turn off of @entity173 for the final stretch to the finish line , not far from the @entity176 that is one of the city 's prettiest backdrops for a run			1
it is across the street from the @entity183 , which hosts a shoulder - to - shoulder runners ' expo on marathon weekend and events throughout the year			2
' for me , it does n't matter if it 's a dental convention or a running convention , ' @entity87 said			0
' right outside on @entity60 , when they walk outside , they 're going to see that @entity11			2
' much of the memorabilia had been on display in the @entity37 offices			2
other items , like the sweatshirt @entity198 wore when she became the first woman to enter the race — and when a race official tried to bodily remove her from the course — were locked away in drawers			0
now they will be included in rotating exhibits , along with records of every @entity5 competitor in one place for the first time			2
' you could go in there and say , " hey , my dad ran this in 1972			0
" and click , click , click , you could look up your dad , ' @entity87 said			0
said @entity37 spokesman @entity216 : ' this will be our @entity218			2
' ' when someone participates in the @entity5 , they feel like they are added to the honor roll			0
it 's almost like being a part of an alumni association : you just have that connection with the people that have preceded you , ' he said			0
' and you know that you are following , literally , in their footsteps			0
