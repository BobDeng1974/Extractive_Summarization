@entity4 and @entity9 were last seen on friday , riding their bicycles in downtown @entity12 , @entity13			1
when they never returned home , hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls , and their bikes were found next to @entity18			1
teams have been dragging the lake for the past several days but have found nothing			1
local authorities are cooperating with the @entity32 and it appears the mounting pressure and unimaginable loss has taken its toll on the family			1
' you tell them the truth and they say , " you 're holding something back , " and you 're not			2
what is left to talk about ? you know , we go over and over and over again , ' he told @entity46			0
' it made me feel like , " yeah , they 're looking at me like a suspect			0
" ' @entity52 's wife , @entity51 , told @entity53 that the family has been completely accessible to law enforcement and want to do everything in their power to help the investigation			2
' we 've done extensive interviews , hours at a time , we 've done polygraphs , we have taken many phone calls , answered many questions , ' she said			0
' we 've given our phones up , all of our data has been , you know , taken off of our phones			0
in fact , my sister [ 's ] and my phone is now not , our touch screens are n't working very well			0
so we 've cooperated to the fullest			0
' a spokesman from @entity75 said it would take another several days at least for the lake to be fully drained and that the family has complied diligently to all requests made of them			2
@entity32 spokeswoman @entity80 said the reaction from the dogs on monday night indicated a ' strong possibility ' the girls had been at the lake , less than a mile from their grandmother 's house where they were last seen on friday			1
however , @entity80 said because there were no confirmed sightings at the lake , authorities could not be certain			0
close : the girls , pictured in 2009 , often spent the day together when @entity9 's mother was at work ' i 'm worried that so many days have gone by [ and ] we have n't found anything and no evidence has come up , ' @entity51 said			1
' the more time that passes , the greater chances that they are not alive or the further away that they might be getting			0
' chief deputy @entity101 of the @entity75 said the case was still considered a missing persons investigation			0
the decision to drain the lake was made to rule out the possibility the girls were in the water , he said			2
@entity80 said the search has been slowed because of the time required to drain the lake			2
the draining began monday afternoon and could take up to three days			2
a father 's agony : @entity2 leans on a tree near @entity18 where his daughter @entity9 and her cousin @entity4 disappeared the lake is draining through a 3 - foot culvert with a grate over it that would prevent a body from flowing into it , @entity101 said			1
a pump was brought in on tuesday to quicken the pace			0
collecting evidence : law enforcement officials and search volunteers have focused on @entity18 in search of the girls a group of three officers walking along the southeast shoreline stopped to study something that appeared to be a cup			1
an officer with gloves and an evidence bag picked it up and took it back to a patrol car sitting along the bank			0
officials did n't identify the object or even confirm whether it was related to the search for the girls but it was a rare sign of activity in a massive search that has produced few if any significant leads			1
@entity2 , @entity9 's father , told the @entity150 : ' i do n't think that they 're in the lake , not at all but it is just like a dead end as far as we know so far			0
' he added : ' we 've never gone through anything like this			0
it 's hard enough just to get up and deal with the reality that your daughter is gone			0
' family members were still hopeful that the girls would be found safe , despite investigators admitting that had no new clues as to their whereabouts			1
chief deputy @entity101 said authorities were interviewing family and friends of the girls in hopes that they might shed some light on the girls ' behaviour and state of mind before their disappearance			1
@entity180 , 48 , an aunt to both of the girls , said all the signs were pointing to a stranger - possibility a pedophile - who may have abducted them from the area where the bikes were found			1
@entity180 said that just last week she taught @entity9 how to ' save someone if they went limp in the water			0
' she said she also taught both girls how to ' drop to the ground and fight ' if someone tried to abduct them			2
mom and dad : @entity9 's parents @entity199 and @entity2 say they do n't suspect a drowning , noting the girls ' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake @entity9 's parents said they did n't suspect a drowning either , noting the girls ' swimming abilities and the fact that no shoes were recovered on the bank of the lake			2
@entity2 said : ' the area where the bikes were found is fenced on both sides , and it is right where [ a ] maintenance gate is			2
it is a spot that looks to me like a trap			0
' somebody could have just come along right then or followed them down it would have been the worst spot to be in right there			0
' search : more than 350 volunteers came saturday to help search @entity226 for the two missing girls local support : volunteer @entity229 searches debris around @entity18			1
but , despite a large turn - out of volunteers , police say they have not found any evidence that would point them to the girls ' whereabouts registered sex offenders in the are are also being interviewed			1
the mothers of both girls said they were trying to stay strong as the search dragged on			1

' search : this poster was issued to complement rescue efforts by around 400 officials and volunteers the girls were being looked after by their grandmother @entity255 on friday when they decided to take a cycle ride to the nearby lake			1
