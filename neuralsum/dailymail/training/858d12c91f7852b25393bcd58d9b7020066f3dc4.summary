@entity1 ran a ' @entity3 ' bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 which encouraged would - be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour , former sports minister sir @entity0 has said			1
the world governing body is firmly under the spotlight again following the release of a report on thursday by the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of @entity1 's ethics committee which cleared @entity15 and @entity16 to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments having found no serious breaches of bidding rules by either nation			1
however , the man who led the investigation on which that report was based , @entity22 lawyer @entity21 , immediately appealed against the findings of the published report , saying it contained ' numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions ' detailed in his own report - which has not been made public			2
the bidding process that led to @entity16 being awarded the 2018 @entity34 has been likened to the ' @entity3 ' investigator @entity21 ( @entity35 ) and @entity1 ethics committee chairman @entity36 - pictured together in 2012 - have different interpretations of the report into the bidding process while @entity15 and @entity16 were effectively cleared in the report published by @entity43 judge @entity36 , the @entity41 2018 bid team was criticised for a number of rule violations , particularly in how it sought to secure the votes controlled by former @entity1 vice-president @entity47			1
the @entity48 has reported that @entity50 national @entity49 sought to strike a vote - sharing deal with an @entity41 bid official			0
@entity49 was banned from all football activity for life in 2011 after being found guilty of bribery during his campaign to oust @entity57 as @entity1 president , but the @entity16 bid team has always insisted that he never had any official role in its organisation			2
@entity16 2022 and the joint @entity64 - @entity63 2018 bid teams have always strenuously denied collusion over the sharing of votes , and no evidence of this was presented in @entity36 's report			1
@entity0 , who was appointed as @entity71 in the months leading up to the decision to award the @entity34 to @entity15 and @entity16 in december 2010 , said it very quickly became clear to him that the process was flawed			2
world football governing body @entity1 have cleared both @entity16 and @entity15 of any rule breaches @entity1 president @entity57 hands over the @entity34 trophy to @entity16 's @entity77 he told @entity80 's @entity79 programme : ' the problem here is that the @entity1 rules were not at all clear			1
i asked the question when i became sports minister about what we were and were not allowed to do , and one of ( the @entity41 2018 bid team ) said , and i quote exactly : ' there are no rules , it is a @entity3 of a bidding process			1
'' @entity0 claimed the violations by @entity41 2018 detailed by @entity36 - which included helping to secure employment for an associate of @entity47 and covering the costs of a Â£ 35,000 gala dinner for @entity102 officials - were ' minor infractions ' compared to other things he believes were going on			0
' being @entity105 we 've been quite honest about what we did and i suspect quite a lot of other bidding nations have n't been honest , ' he added			0
' you come back to the central point in all this - the 2018 bid team did not think they had done anything wrong			0
@entity116 who was leading the bid is a man of enormous integrity and honesty			0
' former sports minister sir @entity0 says he was told there were ' no rules ' to the bidding process @entity0 backed calls for @entity21 's report to be published in full , adding : ' ( publishing the report ) is the only possible way that @entity1 can start to regain its reputation			1
it has no reputation at all - the words ' @entity1 ' and ' corruption ' are inextricably linked			0
' the only way they could start to repair their reputation would be to publish that report in full , to shine a light into dark places			0
' but i think the chances of that happening are fairly limited , unless @entity21 decides the damage to his professional reputation is so great that he redacts those bits where he 's made commitments to people and then releases it unilaterally , i think that 's probably our best hope			0

@entity1 have been investigated for the bidding process that led to @entity16 and @entity15 hosting the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 respectively
@entity1 report claims there were no breaches of rules by either country but investigator @entity21 says findings have n't been presented properly
former sports minister sir @entity158 claims there were ' no rules ' into the bidding process that was run like the ' @entity3 '
