on a bright evening in @entity2 ’s capital city , this was a game of notable firsts for @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s competitive debut as manager ended in a narrow first leg victory over @entity9			1
the @entity11 ’s side will surely advance to the third qualifying round of the @entity13 after @entity14 ended his first start for the @entity17 first team with the winning goal seven minutes from time			1
in an @entity2 summer , even the night - time feels luminous			2
@entity6 could see clearly , then , that some hard work lies ahead			2
match winner : @entity14 celebrates netting his debut goal in the 84th minute fortunate : the youngster 's shot deflected past the goalkeeper at his near post @entity4 : @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 ; @entity34 ( @entity35 73 ) , @entity36 , @entity14 ; @entity37 ( @entity38 73 )			1
subs : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44			2
@entity9 : @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 58 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 80 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			2
subs : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity57 , @entity61 , @entity62			2
in the modest , underwhelming , junior park surroundings of the 1,700 capacity @entity66 , the @entity64 champions showed wastefulness before goal			1
they were slow to warm to their task			2
they did find some urgency in the second half and began to pepper the goal of the @entity2 champions — but the game really ought to have been safe long before young @entity14 justified his inclusion after an impressive season on loan at @entity82 by claiming a deflected late winner			1
the @entity17 side struck the crossbar twice through @entity36 and @entity34			2
the former @entity87 and @entity88 men had started the night on the right of an attacking midfield , with @entity14 on the left			1
they occasionally resembled square pegs in round holes			1
essentially a central midfielder , however , @entity14 had switched to the right flank when he cut inside in 83 minutes , beat two men and struck a low , deflected shot inside the left - hand post of the stranded home keeper @entity45			1
the goal marked a memorable night for a 21 - year - old who scored 14 goals in 35 starts in @entity105 ’s @entity104 last season			1
he went some way here to taking an opportunity presented as much by a lack of options as anything else			2
@entity35 could have scored as a late substitute here , but was n’t trusted enough to start			0
this is a squad which , on the evidence of this first - leg , second - round qualifying tie , needs help			1
and it needs it quickly if they are to reach the promised land of the @entity13 group stage for a third successive season			0
@entity6 gave an inkling of how he wants to play with a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation featuring @entity32 and @entity33 as deep lying midfielders			0
it ’s debatable if @entity4 really needed that level of insurance against a team of @entity2 part - timers			1
it left an isolated @entity37 playing up front with @entity36 , @entity34 and @entity14 behind			1
the formation mirrored @entity139 ’s @entity138 with one key difference			0
@entity139 has the players to do it			0
right now , @entity6 does n’t scenes : the @entity4 players celebrate in front of the jubilant travelling support in @entity2 scrap : @entity4 's @entity148 battles for possession with @entity52 nevertheless , the reign almost got off to the kind of sublime start which would have rendered @entity14 ’s late counter academic			1
commons , the player of the year and the scorer of 32 goals last season , started as if he meant business			0
as if he planned simply to take up where he left off before			0
in the ninth minute , he ended some neat work by @entity34 by thumping a looping 25 - yard left - foot volley on to the top of the crossbar			2
he was at it again two minutes later , smashing another long - range effort towards the top corner with his left foot			0
@entity169 pushed it round the post , but he looked none too convincing			2
after 10 minutes , this looked a walk in the park for @entity4			1
a public park , indeed			0
maybe they even began to think that themselves			0
because for all the possession and dominance of the first half , there was a predictability and pedestrian aspect to @entity4 ’s play in the opening half			1
in their black and white vertical shirts , @entity9 were no @entity188			0
@entity48 , brother - in - law of @entity190 superstar @entity189 , offered a slither of intrigue			0
but , like his team - mates , he offered precious little else			0
@entity195 striker @entity50 smashed a low right - foot shot from 25 yards , which was gathered low by @entity27			0
yet @entity4 ’s keeper saw as much action here as he did in @entity200 when he was an unused squad member in @entity105 ’s @entity202 squad			1
shot at glory : @entity36 unleashes a fierce effort at goal the mild concern for @entity4 was this			1
@entity45 , at the other end , was hardly run off his feet until the latter stages of the game , either			0
commons , the one true player of invention and craft @entity4 have , was locked in a personal war of attrition with the @entity9 keeper , beginning a second period of more tempo and urgency much as he did the first			1
within minutes of the restart , the former @entity138 international had three decent chances to score			0
he could easily have had another of the hat - tricks which pockmarked last season ’s remarkable campaign			0
the first two were rising right - foot shots which soared over the bar from just inside the area			0
perhaps his best chance of all came in 54 minutes			0
a neat one - two with @entity37 ended in the @entity232 advancing on the left side of the box and squaring a low ball for the former @entity237 player to sidefoot towards goal			2
the effort lacked pace and conviction and allowed @entity45 to fall low to his left to clutch gratefully			0
but @entity4 were coming closer			1
not what they 're used to : @entity4 's team line up in front of a modest attendance in @entity9 they struck the crossbar for the second time of the match when @entity34 was deeply unfortunate to see his ferocious left - foot strike , after cutting in from the side , rebound off the face of the upright			1
it was still shaking when the @entity138 striker made way for @entity257 in 73 minutes , @entity38 replacing @entity37			0
the substitutes should have conjured the long - awaited opening goal within minutes of their arrival			2
@entity35 brought out a close - range double save from @entity45 before the ball broke kindly for @entity38			0
the @entity264 really ought to have buried the rebound but dragged the ball too wide with a poor touch and fired his angled shot against the outside of the post			0
it was an embarrassing miss which threatened to tee up a mildly embarrassing scoreless draw			0
for @entity4 , it looked one of those nights			1
@entity14 ’s debut to remember changed all that .			1

@entity14 scores winner in the 84th minute
goal gives @entity4 advantage in @entity285 second round qualifier
