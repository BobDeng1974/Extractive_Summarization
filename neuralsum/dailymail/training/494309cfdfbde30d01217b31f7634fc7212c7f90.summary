' the mother - of - one ’s ordeal began last july when she started to suffer crippling stomach pains and huge swelling to her abdomen			1
her condition became so serious she struggled to fit behind the steering wheel of her car , as her stomach bloated			0
doctors initially put miss @entity2 's condition down to a gastric bug , hernia or gall stones			1
but tests and scans revealed she had a 20cm sertoli - leydig cell tumour growing on one of her ovaries			0
the medical team caring for her , told the mother - of - one she would have to undergo a three - hour operation to remove the cancer , followed by nine weeks of intense chemotherapy			1

each year , around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the @entity74 , and it is estimated that less than 0.5 per cent of these are @entity57 ( @entity91 )			1
the cancer is a rare ovarian tumour that belongs to the group of sex - cord stromal tumours			2

but fortunately the drastic step was not necessary , but miss @entity2 was still advised her chances of conceiving another child were significantly reduced			2
she said : ' at the time the thought of having a hysterectomy did not bother me as i was so focused on being ill that i did n’t care , but i would be devastated now if i had needed a hysterectomy			0
' with having only one ovary it was expected that it would be difficult for me to have any more children and chemotherapy also affects the menstrual cycle so my chances of having another child were low			0
' i ’m so excited and happy to be pregnant and getting married			2
i ’m looking to the future and everything i have ever wanted i have got now			0
' miss @entity2 is regularly monitored by experts to check that the cancer has not returned			2
