the @entity0 and the @entity1 boasted wednesday that 3.3 million @entity2 have signed up for private insurance coverage through marketplaces set up by the @entity5			1
but the administration still has n't said a word about how many – or how few – of those signing up on the chronically ill healthcare.gov website have paid for their insurance , and are actually covered			2
a @entity12 analysis of publicly available totals from five states that run their own health insurance exchanges found that on average , just 66.5 per cent of enrollees in those states have paid premiums			0
if that proportion holds nationwide , the total number of @entity2 who are actually covered by private insurance because of @entity5 is less than 2.2 million			1
bucking up the troops ? president @entity24 has delivered speeches to groups of @entity5 enrollment advocates , but they have n't come through enough to breed widespread optimism about the @entity5 political land mine : chairman of the @entity31 @entity30 caught reporters ' spears last week after a @entity35 report found that millions of jobs would be lost because of the president 's health care law at least five states provide such statistics on their own enrollees , showing that the numbers are , or ought to be , generally obtainable			1
a quarterly report published wednesday by @entity43 announced that ' to date , 3.3 million persons have selected a marketplace plan during the first four months of the initial open enrollment period , including 1.4 million in @entity47 [ state - based marketplaces ] and 1.9 million in the @entity49 [ federally facilitated marketplace ]			1
' but @entity43 conceded that its numbers ' include those who have paid a premium and those who have not yet paid a premium , regardless of when their coverage begins			2
' ' enrollment is measured as those who selected a plan , ' an @entity43 press release confirms			2
similar disclaimers are offered some 20 times in the @entity43 report , both in its text and in accompanying graphs			0
the @entity0 did not respond to a request for comment			2
@entity69 spokesman @entity70 told @entity12 that his agency has n't ' prioritized ' reporting payment statistics , but plans to ' once our automated payment systems are completed and fully tested			1
' at least five states , though , have already figured out how to do it			0
press releases from health insurance exchanges in the states @entity12 sampled , including populous @entity80 and @entity81 , show that 966,312 @entity2 have selected @entity5 plans there			1
of those , 642,979 have paid for at least one month of insurance coverage			0
the state - by - state number are all over the map			0
eighty - five per cent of @entity88 's enrollees have paid first - month 's premiums			0
that percentage was about 75 in @entity81 , 66 in @entity91 , 59 in @entity80 and a dismal 51.5 per cent in the state of @entity93			1
no longer to blame : @entity5 's disastrous early months were blamed on a deeply flawed website , but failure at the march 31 finish line will fall squarely on the @entity0 spin cycle : @entity0 press secretary @entity98 took a break tuesday night from defending @entity5 , escorting his wife , @entity101 reporter @entity100 , to the @entity102 in honor of @entity105 president @entity104 the @entity24 administration said 25 per cent of the national enrollment total are @entity2 between the ages of 18 and 34 , a far cry from the roughly 40 per cent economics say must enroll in order to avoid a ' death spiral ' for @entity5			1
the program 's economics depend heavily on the presumption that a flood of younger , healthier people will contribute premium dollars in order to offset the cost of medical care for the old and sick			0
but with minimal fines – starting at just $ 95 this year – and widespread recognition that the @entity125 can only collect the penalty from @entity2 who are due an income tax refund , many young people are opting out			0
and early technical glitches and wholesale disasters plagued healthcare.gov as well as some of the state - based exchanges			0
@entity133 's , for instance , is still not functional after a nearly five - month delay			0
consumers have until feb. 15 to select a plan if they want to be covered by march 1			2
but @entity43 quietly announced this week that on saturday , the deadline day , a @entity138 computer system used to screen applicants for eligibility will be offline for long - planned annual maintenance .			1

@entity0 wo n't comment on payment statistics for @entity5 plans , relying on numbers of ' selected plans ' as a proxy
@entity69 says its automated payment systems are not yet ' completed and fully tested '
*combined* numbers from five states that publish those stats , including @entity81 and @entity80 , indicate a 66 per cent payment rate
if that percentage holds true nationwide , less than 2.2 million @entity2 are actually insured through @entity5 - created policies
deadline is saturday for @entity2 who want coverage by march 1 , but @entity43 warns about ill - timed tech outages on the deadline day
