growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day , vets have warned but with people living busier lives than ever before , many pet owners are turning to drugs to quell the problems			1
experts are worried people are feeding dogs and cats their own supplies of human antidepressants , or getting a prescription from their vet for animal - specific medication			1
