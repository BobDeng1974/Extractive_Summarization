the @entity9 mayor , who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known @entity3 in the country , will make a high - profile joint appearance with @entity14 , sources said			1
there have been growing calls from conservative mps for mr @entity0 to be ‘ weaponised ’ as the party seeks to break away from @entity6			1
high profile : @entity0 ( pictured at a gin distillery in @entity9 on friday ) will move centre stage in the @entity3 election campaign next week while many polls indicate deadlock , one by @entity23 for the @entity24 lifted @entity3 spirits yesterday by putting their party up four points in a week and moving ahead of @entity6			1
the conservatives were on 34 per cent , with @entity6 down two on 33 per cent			0
it is only the second time the @entity3 have been ahead with @entity23 since the organisation began conducting national polling in 2011			1
the poll put @entity33 on 17 per cent , the @entity34 on seven per cent and the @entity35 on three			0
last night @entity36 , the advertising guru who masterminded @entity38 ’s three election victories , was scathing about the @entity40 ’ campaign , saying : ‘ it ’s dreadful			1
there is no engagement with real voters			0
‘ @entity14 seems to be content with the idea that there will be a hung @entity51			2
they do n’t even seem to be fighting for an overall majority			0
the campaign seemed to be based on the idea that @entity55 could n’t even tie his own shoelaces properly			2
when he showed he can there was no @entity58 ’ there have been growing calls from conservative mps for mr @entity0 to be ‘ weaponised ’ as the party seeks to break away from @entity6 there was surprise that mr @entity0 was not present at this week ’s @entity3 manifesto launch , with mr @entity14 instead introduced by education secretary @entity66 , home secretary @entity67 and chancellor @entity68			1
@entity70 polling suggests mr @entity0 is by far the most popular senior @entity3 among @entity33 voters , who mr @entity14 has pleaded with to ‘ come home ’ to his party rather than risk a @entity6 government propped up by the @entity75			1
other senior figures told the @entity77 that @entity14 must underline manifesto pledges aimed at working class voters – such as extending the right - to - buy and promising a tax - free minimum wage			1
‘ the tax - free minimum wage is the best policy we ’ve had in years – but we have n’t heard a word about it since the manifesto , ’ said one former minister			2
@entity0 tried a 99 cornet ( left ) in @entity88 yesterday and visited the @entity89 ( right ) ‘ we should be out selling some of the terrific stuff in the manifesto every day until polling day			1
it ’s not enough to make one good speech			2
‘ we need to get everybody out there – all the @entity96 – pushing these arguments day after day			0
’ one senior @entity3 donor said the campaign was ‘ lacklustre ’ , ‘ negative ’ , and ‘ boring ’			1
‘ i am afraid we are paying a terrible price for not having a proper narrative over the last five years			0
people just do n’t know what we stand for any more			0
‘ why are we talking only now about extending right to buy ? why is there nothing on immigration ? where is the @entity96 ? ‘ why are n’t we using @entity0 who is our biggest hitter and actually knows how to win elections ? ’ the donor added : ‘ there is no sense of urgency			2
we seem to be sleepwalking to defeat praying that the polls might turn in the last week like it did in 1992			0
‘ if it was n’t for the @entity75 surge in @entity118 @entity55 would be in @entity119 with a comfortable majority			0
we could n’t beat @entity121 and now it seems we ca n’t beat @entity55 who was supposed to be an even worse leader			0
‘ with the economy performing so well we should be miles ahead instead we are in danger of boring voters to death			0
’ the @entity9 mayor , who has been largely invisible at a national level despite being the second best known @entity3 in the country , will make a high - profile joint appearance with @entity14 , sources said some @entity40 are also complaining that the collapse in party membership has decimated their ground operation in some constituencies and they are being outleafleted by @entity6 – whose canvas operation has been swelled by thousand of trade unionists – by three to one			1
another said the mood was ‘ tense ’ and there was ‘ some dismay ’ that the manifesto launch had not given the party ‘ lift - off ’			1
‘ the polls have moved a bit in our favour			0
but if we are to turn the tide decisively , we need to keep the energy up and we should be using @entity0 more			2
’ one candidate hoping to be re-elected in a marginal seat said : ‘ @entity0 is doing good stuff on the ground but we should be seeing more of him – he ’s box office			2
unlike some of our secretaries of state , people actually want to turn out to hear him			0
’ a @entity3 adviser said : ‘ we ’ve always known this would be an incredibly close election and that a large number of undecided voters will only decide who they want in @entity119 – @entity14 or @entity55 – at the last minute			1
‘ you will be seeing more of @entity0 as we move towards the end of the campaign – that has always been the plan			1
’ the latest polls suggest a swing back to the @entity40 , but nothing close to the lead they would need for a @entity178 majority			0
a @entity180 poll suggested the @entity40 had cut a six - point @entity6 lead to one , while @entity182 put the party two points ahead , with 34 per cent to @entity6 ’s 32			0
a @entity186 poll , meanwhile , had the two main parties tied on 34 per cent .			0
