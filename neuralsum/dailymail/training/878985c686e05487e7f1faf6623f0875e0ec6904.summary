@entity1 's oldest living woman recently tried to open a @entity3 account to connect with family and friends , but thanks to her advanced years she had to lie about her age to do it			1
@entity8 , who recently celebrated her 114th birthday , is simply too old for @entity3 's account creation page			1
the undaunted @entity12 woman simply knocked a few years off her age and created her account as a 99 - year - old			1
forever 99 : seen here celebrating her 114th birthday at a party with family and friends held at her @entity1 retirement community this past sunday , @entity16 had to lie while creating a @entity3 account because it does n't allow users to be any older than 99 silver surfer : @entity16 's love of technology may have come late in life but she 's now an avid @entity27 user @entity8 's interest in technology came a little late in life , but that has n't stopped her from adopting as much of it as she can			1
not only does she have @entity3 now , but the woman who holds the honor of being @entity36 's seventh oldest living person is also a frequent @entity27 user on her @entity37			2
@entity8 first became interested in @entity3 thanks to her friend @entity38 , a @entity39 sales rep who once sold @entity8 's 85 - year - old son @entity41 a phone for her , according to @entity42			1
' i just sold him the @entity44 and he was talking about his mother and i realized @entity41 was 85 years young and i was just astounded , ' @entity38 said			0
he was even more shocked when he learned @entity41 's mother 's age			0
still has a sense of humor : @entity16 has always had a curious nature , according to her 85 - year - old son but she turned to old tech to write a letter to @entity3 and @entity54			2
' i 'm still here ' is all it read the two became fast friends and now @entity38 is a sort of technology guide for ever - curious @entity8			0
' she 's become something of a kindred spirit , ' @entity38 told @entity42			0
@entity38 has taught his friend to email and use @entity64 and now he 's helping @entity66 petition @entity3 to get her real age on her account			1
she dictated a message for him type out on a typewriter and mail to @entity3 's @entity54			2
' i 'm still here , ' it read			0
@entity8 is awaiting a response			0
in the mean time , she celebrates her 114th birthday on october 15			2
friends and family held a birthday party on sunday at her @entity12 retirement community .			0

the *website* account creation page *refused* to accept @entity8 's birth year of 1900
the undaunted *centenarian* loves trying new things and had to knock over a *decade* off her age to become 99 and @entity3 friendly
