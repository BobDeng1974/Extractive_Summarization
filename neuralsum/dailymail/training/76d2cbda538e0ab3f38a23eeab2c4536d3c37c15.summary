@entity1 ’s warring ethics chiefs effectively passed the buck over @entity3 bid corruption onto another @entity6 official on thursday to complicate the long - running controversy yet further			2
@entity8 and @entity9 met at @entity1 ’s @entity6 headquarters on thursday to sort out their differences			1
this followed the unprecedented situation of investigator @entity8 disowning the summary of his report made by judge @entity9 that cleared @entity17 and @entity18 to stage the next two @entity19 and apportioned most blame for violating bid integrity on the @entity23 2018 campaign			1
the only common ground that the pair could find was that @entity27 financier @entity26 , chairman of @entity1 ’s audit and compliance committee should receive full copies of all reports before determining how much of that information should be made available to the @entity33			0
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) met on thursday to sort out their differences chairman of the ethics committee @entity8 disowned the summary of his report into @entity3 corruption judge @entity9 's summary cleared @entity17 and @entity18 of any wrongdoing during the @entity3 bidding process @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , @entity17 deputy prime minster @entity42 ( r ) , and @entity1 president @entity43 ( c ) present the @entity3 trophy during @entity47 and 2022 @entity3 bid announcement yet taking the report verdict back into the @entity1 house rather destroys the point of having set up supposedly independent investigatory and adjudicatory chambers in the first place although @entity54 is not a full time @entity1 employee			1
there was no clarity on whether @entity58 attorney @entity8 was still taking his misrepresentation case at @entity9 ’s judgement summary to the @entity1 appeals committee			0
@entity8 has opened up a number of formal cases against individuals as a result of his inquiry which will remain ongoing			0
@entity67 urges @entity1 to publish report			0

@entity8 and @entity9 met in @entity6 on thursday
