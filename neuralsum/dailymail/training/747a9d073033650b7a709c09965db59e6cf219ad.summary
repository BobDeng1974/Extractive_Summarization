@entity0 is undoubtedly one of @entity2 's queens of style reinvention			1
since she first shot to fame in 1982 as a mathematical genius on the @entity8 show countdown aged 22 , the star has had more hairstyles than @entity10 and every member of @entity12 combined			2
this week , she made her biggest leap to date though - turning her natural brunette locks blonde for the first time			1
since starting on @entity19 in 1982 ( right ) , she has had 22 different hair styles but 2015 is the first time she has ever gone blonde ( pictured left yesterday ) while most women might have looked a little unsure at being papped after such a drastic transformation , @entity24 , 54 , smiled confidently into the lens of the camera			1

from dodgy perms to dowdy unlayered long hair with a blunt fringe , @entity24 's early years as a celebrity were almost reliably frumpy			1
but in the late nineties , she started to find her follicule footing and edged into fashionable territory , first with her take on ' the @entity39 , ' then with a mumsy version of @entity42 's styled crop			2
a lesson in toned highlights and layering beckoned a wave of longer cuts that framed her face properly and by 2010 , @entity24 was becoming known for her glossy mane in a positive light			0
but after ticking off most of the styles in the magazines at the hair salon , it was n't going to be long before she took the plunge and reached for the bleach , which has resulted in total success			1
in celebration , @entity29 has taken a look back at the hair journey that took @entity24 from hair hell to heaven : 1964 : @entity24 aged 4 - years - old 1982 : @entity24 's first appearance on @entity19 in 1982 1986 : by 1986 , @entity24 was appearing on countdown three times a week 1987 : 1987 - @entity24 changed back to her maiden name after getting divorced from @entity66 , a @entity67 officer			1
