scientists have been puzzling for years over why some people survive @entity2 while many others perish			1
a new study provides strong evidence that individual genetic differences play a major role in whether people die from the disease			1
they say the discovery could help create a vaccine			1
mice used in the study were generated from eight different strains of the animal and were bred to represent human genetic diversity			1
symptoms in these genetically diverse mice ranged from mild weight loss to full , hemorrhagic fever , including internal bleeding , swollen spleens and changes in liver color and texture			1
' we infected these mice with a mouse - adopted strain of ebola virus , ' said @entity39 , a microbiologist at the @entity40 who helped lead the study			2
' in classical lab mice , this strain of @entity2 kills the animals but it does n't produce hemorrhagic disease , ' she said			1
researchers at the @entity40 in @entity46 reported their findings on thursday in the journal @entity49			0
they compared conventional lab mice , which typically just die when infected with a mouse version of @entity2 , with genetically diverse lab mice that developed a wide range of symptoms in much the same way that people infected with the virus do			1

researchers think the findings may help answer some questions about the @entity2 outbreak in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity76 , which has killed about 5,000 people			2
a major question has been whether @entity2 survivors have had some prior viral exposure that enables their immune systems to fight the infection or whether there is something genetically unique about survivors that makes them resistant			2
the mouse study can not address the issue of prior immunity but makes a strong case for the idea that an individual 's genetic code plays a role in surviving @entity2			1
' there is definitely a genetic component , ' @entity39 said			0
the study shows that host genes influence which cells become infected the study shows that host genes influence which cells become infected and how much the virus replicates , said professor @entity103 , a virologist at the @entity104 , who was not part of the study			0
' most of these genes are involved in the very earliest stages of our immune response to infection , ' something that has also been seen with other viruses , he said in a statement			0
study co-author @entity116 of the @entity40 said he hopes the study will quell some of the debate over the role of genetics in disease progression			0
' these mice were infected with exactly the same dose by exactly the same route by the same investigator			0
' the only thing that was different was the genetic background , ' he said			0
one thing that has hindered @entity2 research has been the lack of a mouse model to study the disease			2
@entity39 hopes her work now makes it easier for scientists to study drugs and vaccines that fight @entity2			2
most such studies are done in monkeys , but they can be hard to work with			0
genetically altered mice are easier to control , especially in the strict confines of a highly secure biocontainment laboratory where such work must be done			0
@entity39 does n't expect mice to replace monkeys , but they may be useful for earlier - stage work .			0
