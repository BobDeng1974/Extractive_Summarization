this dilapidated old shed in @entity10 has been snapped up for £ 550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer the shed has become the nation 's most expensive lockup after selling for three times the average value of a @entity2 home the ramshackle unit is tucked behind a row of terraced houses and does n’t even have access for a car			1
