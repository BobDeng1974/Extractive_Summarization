a @entity1 artist has reinvented the traditional pointe shoe in order to capture a ballerina 's movements and turn them into unique works of art. using new technology , developed in collaboration with @entity11 , @entity8 was able to turn a pair of ballet shoes into a digital paintbrush by fitting them with a device that allows her to track the dancer 's every pli√© , point and arabesque			1
' graphs created with motion may be the same or different depending on the type of movements executed and the correction of the steps and body position			2
' the concept of @entity64 is based on capturing dance movements and transforming them into visual sensations through the use of new technologies			0
' to do this we focused on the ballet shoes themselves , which through the contact with the ground , and thanks to @entity77 technology , record the pressure and movement of the dancer 's feet and send a signal to an electronic device			1
' although the artist has thus far only experimented with the movements of a ballerina , she is confident that the technology can be used with any any form of expressive motion			1
' this is a project that can be extrapolated to other dance disciplines and the applications are multiple , from self - learning or dance classes to the graphical representation of live performance , ' she explains on her website			0
grace and beauty : @entity49 admits that she has always been ' captivated ' by dance tactile sensations : the artist hopes that anyone who buys one of her pieces will be able to feel the dancer 's movement for themselves ' dance is an art that disappears ' : the project allows dancers to keep a long - lasting memory of their movement it is not the first time that @entity49 , who confesses that she has always been ' captivated ' by dance , has used ballet as a means of creating art. last year , the artist worked on a similar project , entitled ' traces , memories of dance ' , which mapped the movements of a group of ballet dancers using a number of different mediums including ink and salt			1
' dance is an art that disappears at the same time that is created , is an ephemeral art which only retain the memory , ' she said at the time			0
' @entity139 captures these moments and turn them into haptics , visual and tactile sensations to those who buy the product			0
' the resulting artworks were used as part of @entity148 's final degree project at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
movement is art : before testing out the new technology , @entity148 also used a variety of physical mediums , including salt and ink , in order to capture a ballerina 's motion new technology : the ballet shoes use an innovative new system which translates a ballet dancer 's movements using a smartphone app			2
