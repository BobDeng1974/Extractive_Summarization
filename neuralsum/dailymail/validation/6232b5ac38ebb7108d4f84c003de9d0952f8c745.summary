a cow in @entity1 has defied great odds and apparently given birth to four calves that have been named @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity9 said monday that dna tests will be done on tissue samples from the three bull calves and the one heifer calf to satisfy those who may question the births from one mother			2
' we knew she was pregnant , but we did n't know she was going to do this , ' the 76 - year - old @entity9 said			0
' this was a shock			0
' awesome foursome : @entity24 is seen here among newborn calves @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 near @entity27 , @entity1 , on march 16			1
it is incredibly rare for a momma cow to birth four calves rare : the cow , described by @entity24 as ' just a run of the mill red cow ' , had been bred to an @entity36 bull , so all four of the calves are black this momma cow has apparently defied great odds and given birth to four calves			2
dna tests will be done to satisfy those who question the veracity of the calves @entity9 's wife , @entity45 , owns the couple 's 20 or so cattle outside of @entity48 , near the @entity50 and @entity51 borders			2
@entity53 's granddaughter named the four black calves @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity9 said			1
local veterinarian @entity55 called the march 16 births ' extremely rare			1
' he said the odds of four live births from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million			1
@entity55 knows the couple well and is nearly certain the four came from one mother , rather than a nearby cow perhaps birthing one or two and then moving along so that it appeared the four came from the @entity53 's cow			0
' in the interest of science and the animal world , it 's one of those things that need to be verified beyond a shadow of a doubt , ' he said			0
proud : @entity9 shows off two of his new calves , after one of his cows apparently underwent an extremely rare pregnancy and birth the couple watched the birth of the fourth calf after going to check on her when they saw buzzards circling above a field			0
because the mother cow is unable to nurse all four calves , the couple are relying on neighbors to help			0
@entity8 has stayed with her mother , while @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are with two different caretakers			1
@entity6 is the smallest of the calves , weighing in at about 25 pounds			1
a typical healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds			0
standing has also been difficult for some of the quadruplets .			0
