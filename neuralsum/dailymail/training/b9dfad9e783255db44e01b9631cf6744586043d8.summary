by @entity0 published : 14:24 est , 26 may 2012 updated : 06:35 est , 27 may 2012 ' oversight ' : @entity3 co-chairman @entity2 has admitted failing to declare rental income on her @entity6 home in breach of @entity9 rules conservative co-chairman @entity2 is facing calls for an investigation into her expenses over allegations that she claimed for overnight accommodation when staying at a friend 's house rent - free			1
@entity2 , a cabinet minister championed by @entity17 , insists that she made an ' appropriate payment ' for the ' occasional nights ' she stayed at a property occupied , but not owned by @entity3 official @entity21			1
@entity23 mp @entity22 said he would be asking the @entity9 commissioner for standards to investigate			1
mr @entity21 , who later became @entity2 's special adviser , today backed her claim , releasing a statement saying she made a payment each time she stayed at the property			1
however - according to reports in @entity36 and @entity37 - the owner of the property in @entity34 , @entity6 , denies that he received any income from either @entity2 or mr @entity21			1
the 41 - year - old @entity3 peer was at the time claiming @entity40 of £ 165.50 a night from the taxpayer			0
mr @entity22 said : ' if you are paying no rent where you are staying , you ca n't possibly be claiming subsistence for staying there			2
' it all seems very murky			0
we need a full investigation into the matter			1
' in a separate embarrassment for @entity2 , the most senior @entity51 politician in @entity52 , has also admitted failing to declare rental income on a @entity6 flat in the @entity9 register of interests			1
the two revelations are another blow for the prime minister who is already facing the possibility of temporarily losing culture secretary @entity61 over the @entity63 debacle			0
mr @entity17 and @entity2 have both spoken of the importance of a ' transparent government ' and mr @entity17 's ambition to be ' one of the most transparent governments in the world			2
' the smart @entity34 property at the centre of the claims is owned by @entity75 - born gp dr @entity73 , a @entity3 donor and former electoral candidate who is now engaged in a dispute with the party and @entity2			1
@entity2 , a cabinet minister championed by @entity17 , insists that she made an ' appropriate payment ' for the ' occasional nights ' she stayed at a property occupied by @entity3 official @entity21 mr @entity21 said that he stayed at the house belonging to dr @entity73 between july 2007 and november 2008 while working in central @entity6			1
he was living there rent free			2
' in the early part of 2008 , for a short period , @entity2 stayed with me , ' he said in the statement			1
' i confirm she made a financial payment on each occasion , which compensated for the inconvenience caused and additional costs incurred by me as a result of her being there			2
' dr @entity73 , chairman of the @entity98 , said @entity2 had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he did n't ask her for money dr @entity73 , chairman of the @entity98 , told the @entity104 had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he did n't ask her for money			1
he also said he used to give her occasional lifts into central @entity6			2
he admitted to the paper he did n't ask for any money as he was hoping to further his political career			0
meanwhile , @entity2 said her failure to declare rental income on her £ 220,000 flat in @entity113 , @entity6 , was due to an ' oversight ' , adding that she had reported the letting of it in the @entity117			1
the arrangement had also been declared to the @entity119 and @entity120 , she said			0
the peer bought the property in 2007 , when she was just 36 and the youngest peer in the upper chamber , but moved closer to @entity125 when she became a minister in 2010 , after which she began letting the @entity113 flat			0
peers are required to declare sources of income of more than £ 500 , although the annual rent on a @entity6 flat is likely to be many times greater than that			1
in a statement last night , @entity2 said that she contracted to buy the flat in september 2007 , but it was not due to be ready until the following year			2
in the interim she stayed predominantly at two hotels but also , for ' occasional nights ' , at dr @entity73 's @entity34 property occupied by @entity3 adviser mr @entity21			1
' the completion date for the property was slightly delayed , and not having made advanced bookings for these hotels , there was a period of around six weeks when i spent occasional nights at a flat in @entity34 , which was occupied by @entity21 , at the time a member of @entity153 staff , ' she said			1
taking responsibility : the cabinet office minister did not disclose her income in the register of interests for members of the @entity9 ( above ) , but did add it to the @entity117 ' interests ' for the nights that i stayed as a guest of @entity21 , i made an appropriate financial payment equivalent to what i was paying at the time in hotel costs			1
' in march 2008 , i moved into the flat in @entity113			0
as i was living in the property , it was therefore not registrable on the @entity169			0
upon becoming a minister , however , my ownership of this property was fully disclosed to the @entity119			0
@entity23 mp @entity22 said he would be asking the @entity9 commissioner for standards to investigate ' in june 2010 , upon security advice , i moved to another address closer to the @entity9 and some months later began , with the prior approval of the @entity119 and the @entity178 , to let out the @entity113 property			1
' due to an oversight , for which i take full responsibility , the flat was not included on the @entity169 when its value and the rent received came to exceed the thresholds for disclosure , ' she said			2
' when the discrepancy became apparent this week , i immediately informed the registrar of @entity191 of its omission			0
' i repeat , at all times my ownership of the flat and the fact that it was being let out was fully disclosed to @entity119 officials and @entity120 , and was appropriately reported on the register of ministers ' interests held by the government			0
' shadow business minister @entity202 has called for an inquiry			0
he told @entity205 's @entity204 : ' to rebuild trust and demonstrate this is being dealt with in a proper way there has to be a proper , independent investigation			0
' so long as these stories endure , we are going to struggle to rebuild the trust and confidence we need there to be between @entity216 and the people it exists there to serve			0
' @entity2 is the daughter of immigrants from @entity222			2
she failed to be elected in her home town of @entity224 , @entity225 in 2005			0
despite that she was made a shadow minister two years later and her career took off			0
@entity2 's admission comes as it emerged mr @entity61 could temporarily step down from frontline politics after the @entity232 after pressure over his handling of the bid by @entity237 ’s @entity236 to take full control of @entity63 , it was reported in the @entity37			2
yesterday , it was revealed how mr @entity17 ignored legal advice that allowing mr @entity61 to rule on the bid risked ‘ prejudging the affair ’ in the tycoon ’s favour			0
mr @entity61 is due to be questioned under oath at @entity246 ’s inquiry into media standards this week .			0
