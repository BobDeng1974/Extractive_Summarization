if , as expected , @entity2 completes a move to @entity4 in the coming days , the new @entity1 manager @entity0 will be greeted by a dressing room that looks and sounds rather different to the one that @entity7 left behind in april			1
in the blink of an eye , the make - up and personality of the @entity1 squad has radically transformed			0
since the end of the season , @entity1 ’s four most senior players – @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 – have all moved on , although @entity16 ’ services have been retained in his new position as assistant manager			1
the figures are quite remarkable and while a new era dawns with the arrival of @entity26 , it seems remiss of @entity1 to lose so much , so soon			2
the quartet have all captained @entity1 for extended stints , @entity17 and @entity16 together lifting the @entity40 aloft in @entity65 as the two shared responsibilities in 2008			1
@entity18 has twice captained @entity1 to @entity38 glory			1
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 have started in three @entity69 finals , forming the core of a back - line that broke records for consecutive clean sheets in 2009			1
and now , in an instant , it is all over			0
surely it would have been more pragmatic to secure a balance between young legs and old heads			0
these players , who cared deeply for the @entity1 shirt , will be missed			0
@entity1 should have worked harder to retain one of @entity17 and @entity18			1
under sir @entity84 , these wise veterans brought a paternal touch to their task of buttressing the manager ’s authority			0
they acted as model and mentor for the new signings and the academy products that nervously creep into the club ’s @entity94 training ground , offering guidance on the @entity1 way			0
even last season under @entity7 , @entity98 leaned heavily on @entity16 , @entity17 encouraged @entity100 to work on his distribution and @entity18 remained the captain that commanded the respect of his team - mates , even after he had declared his intention to leave in february			1
glory , glory : @entity16 and sir @entity84 celebrate their @entity38 wins with @entity1 @entity109 : @entity16 made 963 appearances for @entity1 and won 34 honours during his career injuries hampered the mobility of @entity17 and @entity18 but on the right occasion , they , along with @entity16 , remained capable of outstanding performances in the showpiece matches			1
you need only watch the tape of @entity17 and @entity18 's flawless demonstration of organisation against @entity122 at @entity123 in march to see that they remained the club 's most accomplished defenders			1
@entity127 gave way to poise in the final years but the trio would deconstruct the game in their minds and anticipate the next act with masterly precision			0
some performances were below par last season but regular observers of @entity1 note that these showings were no worse than the contributions of younger players , such as @entity100 , @entity144 and @entity145			2
tall , lean and athletic , there was once a feeling that @entity100 could be a @entity17 clone at @entity123			1
his form last season sadly rendered that suggestion the stuff of fantasy			0
@entity154 , also , has a way to go if he is to fulfil @entity84 's prediction and become ' one of the best players we have ever had			0
' young guns : @entity154 must up his game as sir @entity84 called him ' one of the best players we have ever had ' clone : @entity100 will try to emulate @entity17 at @entity123 but his form slipped last season @entity100 appearances : 123 ( 5 goals ) honours : 3 ( 2 @entity38 , 3 @entity42 ) @entity154 appearances : 104 ( 5 goals ) honours : 3 ( 1 @entity38 , 2 @entity42 ) perhaps @entity100 and @entity154 will be liberated by responsibility under @entity26 , but there is also a reason that the @entity171 is close to signing @entity172 and considering a move for @entity174 of @entity175			1
the prominent endurance of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 should have been guarded with more care			2
by way of retort , the club would argue that things have not transpired the way they intended			0
@entity18 and @entity2 were not forced out of @entity123			2
sources close to the dressing room suggest that @entity18 had resolved to leave at the end of his contract as early as late september , determined for a fresh challenge following the exit of sir @entity84			0
@entity17 , meanwhile , had already made plans to move back down south with his family by the time that @entity26 was in a position of decision - making power			2
incoming : new @entity1 manager @entity26 has lost experience but will make do with his young guns @entity2 has now decided that the time is right for a move , aware that @entity198 will be the first - choice at left - back and conscious that his wife @entity199 would like to live in @entity201			1
still , though , the @entity202 would have been a fountain of expertise for @entity198 to tap into and his continued presence would lift some of the pressure off the 18 - year - old 's young shoulders			0
@entity1 will survive and move on , of course			0
young talents like @entity98 , @entity198 and @entity211 and @entity198 will guarantee that			0
pre-season will be a processions of hellos as @entity26 bounds into town but @entity1 may come to reflect that they should have been a little less hasty to say some very emotional goodbyes			2
beaming : @entity198 completed his £ 31.5m move to @entity1 from @entity219 star in the making : @entity1 ace @entity98 will try and grasp his opportunity under @entity26 will he get the chance ? @entity211 will try to impress @entity26 to get time on the pitch at @entity123			1

@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 made 2,097 appearances and won 80 medals *collectively* with @entity1
that *includes* *29* @entity38 , five @entity40 and five @entity39
@entity16 retains place at @entity123 as assistant manager to @entity0
@entity154 and @entity100 expected to step up under @entity235 boss
@entity26 close to signing @entity237 's @entity172 and considering move for @entity175 's @entity174
