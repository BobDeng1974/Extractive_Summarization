@entity2 used his @entity54 account to respond to the allegations after they first came to light , and said : ' i 'm not a racist			1
i am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near @entity61			0
' but in contrast , @entity5 executive producer @entity62 said he regretted the ' light - hearted ' wordplay and realised ' that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas '			2
@entity62 made the statement after @entity68 - born ms @entity47 instructed lawyers to make a formal complaint about the use of the word , which she described as ' casual racism '			1
in a statement , mr @entity62 said : ' when we used the word " slope " in the recent @entity79 special it was a light - hearted wordplay joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local @entity18 man who was crossing it			1
' we were not aware at the time , and it has subsequently been brought to our attention , that the word " slope " is considered by some to be offensive and although it might not be widely recognised in the @entity87 , we appreciate that it can be considered offensive to some here and overseas , for example in @entity91 and the @entity92			2

he said : ' @entity273 cars are just going to be lazy , feckless , flatulent , leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat			0
' the @entity273 ambassador @entity284 did make a formal complaint to the @entity48 and called on the presenters to make a public apology for stirring ' bigoted feelings against the @entity273 people '			0
' ordinarily i do n't respond to newspaper allegations , but on this occasion i feel i must make an exception			0
' a couple of years ago i recorded an item for @entity5 , in which i quoted the rhyme @entity102 , @entity104 , @entity105			0
' now , of course , i was well aware that in the best known version of this rhyme , there is a racist expression that i was extremely keen to avoid			0
' the full rushes show that i did three takes			0
' in two i mumbled where the offensive word would normally occur and in the third , i replaced it all together with the word " teacher "			0
' now when i viewed this footage , several weeks later , i realised that in one of the mumbled versions , if you listen very carefully with the sound turned right up , it did appear that i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure			0
' i was mortified by this , horrified , it is a word i loathe			0
' and i did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted			0
' in fact , i have here the note i sent at the time to the production office			0
' and it says , " i did n't use the n - word here but i 've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like i did			1
is there another take that we could use ? " ' please be assured i did everything in my power to not use that word			0
' and as i 'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts were n't quite good enough			0
