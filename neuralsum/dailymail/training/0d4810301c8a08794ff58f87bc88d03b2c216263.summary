by @entity0 a @entity2 mad @entity1 may have taken the title of greatest ever father after building his son a @entity7 suit			1
by using the mini @entity9 figurine as a source of inspiration , costume king , @entity13 , 41 , from @entity14 , has been able to replicate the iconic character with incredible accuracy			1
the graphic designer has spent over 100 hours building the child - sized bounty hunter for his @entity2 mad son , @entity20 , seven			1
at a convention far , far away ... @entity13 with his amazing @entity7 costume may the force be with him : @entity24 shows off the @entity7 costume without the helmet and it ’s no surprise that the fantastic suit took first place at this year ’s @entity31 convention in @entity14			1
both huge fans of the @entity2 series and the @entity9 brand , mr @entity13 has previously made two other @entity9 mini figure designs for his son , learning and perfecting his craft with each attempt			1
constructed using using @entity38 , a lightweight but rigid pvc material , mr @entity13 was able to construct the torso , hands , jetpack , antenna , legs and most of the helmet			0
while inside the helmet , mr @entity13 used pink insulation foam board to carve the dome shape and a closed cell foam called @entity50 to carve the rocket tips and exhausts found on the jetpack			0
out of this world : the @entity7 suit took first place at this year 's @entity31 convention in @entity14 but it 's the attention to detail that really makes the suit something special			1
not only was the costume spray painted and clear coated but mr @entity13 even printed vinyl adhesives to copy the graphics on the tiny toy			0
if that is n't enough , both the antenna and jetpack are in fact removable , just like the @entity9 version of the cult character , giving his son , @entity20 , a welcome break from the full weight of the suit and turning him into a real living , breathing @entity75			2
however , mr @entity13 has an even more ambitious idea in the pipeline and hopes to create a @entity9 mini figure costume of a character that has not even yet been built by @entity9			1
mr @entity13 said : ‘ i 've been a fan of @entity2 for 35 years and never made a @entity2 costume until now , if i had n't a child , perhaps i would still be saying the same thing			1
the real deal : @entity84 as bounty hunter @entity7 in the 1980 hit film @entity2 ‘ i 've turned my attention from sculpting my own work to making costumes for him			1
we love the @entity9 culture and @entity7 is a great character to recreate			2
‘ every @entity94 figure would be awesome to build , but @entity7 is so lush with colour , and has details that are both challenging and visually appealing			0
‘ making a @entity2 costume for a child is cool - children are the perfect dimensions to bring the mini figure to life			2
‘ @entity20 has an extensive @entity9 collection that includes among others , @entity2			2
his love for the movies , characters and mini figures sort of rebooted my passion for both the @entity2 fan culture and the @entity9 brand			2
‘ i think the mini figure is reflected in a child			0
they share an innocence and playfulness and i believe that 's why people react so positively to these types of costumes			0
‘ considering this costume was both @entity2 and @entity9 , i was confident that it would be well received by fans of both communities			1
however , i never anticipated the costume going viral			0
‘ my partner is very supportive of my projects and loves the results			0
however , she 's not a fan of both the mental and environmental chaos they create			0
ultimately , she knows why i do it , for my son , and that makes her happy			0
