by @entity0 @entity1 risked an own goal last night over claims that he has used a professional voice coach to boost his flagging ratings			1
the @entity6 has been told that the @entity8 leader has had lessons in how to sound more appealing and inspiring from television continuity announcer @entity10 , who helps bankers and businessmen get their messages across			1
the claims come just 24 hours after mr @entity1 said he had no time for ‘ politics driven by image , ’ declaring : ‘ if you want the politician from central casting , it ’s just not me , it ’s the other guy			1
mr @entity10 says he uses ‘ the sheer physicality of theatrical expression ... to help people communicate in ways that are visual , powerful and inspiring ’			1
he claims to ‘ unblock ’ his clients and ‘ harness their physical powers to provide inspiring leadership ’ – a boast which may expose mr @entity1 to more jokes , bearing in mind jibes about his ‘ nasal ’ tone			1
shortly after becoming @entity8 leader , he underwent a nose operation to help with his sleep apnoea , though it does not appear to have improved his voice			1
mr @entity10 , whose clients include @entity48 , drugs giant @entity49 , and @entity50 , works for the @entity51 , which helps would - be leaders from all walks of life			1
its website declares mr @entity10 ‘ pre-coaches clients and gives new confidence and freedom ’			2
it also explains the organisation is made up of ‘ performing artists , political scientists , philosophers , historians and organisational psychologists ’			0
@entity10 says he uses ' the sheer physicality of theatrical expression ... to help people communicate in ways that are visual , powerful and inspiring ' its aim is to ‘ help people lose their ego and find how to create the energy needed to integrate @entity75 , thinking and @entity76			2
‘ leaders are accountable for giving away leadership to the best person for the job in hand			0
using a model of @entity84 , we take them on a journey that helps them discover how to realise their ambition			0
’ it says its methods draw on ‘ the great tradition of the mediaeval troubadour and renaissance minstrel , the role of the “ singer of tales ” , the wandering performer who fuses music , storytelling , drama and the power of words to awaken and unite audiences in many lands ’			0
successfully used , it can ‘ connect clients with the true but hitherto untapped potential within themselves … towards fresh thinking , courageous authenticity , and deeper emotional empathy ’			0
the website gives examples of questions asked by clients , which sound distinctly like the kind of questions @entity1 may have been tempted to ask , such as : ‘ i want to believe we are doing the right thing			2
but i ’m not sure – and neither is anyone else ... is there a way we can be more sure ? ’ it continues : ‘ our clients come to us because they want to increase the bandwidth of inspirational engagement			0
our learning programmes include coaching , seminars , theatrical scenarios , visual group work and practical training , drawing on performing arts , psychology , politics and ethics			0
’ asked what was the weirdest voiceover job he had ever done , mr @entity10 once said : ‘ i was the voice of an air conditioner for an air conditioning company and their in - house video			2
and i was the voiceover for miss @entity144			0
’ @entity146 , the @entity148 ’s @entity147 friend and speechwriter , also works with the @entity51			0
