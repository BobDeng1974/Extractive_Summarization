@entity0 has built the world 's fastest supercomputer - almost twice as fast as the previous @entity4 record holder - with speeds equivalent to more than 338 million normal @entity6 the @entity7 , which means @entity8 2 , was developed by the @entity9 in @entity0 's @entity11 city and is capable of sustained computing of 33.86 petaflops per second			1
that 's the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second , with the average everyday computer performing around 100 million per second ( although some are faster and others may be slower )			1
@entity0 's supercomputer @entity7 has been declared the @entity20 fastest supercomputer title			1
it was developed by the country 's @entity9 and is capable of operating at the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second @entity0 's @entity7 supercomputer , which means @entity8 2 , knocked the @entity4 @entity27 's @entity26 machine off the number one spot			1
the @entity0 government sponsored the project and did n't expect the computer to be fully functional until 2015 1			2
@entity41 - @entity0 the results were published in the @entity20 report , an official bi-annual listing of the world 's faster supercomputers			1
according to this list , the @entity4 , dominates the top ten with computers in second , third , fifth , sixth and eighth place			2
@entity33 's k computer is in fourth spot			2
@entity37 's @entity38 and @entity40 are in seventh and ninth place , while @entity7 's predecessor , @entity41 , is tenth			2
the @entity41 was first in november 2010 and @entity33 's k computer overtook in 2011			2
each computer on the list was tested against the @entity58 benchmark			0
the @entity59 is used as a ' yardstick of performance ' and was chosen because it is widely used across all relevant systems			0
the @entity0 government said it intends to install the @entity7 equipment at the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity0 where it will be used for ' research and education '			1
supercomputers such as the @entity7 are used for simulating nuclear explosions and designing jetliners according to @entity58 , the @entity7 operates at 33.86 petaflop / sec - the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second			1
this benchmark measures how the computers would perform in real - world environments , yet if the supercomputer was boosted to peak performance , this could theoretically increase to 54.9 petaflop / sec - 54,900 trillion calculations			1
it knocked the @entity4 @entity27 's @entity26 machine off the number one spot , which only achieved 17.59 petaflops per second			1
the @entity0 government sponsored the project and did n't expect the computer to be fully functional until 2015			2
it said it intends to install the equipment at the @entity65 in @entity66 where it will be used for ' research and education '			0
' most of the features of the system were developed in @entity0 , and they are only using @entity94 for the main compute part , ' said @entity20 editor @entity96 other supercomputers to make the top five in the twice - yearly @entity20 list include the @entity26 , @entity32 and @entity35 computers as well as @entity33 's k computer in fourth spot			1
while @entity7 's predecessor , @entity41 , is tenth after topping the list in november 2010 ' that is , the interconnect , operating system , front - end processors and software are mainly @entity0 , ' said @entity96 , who toured the @entity7 development facility in may			1
the twice - yearly list is overseen by @entity112 , professor of computer science at the @entity114 and this current list was published to coincide with the @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity37			0
last month , technology company @entity118 announced it was putting its own supercomputer called @entity120 to work in a robot call centre			0
the artificially intelligent computer system is taking on the role of customer service manager and will be called @entity125			0
companies will be able to sign up to @entity118 's service and its customers can then ring a helpline and complain or get help from the @entity131 ( @entity133 ) machine			0
@entity120 has previously taken part in @entity4 quiz show jeopardy , and has helped medical research teams diagnose illnesses in patients			0
the @entity139 invited teams to design mobile apps using @entity120 's , pictured , cognitive computing capabilities			0
the 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging , after which only five teams will present proposals to @entity118			0
three winners will get access to the @entity120 's developer platform customers will be able to ask the @entity154 questions by phone , email and instant messaging			0
a smartphone app called ' @entity159 ' ( pictured ) is due to launch later this year			0

@entity0 's @entity7 supercomputer is double the speed of the previous @entity4 world record holder , @entity26
it can perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second was built by @entity0 's @entity9
the average computer performs around 100 million calculations per second
