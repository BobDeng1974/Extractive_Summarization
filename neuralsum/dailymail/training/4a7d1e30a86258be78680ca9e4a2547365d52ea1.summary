after a summer witnessing crowds of screaming girls jostling to catch a glimpse of @entity6 diver @entity5 's toned torso , there ca n't have been many young men who did n't feel a twinge of jealousy			0
but now it seems there could be more to having the teenager 's athletic physique than unfailing female attention - it could help you live longer too			2
a team of researchers from @entity19 have found muscular boys will live longer than their weaker friends			1
a new study has claimed muscular teenage boys could live longer than their weaker school friends			1
@entity6 diver @entity25 , 18 , has achieved his athletic physique through years of training and even if they are overweight by the time they get to adulthood , those with stronger muscles tend to live longer			1
the team tracked more than one million @entity19 male adolescents , all conscripts to the army and aged 16 to 19 , over a period of 24 years			1
the teenagers were asked to grip and to do leg curls and arm push ups as a test of muscle strength			0
the scientists found those with low strength , weak legs and arms and with a limp grip , were more likely to die earlier			2
the report also suggests that physically weaker people might be more mentally vulnerable			1
but the study , published in the @entity53 , stressed that it does not mean building muscle through excessive weight training would make you live longer			2
they have concluded that a basis of muscle strength instead reflects general fitness			0
over the course of the study , 26,145 of the men died			0
the @entity19 researchers concluded that muscle strength reflects general fitness the leading single cause of death was accidental injury , followed by suicide , cancer , heart disease and stroke			1
a third of the deaths were due to other causes and the researchers grouped these together for their calculations			2
the teenagers who scored above average on muscular strength at the start of the study had a 20 to 35 per cent lower risk of early death from any cause and also from cardiovascular diseases			0
they also had a 20 to 30 per cent lower risk of early death from suicide and were up to 65 per cent less likely to have any psychiatric diagnosis , such as schizophrenia or depression			0
but the 16 to 19 year olds with the lowest level of muscular strength had the highest risk of dying before they reached their middle ages			0
while the effect of poor muscular fitness in those observed was similar to other risk factors for early death , such as obesity and high blood pressure , researchers still found the link between early death and muscle power remained after the other factors were taken into account			1
the study also found thin and fat men alike fared worse in terms of life expectancy if they had weaker than average muscles , while more muscular men had better survival odds even if they were overweight			1
but experts stress the findings do not mean muscle building through excessive weight training makes you live longer .			0

researchers tracked more than one million @entity19 male adolescents over 24 years
they found stronger boys lived longer , even if they became overweight adults
physically weaker people might be more mentally vulnerable , it was suggested
