a third was damaged when thieves cut the artworks from a choir screen at 15th - century @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			2
the panels are as rare as a @entity13 or @entity14 , said an expert , who feared they may have been stolen to order			1
examination : dr @entity17 , from the @entity18 , examines the remaining damaged panels and the gaping hole left following the theft ' priceless ' : two mid- 15th century panels depicting medieval saints were stolen from the church in @entity11 the painted panels which depicted @entity26 of @entity27 and @entity28 before they were stolen ‘ paintings of @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 are two a penny in @entity36 churches , which is why it is possible these thieves targeted lesser saints as they are much rarer , ’ said dr @entity17 , an arts historian with the @entity18			1
‘ this is the best example of this type of medieval art in this country			2
they are as unique and priceless as a @entity13 or a @entity14 and are irreplaceable			1
they are intrinsic to this building and the theft devalues the whole church			2
’ the panels , about 18in by 6in , were part of a series of 40 depicting @entity31 , @entity32 , the @entity33 and other saints set in a rood or choir screen that was a common feature in medieval church architecture			1
investigation : thieves used a knife to rip out the panels , leaving a hole in the screen and damaging a third artwork in the process the damage where the panels were ripped free after thieves used knives to cut them loose dr @entity17 : the paintings are intrinsic to this building and the theft devalues the whole church ' those stolen featured @entity26 of @entity27 and @entity72 , while the one that was left damaged pictured a female saint			1
the panels were once whitewashed to protect them from the puritanical zeal of the @entity79 , when many of the intricate screens , especially those that included representations of saints , were taken down			2
' rare ' : the panels belonged to one section of the screen that spans the aisles of the historic church dr @entity17 said the panels were of ‘ cathedral quality ’			1
‘ they have been painted by a specially commissioned artist who would have been a top artist of his day , ’ he added			0
‘ they are contemporary to when the church was built			2
it shows there was a lot of money around here at the time , mostly from the wool trade			0
historic : the 15th century church deep in the @entity11 countryside was targeted by thieves in a ' devastating ' blow ‘ unless the damage to one panel was an accident , it is difficult to understand why those who did it bashed it when they did such a delicate job of removing the other two			1
’ experts believe the paintings may have been stolen due to their rarity			2
the panels have been described as ' the best example of this type of panels in this country ' and ' as unique and priceless as a @entity13 or a @entity14 '			1
the panels in the @entity127 church have survived ' exceptionally ' well from the late medieval period and feature lesser saints , making them much rarer than paintings of @entity31 , @entity32 and the apostles			1
it is also believed the artist was specially commissioned to produce the panels for the screens due to the ' very high status ' of the artistry involved			1
the church itself was built in the 15th century and is designated by @entity140 as a grade 1 listed building			0
a number of other panels have been stolen in the past but @entity144 , the chief executive of the @entity18 charity , said the @entity147 screen remained ‘ probably the best preserved medieval rood screen in the country ’			0
‘ they are fantastic examples of craftsmanship of the time , ’ he said			0
‘ the value of these panels is in the building , they belong there			0
’ @entity157 is open to the public and still hosts services			0
dr @entity17 admitted that it would not have been difficult for the thieves to carry out the crime because of the trust ’s policy of trying to keep churches open			0
‘ we do not want locked doors and people turning up and not being able to get in , ’ he said			0
‘ but we take a risk if someone ’s determined enough they are going to come in and steal			0
’ while acknowledging that the panels were essentially priceless because of their rarity			0
he added : ‘ someone may pay a lot of money for them or they may be sold at a car boot sale for ten quid – we really do n’t know			0
