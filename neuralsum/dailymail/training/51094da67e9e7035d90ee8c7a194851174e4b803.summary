by @entity0 created 8:45 pm on 26th june 2011 escape : @entity2 was nearly abducted in the same week @entity3 was snatched by @entity4 @entity2 was stopped by a chubby man in a red car as she walked home from school aged 11			1
she repeatedly tried to report the incident to police , but they did n't take a statement for three years			2
last friday the jury deliberating a charge of attempted abduction by @entity17 's killer @entity4 was discharged without reaching a verdict			1
yesterday miss @entity2 , now a 21 - year - old student nurse , told the @entity20 : ' i am very angry and hurt			1
' [ when the jury was discharged ] i burst into tears			2
' this whole thing has been very difficult and frightening , both recognising @entity25 in court and giving evidence			0
' i just want to be able to draw a line in the sand and move on			0
' seconds after @entity31 refused a lift from the man in 2002 , a police car passed and he sped off			1
miss @entity2 and her parents @entity36 and @entity37 were convinced that her would - be attacker was @entity17 's killer			1
for three years , every time there was an appeal about the unsolved murder or a new press report appeared , miss @entity2 's mother would ring @entity44 and offer to make a statement about the stranger			1
each time , she was told the force had no record of previous calls , that this one would definitely be logged and someone would call back – but they never did			0
miss @entity2 , pictured right in 2002 , was just 11 when she was approached by a man she says fits @entity4 's description while on her way home from school the barrister who defended @entity4 has come in for increasing criticism in the wake of the trial			1
@entity17 ’s sister @entity61 branded @entity63 ’s cross-examination of her parents the worst day of her life			0
mr @entity66 's , pictured , has a bulldog reputation for fighting the corner of defendants accused of terrible violence , including @entity71 in his successful appeal against his conviction for murdering tv presenter @entity74			0
last night @entity75 , the uncle of @entity76 , who was murdered by @entity25 in 2003 , said : ‘ he needs to explain whether his motive was genuine belief that his line of defence was correct , or was it just the lure of notoriety and state money ? ’ miss @entity2 added : ' i feel very lucky that i got away			1
when it came out about @entity17 it really hit me that it could have been me			0
' i genuinely felt that i could put [ the experience ] to good use to help find @entity17 's killer			0
' her mother , 50 , a secondary school science technician , said : ' it had to be more than a coincidence that @entity2 was approached on the road where @entity17 went missing			2
' two girls , in two days – surely there had to be a connection ? ' the police were n't taking us seriously			0
' in the end we had to write to the chief constable , and it was only then , three years later , that they came to take @entity2 's statement			2
' miss @entity2 , in smart navy uniform and striped tie , with a dusting of freckles on her cheeks and brown eyes , bore an uncanny resemblance to @entity17 as she walked to her home in @entity112 , @entity113 , in march 2002			2
she said the driver beckoned her over , but soon after ' a police car drove towards us on the opposite side of the road and i think it spooked him and he sped off ' .			0

jury unable to *decide* whether @entity4 tried to snatch @entity2 the day before @entity3
a previous *version* of this *article* reported that @entity2 accused police of *robbing* her of justice . in fact @entity31 has *publicly* thanked @entity44 for their hard work on the case . neither she nor her family hold police *responsible* for the @entity131 are happy to *clarify* @entity31 ’ position .
