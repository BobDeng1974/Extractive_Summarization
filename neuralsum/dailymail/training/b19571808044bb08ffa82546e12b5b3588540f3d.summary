the former colleagues of the ex-solider charged with killing @entity3 sniper author @entity2 and another man say the veteran on trial in @entity7 is not the @entity8 they had come to know in @entity9			1
they say @entity10 respected and cherished people who had jobs like former @entity13			2
@entity10 , 27 , is charged with capital murder after allegedly killing @entity2 and his friend @entity15 at a gun range in @entity17 , @entity7 , in february 2013			1
he is on trial for murdering @entity3 sniper author @entity2 and @entity15 at a shooting range in @entity7 in 2013 @entity2 , a former @entity23 and author of @entity25 was allegedly shot to death by @entity10 members of the @entity28 8 for the @entity8 - @entity10 's unit ( he is is second from from left ) - pose for a picture at @entity20 in @entity9 men who served with ' @entity32 ' in @entity28 8 at @entity20 in 2007 and 2008 believe something must have happened to turn him from a gung - ho @entity8 into an alleged double murderer			1
former cpl. @entity36 said : ' the @entity10 i knew looked up to people who did that kind of job			2
' he respected war fighters like you would n't believe			0
' none of us who deployed with him know what 's wrong			2
'' we want to know what 's wrong , and we want him to get help			0
' because all of us kind of have the collective feeling of , you know , we let our brother down			0
' a solider who shared a metal trailer with @entity10 at @entity20 , @entity56 , said : ' it just does n't fathom			2
' he was n't the picture - perfect @entity8 , even though that 's what he wanted to be			0
' and the people he looked up to the most were people like @entity2			2
' he always wanted to be those people - be the people that @entity8 from now on will always be talking about			0
' prosecutors will seek life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty if @entity10 ( above ) is convicted @entity10 ( seen in 2008 ) was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back to the @entity3 from his military service @entity72 , the wife of the murdered former @entity23 , has been in court watching the capital murder trial shortly after the unit reached @entity20 , @entity10 was ordered help guard @entity9 prisoners at @entity78 , although @entity10 had no love for the captured fighters , @entity56 said he was disturbed at how they were treated			1
he told @entity56 some guards would use the leashed prisoners ' heads to push open the metal cell doors and ' he just did n't feel like that was called for '			0
@entity56 did see a glimmer of the man he knew when @entity10 confessed and asked if he could apologize to the families of @entity2 and @entity15			1
he said : ' i 'd love to have an hour to just sit down with him and talk to him			0
' i would put money on it , that he was n't in his right mind			0
' that there was something going on that , he made an unconscious decision to make that mistake			0
' men who served with ' @entity32 ' say something must have happened to turn him into an alleged double murderer @entity10 reportedly wanted to meet with @entity2 's parents , @entity102 and @entity103 ( above ) , so he could apologize to them @entity10 was hospitalized multiple times for mental health issues and had trouble keeping a job after he came back from his military service			1
his defense has argued that when @entity10 killed @entity2 and @entity15 ' he was in the grip of a psychosis ' so severe he did n't know it was wrong			1
' the prosecution has argued otherwise and said that @entity10 killed the two men because he was upset @entity2 had brought @entity15 to the range , @entity113 reported			1
a psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution , dr @entity118 , said : ' [ @entity10 ] did n't have issues with @entity2 [ @entity2 ] , only @entity117 [ @entity15 ] , but because @entity2 would shoot him for shooting @entity117 , he had to shoot @entity2			1
' and that makes sense and is not psychotic thinking			0
" prosecutors will seek life in prison without parole if @entity10 is convicted instead of the death penalty			1

@entity10 's comrades think something must have happened to him
he is on trial for killing @entity3 sniper author @entity2 and another man
@entity2 and @entity15 were killed at a gun range in @entity17 , @entity7
@entity10 , 27 , was hospitalized for mental health issues after his service
prosecutors want a life sentence and not death penalty if he is convicted
