@entity0 strutted out of @entity1 and was the last player to board @entity4 's team bus , having been first to pretty much everything else for his team during a hard - earned win on @entity8			1
it brought two more goals for the @entity11 against @entity12			1
that 's 17 in 26 games this season and 10 in his last 12 , one of the best strike rates in @entity18			2
while @entity20 is cherished by supporters down the road at @entity23 , some @entity4 fans have yet to embrace @entity0 fully			1
the statistics speak for themselves , however			0
@entity4 striker @entity0 has been dubbed ' world class ' by his manager @entity26 the @entity11 scored two goals for @entity4 as the @entity28 ran out 2 - 1 winners against @entity12 @entity26 believes that @entity0 has developed significantly since joining @entity4 back in 2012 @entity0 now has eight goals in six games against @entity12 , including scoring with all five headers on target against them in the @entity35			1
and even though @entity0 is 29 in september , @entity26 believes the best is yet to come from a 6ft 4in striker who developed late and was still playing lower league football in @entity11 as recently as 2010			1
asked if @entity0 is world - class , @entity26 said : ' i think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it			1
but i believe there is still room for improvement			0
' technically , he is a much better player than he was			0
his touch , his link play , his finishing , they have all improved			0
if you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now , it is obvious he is a better player			0
' he is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength			0
at 22 or 23 he played in @entity55 in @entity11 , and now he is at @entity4			1
' @entity0 is refusing to write off @entity4 's chances of a late push for the @entity35 title this season @entity0 's goals gave @entity4 a sixth straight league win and kept them on the fringe of the title race			1
but you wonder how much closer they would be had he not spent three months on the sidelines after breaking his leg at @entity68 in august			0
@entity26 's side won only three of nine league games in his absence			1
while retaining the @entity74 would appear to represent their best chance of a trophy this season , the former @entity73 man has not given up the title chase just yet			2
' we need to win every game and that 's what we want to do â€” step by step , ' said @entity0			1
' you never know if @entity84 or @entity85 will miss one of these steps			2
we 've got to be here with great belief and faith			0
' @entity0 's brace against @entity12 has brought his tally for the season up to 17 goals in 26 games @entity4 still had to hold on in the face of a fierce second - half fightback from @entity12 that revived memories of a famous 4 - 4 draw in 2011			1
it was not enough to prevent a third defeat in a row for the home side , placing even more importance on the forthcoming @entity104 with @entity105			0
having admitted in the build - up to this game that he expects a clear - out of players in the summer , caretaker boss @entity106 is already looking forward to some of the big signings coming through the door			2
' without naming any names , i 've seen some of the players they are talking about and i 'm quite excited about them , ' said @entity106			0
' it 's major work that has to be done , we know that			0
i know the type of players the fans like and they 're the ones on the list , absolutely			0
