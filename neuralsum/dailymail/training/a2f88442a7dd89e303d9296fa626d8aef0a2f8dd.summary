@entity23 added : ' some doctors view @entity13 as cosmetic because some children do n't need to operation but in reality it can be fatal			2

@entity10 had to wait until he was three - and - a - half before he underwent the operation at @entity110 in @entity111 to correct his skull the family said @entity10 has made a remarkable recovery from his operation and his hair has since grown over his zig - zag scars ' since @entity10 's skull surgery and windpipe surgery life has become physical easier for us and are now spending more time together as a family			1
there is a risk that @entity10 's skull may re fuse again			1
if this was to happen it would mean more surgery			0
@entity145 , the group administrator for headlines , the craniofacial support group said : ' normally when a child is born the skull is made of individual plates			2
if the plates have prematurely fused , the brain will grow but may make the skull shape different			1
' the child could have brain damage or pressure on the brain if left untreated			0
' after the end of the year old single suture children will not normally face anymore surgery			0
if the child has a syndrome they will receive treatment at various times up to their teenage years			0
