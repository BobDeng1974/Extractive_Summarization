by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 17:19 est , 17 july 2012 a mother whose daughter suffered nappy burns had her children taken into care because social services wrongly thought she had scalded her deliberately			1
@entity9 , 25 , found three - year - old @entity10 with injuries after her nappy burst and leaked water - absorbing crystals on to her legs			1
she took her to hospital , but when doctors examined her , they called police and miss @entity9 was arrested on suspicion of abusing the little girl by scalding her with hot water			1
reunited : @entity9 with her children @entity20 and @entity10 who were taken into care for eight months @entity10 and her six - year - old brother @entity20 were taken into care while the false allegations were investigated , and pregnant miss @entity9 was warned she could also lose her unborn son @entity26 , who is now six months old			1
the nightmare only came to an end eight months later after an independent medical expert finally proved @entity10 ’s injuries were caused by a chemical burn from the crystals in the burst nappy			2
the family have now been reunited , but miss @entity9 believes her children are still affected by ‘ the worst time in my whole life ’			1
the nightmare began in may last year when full - time mother @entity37 woke to find @entity10 ’s nappy had burst , spilling chemical crystals on to her skin			1
@entity9 said she was told doctors were fearful of missing another case ' like @entity43 ' fearful : @entity9 says she now panics every time she takes her children for medical check - ups miss @entity9 treated the area with @entity49 nappy rash cream , but when it had not healed days later , she took @entity10 to @entity51			1
within hours , miss @entity9 and partner @entity52 , 23 , were arrested			0
@entity10 ’s biological father was arrested the next day			0
miss @entity9 said : ‘ they said they were trying to protect @entity10 and did not want another @entity43 case			1
’ miss @entity9 protested her innocence , claiming she had changed from @entity60 nappies to a supermarket own - brand which were prone to leaking and must have caused the painful burns			0
but social services placed her children with their paternal grandmother , and miss @entity9 ’s contact with them was restricted under her bail conditions			2
when the case came before @entity68 , @entity69 , a specialist in burns and plastic surgery at @entity51 , said she believed the injury was ‘ most probably a scald ’			2
however , miss @entity9 secured a review and an independent expert , retired forensic burns consultant @entity75 , confirmed the injury was a ‘ chemical burn ’ due to the burst nappy			0
in his report , he said the rash was a reaction to ‘ prolonged contact on a flat surface with a relatively weak chemical			0
exacerbated by soakage due to a large amount of urine or faeces ’			0
miss @entity9 was released from her bail conditions last november and no charges were brought			0
she was finally allowed to take her children home in january			2
she said : ‘ we are trying to have some sort of normal life now but @entity20 is still affected by it			2
’ a spokesman for @entity51 said : ‘ patient safety is the number one priority and we have a legal obligation to follow safeguarding policies and procedures			0
’ a spokesman for @entity68 social services said : ‘ when concerns are raised by clinicians , we have to carry out a full and detailed investigation			0

mother says her children are still affected by our forced *separation* last year
said doctors told her they were worried of missing another ' @entity43 ' case
