by @entity0 last updated at 11:11 pm on 10th january 2012 @entity1 pledged to create a fairer @entity2 if the party was re-elected @entity1 pleaded with voters and his party not to write him off yesterday as he launched a fresh bid to win back credibility on the economy			1
the @entity11 leader insisted he has the ‘ inner belief ’ to win the next election			1
but , in a major admission , he appeared to accept that @entity11 would not be able to go on spending and will have to promise further cuts if it is to win power in 2015			2
shadow chancellor @entity18 went further , saying @entity11 ‘ can make no commitment to reverse any of the government ’s tax rises or spending cuts ’			1
with @entity11 trailing the @entity23 in polling on the economy , he admitted : ‘ i know , and @entity1 does , that @entity11 ’s got a credibility issue			1
’ but the party ’s economic policy was mired in even more confusion last night after mr @entity18 blew up in an interview on @entity30 when asked why @entity11 plans to borrow more money than the @entity23			1
‘ do n’t lecture me on borrowing , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 claimed he was prepared to make tough choices to cut the national budget deficit			1
but the only concrete measure he offered was to declare that he would not uprate the value of @entity37 in line with inflation			0
he then set out a wish - list that would end up costing billions of pounds – including backing a nationwide campaign to substitute a ‘ living wage ’ of £ 7.20 an hour for the minimum wage of £ 6.08			0
mr @entity1 said only @entity11 can deliver fairness when there 's less money around and brushed off leadership criticism the @entity11 leader admitted welfare reforms were necessary but then said he was personally ‘ a supporter ’ of universal benefits , which would make it impossible to cut costs by means - testing some state handouts			1
in an interview with @entity57 , mr @entity1 flatly rejected the recent verdict of his policy guru @entity59 , that his leadership had been ‘ crap ’			1
@entity1 arrives at the @entity62 this morning for the speech with shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity64 ‘ i do n’t agree with him when he says it is all crap , ’ he said , dismissing the growing chorus of criticism as ‘ noises off ’ and internal ructions over his leadership as ‘ the @entity70 of politics ’			2
he insisted : ‘ do n’t declare the result of the race when it is not yet half run			0
i have a very strong inner belief that i will win the race			0
’ later , in a speech to the @entity81 , mr @entity1 attempted to flesh out his call for a crackdown on ‘ predator ’ companies such as banks , energy companies and credit card firms			1
he said a @entity11 government would introduce legislation to ensure that energy firms gave a fair deal to the elderly			2
‘ to help pensioners , those energy companies should be forced by law to guarantee to all those over 75 the lowest tariff			1
it is not fair to those people that they are being ripped off and overcharged , ’ he said			0
‘ that is a concrete example of how you can make your society fairer in a world where there is less money			0
’ he also pledged to tax the banks more heavily to keep university tuition fees capped at £ 6,000 a year rather than £ 9,000 as at present			0
@entity110 , the party ’s business spokesman , will make further proposals on curbing executive pay tomorrow and mr @entity18 will make a keynote speech on the economy on saturday			2
but mr @entity1 ’s critics refused to give him credit for acknowledging economic reality – a full 20 months after @entity11 ’s former treasury chief secretary @entity119 left a note telling his ministerial successor : ‘ there ’s no money left			1
’ @entity124 , a former special adviser to leading @entity126 @entity125 , was quick to dismiss mr @entity1 ’s performance , saying it had ‘ more than a touch of the @entity130 about it ’			1
@entity11 ’s high command has been at pains to dismiss comparisons with mr @entity130 ’s doomed leadership of the @entity136 as ‘ wide of the mark ’			2
@entity59 ( left ) said mr @entity1 had ' no strategy , no narrative and little energy ’ and denounced @entity18 's ( right ) economic policies as ' all c * * p ' last week @entity59 compounded mr @entity1 ’s problems			1
cornered by a tv crew after the speech , he first said @entity11 ’s message was clearer			2
but when asked ‘ really ? ’ with the camera lowered , he shrugged his shoulders and reportedly said ‘ no. ’ @entity1 flatly rejected the verdict of his former adviser , @entity59 , that his leadership had been ' crap ' during a @entity57 programme today ' i do n't agree with him when he says it is all c * * p , ' he said @entity158 deputy chairman @entity157 said : ‘ if @entity1 was serious about taking tough decisions , he ’d set out a credible plan for cutting the deficit as @entity162 , @entity163 and half the @entity164 have demanded			1
if he seriously accepts there ’s less money to spend , he would stop making billions of new unfunded spending promises and instead tell us what @entity11 would cut			0
instead , @entity1 has given us another relaunch but still no credibility			0
’ mr @entity18 warned the belt - tightening would have to go much further			0
while he said the government was cutting ‘ recklessly fast ’ – choking off economic growth – @entity11 would still face ‘ difficult decisions ’ in office			0
‘ we would have to have cuts in police , we would have to have cuts in the schools budget , we would have to have cuts in the defence budget , ’ he told @entity57 ’s @entity176			0
split : the party is said to be divided on over whether to apologise for the mistakes of the @entity187 and @entity188 years many people have spent months calling for @entity190 to take over @entity11 's crown from his brother but this morning the @entity57 appeared to join the debate too when it accidentally announced @entity190 's speech was ' coming up '			2
as reporters waited for @entity1 to take to the stage at @entity198 's @entity62 for his keynote speech , the @entity195 flashed an alert on television screens across the nation announcing : ' coming up : @entity190 speech '			0
the error will not have impressed @entity1 who has had a famously fractious relationship with his brother since he became @entity206			0
a screen grab of the mistake was quickly tweeted following the blunder at 11.29am whoops : the @entity57 made a mistake this morning when it said that @entity190 's speech was coming up - instead of @entity1 's vowed to cap train fare rises to apply to ever fare - not just less busy routes he said pensioners over 75 should be put on the cheapest energy tariff outlined a commitment to giving government contracts to firms that offer apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment and short - termism in business investment he is also looking at plans for a @entity2 @entity224 to help small businesses invest and grow			1
he wants workers to sit on corporate remuneration committees says he is in favour of people moving up council waiting lists if they contribute to their communities and are good neighbours .			0

insists he is not a ' c * * p leader following criticism from his former policy guru
vowed to cap train fare rises to apply to ever fare - not just less busy routes
he said pensioners over 75 should be put on the cheapest energy tariff
mr @entity1 said if @entity11 won the election again the party would be different
