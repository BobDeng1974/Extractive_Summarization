@entity0 ' was annoyed to start with , but was very understanding ' by @entity1 published : 06:27 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 29 july 2013 a mother - of - two miraculously found her engagement and wedding rings two days after losing them on a crowded beach			1
@entity7 thought she had seen the last of her wedding and engagement rings after she left them on packed @entity11 , one of the largest beaches on the @entity14 in @entity15			1
however , she made a desperate plea on @entity17 for a metal detector and returned to search for her missing jewellery			1
@entity7 , from @entity20 , in @entity15 , took off the rings before putting sun cream on her children @entity24 , three , and @entity25 , one , and then forgot all about them			1
@entity27 : @entity7 with her wedding and engagement rings which were lost on the beach near @entity29 , @entity15 and then found two days later using a metal detector @entity7 , who married @entity32 sailor @entity0 five years ago , said she put the rings - which were worth Â£ 3000 in total - in the inside pocket of a beach tent			1
' unfortunately i then became distracted by my daughter - and ice creams - and completely forgot to put my rings back on			2
she now believes the rings went flying when she shook the sand out of the beach tent			2
' i did n't realise i was n't wearing them until about four hours later back at the caravan park where some friends were staying			0
' @entity27 : @entity7 , who married @entity32 sailor @entity0 five years ago , said the rings she lost on the beach were particularly meaningful			1
she helped to design her engagement ring , and a friend made the wedding band she rummaged through the car and the beach tent , but there was no sign of the rings so she drove back to the beach and spent 40 minutes searching in vain			1
' i had to tearfully return home to @entity20 and explain to my husband that i 'd lost them			2
' he was understandably irritated with me , ' she said			0
adding to her anguish was the fact the rings were particularly meaningful : @entity7 helped to design her engagement ring , and a friend made the wedding band			1
over the moon : the rings lay forgotten in the sand for two whole days and @entity7 could n't be happier when she saw them sticking out of the sand as a last - ditch effort , and without much hope , @entity7 and @entity0 put a post on @entity17 asking for the loan or hire of a metal detector			1
a @entity78 woman dropped off one and a hire company delivered a second detector			2
' i was unable to get back to the beach until the friday			2
by this time i was convinced i would n't find them but felt i had to do this for peace of mind			0
' thursday and friday were just awful in the house , thinking , " oh @entity90 , what am i going to do ? " on friday afternoon @entity7 , husband @entity0 and their children made the one - and - a - half - hour journey back to the @entity14			1
' i had a vague idea of where we were sitting , but when we arrived i thought , " oh @entity90 , it 's so much bigger than i remembered			0
" ' there were kids with buckets and spades throwing sand everywhere			0
' ' we found tent peg after tent peg			2
' then , suddenly , i looked to my left and saw my wedding ring sticking out of the sand			0
' i squealed and cried at the same time			0
' she said two other families joined in the hunt for her engagement ring , which she found after an hour of looking , and others wished them well			0
eventually @entity0 found the second ring just a couple of metres from the first			2
' @entity0 was annoyed to start with , but he was very understanding , ' @entity7 said			1
' he always loses things and i thought , " this is horrendous			0
i 'll never be able to say anything about that again "			0
' she added : ' it 's incredible really that they were there two days later			0
' anybody could have picked them up from the sand or the tide and waves could have swept them away or even totally buried them			0
' it 's a fantastic result			0
' determined : on friday afternoon she and husband @entity0 with their children made the one - and - a - half - hour journey back to the @entity136 of @entity15 's largest beaches - to look for them			1

@entity7 lost both rings on crowded beach while attending to children
returned two days later with metal detector - but found first band herself
@entity0 ' was annoyed to start with , but was very understanding '
