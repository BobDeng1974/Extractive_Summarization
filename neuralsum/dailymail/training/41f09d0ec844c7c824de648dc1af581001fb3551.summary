@entity0 is tipping bookies ’ favourite @entity2 to take advantage of @entity4 ’ absence and win the @entity6			1
the world no 6 celebrated his first - ever major triumph back in 2011 when he won the @entity6 at @entity9 and his form of late , despite his high - profile break - up with tennis ace @entity12 , has improved considerably			1
the 25 - year - old showed his strength and class to win the @entity16 at @entity17 last month and he shot six - under par to finish tied - 15th at the recent @entity19 down for @entity2 practising his swing ahead of the @entity6 prepared : @entity2 talks with his dad @entity21 at @entity22 as he builds up to the @entity6 starting on thursday chillaxed : @entity0 believes that @entity2 can storm the @entity23 open in the absence of @entity4 @entity2 will begin his quest for glory on thursday and friday alongside two fellow former @entity6 champions in @entity28 and good friend @entity29 , completing a field buoyed by the absence of former world no 1 @entity33 who remains sidelined with a back problem			1
and @entity0 believes the @entity36 native will be in contention for a third major success come sunday ’s final round			1
‘ @entity22 is a ball strikers course and he [ @entity2 ] being the best ball striker in the world has to start as favourite			1
‘ without @entity4 [ @entity33 ] there , @entity43 is the favourite and you ’d expect him to be right there			1
' who can say he ’s going to win because golf is one of these things			0
but @entity2 will be in contention			0
’ @entity43 has admitted he will be making some equipment changes to his bag this week , opting to put a three - iron in and go with a three - wedge system comprising of a pitch wedge , 54 and 59 degree clubs			2
and @entity0 , who was @entity2 ’s @entity59 - winning captain at @entity60 four years ago , has warned @entity22 will be a difficult beast to tame			1
absent : @entity4 will miss the even with a back injury @entity63 : @entity0 , @entity2 and their @entity65 team - mates celebrating their @entity59 win in 2010 ‘ the @entity6 is seen as the toughest to win			1
’ he said , speaking exclusively to @entity66 at @entity67 , venue for this year ’s @entity59 extravaganza , where he launched the @entity72 limited edition whiskey on monday			1
‘ @entity22 is very different this year			1
they ’ve cut back all of the rough - in fact , there ’s no rough at all really			0
‘ @entity77 and his team have been asked by the @entity79 to put @entity22 back to its original state			2
‘ so , on all of the greens , you may run off and there ’s no rough to stop it			2
instead of stopping short in the rough to give you a flop shot , the ball will now run 30 yards extra down a slope			0
‘ what is means is , you ’ve got all sorts of options			0
do you chip it ? do you putt it ? it ’s very difficult			0
if it ’s at all breezy it could be near impossible			0
‘ this is a real , real challenge and the greens are firm too			0
’ swinger : @entity2 hits his tee shot on the seventh hole during a practice round at @entity22 on tuesday balls : the @entity104 smiles on the practice range as he gears up for his tilt at the trophy @entity108 ended the 43 - year hoodoo of an @entity111 champion when he became the first since @entity113 in 1970 to win the @entity6 at @entity114 last year			1
@entity0 , 50 , reckons @entity115 has every chance of defending his title in @entity118 and claims it ’s all thanks to the benchmark set by @entity122			1
@entity122 won back - to - back @entity6 championships in 2007 and 2008 before landing the @entity16 in the same calendar year			1
and @entity0 said : ‘ @entity108 ’s chances of retaining are very high			1
‘ i think that @entity122 gave those types of players belief that , “ look , i can do this lads , i ’ve won three out of four majors ... and so can you ”			2
‘ i think it ’s helped @entity2 , it helped @entity29 and helped @entity108 in winning these major championships since			1
they all have a great opportunity again			0
' @entity2 , i think , is one of the favourites			0
but @entity108 is returning to form following his shoulder injury			2
‘ going back to a championship that you ’ve won , albeit at a different venue , as a defending champion you feel you ’ve got a chance to do it again			1
and , obviously , @entity108 is up there with the favourites to win			2
’ @entity148 : @entity115 points to the sky after his final putt of his @entity23 @entity152 triumph last year throwback : he was the first @entity111 to do so since @entity113 in 1970 @entity0 , who will be summarising the play for @entity155 in @entity118 this week , is refusing to rule out the heavyweight @entity23 stars though			1
‘ who could discount @entity159 ? ’ he added			2
‘ you never know what ’s going to happen			0
he could just blast it round there and get away with it			0
‘ and then there ’s @entity166			0
we ’d all love for him to finally win the @entity6			2
six times runner - up in the one event he ’s not won			2
‘ this time he ’s playing a course that could suit him , especially with the short game wizardry that he has			0
‘ there ’s a number of guys potentially who could win it really			2
’ so , what about the chances of a @entity182 success in the @entity183 on sunday ? ‘ well , i like the look of @entity186 right now , ’ he said			0
‘ it would be great if he gets in the @entity59 team at @entity189 for @entity182 ’s sake			2
he ’s hitting the ball extremely well			0
’ diamond in the rough : two - times @entity159 champion @entity159 is a contender for his first @entity6 haunted : as is @entity166 , who has come second six times in the event without ever winning it perhaps @entity186 will take inspiration from @entity0 in his pursuit of a first ever major			1
@entity0 , after all , was the last @entity198 to return home victorious from across the @entity200 after his stunning @entity202 victory at @entity203 last month			0
‘ it was wonderful , ’ said @entity0			1
if you lead going into the last round and shoot a 65 you ’d be unlucky not to lose really			0
‘ but at the same time , it was great to win in @entity23			0
it has been a long time coming and i ’m thrilled			0
‘ i guess it was a relief more than anything			0
22 years i ’ve been playing in @entity23 , playing in a 130 - odd tournaments , so it was nice to finally win a stroke play event ! ’ plug : @entity0 poses at @entity67 at a @entity216 publicity event			1
