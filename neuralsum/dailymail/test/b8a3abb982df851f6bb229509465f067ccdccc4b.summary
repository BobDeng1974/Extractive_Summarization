@entity0 and lead singer of the band @entity3 @entity2 have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates in response to allegations of mistreatment at a @entity11 prison			1
‘ transgender women in male prisons have an equal right to protection from violence and abuse in prison , and yet they continue to face horrific injustices , ’ according to a joint statement the musicians released tuesday			1
last week , the @entity22 said prison officials must treat an inmate ’s gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition following a february lawsuit from the @entity28 filed against @entity30 officials on behalf of @entity31 , a transgender woman			1
allies : @entity0 and lead singer of @entity3 @entity2 have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates prison officials must treat an inmate 's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition , according to a @entity22 ruling in the case of transgender inmate @entity31 according to the lawsuit , prison officials did not provide sufficient treatment for 36 - year - old @entity31 ’s gender dysphoria - a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity			1
the lawsuit also said @entity31 was without hormone treatment for three years and her body suffered as a result , and that she had been sexually assaulted and ridiculed in prison			1
‘ more often than not , assaults in part go unreported because the perpetrators are prison guards , wardens and staff , ’ said @entity2 and @entity0 , who founded the @entity55			1
‘ this is outrageous , and the message it sends is horrific : that violence against and discrimination of trans people is not only allowed , but sanctioned			2
’ both @entity0 , 68 , and @entity2 , 55 , are openly gay			1
the frontman of @entity3 is a long - time supporter of the @entity70 singer ’s foundation			0
in their statement , @entity0 and @entity2 applauded the @entity22 for coming out in support of ms @entity31 and for challenging the constitutionality of @entity11 ’s policy of denying transgender inmates hormone treatments			1
but the musicians argued that more steps must be taken to end the ‘ culture of violence and discrimination			0
’ ‘ we urge the state of @entity11 to embrace desperately needed changes to their correctional system , ’ the statement concluded			0
last week , a judge ordered @entity88 ’s corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex - reassignment surgery			0
it was the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state			0
a photo of diamond compared to her @entity30 mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment the @entity22 filed a brief in @entity101 's case last friday saying it 's not taking a position on the accuracy of @entity31 's claims , but reminding prison officials that the @entity106 of the @entity107 requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition			1
@entity30 spokeswoman @entity112 wrote in an email that the agency does n't comment on pending litigation			2
while similar cases have been brought in other courts , @entity22 officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases			0
that action signals this administration 's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case , said @entity135 law professor @entity134			0
' if @entity11 disagrees , that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government , ' he said			0
' it 's a kind of shot across the bow			0
' diamond has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17 , the @entity28 lawsuit says			2
@entity31 says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars that gave her full breasts , a feminine shape , softer skin and a feminine appearance			2
only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under @entity30 policy , but the personnel who do those screenings often are n't familiar with the condition , the lawsuit says			1
despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy , @entity31 was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and was n't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted , the lawsuit says			2
though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary , department officials refused to authorize the treatment , the lawsuit says			0
so - called freeze - frame policies , that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who were n't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional , the @entity22 brief says			0
such policies violate the @entity106 prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment			0
without the hormone treatment for the past three years , @entity31 's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish , the lawsuit says			2
she has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she has n't been offered safe accommodation , the lawsuit says			2
@entity31 , 36 , identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 @entity28 staff attorney @entity203 said in an emailed statement friday that the @entity22 brief bolsters their arguments			1
' transgender inmates like @entity31 have a right to proper medical care , ' @entity203 said			1
' they have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the @entity107			1
' other courts have ordered hormones , psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates			1
a federal judge on thursday ordered @entity88 's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex - reassignment surgery , the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state			0
it was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery , said @entity234 , legal director at the @entity235 in @entity236			0
the previous order in a @entity239 case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the @entity241 @entity240 .			0
