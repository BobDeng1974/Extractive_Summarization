by @entity0 music really is the food of love , scientists have found			2
a woman 's musical taste changes when she is at her most fertile , making her more responsive to men who are able to produce more complex music			0
the study , carried out at the @entity11 , suggest that women only preferred better musicians as short - term lovers - not as long - term partners			1
study : scientists have found that a woman 's musical taste changes when she is at her most fertile , making her more responsive to men who are able to produce more complex music the research support naturalist @entity22 's theory that music 's primary function is in sexual courtship			1
the study , published today by the @entity27 , might suggest why creative individuals are considered so desirable for short - term sexual relationships			1
@entity30 , the paper 's author , said : ' the findings of this study provide the first support for @entity22 's original contention that music evolved via sexual selection			1
' these results suggest that women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners			2
' results : the research support naturalist @entity22 's theory that music 's primary function is in sexual courtship dr @entity30 's study of nearly 1,500 women , with an average age of 28 years , who were not breastfeeding , pregnant or using hormonal contraception , involved two experiments			1
women were asked to choose which of four thematically similar piano compositions , played by music software , was the most complex			0
the melodies progressed from a few chords and a simple rhythm to a greater variety of chords and a syncopated , off - beat rhythm			0
another group of women were asked whether they would prefer the composer of the first simple or second more complex melody , either as a short - term sexual partner , or a longer - term partner in a committed relationship			1
nature : @entity22 argued that birdsong and human music , having no other clear role in survival , must have had a role in sexual selection the results showed that women only preferred composers of more complex music as short - term sexual partners at the point in their menstrual cycle when the chance of conception was at its highest			1
no preference was shown when women chose which composer they would prefer as a long - term partner in a committed relationship , the results revealed			1
the role of music in human evolution has long been a mystery to scientists			0
@entity22 argued that birdsong and human music , having no other clear role in survival , must have had a role in sexual selection			2
whereas the role of music in the natural world has been accepted by zoologists , this is the first study that supports @entity22 's views of music in human reproduction			1
dr @entity30 said : ' the ability to create complex music could be indicative of advanced cognitive abilities			0
' consequently , women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners			2
' he said : ' i suggest that music may have manifested itself in courtship contexts by allowing both men and women to display specific adaptive qualities			2
' for instance , the ability to play an instrument could reflect excellent physical condition and learning capacity			0
' men and women may also have sung to each other to show how they can improvise novel melodies and perhaps display their creativity and ability to innovate			0
' but he added : ' because women did not prefer composers of more complex music as long - term partners , however , it appears that the ability to produce complex musical sounds does not reflect skills valued in long - term mates , ie. increased ability to acquire material benefits such as food and shelter			1
' success : a separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an ivf lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent a separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an ivf lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent			0
researchers from the @entity166 fertility clinic in @entity167 said the tiny vibrations produced by the music helped fertilisation			0
pop , classical and heavy metal tracks were all equally good , the scientists found .			0

study suggests women prefer better musicians as short - term lovers
@entity11 scientists say findings support @entity22 's theories
@entity185 may suggest why creative individuals are considered desirable
