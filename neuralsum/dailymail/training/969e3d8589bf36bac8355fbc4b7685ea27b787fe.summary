by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 5 january 2013 throwing down the gauntlet : @entity2 slams @entity3 as a washed - up has - been who has n't been funny in 20 years			1
oh , and he also called him a sell - out late - night upstart @entity2 may have them rolling in the aisles during show , ' @entity9 ' but the @entity11 funnyman reserved his most biting barbs for @entity3 , recently repudiating the ' @entity14 's ' hoary - haired humorist as a has - been , or , ' a master chef who opened a @entity16			1
' ' @entity3 has n’t been a good stand - up in 20 years , ' @entity2 said in a new @entity19 cover - story , an advanced copy of which the @entity21 obtained			1
' as a comedian , you ca n’t not have disdain for what he ’s done : he totally sold out			2
' @entity2 , who was apparently smoked copious ganja with the @entity19 scribe during his stoned - out tet - e - tet with the magazine , was more complimentary of @entity32 , his childhood idol			1
' if i beat @entity32 in the ratings , does that mean i ’m better than @entity32 ? no f * * * ing way , ' he said			0
@entity2 also praised @entity3 ’s @entity39 colleague , @entity38 , who hosts ' @entity40 with @entity38			1
' i like it because he ’s a very worthy competitor			0
' @entity2 's acerbic assaults on @entity3 - which lent the @entity19 interview the same air as a hyped prizefight 's weigh - in - come only days before he moves his show from midnight to the coveted 11:35pm et slot , where it will directly compete in the ratings with @entity3 's ' @entity14 ' specifically , the sallies concerning @entity3 were offered mostly in reply to the @entity19 scribe 's question concerning the quality of @entity3 's recent sets at @entity51 's ' @entity85 club			1
' however , @entity2 apparently did n't need an excuse to let fly on the established funnyman			0
having long held @entity3 in contempt , @entity2 recently compared him to a weapon - wielding zombie who just wo n't die			1
here 's the dope : @entity2 was apparently smoking dope with the @entity19 scribe when he blitzed @entity3 in the magazine ' @entity3 is not going to be able to stay on television forever , and obviously @entity38 is the heir apparent , ' @entity2 reportedly said			1
' and [ @entity98 is ] doing a great job , so it makes sense people would talk like this			0
that said , you can never count @entity3 out			0
he seems to pop up just when you think he 's dead -- he comes alive and he 's got a hatchet			0
' @entity3 has n’t been a good stand - up in 20 years			2
as a comedian , you ca n’t not have disdain for what he ’s done : he totally sold out			2
according to @entity111 , @entity112 in 2010 offered audiences an unflattering impersonation of @entity3 on his show			0
he also chastised @entity3 for planning a return to ' @entity14 ' after @entity117 was forced out as the show 's host the same year			1
and last year , at a @entity121 event , @entity2 said of @entity3 , “ f * * * him			2
” the issue of @entity19 featuring @entity2 hits newsstands friday			0
@entity3 has taken some hits of late from other comedy corners			0
none other than @entity32 recently weighed in , paying him a very backhanded compliment during a televised interview with @entity127			0
' i will say , and i 'm happy to say , that i think he is the funniest guy i 've ever known , ' @entity32 reportedly said of @entity3			2
' just flat out , if you go see him do his nightclub act , just the funniest , the smartest , a wonderful observationist and very appealing as a comic			0
therefore , the fact that he is also maybe the most insecure person i have ever known - i could never reconcile that			1

during a *reefer* - laced interview , @entity2 said of @entity3 : ' he totally sold out '
stoned sallies come as @entity2 moves his show to 11.35pm , or the same time as @entity3 's ' @entity14 '
praises @entity32 and @entity38 , the latter of which he called a worthy *foe*
attacks come on heels of @entity32 referring to @entity3 as ' the most insecure person i have ever known '
