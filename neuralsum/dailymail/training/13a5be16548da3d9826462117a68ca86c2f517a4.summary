by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:34 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 14:52 est , 3 march 2014 the co-founders of popular instant messaging service @entity4 have become a last - minute addition to this year 's list of global billionaires			1
@entity9 and @entity10 made @entity12 ' annual rich list in february after @entity13 offered a total of $ 19 billion to buy their company			1
the deal gives @entity9 a fortune of $ 6.8 billion , while partner @entity10 is said to be worth at least $ 3 billion according to @entity12			1
late addition : @entity19 founders @entity10 , left , and @entity9 , right , made this year 's list of global billionaires following an acquisition offer from @entity13 in february			1
@entity13 offered the pair $ 19 billion for the service , but the founders are set to get a total of $ 9.8 billion between them however , neither made the top twenty list , which was topped by @entity29 founder @entity28 with his $ 76 million fortune			1
this year 's list had the largest number of female billionaires ever , including : @entity34 is arguably the most famous of the 34 women who are new to the list this year , and she just made the cut with $ 1.05billion after @entity13 's share price increased dramatically			1
@entity40 fashion head turned oil magnate @entity41 who is worth $ 2.5billion			1
@entity43 from the @entity44 who made her $ 1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site @entity47			0
@entity49 's granddaughters @entity50 and @entity51 have been added to the list			2
@entity53 , the daughter of @entity55 owner @entity54 , made the list after inheriting her mother 's wealth following her death in august			2
other new faces on the 28th annual list : @entity9 from @entity4 , $ 6.8billion @entity10 from @entity4 , $ 3billion @entity62 from @entity63 , $ 3billion @entity64 of @entity65 , $ 1.8billion @entity66 owns the @entity68 shoe company that produces @entity70 flip flops , $ 1.5billion @entity71 , the ceo of tech company @entity72 , $ 1.2billion @entity73 from @entity74 , $ 1.2billion @entity13 founder @entity75 made the most money in the world over the past 12 months , according to the @entity12 report , and his net worth nearly doubled , going from 2013 's estimate of $ 15.2billion to $ 28.5billion as a result of the social network 's increasing share price			1
@entity9 and @entity84 are among a list of 26 newcomers to the annual list , alongside @entity63 's @entity62 who has a fortune of $ 3billion			1
@entity71 , the ceo of tech company @entity72 who made $ 1.2billion , and @entity66 who amassed a fortune of $ 1.5 billion with his @entity68 shoe company that makes @entity70 flip flops also made the cut for the first time			2
@entity28 held the title of ' richest man in the world ' for 15 out of the past 20 years , but he was succeeded - briefly - by @entity99 telecommunications magnate @entity97 for the past four years			1
@entity28 , who now spends most of his time in philanthropy , earned his spot back as his net worth increased by $ 9billion to $ 76billion after @entity29 's stock had a promising year , putting him ahead of @entity97 who came in at $ 72billion			1
@entity55 owner @entity54 held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor @entity106 and @entity109 head @entity108 came in fifth place			0
the rest of the top ten show the power of @entity115 family connections , as sixth and seventh place went to @entity117 and @entity118 respectively			0
casino magnate @entity119 came in eighth place , followed by @entity123 heirs - with @entity124 and family coming in ninth and her brother - in - law @entity127 came in 10th			0
their relatives @entity130 and @entity131 also got their own spots on the list , meaning that the @entity127 family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world			1
@entity124 's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the richest woman in the world , but that does n't mean there was n't a great deal of change for women on this year 's list			1
back at the top : @entity28 was the ' richest man in the world ' for 15 out of the past 20 years but was dethroned briefly by @entity99 telecommunications magnate @entity97 up until now wealthy old men : two top ten honorees are octogenarians , as @entity106 ( left ) is 83 - years - old and @entity119 ( right ) is 80 - years - old going up : @entity75 's net worth nearly doubled to $ 28.5billion since @entity13 's share price is now up 130 per cent over the past year more women than ever were included this year , with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645			1
that jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year , as only 138 women were on the list in 2013			1
one of the new female faces was that of @entity34 who is one of the youngest self - made billionaires with a net worth of $ 1.05billion			1
like @entity75 , she was helped dramatically by the fact that the @entity13 share price is now up 130 per cent			1
though the new wave of wealthy technology leaders made their presence known on this year 's list , neither of the @entity13 faces were in the top 20 with @entity75 just narrowly missing the cut off			1
@entity173 of tech : @entity176 co-founders @entity177 , left , and @entity178 , right , came in 17th and 19th with $ 32.3billion and $ 31.8billion respectively earning her spot : @entity13 coo @entity34 , 44 , is one of the youngest self - made billionaire women and a new entry onto this year 's list gates clearly led the way with @entity108 not far behind , younger iterations like @entity176 's @entity177 and @entity178 came in 17th and 19th place respectively			1
they were interrupted along the way by @entity189 's @entity188 , who came in 18th place with $ 32billion			2
aside from @entity34 , another first time mention was given to designer @entity192 , whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he took his eponymous company public in 2011			1
though he is near the bottom of the list , retail giants were represented well in the top 20			2
between @entity54 , @entity201 's @entity200 , and @entity203 's @entity202 and the four @entity127 relatives , there were seven retail billionaires in the top 20			2
by comparison , there were only six tech billionaires in the same subset , including @entity28 , @entity108 and former @entity211 mayor @entity210			2
@entity28 , $ 76billion 2			2
@entity97 , $ 72billion 3			2
@entity54 , $ 64billion 4			0
