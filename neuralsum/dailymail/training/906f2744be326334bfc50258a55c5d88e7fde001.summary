however , @entity2 will return to the squad for the trip to @entity32 on @entity33 , and the @entity4 boss explained why he is nursing the player back to full fitness			1
@entity0 said : ' he is a special boy that we need to take more care of , more than a lot of the others because he has been out for a long time			1
' he has been out for 550 days in the last four years , which is almost two years , so you need to take it slowly and build it up again			0
' now he has been injury - free for two months			1
he got this little one ( injury ) but it is nothing serious			2
so this is going very well			0
@entity2 ( right ) scores at @entity20 ' if you push him too hard then he is going to be out again			1
against @entity26 he was more active than he was before but you need consistency over time to get the best out of @entity2			1
' the problem has been pulled muscles so we need to get his fitness up			0
' it is one thing is to run , another to play football			0
you get football fitness by getting on the pitch			0
' but he is in a good place now			0
he played 90 minutes against @entity26 and i think you have to go back a long time for his last 90 minutes			2
' we want quick steps but we have to be careful			0
' the 23 - year - old ( right ) suffered his most - recent injury in the loss to @entity26 on december 21 the loss of five points in @entity4 's last two games meant @entity77 were able to move to within two points of the champions with their 1 - 0 win at @entity81 on sunday			1

@entity0 denied that his side go into 2015 in poor form but admits ' stupid ' points lost early in the season have hampered title aspirations			2

in the last 10 ( league ) games we have had eight victories and one defeat and one draw			2
@entity2 runs off in celebration after scoring against @entity12 at @entity20 in september 2011 ' and we have should have taken something out of the game in which we got beat			2
' in the last two games we have n't taken the points we wanted but we are controlling games			0
' @entity77 are on a good run and they are a good team but we have to concentrate on ourselves and continue winning games and then the other team has to be very good to cope with us			0
' i had hoped for more points			0
we lost some stupid points at the beginning of the season , but in the last weeks we have been quite consistent and we are controlling games more than we did before			0
