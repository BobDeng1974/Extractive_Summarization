@entity0 caused one or two raised eyebrows when he urged @entity4 ’s @entity3 captain @entity2 to end any uncertainty regarding @entity7 ’s place in the team by picking him straight away			1
not least from the man who made @entity0 vice-captain			2
‘ yeah , i saw that , ’ said @entity2 , chuckling to himself			1
‘ that might be @entity0 ’s view but it ’s certainly not mine			2
’ @entity0 was on safer ground when he mentioned @entity16 for similar treatment , while @entity18 , if necessary , will definitely get one of the three wild cards as well			1
big call : @entity2 is not afraid to leave out @entity7 for @entity3 but @entity7 , whose struggles continued with a missed cut at the @entity24 , is one of a host of players @entity2 will be keeping a close eye on as thoughts turn to the 143rd @entity29 at @entity30 next week			1
@entity2 said : ‘ we all know @entity7 has the pedigree			1
if you look back at the @entity3 since 1997 , he has been the one constant pillar of all our success during that time			1
i ’m a huge fan , and i ’m certainly not looking to rip up the template			2
but i have to justify every decision i make , so he has to show me some form			2
‘ i spoke with @entity39 ( @entity40 , @entity7 ’s manager ) last week and spelled it out			1
we ’ve got three huge events coming up that will determine the final line - up and the truth is @entity7 needs to do something			1
’ @entity18 and @entity16 are in a different category			1
‘ they ’ve got the pedigree and they ’re in good form , ’ argued the @entity47			0
@entity52 is one place outside the team and @entity55 ’s just won the @entity56			2
so i ’m not going to try to kid anybody			0
if either of them end up needing a pick , they ’ve got a very good chance of getting one			0
’ it never does any harm to have one or two current major winners in the team and @entity2 is confident a @entity4 can pull off an @entity24 victory on the @entity70			1
he said : ‘ i ’m very interested to see how they get on , because i think our chances of coming up with a winner have gone up considerably with so many of our top guys competing in the @entity24			0
‘ i could never understand why you would come straight from @entity77 to play links golf			0
would @entity80 or @entity81 go straight from playing on clay to @entity83 without a warm - up event on grass ? ‘ i ’m a big fan of seeing a major like a big exam , and you have to prepare			0
going from @entity77 golf to links golf , to me , is like studying @entity91 for a maths exam			0
so let ’s see how they fare at @entity95			0
’ before competing in the @entity24 , @entity2 was at @entity96 last week overseeing a junior camp run by one of his sponsors , @entity100			1
his passion for the project was obvious			0
during a clinic he talked about his own career , in which he contributed fully to three @entity3 victories			1
‘ i ’ve been a pro for 22 years and i would do things a lot differently if i had my time again , ’ he told the audience			0
focused : @entity4 captain @entity2 will be keeping a close eye on a host of players he held up a golf club and likened it to a tree			1
‘ if you think climbing that tree is like getting to the top in golf , the idea should be to get there as quickly as possible , ’ he explained			0
‘ but there are so many distractions which i regard as branches , like schedule and swing thoughts , and i ended up going sideways along too many branches			0
‘ i would hold up @entity127 as the perfect role model in this regard			0
he did n’t worry about swing changes , or getting too fit			0
he just concentrated on what would get him to the top			0
’ @entity2 has watched the recent victories for @entity4 ’s heavy hitters with mixed feelings			1
‘ do n’t get me wrong , it was great to see wins for @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity55 , and the team is shaping up really nicely , ’ he said			2
‘ but it was like this in 2012 , when you could n’t pick up a paper on a sunday night without reading about yet another @entity4 victory			1
‘ and what happened when we got to @entity148 ? we got outplayed for most of the contest and got lucky when @entity52 changed the outcome almost single - handedly with his performance on saturday night when he birdied the last five holes			0
‘ i ’m a great lover of boxing and we were on the ropes in the 11th round when we lashed out and caught our opponent , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ if @entity52 had n’t done what he did on the saturday we ’d have probably lost by about four or five points			0
in the doldrums : @entity7 missed the cut at the @entity24 in @entity161 good form : @entity91 's @entity18 will be one of the captain 's picks if required ‘ so i ’m using that as a real motivating factor			1
we ’ve won the last two @entity167 but how many sessions have we actually won ? ( the answer is two out of nine )			0
so the @entity171 luck has to change			0
i just hope it ’s not on my watch			0
’ whenever talk turns to @entity29 right now , @entity16 ’s name invariably crops up			1
he was the first - round leader at @entity95 last time and is heading to a course that plays to his strengths with his recent @entity178 win under his belt			0
‘ if you look back at @entity55 ’s record , he invariably follows one victory with another soon after , and @entity95 looks perfect for him , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but i ’m reluctant to single out @entity4 who i think will do well			1
few players react well when they ’re under that kind of pressure and i do n’t want to heap any on his shoulders			0
’ three big events to go and @entity2 reckons @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity138 and @entity137 are booted and suited			2
@entity194 , @entity16 and @entity18 are all guaranteed places , one way or the other			1
so that leaves three places up for grabs			2
could the stakes be any higher , therefore , heading to @entity30 ? not only a @entity202 to play for but a @entity3 place as well			2
one thing ’s for sure : @entity2 will be watching			2
l @entity205 ambassador @entity2 was mentoring young golfers from across the world at @entity208			2

@entity2 will be keeping close eye on @entity7 at @entity29
@entity16 and @entity18 will definitely be picked for @entity3
three places are still up for grabs in @entity4 team
