historic @entity1 events such as the triple jump and swimming races are in the line of fire after new rules were agreed by the @entity7 to allow more sports into future games			1
the @entity7 will give greater flexibility to the @entity1 programme to allow host cities to stage new sports - there have been calls to bring in sports such as surfing that have greater appeal to young people			1
it could also pave the way to baseball / softball and possibly squash and karate being included in the @entity9			0
however , the number of athletes will be capped at 10,500 meaning that there will be pressure on the bigger sports such as track and field and swimming to agree to a cut in the number of events			0
@entity36 could be one of the sports which could be cut for @entity39 - @entity40 represented @entity41 at the @entity42 @entity44 's @entity7 member @entity43 believes synchronised swimming should also be chopped @entity44 's @entity7 member @entity43 identified triple jump , synchronised swimming and race - walking as events he believes should be dropped from the @entity9			1
@entity50 , head of the @entity51 and @entity53 vice-president , hit back saying : ' triple jump is a sacrosanct sport in track and field			1
' lord @entity50 also defended race - walking but conceded there will now be pressure on athletics , saying : ' there are roughly 10,500 athletes in an @entity1 and we take roughly 2,200 - a fifth of all competitors and 47 different disciplines			1
does that mean track and field needs to be vigilant about protecting its events then the answer is almost certainly " yes it will "			0
' other @entity7 members believe the situation with swimming , which allowed @entity76 to win eight gold medals in one games in 2008 , needs to be reformed			2
@entity79 , president of swimming 's international federation @entity80 , said : ' i do n't know what will happen , this is the truth , it 's a difficult moment			0
' i suppose that it 's a problem we discuss in the future , we do n't know what 's going to happen with us , athletics , gymnastics			0
' in other rule changes - part of the greatest shake - up in the @entity1 since 1999 - it was agreed that @entity9 will be able to staged in more than one city or even in different countries in the future			2
@entity44 's @entity7 member @entity98 has identified triple jump , synchronised swimming and race - walking as the sports which should be chopped @entity50 hit back at @entity98 by jumping to the defence of triple jump and race - walking the 127th @entity7 session meeting in @entity108 on monday passed recommendations on bidding for @entity9 despite concerns being expressed that the changes could damage the atmosphere of the @entity1			1
the new rules will also make it less costly for cities to bid to host games with the @entity7 picking up the bill for some of the costs			1
the rules were passed unanimously but there were some concerns expressed by @entity7 members about holding @entity1 in different cities or countries			1
@entity126 , the @entity127 @entity7 member who oversaw the preparations for @entity42 , said : ' i am worried that the unique character of the @entity9 could be diminished by the recommendation to allow some events to be dispersed over several locations within the same country , or even in a neighbouring country			1
' the @entity1 village wo n't look the same and for isolated athletes it will resemble more a kind of world championship without living a true @entity1 experience			2
' @entity7 vice-president @entity141 , who presented the changes to bidding rules , said holding events outside the host city or country would only be considered in ' exceptional circumstances '			1
meanwhile , suggestions that some summer events could be held during the winter olympics have been dismissed by the @entity7			2
@entity151 , the president of cycling 's governing body @entity152 , was among those calling for a radical overhaul of the @entity1 , with indoor sports such as track cycling , judo and badminton possibly moving to the @entity159			2
@entity160 will have to step down from his role at the @entity7 in 2016 due to new age limit restrictions the @entity7 also agreed to maintain an age limit of 70 for @entity7 members - with a few limited exceptions permitted			2
in february , @entity165 president @entity160 called the limit ' discrimination ' and the 78 - year - old now faces having to step down from the @entity7 in 2016 when he reaches the limit of 80 for members elected before 1999			0
@entity160 was in @entity108 but did not challenge the proposal on this occasion			0
speaking afterwards , @entity160 said he did not oppose the age limits this time as he had already made his point			0
' i am a team player , i am in the @entity7 team and i accept what was proposed , ' he said			0
asked why @entity165 had decided against age limits , @entity160 replied : ' in @entity165 we have another team			0
' it meant that all 40 proposals put forward as part of the @entity184 were voted for unanimously and @entity7 president @entity186 told a news conference this would go down as an historic day for the @entity1 movement			1
@entity186 said : ' not in my wildest dreams did i expect this to happen so easily			0
i hope in 20 years i can look back to this day with satisfaction and happiness and maybe with a little bit of relief			0

the @entity7 will give greater flexibility to the @entity1 programme
new rules will allow future @entity1 host cities to stage new sports
@entity7 member @entity43 has named sports which should be dropped
@entity50 responded to @entity98 by defending triple jump
