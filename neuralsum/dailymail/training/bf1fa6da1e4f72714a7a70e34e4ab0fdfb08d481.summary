by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 3 october 2013 a powerful solar flare directed at @entity3 has put on majestic display of the northern lights across parts of @entity7 , the @entity8 and @entity9			1
the explosion crashed into @entity3 's magnetic field on tuesday allowing people to see the light show as far south as @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
one lucky photographer managed to catch the aurora as it began			0
in one photograph , a young @entity21 man 's cart and horse is silhouetted against the luminescent green lights			2
this image shows a young @entity21 boy on his way to work at 4:30am looking at the light show on @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity15			0
the image was captured by 61 - year - old photographer @entity35 in other images pink and green clouds shimmer against a star - speckled skit above a darkened farm			2
the stunning photographs of the aurora borealis were captured by @entity35 hours before the natural light show was predicted to be visible			0
mr @entity35 , 61 , had been following a website that tracks the solar flares that create these light shows and alerts people when the aurora may be seen in the sky			1
the recent storm has subsided now , but it could flare up again			2
some forecasters a 50 per cent chance of more polar geomagnetic storms tonight the light show above an @entity54			1
the display was created by a powerful solar explosion crashed into @entity3 's magnetic field on tuesday allowing people to see the light show as far south as @entity14 and @entity16 mr @entity35 had been following a website that tracks the solar flares that create these light shows and alerts people when the aurora may be seen in the sky but the photographer from @entity67 , @entity15 , caught sight of the aurora that was scheduled for night time very early in the morning			1
‘ at around midnight i looked out of my window and saw the light show - it came sooner than i thought , ' he said			0
‘ auroras are unpredictable , but they are expected to show two and a half days after a solar flare			1
’ as he took photos in @entity34 , @entity15 , mr @entity35 spotted a young @entity21 man admiring the spectacle			0
the @entity79 was also seen in the skies near @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 this week with this image captured by @entity85 solar flares create auroras when radiation from the sun reaches @entity3 and interacts with charged protons in our atmosphere			1
the effects are greater at the magnetic poles and weaken as they move south from the @entity95 or north of the @entity96 mr @entity35 said : ‘ the @entity21 people get up very early to start work and young man had never seen the @entity100 before			2
‘ he was blown away by its natural beauty			0
we stood and shared the moment for a while			0
’ the @entity79 was also seen in the skies near @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 this week with images here captured by @entity85			2

' at around midnight i looked out of my window and saw the light show - it came sooner than i thought , ' said photographer @entity35 the intensity and frequency of @entity100 activity is governed by solar cycles that lasts for 11 years			2
@entity124 scientists recently predicted that the current period of solar activity will reach a new peak in december			1
on an official @entity124 video , @entity128 , the director of the @entity129 at @entity130 , said that by december there should be what is termed a ‘ solar flip ’			0
this is when the conditions for viewing the lights would be at their best			0
the recent storm has subsided now , but it could flare up again			0

solar flares create auroras when radiation from the sun reaches @entity3 and mixes with protons in our atmosphere
current storm has ended , but forecasters claim there is a 50 per cent chance of more geomagnetic activity tonight
