she said : ' it was a nightmare			0
my daughter @entity22 had some friends round and one of her mates had plugged in her e-cigarette and they 'd gone out playing			2
' about 15 minutes later , i was doing housework and i heard this crackling noise coming from @entity22 's bedroom			1
' i did n't know what it was and when i reached the landing i just remember this huge bang and i was thrown to the floor by the force of it			2
' it had been left on the floor and the explosion sent it flying across the room and it ended up under @entity22 's bed			2
horror : just a few of their possessions escaped the blaze , which fire fighters said the family was lucky to survive escape : ms @entity7 grabbed @entity33 , four , as she fled the house after hearing an enormous bang upstairs @entity70 : even the floorboards have given way after flames crashed through the windows and ceilings ' i was crawling around and when i looked i could n't believe my eyes			1
there was smoke everywhere and the room was on fire			0
' the force of the blast had blown out all the bedroom windows and blown the door off the hinges			2
' i could n't breathe and my instinct was just to grab @entity33 and get out			0
' ms @entity7 says her two daughters were in the front garden playing when she ran outside covered in soot carrying her four - year - old son			1
her neighbours ' cat @entity91 , who was in the house at the time , sadly died in the blaze			1
ms @entity7 said : ' my first thought was to make sure my kids were safe			1
lucky : the devastated family described the incident as a nightmare , the children could n't stop screaming battered : the house looks almost unrecognisable after the device shot out of its plug and exploded ' my son was screaming and when my girls saw us run outside they heard me shouting ' fire ' and they burst into tears too			1
' i thought the cat was in the house so i left @entity33 outside and i ran back in but i could n't see or breathe because there was so much smoke			1
' it 's awful that @entity91 died but i 'm grateful it was n't my kids			1
it could have been so much worse			0
' ms @entity7 added : ' @entity22 's bedroom was covered in flames and she 's lost everything and the smoke spread to the rest of the house			1
devastated : @entity124 , 10 , and his sister @entity125 , six , are mourning the death of @entity91 ( pictured ) after a fire started by an e-cigarette which exploded in their neighbours house while it was charging ' everything is covered in black soot and the roof is destroyed too			1
we ca n't even enter our house because it 's not safe so we do n't have any of our belongings			1
' i 'm staying with my partner and @entity33 and the girls are staying with their dad , otherwise we 'd be homeless			2
' she hopes the ordeal will act as a warning to others			0
@entity91 's devastated owner @entity145 , 42 , said : ' we ’re all heartbroken			1
' the kids are absolutely devastated			0
@entity125 , our daughter , cried herself to sleep on saturday night			0
' @entity91 was just a really good cat , really friendly			1
everybody on the street loved him and bought him toys			0
the majority of explosions and fatalities caused by e-cigarettes is down to people using the wrong chargers , fire crews warn			2
though they have a usb connection , they need to be charged using specific e-cig chargers , not be plugged into laptops or @entity167 chargers , which cause them to overheat			0
many people also over-tighten the screwed connection , which damages the battery cells , creating heat			0
and while mobile phones can be left charging for an extensive period of time , the batteries in e-cigarettes do not have in - built protection to prevent overheating			1
therefore , if left too long , the lithium - ion battery will combust and explode			2
' we buried the cat yesterday in the front garden			0
our other cat sparkle spent four hours sitting on top of the grave			0
' blasting the new tobacco - free trend , mr @entity124 urged for companies to do more to prevent fatalities			2
he said : ' these e-cigarettes come from all over the world			0
' you never really know if they ’re safe			0
something needs to be done about it			0
' e-cigarettes are used by more than two million @entity199 – three times the number in 2012			2
last year , @entity201 , 68 , died as a result of a blaze apparently started by the battery of her device			1
it is the only fatality linked to e-cigarettes , but there have been a number of close calls			0
last month a hotel barmaid was engulfed in flame when one exploded as it was being charged with an @entity217 charger			0
a pensioner was also badly burned when her e-cigarette ignited her oxygen supply			0
and in @entity223 , a woman ’s car was set on fire when her e-cigarette exploded as it was being charged in the vehicle ’s auxiliary socket			2
loyal : the @entity124 family paid tribute to their moggie and called for tighter safety regulations on e-cigarettes @entity234 , chairman of @entity235 , added : ' the family had a lucky escape with discovering the fire when they did , although their house is damaged and they have lost their pet			1
' please can we remind people to take extra care when it comes to electrical items , not leaving them plugged in too long and making sure wires , plugs and chargers are in good working order			0
' the use of e-cigarettes is also the source of controversy			0
last week , the @entity257 called for e-cigarettes to be banned in public places and claimed they are just as dangerous as smoking .			0
