@entity2 's @entity1 dream died on sunday with striker @entity3 pointing the finger of blame squarely at the officials after his side 's shock @entity9 semi-final defeat by @entity12			1
a blatant @entity14 handball in the box was missed by referee @entity16 and his team , particularly assistant @entity18 , at the end of the first half with the @entity22 club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card			1
a goal down at the time , @entity12 fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the @entity2 players could do little to hide their fury after the match			1
@entity2 striker @entity3 has a shot at goal during the @entity9 semi-final against @entity12 @entity3 heads the ball , which is deflected clearly off the hand of @entity12 ' @entity14 ( left ) on sunday despite numerous appeals , no penalty or red card was given for @entity14 ' handball and @entity12 won ' we have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room — we 've been robbed , ' said @entity3 who , more than an hour after the final whistle , was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger			1
' it was very disappointing			2
we had a chance to go and make history			2
we did n't get the result in the end			2
' @entity2 were a @entity56 goal to the good at the time of the @entity14 incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as @entity2 goalkeeper @entity63 was sent off for a foul on @entity65			1
@entity66 equalised with the resultant spot - kick and suddenly @entity69 ' men were in ascendancy			2
with the teams level at full - time , @entity71 and @entity72 swapped goals in extra-time before @entity77 grabbed a 117th - minute winner — leaving the @entity79 jubilant and their opponents distraught			1
@entity22 manager @entity81 had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident			2
@entity84 , meanwhile , stalked past with a face like thunder , lightning and @entity89 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass , damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium			0
' i have asked the centre - half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent , so in my book that 's a penalty and a red card , ' continued @entity3			1
' we have probably the best penalty taker in the league in @entity108 , who i am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2 - 0 up			1
they 'd have been down to 10 men and it would have been a mountain for them to come back			0
@entity2 's @entity114 ( centre ) is challenged by @entity65 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) on sunday @entity2 captain @entity84 ( left ) has words with referee @entity16 during the @entity9 semi-final ' i knew it was a penalty			1
i think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty			2
the second half has been very lucky			0
' he is the one who said it hit him in the face ( the additional assistant ref )			0
i asked the ref why he did n't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face			2
i do n't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty			2
' he said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing i can do about that now			0
it is a game - changing decision			1
' when you have officials behind the goals , they need to be doing their job			2
if he thinks that 's him in on the face ... ? ' i do n't really want to say too much about the officials because i 'll end up in trouble			1
but it 's a massive , massive decision and it 's cost us the game			1
' everybody was so content that we were going to win the league , we already have a trophy ( the @entity160 ) in the bag			0
everyone was saying the @entity9 was practically a given			1
but we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it 's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done			1
' @entity3 attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the @entity9 semi-final on sunday against @entity12 as much as @entity3 was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another @entity176 semi-final goal , the former @entity172 star felt for manager @entity81 , a man who has been so open about his desire to win a @entity1 – and his belief in this team 's ability to do so			1
@entity2 had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed , backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done , whatever obstacles they might have to overcome			1
' i think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone , ' said the @entity3			1
' he 'd only have been the third @entity2 manager to have won a @entity1			1
' he would have made history and as players we would have become legends			2
but it ' s difficult to do that			0
i said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a @entity1 , the games get harder			0
@entity12 stood in our way and did a job			1
' now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season			0
we have a massive game at @entity208 on wednesday			0
@entity209 will be up for it , we 've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final			0
we have three days and then we have to play @entity209 at a difficult venue			0
but we need three points			0
' this will fire us up			0
we are n't far away from clinching the league now			0
we have two hard games in the next week at @entity208 and @entity217			0
if we go there and pick up three points from each , we will be in a real good position			0
' from @entity1 to @entity221 , just like that			0
@entity2 will be weary on wednesday , certainly			2
but @entity209 should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash			0
and the @entity208 ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors			0
just in case @entity84 takes the storm with him			0
@entity2 pair @entity114 ( left ) and @entity72 look dejected after their side drops out of the @entity9 on sunday			1

@entity2 were beaten 3 - 2 after extra-time by @entity12 as the *underdogs* reached the first ever @entity9 final in their club 's history
however , a blatant handball in the box by @entity14 was missed by officials , leading @entity2 striker @entity3 to feel ' robbed '
the @entity244 were left to rue the decision not to award a penalty or red card
