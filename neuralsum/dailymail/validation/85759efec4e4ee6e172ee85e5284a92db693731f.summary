@entity0 is still on track to play in this summer 's @entity2 for the @entity3			1
organisers confirmed the schedule on tuesday , in a press release which lists @entity0 as one of its stars - alongside @entity11 big - hitter @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity13 among others			0
@entity0 negotiated a release from the majority of his @entity18 contract with @entity19 next month and in may so that he could agree a new contract with @entity21			1
@entity0 negotiated a release from his @entity18 contract so that he could agree a new contract with @entity21 @entity0 has been in @entity25 for the @entity26 and this picture suggests he is struggling with jetlag the superstar batsman , sacked by @entity30 last year after their ashes whitewash defeat , is hoping a return to four - day county cricket may yet pave the way for a @entity37 recall			1
@entity30 and @entity39 chairman @entity38 has hinted that could be a possibility , if @entity0 performs well			1
the 34 - year - old has said he will ' do anything ' to play for @entity30 again , and dreams of being back for this summer 's @entity31 rematch - a series which runs from july 8 to august 24			2
@entity0 agreed in the close season to return to play for the @entity47 , as he did last summer			1
his commitments for them may , however , clash with part of the @entity31 - or his hopes of continuing to press his claims with runs for @entity21			2
the @entity56 - born batsman has n't given up on receiving a call - up for the @entity31 tests this summer the @entity2 season begins on june 20 and ends on july 26 and the tournament 's international director of cricket , @entity62 , is confident @entity0 will be there			1
' at this stage he sees himself very much as part of the @entity2 , he 's made the commitment and will have played a lot of county cricket at that time , ' he told the @entity2 's official website			2
' we do n't see that changing , he has n't indicated that 's going to be the case ( to pull out ) but if he 's suddenly picked in an ashes test match that 's all going to change very quickly			0
' i think that is probably not a realistic target for him unless something dramatic happens between now and then			0
it 's going to be hard for him , there 's a lot of hurdles to be overcome ; one , form , which will be his easiest hurdle ; two , his fitness and three is his building bridges			0
there are many to be built after what has been said from both parties over a long period of time			0
' @entity0 shared a picture of himself celebrating @entity25 's @entity26 win with @entity93			0
