by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 22 august 2013 it has witnessed major weather events from hurricane katrina in 2005 to icy @entity5 blizzards that crippled the @entity6 in 2009			1
but the @entity7 12 has finally stopped recording the weather patterns of the @entity9 of the @entity6 - after 3,788 days			1
to honour the decommissioning of the weather satellite , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) in the @entity6 has created a time - lapse video of all the weather events goes - 12 has witnessed in the last decade			1
at that time , the storm was at @entity20 strength and projected to impact @entity22 due to thruster control issues , the satellite drifted south of the equator to spend its last three years studying the weather of @entity27 , although it still managed to provide images of @entity29 in october 2012			1
launched in july 2001 , the satellite lasted well beyond its original operational design life of two years for on - orbit storage and five years of actual operations to support forecasters and scientists in @entity12 ’s @entity36 , according to the organisisation			2
' goes - 12 gave the @entity38 many years of reliable data as the operational eastern goes for accurate forecasts , from small storms to those of historic proportions , ' said @entity44 , assistant administrator for @entity12 ’s @entity45			2
the satellite started its service by monitoring weather across the @entity6 @entity9 and part of the @entity50			1
in january 2010 goes - 12 captured a powerful storm developing in the @entity6 mid-west and in the coming days , two blizzards hit the @entity9 resulting in historic snowfall totals			1
in may 2010 , when the geostationary satellite was no longer able to be maintained to meet the requirements of the @entity36 , it was shifted to a new position , where it provided coverage of weather conditions affecting @entity27 , including volcanic ash clouds , wildfires , and drought			0
to decommission goes - 12 , the @entity12 boosted the satellite further into orbit using its remaining fuel , before turning off the battery and transmitters			0
this manoeuvre was designed to reduce the chances of the satellite colliding with other operational spacecraft as well as lowering the risk of orbital debris and preventing the satellite from transmitting any signals that could interfere with any current or future spacecraft			0
on january 29 , 2010 , goes - 12 captured a powerful storm developing in the @entity6 mid-west			0
in the coming days , two blizzards hit the @entity9 resulting in historic snowfall totals			0
engineers work on the @entity7 - m ( goes - 12 ) satellite before launch			0
it provided weather imagery to support weather forecasting and severe storm tracking for the @entity9 of the @entity6 for ten years while goes - 12 is now silent , goes - 13 , which serves as the @entity89 satellite for the @entity6 and @entity7 - 15 , which covers the @entity90 , are both hovering 22,300 miles above the equator			1
another back - up satellite , @entity7 - 14 , can be activated if the others fail			0
ms @entity44 said : ' the @entity12 - @entity95 partnership is making steady progress toward developing and launching the more advanced @entity98 satellite series to position us into the future			1
' this satellite is expected to more than double the clarity of today ’s @entity7 imagery and provide more atmospheric observations by sending more images more frequently			2
data from the @entity98 instruments will be used to create different products that will help meteorologists monitor the atmosphere , land , ocean and the sun. the satellites will also carry a new ' geostationary lightning mapper ' that will provide a continuous surveillance of total lightning activity throughout the @entity119 and adjacent oceans for the first time , according to the @entity12			2
the organisation seeks to understand and predict changes in the @entity125 's environment , from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun.			0

the @entity12 has released a video to mark ten years of service by the @entity7 satellite
the satellite *focused* on the @entity9 of the @entity6 and witnessed weather events including @entity18 and the @entity5 blizzards of 2009
in the future , @entity98 will provide images that are twice as clear as the ones sent by @entity7 , which was decommissioned last week
