modern technology is supposed to be making our lives easier , but often all it does is create more pitfalls			0
21st century additions like a @entity7 page , an @entity9 profile and a smart phone often end up doing more damage to a budding relationship than good			1
these days we are more connected than ever , but that regularly pushes a potential partner further away			0
smart phones and social media often cause nightmare for men and women on dates ( picture posed by models ) on a date in the 1990s , the biggest fails a person could be responsible for were a lack of conversation , food in the teeth or a man asking the woman to split the bill			1
nowadays , the man or woman is also likely to try and photograph their food or keep checking their phone at the table			0
girls are often caught out spending too much time in the bathroom , while they compare notes on their evening with friends as their date is sat back at the table			0
and after the evening is over both parties can fall foul of the temptation to get in touch too quickly - texting within hours of the meeting or checking out the other person 's @entity7 profile immediately			1
while on a date it is considered rude to leave your phone on the table ( picture posed by models ) to save the embarrassment of being chucked before the relationship has heated up because of your addiction to technology , @entity61 e-cigarettes have listed the top ten ways to avoid showing yourself up			2
they include leaving conversations about the dating app @entity70 to evenings with your friends , and checking with a potential boyfriend or girlfriend before changing your relationship on @entity7			1
- keep phones off the dining table ; your date wants to see your face , not your screen			1
- do n’t be tempted to take a snap of your food for instagram - it will look like you ’re more interested in your followers than your date			2
- refrain from ‘ checking in ’ your location online too ; it could easily turn into a ‘ live - tweet ’ scenario or worse , a ‘ helpful ’ friend might drop by to see how it ’s going			2
- keep it offline ; immediately changing your relationship status on @entity7 if the date ’s gone well is a sure - fire way to scare off your date			1
- if it goes really well , it might be time to move the chat away from text ; take it to the next level and give them a call a few days after the date			0
- do keep your taxi app handy in case you need to make a quick exit from a date disaster and you do n’t have any cash - if you must update your friends on how the date ’s going , use snapchat – it wo n’t leave any evidence ! - do n’t brag about the number of matches you ’ve had on @entity70 , they wo n’t appreciate it - do n’t assume your date will find that funny cat meme as hilarious as your friends did ! - and finally , leave the @entity117 at home , as recording your companion for post-date analysis is n’t likely to get you a second date			0
