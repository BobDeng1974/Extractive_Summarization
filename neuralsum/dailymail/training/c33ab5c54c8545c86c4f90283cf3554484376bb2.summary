by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor furious @entity2 today revealed how he rebuked his staff for the @entity5 wreath blunder which meant he failed to write a personal dedication to the war dead			1
he was among senior politicians ridiculed on monday for laying a wreath at a ceremony in @entity11 with a label just scrawled with ' from the deputy prime minister ' in black felt pen			1
@entity15 and prince @entity16 both penned personal notes to attach to their wreaths , and today mr @entity2 his staff are ‘ very well aware ’ of his anger for failing to arrange for him to do the same			1
in contrast @entity15 's message read : ' your most enduring legacy is our liberty			1
we must never forget ' and was signed personally by the prime minister			1
the @entity42 also wrote his own note , which said : ' in everlasting memory , @entity16 '			1
but the many other politicians laid their wreaths with the standard labels provided by organisers			0
@entity27 was accused of being ' pathetic ' and ' distasteful ' after his a scruffy message read only : ' from the @entity50 '			0
political aides had suggested it was the fault of the organisers for not making the offer to signatories to write their own message in advance			1
but mr @entity2 appeared to suggest he considered his own staff were at fault for not recognising the importance of the event , and asked for a label to write in advance			2
today mr @entity2 was challenged on his radio phone - in about why none of his staff thought to ask to write a note in advance prime minister @entity15 left a message which read ' your most enduring legacy is our liberty			1
we must never forget ' and was signed personally by the prime minister speaking on his @entity74 phone - in , mr @entity2 said : ‘ clearly everybody understands that i would much prefer to have been given the opportunity which i was n’t given			1
‘ many other people were not either			0
the organisers understand that loud and clear			0
’ asked what he had said to his staff who could have asked to write a message , he added : ‘ i have made it absolutely clear that i would have liked to have had the opportunity which i was n’t given , to write a personal message			2
’ he said his staff are ‘ very well aware ’ of his anger at the blunder			0
‘ it was just a feeling of regret that i had not been given that opportunity , ’ he added			0
the incident happened at hundreds of people gathered at @entity91 for the wreath - laying ceremony			2
chief secretary to the treasury @entity93 , home secretary @entity95 and @entity96 , secretary of state for communities , were among those who attended the hour - long service in the heart of the city			0
but anger at the impersonal labels on the wreaths briefly overshadowed a day of poignant commemorations			0
the labels of mr @entity27 and @entity108 's first minister @entity107 were criticised for being impersonal and insensitive mr @entity2 had been challenged by a caller to @entity74 , @entity110 in @entity111 , who told the deputy pm : ‘ what happened there because now a man of your stature in your position should be ready for an event like that ? you should have your own hand written note			1
‘ you knew that you was going to that wreath laying ceremony as did @entity27			0
what happened and why did n’t your secretary get you prepared ? ’ ‘ you go to these ceremonies numerous times of the year			0
why had you not personally right , on your way to the event whether you ’d be on the train , on a helicopter or whatever in the back of the chauffer driven car , why did you not personally hand write a note ready to slip in there ? ’ mr @entity2 protested that such events were organised in a ‘ very sort of strict way ’ and those taking part ‘ basically do what you ’re told ’			1
he noted that @entity28 leader @entity27 , @entity108 ’s first minister @entity107 , @entity144 ’s first minister @entity143 and the @entity146 first minister @entity145 all had wraths with the same scrawled label			0
‘ of course if i ’d been give the wreath before the note , before , i would have been more than honoured to write a note			2
’ asked what his message would have read , mr @entity2 added : ‘ i honestly think there ’s not much point you know to sort of lurching around trying to point the finger of blame			2
‘ i would have wanted to express my everlasting gratitude and that of our generation for the extraordinary sacrifices that lost their lives in @entity5 , their sacrifice has allowed us to enjoy our freedom			0
