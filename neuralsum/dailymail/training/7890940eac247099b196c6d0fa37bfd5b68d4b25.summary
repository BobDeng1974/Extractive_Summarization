by @entity0 scientists have uncovered a mysterious structure that surround the earth rather like a giant zebraprint jacket			0
the strange structure has never been seen before , and initially baffled scientists			0
stripes extend through the inner radiation belt , moving as the @entity10 rotates			1
the inner belt is dominated by electrons and the outer one by protons			0
the radiation belts are dynamic doughnut - shaped regions around our planet , extending high above the atmosphere , made up of high - energy particles , both electrons and charged particles called ions , which are trapped by @entity10 's magnetic field			1
radiation levels across the belts are affected by solar activity that causes energy and particles to flow into near - @entity10 space			1
scientists discovered the new , persistent structure in one of two radiation belts surrounding @entity10			2
@entity38 's twin @entity37 probes spacecraft spotted the pattern , which that resembles slanted zebra stripes			2
the structure is produced by the slow rotation of @entity10 , previously considered incapable of affecting the motion of radiation belt particles , which have velocities approaching the speed of light			1
scientists had previously believed that increased solar wind activity was the primary force behind any structures in our planet 's radiation belts			0
however , these zebra stripes were shown to be visible even during low solar wind activity , which prompted a new search for how they were generated			0
' it is because of the unprecedented resolution of our energetic particle experiment , @entity64 , that we now understand that the inner belt electrons are , in fact , always organized in zebra patterns , ' said @entity68 , lead author of the paper at the @entity70 , or @entity70 , in @entity71			2
because of the tilt in @entity10 's magnetic field axis , the planet 's rotation generates an oscillating , weak electric field that permeates through the entire inner radiation belt			1
the stretching and folding process results in the striped pattern observed across the entire inner belt , extending from above @entity10 's atmosphere , about 500 miles above the planet 's surface up to roughly 8,000 miles			1
' the @entity64 instrument has remarkably fine resolution and so it was able to bring into focus a phenomena that we previously did n't even know existed , ' said @entity90 , the mission scientist for the @entity91 at @entity38 's @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 ' better yet , we have a great team of scientists to take advantage of these unprecedented observations : we could n't have interpreted this data without analysis from strong theoreticians			0
