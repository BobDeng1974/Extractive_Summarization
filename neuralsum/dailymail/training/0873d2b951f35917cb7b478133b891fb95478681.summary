by @entity0 last updated at 12:09 am on 8th february 2012 smacking is banned in 20 @entity3 countries but still legal with some restrictions in the @entity5 and @entity6 spanking or slapping your child if they misbehave could make them more aggressive with others later in life , scientists claim			2
a review of 20 years worth of research found that the more often children were slapped , spanked or yelled at when they were naughty the more likely they were to display similar behaviour when they grew up			2
researchers dr @entity17 from the @entity18 of @entity19 and @entity20 of the @entity21 , wrote in the @entity22 : ' virtually without exception , these studies found that physical punishment was associated with higher levels of aggression against parents , siblings , peers and spouses			1
' it comes just a week after @entity34 mp @entity33 said last summer 's riots were a result of parents being unable to physically discipline their children for fear that social workers would take them away			1
calling for a return to the @entity43 laws on discipline , the mp said it was easier for middle - class parents to control their children as they could afford to pay for private schools , which have tougher discipline than state schools , as well as activities such as tennis lessons			1
he said : ' many of my constituents came up to me after the riots and blamed the @entity56 , saying , " you guys stopped us being able to smack our children			1
" ' however , the authors of the latest review said spanking children could be counter-productive			0
they pointed to one study of 500 families that found children were less likely to challenge adults when the parents were trained to stop punishing them physically			1
they added that many of the studies found that raising a hand to a child increased their chances of developing mental health problems such as depression			0
is spanking necessary to discipline children ? the authors noted that societies view of physical punishment had changed over the past 20 years and it was no longer considered the best way to deal with unruly children			1
in the @entity5 a recent poll found most parents said they used ' time outs ' or took away favourite toys as punishment			1
however , a fifth said they were ' very likely ' to spank their children			0
smacking is currently legal in the @entity5 with some restrictions which vary from state to state			0
however , it is banned in 20 @entity3 countries , including @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99			0
in @entity6 ' reasonable chastisement ' in the home is allowed however this was not allowed to ' leave a mark ' on the skin from 2004			0
a recent poll found 71 per cent of parents would support a smacking ban			2
the authors said doctors should help parents learn non-violent , effective approaches to discipline , as many do n't understand what prompts a child 's behaviour			1
dr @entity17 told @entity118 : ' they ( parents ) are more likely to believe that their child is being defiant or intentionally bad , but in most cases , children are simply doing what is normal for their development			2
' techniques include recognising that toddlers tend to say no to everything and ignoring them for 10 seconds when they act up before redirecting their behaviour			0
another method is to lay down rules but also explain why they are used .			0

last week @entity34 mp @entity33 said summer riots *due* to parents being unable to use physical discipline
