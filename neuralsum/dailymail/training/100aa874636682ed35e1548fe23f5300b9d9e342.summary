@entity0 may have officially become an oap at 65 but there are still one or two scores he has to settle before he actually contemplates retirement			1
he goes into tonight ’s @entity6 tie against @entity7 at the @entity8 with enough problems to add to his worry lines — not least exposing 22 - year - old @entity12 to a @entity6 debut when his most recent competitive match was in the @entity16 last season			1
but despite being old enough to qualify for a bus pass , @entity0 still has a point to prove in @entity19 , famously never having won the @entity6 despite contesting it 16 times with @entity21 and twice with @entity22			1
‘ no , my age is my age			2
you have to live with that			2
until now i am lucky to be in shape			2
but the desire and motivation is stronger than ever			1
' i am so keen to do well with my team this season			2
i want the club and the team to do as well as they can , it ’s my dream			2
i want to give absolutely everything for my team to do it			0
‘ i am not a celebrator of birthdays			0
what is important is my team performs well and i will dedicate all my energy to get things right			0
' there is a difference between the quality of our performances and points we have won			0
so we want to add to the quality of our performance , and get the points that we feel are there in the team			0
that little percentage , where we can improve , is vital			0
’ @entity0 ’s keeper crisis will be the key preoccupation tonight , with @entity12 , replacing suspended @entity67 , having conceded five goals in a @entity70 tie at @entity71 two years ago			1
@entity12 is now the only fit cover for @entity67 in @entity0 's injury - hit squad @entity0 remained upbeat about his squad despite the huge number of injuries effecting @entity21 @entity28 joins the @entity21 injury list which also includes ... @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 , while @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity25 are all still struggling for fitness			1
and @entity12 will have a job to do after tonight as the club ’s temporary no 2 keeper , with @entity0 revealing @entity91 @entity28 will be out until the @entity92 in yet another @entity21 injury setback			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity28 had his first injury at @entity34 ( his former club ) , which was a knee problem , and i think he was a bit rushed back			1
he then got injured during the @entity98			0
and after that he came to us injured			0
‘ i had to bring him on against @entity100 without a warm - up , without being prepared , and he had a recurrence of that injury			1
that means he is out for two to three months			0
now we have to be really careful because he has a recurrence of a thigh injury that ’s very difficult			1
it ’s a long - term injury			2
’ at least @entity0 can welcome back @entity84 against @entity7 after he came through his substitute appearance against @entity110 on saturday			1
the midfielder could start here in @entity113 tonight along with @entity82 , who also returned to the bench on saturday			2
@entity12 ( left ) is set to start for @entity21 in their game with @entity7 as @entity116 also trained young keeper @entity117 ( left ) also trained alongside @entity118 ( right ) as @entity21 's crisis deepens @entity21 were given a boost ahead of wednesday 's match as midfielder @entity84 was able to train @entity0 has had to call up young keepers @entity118 , @entity116 , @entity117			1
read more about @entity0 's young keepers here			1
@entity25 has backed @entity12 to provide @entity21 with the stability they need against the @entity126 champions			1
‘ he has grown up in the last two years , playing at @entity127 on loan in the @entity16 , which is a very tough league to play in , especially in @entity129 as a foreign lad , ’ said @entity25			0
‘ we ’re confident in him , we train with him every day , see what he can do and he ’ll be ready			0
’ the @entity129 midfielder maintains that despite only having won four games all season , @entity21 will eventually dispel the notion they are a lightweight team			1
@entity21 's @entity139 stars were all smiles on the train to @entity126 ahead of their @entity6 tie @entity85 also took part in training as he steps up his return from nine months out after a knee injury ‘ i think that ’s unfair			1
maybe we have n’t got the results we wanted in some games , or drawn when should have won , but if we look back we ’ve had a positive start			2
' ok , we need more points than we have in the table , but going forward we are confident we can get the points we need			0
‘ we just ignore that criticism			0
we know what we can do in midfield			0
maybe our strongest point is going forward , we know we can defend , we have players who can put their foot in and we have players who can organise in @entity162			0
' we have good defensive players			0
we know on saturday the performance was n’t good enough			0

@entity0 turns 65 on wednesday , when @entity21 take on @entity7
@entity0 says his ' desire and motivation is stronger than ever '
@entity28 out until late *january* with thigh injury
