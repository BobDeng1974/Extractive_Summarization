@entity0 has a secret weapon			1
you ca n’t see it , or touch it , but his imaginary telephone line has proved vital in his role as historical advisor on @entity8			1
an expert on protocol past and present , @entity0 has brought his forensic knowledge of 20th - century history to bear on every series of the much - loved drama but the cast ’s fondness for rather modern displays of affection is something of a bête noire for him – hence the imaginary phone line			1
' i 'm always trying to stop people hugging , ' he exclaims			2
' we 've become so physically expressive as people – it ’s a miracle we 're ever unclamped from each other frankly , and the actors are very keen on it – but it ’s just not the language of this period			2
' so i often suggest they imagine that the telephone line is there as a means of creating distance			0
' he may be behind the scenes but @entity0 is vital to the making of @entity8 , as the dvd of series five makes clear			1
in an accompanying exclusive documentary , he takes us through the bewildering minutiae of 1920s etiquette , illustrated by footage from the @entity8 set in which we see him scurrying around altering the position of a soup spoon here , the hankie in a tweed jacket pocket there			1
for @entity0 the devil is very much in the detail			1
at one point he gently chides @entity71 ’s @entity70 for slouching in front of her @entity73 grandmother , at another he reminds @entity75 ’s @entity74 that she would never leave her evening gloves on the table after dinner			0
this is how you do it : mr @entity0 on the set of this season 's @entity8 with actor @entity84 take your hands out of your pockets ! @entity87 , who plays @entity88 , gets a telling off detail : mr @entity0 is known to cast members as ' the @entity91 ' because of his exhaustive knowledge even @entity93 , played by @entity87 , does n’t escape the odd ticking off , mostly for putting his hands in his pockets			1
' of course , all these things seem to be absolute nonsense now , but if you ’re trying to take people legitimately on a journey in time you have to attend to these things to make it successful , ' says @entity0			1
it ’s helpful to put him among the action now and then , to which end he ’s cropped up variously on screen as a butler at the @entity73 ’s @entity109 , a staff colonel to a visiting general , and a river ghillie in the second year @entity113 which saw the cast decamp to @entity115			2
indeed , it is @entity0 ’s hands that hold the ruler over the knives and forks on the table every time the titles roll			1
his crowning glory though came in last year ’s @entity113 , playing the @entity125 to @entity126 in the scenes where @entity128 was presented at @entity129 , a position from which he had the opportunity to supervise the behaviour of the key cast members during the ritual			2
and it ’s clear the cast think he ’s marvellous			0
on set he ’s nicknamed ' the @entity91 ' , and the actors are fulsome in their praise			0
' i love @entity0 , ' says @entity142 , who plays lord @entity143			1
' he literally taught me everything , how to tie my shoelaces , how to stand , how to ride a horse			0
' @entity87 , meanwhile , cites @entity0 ’s exhaustive knowledge of history as another great strength			1
' he ’s very useful in providing context for the interaction between characters , ' he says			0
which is where that telephone line comes in			0
although he ’s not a director , @entity0 usually gets his way when it comes to the cast doing things properly			1
he cites a scene in series three , in which @entity93 and @entity163 , played by @entity164 , came to an agreement over their future roles after months of conflict			0
' @entity87 and @entity164 desperately wanted this hug at the end			0
so , ok , film it – nothing wrong with filming something , ' he smiles			0
' but let ’s film another version , in which they lightly tap each other ’s shoulders instead			0
' the latter was the version that was used			0
@entity181 : mr @entity0 , seen here with director @entity183 , also moonlights as an extra from time to time starring role : in season four , mr @entity0 had a cameo as the @entity125 in episode nine stiff : according to mr @entity0 , displays of affection and hugging were n't really done until the 1950s whenever a character has a storyline that touches on history , @entity0 ’s there to fill in the background			1
this includes @entity197 , whose @entity73 had , we learned , possibly got a skeleton in her cupboard in the form of an illicit romance with a @entity204 aristocrat , now living in penury in @entity206 after the @entity207			0
' @entity208 and i talked about how these @entity204 came to be in @entity210 , that something like this happening suddenly seemed possible for the @entity210 aristocracy , ' he recalls			0
the principle challenge with the latest series , set in 1924 , was persuading the cast that while times may have marched on , stiff manners still governed			1
' they were saying , " @entity0 we 're in the fifth series , can i relax a bit ? " to which i told them , " you can relax a bit in about 1955 "			1
' @entity0 is something of a renaissance man : an author of well - received history books , he is @entity231 commentator for @entity232 and covered the @entity233 for them in 2012			2
royal life : during his stint as the @entity238 's herald , mr @entity0 persuaded her to be photographed at @entity239 tweaks : mr @entity0 spends hours checking and double checking place settings and table etiquette popular : despite his restrictions on hugging , mr @entity0 is a hugely popular member of the @entity8 team he ’s not just an observer , but a part of the @entity248 too : in 1998 the @entity238 appointed him as one of her heralds , and it was he who persuaded her majesty to be photographed in her regalia out among the peat and heather at a misty @entity239 for a book to mark the 60th anniversary of her @entity259 , an image that graced @entity263 ’s cover last year			1
despite his best efforts , the odd clanger slips through on @entity8 , much to the delight of the viewers who revel in pointing out inaccuracies			2
' it ’s about reputation , ' says @entity0			2
' if you have a good reputation people want to attack it because it ’s more fun – so in a way i look forward to challenges like that as it suggests i have standards			0
' it ’s impossible , at this point , not to bring up the plastic water bottle seen in the background of the publicity shots for this series			0
was this a blot on @entity0 ’s almost - impeccable copybook ? ' oh , i 'm perfectly happy to be held responsible for that , ' he hoots			2
' a lot of people have said , " what about that plastic bottle ? " and i 'll admit i thought , " @entity297 , if that ’s about it , then i 've done alright "			0
