it is easy to be envious of celebrities who upload luxurious photos on @entity3 from their private planes or vip lounges			1
but a life spent criss - crossing the globe is n't always as exciting and glamorous as we may think			1
proving that stars are n't immune to the everyday problems the average traveller faces , professional golfer @entity9 received a lot of sympathy when @entity15 - the official carrier of the @entity16 - apparently ' lost ' his clubs			1
he is not the only one to have had a less - than - ideal experience , with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 joining the ranks of irritated travellers			1
pro-golfer @entity9 flew to @entity24 last sunday - sadly his golf clubs did not @entity9 tweeted his frustration to @entity15 , who misplaced his golf clubs when he was en route to the master 's tournament this week @entity9 starring in the master 's golf tournament in @entity24 this week is one of the highlights of a pro-golfer 's professional years			1
@entity9 flew in for the prestigious competition last sunday to prepare - however his golf clubs did not			2
but , ever the professional , the sportsman did n't have a meltdown on @entity41 , he simply used his social media site to point out that he had a ' tourney ' to play in this week			1
clearly , his cool - headed response paid off and just six hours later , @entity15 returned his clubs to him			2
@entity9 was quick to thank the airline and even apologised ' for the mix - up '			2
@entity48 at the airport from a flight from @entity51			1
the model flew into a rage when her suitcases were not loaded onto her plane and demanded the captain find them and personally show them to her @entity48 the jetsetting model is infamous for her temper and it seems she was not impressed when informed she was among passengers whose bags had failed to be loaded on a @entity67 flight from @entity51 to @entity68 in april 2008			1
the captain made the decision to personally speak to her to apologise for the error , but the model flew into a rage at the mishap , which happened shortly after the disastrous opening of @entity67 's @entity75 at @entity76 - when problems with baggage systems meant many passengers were forced to fly without their luggage			1
@entity82 @entity81 heard how the model shouted at the captain saying : ' i ca n't believe you have lost my f * * * * * * bag			1
bring me my f * * * * * * bags now			2
' when he walked off she was reported to shout after him claiming : ' you are a racist			2
you would n't be doing this if i was white			2
' she was later forcibly removed from the plane by police with whom she had a further confrontation			2
she later pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer , one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress and using threatening , abusive words or behaviour			2
the star was fined £ 2,300 , ordered to pay £ 200 in compensation to the police officers she attacked , £ 150 to the @entity67 captain and complete 200 hours of community service			1
@entity115 reality of flying : @entity118 star was banned from the @entity67 business lounge for not being 18 @entity21 , who plays the sword - wielding @entity115 , hit back at @entity67 for their no under - 18s rule @entity21 despite holding her own in @entity126 , it appears @entity127 star @entity21 , who plays the feisty @entity115 , can not be trusted in the @entity67 business lounge			0
as she was under the age of 18 , the actress and business class traveller was forced to spend her time at the airport away from the comforts of the lounge , which includes meals , drinks and even exclusive spa treatments			1
although she was adamant she did not want special treatment and it was more the principle that she was old enough to travel , but not old enough to sit in the lounge , the airline did not budge on the rules			1
@entity67 simply tweeted back with the reply : ' @entity143			0
we 're sorry if you were disappointed , lounge guests must be 18 or older			0
we look forward to welcoming you soon			0
' the reply was not enough for @entity149			0
. @ @entity150 fully understand that , my question is why ? why can we travel alone but not use the lounge ? it makes no sense			1
' @entity67 then explained it was because the business class lounges offer a self - service complimentary bar stocked with alcohol which is not monitored by staff round the clock			0
pro-golfer @entity163 also had his clubs lost by @entity15 when he flew into the @entity165 ahead of the @entity166 a similar twitter complaint query from the golfer saw his clubs swiftly returned to him for the competition @entity163 @entity9 was not the only golfer to have lost his prized possession			1
@entity163 , who won both the @entity16 and the @entity173 last year , similarly had his golf clubs lost by @entity15 as he flew into @entity165 ahead of the @entity166 last year			1
once again , the sporting world proved just how polite its stars could be			1
@entity163 simply tweeted : ' @entity15 landed in @entity165 yesterday morning from @entity177 and still no golf clubs ... sort of need them this week ... can someone help ! ? ' following the plea , they were returned to him , and he even managed a @entity15 related pun with his follow - up tweet showing his gratitude			0
no special treatment for the @entity185 : last year @entity186 and her family received their bags two days late , with items missing , after their flight to @entity192 from @entity76 @entity186 expressed her horror over twitter that many items were missing from her cases @entity186 @entity186 accused @entity67 staff of ' ransacking ' her designer luggage as she flew with the airline to @entity200 in june last year for a family holiday			1
the wife of famous footballer @entity203 , received her suitcase two days late and then reportedly found that items had been stolen from her belongings			0
she tweeted : ' bags , shoes , bikinis , clothes , toiletries , underwear , pj 's , make up , toiletries taken			1
disgusting & the customer service getting is terrible			0
' the issue was a result of a computer glitch at @entity75 , which caused conveyor belts which loaded bags onto planes to shut down			0
staff were left having to load the bags manually , but were not able to keep up with the busy flight schedules , resulting in many planes departing without bags being loaded			0
@entity76 declined to comment on mrs @entity20 's situation but @entity67 said they had contacted mrs @entity20 to begin an investigation into the incident			1
mrs @entity20 faced a string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could probably afford to replace the items			1
but she angrily replied that the money was n't the issue , tweeting : ' and you can stick all the sarcastic comments about money			0
it 's not all about money it 's about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff that i need for my holiday '			1
@entity248 : @entity249 received a black eye on her @entity252 flight to @entity68 as someone reclined their chair too far back the daughter of @entity257 expressed her anger over twitter to her followers @entity249 the fashion police star suffered an altogether more unusual plane nightmare when she received a black eye on her @entity252 flight to @entity68 back in 2012			0
the star tweeted saying : ' really ? the asshole infront of me almost knocked me out putting her seat back might get a black eye @entity269 going2 kick her seat all the way to @entity68			0
' it turns out her prediction was correct as she later tweeted the result of the rogue action , which appeared to show a bruise forming under on eye			0
the star continued to document her displeasure and the result of her ' seat kicking ' payback			0
she wrote : ' after kicking her seat form giving me a black she confronted me and laughed at the fact she gave me a black eye ! ' and it seems @entity257 was n't happy with the airline either - although she did praise the staff			0
she later tweeted : ' thank you so much @entity252 4 this wonderful black eye fix your f * * * * * * seats getting smashed in the face w / a tv is so fun ' ' regardless to how s * * * @ delta is the stewardess really looked after me ! she was amazing ! ' @entity19 had her luggage opened and items taken on her flight to @entity303 with @entity67 the star , who now has 30 million followers on @entity41 said some of the missing items were irreplaceable @entity19 it seems even the @entity309 suffer from airport woes as they jet - set around the world			1
@entity19 accused @entity67 of searching her bags and ' removing ' items when flying to @entity303 three years ago			0
@entity19 tweeted her frustration to her millions of fans saying she wished we could return to the days of locking suitcases on flight			0
' very disappointed in @entity67 for opening my luggage & taking some special items of mine ! some things are sentimental &not replaceable			1
' the star went on to claim staff at the airport may have taken several handbags and ' priceless ' sunglasses she inherited from her late father			2
a spokesman for @entity67 said at the time : ' we are continuing to investigate this matter			0
' our customer travelled from @entity335 to @entity75 to @entity68			0
' @entity75 has some of the most sophisticated automated baggage systems in the world , which are able to monitor bags every minute of their time in the terminal			0
' at this stage , we have discovered no evidence to suggest that the bag in question was interfered with at @entity76			0
' our investigation is also seeking to establish details of the bag 's passage through @entity335 and @entity68 airports			2
' @entity351 found fame on the series who 's @entity355 , before starring in @entity358 series @entity356 tv actress @entity351 was told that she had to abide to the @entity351 mistresses and charmed actress @entity351 was banned from taking her breast milk on a flight on thursday			2
security staff said the amount was over the regulatory liquid amount , but it would have been permitted had her baby been with her			0
the 42 - year - old mum took to twitter to call @entity76 out on their actions , querying why this was the case , as she would n't even need to pump if her baby was there			0
the airport replied that there was not an exception to the rule and each individual container within the bag must have a maximum capacity no greater than 100ml .			2

celebrities can make travel seem *effortless* and glamorous on social media
stars experience the same airport mishaps regardless what they pay
the @entity20 's luggage was ransacked and @entity48 's was lost
