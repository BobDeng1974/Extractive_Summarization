by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 16 september 2013 a corporate lawyer today revealed the moment she felt ‘ pure terror ’ when she discovered a fox licking her sleeping six - year - old daughter ’s face after it sneaked into their @entity7 home			1
@entity10 said she did a double take when she saw the urban scavenger on top of her daughter @entity14 ’s bed on the fourth floor of the family ’s £ 1.5 million house in @entity19 , south @entity7			1
luckily , little @entity14 was not harmed after ms @entity10 chased the fox around the house for 90 minutes before it escaped out a roof window			1
intruder : this fox was found licking a six - year - old girl 's face as she slept in her bed in south @entity7 before it was chased out by the girl 's mother ms @entity10 , 40 , was working in her office next to @entity14 ’s bedroom when she heard a loud thud			1
she rushed into the room to find a fox licking around the girl ’s chin and mouth as she slept			2
she said the fox may have been attracted by a fruit - flavoured moisturising cream applied to treat @entity14 ’s dry skin			1
ms @entity10 chased it into a spare room before calling on a neighbour to help get the fox out of the house because her husband was out			1
mother - of - two ms @entity10 said : ‘ i went to check on her and saw this fox on top of her with its tail all puffed out , looking really scary			1
‘ it looked at me then took another lick of @entity14 ’s chin			2
i had a few seconds of pure terror where i just froze to the spot			0
unwanted house guest : @entity10 , @entity14 's mother , called on people not to feed foxes in a bid to stop them coming close to residential areas left the door open : ms @entity10 left the back door of the £ 1.5million family home in @entity19 ( pictured ) open the night that the fox got into the house ‘ i rushed to pick @entity14 up and took her out the room , but it took another hour - and - a - half before i could get the fox out			1
it had messed all over the room			0
’ in 2010 , nine - month - old twin girls @entity76 and @entity77 suffered horrific injuries when they were mauled by a fox as they slept in their cots at their family home in @entity82 , east @entity7 after the patio doors were left open			1
incredibly this time , little @entity14 slept through the latest drama and was not injured			1
her mother believes the fox got in through the back door of the house in a leafy suburban street , near @entity90 in south @entity7 , which had been propped open as it was a balmy evening at around 8pm on tuesday september 3			1
she said : ‘ i wo n’t be leaving it open again			2
’ ms @entity10 called on people to stop feeding foxes as she believes attracts them into urban areas			1
she said : ‘ a lot of people feed the foxes , but they forget they are vermin			2
‘ i think if people stopped feeding them there would be a lot less around and things like this would n’t happen			0
‘ you hear about the fox attacks on children and after the shock and the adrenaline you realise what a lucky escape we had			2
‘ when i walked in i just did this cartoon double take , i was like “ what is this ? ” i was just so shocked			0
after i realised the fox had not mauled my child , the adrenaline just kicked in			0
but afterwards , of course i was terrified - you just keep thinking what could have happened			0
‘ my little girl does not know anything about it			0
she was asleep the whole time			0
after it happened i tried to wake her , but she was still in that first stage of sleep			0
i ’m now glad she does n’t know			0
defence mechanism : foxes are not naturally aggressive but do attack if they feel threatened ( file photo ) ‘ thankfully there have been no ill - effects , but who knows what sort of diseases foxes carry ? i ’m just so relieved it did n’t savage her			1
’ a spokesman for @entity140 said although foxes are not naturally aggressive they will attack when they feel threatened			1
she said : ‘ in this case the fox could indeed have been attracted by the girl ’s face cream , but he could have been licking her face in the same way a dog would and had no intention to attack her			2
‘ when a fox attacks it is purely a last resort defence mechanism			0
it ’s out of fear , not out of aggression , usually if they are approached by humans or ca n’t find their way out of somewhere			0
‘ but foxes are becoming more habituated to human environments largely due to the abundance of food in urban areas			0
‘ people can unintentionally encourage foxes by leaving food out in the garden for other animals			0
some people leave food scraps or cat food out for hedgehogs , for example			0
and foxes eat anything so they ’ll go for it			0
‘ to minimise the chance of a fox getting in the house people should make sure their bins are well maintained and try not to tame them as they need to still be scared of you			2
if they lose that fear they become more bold and that ’s potentially when they get into houses			0
’ while @entity14 was lucky to be left untouched by the fox , other children have been less fortunate			1
earlier this year , five - week - old baby @entity187 was mauled by a fox in his family living room in south @entity7 earlier this year			1
his mother @entity191 wrestled with the fox and fought it off but her son was left soaked in blood and had gashes to his face and a black eye where the fox hit him against the door frame			1
bedside vigil : @entity187 lying in his hospital bed after he was attacked by a fox in his home in south @entity7 earlier this year			2
he had to have his finger reattached in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek @entity210 attack : in 2010 , nine - month - old twins @entity77 and @entity76 ( pictured with mother @entity212 ) @entity77 were mauled by a fox in @entity82 , @entity7 @entity187 had to have his finger reattached in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek , as well as treatment for injuries to his face and head			1
@entity76 and her twin sister @entity77 fell victim to the fox in 2010 when it crept in through patio doors left open in the heat			1
@entity77 , who was the more badly hurt of the pair with ‘ life changing ’ injuries to her arms			0
their mother , @entity212 , described the attack as ‘ looking like something from a horror movie ’			2
in january this year , terrified jogger @entity234 , 17 , fought off a fox that sank its teeth into her leg after it leapt out of the darkness and bit her as she ran in @entity239 , @entity240			0
brave pet owner @entity241 was forced to wrestle her two - year - old @entity242 from the jaws of a fox in her back garden in @entity246 , @entity247 in 2012			2
the 29 - year - old heard screams and ran out to find the fox had jumped over the fence and was attacking @entity242 - leaving the dog with severe bite wounds to her neck			0
there are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the @entity256			0
