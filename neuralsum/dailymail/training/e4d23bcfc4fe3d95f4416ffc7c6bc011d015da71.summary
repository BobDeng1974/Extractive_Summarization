for those who puzzle over how supermodels stay so whippet thin , a former @entity1 editor has lifted the lid on the horrific lengths some go to to maintain their wispy waistlines and cut - glass hipbones			2
@entity8 , sensationally fired from her role as editor of @entity11 @entity1 last may , has written a tell - all book about the fashion industry , claiming some models eat tissue paper to feel full , starve themselves for days on end , spend frequent stints on hospital drips , and are often so weak with hunger they struggle to keep their eyes open			1
as reported by @entity24 in the @entity25 , @entity23 also explains that within the fashion world there is ' thin ' , and then there is ' @entity29 thin ' - a term that describes the size of a model who has starved their already fragile body down two dress sizes in order to be cast in big oversea shows			0
@entity8 ' book , @entity23 , is a tell - all expose of the fashion industry , and the lengths some models go to to stay thin in her controversial tome , @entity8 says she once spent three days on a shoot with a model who did n't see her eat a single meal - and that on the final day she could barely stand or keep her eyes open			1
she also reveals how an @entity50 model once told her that her flat mate was a ' fit ' model - a model whose body is used by top designers for clothes - fittings - and therefore spent lots of time on a drip			0
@entity58 spent 25 years at @entity11 @entity1 - her book 's subhead is ' from front desk to editor ' - and steered the ship for 13 of them			1
her departure was sudden - she was called to a meeting and dismissed , forced to clean her office and leave without bidding farewell to her staff - and she was replaced quickly by @entity69 , editor of @entity70			0
@entity8 describes her sacking simply as a ' regime change ' that was part and parcel of the dramatic @entity1 narrative , but some critics believe the new book - her first - is her way of exacting revenge on the @entity79 - owned title			0
@entity80 watches painfully - thin @entity82 walk for @entity83 at @entity84 , left , and former @entity11 @entity1 editor @entity8 , right			2
