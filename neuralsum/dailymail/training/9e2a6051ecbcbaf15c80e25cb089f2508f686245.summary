the man who admitted handling the jug , @entity13 , 23 , from @entity15 in @entity10 was jailed for three years and three months at @entity16			1
the @entity2 is a national treasure , and one of only three in @entity4			1
it is so precious that the museum in @entity16 , @entity21 , can not now afford to display it because of insurance costs after the theft			1
how the bronze 14th century @entity2 came to be in @entity13 's lock up in @entity27 , @entity10 remains unknown , but it has now been safely returned			1
lawyer @entity28 who defended @entity13 said that it was ' so valuable that it was probably unsaleable , which is probably why someone of 23 finds it 's being offloaded on him '			2
she argued that @entity13 was too naive to understand the value or significance of the item			2
she also said that he was too frightened to tell the police about the jug			0
when the jug was stolen last year , @entity39 launched a national hunt and @entity42 offered a £ 25,000 reward for its recovery			1
caught on cctv : the theft from @entity16 's @entity21 was featured on @entity48 's crimewatch but the face was too difficult to identify it is thought the jug was made for either @entity52 , a @entity53 at @entity54 who died in 1391 and is buried in @entity16			0
the other owner could have been @entity57 's great nephew @entity56 , the first @entity58 who lived near @entity59 and had associations with royalty			0
made of bronze , the jug weighs 6.1 kg and is 31.5 cm tall			0
it is decorated with coats of arms , badges and the inscription ' my lord wenlock '			0
in 2005 the jug went up for sale at @entity73 and was nearly sold to @entity75 's @entity74			0
its export was stopped that year by culture minister @entity78 after experts ruled it was of ' outstanding significance ' police who had been watching @entity13 and co-defendant @entity84 , 25 , from @entity85 in @entity10 , also found ecstasy and cocaine packaging in the lock up , as well as two stun guns disguised as mobile phones and body armour			1
@entity84 was jailed for five years after admitting owning the stun guns and being involved in supplying drugs			1
@entity13 's sentence included one year for being implicated in supplying cocaine , and two years and three months for handling stolen goods			1
@entity97 , a family friend of @entity13 was called as a character witness for him			0
he said : ' @entity99 's never been no angel , he 's always been cheeky , but he 's always done good			0
' ' i do n't know what 's happened in the last year that has led up to this			2
' @entity13 was told by judge @entity105 : ' you have been extremely vague on the circumstances in which the @entity2 came into your possession			1
' individuals far more sophisticated than you , higher up the chain were involved in this matter			0
you have got into something way over your head			2
' the jug was bought in 2006 by the @entity21 for £ 750,000 with help from various trusts and private donations , which saved it from being sold to a museum in @entity75			1
write caption here it was displayed in a high security cabinet which was smashed with a drain cover by the burglar on saturday may 12 after 11pm			0
prosecutor @entity126 read a statement to the court from @entity129 , the director of @entity130			0
@entity129 said : ' it was wonderful to get the jug back , it had been totally devastating for staff and visitors			2
' she said the knock - on effect had been that other valuable items had had to be removed from display , and there was now a significant increase in the cost of security which effected services that could be provided for the community			0
happy ending : the jug has been returned to its home , as presented to @entity129 , director of the museum by the poilce			2

the @entity2 was saved for the nation in 2006 only to be stolen last year
there are only three of the 14th century jugs in @entity4
museum it was stolen from said that staff were ' devastated '
*garage* where it was found contained @entity165 drug traces and stun guns
judge told the man found handling it ' you were in way over your head '
