@entity2 discus thrower @entity0 dazzled spectators at @entity4 with an impressive performance and some equally impressive socks			1
the 23 - year - old was sporting some rather sharp footwear in the qualifiers and his throw of 61.08m saw him through to the final			2
sock it to them : @entity0 turned heads in the discus with his choice of attire and his performance diving is supposed to be a sport of great grace and composure , but @entity24 diver @entity23 ended up falling flat on his face in the preliminary round of the men ’s 1m springboard			1
his attempt to pull off a particularly tricky dive ended in disaster after he failed to complete his final forward rotation and he ended up hitting the water on the horizontal			1
he still managed to qualify , though			2
flat out : @entity36 's landing left much to be desired @entity38 champion @entity37 has been slammed by @entity41 ’s head athletics coach hours before she begins the defence of her @entity44 100m hurdles title			1
@entity45 , 27 , was fined by @entity46 for missing a pre-games training camp but @entity48 labelled her ‘ a bad example to the entire national team ’			0
the pair have not spoken since falling out in march			2
at loggerheads : @entity37 and @entity48 @entity48 , though , faces suspension or even the sack for his comments , with @entity46 deeply upset by his actions			1
meanwhile , a man detained by police over an altercation at the athletes ’ village early yesterday morning is believed to be a member of the @entity41 team			1
@entity66 ’s @entity65 made the 200m semi-finals after getting some added motivation from his @entity2 opponent , @entity69			1
he said : ‘ it was quite easy but i was nervous as i was up at 6.55am and i hate early mornings			0
that clown ( @entity72 ) on the outside gave me the motivation because he was making noise in the call room			0
‘ you should n’t do that because that makes me run faster			0
as long as he does that in the semi-final then i ’m going to get him			0
’ the semis are from 6.25pm			0
feisty : @entity65 ( right ) and @entity69 in their 200m heat @entity86 from @entity87 , 21 , did n’t quite live up to his sensational name in the men ’s 200m heats			1
he had the slowest reaction time and finished last — or 007th — in 22.39secs			0
maybe he should have entered the shooting instead ... @entity93 might have found himself a new sport			0
the defender seemed to enjoy @entity66 ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity97 in the women ’s hockey , which sealed @entity66 ’s place in the semi-finals			2
‘ i ’m into this hockey , ’ he tweeted			0
‘ i wish our refs communicated like these hockey refs ! ’ he also approved of @entity66 ’s prowess in front of goal : ‘ @entity109 — what a goal ! @entity112			2
’ @entity97 's @entity113 had quite a lot to live up to at the diving centre			0
the 17 - year - old ’s grandfather sir @entity116 , who turned 90 last month , was a diver at the @entity44 in 1950 , 1954 and 1958 , and he won gold medals in all three			1
with the pressure on , @entity116 the younger could only manage a 9th - place finish in the 1m springboard yesterday , but he does have another chance to emulate his grandfather and add to the family haul in the 3m springboard .			1
