by @entity0 published : 08:36 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 10:06 est , 5 march 2014 owners of a nursery school have installed a @entity5 system so worried parents can check their children are happy while they are at work			1
@entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , gives parents a login address and password so they can view their children 's room for up to five minutes at a time to reassure themselves that their children are ok			1
the webcams can be accessed from a computer or smartphone , and while parents are not subjected to police @entity22 checks , they can only log in on days that their children are in nursery			1
reassuring : parents at @entity25 in @entity10 in @entity11 can check up on their children via webcam - here student @entity26 , four , shows how the system works the nursery caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11 - year - olds , who use the after - school club sisters @entity33 and @entity34 , who run the nursery in @entity10 , in @entity11 , say the babycam is there to give parents peace of mind			1
mrs @entity34 , 50 , who also runs two other nurseries in @entity11 and one in @entity43 , said all her parents are delighted to have the chance to check up on their children			1
she said : ' i have three children of my own and @entity34 has four so we are quite qualified on the parenting side of things and understand that there is nothing more precious to a parent than their child			2
' it is a huge thing for them to leave their children with us because after all we are strangers at the beginning , so this enables them to log on and watch their children having fun			0
' access to the webcam footage automatically shuts off after five minutes , to avoid parents leaving it playing on their work computer and wandering off , allowing others to view it			2
and staff at the nursery , which caters for up to 35 children aged from three months to 11 years in the after - school club , regularly monitor parents ' usage of it to make sure no - one is accessing it particularly often			0
manager june @entity78 , left , with @entity26 , and co-owner @entity33 , right , say parents are fans of the webcams all - seeing eye : staff at the nursery say they forget the cameras are there - nappies are changed off - camera mrs @entity34 said she first installed a babycam at one of her other nurseries three and a half years ago			1
she said : ' we have n't had one parent complain or say they do n't like it , and why would they ? we have nothing to hide			0
' and she said she did n't ask parents for @entity22 checks before allowing them access ' for one very good reason - all nappy changing , and clothes changing , if necessary , is done off camera			0
' ' we have n't had one parent complain or say they do n't like it and would they ? we have nothing to hide			0
' @entity25 co-owner @entity34 she said her staff had never complained that the cameras meant they could n't slack off , and said everyone forgets the cameras are there			0
mrs @entity34 said many nurseries had private @entity5 systems , visible only to nursery bosses , for security reasons , but insisted allowing parents to view it as well was only a good thing			1
she said : ' there is the occasional squabble that a parent might see and they might ring us up about it but that is rare - i would say it happens only about once a year in all of our nurseries as the children are so happy and busy			0
' the first nursery webcams allowing parents to view their children from outside computers were introduced in @entity136 at the beginning of the century			2
researchers said they were popular as they allowed parents to feel they were ' protecting ' their children , but critics said they were taking the concept of @entity142 too far .			0
