@entity0 better serves ‘ rich , old , white people ’ than those from poor backgrounds , according to the corporation 's director of news @entity2 @entity0 better serves ‘ rich , old , white people ’ than those from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities , its most senior executive has claimed			1
@entity2 , director of news , said the corporation must ‘ redress the balance ’ and cater for all licence fee payers equally			1
mr @entity2 based his claims on research by both the corporation and the broadcasting watchdog @entity18 which says that @entity0 , along with other major news broadcasters , fails to attract young , poor , non-white audiences			1
in a speech yesterday , mr @entity2 said : ‘ there is a real issue of information inequality in this country			1
@entity27 , old , white people are getting a better diet of news than poorer , younger , non-white people			1
’ his comments echo those made by former director - general @entity33 , who in 2001 said the @entity0 was ‘ hideously white ’ and had worse race relations than some police forces			1
however , mr @entity2 came under criticism from politicians for declaring that certain audiences have a ‘ better diet ’ of news than others			1
@entity42 mp @entity42 , a member of the @entity43 , called his views ‘ patronising ’			1
she said : ‘ i think he needs to define his terms , what does he mean by better ? people get the news they are interested in and that ’s why you get such a wide range of newspapers			2
it ’s all different but i ’m not going to put a value judgment on it			0
‘ it does n’t say much for the @entity0 , with all its claims that it has by far the widest audience of all			0
it sounds a bit patronising but i do n’t really see what his point is			0
people take their news from where they get the news they want in the way that they want it			0
’ mr @entity2 , who earns £ 340,000 for his role at the @entity0 , levelled the criticism at his own organisation during a speech on the future of @entity0 and the corporation ’s restructuring in the digital age			1
mr @entity2 , who earns £ 340,000 for his role at the @entity0 , levelled the criticism at his own organisation during a speech on the future of @entity0 @entity80 , a @entity42 mp and also a member of the culture select committee , said the @entity0 struggles to represent audiences from poorer backgrounds because it is dominated by wealthy men			1
he said : ‘ i suppose as a @entity0 executive , [ mr @entity2 ] would be a bit of an expert on older , white males , who permeate and dominate the senior echelons of the @entity0			1
my problem sometimes with the @entity0 when they talk about diversity is that they talk about diversity through a rather metropolitan , elite prism			0
‘ they think they will make their organisation more diverse if they can get some black privately educated men as well as some white privately educated men			0
‘ [ these comments ] seem to be an all - encompassing caricature of the problem			0
i think it ’s a challenge for all broadcasters but i think the @entity0 has a particular responsibility because it is funded by the licence fee			0
’ in his speech , mr @entity2 said the @entity0 is working hard to improve diversity both on and off screen			1
he said : ‘ we are also going to keep on when it comes to diversity , disability and equality in the @entity0 : we have made real progress in the past year , on screen and off it but , to my mind , it ’s not enough			2
we ’re going to have to go further , faster			0
‘ we need to make sure we ’re alive to the interests and concerns of all our audiences			0
we have to broaden the tone of what we do			0
’ a spokesman for @entity0 said : ‘ @entity128 @entity0 audience research suggests that @entity0 typically reaches more people from higher social grades each week than people from lower social grades and that we also reach fewer younger people and fewer people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds			2
that is n’t patronising , it ’s simply a fact – and one that we continually strive to address			0
’ former @entity0 director general @entity138 said the @entity0 was not tackling ' difficult questions ' the @entity0 is failing to address the ‘ awesomely difficult questions ’ facing modern @entity142 such as the threat of radical @entity144 , its former chief said yesterday			2
@entity138 , who was director general from 1992 to 2000 , praised the @entity0 ’s day - to - day news operation but said it ‘ faces a challenge ’ on its current affairs shows which are supposed to give a more considered take on events			1
@entity138 , who oversaw a radical modernisation programme during his time in charge at the @entity0 , said digital journalism had given people access to more information than ever before			2
however , he warned : ‘ what it is not creating is more quality journalism			0
we get more knowledge of things happening around the world but pulling it all together and addressing the big policy questions – what should we be doing in respect of radical @entity144 , the @entity166 – that ’s what we ’re not doing very well and nobody ’s doing very much			0
’ he added that the @entity0 must ‘ get back to those very high purposes which are appropriate to a publicly funded broadcaster ’ .			2
