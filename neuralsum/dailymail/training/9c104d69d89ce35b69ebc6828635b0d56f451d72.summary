former superintendent @entity0 arriving at the @entity2 inquests in @entity3 yesterday a senior police officer has admitted ' profound regrets ' for not delaying kick - off during the 1989 @entity2 tragedy , but has maintained fans ' drinking contributed to the disaster			1
former superintendent @entity0 told the inquests into the deaths of 96 @entity13 fans that when he realised the scale of the tragedy he went on ' auto - pilot because i linked the awful events on the terraces directly with my opening of the gates '			1
he also told the inquest into the events of the @entity24 semi-final between @entity13 and @entity26 that asking for the 3pm kick - off to be put back was an option open to him			1
he told the jury of seven women and four men sitting in @entity3 : ' i could certainly have requested a delay of kick - off			1
' i can tell you that it was one of the most profound regrets of my experience at @entity39 on the 15th of april that i did not do so			1
' he said he made four radio requests from 2.47pm onwards to the police control box for three exit gates at the @entity39 turnstiles of @entity46 's ground to be opened amid his fears ' somebody would be killed if the gates were n't opened '			1
@entity50 was then opened at 2.52pm on the orders of the match commander , chief superintendent @entity53 , with the jury previously hearing that an estimated 2,000 @entity13 fans came through and ' a significant number ' headed for a central tunnel leading to the terraces of pens three and four behind the goal			1
yesterday however , he maintained fans ' drinking was partly to to blame			1
during his patrols outside the stadium before heading to the @entity39 area from 2pm , he had noted a ' carnival atmosphere ' , but there was ' a tremendous amount of drinking going on here , there and everywhere '			1
mr @entity0 said it was people joining the back who were pushing			1
at 2.40pm mr @entity0 climbed on to the parapet of the bridge over the @entity83 and said it was the first time he got ' a really good view ' of the area			2
@entity87 said : ' was this the time you became really anxious ? ' he said : ' the congestion			0
the fact that people were shoving and pushing			2
they did not need to do so but they did			0
' the barrister asked him if he thought at that point the fans were going to get inside the stadium in time for kick - off			1
he said : ' surprisingly , no. they had no chance but at the time i thought possibly they could get in			0
' by 2.46pm mr @entity0 described the scene as ' absolute bedlam '			2
mr @entity0 said he did not accept he had mistaken his description of fans pushing and shoving for involuntary surges in the crowd			1
fans at @entity2 spill out over the terraces during the 1989 tragedy victims of the disaster are stretchered across the pitch			1
ninety - six people died in the tragedy @entity13 players pictured leaving the field after the game was called off due to problems in the crowd he repeated that it was ' a battle which we could not possibly win '			2
he said : ' we just did not have the numbers of police officers			2
neither did we have the co-operation of fans at that stage at all			2
' mr @entity0 said he thought ' some of the fans were determined to enter the stadium come what may ' - not all , he said , but ' a substantial minority '			1
he recalled a colleague outside the turnstiles urging him to open the exit gates but he was initially reluctant			1
he explained : ' here we have got a very , very substantial minority under the influence of drink , pushing and shoving without any sort of mutual respect for anybody else , without any self - discipline and really determined to get into the stadium			1
' i thought that , well , if we open the gates this substantial minority is going to end up inside the stadium ... causing a public order issue			2
some of them may not have had tickets , i do n't know			0
an indeterminate number would not have had tickets			0
certainly a minority of them had far too much to drink			0
a young @entity13 fan looks at tributes left at the @entity2 25th @entity161 in april ' close behind that was the absolute imperative of doing something about the situation outside because it was plain to me that unless i did something about it , people would be killed			2
' the barrister asked if he considered upon reflection that he had made mistakes before he climbed up the parapet of the bridge			0
mr @entity0 replied : ' of course i made mistakes			2
i was in the present			0
i could not see into the future			0
' i was doing my absolute utmost and very best to manage an increasingly deteriorating situation and as time progressed what options had i got left ? ' he added : ' as time progressed i am sorry to say that the co-operation ( of the fans ) was not evident			0
neither was self - discipline			0
neither was self - control			0
neither was a mutual respect for anybody else and these are the sorts of things we value in this country			0
' ms @entity199 asked : ' do you think you could have and should have done more ? ' fans hold up scarves during the memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of @entity2 at @entity206 stadium , in april this year mr @entity0 replied : ' i think you can always say you could do more ... i was in an unprecedented situation there			1
i was doing my absolute best			0
i was not standing around with my hands in my pockets			0
' disasters do n't happen in my view because of one individual or a group of individuals have not done their best			0
disasters happen because lots and lots of different factors all come together just at their own time and this is what we got , sadly			0
' referring to his comments about @entity13 supporters , @entity229 , representing some of the bereaved families , said to the witness : ' i am not going to suggest to you that all of the supporters acted as though they were on some kind of church outing but your references to the behaviour of @entity13 fans are simply offloading responsibility , are n't they ? ' ' no , ' replied the witness			0
