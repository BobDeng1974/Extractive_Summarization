a @entity5 - based designer has created a coffee table that doubles up as a levitating magic carpet			2
the impressive design is the brainchild of @entity11 - based artist @entity10 who has launched an optical illusion furniture range inspired by his childhood fairy tales			1
designer @entity10 has created this pixelated ' magic carpet ' rug as part of its optical illusion furniture range the designer set about inventing the magic carpet after watching @entity22 and thinking : ‘ how can i get that into my home ? ’ the digitally - printed table , which costs £ 1,495 , features a pixelated @entity26 rug design with a shadow design on its base			1
' i did n't want to have to resort to using supernatural powers or industrial magnets , ' mr @entity10 told @entity32			0
the illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm - wide leg at the centre of the table			1
a shadow base , shown in these images in black , makes the table appear as though it is floating another one of mr @entity10 's designs is the £ 2,495 @entity43 , inspired by the @entity45 fairy tale ' @entity46 ' , as the imagined furniture of the woodsman the illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm - wide cantilever at the centre of the table			1
a shadow base makes it appear as though it is floating			1
it also has a wave - like surface to add to the illusion of a magic carpet moving in its stationary position			1
unless you lie down on the floor next to the table , you wo n’t know how it works , said mr @entity10			2
' the solution came from one of our previous designs , the shadow chair which was launched a year or two before			0
' the table works in a similar way by a cantilever against the shadow base			1
' this way we can keep the legs and framework very well hidden under the table top , we are able to maximise this using the latest cad technology and 3d design programmes , to push these effects and materials to their limits			2
' the illusion works from all angles both sitting and standing , the wave effect is also an optical illusion caused by the pixelated @entity26 rug pattern and form , the table top is actually completely flat			1
' ' our designs often play with the theme of gravity , which rings true with the mind - boggling creation of the " @entity95 " coffee table , ' said the @entity97 graduate the designer has also created a four poster table structure that uses its structure to suspend eight chairs that sway playfully ' we 've had interest from offices , hotels and homes , ' said mr @entity10			1
' they really love the quirky furniture			0
