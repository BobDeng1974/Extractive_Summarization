it comes after a preview for the programme , this is @entity4 , was uploaded on to @entity14 this week			2
the promotion , showing bare bottoms , screaming rows and foul language , has already been viewed more than 400,000 times			1
but more than 1,000 people have now signed a petition calling for producer @entity34 to abandon plans to broadcast the series			1
petition organiser @entity38 said : ‘ this show does not show the true @entity4 , just a very small minority of idiots who are trying to use it as a platform to become famous			2
‘ you are depicting @entity4 to be something that it is not			0
‘ you are destroying the image of our great city , that we 've all worked hard to change for the better			0
’ the trailer for the show , uploaded on to @entity14 this week , has been viewed more than 400,000 times but more than 1,000 people have now signed a petition calling for producer @entity34 to abandon plans to broadcast the series petition organiser @entity38 said : ' this show does not show the true @entity4 , just a very small minority of idiots who are trying to use it as a platform to become famous ' meanwhile , mayor of liverpool @entity21 told the @entity23 he would n’t expect the programme to win any @entity25 , suggesting it was more of a ‘ comedy ’ than a serious documentary			1
he said : ‘ i was n’t impressed at all with what i 've seen and i think people are absolutely right , it does rely on old stereotypes about @entity4			2
’ the trailer includes videos of two people ’s bottoms on the show , and includes phrases such as , ‘ i ’m f * * * * * * speaking to you – get off this site ’ , ‘ she wo n’t know whether she ’s coming or f * * * * * * going when i ’m finished with her ’ and ‘ i ’ve had a sex change … i was born a boy ’			1
the trailer includes lines such as : ' i 've had a sex change ... i was born a boy ' one supporter of the campaign , @entity91 , said : ‘ it reinforces the idea that we 're all hostile and confrontational , which obviously is n't the case and is a stereotype we 've worked so hard to live down and prove wrong			0
‘ it seems like a huge step backwards to undo all of that just so a small group of people can have 15 minutes of fame			0
’ @entity104 said : ‘ it embodies everything that is wrong with television today and lowers the iq of anyone who watches it			0
‘ the person who thought that this was a good idea should not be allowed to make decisions on their own !			0
another quote in the programme 's @entity14 trailer is : ' she wo n't know whether she 's coming or f * * * * * * going when i 'm finished with her ' this character is heard saying : ' i 'm f * * * * * * speaking to you - get off this site '			1
