the girl died 10 months later			0
@entity15 district judge @entity14 acknowledged in his ruling that it 's rare to release someone from custody who already has been convicted - even as they wait on an appeal of their original conviction			1
according to the @entity42 , the judge ruled that based on the new evidence , ' no reasonable juror ' would convict @entity13 of first degree murder , and that the evidence is so compelling that he is taking the unusual step of releasing @entity13 on bond as her appeal in state court is pending , which could take years			1
' @entity13 should not have to wait in custody for this claim to be exhausted in the state courts , ' @entity14 said			2

much of the prosecution 's case relied on the testimony of a pediatrician who determined that the injuries the girl suffered could only have been suffered on the day she was left with @entity13			0
the judge ruled that the doctor ignored evidence that showed the girl suffered an unexplained brain injury days earlier			2
additionally , judge @entity14 referred to a memo written by the lead detective investigating the baby 's death who worried that the pathologist who conducted the autopsy did n't believe the baby had suffered shaken baby syndrome - a fact that would hurt the prosecution 's case against @entity13			1
new evidence shows that there is nothing to support the prosecution 's theory that the only time the baby could have been injured was while she was in @entity13 's care some of the new evidence was discovered by students involved in the @entity105 at @entity106			0
