call centre staff working for @entity1 were told to ' play the system ' and mislead customers who contacted them with complaints about being mis - sold payment protection insurance			1
an undercover investigation at the group 's largest @entity9 complaint handling centre at @entity12 in @entity13 discovered that staff were told to ignore fraud and assume that @entity9 was never mis - sold			1
workers were also allegedly coached on how to forge information onto customers ' loan agreements and some were advised that customers would drop their complaint after being rejected			1
the latest scandal to hit the bank was unveiled after an undercover reporter from the @entity27 newspaper went through the recruitment and training system			1
call centre staff working for @entity1 were found to be forging information relating to customers ' @entity9 complaints a spokesman for @entity1 conceded that there were ' issues ' with the way it dealt with the scandal and said that it terminated its contract with @entity42 which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf			1
' earlier this year we became aware of issues at a @entity9 complaints handling centre called @entity12 in central @entity13 , ' the spokesman said			1
' this site was operated for us by a third party supplier , @entity42			1
following further investigations , we took immediate action , and in may concluded our contract with @entity42 and moved to a new supplier			1
@entity1 said the comments of trainers to an undercover reporter ' do not reflect ' the banks standards or policies ' some of the comments made by trainers to the @entity27 reporter are not endorsed by @entity1 and we believe they do not reflect our high training standards or our policies			1
' we believe the comments to be isolated and they are now being addressed			0
' following the discovery of these issues , and under the guidance of a new supplier , the employees are currently undergoing re-training in line with our policies and procedures			0
' a spokesman for @entity42 said : ' @entity42 ’s role was to process @entity9 mis - selling complaints from @entity1 ( @entity1 ) customers who were sold policies by the bank , in accordance with the bank ’s policies and procedures			1
' we can not , however , comment upon the specifics of this matter due to reasons of client confidentiality			2
' city regulator the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) said it is aware of the issues raised by @entity27 and it has been working with @entity1 since earlier this year to ensure they are resolved and customers ' interests are properly considered			1
the @entity90 has previously said that it was looking into @entity9 firms ' complaint - handling procedures and it plans to publish its findings later this summer			1
a statement from the @entity90 said : ' we expect all firms to comply with our rules and treat their customers fairly			0
' firms know that @entity9 complaints must be thoroughly investigated and that appropriate action , where required , is taken promptly			1
' our rules are very clear that firms are expected to learn from previous complaints			0
so if there are significant numbers of complaints coming in about the same thing , that is a clear warning sign that something is n't right			0
' former boss @entity113 ( left ) blamed bogus claimants for pushing up the compensation bill earlier this year while current chief executive @entity116 apologised for the scandal describing it as ' unacceptable ' @entity9 is the most complained - about product the @entity119 , which resolves disputes between consumers and financial firms , has ever seen			1
it has criticised banks and insurers for subjecting customers to ' delays and inconvenience ' and has had to deal with record numbers of complaints over the last year , which have mainly been driven by the @entity9 scandal			1
people paid @entity9 on loans they received from many high street banks including @entity1			1
the payment was optional but it was found that it may have been mis - sold because customers may never have wanted it , they were ineligible because they were self - employed or they simply could not afford it			1
customers complained to @entity1 for compensation but were dealt with by @entity139			1
the latest issue is that staff were allegedly told to ignore risk of fraud , reject complaints because 90 per cent of customers did not appeal , or to deal with complaint even if documents are missing			1
of those who did go on to appeal , 84 per cent of complaints were upheld while just 16 per cent were rejected			0
@entity1 said that it had terminated its contract with @entity42 which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf @entity9 covers repayments on credit cards and loans if the holder loses his or her job or is unable to work due to an accident or illness			1
to date @entity1 has set aside a total of £ 6.7 billion for @entity9 redress and paid out more than £ 4.3 billion to 1.3 million customers			1
earlier this year disgraced former @entity1 boss @entity113 launched an astonishing attack on the bank 's customers , blaming bogus @entity9 claims for pushing up the compensation bill			1
@entity113 – who is widely blamed for steering @entity1 to the brink of collapse in 2008 – said up to half of claims on payment protection insurance policies were ' completely illegitimate '			1
in a rare public appearance since retiring from the bailed - out bank almost two years ago , the @entity174 also insisted that the bank carried out ' good due diligence ' on its disastrous takeover of @entity180 during the financial crisis			2
he told the banking commission of mps and peers he was ' deeply regretful ' about customers who were genuine victims of mis - selling , but blamed dishonest claimants for pushing up the compensation bill			1
and he offered no apology for the debacle , claiming @entity9 was ' good value for money '			2
he said : ' in the great majority of cases customers received a good sales process , and received a product that suited them			2
' however , his predecessor @entity116 went on to describe @entity9 mis - selling as ' unacceptable ' becoming the first bank chief executive to apologise			1
the bank was fined £ 4.3million in february after the @entity201 found it was not paying victims swiftly enough			0
there was one complaint every six seconds about @entity9 mis - selling by high street banks last year two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the @entity119 in the past year – a rate of one every six seconds			1
the service went on to investigate a record 500,000 complaints and ordered payouts to nearly 250,000 consumers			0
of those complaints taken up by the @entity119 in the financial year to april , 378,699 were about payment protection insurance			0
this figure was double that of the previous 12 months , according to its annual review			0
chief ombudsman @entity222 said dissatisfaction had hit ' record levels '			0
' people are becoming more aware of their rights and less willing to put up with poor customer service , ' she said			2
' too many financial businesses still seem unable to sort out problems themselves , without the ombudsman having to get involved			0
' the high volume of complaints about @entity9 suggests banks are failing to clear a backlog which has built up over several years			2
they are struggling to process refunds for millions of consumers mis - sold policies they did not need alongside loans and credit cards			1
the scandal has led to an estimated bill of £ 15billion for lenders after they were ordered in 2010 to pay back premiums			2
the ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers , and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank			0
its annual report is another setback for banks , which have been mired in scandal since the 2008 credit crunch			2
@entity259 , founder of financial advice website @entity260 , said : ' financial giants prove time and again they 're little more than shady salesmen masquerading as pillars of society , who routinely reject complaints they 're subsequently forced to settle			0
' continued financial mis - selling , coupled with an increasing willingness to complain , means the latest ombudsman figures are sadly no surprise			1
' the regulator needs to get far tougher by nipping bad practices in the bud , rather than relying on the ombudsman to sort out the mess further down the line			0
' chief ombudsman @entity222 said dissatisfaction with banks had hit ' record levels ' the report also showed a huge rise in the number of pensioners turning to the @entity119 as a last resort			0
the over- 65s accounted for a quarter of cases investigated – double the figure for 2011 - 12			2
however , more consumers are side - stepping claims management firms , which typically grab around 25 per cent of any compensation won			2
miss @entity222 said growing numbers were ' realising they do n't need to pay someone to make a complaint on their behalf '			0
the @entity299 banking groups still dominate complaints			0
@entity302 / @entity301 , @entity1 ( including @entity180 ) , @entity303 and @entity304 accounted for 62 per cent of complaints to the service , up from 52 per cent in the previous period			2
leading institutions are still trying to recover from a string of high - profile scandals over the last year			2
@entity302 / @entity301 suffered an it system meltdown which left customers without access to their cash for weeks			0
bankers at @entity303 and its rivals were strongly implicated in the interest - rate rigging furore while @entity304 was reprimanded for links to money laundering by @entity321 drug barons			2
a spokesman for the @entity323 said : ' all banks have hired more staff to deal with complaints			0
' he criticised some ' unscrupulous ' claims management firms for referring ' large numbers of claims to the @entity119 , whether there are grounds to or not '			0
this ' clogs up the system , meaning that people with genuine complaints do n't always get the service they deserve '			0
if you are thinking about ditching your bank there are plenty of incentives to move			0
this is @entity346 's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are			0
top deals include @entity351 's @entity350 promises new customers £ 100 to switch and £ 5 per month if they stay in credit			0
@entity354 pays £ 100 to new customers who switch to its @entity355			0
on top of that , the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £ 100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months			2
@entity365 's 123 current account , on the other hand , pays interest on in - credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 , 2 per cent between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £ 3,000 and £ 20,000			0
