by @entity0 published : 07:50 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 08:51 est , 4 march 2013 a student who piled on the pounds after gorging on takeaways at university has lost three stone and become a fitness instructor - after taking up pole dancing			1
@entity7 , 22 , tipped the scales at 13 stone and was mortified after doctors told her she was obese when she went for a check - up last january			1
she ballooned in weight after snacking on a student diet of crisps , chocolate and takeaways while studying computer systems at @entity18			2
less than 12 months later she has lost three stone and dropped from a frumpy size 16 to a svelte size 10 for the first time in her life			2
and today @entity7 - who is now a fitness instructor - said that shedding the weight was thanks to pole dancing			1
she said : ' in january last year i went to see the doctor and she weighed me and did the @entity37 check and said i was obese			2
@entity7 decided to diet after a doctor told her she was obese when she tipped the scales at 13 stone in janauary last year ' it was definitely a shock			1
i wish somebody had said something to me when i was gaining a bit of weight			2
' i think i 've always been a little bit bigger but when i did go to university it was crisps and chocolate and eating takeaways instead of proper meals			0
' i started pole dancing and found i was able to do some of the moves and had a bit of a natural talent for it			1
' it never crossed my mind as something i wanted to do but my friend did it for her 21st birthday party and that 's when i got into it			0
' i had in the back of my mind to get into a size 10 dress for my graduation in november and i was thrilled when i did it			0
@entity7 , who studied @entity70 at @entity18 , had ballooned to a bigger frame by snacking on a student diet of crisps , chocolate and takeaways ' i joined the pole dancing society at university and then when i finished i joined my local pole dancing studio			1
' i go once a week on a friday and do an intermediate class with my friend			0
' it is quite a rigorous workout for the whole body			0
it works almost every single muscle			0
' i enjoy it a lot more now			0
to do the moves you have to show a little skin because it is all about skin to pole contact			1
' when i was first starting going upside down and showing a bit of belly i would quickly roll my top up to go on the pole but then quickly roll it down when i finished			1
' but now i 'm more body confident and happy to wear crop tops and hot pants			0
' for me exercise has to be fun			0
' @entity7 , who has been inspired to become a fitness instructor after her weight loss , said that shedding the stones was thanks to regular exercise on the pole since losing the weight , @entity7 , who lives with her parents in @entity111 , @entity112 , has even won a competition at @entity114 where she goes once a week			1
she has even gained the confidence to make her own pole dancing video to enter into the @entity118 championships in april this year			1
@entity7 has also continued to lose the weight by eating healthily after joining her local @entity119 - which she now runs			1
she added : ' i feel a lot more confident since losing the weight			0
' i probably would n't have entered such a big competition if i was bigger			2
' i 'm sure i would still be able to do the moves if i was 13 stone but it 's got to be easier now and i am definitely a lot fitter than i was			0
' i want to inspire other people to lose weight			0
