a city in @entity1 is battling a plague of crows with swarms estimated to be 60,000 - strong - meaning there 's almost one bird to every human inhabitant			1
residents , business owners and police in @entity12 have joined together in a bid to get rid of the ' dirty ' birds , which leave droppings everywhere and create noise pollution			1
volunteer armies have been brandishing lasers at the buildings from dusk until early night , while a biologist also recommended using sound machines			2
' the crows adapted quickly and realized that ’s just a fake , ' @entity41 , ceo of the @entity43 and one of the leaders in the fight against the crows , told the @entity48 ongoing problem : @entity41 , ceo of the @entity43 , is one of the @entity12 residents leading the fight against the crows which leave their droppings all over buildings trouble - makers : the birds ' overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from their waste some have compared the crow - laden landscape to the @entity66 movie @entity67 , where the @entity69 town of @entity70 suddenly becomes the subject of unexplained and violent bird attacks			1
however , the murder of crows troubling @entity12 is n't aggressive like the one in the 1963 thriller			2
but with tens of thousands of them at times , their overwhelming presence on trees and buildings is causing concern about damage and potential health hazards from the birds ' waste			0
@entity41 noted that the stones swallowed by crows to help digest their food have clogged up gutters on buildings and business owners have been paying thousands to get droppings removed			1
here to stay : apparently the crow epidemic in @entity12 has been an ongoing problem reminiscent : the @entity12 scenes are reminiscent of the 1963 @entity66 classic film , @entity67 ( pictured ) @entity96 are now in the midst of a two - week drive to banish the crows for good			0
the city 's service department is employing up to two workers per night during this time to fire flare guns			0
they hope this will convince the birds to choose a roosting place away from the downtown area			0
apparently the crow epidemic has been an ongoing problem for more than a decade in the area			0
but @entity41 concluded : ' we ’ll keep going as long as it takes			2

around 60,000 crows descend on @entity12 , @entity1 , every night
that means there 's almost one bird to every human inhabitant
residents , business owners and police have joined together in a bid to get rid of the ' dirty ' birds , which leave droppings everywhere
they have used laser *pointers* , sound machines and gun flares
' we ’ll keep going as long as it takes , ' @entity41 , ceo of the @entity43 said
