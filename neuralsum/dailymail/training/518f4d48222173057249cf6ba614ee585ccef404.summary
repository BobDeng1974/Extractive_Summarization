by @entity1 reporter six days after a family of four found themselves helpless and adrift in a sailboat far into the @entity5 with a vomiting and feverish 1 - year - old aboard , a @entity8 warship delivered them safely to @entity10 , where they had begun their attempted around - the world voyage before the child was born			1
@entity14 , the 36 - foot sailboat that had been their home for seven years , is at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off @entity20 , sunk by the rescuers because it was taking on water after losing its steering and most of its communications			1
a satellite phone ping from the boat thursday set off a huge rescue effort that began hours later with skydiving @entity28 and involved three federal agencies , a plane , a frigate and scores of personnel before it was through			2
the ship , the @entity39 , docked at @entity58 about 10 a.m. , @entity8 spokeswoman lt. @entity56 said			1
in a photo released by the @entity8 , the family looked like typical vacationers , with father @entity44 dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while lugging bags , and his wife , @entity67 , walking behind him , holding the toddler in a strap - on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3 - year - old daughter			1
the happy scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by @entity8 sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the @entity10 mainland later in the day without the @entity78			0
it was scheduled to move on to the @entity10 mainland later in the day but without the @entity78 , who said they want to tend to their 1 - year - old daughter , @entity46 , first and get some rest before talking publicly , @entity37 's sister , @entity79 , said			1
the @entity78 ' decision to sail around the world with @entity46 and her 3 - year - old sister @entity47 drew accusations of reckless foolishness from some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit			1
sailors from the frigate @entity39 assist in the rescue of the @entity37 family with a sick infant on the ship 's small boat ' they 'll probably go on the ' today ' show to talk about this , and write a book about it , do a miniseries and get 15 minutes of fame because that 's how our country tends to reward people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in danger , ' said @entity110 , a @entity10 novelist who has three children			1
@entity112 does n't question the decision of her sister 's family			0
she said sailing is their passion			0
it 's what defines them			0
' @entity67 and @entity44 raise their children how they see fit , ' @entity79 said			2
' they are very concerned about child safety			0
that 's their no. 1 concern , and they did not do this blindly			0
they are responsible , good parents			0
' but they are aware of the criticism			0
@entity132 , a @entity134 - licensed captain , and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their actions , saying ' when we departed on this journey more than a year ago , we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could			1
' others said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them the world , even when they 're too young to remember it			2
the @entity14 sailboat , carrying the @entity37 family , became the site of a @entity8 rescue sunday @entity154 said the @entity78 should be commended			2
' i think it 's a great thing , their decision to sail around the world , and just because their children are 1 and 3 years old does n't mean they ca n't be on a boat , ' said @entity162 , of @entity10 , who is also planning a world trip with his wife and two daughters , 8 and 10			1
' it 's just too bad what happened , but that 's also life			0
anything can happen , anywhere			0
' four @entity173 members parachuted to the sailboat thursday and stabilized @entity46 , who responded well to medication for @entity178 - like symptoms until the warship arrived sunday			1
she had previously had salmonella in @entity20 , where the family had stopped their voyage for her birth , but her pediatrician assured them she was recovered and could travel , @entity79 said			2
but shortly into the trip , the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics .			0

@entity67 and @entity132 deny they put their 1 - year - old girl @entity46 in danger by taking her on their round - the - world trip
@entity39 was sent in to help *airlift* one - year - old @entity197 to safety after parents raised the alarm on thursday
sailors helped the family onto an *inflatable* raft and then took them aboard the warship around 8 am local time sunday
@entity46 is now recovering nicely . family believe she had a *relapse* of salmonella *poisoning*
