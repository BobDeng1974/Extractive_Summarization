elephant man : the offender , who used a grey t - shirt with two eye holes cut out to cover his head , escaped with around £ 350 after threatening staff at a coral store in @entity12 , @entity13 disguise : staff locked themselves in a back office as the man , who was also wearing mustard - coloured trousers , stole the money from behind the counter and ran off at around 4:45pm on january 26 detective constable @entity34 , from the @entity35 of @entity36 , said : ‘ this is one of the most unusual masked robbers we have encountered			1
‘ he can only be described as looking like the elephant man			0
it ’s surprising he was able to see anything at all through this make - shift mask			0
‘ however this was a disturbing incident for the members of staff who did the right thing by securing their safety and contacting police			0
we are appealing to members of the public to help us find the man responsible			0
@entity56 ' freak ' : the real - life elephant man was @entity59 ( left ) was believed to have suffered from @entity60			1
the robber used the disguise to take £ 350 from this coral store ( right ) in @entity12 , @entity13 with the mask : a scene from the 1980 film @entity4 starring @entity67 as @entity59 ‘ there would have been a number of people in and around the area at the time of the robbery and we particularly want to hear from anyone who saw the man entering or leaving the shop , or anyone with any other information that can help us to identify him			1
’ the real - life @entity4 was @entity59 , born in @entity80 in 1862 , who was believed to have suffered from @entity60 , which causes thickening and enlargement of the skin and tissue			1
his skeleton has been preserved at a hospital since his death at the age of 27 in 1890 after a life of being regarded as a freak in @entity56 society , and in 1980 a film was made about his condition			2
in 2001 there was speculation that , rather than @entity60 , mr @entity59 suffered from a rare disease called @entity96 which causes skin overgrowth and abnormal bone development			2
mr @entity59 was born apparently healthy , but as he grew up his lips thickened and a bony lump grew on his forehead			0
the weight of his head forced him to sleep sitting up and his speech was slurred			0
mr @entity59 used to disguise his disfigured face with a hat and mask to avoid attracting attention .			0
