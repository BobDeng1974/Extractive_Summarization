by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 has said it would be wrong to quit as captain in the middle of @entity6 's series against @entity7 - despite leading his side to yet another defeat at @entity10			1
senior player @entity11 stood down on monday night from the team for the summer to have @entity14 surgery			0
but @entity1 insisted he is still the right man to lead his country after @entity6 collapsed horribly on the final afternoon of the second test to crash to a 95 - run defeat and gift @entity7 only their sixth win in this country in 82 years			1
' five days is a long time in sport and i 'm still here			0
i still want to throw it all in to be captain			0
i 've still got the determination			0
if we win and i score runs , things do change			0
' when i was made captain i said to my wife i was going to give it my all			0
the team needs me to lead them through this tough time but not if it gets to the stage where i am not scoring runs by the end of the series			1
to quit now would be wrong			2
' wicket - keeper prior revealed : ' i 'm not doing justice to myself and more importantly the team and that is what matters first and foremost			2
i tore my quad before the first test and my right hand has been beaten to a pulp , but the main issue is the @entity14			2
i 've always said as long as i can do my job i will manage the pain and get on with it , but it has now got to the point where i ca n't do my job to the level i expect of myself			0
' issues at the crease : and his batting form has suffered badly as well in recent times dip : he is without a century now in 27 innings , and is averaging just 14 this year @entity6 have lost seven and won none of their last @entity77 - their worst sequence in over two decades - while @entity1 is without a century in 27 innings and averaging 14 this year			1
to compound a miserable day for the captain , axed batsman @entity79 once again declared his desire to make an international comeback and claimed his presence might have helped @entity6			1
in an interview with @entity85 , @entity79 said : ' i 'd love to play for @entity6 again but we might just have to wait for a few things to change before that could happen			1
