@entity0 needs to become more selfish if he wants to be considered alongside @entity1 and @entity2 , according to @entity4 legend @entity3			1
the @entity6 playmaker is closing in on a first @entity8 title after another impressive season , which has seen him emerge as favourite to pick up the @entity12 award			1
despite scoring 13 goals and making eight assists in 32 appearances , @entity3 believes the 24 - year - old needs to be more ruthless to be compared with the world 's best players			1
@entity0 celebrates scoring the winner against @entity4 as @entity6 close in on the title the @entity6 playmaker is favourite to pick up the @entity12 award this season @entity1 ( left ) and @entity2 are recognised as the world 's two best players - ahead of @entity0 ' one thing i do wonder with @entity0 is whether he has that hunger to score goals that you see in @entity1 , @entity2 and [ @entity29 ] @entity28 , ' @entity3 wrote in @entity30			1
' those are players who have a ferocious appetite to put the ball in the net			0
hazard seems to me to be a relatively gentle soul			0
one who is just as happy skipping past a couple of opponents and putting it on a plate for a team - mate			0
' he does that very well , and i have no doubt he will deserve his accolade at the @entity12 awards			0
playing the way he does , under pressure to score goals and make them , is not easy and he has been a big part of @entity6 's success			0
' but in this modern age , if he wishes to challenge the achievements of @entity2 and @entity1 then he will have to prove that he can match their relentless desire to score goals			2
' @entity6 fans show their appreciation for the @entity60 international at @entity62 former @entity4 midfielder @entity3 ( right ) believes @entity0 needs to be more ruthless nonetheless , @entity3 says he would vote for hazard as @entity12 ahead of @entity65 striker @entity64 - who has netted 30 goals in all competitions during his breakthrough season			1
@entity4 goalkeeper @entity69 , @entity71 's @entity70 , @entity73 midfielder @entity72 and @entity0 's team - mate @entity74 are also in the running			1
' my vote would go to @entity0 , ' @entity3 added			2
' i prefer the attacking footballers – you would n't expect me to say otherwise – and @entity0 has been the best in that regard			0
' not streets ahead of the likes of @entity64 , and nothing like the wow - factor of those two big players at @entity87 and @entity88			0
but @entity0 has made the difference in big games , like the one against @entity4			2

@entity6 travel to @entity71 as they close in on the @entity8 title
@entity0 has scored 13 goals during another impressive season
*ex-man* @entity4 star @entity3 says @entity0 needs to be more ruthless
