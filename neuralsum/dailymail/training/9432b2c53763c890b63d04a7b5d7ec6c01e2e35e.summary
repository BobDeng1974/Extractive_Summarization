these stunning images reveal that even in the most inhospitable of environments , life can thrive - and create incredibly beautiful effects as it does			0
the images show ice bubbles in @entity6 , located at the foot of the @entity8 in @entity9			1
the rare phenomenon occurs each winter in the man - made lake , as the plants on the lake bed release methane gas , which freezes as it comes closer to the cold lake surface			1
ice bubbles in @entity6 , located at the foot of the @entity8 in @entity9			1
the bubbles are created from methane released by plants in the lake , which freezes as it rises through the lake ice bubbles occur during the months of november and march when the lake is completely frozen over			1
the plants on the lake bed release methane gas , which freezes as it comes closer to the cold lake surface			2
the bubbles keep stacking up below the frozen lake once the weather gets colder and colder during the winter season			2
the result is these incredible ice bubbles which are frozen in place as long as the water remains solid			2

the simple nature of the ice bubbles composition makes the images even more remarkable and almost appears to look more like a painting than a photograph			2
but they are in fact taken by a 40 - year - old @entity49 photographer , @entity48 , who simply snapped the results by walking onto the frozen lake			0

' i usually use crampons to avoid slipping but on one of my first trips to the lake , a giant gust of wind came barrelling across the lake , picked me up and threw me back on the ice			0
' i had to carefully walk back to safety ducking along the way to avoid it from happening again			0
' my forehead was bleeding a little , and i think i might have gotten a slight concussion so i am very careful now when i go out			0
