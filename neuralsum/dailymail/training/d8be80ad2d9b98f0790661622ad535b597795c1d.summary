more than 60 million people worldwide suffer from autism , and many struggle to make eye contact and have poor social skills			1
while there is no cure for the condition , the use of technology in autism treatment has grown in popularity in recent years			2
and @entity13 ’s latest @entity12 app uses technology in a way that helps improve eye contact and boost autistic children ’s social skills and facial recognition abilities			1
the team created a series of games , or ‘ missions ’ designed specifically to help children with autism make eye contact , read facial expressions and express their emotions this app was developed by @entity13 , in collaboration with professors , doctors and designers in @entity27			1
the team created a series of games , or ‘ missions ’ designed specifically to help children with autism make eye contact , read facial expressions and express their emotions			1
for example , one game uses the front - facing camera to place the child ’s face within a frame and take an image			0
this is thought to improve facial recognition and spatial awareness			1
autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person communicates , and relates to , other people			2
it can also affect how they make sense of the world around them			2
people with autism typically have trouble communicating , looking people in the eye , and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights			1
they may also have a sensitivity to touch , tastes , smells and colours			0
in particular , many autistic people like order and predictability			0
autism is a spectrum condition , which means that while all people with autism share certain difficulties , their condition affects them in different ways			2
some people with autism , for example , are able to live relatively independent lives but others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist support			2
asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence			2
they have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language			0
another game places faces of other people in small dots over a person ’s eyes			0
the child has to identify which person ’s face appears in the dot from a selection			0
this also teaches facial recognition , as well as the ability to pick up clues by focusing on a person ’s eyes , explained the firm			1
a third game asks the child to identify happy and sad faces from a line - up			0
this was designed to help autism sufferers recognise emotions			1
for each correct answer , the users receive character cards and points , while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games			1
during tests , 20 children were trained on the app over an eight - week period and 60 per cent of them showed a noticeable improvement			1
professor @entity142 from the @entity143 at @entity144 said : ‘ this program will help children with autism improve their social skills and relationships			1
’ paediatric psychologist @entity150 from @entity151 added : ‘ another benefit is that it is effective in encouraging a triangulation communication system , where children with autism can communicate with other people with the aid of a device			1
@entity13 ’s @entity12 app is n’t the first to use technology in this way			1
@entity163 in @entity164 , for example , creates apps aimed primarily at children aged between three and six			0
@entity167 encourages children to make music and learn about rhythm and tempo , while @entity172 lets players give their family and friends virtual haircuts			1
one game uses the front - facing camera to place the child ’s face within a frame and take an image ( pictured )			0
this improves facial recognition and spatial awareness			1
during tests , 60 % of the children who used the app for eight weeks showed a noticeable improvement in these social skills another games asks the child to identify happy and sad faces from a line - up ( pictured )			1
this game was designed to help autism sufferers recognise emotions and learn clues about emotions from people 's faces the firm calls the characters in the apps ‘ digital toys ’ and although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism , they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition			1
@entity212 , 32 , from @entity213 has been a speech and language therapist for eight years			0
she began using technology in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months ago			0
‘ technology responds in the same way every time ; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to , ' @entity219 told @entity226			0
' this particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability			0
' for each correct answer , the children receive character cards and points , while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games			1
the free @entity239 app is compatible with @entity13 ’s @entity240 , @entity240 and @entity241 , @entity242 and zoom range , and the @entity244 many autistic children like trains , for example , because they are predictable			1
they follow set paths along stable tracks and their doors open and close in the same way each time			0
for therapy to work , ms @entity212 believes it has to be motivating , and technology motivates children with autism in a unique way			1
‘ we know therapy needs to be motivating for children in general , and games are particularly motivating for children with autism because they ’re visually appealing			1
‘ autistic children are n't motivated by wanting to please in the same way other children are			0
‘ non-autistic children think ‘ this lady wants me to play this game and if i do , she 'll say well done , ' but autistic children are n’t interested in that at all			0
' they need to be motivated in other ways - and technology helps with this			0
' autistic children typically have visual ways of communicating , and as a result have a visual way of learning and this is why apps are so effective , ms @entity212 concluded			0
in a recent study , researchers from @entity286 studied 12 children in six classrooms across @entity290 , all of whom have non-verbal autism spectrum disorder			2
these classrooms were given @entity293 for a six - month trial			0
following the experiment , nine of the students showed a statistical improvement ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills			2
the devices were also found to boost motivation among 75 per cent of the children , while also increasing their attention span and ability to interact socially			0
@entity305 in @entity306 recently introduced touchscreen devices into classrooms and similarly noticed an improvement among the autistic students			0
‘ we watched children with autism playing with the images on the screen in ways in which none of the typically developing children had done , said @entity321 ’s spectrum disorders teacher @entity319			2
‘ the normal curriculum that we were offering just was n't allowing them to demonstrate these skills to us			0
we never realised that the children had these skills because some of them are so locked in			2

the app was developed by @entity13 with doctors in @entity27
it features games designed to help children with autism make eye contact
games can also improve facial recognition and expressing emotions
in tests , 60 % of children showed noticeable improvements in these skills
free app is compatible with @entity240 , @entity240 and @entity241 plus @entity242 and zoom range and the @entity244
