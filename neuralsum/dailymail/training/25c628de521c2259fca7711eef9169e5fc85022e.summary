here is what sir @entity7 believes @entity0 must do to win the @entity9			1
1 get in the face of opponents it ’s been too cosy around the @entity0 squad for too long			1
@entity14 and his side must be more confrontational			2
@entity0 captain @entity14 ( right ) lines up against his opposite number , @entity3 captain @entity18 2 lead from the front this starts with @entity22 , he must stamp his authority on everything concerning @entity0			1
the players will follow his lead			0
3 @entity28 @entity0 must pack their side with pace			1
it ’s the only thing guaranteed to scare opponents			0
selection against @entity3 is a very good start			0
4 pile on the pressure this @entity0 team need to have a ‘ knockout rugby ’ mindset that every game is their last			1
you only get one chance			0
@entity0 field a new centre combination in @entity5 in the form of @entity45 ( right ) and @entity46 5 increase the number off opportunities players must know a gameplan to score from every position in the opposition third			1
6 win ugly if necessary it ’s all about winning and it does n’t matter how you do it			2
valiant losses count for little			0
7 forget about tomorrow i ’ve heard too much about the @entity58			0
the @entity0 team is not a development side			1
head coach @entity61 must concentrate on this championship and not the @entity58 in september 8 give the players direction this group of players is undoubtedly talented enough to win the @entity58			1
