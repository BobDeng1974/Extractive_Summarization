by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 11:40 est , 23 october 2012 @entity1 has ideas about how he might celebrate his 26th birthday this week			1
first , @entity4 rolls up in a limo and tells him to hop in			2
and later , when the @entity9 rock icon takes the stage and rips into @entity11 , 1,800 of his closest friends go wild			1
far - fetched ? maybe not			2
after a two - year campaign to get his far - flung friends together for a great time , the irrepressible @entity15 man has actually persuaded @entity4 to play his birthday party on friday night			1
hear from the mega-fan below @entity11 : @entity1 , 26 , has convinced 80s icon @entity4 to play at his birthday party on friday in @entity15 ' this is surreal , ' @entity1 says			1
' it should not be happening			2
' so why is it ? in his bedroom , surrounded by @entity26 and @entity27 records , a drumstick he picked up at an @entity4 show two years ago , and rock posters , @entity1 explains : in october 2010 , he had just turned 24 and was having an early life crisis			1
friends were getting married and moving away			2
he was working three jobs and making little progress paying off $ 40,000 in college loans			2
@entity35 came over the stereo at the @entity39 's @entity38 clothing store , where he worked			2
@entity1 turned to a coworker : ' would n't it be cool if we got @entity4 to play at my birthday party ? ' she laughed			1
no way , right ? but he went home and thought about it			2
he loved the way @entity4 blended pop and rock			2
@entity4 seemed like a fun guy			2
rock and roll dreams : @entity4 on stage in @entity57 ( with @entity58 's @entity59 , right ) perseverance : @entity1 with the website where he enlisted the help of friends and celebrities to convince @entity4 to play his party @entity1 loves other music from the ' 80s , but he could n't see @entity67 or @entity68 agreeing			1
@entity4 , who lives in @entity57 , would n't even have to leave his time zone			0
scoring @entity4 could also be a major coup for his resume			0
@entity1 is n't sure what he wants to do for a career - something in entertainment or event planning or @entity77 , maybe - but he thought this could get it started			1
' i 'm like , how feasible is it ? ' he says			0
' i realized it would cost a lot of money , something i do n't have , so that 's where the creativity came into play			2
' how do you network to convince @entity4 that it would be a good idea for him to come play a show on a specific date in @entity15 ? ' the first step was getting a friend , @entity96 , to build him a website - playmybirthdaybillyidol.com			1
' i thought it was never gon na work , ' @entity96 says			0
wannabe : @entity1 himself has a band called @entity101 who play 80s covers the next step was to get people to look at the website			1
@entity1 hauled a boom box through a deserted @entity107 at night , dancing as @entity108 blared , then posted a video of it			1
he and friends held a banner over @entity113			0
but the site did n't start getting much attention until he decided to collect some celebrity endorsements			0
comedian @entity117 came to town to do stand - up , and @entity1 got him on a 12 - second video , telling @entity4 : ' you got ta come to @entity15 next october to do ... ' ' @entity122 prompts			1
' ... @entity1 's birthday			1
it 's gon na be awesome			0
' endorsements from other b - and c - listers followed : musician @entity127 , former @entity129 @entity128 , porn star @entity130			0
hanging out at book signings and other celebrity appearances became a fourth job			0
only @entity134 from @entity135 and comedian @entity136 turned him down			0
local media outlets started to notice			0
and the @entity139 news alerts made their way to @entity4 's people			0
they called @entity1 and told him the campaign was cool , but that they could n't promise anything			1
' when we first became aware of @entity1 's project we were inclined to see it as just another extreme idea from a well - meaning fan , ' " said @entity4 's manager , @entity146			1
tribute : @entity11 , @entity4 's hit track , tops a set list for @entity1 's cover band ' but as @entity1 's campaign continued , his persistence and resourcefulness won @entity4 over			1
' it took a while , though			0
in the meantime @entity1 , who sings , plays guitar and does a passable @entity4 impersonation , put together an ' 80s cover band , @entity101			1
they began playing a series of charity concerts dubbed @entity169 and raised more than $ 10,000 for the @entity170 and @entity171 , which supplies meals to food banks			0
but when october 2011 came around , @entity4 did n't show			0
instead , he sent a video , saying he was sorry he could n't make it - but there was always next year			0
though some friends and family were a bit tired of the project , @entity1 decided to give it one more year			1
he had bimonthly chats with @entity4 's people to update them on his status			0
eventually , the @entity186 , a @entity15 venue that hosted some of the @entity190 events , made an offer to host the event at its location south of downtown			1
finally , last august , @entity4 's people called from @entity195 , where he was touring , and said @entity4 was in , with his band			0
@entity1 says he started screaming and running laps around the mall			1
and when 900 - plus people showed up for @entity201 , they were treated to an official video announcement from the man himself			0
' the people of the world have spoken ! ' @entity4 thundered			0
' the dream will become reality ...			0
' ' it 's gon na be pretty much the coolest night ever , ' says @entity1 , whose birthday was monday			1
' we 'll have as much fun as possible before we get to the 9 - 5 part of my life			0

@entity1 , 26 , campaigned for two years to have the 80s icon play his birthday party in @entity15
