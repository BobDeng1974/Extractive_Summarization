by @entity0 @entity1 said she was with her son all night when quizzed by police after shots were fired in @entity5 , but then it turned out she had been texting him the whole time a mother who gave her son an alibi for a crime he had n’t committed has been locked up for lying to police			1
@entity13 , 20 , walked free from court after prosecutors dropped an attempted murder charge against him following a street shooting			1
but his mother @entity18 , 43 , is now beginning an eight - month jail sentence for her needless effort to keep him out of trouble			1
police called at her home looking for her son minutes after shots were fired at a 37 - year - old man he was feuding with on @entity5 ’s @entity30 estate			1
ms @entity31 , of @entity32 , @entity5 , lied to officers and told them he was at home at the time of the crime , sticking to her story in repeated accounts over several weeks - even after @entity41 evidence proved he was on the street			1
in an ironic twist , the same footage that revealed ms @entity31 had lied about her son ’s whereabouts , leading to her conviction , also cleared him			2
@entity13 was wearing light - coloured clothing on the night of the shooting - and while the victim had identified him as responsible , the shooter was dressed entirely in black			2
last month , on the day he was due to face trial , the @entity52 dropped its case against @entity55 , who had been arrested and charged last year			2
meanwhile , ms @entity31 admitted perverting the course of justice , and has now been jailed for eight months			1
hours before the .32 bullet was fired at him on september 23 , the target of the shooting turned up at the home mr @entity13 shares with his mum armed with two rottweilers , but no - one was in			1
@entity70 @entity69 heard that the two men crossed paths at @entity73 at 9.30pm that night , when mr @entity13 was part of a group of ten men			0
in the stand - off that followed someone shouted ‘ get the ting ’ - meaning get the gun - and a shot was fired at the victim			2
in a text she sent @entity13 , ms @entity31 said : ' i told the police you went out at ten - you were in all day ’			1
he replied with a ‘ smiley face ’ emoticon , saying ‘ luv u mum , ur the best ’			0
@entity89 , defending , said : ' she says she instinctively responded to police in a protective manner to her son			2
' judge @entity93 , said : ' the public must realise that to give false alibis will always be dealt with by prison sentences			2
' @entity1 , pictured left , said she was with her son @entity99 , right , all night when quizzed by police after shots were fired in @entity5 - but @entity70 @entity69 heard she had been texting him the whole time @entity13 insists his mother thought she was telling police the truth			1
that is despite the fact the former office worker , a mother - of - three from @entity110 , pleaded guilty to lying to officers in court			1
@entity31 , 20 , said : ' i did nothing wrong and she did nothing wrong			0
i just feel disgraced by the system			0
she was gobsmacked when she was first arrested and they pursued and pursued the case			0
' my mum did n’t lie intentionally			0
when she told the police i was at home , that was what she believed			1
' i am a grown man i do n’t tell my mum every time i leave the house			0
she thought i was at home			0
' she pleaded guilty because she could n’t take any more of the stress and worry			0
she ’s never been to prison before			0
it ’s upsetting for everyone			0
going to be prison will be a huge ordeal for her			0
' but i know she ’ll cope because she ’s a strong woman			0
' @entity1 , 43 , was jailed for eight months at @entity133 for her needless effort to keep her son out of trouble .			1
