a couple returning from @entity1 found two migrants stowed away in their trailer - next to a hot air balloon			2
@entity5 and @entity6 made the unusual discovery in the car park of @entity10 ' @entity9 as they returned from a summer offering ballooning tours in @entity14			1
they had checked their expansive trailer because of recent headlines over @entity10 ' immigration crisis , but were still stunned to find two resigned - looking men in their late 20s crouched inside			1
flummoxed : @entity21 and his wife found two migrants stowed in their trailer - next to their hot air balloon security : the couple were staying at the @entity9 hotel in @entity10 , whose car park has a low mesh fence the men wandered off without protesting and mr @entity21 , 52 , spent the next 40 minutes combing over the contents of his trailer to make sure no one else had smuggled themselves inside			1
he and his wife , a 46 - year - old graphic designer , spoke out to warn other tourists after their return to their village of @entity42 , @entity43			1
' we checked because last year we came back and the immigration officers pulled us over and searched us , ' he said			2
' then there was the publicity from truck drivers and the like , and my mum said : " make sure you check your trailer ! "			2
' it was still a shock			0
it was still dark and we had noticed the velcro on one of the compartments of the larger trailer was n’t exactly sealed , and the corresponding fastening clips loose but still secure			0
you can imagine our surprise			0
plenty of room : the couple checked inside due to recent headlines - and they had been stopped before ' i just said : " out - you two could have got me into a lot of trouble and cost me a lot of money "			1
' their body language just implied they were going to try again with someone else the next day			0
' the couple found the men , who they said were of @entity80 origin , in the car park of the hotel at around 7am on saturday , october 18			1
many car parks in @entity10 are secure , and although the @entity84 's was not open to the street it had only a basic mesh fence and security gate			2
mr and mrs @entity6 , who had been ballooning in northern @entity90 since may , could have been fined up to £ 2,000 and had their trailer seized if they had not spotted the pair and been stopped by officials			1
they told the hotel about the incident but did not inform @entity1 police because , as mr @entity21 put it : ' that would n't have achieved anything except making us miss our ferry '			1
he added : ' i can see both sides - these people are running away from something awful			0
once they 're in @entity110 they 've escaped what they 're running from , so there should be a @entity110 - wide solution to help them			0
' yesterday @entity10 ' mayor told @entity118 @entity117 was an ‘ @entity121 ’ for thousands of migrants because of generous handouts			0
blaming the @entity117 for the crisis , @entity122 said benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for determined people			0
she said the migrants , many fleeing humanitarian disasters in @entity80 and the @entity132 , were ‘ prepared to die ’ to reach @entity117			0
but @entity134 mp @entity133 hit back at the claims , telling ms @entity122 : ‘ you ca n’t expect us to disadvantage our people because @entity1 ca n’t police its borders			0
’ return : the couple were staying overnight in the @entity1 port town after spending the summer in @entity14 debate : the incident at the hotel ( pictured ) emerged a day after @entity10 ' mayor accused @entity117 of being an ‘ @entity121 ’ for thousands of migrants because of generous handouts and the perceived promise of illegal work			1

@entity21 , 52 , and @entity6 , 46 , had parked in port town 's @entity9
