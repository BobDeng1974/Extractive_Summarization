by @entity0 and @entity1 despite wearing a noticeably longer @entity3 coat and dress on her arrival in @entity6 , the @entity7 still managed to be caught out by a gust of windy weather			1
although the outfit ’s hemline was around three inches lower than normal , it seemed @entity7 still has n’t picked up on the @entity14 ’s trick of sewing lead curtain weights into her outfits			1
no sooner had @entity7 stepped off the plane than she managed to flash a length of shapely thigh			1
@entity20 moment : the @entity7 nearly suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she touched down in @entity23 , @entity24 on monday with prince @entity25 and baby @entity26 @entity7 , pictured here in @entity28 in 2011 , has had trouble with the wind before as she favours shorter dresses @entity32 , a great favourite of the late @entity33 , designed the scarlet coat with two rows of pearlised buttons especially for @entity7 ’s first formal appearance on tour			1
the eye - catching colour and striking style ensured that @entity7 stood out on a grey and blustery day in @entity23			1
it was also the perfect foil for her son ’s all - cream and white ensemble			0
@entity47 clearly continues to be strongly influenced by @entity33			1
the outfit was almost identical to the red skirt suit @entity33 wore in october 1989 to visit @entity50 - from the vivid shade right down to the the buttons , pointy collar and sharp shoulders			2
at the height of her fame , the reticent , late @entity56 - based couturier @entity3 was synonymous with @entity33 ’s glamorous dresses			1
she made over 1,000 outfits for her @entity61 client ; the first three months after her wedding to @entity63 and the last a little black dress ordered a few weeks before she died ; @entity33 was buried in it			2
some of them – such as the white ‘ @entity69 ’ dress , pearl - studded with a bolero jacket – were among @entity33 ’s most memorable and showstopping looks			2
@entity7 has become the darling of the world 's media in much the same way as princess @entity33 did , and echoes her chic style 30 years later in a very similar outfit			1
she was wearing @entity3 , favoured by @entity33 @entity56 - based couturier @entity3 was synonymous with @entity33 ’s glamorous dresses , including these piece			1
she made over 1,000 outfits for her @entity61 client , even the little black dress she was buried in she wore a @entity32 smock to leave hospital with baby @entity25 , and @entity32 gowns – one white silk , another with a black halter neck - when she was photographed by @entity86 for @entity87 in 1997			0
@entity32 ’s particular talent - and one which will appeal to @entity7 as much as it did @entity33 - was for making outfits that showed off the woman rather than the frock			1
they were dignifed yet - particularly post @entity63 and @entity33 ’s divorce - more than a little daring			2
her clothes are statements of style rather than fashion , and the fabric and cut are always perfect			0
so it should n’t have been that much of a surprise when @entity106 chose the fashion house , run since @entity3 ’s death in 2010 by her second husband and business partner , @entity111 , to make her triumphant pale blue coat and dress for the @entity114			2
the young prince wore a cream cardigan over a white shirt , matching shorts and leather shoes smart : meanwhile , a hands - free @entity25 disembarked the plane looking dapper in a navy blue suit the @entity124 clearly won @entity106 loyalty on that day			0
@entity106 wore @entity3 again to @entity26 ’s christening			0
it was n’t long before @entity7 turned to @entity32 too , choosing the label to make two stunning outfits for her first official trip to @entity28			0
one , a grey wool pencil dress , was particularly striking , showing off @entity7 ’s slender post-wedding figure to perfection			0
however , this week ’s outfit wo n’t win as many fashion plaudits			0
it looked more @entity138 air hostess than royal style icon - add a slash of red lipstick and a jauntily - tied scarf and she ’d be offering you a glass of champagne before take - off			0
@entity33 is n’t the only royal from whom @entity7 is taking style inspiration			1
she is also wearing the @entity14 ’s diamond fern brooch , a gift from the @entity152 in 1954 and what appear to be @entity155 tan tights			0
hands full : @entity7 was carrying baby @entity26 and holding onto the railing of the plane 's stairs at the same time however , where were the hemline weights which preserve @entity164 modesty on even the most blustery days ? instead , @entity7 ’s fabulous thighs had another airing as she walked down the aeroplane steps , which sadly detracted from what could have otherwise been a polished look			2
the @entity171 pillbox hat , too – a little bit @entity173 , but a lot more @entity175 – marks her out as one of the family , part of the @entity61 lineage , mother and wife to heirs to the throne			0
her £ 400 shoes from @entity186 boutique @entity185 ( with a matching £ 200 clutch ) make a welcome change from those nude @entity190 heels she ’s so attached to , and lengthen her already fabulous legs			0
her red coat and dress also showcased her neat waist and slender limbs beautifully			0
@entity7 clearly knows - just as her late mother - in - law did - that a @entity3 ensemble shows a woman ’s figure off to its best advantage .			1

@entity7 stepped off plane in longer coat - but it was caught by a gust of wind
she has had a number of ' @entity20 ' moments in shorter dresses
outfit designed by @entity3 , designer favoured by @entity33
