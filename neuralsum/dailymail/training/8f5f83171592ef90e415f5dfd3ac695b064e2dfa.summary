there are few people around that would think of putting a snake in their mouth , particularly one that is wrapped around a tarantula			1
but this is exactly what @entity8 , a man nicknamed the ' @entity9 ' has done while a friend captures his actions on video			2
quite why he is so keen to put a snake and spider in his mouth is not clear - and it 's not for the faint - hearted - but what a man 's got ta do ... the bizarre video emerged from @entity22 and the footage was captured in the city of @entity25 earlier this year			1
@entity26 , nicknamed the ‘ @entity9 ’ , is seen handling a banded cat - eyed snake and a pinktoe tarantula before wrapping the snake around the spider and placing them both in his mouth			1
and look away ... now ! the furry legs of the tarantual wave around inside the man 's mouth he then holds the creatures in his mouth for a few seconds until they gradually fall out			2
@entity8 says he has been charming and training poisonous animals for more than 15 years			0
according to @entity42 a sting from the pinktoe tarantula is not lethal but could cause dermatitis or necrosis			1
do n't pick me ! @entity8 begins the process of handling the snake while the tarantula watches your turn now : the man dubbed the @entity9 of snakes handles the tarantual gently and in we go ...			2
@entity8 pops the wrap into his mouth			0
why ? well only he knows the answer to that gross out : the spider and snake writhe about in his mouth before gradually falling out no wonder he wraps it up so carefully inside the snake			1
pinktoes do n't get as large as your common or garden tarantual , with a leg span of around five inches			0
tarantulas are often feature in horro movies , which has given these big , furry spiders an undeserved bad rap			0
they strike fear in the hearts of arachnophobes everywhere , but in truth , tarantulas are some of the least aggressive and dangerous spiders around			0
still , do n't try this at home kids .			0
