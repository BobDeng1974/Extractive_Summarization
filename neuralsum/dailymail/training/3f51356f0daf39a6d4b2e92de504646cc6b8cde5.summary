fishermen can be very protective over their favourite spot as these brown bears showed when they got into a fight over salmon			1
these images were taken by 15 - year - old schoolgirl @entity6 as she watched the animals attempting to catch their dinner in @entity9 , in southern @entity10			1
@entity6 said one bear was catching a steady stream of fish when the other grew jealous after hardly catching any and tried to muscle his way in			1
while the newcomer was tolerated for a while , eventually he began to treat on the claws of the other bear , which is when the fighting started			2
@entity6 , who was watching from a grassy verge said : ' i had been watching the bear fish from a safe distance when i noticed another bear wander in			2
' the first bear was not happy about the other bear being there and began to get more agitated as it began to try to catch fish in the water			0
' it was n't long before the two approached one another and began roaring ferociously to try and scare each other away			0
neither one would back down for quite a while and they began to grapple with each other in the water			0
' eventually , the new bear on the scene decided to cut its loses and sulked off out of sight			0
when they are fishing they look quite cute and innocent but when they fight you get to see the true nature of the animals			0
