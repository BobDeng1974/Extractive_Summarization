dual @entity1 champion jockey @entity0 , whose 31 wins at the @entity3 in march include all big three prizes – the @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , gives his assessment of the early clues for this season ’s meeting			1
@entity14 winner @entity12 looks worthy of taking his place in the @entity7 in march but the one i took from the race was @entity19 even though he finished eighth			1
he is gorgeous , progressive horse and i am a big fan			1
the ground was a bit too soft for my mount , @entity24 , who was pulled up			2
on that going , over three miles and a quarter miles in a competitive handicap at @entity29 , ideally you need to have had a run under your belt or be very , very fit			2
@entity19 ridden by @entity32 ( right ) , has recently caught the eye of jockey @entity0 @entity34 riding many clouds ( @entity36 ) win the @entity14 at @entity29 on november 29 @entity19 , on his seasonal debut , travelled well until fading in the last two furlongs			1
he looked like a horse who would improve an awful lot for the run			2
he might have been very unlucky at last season ’s @entity3 when he fell and the fact that trainer @entity44 pitched him into a race like the @entity46 tells you a lot			2
@entity49 ’ @entity46 runner - up @entity50 also ran a great race but appreciated the soft ground and you would have to question whether he would be as effective on better ground when assessing future prospects			1
jockey @entity0 will ride @entity57 in the @entity58 at @entity59 on december 28 i am looking forward to riding @entity57 in the @entity58 at @entity59 on december 28			2
he won it last year like a class horse			2
for me , it was as good a run as his 2013 @entity7 win			1
i ’d like to think my possible mount @entity66 would be good enough to make the frame in the big @entity69 chase in @entity70 , the @entity71 at @entity72 on @entity73			0
but , even if he is ready to run , i ’m not sure it is the right option for him for a first race of the season			0
@entity80 - trained @entity79 looks a worthy favourite to win for a second year			1
he won @entity83 ’s @entity82 like a horse who had a bit in hand			0
@entity0 riding @entity88 in action at @entity91 racecourse last month @entity92 is favourite for the @entity5 but should he really be at the head of the pecking order ? probably not			1
he has been very impressive but has n’t beaten a true @entity5 contender yet			1
putting that into context , last year ’s third @entity96 has done all he has been asked in his two runs this season			0
@entity101 , who i won the race on last season , was beaten by @entity105 in his comeback but generally improves for running			0
there wo n’t be any panic in his camp yet			0
@entity92 , ridden by @entity110 , goes on to win the @entity111 at @entity112 on november 22 never judge a horse on one day			1
so i would not draw too drastic a conclusion on my @entity116 winner more of that losing his unbeaten record in @entity29 ’s @entity120			0
the hurdles ’ track was a good bit softer than the chase track and his opposition included race - fit rivals			1
if you take a horse out of his comfort zone , it is very easy to get him beaten and he looked out of his comfort zone a lot of the way			0
if he has is a little breathing issue , i ’m sure they will correct it but i would doubt he has lost the class he showed last season			0
@entity44 - trained @entity145 won sunday 's @entity146 's @entity58 it is hard to find fault with @entity44 - trained @entity150 ’s win in sunday ’s @entity151			1
that was the most impressive performance from a novice chaser i ’ve seen this season			0
i won on @entity156 ’s @entity155 at last month ’s @entity158 meeting and , at this stage , he is the novice hurdler which has made most impression on me			0
