by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 05:44 est , 27 august 2013 hospitals have been accused of conning the public with bogus claims about the quality and choice of food on offer to patients			2
@entity10 hospitals claim their own studies show that 99 per cent of patient meals are rated ‘ good ’ or ‘ excellent ’			1
however , new figures from the care watchdog published today show that around half of patients feel hospital food is not good enough			1
only 55 per cent felt the meals were ‘ good ’			1
hospitals have been accused of conning the public with bogus claims about the quality and choice of food on offer to patients and some hospitals are spending as little as £ 2.94 a day to provide three meals to patients – a figure which seems to be indicative of poor quality			2
campaigners claim nutrition and quality standards are below those for prisons and @entity36 department restaurants which must adhere to mandatory levels			2
in some @entity10 trusts , such as the @entity39 and @entity40 , which serves @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , less than four in ten rated the food as ‘ good ’ , placing it bottom of the league of patient satisfaction			1
however , a survey of staff at its hospitals rated the food , which is prepared by outside contractors , as excellent			1
other low scores were given to the @entity55 in @entity56 , and the @entity57 , which includes @entity59 ’s hospital in @entity60			0
the research also reveals that there is little correlation between the amount of money spent on meals and their quality			0
for example , @entity68 and @entity40 trust spends a relatively high figure of £ 13 a day per patient , yet it came bottom on patient satisfaction			0
the lowest spending to provide three meals to patients was at the @entity77 , where the figure was just £ 2.94			0
only 52 per cent of patients said the food was good , however hospital staff said the quality and range was excellent			1
in some @entity10 trusts , such as the @entity39 and @entity40 , which serves @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , less than four in ten rated the food as ' good ' other low spending trusts were the @entity87 and @entity88 trust at just £ 3.65 a day , and @entity90 trust at £ 3.80 and the @entity92 trust in @entity93 at £ 3.82			1
the trust which spent the most on food was @entity96 in @entity93 at £ 15.65 a day , however the proportion of patients who rated the food as good was just 48 per cent			2
the figure at the @entity101 trust was £ 15.47 a day – five times higher than the nearby @entity103 hospitals			0
at @entity101 , the proportion of patients who rated food as good was 60 per cent			2
the damning figures were released by the campaign for @entity107 , which is supported by 97 organisations , including the @entity109 , @entity110 and the @entity111			0
all are calling on the government to support a change in the law that would improve all patient meals by requiring them to meet mandatory standards , including quality and nutrition			1
campaign co-ordinator , @entity120 , said : ‘ it is time for the government to come clean about the sorry state of hospital food in @entity90 and set mandatory standards for patient meals			1
‘ this would only involve extending an existing policy which has seen it set mandatory standards for prison food and food served in government departments , to go alongside those that already exist for school food			0
‘ surely patients recovering in hospital have the same right to good food as government ministers , school kids and prisoners ? ’ the @entity144 union , whose members work in hospital kitchens , claimed that meals produced in - house were generally a higher quality than those from outside contractors			1
its deputy head of health , @entity153 , said : ‘ while costs vary , it is plain that food cooked fresh on hospital premises scores the highest with patients			0
‘ @entity144 is backing calls for set standards for hospital food in @entity90			0
at the same time we want more hospitals to use kitchens to prepare and cook patient meals instead of bringing in ready - meals from outside			1
’ the @entity167 rejected the need for minimum legal standards and said the figures , which relate to 2011 - 12 , were out of date			0
a spokesman said : ‘ there are many fantastic examples of really good food across the @entity10 thanks to forward - thinking and innovative staff			1
‘ but , we recognise that there is too much variation across the country — that is why we have implemented a tough new inspection programme			0
‘ with our army of thousands of patient assessors we will drive up standards and reduce variation in hospital food			2
’ she added : ‘ we support the principle of food standards but do not think that legislation is the right way to proceed			2
‘ we believe that the best decisions on hospital food are those taken locally by chefs and catering managers			0
patients are the ones who consume hospital food and they are best - placed to decide what is good and what is not			0
