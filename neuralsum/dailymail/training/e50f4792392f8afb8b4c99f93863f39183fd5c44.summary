if you think golf balls do n't strike twice , you 'd be wrong ... as a @entity3 fan found out in rather painful fashion yesterday			0
the @entity6 tourist was enjoying the final round of the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when the golfing legend 's opening tee shot landed squarely on his head , spurting blood over his white polo shirt			1
an apologetic @entity16 came over to the man , who had travelled thousands of mile to see his hero play , and autographed a glove hoping it would seal the end of his bad luck			0
ouch ! the @entity6 tourist was enjoying the final round of the @entity8 at the @entity25 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when the golfing legend 's opening tee shot landed squarely on his head bloody : the man , who did not want to give his name , was forced to stem the bleeding with a hanky funny side : but he managed to see the funny side after @entity3 came over to apologise ' and i get this souvenir , ' he said , almost smiling as he held up the ball			1
' sorry about that , ' woods replied before handing him the signed glove			0
but minutes later the exact same thing happened again , forcing @entity16 to hand over a second signed glove with an accompanying apology			2
with glove : @entity3 then autographed a glove hoping it would seal the end of his bad luck not his day : minutes later the exact same thing happened again , forcing @entity16 to hand over a second signed glove and its accompanying apology back in the buggy : later , @entity3 and his girlfriend @entity53 were pictured as they returned to his famous luxury yacht , @entity56 , where they were staying lap of luxury : they stayed on the boat which was docked in @entity60 for about a week as he usually has for the past few years when he comes to play in the annual @entity63 tournament in @entity60 the next question , then , was n't could he catch eventual winner @entity66 , but did he have enough golf gloves in his bag ? he ended the day with a six - over par 78 , beating only two of the field 's 68 players .			2
