by @entity0 a breathtakingly expensive divorce battle between a major @entity3 stakeholder and his wife - a former miss @entity6 - has been branded ‘ out of control ’ in an extraordinary attack by a high court judge			1
foreign divorce cases like this one that are fought in @entity13 deny people in need ‘ precious court time ’ for more serious legal matters , said mr @entity18 during a taxpayer - funded hearing			1
he said parents who were seeking ‘ precious court time to recover their children from abduction ’ would be kept waiting as long as lengthy foreign divorce cases were allowed clog up the @entity27 courts			1
the @entity29 couple , mr @entity30 , 75 , who owns a 40per cent stake in @entity3 and his estranged wife @entity32 , 66 , have already wracked up costs of £ 1.6 million on what mr @entity18 called ‘ preliminary skirmishes ’ in the extraordinary battle			1
@entity32 : demanding £ 500million in her divorce from @entity3 stake holder @entity30 mr @entity40 , who owns a £ 30million property in @entity42 , has alone incurred costs of £ 920,000 in @entity13 fighting the case			1
but the senior judge pointed out that the couple , who do not pay tax in @entity27 , are actually paying a fraction of the costs of the taxpayer - funded court hearings , have only contributed £ 2,355 towards six days of court fees			2
mr @entity18 said : ‘ neither of them are @entity27 citizens			1
neither of them currently pays any @entity13 taxes whatsoever			0
‘ very serious issues ought to arise as to just how much time of an @entity13 court these parties should be able to take up on these preliminary skirmishes , whilst squeezing out the many needy litigants who need precious court time to recover their children from abduction or seek their return from care , and other such issues			0
’ @entity32 , pictured as a former miss @entity6 in 1969 , and @entity29 businessmen @entity30 ms @entity32 is seeking £ 500 million in the case , which would represent the largest divorce settlement in @entity27 to date			1

the couple led a luxury lifestyle - with homes in @entity84 and @entity6 , a £ 1million wine collection and £ 4.5million apartment in @entity87 - but mr @entity77 says he gave up his personal ambitions to allow his ' breadwinner ' wife @entity89 to pursue her career			2
ms @entity89 had fought having the divorce heard in @entity27 on the grounds that the @entity29 couple do not have any business interests in @entity27 - just property			2
it is thought she wanted to have the case heard in @entity6 as @entity27 judges are widely considered to be ' generous ' towards the partners of rich spouses			0
but judges this week ruled mr @entity77 could have his case heard in the @entity27 because he had been ' habitually resident ' for a year before the split			2
in 2011 , the late @entity105 oligarch @entity104 divorced his second wife in the costliest marriage split in @entity27 legal history			0
the massive payment dwarfed the previous @entity27 divorce record of £ 48million and came just two years before mr @entity104 's death			1
it has not yet been decided whether the full divorce hearing will be heard in @entity13 or @entity6			0
but the top judge said it ‘ borders on the fantastic ’ that ’ 10 days of precious court time ’ have been reserved in october for the @entity118 to consider where the case will be heard			0
a one - day hearing last week for an application for maintenance cost ms chai £ 55,000			0

ms @entity32 , who was miss @entity6 in 1969 , is represented by the ‘ @entity146 ’ @entity147 , who said these legal fees are ‘ small beer for the ultra rich ’			1
‘ when you have a couple trying to divide up billions of hundreds of millions , the legal costs are generally high , because there ’s enough at stake to make it worth it			0
it ’s the biggest financial transaction most people will ever undergo			0
‘ @entity161 cases are what make @entity13 justice affordable for the needy , ’ she told the @entity159			0
