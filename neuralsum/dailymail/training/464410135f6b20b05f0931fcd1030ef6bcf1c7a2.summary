@entity1 's director general @entity0 , pictured , wants to target @entity3 users enforcement officers working on behalf of the @entity1 are being offered bonuses of up to £ 1,000 a month to pursue people who fail to pay the tv licence fee			1
almost 200,000 people are taken to court each year accused of failing to pay the £ 145.50 fee			2
they risk a £ 1,000 fine , a criminal record and even jail			0
now private firm @entity13 , which runs the @entity1 's licensing service , has launched a major recruitment drive to hire extra ' enforcement officers ' to hunt down even more fee dodgers			1
potential employees were told they could double their basic salaries with commission for collecting the evidence the @entity1 needs to prosecute householders			1
a @entity13 regional manager said : ' a decent officer , hitting targets nine times out of ten , in @entity27 , is [ on ] £ 30k plus , quite easily			1
' enforcement officers are offered a basic salary of £ 14,000 , which rises to £ 17,000 in @entity27 , but they can as much as double this with commission – the equivalent of an extra £ 1,000 a month			1
@entity13 's two - day recruitment drive began last week , on the same day culture secretary @entity34 called for a review into decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee			1
the @entity1 is responsible for more than one in ten criminal prosecutions , leading to complaints these are clogging up the criminal courts			1
last night @entity43 mp @entity42 called on the @entity1 to review how it collects the fee			1
he said : ' i 'm sure the public will come forward with some evidence of the heavy - handed way licence fee collection is enforced			2
' i know from the stories sent to me that there 'll be some pretty harrowing accounts			0
' i personally know people who have felt so intimidated by enforcement officers that they have paid for a tv licence even when they have n't owned a television			2
' they could n't stand the stress of the aggressive methods and officers knocking on the door			2
' at a recruitment day , aspiring officers were told the purpose of the role is to ' maximise sales for the @entity1 ' and ' enforce prosecution proceedings by taking statements under caution '			1
once an officer has taken 30 statements from householders in a week they can start earning commission			2
these are higher if customers pay in full on the doorstep			0
there is a smaller bonus if customers choose to pay in instalments – in case they cancel payments – or if those not at home end up taking out a licence after a calling card is left at their address			0
this is considered an ' indirect sale '			0
last night critics said these bonuses could encourage officers to harass householders for upfront payments			2
private firm @entity13 , which runs the @entity1 's licensing service , has launched a major recruitment drive to hire extra ' enforcement officers ' to hunt down even more fee dodgers ( file pic ) @entity100 of the @entity101 said : ' it does n't seem right that these officers are incentivised to push for full payments over instalments , when the whole reason some people may not be paying on time is that they 're short of cash			1
' in 2012 , 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying for a tv licence , accounting for one in nine of all cases in the magistrates ' courts			0
most of those found guilty were fined up to £ 1,000 and given a criminal record , and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines			0
mr @entity34 last week said a review of licence fee enforcement ' needs to begin now '			1
he said : ' in 2012/13 , almost 200,000 people ended up in court accused of not buying a tv licence			0
' more than 50 were sent to prison			0
when over 10 per cent of magistrates ' court cases concern this one offence , you have to ask whether the current system is really working			0
' the government is committed to a review of decriminalisation once the @entity133 receives @entity134			2
but we ca n't afford to wait that long			0
this needs to begin now			0
' last month the @entity1 's director general @entity0 said viewers who avoid paying the licence by only watching catch - up shows on @entity3 could still have to pay			1
he said : ' it could be modernised again so it applies to watching @entity1 programmes both live and on @entity3			1
this is for the government to decide , but worth considering			0
' in june , the @entity145 revealed that 463,846 people avoided buying a tv licence through the @entity3 loophole , declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year			0
a tv licensing spokesman said : ' in 2013/14 licence fee evasion cost the @entity1 between £ 196million and £ 235million in lost revenue , so it 's important that we minimise evasion to ensure as much money as possible goes towards @entity1 programmes			1
' we do everything we can to make sure people are aware of their legal obligations and are given every opportunity to pay for a tv licence			0
