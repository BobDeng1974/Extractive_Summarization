this huge carp has literally taken the bait again after it was caught by the same angler , 14 years after their first encounter			2
angler @entity4 was surprised to see an ‘ old friend ’ on the end of his fishing reel when he caught the same common carp at @entity11 fishery in @entity12 , @entity13 that he had reeled in back in 1999			1
photographed with the impressive 26lbs carp back then , mr @entity4 posed for the same picture with the same fish , now doubled in size - a huge 54lbs 12ozs			1
an ' old friend ' takes the bait again : angler @entity4 poses with the same common carp he caught back in 1999 which has since doubled in size while the keen angler has fished elsewhere since his 1999 catch , he returned to the lake and cast his rod from the same spot , hoping for similar success			1
after three hours , he got just that when he felt a nibble			0
he spent the next 40 minutes reeling in the carp only to discover that the fish had the same distinctive bald patch halfway down one side as his previous catch , 14 years before			1
mr @entity4 , a builder , said : ‘ i used to fish at the lake years ago but moved on to somewhere else after i had caught most of the carp in there			1
‘ i decided to pop back recently and returned to the same swim where i first caught the carp at 26lbs 14 years ago			0
the first catch : when he caught the fish back in 1999 it weighed 26lbs			2
he noticed it had a distinctive bald patch halfway down one side , the very same unique mark he recognised on the carp he caught recently ‘ i was there for three hours when i had some luck but it was n't until i got the fish into the net that i saw its bald patch on one side			1
‘ it was a big fish back then and it 's obviously even bigger now			0
‘ i was really chuffed because at 54lbs it was a personal best catch for me			0
it was nice seeing the same fish again , like meeting up with an old friend			0
’ mr @entity4 returned the carp , which is estimated to be about 20 - years - old , back into the water after their reunion			2
it was caught at the 1.5 acre fishery which is home to more than 150 fish .			0
