by @entity0 the man who inspired @entity4 ' @entity3 character the dude is suing the hospital where his mother died for $ 10million			1
@entity9 film producer @entity8 , 65 , claims poor communication between doctors caused his mother 's rapid decline and death at @entity15			1
she was admitted to the hospital with bronchitis last march and was dead within a month after suffering internal bleeding , dehydration and , finally , a massive stroke , the lawsuit says			2
the original dude : @entity8 speaks at the 2014 @entity24 in @entity25 last week			2
the @entity9 producer is suing @entity15 , claiming poor communication led to his mother 's death there @entity8 told @entity31 his mother was handed from one doctor to another without proper briefings on the medication she was taking , a breakdown in communication that he believes led to her death			1
@entity8 's anger at his mother 's death , and his determination to do something about it , seems to be a long way from his laid - back depiction in the @entity46 and @entity47 's film @entity3			1
released in 1998 but set in the early ' 90s , the film tells the story of @entity50 , an unemployed @entity25 slacker who , after a case of mistaken identity , finds himself embroiled in a kidnap for ransom plot			0
although the plot is fictional , and loosely based on the work of crime novellist @entity59 , the character of the dude is based on @entity8 , who had long worked with the @entity47			1
@entity8 has said that @entity4 ' portrayal of the dude - his own nickname from sixth - grade - is accurate , right down to the body language			2
' lem me say something about @entity4			0
i 'm born on november 20 , 1949 , @entity4 is born on december 3 , 1949 , ' he told @entity67 last year			0
' this means , every time he heard a song for the first time growing up , whether it was in sixth grade , or eighth grade , or tenth grade , that was the same day i heard it for the first time			0
' so we 're very closely hooked ... and he 's a stoner too , so it was n't a stretch for @entity4 to play me			2
in terms of philosophically , spiritually , all that kind of stuff , that 's who he kind of naturally is			2
' @entity4 was actually born on december 4			0
@entity8 fell in with the @entity47 when they were promoting their first film @entity88 in 1984			1
his idiosyncratic character inspired the character of @entity3 in @entity3 , played by @entity4 , right not a slacker : @entity8 is regarded in @entity9 as a film marketing and distribution guru , as well as working as a producer , a writer , and helping @entity96 start the @entity97 but although @entity3 's dude is an inveterate slacker , the real dude could not be further from lazy			1
he is also no stranger to activism			0
in the 1970s he first shot into the public eye as a member of the @entity104			0
that was a group of young radicals who were indicted on charges of inciting riot in connection with a violent @entity111 protest			0
although he was briefly jailed for contempt of court , he and his co-defendants were cleared of the riot charges after government witnesses admitted they would ' go to any length ' to fight the radicals			0
some years later @entity8 moved to @entity25 , where he fell in with the then relatively unknown @entity47 while they were promoting their first film @entity88 in 1984			1
since then , he has earned an enviable reputation as a film marketing and distribution guru , as well as working as a producer and producer 's representative , a writer , and helping @entity96 start the @entity97			0
now , spurred on by his mother 's treatment , @entity8 is turning some of that energy towards righting the wrongs he perceives in @entity130 's healthcare industry			1
he says he wants to reform the way that medical staff communicate and , in so doing , save hundreds of thousands of people he says die every year from similar kinds of failures			0
@entity8 is also suing a convalescent home over his mother 's death			1
@entity15 has made no comment on the lawsuit .			2

@entity8 's mother died of a stroke last april at @entity15
he claims that poor communication between doctors caused her decline
@entity8 was the @entity47 ' inspiration for @entity3 in @entity3
he is a *big* behind the scenes figure in @entity9 's indie movie scene
