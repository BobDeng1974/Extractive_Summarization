@entity6 , 46 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was heartbroken after finding out she could n't have children of her own - but found comfort in a £ 1,000 doll of a curly - haired toddler as well as two other ' babies ' and a chimpanzee			1
appearing with her doll @entity15 , who she helped create , on @entity17 ’s this morning , @entity6 revealed how her dolls have helped filled a void in her life			1
‘ i ’ve always desperately wanted children			1
i had baby dolls as a baby girl , i had tea sets , i played house , ' she said			1
‘ i always thought it would be marriage and family			2
that ’s all i ever wanted out of life			2
’ however , after marrying at the age of 22 , @entity6 endured six gruelling years of fertility treatment			1
‘ after so long , you then have to decide to stop			2
you have to decide are you going to go on and on and on			0
but you have to decide for the sake of your own sanity			0
’ @entity6 says that adopting was n’t an option due to her disability , but her life changed on a trip to @entity57 in 2005			1
‘ i was in a big toy store looking at the dolls			1
one of the sales assistants asked if i wanted to hold a baby doll			1
‘ i picked it up and i was smitten			0
it weight about four pounds , it was about 19 inches long			0
‘ it felt so lifelike , like a real baby			0
i thought , " i ’ve never felt like this before , i ’ve got to have it			0
" ’ @entity6 says that her dolls have had a profound and positive effect on her health			1
@entity6 , who has several medical conditions , says that as well as helping her deal with not being able to have children , her dolls help with her pain ‘ i found then and i find now that on bad days , when pain meds wo n’t touch my health issues i could hold one of the babies and they would help take the edge off			1
‘ it is a really amazing , amazing feeling			0
’ though she says initially she never thought she would take her doll out in public , when she acquired a second doll her attitude changed			1
‘ in 2009 i got a little boy and i thought well , i see all these nice things on websites			0
‘ i got a bottle and thought let ’s just see what it feels like , and it ’s an amazing thing			0
‘ i just did a little bit at first , i fed him and it was a lovely feeling			0
‘ the way i describe it is it filled a hole inside me that i had n’t released was empty			2
it just gave me a feeling of completion			0
' as well as @entity101 has two other lifelike dolls , @entity103 ( right ) and @entity104 ( left ) who are babies @entity15 , who appears with @entity6 on this morning was created based on a character from a script by her writer husband			1
@entity6 helped design him and gave him the pixie ears as his character in the stories is a lepricorn			1
she also has two other lifelike dolls , known as reborns			2
they are named @entity103 and @entity104 , and both are babies			2
she buys them presents , sings them lullabies to get them to sleep and takes them out to the park			0
the silicone dummies are hand - picked for their realistic weight and soft feel but they lack the sounds - and smells - of a real baby			2
nonetheless every morning she wakes up early to warm bottles of formula and feed her family			0
her home is filled with all the equipment new mothers need , including baby bouncers , bottles and comforter blankets			2
‘ if @entity28 is around the house and not away on a business trip then obviously he ’s the real person in the house and he gets the attention , ’ @entity6 explains			1
‘ but if i ’m on my own it ’s cool to be able to do things with the babies ; to feed them and change them and cuddle them			2
despite receiving negative comments about her dolls , @entity6 says she has gone public with her passion because many others are too scared to admit they love reborns			1
‘ i ’ve met so many people who have said i ’d love to do what you do , i ’d love to have reborns and take them out but i ’m too scared			0
‘ i ’m not hurting anyone and its help me come to terms with not being a mother			0
but it ’s done so much more than that			0
it ’s brought me so much joy and so much help			0
it ’s been such a force for good			0
’ the latest member of @entity6 ’s family is a reborn chimpanzee named @entity174 and she says she will definitely be continuing to add to her clan			1
‘ in january , another little girl is coming who ’s going to be about the size of a nine month old , 26 inches long , so a little smaller than @entity15			1
