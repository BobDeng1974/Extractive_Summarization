the prime minister said that he ' loves public service ' and would continue to serve his constituents even if he is ' hoofed out ' of @entity8 in may			2
in contrast to @entity10 , who left @entity1 when he stopped being prime minister in 2007 and has made a personal fortune , mr @entity0 said he planned to ' stick with ' voters in his @entity15 constituency			1
it 's a vocation for me			2
' in the unhappy event i 'm not prime minister on may 8 , the people of @entity31 i hope will stick with me and i 'll stick with them			2
' asked what he would do if he was no longer prime minister in an interview with the website @entity36 , mr @entity0 said : ' i 'm not going to think about that because i 've got 50 days to fight the vital election and want to win re-election			1
' i think this government is doing some good things for our country and i want to keep on doing that			2
' it 's the country 's choice , if they hoof me out and go for the other guy , i 'll have to think of something else			2
but i hope i hope i 'll still be a member of parliament			0
' he insisted that the @entity18 could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament			1

he said : ' now when you set up your account the filters are automatically on			0
i ' ve got three children of primary school age and they get to find out the code on your @entity67 pretty quickly			0
' it is reassuring to know the government has done some very good things on this			0
i think having the filters switched on is good			0
' mr @entity0 said that his children do not have unfettered access to mobile phones			1
he said : ' my daughter has got an @entity77 but everything is quite strictly controlled in terms of screen time and we have the filters on for things like my @entity67			0
' but this is a conversation every parent in the country is having with their children			0
what age should they be when they should have a @entity93 account and unfettered access to a mobile phone ? ' we 've got an 11 - year - old , a nine - year - old and a four - year - old so we 're not at that stage yet			0
' mr @entity0 dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open - necked shirt for the interview with @entity36 in central @entity106 mr @entity0 said that he personally has an @entity107 ' which is basically for family and friends ' and a @entity110 that he uses for work emails			1

' when asked if he ever sneaks out of @entity3 without his security detail , mr @entity0 said : ' no because they are trained killers			1
' questioned on the four schoolgirls from east @entity106 who are thought to have fled to @entity125 to join the so - called @entity126 , mr @entity0 said : ' i think they 're deeply misguided and potentially joining a criminal organisation that could make them part of a terrorist conspiracy			1

mr @entity137 last week faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that he had two kitchens after he and his wife @entity151 were filmed in the smaller of the pair for a @entity154 interview			2
mr @entity0 said : ' we actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen , not least because i had a very disabled son , @entity146 , and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him			1
' the point is not whether you have got two kitchens , but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it 's your kitchen			0
' the interview was part of the @entity173 website 's @entity171 series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer			0

@entity36 , which is well - known for its list - based articles , has become increasingly popular with young people on both sides of the @entity191 , but mr @entity0 faced embarrassment at a no 10 @entity194 drinks party in december last year when he asked a group of the site 's writers : ' what is ' the @entity36 ' ?
