by @entity0 and @entity1 a hotly disputed @entity3 torture report concludes that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods provided no key evidence in the hunt for @entity8 , according to congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation a controversial @entity3 report has concluded that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods provided no key evidence in the hunt for @entity8 , according to congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation			1
former @entity16 administration and some senior @entity18 officials have claimed the evidence trail leading to their @entity22 mastermind 's compound in @entity23 vindicated the ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' authorized after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
but @entity26 and some @entity28 senators have disputed that account , describing simulated drownings , sleep deprivation and other such practices as cruel and ineffective			0
congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation told @entity0 the @entity35 's report on interrogations , renditions and detentions examined the treatment of several high - level terror detainees and the information they provided on @entity8			1
the aides and people briefed on the report spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential document			0
the most high - profile detainee linked to the @entity8 investigation was @entity50 , whom the @entity18 waterboarded 183 times			1
@entity50 , intelligence officials have noted , confirmed after his 2003 capture that he knew an important @entity22 courier with the nom de guerre @entity54			2
but the report concludes that such information was not critical , according to the aides			0
@entity50 only discussed @entity60 months after being waterboarded , while he was under standard interrogation , they said			2
and @entity50 neither acknowledged @entity54 's significance nor provided interrogators with the courier 's real name			2
the most high - profile detainee linked to the @entity8 investigation was @entity50 ( left ) , whom the @entity18 waterboarded 183 times			1
former @entity16 administration and some senior @entity18 officials have claimed the evidence trail leading to @entity8 's @entity23 compound vindicated ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' the debate over how investigators put the pieces together is significant because years later , the courier led @entity76 intelligence to the sleepy @entity23 military town of @entity78			1
there , @entity79 killed @entity8 in a secret mission			0
the @entity18 also has pointed to the value of information provided by senior @entity22 operative @entity84 , who was captured in 2005 and held at a secret prison			1
@entity76 officials have described how @entity84 made up a name for a trusted courier and denied knowing @entity54			0
@entity89 , they said , was so adamant and unbelievable in his denial that the @entity18 took it as confirmation he and @entity50 were protecting the courier			1
but the report concludes evidence gathered from @entity84 was n't significant either , the aides said			0
essentially , they argued , @entity50 , @entity84 and others subjected to harsh treatment confirmed only what investigators already knew about the courier			2
and when they denied the courier 's significance or provided misleading information , investigators would only have considered that significant if they already presumed the courier 's importance			0
the aides did not address information provided by yet another @entity22 operative : @entity110 , captured in @entity111 in 2004			1
intelligence officials have described @entity110 as the true linchpin of the @entity8 investigation after he identified @entity54 as a critical courier			1
in a 2012 news release , sen. @entity116 , @entity117 , the head of the @entity35 , and sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , acknowledged an unidentified ' third detainee ' had provided relevant information on the courier			2
but they said he did so the day before he was subjected to harsh @entity18 interrogation			2
' this information will be detailed in the @entity35 's report , ' the senators said at the time			2
in any case , it still took the @entity18 years to learn @entity60 's real identity : sheikh @entity54 , a @entity23 man born in @entity133			0
how the @entity76 learned of @entity54 's name is still unclear			0
the @entity22 leader @entity8 was killed at this compound in @entity78 by @entity136 without providing full details , aides said the @entity3 report illustrates the importance of the @entity142 's efforts overseas			2
intelligence officials have previously described how in the years when the @entity18 could not find where @entity8 's courier was , @entity142 eavesdroppers came up with nothing until 2010 - when @entity54 had a telephone conversation with someone monitored by @entity76 intelligence			1
at that point , @entity76 intelligence was able to follow @entity54 to @entity8 's hideout			0
@entity116 and other senators have spoken only vaguely of the contents of the classified review			0
but they have made references to the divergence between their understanding of how the @entity8 operation came together and assertions of former @entity18 and @entity16 administration officials who have defended harsh interrogations			1
responding to former @entity18 deputy director @entity165 's argument that @entity50 and @entity84 provided the ' lead information ' on the @entity8 operation , @entity116 and @entity119 said , ' the original lead information had no connection to @entity18 detainees			1
' @entity170 : the hunt for @entity8 was portrayed in the @entity173 - directed film in 2012 starring @entity174 ( pictured )			2
the film did not shy away from water - boarding they rejected former cia director @entity179 's claim that evidence on the couriers began with interrogations at black sites and attorney general @entity185 's declaration that intelligence leading to @entity8 began with @entity50			1
the facts , they said , show that the @entity18 learned of the courier , his true name and location ' through means unrelated to the @entity18 detention and interrogation program			0
' they have cited a ' wide variety of intelligence sources and methods			0
' terror suspects who were waterboarded ' provided no new information about the courier ' and offered no indication of where @entity8 was hiding , the senators said			1
@entity116 will push to release a summary of the intelligence committee 's review later this week , starting a declassification process that could take several months before any documents are made public			0
@entity3 investigators and @entity18 officials already are locked in a simmering dispute over competing claims of wrongdoing in the congressional investigation			1
@entity116 accuses the agency of improperly monitoring the computer use of @entity3 staffers and deleting files , undermining the @entity220 's separation of powers			0
the @entity18 says the intelligence panel illegally accessed certain documents			0
the @entity224 is reviewing criminal complaints against both sides			0
aides said @entity119 and sen. @entity228 , @entity229 , who himself was tortured as a prisoner war in @entity231 more than four decades ago , are among those pushing hard to ensure the investigation 's findings related to the @entity8 pursuit and @entity18 interrogations are made public			1
they and @entity116 were among @entity239 ' critics of how the hunt was portrayed in the film ' @entity170 , ' which they said was fictional .			0

senators dispute account of former @entity16 administration and some senior @entity18 officials that ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' were vindicated
