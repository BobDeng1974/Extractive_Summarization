@entity7 leapt onto the bonnet of the raider 's getaway car and was dragged 20 yards down the road as he attempted to stop the pair making their escape after they threatened to shoot next door shopkeeper @entity16			1
the thugs - who only had their eyes visible - pistol - whipped mr @entity16 and ordered the father - of - four to fill a supermarket bag with Â£ 30,000 of jewels as they pointed their weapon at his wife @entity23 , 35 , and three - year - old daughter			1
the raiders leapt into a waiting black @entity44 but were confronted by mr @entity7 , 34 , who stood in the car 's path			1
@entity47 captured the moment they accelerated forward and threw the father - of - one onto the bonnet			1
he was carried along for 20 yards before being flung to the ground			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i heard all the commotion and then saw two figures in burkas running off with @entity16 chasing them and shouting ' stop , robbers ! " lucky : estate agent @entity7 tried to stop the robbers by standing in front of their getaway car			1
mr @entity16 stands outside his shop ' one of the men had the top of his burka missing and was wearing a balaclava over his face			1
' so i stood in front of their car and raised my hands shouting ' stop '			2
instead they drove straight at me and i had to leap on to the bonnet			2
' the duo are still at large			0
reliving his ordeal , mr @entity16 said : ' you have to live life like a lion , not a jackal			0
' i did n't have time to be scared , but i would do the same if it happened again			0
' pistol : moments before mr @entity7 's ordeal , @entity16 had seen of the two robbers , who were armed with a gun terrifying : the robbers point a gun in the father 's face demanding he empty the shop of jewels @entity97 versus jackals : rather than handover the jewellery to the robbers , mr @entity99 confronts them @entity103 : mr @entity16 forces both robbers out of the shop despite one of them ordering the other to shoot him he learned how to handle a gun while doing army training in his native @entity109 and added : ' i was n't just going to give everything away like that			1
i was angry so i tried to grab his gun			0
' he hit me across the shoulders with the gun and then tried to break the glass on the jewellery display case			0
' i began wrestling and pushing him			0
then as the men turned to flee i pulled off the top of his burka			2
' he had a balaclava underneath			0
i do n't think either man was @entity124 - the first had a @entity126 accent and i think the second was white			2
' formidable : @entity16 lived to tell the tale of his terrifying ordeal at the hands of the armed robbers action : the father - of - one heard his neighbour 's cries for help and jumped to his aid , but was forced onto the bonnet of their car his brother @entity141 , 29 , who owns the @entity143 jewellery store in @entity144 , @entity145 , said : ' @entity16 thought maybe it was a fake gun , but he did n't know for sure			1
' so he managed to get the raider away from his daughter @entity149 and then began arguing with him and shouting			2
' the other robber shouted to his colleague to shoot both @entity16 and @entity149 , but instead he panicked and they both fled			2
' @entity153 are appealing for witnesses to the raid at 2.10pm on july 31			0
a spokesman said : ' one of the offenders was seen carrying a firearm , but it is yet to be ascertained whether the firearm was genuine or an imitation			0

trying to stop them , @entity7 was forced to leap on the bonnet
