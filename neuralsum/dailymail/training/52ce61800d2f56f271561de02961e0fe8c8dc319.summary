the key to keeping weight off could be as easy as hopping on the scales , according to a study			2
research shows that people who have slimmed down regain less weight if they simply weigh themselves once a week			2
in fact , the pounds seem to keep dropping off			0
the finding is important because , as every slimmer knows , it is when the diet ends that the hard work really begins			0
and despite the best of intentions , many dieters struggle to maintain their new slimline figures			0
those who took up the offer gained half a stone less than the others @entity29 researcher @entity28 said that stepping on the bathroom scales could be a ‘ simple , pragmatic strategy that people could use to stop weight - regain and keep them on track ’			1
more than 3,000 successful slimmers were offered vouchers for bathroom scales and asked to weigh themselves weekly for nine months			1
just under a third took up the offer and their progress was compared with another group who had also lost weight but were n’t given any help in keeping it off			2
those in the ‘ weigh - in ’ group regained almost half a stone less than the others , the @entity45 @entity44 on @entity46 in @entity47 heard			1
miss @entity28 , who is close to completing a phd , said that weekly weigh - ins can help slimmers keep track of their weight , allowing them to take action immediately if they notice the pounds creeping up again			1
the thought of stepping on the scales may also help stop people from giving into temptation			0
she said : ‘ perhaps it acts as a primer			0
if you know you have to step on the scales , you are a bit more careful about what you eat			0
’ researcher @entity28 said : ' perhaps it acts as a primer			0
if you know you have to step on the scales , you are a bit more careful about what you eat ' writing in the @entity74 , she said : ‘ many people with weight problems take action to lose weight but almost invariably put it back on			1
' finding effective strategies to minimise this is critical			0
’ she is now working on a new study , looking at whether daily weigh - ins are even better at preventing those sneaky pounds piling back on			1
' daily weigh - ins would mean that any weight gain should be noticed more quickly			1
it should also make it easier to get into the habit of weighing yourself			2
curiously , daily weigh - ins only seem to help those who have already succeeded in losing weight to keep it off			1
studies show the strategy to be of little or no benefit to those still trying to lose weight			0
previous research has shown that to stay at a new weight , slimmers need to eat less than someone of the same weight who has not dieted .			2

researchers looked at *1,000* slimmers who continued weighing themselves
those in the ' weigh - in ' group gained almost half a stone less than others
