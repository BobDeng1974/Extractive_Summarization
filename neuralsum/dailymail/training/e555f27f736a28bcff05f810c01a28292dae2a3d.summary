a huge shoal of sardines surrounded unsuspecting diver in seas off the @entity4 allowing them to capture amazing picture of a breathtaking natural phenomenon			0
the shoal was captured on camera by @entity9 on the last dive of her trip off the coast of the small @entity13 which is close to @entity14 in centre of the @entity17 country			0
the magnificent spectacle , known as a sardine run , sees the silver fish swimming in tight formation to create a shimmering wall of fish during their annual migration to warmer waters			1
breathtaking : the huge schoal of sardines surrounds a diver as the fish swirl through the water in their thousands near @entity13 in the @entity4 the run happens in the region from may through to july when billions of sardines spawn in the cool waters of southern @entity36 and move north along the east coast and into the @entity38			1
ms @entity9 , who is from @entity39 , said : ' we were exploring the abundance of marine life - frog fish , moray eels , octopi , sea snakes when suddenly the sky grew dark as if overcast with unexpected clouds			1
' i looked up and there were thousands , no millions of sardines moving as one organism			2
their moving mass was blocking the sun turning day into night			2
it was so mesmerising that everyone froze to watch the monster in action			0
' overhead : the migrating fish gather over the head of a diver in the @entity4 coming together in thick clouds that are dense enough to block out the sun phenomenon : the sardines swirl through the sea in their thousands every year as the migrate from the seas off @entity36 to the @entity38 in unison : the sardines swim in their thousands around a diver creating a wave like shape in the sea near the small @entity13 in the @entity4 one of @entity9 's photographs looks like the sardines have taken on the form of a whale , while others depict the sardines in a whirlwind like formation			1
she said : ' we would swim into the shoal and lose track of reality not being able to tell which way was the sky or the seabed			0
the shoal was so powerful it kept pulling us down and further off course			0
' i was trying hard not to lose sense of direction			0
it also kept changing shapes , one minute it would open wide and the next shrink into a tight ball			0
' the sardine run is happens when the fish migrate to a better breeding ground with more food such as plankton			1
they travel together for protection , but their size of the run mean predators often enjoy a feeding frenzy			2
sight : two divers admiring nature at work as the shoal of sardines rear up together into thick cyclone shaped clouds as they swim packed in tightly together			1

the millions of fish were packed together so tightly that they blocked out the sun *disorientating* stunned divers
the *spectacular* run happens during the fish 's annual migration to the warmer waters of the @entity38
