by @entity0 the tenants who last year found out that they had been living with the dead bodies of a murdered couple buried in their garden have said they have no intention of moving			1
@entity7 said she and her 15 - year - old daughter , who live at the property in @entity10 where @entity11 and @entity12 shot and killed @entity13 and @entity14 in 1998 , will not move out			1
ms @entity7 spoke out as the @entity12 , who successfully hid their crime for 16 , were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of @entity13 , 85 and 63 - year - old @entity14			1
behind bars : @entity11 and @entity12 have been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of killing her parents @entity13 and @entity14 in @entity10 , in 1998 ‘ a lot of people have said , “ how can you possibly still live there ? ” , ’ she told the @entity23			1
‘ but i love our home			0
we have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times here			0
' ms @entity7 said she ‘ never really thought anything ’ of the area in her garden where grass would not grow , where it would later emerge the @entity37 had been buried in a shallow grave just a few feet down			1
‘ we used to have birthday parties in the garden , which my young nieces and nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area			0
my nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and i just think , “ how close , how close ”			0
’ for years , @entity11 , 56 , and @entity12 , 57 , kept claiming the @entity37 ' benefits , stealing £ 245,000 from them , and conning friends and relatives that they were still alive			1
no clue : the current tenant of the house where the @entity37 were murdered and buried has said she never gave much thought to the patch in her garden where grass would not grow not moving : ms @entity7 has said that despite having lived with two bodes leaving their home the @entity12 , who were found guilty of murder last week , have to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars , a judge at @entity62 ruled			1
sentencing the pair , mrs justice @entity66 said the @entity12 had created ‘ an elaborate charade ’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the @entity37			2
she said the facts of the case were ‘ so serious and your culpability so high ’ that she had no choice but impose minimum terms of 25 years each , for each of the two murders , to run concurrently			0
the court heard that the debt - ridden couple shot their victims at their home in @entity10 , @entity84 on the may bank holiday , with the couple then buried in a metre - deep hole in their own back garden			1
for the next 15 years , the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that mr @entity92 , 85 , and his 63 - year - old wife were alive			1
the debt - ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘ reclusive ’ @entity97 were still alive and had simply moved away , faking their signatures on official documents , and sending @entity101 cards and letters apparently from them to family members			0
as a result , they were able to rake in almost £ 250,000 in pensions , credit , and the sale of the @entity92 ’s home - much of which celebrity - obsessed @entity11 , who also felt her parents had ‘ swindled ’ her out of a £ 10,000 inheritance in the 1970s , spent on correspondence signed by her favourite stars			1
the 56 - year - old was fixated with powerful older men - including @entity120 actors @entity118 and @entity121 , legendary football manager @entity122 , entertainer @entity123 , and political giants @entity124 and general @entity126			2
shallow grave : the bodies of @entity92 and mrs @entity14 were discovered wrapped in bedding in a makeshift grave in their back garden last october the judge said the @entity12 had created ' an elaborate charade ' which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the @entity37 their elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until 2012 when the @entity139 of the @entity140 wrote to mr @entity92 , who would would have been approaching his 100th birthday , and asked for a face - to - face meeting			1
the @entity12 panicked and fled their council home in @entity145 , @entity146 , to @entity147 in northern @entity148 , renting a flat which they paid for in cash			2
@entity12 , who could speak fluent @entity148 , attempted to find work but was unsuccessful			2
by october last year , they were fast running out of cash			0
in desperation , @entity12 , 57 , called his stepmother , @entity156 , back in the @entity157 to ask for money - then went on the stunning revelation that the @entity37 were buried in their garden			1
revelations : the judge accepted accusations from mrs @entity156 that her father , @entity92 ( pictured ) had abused her he also gave her the version of events that the @entity12 to stick to during their police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the conversation finished			1
stunned detectives then made the grim discovery of the @entity14 ’s remains buried three feet beneath their former lawn , and contacted @entity12 using phone numbers and an email address he had given his stepmother			1
he eventually replied and arranged to return to the @entity157 , and the couple were arrested at @entity180 railway station a month after the @entity37 were unearthed			0
the only possessions the @entity12 , who had just one @entity183 left to their name , brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia			2
included were five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star @entity121 , which @entity11 had splashed out more than £ 14,000 on during 2009 and 2011			2
it was a sign of @entity11 ’s obsession with celebrities , a fascination which the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself posing as the @entity148 actor @entity118			2
the fake 14 - year correspondence , between 1992 and 2006 , even deceived her own husband , with @entity11 acquiring a machine to make it seem as though the letters had a @entity148 postmark			1
despite stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the @entity37 , including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for £ 66,000 in 2005 , the @entity12 remain deep in debt , owing around £ 160,000 to creditors			2
sentencing the couple on monday , mrs @entity207 described the killings as ‘ shocking crimes ’			1
she told the ‘ self - contained couple ’ that so far as they were concerned ‘ only the two of you mattered ’			0
the judge told @entity217 , who sat staring intently from the dock wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses , that she was ‘ an accomplished liar and a fantasist ’			0
mrs @entity207 accepted ‘ on balance ’ that she had told the truth about being sexually abused by mr @entity92 as a child and that had formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father			0
‘ that background may explain why you hated him , which you did , and why you have no remorse about killing him , ’ she said			0
the judge said she did not believe mrs @entity14 had ever known of that abuse , as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her			1
lies and deceit : a letter forged by the @entity12 from @entity92 asking that his benefits and pensions payments be paid directly into a numbered bank account , dated around six moths after the murders in 1998 evidence : police believe this second world war commando colt .38 calibre revolver was used in the murders in @entity84 in 1998 mrs @entity207 added that she was satisfied it was @entity12 ‘ who held the gun ’ and who shot the pensioners in the back bedroom of their semi-detached home , and not as the couple claimed , @entity217			1
during mitigation pleas , @entity217 ’s barrister @entity260 described her abuse at her father ’s hands as ‘ an ongoing feature ’ of her life ‘ that created in her , some would say , the justifiable hatred of him and would be akin to a slow - burning , festering provocation that may explain in some way some part of why it happened ’			0
mr @entity273 spoke of the ‘ disdain ’ his client alleged her father had then shown her in later life , including ‘ his rejection of the only man in her life , and the man she loved , @entity12 ’			0
he said mrs @entity156 had no children , no friends and was facing the prospect of jail apart from her husband , adding that her crime ‘ already made her a target ’ behind bars , although he did not elaborate			0
mr @entity273 added : ‘ the upshot is she will effectively serve her prison term in circumstances akin to isolation , and from her point of view she will be parted from her husband , which is undoubtedly a life punishment			0
’ mrs @entity299 said that she sentenced the pair ‘ on the basis that each of you intended that both @entity92 and mrs @entity14 should be shot dead			2
’ she added their sentences had to reflect the serious nature of the double killing , telling them they had planned to shoot their two victims - one of whom was in his 80s - for financial gain			0
for the offences of obstructing a coroner and theft , both of which the couple admitted before trial , they were each handed a prison term of five years and four years respectively , to run concurrently			0
neither defendant appeared to react as they were jailed , with the pair led down from the dock in silence .			0
