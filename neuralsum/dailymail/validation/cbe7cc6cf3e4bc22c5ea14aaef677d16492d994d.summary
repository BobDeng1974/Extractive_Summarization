killer co-pilot @entity0 was concerned he was losing his eyesight , possibly because of a detached retina - with his vision already restricted to 30 per cent , it was claimed today			1
the condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients - and is often marked by flashes in the eye			1
earlier today , @entity15 revealed that @entity0 was living ‘ on the edge ’ because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot ’s licence			1
@entity30 newspaper @entity36 reported that it was unclear whether @entity0 ’s vision problems had physical or psychological causes			1
meanwhile , another report in @entity41 from @entity42 claimed @entity0 ’s vision was at just 30 per cent at the time of the crash , which saw the 27 - year - old fly his @entity47 into a @entity41 mountainside			1
the @entity15 told how investigators believe his eyesight problems - coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long - term girlfriend - triggered the ‘ madness ’ that ended in mass murder			1
@entity0 masked his true condition – described by police as ‘ severe burnout syndrome ’ – from his employers and was aided by @entity30 confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was			1
but police still do n’t know whether his vision problems , which are understood to have begun several years ago , were caused by his psychological condition or whether , as one officer said , he was in fact ‘ slowly going blind ’			1
it is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher @entity65 , 26 , but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages			2
one friend said : ‘ he tried to order her what to wear , what men she could speak to , even the length of her skirts			2
he was a control freak of the highest order			2
’ another friend added : ‘ she said he was very kind and attentive , but that he had problems with mood swings			2
and i think we sensed that she became more fearful over time			2
’ the break , according to friends , came just weeks ago			2
she still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor - girl flat			1
frantic that he would lose her , @entity0 splashed out thousands of pounds buying two @entity90 cars			1
he took delivery of one vehicle just five days before tuesday ’s horror			2
break : @entity65 still lived with @entity0 in his @entity96 flat ( pictured ) but was looking for a new place his obsessive need to be in charge extended even to fast food			1
@entity101 , who runs a pizza restaurant near @entity0 ’s @entity96 home , said : ‘ he was extremely particular about pizza toppings			1
' he was n’t interested in what was on the menu			2
it was often paprika , ham , onion and broccoli			2
he had to have it his way			2
he was compulsive about it			2
’ yesterday , it was revealed by police that @entity0 suffered from a ‘ severe psychosomatic sickness ’ that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists			1
police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in @entity96 and from his parental home in the small @entity127 town of @entity128			0
police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in @entity30			0
they particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his @entity47 into a @entity41 mountainside , killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew			1
desperate : frantic that he would lose her , @entity0 splashed out thousands of pounds buying two @entity90 cars on friday , it was revealed that his illness was so chronic that he had multiple sick notes from doctors , including one issued to him for the day of the disaster , discarded and ripped up in his home			1
the disintegration of his eyesight , according to investigators , fuelled his chronic anxiety that his flying career – the career he lived for since he was a teenager – was coming to an end			1
as the jigsaw puzzle of his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators , the agony of his murder - suicide mission struck at the heart of his home town of @entity128 , for ever changed because of the actions of a @entity165 figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives			1
on the surface , he projected stability , confidence and calm : the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents ’ home wearing his crisp @entity176 uniform			1
he was a fanatical runner , and he liked discos , cars , cooking and music			0
recovery : rescue helicopters continued to search the @entity183 today for further signs of wreckage but his insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray @entity65 with a five - month fling with a @entity176 stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working			1
‘ he was always seeking assurances about the way he looked and the way he was viewed by others , ’ said the former lover , identified only as @entity194 , 26			0
she painted a portrait of a ‘ tormented and erratic ’ man who would wake up from nightmares screaming : ‘ we ’re going down , we ’re going down ! ’ she added : ‘ he once told me he would do something to change the whole system , that the world would know his name and remember him			0
’ he lived up to the macabre promise when he smashed his aircraft into a mountainside on tuesday when the emotional volcano within him finally erupted			0
his mind disorders , despite treatment , could no longer be restrained			0
a spokesman for @entity217 , the parent company of the budget airline , said the carrier was unaware of a psychosomatic or any other illness affecting @entity0			1
last morning with my love , my prince ... heartbreaking tribute to @entity226 victim anguish : @entity228 with boyfriend @entity229 in a previous photograph the grief - stricken girlfriend of a @entity226 student killed in the @entity234 plane tragedy has revealed a poignant last photo of the young couple together			1

yesterday , a distraught @entity246 visited the monument erected near where the @entity248 crashed			0
his son was one of three @entity226 who lost their lives			0

i do n’t want it to be forgotten , ever			0
’ he added : ‘ i believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly			0
we put our lives and our children ’s lives in their hands			0
i want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person			0
’ many people took to @entity237 to offer ms @entity228 condolences in response to the photo she posted , with one friend saying ‘ he was the best guy you could ever meet ’			0
ms @entity228 , who is from @entity279 , replied : ‘ thank you ! he was			0
it is a big loss for everyone			0
how it can [ sic ] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way ... i just do n’t understand			0
’ mr @entity229 , from @entity288 , was studying hospitality and hotel management in @entity291 , @entity292 , where he was about to start an internship after travelling with ms @entity228			0

mr @entity229 was flying back to the @entity226 via @entity96 to see his family .			0
