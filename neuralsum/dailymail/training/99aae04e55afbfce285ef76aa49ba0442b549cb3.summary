by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:31 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 01:00 est , 26 october 2013 the long squeeze on the incomes of millions of families is coming to an end , @entity2 said yesterday , as growth figures showed the recovery is gathering pace			1
the @entity10 said @entity12 ’s economy grew by 0.8 per cent between july and september , the fastest rate recorded since the election			2
ministers seized on the figures as evidence that the government ’s austerity plan – which was bitterly opposed by @entity20 – is now bearing fruit			2
let the good times roll ? chancellor @entity2 visits @entity24 and @entity25 textile manufacturer in @entity26 as figures show the recovery gaining momentum gains : output in manufacturing is still 8.9 per cent lower than pre-recession levels , despite growing by 0.5 per cent in the latest quarter the chancellor said the recovery meant better times are in sight for millions of families who have seen their incomes squeezed since the 2008 crash			1
‘ @entity12 ’s hard work is paying off , ’ he said , adding : ‘ if @entity12 is growing , then the finances of @entity12 ’s families will start to grow			2
’ but mr @entity2 also warned that ‘ lots of risks remain ’ , and said there was still a long way to go to eliminate the vast budget deficit left by @entity20			1
@entity51 said the growth figure was ‘ not just a number on a graph ’ , but evidence that a sustained recovery is finally underway			1
the prime minister said he was determined that the benefits of growth would be shared by all parts of the country			1
‘ the gdp figures out today do show our economy has real momentum , ’ he said			2
‘ they show that we are on a path to prosperity			1
boost : the @entity12 economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to september , the @entity10 said today @entity70 @entity2 has every right to declare @entity12 is back on the path to prosperity after the economy recorded robust growth across the board in the three months to september			1
remarkably , @entity12 is now among the fastest expanding of the @entity78 nations , easily outpacing rivals such as @entity80 and @entity81			0
the main driving force behind surging output is the service sector , which comprises 75 per cent of the economy			0
that has now moved ahead of where it was at the peak of @entity91 ’s boom in 2008			1
the turnabout in economic fortunes will come as a huge relief to the government , which has found itself on the back foot for the last week as @entity12 ’s @entity98 energy firms raised prices			1
@entity20 ’s grudging response to nine months of solid output growth was to acknowledge it as ‘ good news ’			1
but shadow chancellor @entity103 could not resist a dig , noting that for millions ‘ standards of living are going down , not up ’			1
what @entity103 forgets to say is that in the @entity12 , unlike most of @entity109 , austerity has been far less painful because employers have had the confidence to expand the workforce			0
some 1.4million private sector jobs have been created since the @entity114 came to office in 2010			0
the faster the economy recovers , the better businesses will do and the easier it will be to restore living standards through honestly earned wage increases – rather than subsidy and welfare dependency			0
by far the biggest net contributor to the @entity12 ’s economic renaissance is business services – a sector often dismissed as coffee shops and haircuts			1
but the reality is that it comprises it , legal and accounting work , engineering consultancy and architecture as well as some of the leading creative industries			0
many of these sell products overseas			0
the figures also give the lie to the idea of a recovery built on a housing bubble			1
while both housing and construction are gaining momentum , growing by 2.5 per cent over the past three months , they are still 12.5 per cent below the peak of the @entity147 bubble in 2008			0
there is also some evidence that the economy is starting to rebalance , with manufacturing perking up by 0.9 per cent			0
the return to expansion is all the more encouraging in that the rest of @entity109 ( the @entity12 ’s biggest trading partner ) is still in slump and the @entity158 economy has been subsiding amid serious budget uncertainty			0
mr @entity2 will , for the first time since becoming chancellor , have far better growth forecasts to present in his autumn statement on december 4			1
there may even be a better outcome for the budget deficit as consumer and income tax receipts pick up			0
‘ we ’ve got a huge amount more to do to secure that recovery			1
above all , our work here in @entity109 and at home is about making sure it is a recovery for all – a recovery for north and south , for rich and poor , for people who have been excluded from our economy			1
’ the strengthening recovery is a major blow to the strategy of shadow chancellor @entity103 , who has repeatedly warned the government ’s austerity programme would strangle growth			1
yesterday mr @entity103 gave the @entity10 figures a cautious welcome , but warned that most families are still not feeling the benefit			1
squeeze : the @entity192 shows the cost of living is up 2.7 per cent , while wages are rising by less than one per cent mr @entity103 said : ‘ for millions of people across the country , still seeing prices rising faster than their wages , this is no recovery at all			1
’ @entity200 business secretary @entity200 also struck a cautious note , saying : ‘ we ’ve always said the road to recovery would be a marathon , not a sprint			2
’ economic growth in the third quarter of this year is the fastest since spring 2010 , built on 0.7 per cent growth in the second quarter of the year and 0.4 per cent in the first three months			1
ridicule : the @entity211 will take aim at @entity20 in an internet cartoon film entitled ' @entity214 , @entity216 's @entity215 ' falling : latest figures from the @entity10 show how the government is on course to borrow less this year than last year the @entity10 report showed all the main strands of the economy growing , with output in the dominant services sector up 0.7 per cent , manufacturing 0.9 per cent and construction 2.5 per cent			1
analysts said housebuilding was boosted by a surge in mortgage lending on the back of state - supported schemes such as @entity232			0
but the economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was in 2008 when boom turned to bust under @entity20			0
struggling : inflation is higher in the @entity12 than anywhere else in @entity109 , with food and energy driving up costs output shrank by 7.2 per cent in the recession and @entity12 remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century			0
the recent revival in @entity12 ’s economic fortunes has fuelled speculation that an early rise in interest rates is on the cards			2
but , speaking on thursday night just hours before the gdp figures were published , @entity250 governor @entity249 said the economy still lacks enough ‘ traction ’ to warrant a rate increase			0
big rises in energy prices are ‘ morally wrong ’ @entity51 said yesterday as senior sources said he was preparing to slash the average bill by £ 50			0
the prime minister took aim at the @entity98 energy companies , accusing them of putting up bills by far more than the amount wholesale gas prices have risen			2
at a press conference in @entity266 , mr @entity51 confirmed he wants to remove onerous green levies from the cost of fuel to cut prices for families			0
but he also admitted the costs were likely to be passed to general @entity273 has announced it will increase energy bills by 10.4 per cent from december , while @entity278 , @entity276 and @entity277 have all announced rises of between 8 and 9 per cent this winter			2
asked if such rises were ‘ morally wrong ’ when wholesale prices have risen by 3 per cent in recent months , mr @entity51 said : ‘ on power bills , i think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially			2
’ the controversial @entity288 rail line ‘ ca n’t go ahead ’ if @entity20 withdraws its support , @entity51 admitted yesterday			2
the prime minister , who also faces a major @entity211 rebellion on the £ 42billion project next week , said the scheme could collapse unless it retains all - party support			0
he said : ‘ these multi-year , multi-parliament infrastructure projects , they ca n’t go ahead without all - party support , we wo n’t get the investment , we ca n’t have the consistency			2
’ speculation is mounting that @entity20 is preparing to drop its backing for the project , which began life under the last @entity20 government			0
shadow chancellor @entity103 yesterday said it was ‘ irresponsible ’ of ministers to pledge to press ahead regardless of cost			1
labour sources say @entity310 has ‘ sub-contracted ’ the final decision on @entity288 to mr @entity103			0
mr @entity51 warned @entity20 would damage @entity12 ’s long - term prospects if it pulled the plug on the scheme			0
he said they would be ‘ letting down ’ the @entity316 and the @entity317 and would be turning their backs on business .			0

third quarter data follows growth of 0.4 **%** and 0.7 **%** already this year
boost for @entity2 's economic strategy that recovery is taking hold
but chancellor warns against *giveaways* with more ' difficult ' cuts ahead
he hails data as proof that ' the country is on the path to prosperity '
but *voters* not feeling the recovery , with wages *outstripped* by rising bills
