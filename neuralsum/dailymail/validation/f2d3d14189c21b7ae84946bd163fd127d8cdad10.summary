@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes they can go from strength to strength after winning the first trophy of @entity7 's reign			1
@entity7 is on course to become only the third @entity1 manager to win a domestic treble , after @entity11 and @entity12 , following his side 's @entity14 triumph on sunday			1
that added a new medal to @entity0 ' cabinet but the playmaker is not about to rest on his laurels ahead of the @entity22 quarter - final replay against @entity23 at @entity24			1
@entity0 put @entity1 ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions commons is congratulated by his team - mates having put the @entity32 leaders in front commons says his side will continue to grow under @entity7 after winning their first trophy the 31 - year - old appeared likely to leave the club in january as former @entity1 manager @entity39 targeted him for a move to @entity41 but the former @entity43 international went on to sign a two - year contract before netting the opener against @entity23 at @entity46 on sunday			1
and he is fully embracing @entity7 's quest to improve his team and players			1
commons said : ' i think we 're a better team than last season			1
on paper we set really high standards with the clean sheet record , goals scored and points tally			1
i think this time last season the league was done and dusted			0
it 's hard to say we are a better team but i feel like we are in a better place			1
' we 've not reached the top			0
it 's not like we 've conquered it and that 's where we need to be , we will still be looking to make improvements and progress year - in , year - out			1
' if we do win the treble we will be looking to do it again next year and the year after then add @entity72 group stages and try to get last - 16			1
@entity1 boss @entity7 enters the dressing room with a smile on his face after winning the @entity76 @entity7 says he is finally beginning to enjoy life at @entity1 after a slow start , now he has lifted his first trophy ' you 've got to keep striving for greatness			1
if you think you 've reached the top and stand still that 's when you start going backwards			2
' commons , who admitted his own season had been a ' rollercoaster ' , added : ' when a new manager comes in , it 's very difficult to make it seamless			2
he is a different nationality , we had a few new players and we were n't achieving the style of play he wanted			0
changes take time and now we are seeing the benefits			0
' commons ' words were music to @entity7 's ears as the @entity103 continues to wipe out early impressions of him following @entity1 's poor @entity72 qualifying campaign			1
' i think we have progressed a lot in the things i want to bring into the culture and how we want to work , ' he said			0
' i 'm starting to really enjoy it			0
in the beginning it 's enough to be there , you do n't know where to start			2
now it 's settled , everybody knows their role and what 's expected , and now we have to work better than we have done before			0
' there is so much to go but that will never stop			0
but we have done a good job so far and we just have to keep working in the same way , and i think we will get even better results			2
the @entity1 players celebrate on the podium with the @entity76 after beating @entity23 2 - 0 ' when you are at a club like @entity1 , the pressure is so unbelievably high so everybody in the club is always thinking about results			1
and that 's the wrong way of thinking in my opinion , but it 's very hard not to do it			0
' so everything has been an environment that 's all about results , then you do n't get any creativity because you are so afraid to do something different			0
to get that culture of development , to get people to get into what to do every day and try to improve things , that has been the biggest challenge for me			0
' winning and developing , individually and as a team , i think we are getting that message across			2
people understand that we want to get the best out of them and the players are getting very interested in doing the things to improve themselves			0
@entity7 hopes to become the third @entity1 manager to achieve a domestic treble after his first triumph goalscorers @entity157 and commons pose with the @entity76 final trophy in front of the fans ' it 's all about tempo			1
they are much lighter , as a team we have dropped 50 kilos in six months			2
things are getting quicker and sharper in training			0
it 's not only a physical thing , it 's also a tactical thing that you have to work in the intensity you want to play , maybe higher			0
' @entity7 is not about to make major changes to freshen things up in the third of their four consecutive matches against @entity23			1
' if you are good at something you have to continue doing what you are good at , not start doing something else , ' he said			1
' we want to build on what we are good at and do that even better			2
i 'm not into surprising opponents so much			0
i want them to fear us for what we are - they know what 's coming and do n't know how to handle it			0
that 's our goal in the future			2

@entity0 scored first goal in the @entity14 final
@entity1 on course for a domestic treble after slow start under @entity7
commons and @entity7 both *confident* that team are making good progress
