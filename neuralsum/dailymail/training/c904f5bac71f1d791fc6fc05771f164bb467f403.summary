by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 motorsport boss @entity2 has suggested one of his drivers will require psychological counselling should they lose this year 's @entity8 title by the controversial double - points system			1
for the final race of the campaign , which this year will be in @entity13 in november , the top 10 drivers will collect twice the normal amount of points for a race , with the winner enjoying 50			1
when announced in december , fans worldwide vehemently criticised @entity21 supremo @entity20 's plan , believing it to be too artificial and a disservice to the sport			0
unfair : @entity2 has condemned the controversial double - points system @entity2 has never been a fan either , and with it now becoming patently obvious either @entity26 or @entity27 will win the crown , he has openly joined the chorus of condemnation			1
following a @entity34 @entity33 won by @entity27 , with @entity26 a superb third after starting from 20th on the grid to limit the damage to his team - mate , the gap between the two is now 14 points			1
with it likely to remain nip and tuck between them over the second half of the season , @entity2 said : ' i would be very surprised if it did n't come down to @entity13 , to the very famous double points			1
' it means even if you 're 30 points behind then you can turn it around in @entity13 if the leading guy retires			2
' so maybe @entity20 was right , that double points is going to keep the championship open until the last race			2
jubilant : @entity27 celebrates his @entity34 @entity33 win with @entity3 ' but i do n't think it 's fair			1
i do n't think we should have done it			0
' the reason we did was because the commercial rights holder is head of sponsorship and he cares about the tv audience and the need to keep the excitement until the end , the last race			0
' as i said , it looks like he might be right , that the last race is going to be the decisive one , and i would be very surprised if the audiences were n't considerably higher than they would normally be			0
' should a driver lose by such a system , @entity2 believes it would be hard for that man to bear			1
' neither of them will care if they won it that way , ' added @entity2			2
' but the one who loses on double points will need some psychological treatment - although we 're not there yet			1
' winner : @entity27 drives during the @entity34 @entity33 at @entity89 on sunday @entity90 signs @entity91 from @entity26 's perspective , to claim via double points what would be his second world title is irrelevant in his eyes			2
' i want to win it , ' said @entity26			0
' i 'm not going to get to the end of the season , and if i won it that way , say i did n't want to win it that way			0
i just want to win the world championship			0
' it 's not just that one race that will decide it , but all the races before and how i performed before that will characterise the way i feel about it			0

@entity3 boss claims one of his drivers with need psychological treatment ' if they lose thanks to the double - points system
