unconventional diet : @entity1 has lost over ten stone by eating curry for breakfast every morning a father has lost more than ten stone in less than a year with an unconventional diet that includes curries for breakfast every morning			1
@entity1 , 38 , from @entity9 , invented his own unique diet that involved wolfing down a vindaloo every morning at 6am			1
the meal plan has led to him going from 24st to 13st 13lbs in just 11 months			2
the delivery driver 's eating habits became similar to those recommended on the fast diet - as he would gorge on his favourite foods until 10am but then eat little else all day			1
@entity1 would always start with a hearty helping of vindaloo to fire up his metabolism and then ate anything else he fancied , which satisfied his cravings for the day			1
he would then just have a light snack such as a bowl of soup in the evening			2
the bizarre approach to dieting has worked wonders for @entity1 who is now slimmer than he 's ever been			1
he had piled on the pounds thanks to his job as constantly being on the move making deliveries meant the father - of - two had to grab whatever he could to eat			2
as a result , he used to gorge on cakes and chocolates while making deliveries to supermarkets			0
he would also stop off at burger vans between rounds and stock up on bacon butties and other fatty meals			0
it was in january this year that @entity1 finally decided to make a change when a colleague commented on how out of breath he was after hitching up his trailer			1
so @entity1 devised his own way of going about dieting as he found traditional approaches were not effective			1
he said : ' i wanted to go about dieting a different way to how you would expect			0
the problem for me is that if someone tells me i ca n't eat something i just want to eat it even more			0
' so i decided i wanted to do a diet that would mean i could eat whatever i wanted			1
as he was : @entity1 put on weight as he used to snack on cakes and chocolates and stop at burger vans for lunch as he worked as a delivery driver now : @entity1 starts his day with a vindaloo at 6am everyday but says he keeps his diet interesting by adding different ingredients to his favourite @entity74 dish ' the point of eating at six in the morning is that it takes away the cravings for the rest of the day			1
' i carried on eating the same things , so lots of carbs and sugars , until 10am			2
' despite the consistency of his diet @entity1 says he is not yet bored of curry and has found ways of keeping his meals exciting			1
' i have a chicken vindaloo every morning			1
i have it a bit differently everyday to keep it interesting			0
' i 'll have salad with baby leaves one day and others i 'll add broccoli or tinned veg			2
' amazingly , @entity1 has not undertaken any extra exercise and says his incredible weight loss is down to diet alone			1
@entity1 is thrilled with his impressive weight loss but says his girlfriend was happier when he was larger as well as his physical change , @entity1 says that since his weight loss he has a far more positive demeanor			1
' in recent months clothes shopping has been amazing , i feel like i have finally been able to work out what kind of person i am , ' he said			0
' i also find that when i am out and about people start talking to me that would n't have before and also the other way around - i 'm not worried about approaching other people as well			0
' he added : ' i 'm so much happier now			0
my daughters think i 'm a completely different man			0
they love taking me shopping now			0
' however , not everyone is completely happy with his transformation			0
' it took my girlfriend a while to get used to it			2
i was 23 stone when she met me			0
' she finds it weird - she says i 'm not the same man that i used to be			0
she 's not happy with me ! '			0
