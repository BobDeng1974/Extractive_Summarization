another reckless couple were caught on camera pushing their baby ’s buggy over the crossing despite the red warning lights clearly flashing in front of them			1
the youngster , dressed in his school uniform , sprinted across the busy railway tracks despite the flashing warning lights and lowering barrier			0
he made it across in front of the train but then appeared oblivious to the danger he had put himself in			1
madness : @entity26 ignores warning lights and runs across a level crossing in @entity30 , @entity31 , on november 22 , as the barrier comes down in a hurry ? couple with baby in pushchair ignore the waring lights to walk over level crossing moments seconds before the safety barriers come down the reckless pedestrians all ignored warning signs where four people have died in recent years at the crossing in @entity30 , @entity31			1
@entity43 for @entity30 @entity44 said today that the level crossing has been a ' chronic problem ' for many years			1
he said : " @entity47 have regularly done awareness campaigns , but peoplestill feel the need to jump the gate			0
' i have been down there with representatives from @entity47 talking to people about how to be safe and raising awareness			0
' people have the ' it wo n't happen to me ' attitude			0
it is true that 99 per cent of people will get away with it , but it only takes one who does not for there to be a serious accident with tragic consequences			1
' even if the train has slowed down for the nearby station and is only going at 10mph it will still kill a child and probably an adult too			0
' that particular crossing has been a chronic problem for several years			1
there have been horrendous stories of near misses and tragic deaths on the crossing			1
' it is not just @entity30 that has this problem it is like this across the country			1
' the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) today warned that the consequences of the schoolboy and parent ’s actions could have been ' horrific			1

and a fourth person @entity103 , 53 , died after he was hit by a train on the level crossing just before 10am on january 15 , 2010			2
he said : ' the actions of these people are absolutely unbelievable			0
' they were clearly willing to risk their lives to nip across the tracks either to get where they were going more quickly or just for the sake of causing mischief			0
' this time they were lucky , but we have seen many incidents in which others have not been as fortunate			0
' barriers are in place at level crossings to keep motorists and pedestrians safe from harm and , when used correctly , that is exactly what they achieve			0
' however , when barriers and signals are ignored , the consequences can be horrific			1
we ask all motorists and pedestrians to exercise a little patience			0
' the shocking picture shows the boy running across the tracks where the railway line crosses @entity138 close to @entity139 in @entity30 , @entity31 , on november 22			1
his school uniform suggests he is a pupil at the nearby @entity141 in @entity142 , @entity30 , @entity31			1
headteacher @entity143 today said : ' i hope this incident reminds all students - and members of the public - about the importance of road safety			0
' we will continue to impress on our students the importance of all aspects of safety			0
but this is n’t just an issue for the school , it ’s an issue for society			0
' several people have died at the @entity138 level crossing in @entity30 in recent years			1
@entity91 , 19 , died instantly from multiple injuries after he was hit by a train on the crossing after a night out in august 2007			2

@entity203 , @entity47 community safety manager , said : ' despite ongoing safety campaigns , hard - hitting television adverts and rail safety schemes in schools which highlight the dangers , it is disappointing that people of all ages continue to misuse the level crossings in @entity30			1
' we appreciate it can be frustrating to wait for trains to pass through but there is no excuse for level - crossing misuse			2
' to avoid loss of life , injury , damage to vehicles and causing delays to passengers , always obey the warning sequence and never attempt to cross the railway when it has started			0
' the shocking pictures of people risking their lives by ignoring the warning signals at level crossing were taken as part of an investigation into dangerous behaviour at the crossing by a local paper			2
@entity47 statistics show that the number of deaths on level crossings is decreasing from 10 in 2008/2009 , eight in 2009/2010 , six in 2010/2011 and four in 2011/2012			0
but @entity47 said despite the decrease they are continually trying to educate people of all ages about the dangers of misusing level crossings .			0
