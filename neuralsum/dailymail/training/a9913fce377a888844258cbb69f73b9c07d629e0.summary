by @entity0 @entity2 scientists are tracking an iceberg eight times the size of @entity5 in a groundbreaking bid to prevent a disaster			1
experts are monitoring the massive iceberg - which broke off a glacier in @entity12 - following fears it could drift into world shipping lanes			2
the giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles ( 700 square km )			1
@entity2 scientists are tracking an iceberg ( pictured ) the size of @entity5 in a bid to prevent a disaster in ocean shipping lanes			1
the giant iceberg measures roughly 270 square miles ( 700 square km ) the huge chunk of ice could survive for a year or more and the researchers hope to stop it becoming a hazard by predicting the path it will take			1
@entity28 around this size split from glaciers on average every two years worldwide , but this is the first tracking attempt of its kind			1
using satellite technology , it ’s being funded by a 50,000 pound urgency grant from @entity38 ( @entity39 )			0
expert dr @entity40 , from @entity41 and @entity42 at the @entity43 , @entity44 , is investigating as part of the project			0
the iceberg ( ringed in red ) could survive for a year or more and the researchers hope to stop it becoming a hazard by predicting the path it will take the @entity54 is shown separating from the @entity12 continent in this image taken by @entity59 's @entity58 satellite on november 10 he says the iceberg could cross into a ship ’s path in the @entity41			1
dr @entity40 said : ' the primary reason to monitor the iceberg is that it ’s very large			2
an iceberg is a large chunk of frozen of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water			1
the word ' iceberg ' has its roots in the @entity77 word ' ijsberg ' which means ' ice mountain '			1
because of the density of pure ice is lower than that of sea water , typically only one - ninth of the volume of an iceberg floats above water			2
in addition to this , the shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface			0
when a piece of iceberg ice melts , it makes a fizzing sound called ' @entity96 '			2
this sound is made when the water reaches ice that contains trapped compressed air bubbles			0
as this happens , each bubble bursts , making a ' popping ' sound			0
the bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice , that eventually got buried to a given depth ( up to several km ) and pressurised as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice			2
[ ' an iceberg of this size could survive for a year or longer and it could drift a long way north in that time and end up in the vicinity of world shipping lanes in the @entity41			1
' there ’s a lot of activity to and from the @entity120 , and ships could potentially cross paths with this large iceberg , although it would be an unusual coincidence			0
' the team will use their results to more accurately model the paths of future large icebergs			0
these are likely to become more common as global warming encourages glacier calving - where ice breaks off of the end of a glacier			0
investigators from @entity135 , @entity136 for @entity137 and @entity138 , are tracking the iceberg using earth observation satellites @entity141 from the @entity142 ( @entity142 )			2
principal investigator professor @entity143 says large amounts of freshwater from the melting iceberg could affect ocean currents			0
prof @entity143 , of the @entity148 , said : ' if the iceberg stays around the @entity120 coast , it will melt slowly and eventually add a lot of freshwater that stays in that coastal current , altering the density and affecting the speed of the current			0
an iceberg twice the size of @entity5 ( ringed ) tore away from one of @entity161 's largest glaciers in july last year			1
@entity59 satellites revealed when broke away completely , freeing an iceberg measuring 46 square miles ' similarly , if it moves north it will melt faster but it could alter the overturning rates of the current as it may create a cap of freshwater above the denser seawater			1
' this glacier is not large enough to have a big impact , but it could have an effect			0
' particularly if these events become more common , there will be a build - up of freshwater which could have lasting effects			0
