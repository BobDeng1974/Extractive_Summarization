half of the field had yet to complete their rounds when play was abandoned for the day at 6pm and more rain which flooded the course caused further disruption on saturday			1

' i 'm quite happy , played nicely and left a few out there to be honest , which is nice to say considering i was probably the worst golfer on the @entity25 last year ! ' @entity44 said			0
' it 's been blowing a hurricane back home so it 's kind of what i 've been practising in anyway			2
it 's the first time i 've been on a golf course and enjoyed it for maybe a year so i 'm looking forward to tomorrow			2
' i feel very refreshed after taking a little break from the game			0
the driver is a lot better and that was the thing that was killing me last year , but you work twice as hard when you 're playing badly and i was doing more than i should have been doing , working on the wrong things			0
' it feels better , the time away helped to refresh the brain a little bit and if i enjoy it i 'll play all right			0
i do n't care how i do at the moment as long as i enjoy it			0
' it 's a major for us on the @entity71 , the biggest one of the year so with me certainly , being selfish , i definitely want to get the second round in so i can get a pay cheque and some money onto the rankings			2
' after just one round it 's going to be an absolute rat race with a huge number of people on the same scores			0
it 'll be a shotgun start so it 's not like you 'll be under the cosh coming down the stretch because you 'll never know where the scores will come from			0
' players are driven back to the clubhouse after play is suspended on saturday in @entity90 @entity36 's @entity35 leads a congested field on four under par heading into sunday			1
