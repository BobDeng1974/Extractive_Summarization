a delicate pink peony perched atop her @entity3 hat and her neat @entity5 coat falling in razor sharp pleated folds to her knees , the @entity0 could n't have chosen a more appropriate ensemble yesterday			1
from the soft cream colour of the coat came a subtle nod to white , the colour of peace , while the summery bloom echoed the fresh flowers laid on the war memorial at @entity18 cemetery in @entity19 by her husband , prince @entity20			1
and the @entity22 was n't the only one to send a message with her clothes			0
queen @entity26 of the @entity27 chose a delicate soft blue , a colour redolent of motherhood , peace and tranquilty			1
the centenary of the outbreak of war was not a day for black mourning garb and poppies			0
at the time , the declaration of war was greeted with excitement as young men flocked to the recruiting offices			0
although some , among them foreign secretary sir @entity63 , whose gloomy prediction that ' the lamps are going out all over @entity66 ' inspired the @entity45 service , were apprehensive , many more welcomed war			2
that excitement swiftly turned to sorrow as the trenches filled up and millions perished makes the jubilation that greeted the outbreak of war all the more poignant			0
opening salvo : @entity18 is just outside @entity19 , where the first @entity75 battle of the @entity76 was fought tribute : @entity78 read from a @entity79 while prince @entity80 read a letter from pte @entity82 contemplation : the @entity44 represented the @entity26 at a memorial service at @entity45 tribute : the ceremony ended with a candle being extinguished beside the grave of the unknown soldier mourning : the @entity26 remembered the dead during a private ceremony in @entity50 on the @entity51 subtle : the monarch , like @entity92 and @entity0 , picked a subtle coat and hat in a pale hue for her visit to the church poignant too were the letters read out during the service at @entity18 , among them one from private @entity82 to his brother @entity102 which was read out by @entity80 and ended : ' i shall see you again when this is done			1
' he died a few days after the letter was written			0
also remembered were the @entity27 victims of the first day of the @entity76 , with the city of @entity43 , the first port of call for the royal mourners , subjected to a fearsome bombardment and an 11 day siege			2
' we were enemies more than once in the last century , ' said prince @entity20 during a speech made at the @entity117 to president @entity118 of @entity119 and president @entity120 of @entity121 among others			2
' today we are friends and allies			0
' after commending the @entity27 's fighting retreat on the 4th august 1914 , he added : ' their resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great			2
' @entity130 came the first major clash of the war : the @entity19 , which , although those joyous soldiers signing up 100 years ago yesterday did n't know it , would turn into a bloodstained disaster			1
hello there ! the @entity37 and @entity0 and prince @entity80 wave to excited crowds in @entity19 memorial : the couple and prince @entity80 attended a reception at @entity139 ahead of a memorial service lovely to meet you : @entity0 chats to @entity142 and @entity26 @entity26 while @entity20 meets @entity144 's @entity143 on their way : the @entity37 and @entity0 arrive at a reception at @entity139 in @entity27 at @entity18 , the graves include those of 229 @entity75 and @entity153 soldiers and 284 @entity119 , the majority of whom were killed during the battle			1
the fighting , which began with a @entity75 attempt to hold the @entity19 – @entity157 fail after a sudden @entity121 retreat , lasted for more than two weeks			2
although the @entity119 army came close to taking @entity160 , @entity75 and @entity121 victories in the @entity162 that followed saw the invaders pushed back before the war got bogged down in stalemate and trenches			0
but on the 4th august 1914 , none of the men then signing up knew that and they would n't know for some time to come			0
@entity33 in her cream coat and the little girl dressed in white who released a matching balloon during the @entity43 ceremony were both offering a sartorial tribute to the precious thing those men willingly threw away - peace			1
it would be another four years before they saw it again			0
praise : @entity0 looks solemn as @entity20 gets up to make a speech in which he paid tribute to the @entity27 sacrifice watchful : the @entity37 and @entity0 and president @entity120 look on as the ceremony begins symbolic : during the ceremony , a girl dressed in white released a balloon in front of @entity27 's @entity142 royal arrival : @entity0 and @entity20 with @entity142 and @entity26 of the @entity27 in @entity43 silence : the dignitaries , including @entity143 of @entity144 ( fourth from right ) , stood for a minute 's silence sombre : the @entity37 makes a speech paying tribute to the fallen at the @entity117 solemn : the scene outside @entity201 this morning as the memorial ceremony began			1

@entity33 wore cream in a nod to the peace that ended 100 years ago
her choice was echoed by the @entity44 and the @entity26
pretty peony atop her hat referenced floral tributes left to the fallen
queen @entity26 of the @entity27 also nodded to peace in tranquil blue
@entity20 , @entity0 and @entity80 were at the @entity18 cemetery in @entity19
the @entity44 represented the @entity26 at @entity45
