early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested			2
scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans			1
a study of fossils of @entity11 , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully			1
the above skeletons of @entity11 were reconstructed from fossils that the researchers used in their study this would have enabled @entity11 to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey			1
dr @entity31 , an anthropologist at the @entity32 in @entity33 , said : ' the combination of inferiorly rotated , human - like shoulders with a tall , mobile waist and low humeral torsion , support @entity11 as the first known hominin possessing the full anatomical complex associated with proficient throwing			1
55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - @entity43 ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve			0
later , chimp and human lineages diverge 5.5 million years ago - @entity50 , early ‘ proto - human ’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas 4 million years ago - @entity52 appeared			0
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.8 million years ago - @entity56 350 - 1 appeared and may be the first of the @entity59 family 2.7 million years ago - @entity60 , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.3 million years ago - @entity59 habalis first thought to have appeared in @entity63 1.8 million years ago - @entity64 begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - @entity67 axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths			2
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - @entity73 first begin to appear and spread across @entity74 and @entity75 200,000 years ago - @entity77 - modern humans - appear in @entity63 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach @entity74 ' while direct evidence of early throwing behavior remains elusive , evidence for the intensification of hominin carnivory and hunting behavior dating back two million years is increasing			1
' we propose that this increased carnivory was facilitated by a flexible , situation - dependent hunting and scavenging strategy that included high - speed throwing			2
' in the study , which is published in the @entity91 , compared the shoulder and collar bone sizes with modern humans and other species			1
they also examined the throwing ability of boys and men from the @entity101 tribes living around @entity102 in north west @entity103 and south western @entity104			1
@entity101 boys use bent throwing sticks called ' shar ' to hunt small game and herd lifestock while adults will also hunt with spears			1
the researchers asked 27 @entity113 to hurl throwing sticks as far as they could , measuring the speed with radar guns and the distance			1
they compared their throwing ability to the dimensions of their collarbones and the humerous bone			1
the researchers found that the @entity124 were able to throw at speeds of up to 80mph ( 128km/h ) - comparable to skilled athletes			1
they were able to hurl their sticks more than 328ft ( 100 metres ) in many cases , with none throwing less than 196ft ( 60 metres )			1
the world record for throwing the javelin , for example , is 321ft ( 98 metres ) for men			2
the study showed that differences in collar bone size did not alter the length or speed of the throw			2
by comparing the results to fossils of @entity11 , they conclude that this species of early human would have had similar throwing abilities			1
homo erectus , shown in the reconstruction on the left and the skull on the right , is an extinct ancestor of modern humans that may have shared may of our abilities to throw and hunt , according to the latest research it suggests that the ability to throw spears and other objects for hunting evolved long before our own species , @entity77 , appeared on the planet			1
the ability to throw powerfully and accurately has long been thought of as being a uniquely human trait			2
chimpanzees , by comparison can only throw at speeds of around 20mph			0
the study builds on earlier work by @entity174 that compared the throwing action of college baseball players with the skeletons of chimpanzees			2
they identified key change to the shoulder , arm and torso of humans that allowed them to store elastic energy in their ligaments and tendons to help power a throw forward with great accuracy			2
@entity11 could have been able to throw further than many modern athletes , according to the research tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution , scientists say			1
the high - quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children , meaning that human communities grew faster , according to researchers from @entity205 in @entity206			0
the research compared 67 species of mammals , including humans , apes , mice and killer whales , and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning			1
they found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage , but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores			0
eating meat enabled the breast - feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened , according tot he researchers			0
among natural fertility societies , the average duration of breast - feeding is 2 years and 4 months			0
this is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species , around 120 years			0
it is even less if compared to our closest relatives : female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years , whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years			0
this was a crucial step towards evolving how to throw and led our ancestors to be able to hunt large prey			0
however , archaeological evidence of weapons like spears have yet to be found			0
dr @entity31 said : ' a number of changes occurred in our evolutionary past to the shoulder , arm and torso make this elastic energy storage possible			0
' they first occurred two million years ago in the species homo erectus			0
that allowed us to throw with incredible velocity at around that time			0
' we see hunting behaviour to emerge around that time			0
we think that throwing was important early on in terms of hunting behavoiur to allow our ancestors to kill big game and get more calories in their diet			0

scientists compared the shoulders of @entity11 with modern humans
the researchers from the @entity32 measured the throwing ability of people from the @entity101 tribe in @entity103 and @entity104
*daasanach* people could throw sticks at 80mph over more than 100 metres
the scientists found that @entity11 would have had similar abilities
@entity11 could have *rivalled* modern athletes in their throwing ability
