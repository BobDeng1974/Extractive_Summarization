by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 12 march 2013 it used to be straight to bed without supper for boys and girls who misbehaved			0
but with many children now firmly attached to their electronic gadgets , parents are opting to punish them by confiscating their @entity9 , smartphones and portable games consoles instead			2
the only problem is that more than half said their offspring have thrown a tantrum – which some refer to as ‘ an @entity17 ’ – after their devices are taken away from them			0
the @entity20 : researchers say eight out of 10 parents of children aged 14 or under now restrict their childrens use of gadgets as their preferred method of punishment			1
a quarter of @entity32 households now own tablet computers and children are becoming increasingly attached to the devices			1
in a survey of 2,000 parents , eight out of ten who had children aged 14 or under said they now restrict their use of gadgets as their preferred method of punishment			1
the research found that on average , children spend nearly two hours a day on their favourite gadgets , while more than a quarter spend more than four hours a day staring at a screen			1
confiscating their digital device was reckoned the most effective form of punishment by parents as it stopped their children being able to communicate with their friends			1
@entity53 , of online retailer @entity54 , which commissioned the survey , said : ‘ gadgets such as tablets and smartphones provide both a method of communication and a form of entertainment , so when parents remove them , this becomes a double whammy			2
’ the research also found that more than one in ten children under the age of four regularly used a tablet computer			2
the research found on average , children spend nearly two hours a day on their favourite gadgets although half of parents admitted to buying their children digital devices , more than 70 per cent were concerned their offspring had grown too attached to them			1
more than half of parents said they had banned their children from playing with them , or removed them for a period of time			2
the most popular gadget bought for children was a games console such as an @entity87 or @entity88 , owned by 46 per cent of youngsters , followed by mp3 music players and smartphones , which 30 per cent possess			0
however not only are many children spending increasing amounts of time on their gadgets , they are also running up huge bills for their unsuspecting parents			0
last month , it emerged a five - year - old had run up a bill of £ 1,700 in charges on a so - called ‘ free ’ @entity9 game			0
luckily his parents managed to persuade @entity106 that it was a mistake and got their money back			0
however customers who accidentally rack up large bills on @entity111 do not have an automatic right to a refund .			0
