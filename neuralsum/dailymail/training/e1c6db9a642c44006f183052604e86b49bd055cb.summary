animosity : @entity0 during ' @entity1 : @entity2 - january 8 , 1980 at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity4 she has been dubbed the @entity1 's ' evil stepmother ' - the lady who waited until after his tragically young death to claim he not only had a gay affair but also engaged in an incestuous relationship with his beloved mother			1
dead at the age of 88 at her home in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity21 ' @entity20 was the second wife of @entity1 's dad @entity23 , but as far as his hundreds of millions of fans are concerned she was no better than a gold - digger intent on ruining his stellar legacy			1
as for @entity1 himself , his dislike bordered on open hate , succinctly summed up by his wife @entity31 , who claimed the @entity32 ' could n't stand her '			1
it was only after he was found dead on his bathroom floor at his @entity36 mansion @entity37 in august 1977 that @entity20 began to spout her claims about @entity1 's private life and drug abuse			1
in many televised appearances and in two much - maligned books , @entity20 made numerous allegations including the unsubstantiated claim that @entity1 in fact killed himself after discovering he had untreatable bone - marrow cancer			1
she also said that @entity1 's marriage to @entity31 in 1967 , already controversial for their age difference and speculation about when they first went to bed , was forced upon the singer			1

she repeated this on national television and said she was told this by the family ’s long - serving maid and @entity1 's grandmother @entity79			1
' @entity1 's dislike of @entity20 bordered on hate ...			1
his wife @entity31 said that ' he could n't stand her ' and if the claim that @entity1 , the biggest star rock and roll has ever known , slept with his mother was n't enough , @entity20 's book made the allegation that he had an affair with @entity88 , an @entity89 nominated actor and star of @entity93 's iconic series ' @entity94 ' , who died of a prescription drug overdose in 1968			1
however , many believed @entity20 's claims were motivated by petty jealously and vengeance aimed at @entity1 for ruining her marriage to @entity23 , which ended in november 1977 , three months after @entity1 's untimely death and 18 months before @entity23 himself passed away			1

he is ultimately what caused the deterioration of my marriage			0
he was incredibly selfish ... like a black hole that totally sucks in everything around it			0
' looking the total opposite of dark haired and dark eyed @entity131 , @entity20 , who died on september 28th , first saw @entity1 as he played a show in @entity133 , @entity134 , in 1955			1
it was the year before he rocketed into celebrity orbit with hits such as @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
however it was another three years later in @entity142 , @entity143 , where they first met as @entity1 was serving with @entity20 's then husband , sgt. @entity146 , in the @entity107			2
@entity1 's father had joined his son in @entity143 after the death in august 1958 of @entity73 - which many say the @entity32 never truly got over or recovered from			1
devotion : the graves of @entity1 ( 2 - l ) , his @entity79 ( @entity153 ) , father @entity23 ( 2 - r ) and mother @entity73 ( r ) surrounded with memorial tributes from fans at @entity37 , @entity1 's home in @entity36 , @entity107 @entity20 set up a coffee date with the two to express her condolences , but when she arrived she discovered that @entity1 had failed to show and left his father to meet the pretty blonde according to the @entity161 of the @entity162			1
indeed , it has been speculated that @entity20 in fact had set her sights onto @entity1 , but he apparently at age 24 was not interested in a 29 - year - old woman , ' he is ultimately what caused the deterioration of my marriage			2
he was incredibly selfish ... like a black hole that totally sucks in everything around it			0
@entity175 on her stepson @entity1 however , to @entity1 's horror a romance blossomed between 52 - year - old @entity23 and @entity20 and in april 1960 @entity20 divorced her husband and settled down with @entity20			1
this caused @entity1 to fly into a rage at the thought that his father could even contemplate marrying again so soon after the death of his mother			2
long recognized as the most important woman in @entity1 's life , outstripping the impact of @entity31 whom he famously dedicated his hit ' @entity190 ' to , @entity73 ' death devastated the singer			1
in fact , next to his grave at @entity37 is where @entity73 is also buried , a site of pilgramage for the millions who descend on the @entity36 mansion every year			0
doting on his mother , @entity1 bought @entity73 a pink cadillac when he became a global sensation , but she was prone to depression and her worries caused her to turn to drink			2
loggerheads : @entity1 in 1957 - every inch the icon ( left ) and @entity205 who died on september 28th at her home in @entity18 , @entity19 after releasing two controversial books on her stepson her excessive consumption of alcohol led her to develop liver damage and ultimately the hepatitis that killed her			1

' she ’s all we lived for , she was always my best girl , ' said @entity1 according to the @entity161			0
at her funeral the @entity32 threw himself over her body , screaming for her to come back to him and as she lay in the coffin he touchingly brushed her hair with his hands			0
' he could n’t stop touching her , kissing her , and whispering to her ... ‘ just look at @entity224 , look at those hands of @entity226 , those hands toiled to raise me ’			0
he carried around her nightgown , clutching it tightly even when he slept			0
' those family members who knew @entity1 well said that after her death , ' he never seemed like @entity1 again			2
' bloated : @entity103 rock singer @entity1 , wearing his iconic white rhinestone - studded suit performing in 1975 once he returned from the @entity107 to begin his questionable film career , @entity1 's relationship with @entity20 was best described as chilly			1
however , he did eventually offer her three sons jobs in his entourage known as the ' @entity237 ' and bought her and his father a home on @entity240 in an upmarket area of @entity36			0
these three boys became so engrained and trusted by @entity1 that they became known as his ' @entity243			0
' however , no doubt the @entity237 was tight , but according to other friends the group could possibly share some of the blame for @entity1 's descent in drugs as they could never say no to him			2
one of @entity20 's sons , @entity250 , wrote after @entity1 's death , ' i have never seen a human being in my life abuse drugs like @entity1			1
' i am not talking about street drugs , i am talking about prescribed drugs			0
some of the doctors were out for the almighty buck			0
' some have claimed that one of the reasons for @entity20 's animosity towards @entity1 later in her life was because he welcomed everyone of her family into his - apart from her			1
her 1980 book , ' @entity1 : @entity267 ' , is described as ' the story of a wife and mother , her sons and how it felt to have the major portion of our lives consumed by @entity1 's own life			1

' i could n't hate him for causing me tragedy , ' she said to the @entity122			0
' for taking my husband and my sons away ...			0
@entity1 was really just as victimized as we were			0
' defending her right to pen her own account of her time with @entity1 , she justified it as taking back what had been lost to her			0
