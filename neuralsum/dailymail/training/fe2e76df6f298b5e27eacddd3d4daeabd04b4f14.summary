official government sources confirmed to @entity16 that @entity0 soldiers flew to a secret base in the @entity2 last week			1
travelling in groups of three and four , the crack troops boarded commercial flights dressed in civilian clothes			0
they mingled with unsuspecting businessmen and tourists to maintain operational security			0
after weeks of intense preparation at the regiment ’s barracks in @entity31 , the elite soldiers are now waiting for the order to strike @entity34 targets			0
it is understood that part of the @entity0 mission could also include an attempt to rescue the remaining hostages , including @entity6 photographer @entity40			1
the @entity16 has been made aware of more detailed information about the mission but has agreed with @entity44 officials not to publish it for security reasons			0
however , we can reveal that the soldiers are sharing a remote desert location with @entity6 intelligence agents and communications experts who are understood to be tracking @entity3 ’s movements and also intercepting is radio and telephone messages			1
final approval for any @entity0 mission inside @entity56 – where it is believed the hostages are being held – would have to be granted by the prime minister			1
@entity60 told @entity61 in september that he would seize any opportunity to launch a rescue attempt			1
last night , an @entity0 source described to this newspaper how , to respect political sensitivities in the region , @entity6 troops were keeping a low profile			1
he said : ‘ the guys have left @entity31 to carry out a strike raid on @entity72			0
they flew out there on commercial flights so that sorties by @entity6 military aircraft can be kept to a minimum			2
‘ this is at the request of pro- @entity80 leaders in the @entity2 who are concerned about appearing to support the @entity6 in the war against @entity72			1
‘ all the kit is ready and waiting for the guys and they ’re on very short notice to strike @entity72			0
‘ it is more personal for the guys because @entity3 is @entity6 and he ’s killing @entity6 hostages			1
but now he ’s basically a dead man walking			0
’ in september the @entity16 published photos of @entity6 forces rehearsing surprise airborne assaults , which could be used by the @entity0 to rescue hostages at the desert base , which is within striking distance of @entity72 targets in @entity56 , the @entity0 troops are now carrying out final rehearsals for a raid and are using the most sophisticated weapons available to the @entity100			1
in addition to this arsenal , the @entity0 troopers are backed up by teams from 264 ( @entity0 ) @entity105 who are equipped with mobile satellites			2
using this equipment , the latest information about the whereabouts of @entity3 and the remaining hostages in is captivity is relayed to and from the frontline and back to @entity0 operational headquarters in @entity6			1
the @entity0 troops are also supported by a 17 - man crew aboard a @entity6 spy plane called ‘ @entity118 ’			1
the crew ’s job is to record conversations between jihadis as the aircraft circles thousands of feet above the battlefield			0
these intercepts are fed to translators working with the @entity0 and are sent back to @entity127 , the government ’s secret communications headquarters			1
the messages between terrorists are matched against records of @entity6 jihadis believed to be fighting in @entity56			2
crack unit : the @entity0 troops have undergone intense training for the mission and have now flew to a secret base in the @entity2 the @entity0 is also rehearsing raids using video footage provided by @entity140 ( @entity140 ) , or drones			1
these aircraft , which can fly for up to 24 hours and can climb to an altitude of 18,000ft , fly over @entity72 strongholds and provide up - to - the - second pictures of the enemy ’s hideouts			0
this live information will play a vital role in any @entity6 @entity13 operation to strike @entity3 and rescue the hostages			1
while he seems to speak with a distinctive @entity155 accent , it remains unclear just how much is known about @entity3			2
in september @entity157 director @entity156 announced that the agency had established his real identity			0
however , no more information has been released			0
since his reign of terror began in august , @entity3 has murdered four hostages – @entity164 @entity163 , 40 , and @entity165 , 31 , and @entity6 @entity11 , 44 , and @entity9 , 47			1
@entity3 has already killed @entity6 hostages @entity9 , left , and @entity11 , right all of the executions were filmed and the videos were subsequently released on the internet			1
in the video showing the beheading of mr @entity11 , @entity3 challenged the prime minister , saying : ‘ if you , @entity60 , insist on fighting the @entity34 then you , like your master @entity174 , will have the blood of your people on your hands			2
’ the prime minister subsequently made it clear that he would not necessarily wait for @entity180 ’ approval before giving the order to the @entity13 troops to take their hunt for @entity3 into @entity56			2
he said : ‘ in order to catch @entity3 , you have to know where he is , right ? we know he is in @entity56			0
‘ i very clearly reserve the position that if you need to act immediately , either to secure a vital @entity6 interest or to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe , you would act first and go to then the @entity192 afterwards			0
’ it is believed that there has been only one attempt by international troops to target @entity3			2
following mr @entity163 ’s death , it emerged that @entity199 had previously launched a failed raid on an @entity72 stronghold where it was thought the terrorist was holding him			0
it is understood that part of the @entity0 mission could also include an attempt to rescue the remaining hostages , including @entity6 photographer @entity40 , pictured however , when the troops from the elite @entity213 unit arrived , the @entity72 commanders and their captives had already fled			1
the town of @entity215 is @entity72 ’s strongest base in northern @entity56			0
it is considered likely that the terrorists would choose this town to hold its remaining hostages and for @entity3 to hide out there			2
@entity0 sources told @entity16 of the planned mission as @entity164 - led air strikes targeted a gathering of @entity72 leaders in @entity225 yesterday			2
