for three years he forced women into a penniless life of sexual slavery and servitude			0
' he would beat these women if they did not obey him , controlling them physically and psychologically to the point where they felt powerless to free themselves from his violent grip			0
' it is that power , that control , that makes it possible for young women to be trafficked into the @entity2 and prostituted against their will			0
' one incident really sticks in my mind			0
at one point , @entity0 told the girls he would report them to police for working as a prostitute if they did not obey him			1

pictured is @entity145 in @entity70 , where his son @entity146 ran one of the brothels ' i ca n't begin to imagine what a nightmare existence they lived through , virtually destitute , repeatedly beaten and living day - to - day in fear			2
' however , eventually one of the girls had the courage to speak up and as a result , police in @entity22 , assisted by numerous agencies across @entity158 , have exposed this family for who they really are			2
' i would like to personally commend her for her bravery after years of living in fear			0
her bravery can not be overstated			0

' those involved in human trafficking often use multiple locations to avoid detection , but thanks to the dedication and sheer tenacity of the officers involved , this family has been brought to justice			1
' i want to assure people living in @entity22 , and the wider communities of @entity21 , that there is nothing we wo n't do to bring human traffickers to justice			0
' there is no stone we wo n't overturn and no country we wo n't go to expose these people for who they are : shameless cowards who profit by selling women into sex against their will			0
