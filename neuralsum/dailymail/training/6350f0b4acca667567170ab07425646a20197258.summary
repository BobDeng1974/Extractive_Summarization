@entity0 may have bought @entity1 , but now @entity2 is reportedly splashing out virtual reality technology too			1
the search giant is set to invest $ 500 million ( £ 314 million ) in @entity5 , which claims to have invented be a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , dubbed ‘ cinematic reality ’			1
the @entity11 - based firm ’s website features a little elephant moving around realistically in a person ’s hands , to show off their capabilities			1
the @entity11 - based firm ’s website features a little elephant ( pictured ) moving around realistically in a person ’s hands , to show what it can do gamers hope that @entity0 and @entity2 ’s involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology , which would make playing games and watching films more realistic , as well as creating other immersive experiences			1
@entity2 is tipped to be joined by other large investors such as @entity32 in the secretive fundraising round , re / code reported , citing anonymous sources			0
the company has already raised $ 50 million ( £ 31 million ) in funding earlier this year , but rumours of the new tranche of funding have not been confirmed by any of the parties involved			2
@entity41 , @entity5 ’s ceo , said his firm is working on ‘ the most natural and human - friendly wearable computing interface in the world			2
’ @entity5 's system claims to be more realistic than the @entity1 ( pictured )			1
the firm was acquired earlier this year by @entity0 for $ 2 billion , and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the virtual reality headset to be launched an expert has claimed that ultra-realistic games played using virtual reality headsets could kill people			1
@entity54 believes that the technology is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death , is not far away			0
mr @entity54 , creative director at @entity60 warned a virtual reality panel in @entity62 that ‘ we ’re very close to having the first death in @entity64 ’ , @entity59 reported			2
he said : ‘ when the commercial version comes out , somebody is going to scare somebody to death - somebody with a heart condition or something like that			0
it is going to happen			0
’ many realistic video games played on standard consoles make players feel tense and villains often jump out and ' attack ' gamers			0
but this effect could be intensified hugely when virtual reality headsets become widely available			2
very few details about the technology have been revealed , aside from saying it offers a more realistic experience than @entity1			2
mr @entity41 told the @entity85 that virtual reality and augmented reality are old terms , with a largely disappointing history			1
‘ we have the term “ cinematic reality ” because we are disassociated with those things			2
… when you see this , you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years			0
‘ to go farther and deeper than we ’re going , you would be changing what it means to be human			0
’ it is likely that the device will show wearers hi - resolution images close to their face , by projecting pictures onto the eye			1
viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus			0
this would be beneficial because @entity5 could mix virtual reality images with the real world			1
while it is not clear what form the technology takes , mr @entity41 has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses , in which case , @entity2 may aim on incorporating ‘ cinematic reality ’ into future iterations of @entity122			2

an image showing the burring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the company is pictured the smart spectacles already enable users to access augmented reality elements			1
using a particular app for example , runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them			0
the glasses also superimpose information on the periphery of a wearer ’s vision			0
@entity0 spent $ 2 billion buying @entity149 earlier this year , which makes a virtual reality headset , mostly aimed at gamers			1
unlike @entity5 ’s future device , it blocks out the real world around the user			1
while it is not clear what form the technology takes , mr @entity41 has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses , in which case , @entity2 may aim on incorporating ‘ cinematic reality ’ into future iterations of @entity122 ( pictured ) last month , @entity149 unveiled its @entity164 model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor , and now features 360 - degree tracking			1
reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $ 200 ( £ 122 ) the 360 - degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer 's head movements , which in turn will make games more immersive and true - to - life			2
elsewhere , the headset has a higher resolution , per eye , than the current second - generation development kit – @entity182 - and these displays are powered by @entity185 devices			0
a teardown of the @entity182 revealed that the headset uses @entity189 displays , and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship @entity193			0
by comparison , the @entity182 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye , and the note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution			0
aside from these specifications , @entity64 is yet to release the rest of @entity164 ’s features , or a price tag for the gadget .			0
