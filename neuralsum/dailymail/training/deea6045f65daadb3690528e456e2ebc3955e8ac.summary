@entity0 and @entity1 have been accused of allowing @entity2 to flourish by refusing to remove hundreds of inflammatory posts which have been reported by anti-racism campaigners			1
some of the posts which have been flagged up to the two social media sites include accusations of @entity9 being rapists , paedophiles and comparable to cancer			1
in one shocking example , a @entity0 user , who was referring to the beheading of @entity14 in @entity15 said : ' for every person beheaded by these sick savages we should drag 10 off the streets and behead them , film it and put it online			0
@entity0 has been accused of allowing @entity2 to flourish by refusing to take down hundreds of inflammatory posts from their sites			1
pictured : ceo @entity26 speaking in @entity27 in 2013 ' for every child they cut in half â€¦ we cut one of their children in half			0
' but , in several cases , the accounts behind the abusive messages have not been suspended , nor have the posts been removed , according to a report by @entity42			1
@entity0 said it had to ' strike the right balance ' between freedom of expression and maintaining ' a safe and trusted environment ' , while @entity1 maintained that all reports against the site 's rules were investigated			1
the investigation also found that the volume of posts have increased significantly in the wake of the @entity55 sex abuse scandal and the beheading of @entity58 hostages by @entity60 fanatics			0
over the past four months , @entity62 groups have been compiling details of online abuse and reporting it to @entity1 and @entity0			2
they have reportedly brought hundreds of messages to the attention of the social - media companies , but the accounts are still easily accessible			2
one prolific tweeter , who has been reported several times , wrote on @entity73 : ' should have lost @entity74			0
your daughters would be getting impregnated by handsome blond @entity77 instead of @entity80 goat herders			0
' one man , @entity82 , who was branded a ' vile , reprehensible bigot ' after he sent offensive photographs and social media posts to an @entity62 community centre near @entity87 , was given a suspended sentence for his crime			2
@entity1 said it investigates all abuse reported against its rules , but anti-racism groups say they have found several tweets which are inflammatory and have not been taken down but his @entity0 account , which he used to send abusive messages to the same mosque and is still using to convey his message , is still active			1
@entity98 , director of @entity99 , an interfaith organisation which runs a helpline called tell mama , for victims of @entity105 violence , said he was disappointed the sites were not taking a stronger stance			1
he said : ' it is morally unacceptable that social media platforms like @entity0 and @entity1 , which are vast profit - making companies , socially engineer what is right and wrong to say in our society when they leave up inflammatory , highly socially divisive and openly bigoted views			1
' mr @entity98 said that tell @entity102 regularly receives reports of @entity105 rhetoric and hate from concerned @entity0 and @entity1 users			2
in october , the @entity121 also released figures to show hate crime against @entity9 in @entity124 had risen by 65 per cent over the previous 12 months			0
latest figures also suggest that @entity105 hate crime has risen sharply following the murder of @entity128 in 2013			0
in a statement @entity0 said it had a clear policy for deciding what was and what was not acceptable freedom of speech			2
' we take hate speech seriously and remove any content reported to us that directly attacks others based on their race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sex , gender , sexual orientation , disability or medical condition			0
the volume of posts have increased significantly in the past few months , in the aftermath of the @entity55 sex abuse scandal and the murder of @entity58 hostages held by @entity60			0
pictured : the @entity60 flag ' with a diverse global community of more than a billion people , we occasionally see people post content which , whilst not against our rules , some people may find offensive			0
' by working with community groups like @entity99 , we aim to show people the power of counter speech and , in doing so , strike the right balance between giving people the freedom to express themselves and maintaining a safe and trusted environment			1
