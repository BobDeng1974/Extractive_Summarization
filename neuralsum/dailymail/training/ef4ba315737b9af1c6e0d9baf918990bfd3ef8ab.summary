by @entity0 we 're regularly encouraged to pay close attention to the environmental cost of our holidays , but now there 's a cruise to take a tour of the devastation that mankind has allegedly caused			1
tourists can now take a trip through the melted @entity12 to see the sights of the @entity14 , while it still exists as we know it			1
the luxurious month - long grand tour will give climate - curious tourists the chance to see endangered @entity14 animals such as polar bears in their quickly disappearing natural habitat			1
the ultimate journey ? departing from the @entity25 , ( mapped ) the 31 - day journey will navigate the @entity12 , around @entity26 and into the @entity27 , through the @entity28 and on to @entity29 , before ending in @entity30 sail date : august 16 , 2016 – for 32 days ship : holds 1,070 passengers plus crew , weighs 68,000 tonnes and is 13 decks tall			1
itinerary : flexible with ‘ expedition days ’ finalised 14 hours in advance to coincide with favourable weather conditions			0
possible adventures : helicopter , @entity43 and kayaking trips plus @entity45 treks with guides			1
experts : 14 naturalists , explorers , scientists , historians and photographers on board			0
extra lectures and photography workshops will be available and a local @entity14 guide will give an insight into the @entity59 community			1
wildlife : seals and walruses will be seen throughout the trip			0
in @entity65 , @entity64 might encounter humpback whales and @entity67 and bowhead whales are possible			0
musk - ox might be seen on shore , either in @entity71 or @entity29 , and the @entity12 boasts teaming colonies of kittiwakes , guillemots and murres			0
the company said : ‘ in general , wildlife along the @entity12 is unpredictable and often difficult to spot … while polar bears thrive in this region , there is no guarantee that any will be seen on the transit or that the ship will be able to approach within a few miles			2
’ temperature : highs of 9 ° c ( @entity86 ) during the day and lows of – 2 ° c ( @entity88 ) at sea			0
environmental impact : not currently known			2
conservationists claim that warmer temperatures are threatening the animals ’ existence and the cruise is designed to give wildlife enthusiasts the chance to see a plethora of creatures unique to the @entity14 , while they still can , tapping into what some might say is a form of ' disaster tourism '			1
there is no mention of the environmental impact of the journey itself , however , with some experts estimating that cruise trips are far more damaging than journeys taken by aeroplane			1
the ‘ once - in - a - lifetime expeditionary voyage ’ is being offered by @entity111 from almost £ 14,000 ( $ 24,000 ) and is set to appeal to wildlife lovers and those curious about our changing world			1
the luxurious @entity64 cruise ship will be the first to traverse the @entity12 , ‘ a mystical @entity120 - @entity119 sea route far beyond the @entity121 that for centuries captured the imaginations of kings , explorers and adventurers , ’ the firm says			1
it is only in recent years that the passage has become passable in the summer , because of melting ice			2
until 2009 , the @entity14 pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year , but climate change has reduced the pack ice and made the waterways more navigable			0
departing from the @entity25 , the 32 - day journey will navigate the @entity12 , around @entity26 and into the @entity27 , through the @entity28 and on to @entity29 , before docking in @entity30			1
‘ the company says : ‘ here in the @entity138 , you will bear witness to breath - taking landscapes that few have ever seen , from spectacular glaciers to towering fjords , and experience nature that is truly wild			0
’ the trip is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on august 16 , 2016			1
in the lap of luxury : the luxurious @entity64 cruise ship ( pictured ) will be the first to traverse the @entity12 , ' a mystical @entity120 - @entity119 sea route far beyond the @entity121 that for centuries captured the imaginations of kings , explorers and adventurers , ' the firm says see them while you can : tourists will be taken on ‘ unplanned expedition days ’ to take in wildlife such as of polar bears ( stock image pictured left ) , narwhals , ( right ) musk oxen and @entity165			1
but the company warns that endangered animals such as the polar bear may prove elusive the company has been planning the cruise for over two years			2
it chose the august - september sail date because it says it is the optimum time of year to navigate the @entity12			2
‘ this is when the @entity14 ice significantly recedes allowing vessels to safely transit with minimal risk of encountering ice concentrations , ’ the company says			1
‘ and here in a land where the sun rarely sets , you have more time to absorb every last detail of this extraordinary journey			0
’ tourists will be taken on ‘ unplanned expedition days ’ to take in wildlife such as of polar bears , narwhals , musk oxen and @entity165			0
they could also go kayaking in protected bays and trekking in the tundra with professional guides and scientists as well as taking a tour of the environment in small @entity199 – rubber motorised boats			0
an escort vessel will follow the cruise ship packed with ‘ adventure equipment ’ including a platform for wilderness landings and a helicopter			1
the crew will be accompanied by a 14 naturalists , explorers , scientists , historians and photographers to point out and document the sights			0
‘ once - in - a - lifetime experiences include the chance to see rare wildlife in its purest form - from humpback , beluga and bowhead whales , to seals and walruses , musk - oxen on shore and teaming colonies of kittiwakes , guillemots and murres in flight , ’ according to the brochure			1
holidaymakers will also have the chance to meet indigenous people in small groups , which the firm says is designed to benefit and not disrupt the locals and their way of life			0
the cruise claims to balance ‘ rare adventure with intimate exploration , ’ but there is no mention of its carbon footprint , which may seem unusual seeing as the itinerary is designed to appeal to people who love the great outdoors and are interested in the rapidly changing landscape			1
@entity111 has not disclosed figures showing the cruise ’s environmental impact on its icy surroundings			1
but estimates made in 2013 , indicate that the carbon footprint of a cruise ship can be three times as large as a flight , if measured per customer , @entity254 reported			2
a spokesman for the company told @entity263 : ' @entity111 will , as it always has , meet or exceed all environmental regulatory requirements for the regions in which our ships sail with respect to air , water and garbage discharge			2
' for the @entity12 transit this includes the voluntary use of 0.1per cent sulfur content @entity275 which is extremely clean burning and is well in excess of the existing environmental regulations			2
this , along with a relatively slow transit speed and using one third of our engines for a vast majority of the cruise , will achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint			0
' getting less icy : the trip is two years is two years in the making and the first cruise will depart on august 16 , 2016			1
this satellite image of the @entity12 shows the ice retreating in august 2012 in 2008 , cruise company @entity295 said that on average , its ships released 712kg of carbon dioxide per kilometre			1
taking into consideration the number of passengers they carried , experts worked out that a journey was 36 times as damaging as a @entity305 trip when it came to carbon emissions , although unlike the @entity305 , people were living on board for a period of time			0
as well as damaging emissions , the @entity314 's magazine , @entity315 , estimated that the average cruise ship generates 7.7lbs ( 3.5kg ) of rubbish per holiday maker , every day , @entity311 reported			1
some of the ships also emit sewage and bilge water , with one cruise ship estimated to produce 19 tonnes of solid waste daily , according to @entity324			2
as the ships are designed like small floating cities , they are more than a mode of transport and can not be directly compared to flights , but like cities consume large amounts of power			0
in a book entitled @entity335 : @entity336 , expert @entity337 claims that some ships have a carbon footprint that is three times as large as a @entity341 , if averaged out by the number of passengers on board			0
figures from a carbon offsetting business , @entity346 , suggest that the ships emit twice as much carbon dioxide per mile as aeroplanes and can also belch out sulphur - which causes acid rain - if barrel bunker fuel is used , which is less refined than diesel			0
amazing scenery : holidaymakers could go kayaking in protected bays and trekking in the tundra with professional guides and scientists who will help them understand the various animals and landscapes of the @entity12 ( pictured ) air pollution from ships can equivalent to 12,000 cars and one estimate places it as high as 350,000 cars , resource @entity366 reports			2
a spokesman for the cruise company said : ' @entity64 has a well - trained and environmentally - conscious crew , and we will operate , as we always do , with a “ nothing overboard ” policy			0
no garbage or food waste of any kind will be thrown overboard			0
' some garbage will be burned in the incinerator on board , while other trash , recycling and food waste will be collected and stored on board the escort vessel			0
this waste will then be offloaded outside of the @entity14 communities into specific collection facilities that are equipped to handle these waste streams			0
' @entity391 , polar programme manager at @entity392 , old @entity263 : ' the loss of @entity14 summer sea ice is perhaps the most visible sign of climate change on our planet			2
' with new international shipping routes such as the @entity12 opening up as a result of less sea ice , the risk of major shipping accidents and trans - boundary oil spills increases			1
' these would have massive long - term impacts for @entity14 communities and wildlife , including polar bears and beluga whales			2
it is increasingly urgent that the @entity413 in @entity414 agrees a robust @entity415 for safe and environmentally responsible shipping in the region			0

luxurious month - long grand tour will give tourists the chance to see endangered @entity14 animals and threatened icy landscape
trip is set to appeal to lovers of the great outdoors but there is no mention of the cruise 's environmental impact in the brochure
' once - in - a - lifetime expeditionary voyage ’ is being offered by @entity111 from almost £ 14,000 ( £ 24,000 )
ship will embark from the @entity25 on august 16 , 2016
company claims its cruise ship will be the first to traverse the @entity12 - a sea route that 's becoming more *accessible* *due* to melting ice
