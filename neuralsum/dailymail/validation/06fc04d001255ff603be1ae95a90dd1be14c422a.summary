by the time @entity0 traipsed in , ninth in the first race of his last @entity3 , the acclaim for his great friend and rival was ringing in his ears			1
the sound of rolling thunder from the crowd , packed 50 - deep on @entity11 along the final two furlongs of the closing straight , concluded with @entity13 ’s name being chanted			2
suddenly the people ’s hero seemed quite incidental			0
it was not to get a great deal better for the man who transcends national hunt racing , and whose farewell to its biggest meeting dominated the build - up to this event			0
@entity0 rides @entity24 to a disappointing fourth in the @entity26 on day one of @entity3 in truth , @entity0 has known plenty of days like this at @entity3 before , and while he will have felt disappointment , his supporters in a record opening - day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them			1
the thought of this @entity3 helps sustain some people through the long winter months and , when it finally arrived , it could hardly have been more glorious			1
@entity37 almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front			0
amid the drama @entity0 fought hard to try to fulfil the expectations placed upon him , perhaps more from a wider sporting public who have come to revere his sustained excellence			2
the cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at @entity3 this year , but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance			2
the fantasy ending remains victory on friday , either in the @entity54 or the meeting ’s final race , which has been temporarily renamed in his honour			2
he might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles , but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room			0
@entity0 had considered @entity24 ( above ) as his best chance of a winner at @entity3 this year you do not become the nation ’s most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting			1
on tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth , last , fifth , fourth and pulling up in his five races			1
it is a strange day when @entity79 @entity78 , uber - wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership , gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure , but this was one of them			0
@entity0 has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement , but afternoons such as on tuesday might serve to ease the fear			1
no defeat hurt more than coming fourth on @entity24 in the @entity26 , and the horse ’s trainer @entity93 revealed he had been quick to take responsibility			1
@entity0 looks dejected after the final race , the @entity97 ’ @entity98 ‘ @entity100 was blaming himself , saying he took on @entity102 at the top of the hill , and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth , ’ she said			1
‘ if he had ridden him to be second to @entity102 then he may well have been second			0
’ the latter scenario was never likely to happen , especially as @entity0 had identified @entity24 , the defending champion from last year , as probably his best chance in 2015			1
he was not to add to his comparatively modest @entity3 tally of 30 winners , a total exceeded not just by @entity13 but @entity113 , too			2
he has tasted glory here — the @entity54 win on @entity117 and the masterclass on @entity119 in the 2009 @entity120 — but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this @entity123 jamboree			0
@entity0 , riding @entity124 , pulled up with two fences left in the final race of the day @entity0 , riding in his last @entity3 , did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race , the exotically - named @entity97 ’ @entity98 , on @entity124			1
they were never in it and pulled up with two fences left			0
afterwards @entity0 had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner @entity135 before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time			2
he was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon ’s events , saying only ‘ it was all right			0
’ perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase			0
for @entity100 it had been a @entity147 kind of day .			0

the 2015 @entity3 got under way on tuesday
@entity0 rode in five races but could only manage a best place fourth
@entity0 rode @entity24 to a disappointing fourth in the @entity26
this is @entity0 *'s* final @entity3 before retirement
