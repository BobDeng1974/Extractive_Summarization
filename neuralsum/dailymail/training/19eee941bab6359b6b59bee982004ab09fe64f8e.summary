ruling : a @entity1 woman has been allowed to enter a plea without removing her full - face veil a @entity1 woman has been allowed to appear in court as a defendant and enter a plea without removing her full - face veil			1
the woman , who denied a charge of witness intimidation , had previously been told by judge @entity13 that she would have to show her face to enter a plea so she could be conclusively identified			1
the same judge today backed down and allowed her to enter the dock to plead not guilty while wearing a niqab at @entity19			1
judge @entity13 will give directions on monday as to whether the woman can stand trial while wearing a veil that shows only her eyes			1
the woman , from east @entity27 , who can not be identified for legal reason , had argued that she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons			1
but compromise was met today when a female police officer , who saw her face when she was photographed after her arrest , had a private viewing with her in a room at the court			1
the officer then swore on oath that it was the same woman			2
judge @entity13 said : ' i would be satisfied for the officer giving evidence , having seen the defendant backstage so to speak in a private setting , saying she could identify her			1
' the defendant 's barrister , @entity48 , argued that she had a right to wear the veil during today 's proceedings and her trial in november under @entity54 9 of the @entity55 , which safeguards religious beliefs			1
she also highlighted the ' tolerant ' approach taken to @entity59 dress in the @entity60			2
ms @entity48 said : ' she is entitled to wear it in private and in public			0
' that right to wear the niqab also extends to the courtroom			0
' there is no legislation in the @entity60 in respect of the wearing of the niqab			0
' there is no law in this country banning it			0
' she added that the same rules would apply to witnesses or victims of crime who appeared in court			0
she also pointed out that the defendant 's only active participation in her trial would be giving evidence , if she does so , and suggested the jury would be able to make a judgment based on her answers and body language despite the veil			1
ms @entity48 added : ' ultimately it 's the choice of the defendant if she wishes to wear it			0
' if she chooses to remain with her face veil on when giving evidence that is something she will no doubt be spoken to about by the judge in front of the jury			1
hearing : the woman , who appeared before @entity19 , pictured , was charged with witness intimidation ' to ask her to remove it , if that is the court 's opinion at the end of it , what consequences follow ? a court order and proceedings of contempt ? is that right and fair ? ' the defendant today pleaded not guilty to charges of intimidating a witness in @entity111 , north @entity27 , in june			1
she will appear back at @entity19 on monday at 11am , ahead of her trial due to take place on november 4			1
after the woman had entered her not guilty plea , miss @entity48 and judge @entity13 continued to debate the wearing of the veil for the trial			1
judge @entity13 pondered whether the wearing of a veil could affect the jury ' to a significant degree by them being unable to see her reaction to questions being put '			1
miss @entity48 said : ' whether the jury would find it more difficult is really where the question begins			0
' jurors could look at her body language and eyes to evaluate her character			0
' ' there is always going to be a photo of her			0
' the jury could be shown that			0
' on tuesday , @entity1 students were banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security			0
teenagers at @entity142 were told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are ' easily identifiable at all times '			2
the @entity147 caused controversy back in 2011 around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public			0
politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance			2
the law - which sparked protests in @entity160 - was brought into effect in 2011 under the leadership of former @entity147 president @entity163			2
@entity60 politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha			0
in 2006 , former @entity169 foreign secretary @entity168 sparked outrage when he said he had ask @entity1 women to remove their veils when talking to them in his constituency surgery			2
three years ago @entity174 mp @entity174 tabled a private members ' bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in public			2
