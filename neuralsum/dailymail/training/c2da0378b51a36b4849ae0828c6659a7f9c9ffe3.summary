@entity10 , a school teacher , and his children @entity13 , 13 , and @entity14 , 9 , are the first civilians to give evidence to @entity7 about the alleged strike			1
the children 's grandmother @entity18 , 67 , who was mr @entity10 's mother , died in october 2012			1
@entity20 , nine , eats ice cream as she watches @entity22 , producer and director of the documentary ' unmanned - @entity5 's @entity26 ' lift a picture of her @entity29 grandmother @entity20 , 9 , poses for a picture alongside her brother @entity13 ( left ) and father @entity10 ( right ) and @entity5 representative @entity32 yesterday , a translator was moved to tears when she heard the family 's account			1
in a testimony 13 - year - old @entity13 , told @entity7 : ' my grandmother was nobody ’s enemy			1
' she was kind and caring			2
she used to help the mothers in my village deliver their babies			2
' in the evening , she would tell all of the children to gather around and she would tell us stories			1
@entity47 , who was killed in a @entity5 - led drone strike in north western @entity29 last october stories of her life , of our family , of our community			1
she had so many stories that i ca n’t pick a favourite			2
i miss all of them			2
' the family is being represented by human rights group @entity59 and their legal representative @entity60			2
their @entity63 - based lawyer , @entity62 , a fellow of @entity59 , had intended to join them but was denied a @entity66 by the @entity5 authorities , according to the charity			2
mr @entity10 added : ' in @entity70 we have a saying : " aik lari main pro kay rakhna "			1
literally translated , it means the string that holds the pearls together			0
' that is what my mother was			0
she was the string that held our family together			0
since her death , the string has been broken and life has not been the same			0
' we feel alone and we feel lost			0
' my family no longer gathers together like it did when my mother was alive			0
i hardly see my brothers and sisters and my children rarely see their cousins			1
their cousins tell them that they are afraid to visit because the drone might then kill them , too			0
' an @entity93 report published last week said 900 people have been killed by drone strikes and is calling for the @entity5 to stand trial for its actions			0
however , the @entity5 has always claimed that few civilians have been killed by drones and argues its campaign is ' consistent with all applicable domestic and international law '			2
@entity20 , 9 , holds up a picture she drew depicting the alleged @entity5 drone strike on her @entity29 village nine - year - old @entity20 holds a photo with a drawing she made depicting a drone strike that allegedly killed her grandmother nine - year - old @entity20 pauses during a news conference on @entity110 in @entity111 devastated : @entity20 ( centre ) , 9 , sits between her brother @entity13 ( right ) and father @entity10 ( left ) at the beginning of a news conference on @entity110 in @entity111 nine - year - old @entity20 , from the remote tribal region of @entity117 in @entity29 , during the news conference @entity59 staff attorney @entity60 said : ' the onus is now on president @entity119 and his administration to bring this war out of the shadows and to give answers			1
that is how a democracy works			0
they can not operate in shadows			0
until we do that , every child who loses life or limb persuades dozens more in tribal @entity29 that the @entity5 does not distinguish friend from foe			0
' children who are not hit themselves , like @entity14 and @entity13 , continue to live in terror that the hovering drone may attack them next			1
silence in the face of this only fuels resentment – not just against the @entity5 , but against the government of @entity29 for its complicity in these killings			0
' too often this debate has been a quibble about statistics and not about the human cost – and political consequence – of the drone wars			0
' i hope today ’s testimony offers a much - needed antidote to this			1
