@entity0 affects nearly 2,000 people in the @entity2 each year , many of them children , and results in death for one in 10 sufferers the first vaccine to offer broad protection against meningitis b is to be licensed for use in the @entity2 , drastically reducing the number of children killed by the disease			1
there are 1,870 cases of meningitis b in the @entity2 on average each year , resulting in up to 200 deaths – half of which occur in the under - fives			1
as many as 400 children a year are also left with serious lifelong complications such as limb amputations , blindness , deafness and brain damage			0
although vaccination programmes have been successfully introduced to combat other strains of meningitis , no vaccine against the b strain currently exists in this country			1
@entity34 is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in @entity2 , one of the most deadly , and the one that poses the toughest challenge to develop a vaccine for because there are so many variations to target			1
@entity43 is the first vaccine providing broad protection against 800 deadly meningococcal b strains which , in some cases , can kill within hours			1
the @entity48 , a drug regulatory body which covers the @entity2 , issued a ' positive opinion ' on @entity51 yesterday , which means it is safe and effective			1
this is the first step in an approval process that should result in the jab , developed by @entity56 , being licensed within three months			1
but the critical decision on whether it will become part of the routine @entity60 immunisation programme for babies and children lies with the @entity63 , which advises the government			0
it will consider factors such as price , cost - effectiveness and compatibility with other childhood vaccines			0
the last major vaccine against meningitis – the pneumococcal vaccine – took five years to be introduced into the immunisation schedule			1
@entity75 , founder of the @entity75 charity who lost his baby @entity79 to meningitis and meningococcal septicaemia in 1982 , said : ' this is a landmark moment in the fight against meningitis			2
i have waited three decades to hear this along with many other families who have supported the cause			2
the approval of the new @entity91 vaccine has been hailed as the ' biggest leap forward in the field in the three decades ' ' it is vital that the vaccine is introduced in the @entity2 immunisation schedule as soon as possible			1
' it will save countless lives and prevent many people enduring the suffering caused by this devastating disease			0
we will be campaigning hard to make the government introduce it			0
' @entity105 , of @entity56 , said the company was already in discussions with the government and warned : ' every year of delay in a country like @entity2 costs the lives of dozens more children who do not have to die – a sense of urgency is appropriate			0
' in trials involving 7,500 children , adolescents and adults , the vaccine , which can be used for babies aged two months and older , produced antibodies against 77 per cent of strains			2
@entity124 , chief executive of the @entity126 charity , said : ' we see the devastation that meningitis continues to cause to victims and their families , tearing lives apart in a matter of hours			2
' this vaccine could save many lives every year , but it could also save the long - term suffering that many survivors face after the disease			0
' but she warned that people must not become complacent as , even if @entity43 is introduced , people are still not protected from all types of meningitis			0
she said : ' it 's vital that everyone makes themselves aware of the signs and symptoms and remains vigilant			0
' professor @entity149 , director of immunisation at the @entity151 , said : ' the independent expert group on vaccines that advises the government is currently looking at use of this vaccine and will provide advice in due course			0

@entity160 , the most common and deadliest form of meningitis , results in death for one in 10 sufferers
approval of the new @entity91 vaccine has been hailed as the ' biggest leap forward in the field in the three decades '
has now been *deemed* safe and effective by experts
