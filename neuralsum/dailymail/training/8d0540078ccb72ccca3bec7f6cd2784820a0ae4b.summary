the @entity11 rocket lifted off from the @entity12 , about 130 miles north west of @entity13			0
the rocket contained some form of spy technology - thought to be a hi - tech replacement for @entity19 's ageing fleet of radar satellites			1
it 's not clear what capabilities the new generation might be armed with			0
observers think that the ' new generation ' spy satellites would be capable of high - resolution scans even through cloud cover and at night			2
since the launch involved a classified cargo for the @entity32 , no details were immediately available about whether it was boosted to its intended orbit			2
the reconnaissance office , which oversees the nation 's constellation of spy satellites , has kept mum about the purpose of the mission and directed @entity42 to cut off the live broadcast three minutes after lift - off			1
‘ we 've just seen the successful lift - off ’ , launch commentator @entity45 said in a webcast			1
intelligence analysts think the rocket carried a radar imaging satellite capable of seeing at night and through bad weather			0
in recent years , the @entity19 has worked to phase out its fleet of older , heavier radar reconnaissance satellites with smaller but equally capable ones , said @entity57 , a space policy analyst with the @entity59 think tank			2
people watch as a @entity3 @entity2 rocket is launched in a spacecraft - deployment flight for the government agency that operates the nation 's spy satellites such radar satellites would be able to zero in on countries of interest and see details that typical @entity73 satellites can not , experts said			1
the launch involved reconfiguring the rocket to add on two strap - on boosters to provide more thrust			0
the protective nose cone enclosing the payload also had to be made larger			0
the @entity19 spy satellite agency blacked out the broadcast after three minutes its exact ' classified ' cargo has not yet been revealed , with the @entity32 keeping mum about the purpose of the mission no information was available about whether the satellite had reached its orbit successfully after the spy - satellite agency blacked out the broadcast @entity92 top secret rocket has blasted off from the @entity9 coast - which experts believe was carrying hi - tech spy satellites that can see at night and through bad weather the @entity32 has has launched several satellites using @entity100 in the past two years , including four launches at @entity102 , @entity103 of generating nearly two million pounds of thrust , the liquid - fuel rocket has a central core booster and two strap - on boosters that make the assembly 50ft @entity107 upper second stage takes over when the first stage is exhausted			1
smoke is seen as a @entity3 @entity2 rocket is launched with a @entity5 - 25 payload			0

@entity19 cuts off broadcast three minutes after lift - off
secret satellite payload thought to be hi - tech replacement for *current* radar satellites
@entity32 will not reveal details of new satellite
experts think new ' *eye* in the *sky* ' can see through clouds and at night
