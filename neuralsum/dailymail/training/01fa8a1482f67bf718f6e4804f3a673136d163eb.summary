by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 14:49 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 15:29 est , 23 december 2013 department store @entity5 has a ' secret ' black @entity6 who can only be seen on special request , it has been revealed			1
and because the store does not advertise the service , most customers are completely unaware it is even an option			0
the @entity14 version is not publicly promoted , meaning that parents need to know what they are looking for when they bring their children to meet with the character			0
reporter @entity19 of animal @entity20 went to the flagship store in @entity23 to see how the issue of dueling @entity25 was being handled by the cheerful elves			1
she asked the big man if he was the only @entity6 in the building , and he stuck to the script			0
' that 's me - i 'm the special @entity6 , and the everyday @entity6 and the good - looking @entity6 and the ugly @entity6 and the everybody @entity6 ! ' the white @entity6 said			1
ms @entity19 then asked one of the awaiting elves and who seemed to know exactly what she was talking about when she asked for the ' special @entity6 '			2
the man directed her towards the elves in the ' maze ' of a line who could then ' set that up ' for her			0
hefty line : the wait for the white @entity6 topped out at more than 45 minutes personal attention : there was only one little girl in line waiting for the black @entity6 ' about five minutes later , an official - looking woman not dressed as an elf brought me to another lodge ... where a toddler - aged black girl and her black mother were wrapping up their time with a black @entity6 , ' ms @entity19 wrote			1
diversity issues and political correctness are not the only two reasons why the question of a black @entity6 has become a hot - topic this holiday season as @entity79 host @entity78 declared that ' @entity6 just is white '			1
she later apologized on air and said that she meant the comment comically , though that did n't stop @entity82 and @entity83 from skewering her segment			0
the black @entity6 in @entity5 's made a clear effort to stay out of the fray and avoid getting involved in the debate when asked by ms @entity19			1
' i 've heard of this story but @entity6 has n't had much time to sit down and watch tv			0
this is the busiest time of the season ! ' the black @entity6 told ms @entity19			2
@entity94 's multiple calls to @entity5 's press representatives were not immediately answered			2

@entity5 's has a second ' special ' black @entity6 ready to *greet* customers in their @entity20 store but they are only directed to him when they ask
there are no public mentions that the store offers @entity25 of different races
comes after @entity79 *anchor* @entity78 declared ' @entity6 just is white '
