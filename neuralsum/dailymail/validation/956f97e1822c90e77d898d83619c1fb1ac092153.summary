@entity1 boss @entity0 is keeping his cards close to his chest in terms of his goalkeeper selection for saturday 's @entity7 quarter - final at @entity8			1
the @entity10 derby between the two clubs at @entity12 on tuesday ended in a 2 - 1 victory for the hosts after a stoppage - time error from @entity16 saw the @entity1 and @entity18 shot - stopper give away a penalty that was converted by @entity20			1
@entity0 spoke up for @entity16 - who has kept six clean sheets in all competitions since the @entity23 took over at @entity1 - after the game			1
@entity16 is not guaranteed to keep his place against @entity8 in the @entity7 quarter - finals @entity16 brought down @entity27 to concede a penalty against @entity8 in @entity10 clash on tuesday @entity20 scored from the spot to give their midlands rivals a late victory at @entity12 and while refusing to say outright whether or not the 31 - year - old would keep his place at the weekend , the head coach once again had praise for @entity16 at his press conference on thursday to preview the cup tie			1
asked about his goalkeeper selection for saturday 's game , @entity0 said : ' i 'll be telling the goalkeepers first before i tell you ! ' @entity44 has had an injury with a finger , which we have to take into account			1
' with the number of clean sheets he has kept ( 12 overall this season ) , @entity16 has been absolutely fantastic			2
goalkeepers get highlighted , like referees , because it can cost you games			0
' @entity1 boss @entity0 has backed his no 1 without confirming @entity16 will keep his place on saturday @entity61 celebrates while being chased by his team - mates , after netting his 18th goal of the season with regard to referees , another notable incident from the latter stages of tuesday 's game saw @entity8 defender @entity70 make a nasty - looking challenge on @entity1 striker @entity61 and the pair square up to each other before each being booked			1
it appeared @entity70 was lucky not to have been sent off by referee @entity75			0
and while @entity0 was keen on thursday to avoid hitting out at the official for not doing so , he did once again express his desire for there to be a referral system for managers during games where they get ' two calls ' each , something he has spoken about in the past			1
' i 've seen the challenge back , ' said @entity0			2
@entity70 appeared to raise his studs into @entity61 's leg during @entity8 's win over @entity1 @entity61 goes down in pain on the touchline following @entity70 's nasty challenge on tuesday @entity70 and @entity61 squared up after the challenge ( left ) and were both booked by referee @entity75 ' i thought @entity97 managed the game pretty well , and there are enough people at the moment criticising referees and looking to blame them			1
' @entity97 did n't cost us the game on tuesday , we cost ourselves the game			2
' people make good decisions and bad decisions and you have to accept it - but i 'm sure he 'll look back at it and maybe will analyse it differently to how he did on the night			0
' he then added : ' i would have two calls during a game , where managers can call things back			0
' you could put advertising on the big screens ( at the same time ) - the clubs could make some money from it			0
@entity0 has labelled the alleged spitting incident involving @entity125 ( left ) and @entity126 as ' disgusting ' ' and it gives a chance to the officials to get right decisions that could be big			2
they , @entity132 and @entity133 , have to accept that referees do make mistakes			0
' @entity0 also made his feelings clear about spitting following wednesday night 's incident involving @entity138 defender @entity125 and @entity139 striker @entity126			2
' it is disgusting and disgraceful , ' @entity0 said			0
' @entity141 should never be anywhere near our game			0
it should be dealt with			0
' @entity0 , while mindful of his side 's ongoing league battle to avoid relegation , says he will try to put his ' strongest team ' out on saturday			1
@entity150 ( right ) will be given time to cope with ' personal problems ' before returning to the team forward @entity154 ( groin ) remains unavailable , and winger @entity156 is a doubt due to a foot injury			0
@entity0 has also said @entity1 ' have to go careful ' with @entity150 due to the forward 's ' personal problems ' - understood to be a family bereavement - and that there are a few ' knocks and niggles ' to deal with			1
@entity61 and fellow frontman @entity165 have both been playing recently with pain - killing injections .			0

@entity16 's mistake led to 2 - 1 defeat by @entity8 in @entity10
@entity0 has backed @entity18 keeper but would n't confirm if he will start @entity7 quarter - final clash against @entity173 on saturday
@entity1 boss wants managers to be *allowed* to challenge two referee decisions during a game
