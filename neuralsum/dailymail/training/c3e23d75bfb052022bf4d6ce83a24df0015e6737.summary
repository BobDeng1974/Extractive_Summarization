everyone knows that break ups can be hard			0
but if you thought the end of your last relationship was awkward , spare a thought for these former lovers whose text messages to their ex-partners have been shared with the world via a new @entity11 feed			2
texts from your @entity13 promises the spurned lovers , or the ones who broke their hearts the chance to share the most cringeworthy , angry , and sometimes heartbreaking messages sent by their one - time paramour			1
promising ' real texts from real exes ' , the account invites former boyfriends and girlfriends the chance to vent their anger , or share their amusement , by sending screenshots of the sms conversations in via email , or through @entity11			1
already the account has nearly 85,000 followers , with 44 posts uploaded to the photo - sharing site since it was set up a month ago			2
here are some of the best ... and worst			0
at least he has his mother : this boyfriend failed to win back the affection of his one - time flame by sharing that his mother had made him a ' delicious ' meatloaf out of a gift of meat from his ex before their split			0
sadly @entity46 was not impressed not so pukka : handing back each others possessions can be one of the hardest parts about a break up			0
and this former flame seems to want to give it one more shot before requesting the return of a @entity57 book got the message yet ? this former spouse 's request to meet up for a drink did n't go down too well , and was followed by a question on the correct way to refer to divorce proceedings ... before their conversation was shared with texts from your ex on @entity11 polite request : this goodnight message was met with more than a little anger from ' @entity74 's girlfriend ' , but she was kind enough to offer him up to her love rival when she is finished with him @entity79 is for bad break up : telling your ex they smell and look like a @entity85 character might not go down too well a year after the end of your relationship , even if they do remind you of @entity89 that clean feeling : after seven months you might think this ex-partner would have replaced their toothbrush anger : this spurned lover seems more than a little angry at their ex 's advice to ' chill ' and subsequent apology @entity102 and to the point ? the anger behind this text message seems to be coming through loud and clear trying to make it work : not even the promise of a wedding and a baby is likely to get this man back in his ex-girlfriend 's good books after taking money from her wallet unsubscribe : this former partner 's hopes of dealing with their ex-love in much the same way as an unwanted email does not appear to be working a change of heart : most exes find it a struggle to remember not to drink and text , and this drinker 's attempt at covering their texting tracks was n't much of a success either devil in disguise : calling someone @entity133 is perhaps a little mean , but this former partner did n't seem to be picking up on the fact their ex did not want to talk heartfelt : perhaps it took this ex-partner a long time to figure out their former lover was n't really interested			1
