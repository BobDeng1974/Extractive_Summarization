@entity1 scientists have discovered a protein in coffee that gives people a buzz similar to the pain reliever morphine			1
the ' previously unknown protein fragments ' had morphine - like effects that also had ' mildly tranquilising ' qualities , the scientists said			1
@entity10 is a drug that acts directly on the central nervous system to relieve pain			2
it also has a high potential for addiction			2
scientists have discovered a protein in coffee that gives people a buzz similar to the pain reliever morphine tests on laboratory mice showed that the opioid peptides , which are naturally occurring biological molecules , appeared to have a longer - lasting effect on the mice than morphine itself			1
the state - owned @entity32 , @entity32 , along with @entity33 said the discovery has ' biotechnological potential ' for the health foods industry			2
it could also help to alleviate stress in animals bound for the slaughterhouse , they claim			1
the discovery came when the two organisations were collaborating on how to improve the quality of coffee grains by combining coffee genes in new ways			2
tests on laboratory mice showed that the opioid peptides , which are naturally occurring biological molecules , appeared to have a longer - lasting effect on the mice than morphine itself they studied the coffee 's genome sequence and uncovered proteins that shared properties with those in humans			1
' this genetic library has been extremely important for our research and we are already looking for other results with different public and private partners , ' said @entity66 's research supervisor @entity65 the work is the culmination of ten year 's worth of research by the teams			0
it was originally patented in 2006 and published in the journal @entity74 in 2012			0
the team have now applied to the @entity1 government for patents for the seven proteins they have identified			1
for millions a strong coffee is the perfect start to the day			0
but in november , new research suggested coffee could also protect against dementia			0
drinking between three and five cups a day could cut the chance of developing alzheimer 's disease by up to 20 per cent , scientists said			1
nutrition can play an important role in preserving memory and thinking skills , especially during the phase of alzheimer 's disease before symptoms of dementia occur			0
this is according to a report published by the @entity98 , who are funded by major @entity101 coffee companies such as @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
however , experts from leading charities @entity106 and @entity108 today warned the research does not conclusively prove drinking coffee can prevent @entity112 's , because no clinical trials have been carried out			0
the number of cases of dementia is set to triple by 2050 , totalling 115.4 million worldwide , and alzheimer 's disease will make up the majority of these cases , according to @entity121 predictions .			0

tests on mice showed the effects lasted longer than morphine itself
it also had mildly tranquilising qualities , the @entity1 scientists said
@entity132 could alleviate stress in animals bound for the slaughter
