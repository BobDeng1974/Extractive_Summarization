by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 11 june 2013 four years ago , @entity1 was in despair , afraid she was never going to find the right medical help for her two children			1
branded an ' over-protective ' mother who was ' inventing ' illnesses for them , she had just been struck off by her gp surgery in @entity9 , @entity10			1
she had two sick children at home - @entity13 , then 12 , and @entity14 , ten - suffering from scarlet fever , and subsequently a form of pneumonia			1
this had come after a litany of other illnesses			2
desperate : turned away by her gp surgery , @entity1 despaired over the health of her two children - until she discovered the honorary doctors ' association ' anyone could see they were n't well - they seemed exhausted and did n't pick up after normal childhood illnesses , ' says @entity1 , 48 , a charity volunteer who is married to @entity29 , 58 , a psychologist			1
' i took them to the gp a number of times , and eventually waited for the out - of - hours service to click in as i felt i got better care then			1
the children were both treated with antibiotics but neither seemed to be getting better			1
' they needed to see a paediatric consultant but i could n't get a referral			2
' indeed , the gp surgery 's response was a letter informing the family that ' due to a breakdown in relationships ' they would no longer treat them			1
' i felt as if the @entity49 washed its hands of us , ' says @entity1			1
desperate , she called a private doctor , although she could not afford prolonged private treatment - and the secretary suggested she contact a new organisation , the @entity56			1
this charity offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and @entity49 consultants and gps in the country			1
it was set up four years ago by @entity65 , an ophthalmologist , to help people crying out for a second opinion after they have been failed or misdiagnosed by the @entity49 or private practice in the @entity69			2
' many of the people we see are genuinely in despair , ' says mr @entity65			2
' we provide a lifeline which is free at the point of care			1
' we do not see ourselves as operating “ in competition ” with the @entity49 and fully support its core principles			2
we are not a political organisation			2
we simply offer a second opinion			2
' if an @entity49 doctor disagrees with our diagnosis , it 's up to the patient to decide which advice to @entity86 first i was concerned we might encounter opposition from doctors , but in fact we have been met with tremendous goodwill			1
' we now have around 140 private and @entity49 doctors and consultants registered with us , but there are around 900 doctors in the @entity69 i can ring and ask for advice , and so far no one has refused to help			1
relief : now that @entity1 and her children have been accurately diagnosed by the @entity56 , they can lead happy , normal lives ' i have developed quite a thick skin in ringing up eminent consultants and saying : “ look , could you see this person for free ? ” the majority of doctors see their profession as a calling , and are frustrated by the limitations under which they have to work			1
' many gps have only about eight minutes to see a patient , and some are seeing 60 patients a day			2
almost inevitably there will be misdiagnosis , lack of knowledge and wrong treatments occurring			2
' the @entity56 ( soon to be renamed the @entity122 ) was set up after mr van @entity65 realised he was treating one in ten of his patients free , as they could n't afford to pay him			1
' i rang around other specialists and consultants and found many did the same			2
i thought if we formed ourselves into a network , we could offer this vital second opinion service			2
' he emailed 200 eminent consultants and doctors , and more than half replied immediately that they would become involved			1
last year the charity helped almost 200 patients			1
its helpline is manned by just mr @entity65 and a staff of two			0
' i listen to their case , then call on my specialists and refer their cases on			0
most patients can see a specialist within weeks			0
' we see people who have exhausted every avenue in the @entity49 , been given inadequate explanations , insufficient follow - ups or have been misdiagnosed			0
many could never afford to see a private doctor for a second opinion			0
' for @entity1 , the relief of being able to speak to a medical professional was ' immense '			1
' mr @entity65 became an “ umbrella ” mentor for our care			0
he researched our case and made invaluable suggestions			0
' with the @entity56 's help , @entity1 discovered that she and her children suffer from an auto - immune condition , @entity165 ( or ' sticky blood ' ) , where the blood clots too quickly			1
patients often have intense migraines - @entity14 is particularly prone to these , which also caused him to vomit ; he used to suffer from blackouts , too			0
as well as @entity165 , @entity13 and her mother have systemic lupus , another auto - immune condition , which causes joint pain and extreme fatigue			0
with the right diagnosis and care , the children now lead happy , normal lives			1
@entity14 , who takes daily aspirin and a drug called plaquenil , no longer has blackouts and both children are doing well at school - @entity14 is also schooled partly at home			1
@entity1 has found a new gp practice , which she describes as ' excellent ' , and sees various paediatric experts			1
' the @entity56 gave me a sense of security and professional support at a difficult time , ' she says			0
for two years , @entity194 , an it consultant in the @entity195 , struggled to get specialist treatment for persistent and increasingly crippling pain above his knee , caused by a footballing injury			1
' i was constantly fobbed off by my gp , who said the pain would go away , but it was getting progressively worse			1
he 'd just give me more painkillers , ' says the 45 - year - old from @entity205 , @entity206			0
the pain became so excruciating that he could n't walk more than 40 metres			0
' i finally stood in my gp 's surgery and said i would refuse to leave until i was referred to a consultant			1
' an orthopaedic consultant said - wrongly , it turned out - that the problem was fragments of bone in his ankle , and @entity194 had an operation to remove these			2
lifeline : the @entity56 offers free advice and treatment from some of the most eminent private and @entity49 consultants and gps in the country when the pain persisted , an ultrasound scan - the first he 'd been offered - revealed the real cause : a blood clot above his knee			1
' my consultant said i might need an artery bypass but this would n't be available for at least two years			0
' a year later , with the pain badly affecting his daily life , @entity194 was at the end of his tether			0
a colleague mentioned the @entity56 and he was referred to @entity239 , a world - leading vascular surgeon working privately in @entity241			0
' for the first time , i felt someone was really listening			0
he said if i 'd been given the right treatment in the beginning it would have cleared the clot , but now it was too big and i would need a bypass			2
' having an eminent surgeon confirm the diagnosis was such a relief			2
he also recommended daily exercises that eased the pain			0
' i 'm now armed with expert knowledge to fight my case for a bypass operation on the @entity49			0
' retired nursery nurse @entity258 credits the @entity56 with saving her sight			0
@entity258 , 63 , from @entity260 in @entity261 , had been taking strong painkillers for 15 years for back pain			0
around four years ago , her sight started deteriorating			0
' my gp said it was glaucoma			2
gradually , my sight became worse and worse and i could only see a pinpoint of light			0
i could n't drive , i could barely read and hardly left the house			0
i was told there was nothing that could be done			0
' @entity1 went to @entity273			1
' i said i could n't afford lengthy private treatment , and he said he 'd treat me for free			1
' he investigated tirelessly , and finally told me he did n't think it was glaucoma but a toxic build - up from the painkillers			0
he advised me to stop taking one , and gave me daily b12 vitamin injections ' over a matter of months , my eyesight began to return			0
i firmly believe that but for the work of the @entity56 , i would be blind			0
' the @entity56 is ' only a small organisation ' , says mr @entity65 , ' but we are growing all the time '			0
he adds : ' we do n't feel we hold all the answers , but we do our best to help			0
with the patient 's permission , we like to write to their gp saying what we would recommend			1
' for @entity1 , the crucial thing was that an expert was really listening			1
' i felt , for the first time in years , as if someone actually cared			0
