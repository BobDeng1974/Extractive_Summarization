a former alleged girlfriend of prince @entity1 has blasted claims an underage ‘ sex slave ’ was forced to sleep with him - saying the @entity6 is one of the ' most decent ' people she knows			1
former @entity10 model @entity9 claims she has been a close friend of @entity1 since they were first linked in 2000 , and is confident @entity13 ’ allegations she was forced to have sex with him in the @entity16 while aged 17 and working as a masseuse for convicted paedophile @entity18 are fabricated			1
the scandal – first revealed in @entity16 court documents last week , in which miss @entity13 , now 30 , claimed she had been forced to have sex with the prince three times between 2001 and 2002 – have been vehemently denied by @entity24			1
' there is not an ounce of truth to these false allegations			0
' @entity9 , 50 , is the first of the women prince @entity1 has been linked to since his 1996 divorce from @entity44 to come speak out on his behalf			1
@entity44 has already launched an impassioned defence of her ex-husband , telling reporters @entity1 is ' the greatest man there is '			1
the prince , 54 , has also been linked to another former @entity10 model , @entity16 actress @entity52 , bikini model @entity53 and model and actress @entity56 - not to mention rocker @entity57			1
so far , they have all kept quiet over the allegations			0
an @entity16 journalist has revealed she tried to expose @entity18 's predatory behaviour 11 years ago - but @entity62 refused to print it			1
@entity64 , a contributing editor at the magazine for 11 years , was asked to profile the billionaire back in 2003			0
in a blog for @entity68 , ms @entity64 - who describes @entity18 as a ' gatsby-esque character ' - describes how she was made uncomfortable almost immediately			2
' @entity18 had invited me to an off - the - record tea at his @entity75 house ( during which i distinctly remember he rudely ate all the finger food himself ) and then had his assistant call to tell me he ’d thought i was pretty , ' she recalls			2
but it was n't the unwanted compliment which worried her : it was - among other things - a conversation she had with a mother of a 16 - year - old @entity18 had allegedly molested			2
' he ’d gotten to them because of his money , ' ms @entity64 wrote , adding : ' the girls ’ mother told me by phone that she had thought her daughters would be safe under @entity18 ’s roof , not least because he phoned her to reassure her , and she also knew he had @entity27 with him at all times			1
' but when she tried to include the account in her final piece , it was pulled			0
a @entity62 spokesman told the @entity68 the decision was taken because “ @entity18 denied the charges at the time and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated , we decided not to include them in what was a financial story ”			1
but ms @entity64 - who said @entity18 had ' a way of spooking you ' - says it was n't a financial piece - adding : ' it has often struck me that if my piece had named the women , the @entity117 might have come after @entity18 sooner and perhaps some of his victims , now , in the latest spate of allegations , allegedly either paid off or too fearful of retribution to speak up , would have been saved			2
' however , it was @entity9 who forewarned of a lack of security around @entity1 , when she met him during one of his business trips as an official representative of @entity132 in 2000			1
these trips would later prove controversial after it was alleged he was using taxpayers ’ money to fund a lavish lifestyle while on official business			0
@entity9 met @entity1 in @entity29 , where they are said to have had a three - day romance , during which he invited her to his room alone on two consecutive nights			1
speaking in 2001 , @entity9 said : ' the nights i was alone with him in his room he never had any security with him			1
' i had only just met him			0
but i walked straight to his room			0
i knocked on the door and he opened it			0
party : @entity150 ( above ) said she met prince @entity1 in the exclusive resort in @entity152 ' he 'd given me his room number , his code name , his private mobile phone number , everything			2
' he gave the mobile number to me on the first night after i 'd only known him a few hours			0
there was never any security there			0
the president would never have been left alone like that			0
i was worried for him			0
' during their time together , the @entity1 was said to have stripped to his boxer shorts and allowed @entity9 - who now works for @entity167 ’s music publishing company , @entity166 – to tuck him into bed			1
@entity9 's support for @entity1 follows hot on the heels of one of @entity18 's troupe of girls saying she was ' dumbfounded ’ by claims the @entity1 abused a girl at an under - age orgy			1
@entity150 told how she was one of a group of young women flown by the billionaire on his private jet to @entity152 in @entity181 for an evening of entertainment in 2001			0
‘ i flew on @entity18 ’s private jet and we had dinner with @entity1 , ' miss @entity150 revealed			1
he was wonderful and a gentleman			0
’ she described @entity188 ’ claims as ‘ extremely unlikely ’ , telling the @entity190 : ‘ i ’m dumbfounded			2
i ca n’t believe he took part in anything like that			0
he was nothing but pleasant to me			0
’ ‘ if everything that went down the way she said , i just have a hard time believing it because they ( @entity18 and his friends ) are not people like that			1
’ in 2011 , @entity1 , fifth in line to the @entity132 throne , stepped down from his role as @entity132 @entity209 over his friendship with @entity18 , who by that time was a convicted sex offender			1
@entity18 , 61 , a billionaire financier , completed 13 months in jail on a charge of soliciting sex with an underage girl after striking a plea deal in 2008			1
despite @entity18 ’s conviction he was photographed walking with @entity1 in @entity217 , @entity218 , after his release			1
@entity18 and ex-girlfriend @entity27 are both named in the legal papers lodged in @entity16 @entity18 also stands accused of trying to cover up his actions by tracking down witnesses and warning them against testifying against him			2
however , miss @entity13 and four alleged other victims – who have not been identified – continue to make allegations against @entity18			2
@entity18 has denied the claims , saying they are made up			1
miss @entity13 claims she was recruited to be a personal ‘ masseuse ’ to the disgraced tycoon when she was just 15 and that she was abused by ‘ royalty ’ , ‘ politicians ’ and ‘ academicians ’ while under his employment			2
she subsequently moved to @entity233 , married and had three children , but later returned to the @entity16 where she co-operate with the @entity117 investigating @entity18 ’s dealings			2
she said in 2011 : ‘ i am anxious			0
i am still frightened of him because he has so much power			0
i had to put this behind me			0
' but in the end this is not for me			0
it ’s because i ’m afraid there are a lot of girls still doing what i did for him , eight years after i left			0
i want to be the one who breaks the chain			0
’ there is no suggestion @entity1 was aware of any pressure being exerted on @entity188 , who has gone into hiding in @entity254 since her explosive claims about @entity1 and @entity18 were filed at a courthouse in @entity257 , @entity258 , last week			1

@entity9 comes out in support of her ' friend of 15 years '
former @entity10 model calls @entity6 ' one of the most decent people i know '
@entity1 is *engulfed* by claims ' sex slave ' was forced to sleep with him
@entity275 warned in 2001 security surrounding the @entity1 was too relaxed
comes after one of @entity18 's girls said she was ' dumbfounded ' by claims
