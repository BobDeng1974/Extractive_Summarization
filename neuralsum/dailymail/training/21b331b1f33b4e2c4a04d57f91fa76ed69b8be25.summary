' an attorney for mr @entity0 's wife has also released a statement , denying his client is a victim and that she believes the injuries were an accident			1
the statement reads : ' @entity14 was stunned by the news today and she is devastated			1
she did not believe , and does not believe , that her husband intended to injure her and she believes that he is not guilty of any crime			0
' she is worried about her family 's privacy and concerned that she and her family are going to be subjected to ridicule , embarrassment and hatred because of this decision			0
' in fact , she has already seen that beginning to happen			0
' it is unfortunate that no one seemed to care what she wants , and that the authorities gave little or no weight to her view of the facts of the case			0

charges in the case were later dropped			0

more important than that is i believe you need to be proactive , ' he said			0
' based on our experience to date , we believe that the appropriate procedures are in effect that we can do what we need to do on a case - by - case basis , ' @entity139 told @entity158			2
' if and when something needs to be addressed in terms of discipline , it will be			0
but more importantly we try to focus , with the @entity163 , on educating and counselling			0
