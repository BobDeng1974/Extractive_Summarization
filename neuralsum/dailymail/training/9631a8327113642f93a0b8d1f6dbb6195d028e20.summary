' the second rider follows very closely behind her			0
if you slow the video right down you can see that he hits a pothole and veers over the road into the path of our truck after coming out of a corner			2
' there is a collision but thankfully the motorcyclist is lucky and he escapes with a broken shoulder			1
' the footage shows the moment the biker hits the pothole in the @entity75 as he rounds a country bend initially following another bike , the rider then loses control and slides across road into the path of the truck the bike then ploughs into the front of the lorry and a cloud of smoke rises as it is ripped to shreds the owner of the lorry says he is pleased he was using the camera , which showed his driver was not to blame mr @entity45 added : ' he is already coming off the bike at the point of impact and he ends up falling to the side of our truck			1
' our driver is understandably badly shaken by what has happened and is immediately given a week off work to recover			0
' the police quite properly investigate the incident and the first thing they want to see is the footage from @entity106			0
' this shows quite clearly that our driver is blameless and there is no case to answer			0
