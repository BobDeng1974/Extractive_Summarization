by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 20:01 est , 2 may 2013 as a former hostage of @entity4 pirates , ex-sea captain @entity1 has a grim tale to tell			1
so he was stunned to arrive at a @entity7 meeting and find the members wearing eye patches , wigs and fake wooden legs while brandishing plastic cutlasses			0
they had been told their 75 - year - old guest would be talking to them about piracy – so several turned up in fancy dress			2
blunder : members of the @entity21 with pirates ' kidnapping victim @entity1 , centre the horrified women then discovered he was there to discuss how he was savagely beaten and held at gunpoint during a 47 - day ordeal in the @entity28 in 2008			1
but captain @entity1 reacted with good humour to the blunder and carried on his talk as planned			1
‘ they seemed to be a little embarrassed but it did n’t offend me in the slightest , ’ he said yesterday at home in @entity34 , @entity35			0
‘ it ’s been five years now and sometimes i have to remind myself just how terrifying and frightening it was			0
in any event , the ladies did n’t look the slightest bit like @entity4 pirates – more like the @entity45			2
speaker : mr @entity1 , 75 , was held hostage by armed rebels for 47 days in 2008 ‘ in the end they asked me to select the best costume			1
i gave them all marks out of ten			0
it was just a bit of fun			0
’ captain @entity1 was held hostage by 20 gun - toting pirates after they leapt aboard his @entity59 ship , the @entity60 , in the @entity61			1
four @entity63 crew members were ordered to lie down on the deck but the captain and his @entity67 engineer , @entity66 , 68 , were needed to sail the 115ft vessel			2
his haunting account describes how he was struck over the head and warned he would be shot if his crew disobeyed their captors			0

six weeks later a rumoured £ 350,000 ransom was agreed and the crew were freed			0
captain @entity1 returned to @entity35 where he was reunited with wife @entity78 , 70 , and began writing about the terrifying episode for a book , @entity81			1
his talk was delivered to the @entity84 branch in @entity85 , a village a few miles from his home			1
the @entity84 ’s 21 members , whose ages range from the mid- 40s to the 80s , like to liven up their monthly events with fancy - dress competitions			1
spokesman @entity92 said : ‘ we did n’t know much about him but the notes said he was captain @entity1 and he was talking about piracy			1
‘ i thought he was from a local fund - raising group who dress up as pirates to raise money for charity			2
naturally everyone was aghast when we realised our mistake			0
‘ there he was delivering this harrowing story about how he was held hostage and feared for his life , and we were all sitting there dressed as captain hook			1
