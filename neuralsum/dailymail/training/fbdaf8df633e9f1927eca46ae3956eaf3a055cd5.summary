by @entity0 a mysterious @entity2 - like cloud made homeowners in @entity4 this morning do a double take as it appeared to hover close to the ground			1
@entity8 , 37 , from @entity9 , @entity7 caught sight of the strange - looking out over her back garden at 9.30am			2
she said : ' i was just looking out from my home in @entity9 when i saw the cloud			0
' it looked like a @entity2 and i had to double take before i realised it was actually a cloud			2
' strange sighting : it was likely that the odd cloud in @entity21 sky was formed in the @entity23 mountains ' i 've never seen anything like it before , but apparently they 're called lenticular clouds			1
' it 's very weird			0
' a number of @entity30 took to social networking sites to say they had seen the @entity2 - shaped cloud as well			2
@entity34 said : ' i also got a photo of this when i was at @entity37 at 10am ... amazing			0
' @entity38 added : ' @entity39			0
' spooky : the sight @entity8 saw in her back garden in @entity9 this morning lenticular clouds form when stable moist air flows over a range of mountains			1
the clouds have been mistaken for ufos in the past because of their smooth saucer - like shape			1
a @entity53 spokeswoman said the cloud was likely to have been formed over the @entity23			0
she said : ' these photos show an excellent example of a cloud called @entity58			0
' lenticular clouds can form at heights between 6,500 and 16,500 ft , and are called lenticular because of their lens shape confusion : lenticular clouds like these are thought to account for many of false @entity2 sightings around the world ' the clouds can be seen as far as 60 miles downwind of the hills or mountains that led to their formation and they are believed to be one of the most common explanations for @entity2 sightings across the world			1
' they can be seen at any time of year as long as the atmospheric condition are right			0
' both the clouds and the high temperatures are a result of the way the wind was blowing on monday morning - from west to east - this means the western side of @entity4 is seeing cloud and rain , but as the air moves over the mountains it becomes dry and cloud free allowing the temperatures to rise			1

one *resident* said they did a ' double take ' before realising it what it was
the strange - looking cloud is the result of moist air near mountains
lenticular clouds account for many false @entity2 sightings around the country because of their saucer - like shape
