by @entity0 an amateur astronomer has discovered a 170 million - year - old dying sun using a homemade telescope set up in his garden shed			1
@entity5 , 42 , from @entity6 , spotted the star , thought to be 100 times the size of ours , on @entity10 using equipment he built himself			1
' it was 11 o'clock at night when i actually got the first look at this and by 1am i was fairly certain and at that time of night there was nothing else for it but a strong cup of tea , ' he said			0
amateur astronomer @entity5 with the telescope he built himself for his @entity22 in @entity6 ' what excites me about this one this time is the telescope - i built it myself , right down to the polishing of the lenses			1
' software developer mr @entity5 has discovered three supernovae or exploding stars over four years from a shed at the bottom of his garden			1
the success rate is all the more significant as @entity37 only averages six to 12 clear skies a month and the nights from may to august are too bright to hunt for the celestial phenomenon			0
the latest discovery was confirmed over the weekend by the @entity40 which gave it the unique name @entity43			1
it was made in a galaxy which at this time of year appears beside the constellation known to most people as the @entity48 , or @entity48			0
' you wo n't see any trace of this looking at the night sky with the naked eye , it 's about 100,000 times fainter than what you can see , ' mr @entity5 said			2
@entity5 ( left ) and his wife @entity56 in an observatory in their back garden in @entity22 , north @entity6 mr @entity5 , 39 , said he was about to finish up a night 's stargazing when he spotted the star in the heavens over his home in @entity64 , north @entity6 the international astronomy authorities have now officially confirmed mr @entity5 's discovery as a supernova the stargazer has written a specific computer program with complex algorithms and criteria to allow his telescopes to target certain galaxies at certain times even if he is not in the shed			1
he then reviews hundreds of images with the naked eye			0
' i do n't think i could do this if i had kids , but now when i think about it maybe it would be beneficial enough if i was up half the night and bottle feeding , ' mr @entity5 said			2
' but one of the misconceptions is that i 'm out there in the freezing cold and dark with a big coat on me looking through a telescope at the night sky - sometimes , or most of the time , when i 'm looking for these things i 'm inside watching the television			0
' mr @entity5 's telescope is in a shed in his back garden that has a retractable roof the stargazer has written a specific computer program with complex algorithms and criteria to allow his telescopes to target certain galaxies at certain times even if he is not in the shed software developer mr @entity5 has discovered three supernovae or exploding stars over four years from a shed at the bottom of his garden the @entity103 was carried into orbit by a @entity105 in 1990 @entity103 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared its orbit outside the distortion of @entity113 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high - resolution images with almost no background light @entity103 's @entity116 has recorded some of the most detailed visible - light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time the telescope is one of @entity124 's @entity123 , along with the @entity125 , the @entity126 and the @entity127 @entity103 is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts its scientific successor , the @entity131 is currently scheduled to be launched by @entity124 in 2018			1
when mr @entity5 made his second supernova discovery in 2012 he was contacted by @entity133 which admitted its scientists had failed to pick up on the discovery weeks earlier			2
planets and asteroids can be named but the fleeting supernovae are registered according to the year of discovery			0
they are the spectacular explosion of a star or sun like ours , caused by a violent collapse or the weight of material being pulled into its orbit			0
mr @entity5 made the first discovery of a supernova from @entity152 soil in 2010 and two years before that he discovered an asteroid - a minor planet three metres wide - and named it after his late mother , @entity155 , who encouraged his interest in the stars when he was a boy			1
@entity158 , head of @entity37 , said : ' he 's certainly @entity37 's most prolific supernova hunter			0
' despite his success in his spare time mr @entity5 has quite a way to go to top the success rate of @entity162 , a retired telescope maker originally from @entity164 who has more than 100 discoveries to his name and an asteroid named in his honour .			2

@entity5 , 42 , from @entity6 , spotted the star on @entity10
170 - million - year - old star thought to be 100 times the size of ours
he has discovered these exploding stars over four years
@entity180 was confirmed by the @entity40
