' it was just a beautiful , pristine place on the bayou			0
and now that 's gone , and we just do n't feel safe about what 's underneath us			1
' residents who want to stay are wrestling with the same fears as their fleeing neighbors : is it safe ? will the slow - growing sinkhole undermine the area 's infrastructure , including @entity40 70 ? and will the natural gas bubbling to the surface on the bayou accumulate in confined spaces and cause an explosion ? although parish officials have said they do n't think either will happen , they are monitoring both issues			1
