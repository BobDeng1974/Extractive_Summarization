by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 7 august 2013 generous : former postman @entity1 left £ 65,000 to the care home which looked after him - and the money has now grown to £ 637,000 pensioners living in a remote care home in the @entity6 are set to receive a £ 637,000 windfall thanks to a former resident who died more than 30 years ago			1
veteran postman @entity1 , who passed away in 1983 , left his entire £ 65,000 savings to @entity10 in @entity11 where he had lived during his final years			1
but when the home closed 12 years ago , the money effectively lay dormant			1
the restrictive wording of mr @entity1 's will meant it could not be transferred to the new home which replaced @entity17 , named @entity18 in his honour			1
after years of legal wrangling , local council bosses have finally been able to put the money into a trust fund and allow it to be disbursed			1
during the time it has been left untouched , the money has grown by a staggering 880 % because of interest rates and is now worth around £ 637,000			1
@entity28 is known about how mr @entity1 - known as ‘ @entity29 ’ to pals - managed to save up £ 65,000 before his death as he only ever earned as much as £ 20 a week during his 50 year stint as a postman between 1908 and 1958			1
one of his workmates @entity35 recalled that @entity1 never had any children , never smoked and never drank , which is why he had more money than most			2
according to @entity35 , @entity1 ’s idea of a night out was to pop down to the @entity40 for a game of snooker			0
but @entity35 believes most of @entity1 ’s money was probably inherited as he had a big family , with one brother working in @entity46 and another dabbling in stocks and shares			2
@entity1 , who started his service as an auxiliary postman at @entity51 , @entity52 , on november 28 , 1908 , was said to have cycled 205,000 miles and walked about 50,000 miles in the course of his duty as a postman			0
windfall : residents of @entity58 care home in @entity11 , @entity60 , are set to benefit from a £ 637,000 investment in limbo : the money mr @entity1 left to @entity64 , pictured as it is today , was untouched for years due to legal difficulties in 1913 , he became a full - time employee at @entity51 , but his term was disrupted when he joined the @entity68 in 1915 and served in @entity69 during the @entity70			1
he was twice wounded , in 1917 and 1918 , and in 1919 was discharged			0
when he returned home he worked as a postman in @entity11 where he remained until he retired in 1958 where he was given a clock for his 50 years of service and had ‘ for he ’s a @entity76 ’ sung to him at a ceremony			0
@entity1 spent his final few years at @entity78 and died at @entity79 , @entity11 , in 1982 , aged 86			2
the terms of his will read simply : ' i leave and bequeath the whole residue of my said means and estate to @entity10 , @entity11			0
' the money even went missing for seven years after @entity86 , which was holding on to the cash , was broken up in march 1996 to become @entity88			0
old friend : former workmate @entity35 suggested @entity1 may have saved up his fortune by living an austere lifestyle kind - hearted : @entity1 , pictured on his last round as a postman in 1958 , cycled thousands of miles during his career by the time it was found again in 2003 , @entity17 had closed down and the money - which had already risen in value to a staggering £ 345,000 by then - was untouchable			1
@entity99 chiefs today confirmed their solicitors had managed to set up a trust fund to put the money in which will be used to help look after the elderly in @entity11			1
a spokesman said : ' following lengthy negotiations , the @entity105 has approved the council ’s application to vary the terms of the bequest to enable funds to be disbursed			0
' the application for charitable status for what had become known as the @entity115 was made late last year and confirmation has now been received that it has been approved			0
' the revised terms of the bequest now allows it to be used for the benefit of the elderly community in the @entity11 area and for the " relief of those in need by reason of advanced age "			0
' @entity128 , a support worker at @entity58 said : ' @entity29 wanted @entity17 to receive the money after he was gone as he was so grateful for the support they gave him there			2
' that money made such a difference to @entity17 , until it shut			2
' although eight or nine of the residents actually moved from there to @entity58 when it shut , @entity29 ’s money was n’t able to be transferred - all we got in the end was @entity17 ’s old bus			1
' so i think it ’s absolutely brilliant that the money will see the light of day again			0
@entity29 left this money for the elderly of @entity11 and finally it ’s them that will receive it again			0
' i think he would proud to see this news today , it ’s what he always wanted			0

@entity1 left £ 65,000 savings to @entity17 care home in @entity60
money left in limbo when it closed down 12 years ago
restrictive wording of his will meant it could not be transferred
meanwhile , interest and stock prices have seen bequest soar to £ 637,000
legal wranglings now *resolved* and trust fund will *disperse* money to elderly
