by @entity0 good news : @entity2 today claims that three million will be exempt from income tax when a rise in the threshold takes effect on sunday three million workers will have been taken out of income tax altogether when a rise in the tax threshold takes effect on sunday , @entity2 will say today			1
the prime minister will issue a defiant message to @entity14 mps who have been calling for more help for higher - rate taxpayers , as he embarks on a tour of the @entity18 to talk up the economy			1
he will insist that it is right to have targeted the basic - rate threshold – saying it is among his proudest achievements			1
and mr @entity2 will highlight new figures from @entity25 showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £ 1,824 for the typical taxpayer			1
more than 26million people will benefit from the government ’s latest increase in the point at which people start to pay tax , which will reach £ 10,000 on sunday			2
the increase will take another 200,000 part - time and lower - paid workers out of income tax entirely , most of them women			1
this means the total who do not pay tax will reach three million for the first time			0
a full - time employee on the minimum wage will pay nearly two - thirds less income tax than at the last election , while someone working for around 30 hours a week will not pay any at all			2
this year ’s rise means that the typical taxpayer is now paying £ 705 a year less in income tax than they were in 2010			1
ahead of a meeting in the @entity54 today with workers who will benefit , the prime minister said : ‘ a key part of this government ’s long - term economic plan is to cut taxes so that people can keep more of the money they earn and feel more financially secure			2
' nearly nine out of ten hard - working people across the country will benefit from this tax cut on sunday - and it ’s one of the proudest things i have done in @entity58			2
’ the prime minister ’s remarks are likely to irritate the @entity70 , who claim the credit for making personal allowance increases the government ’s top tax priority			0
mr @entity2 is also expected to hail the latest corporation tax cut from 23 per cent to 21 per cent , which takes effect this week			0
it has fallen from 28 per cent in 2010 and will fall further to 20 per cent in april 2015			0
the employment allowance also comes into effect – giving 1.25 million businesses and charities up to £ 2,000 off their national insurance contributions			0
a little less taxing : mr @entity2 will highlight new figures from @entity25 showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £ 1,824 for the typical taxpayer mr @entity2 has rejected growing calls for a halt to the number of middle - class professionals being sucked into the higher 40p rate of tax , the threshold for which has not been increased in line with the 20p threshold			1
senior @entity14 including two former chancellors and @entity103 mayor @entity102 have urged mr @entity104 to indicate he wants to ease the 40p squeeze on these workers			0
but the chancellor used last week ’s budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £ 10,500 from april 2015 , while rejecting pleas to stop more people being dragged into the 40p tax band , which kicks in at £ 41,450			1
it will be increased by just one per cent from next year , below inflation			0
ministers insist that despite this , anyone earning up to £ 100,000 is better off thanks to the government ’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance .			0

@entity124 will issue defiant message to mps calling for relief for higher - rate payers
@entity25 figures show typical taxpayers have saved £ 1,824 over the parliament
new change in threshold will stop 200,000 workers from paying income tax
