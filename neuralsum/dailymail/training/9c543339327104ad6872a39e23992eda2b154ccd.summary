rev @entity0 said he was n't just a chaplain but a counsellor to all faiths every week for ten years the @entity4 visited the shop floor at @entity6 , offering counselling and advice to the luxury car maker 's workers			1
but only days before @entity11 he has been made redundant because the company says he might offend non-christians			1
it said there were too many religions represented among the 4,000 - strong workforce at its factory to warrant a @entity20 chaplain			1
mr @entity0 called the decision ' ridiculous ' and said he spoke to workers of all faiths			1
staff have started a campaign to reinstate the vicar , who they said was an ' important figure ' who had even helped one employee who had been on the brink of suicide			1
mr @entity0 was directly employed by @entity6 â€“ it would pay the @entity32 , which would then transfer the funds to the chaplain			1
he had outside roles , but this was his only paid work			2
he said : ' it is just beyond belief			0
the reason i have been given is that there are too many people of different faiths to warrant a @entity20 chaplain			1
everyone thinks it is quite ridiculous			0
there have been no complaints against me and my position is to help people and not just those who are @entity53			1
' he said he had been told to leave immediately after bosses said they needed to take a ' multi-faith outlook '			0
he would visit the factory in @entity58 , @entity59 , once a week for six hours , and also ran @entity20 courses and wrote a message in the firm 's newsletters			0
' it is not just about offering religious services , ' he said			0
' i provide counselling to workers who have stresses at home such as broken marriages			2
i would spend a few minutes with each person which would be enough to help them feel better			0
' i feel that there is something else behind this			0
' mr @entity0 said there had been a change since the appointment of new personnel by @entity83 firm @entity82 , which took over the @entity85 brand in 1998			1
a @entity87 and @entity88 outside @entity6 headquarters in @entity58 , @entity59			0
staff have started a petition calling for @entity91 to be reinstated ' there have been many new faces around recently and i noticed i was being watched when i was talking to some of the staff even if it was just for a matter of seconds or minutes			1
i knew something was going on and that there was trouble ahead			0
' yesterday one worker said : ' we have started a petition as we want him back			1
everyone is really angry about it			0
' retired employee @entity107 , 67 , said : ' he was there for a lot of people			2
i know one individual who was feeling suicidal , but @entity0 turned him around			2
' he was a very important man at the factory			0
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we have a wide range of faiths and want to take a multi-faith outlook			2
it would be very difficult to have somebody from each faith			0
' this now gives us the opportunity to look at this and recognise the range of faiths we have here			2
