by @entity0 published : 03:31 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 08:18 est , 22 march 2013 these ghostly images reveal the forgotten harbour built off the coast of @entity4 that for six months after d - day became the world 's busiest docks			1
@entity9 scientists have found the remnants of @entity11 on the @entity13 seabed , which allowed the @entity14 to land troops , vehicles and equipment on @entity19 soil without having to capture a port first			1
the makeshift harbour , nicknamed @entity22 because it was the brainchild of @entity24 , was the size of @entity26 and is considered to be one of the greatest military achievements of all time			1
discovery : the foundations of an breakwaters of @entity11 - the celebrated @entity34 harbour of @entity4 - has been found by @entity9 scientists remarkable : the temporary harbour ( pictured in 1944 ) was @entity24 's brainchild and allowed troop , vehicles , weapons and supplies to be brought into @entity19 with ease vast : a vertical aerial photograph of @entity11 taken by @entity42 on 27 october 1944 shows its scale and design its development was even described by @entity49 - @entity48 's architect and armaments minister - as ' genius '			1
it allowed 220,000 men , 50,000 vehicles and 600,000 tones of supplies to be landed in @entity19 and undoubtedly helped win the war			2
experts from the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , which is part of the @entity61 , have found that its structure still remains remarkably intact just months before the 69th anniversary of its construction			1
they fired a ' multi-beam echo sounder ' at the sea bed off @entity67 and the 3d images it produced show that large sunken ' beetles ' , which supported floating roadways , can be found at a depth of five metres			1
there are also large chunks of breakwater structures			1
which protected it from storms			2
' it was amazing to discover how much remained despite being pounded by the sea for all those years , ' said @entity82 , who was leading the @entity59 research			2
structure : this 3d image shows a concrete beetle resting upright on the seafloor just north of the historic harbour haunting : the long length of breakwaters and floating ' beetles ' has been found at a depth of five metres off the @entity4 coast @entity24 had proposed a similar concept in @entity95 but it became a reality in the next war thanks to @entity99 engineer @entity98			1
@entity11 was one of two temporary harbours built after @entity102			2
@entity22 was installed at @entity103 , for @entity105 invasion forces ; @entity11 was set up at @entity106 ( @entity107 ) for the @entity9 and @entity108			1
only two weeks after d - day , a massive storm destroyed @entity111 also sustained some damage , but was reinforced to keep it operable at least until the end of october			2
@entity24 personally ordered the temporary harbours , sending a directive on may 30 , 1942 to @entity117 ( centre ) , the head of combined operations			2
@entity48 's architect @entity49 ( far right , with the @entity122 ) called the jetties ' an idea of simple genius ' @entity11 was left open until november 19 and @entity98 was involved throughout , making adjustments and reinforcements			1
the pre-fabricated harbours were towed across the @entity13 in chunks and put into place on the @entity4 beaches			1
the plans were drawn up during an intensive seven - week period , from june 17 to august 6 , 1942 - two years before @entity102			2
@entity24 personally ordered the temporary harbours , sending a directive on may 30 , 1942 to @entity134 , the head of combined operations			0
it stated curtly : ' @entity137 on beaches			0
they must float up and down with the tide			0
the anchor problem must be mastered			0
let me have the best solution worked out			0
do n’t argue the matter			0
the difficulties will argue for themselves			0
' defence : a photo taken from the gun turret at high tide , probably showing @entity11 's western breakwater			1
note the open tops and gun turrets , equipped with a 40mm anti aircraft gun pride : @entity155 being built in a dry dock in @entity9 , probably in @entity157 , before they were shipped across the channel @entity98 was chosen to head the project with instructions to prepare plans for ' prototypes of landing piers to be towed across the @entity13 and sunk into place '			1
the piers were to be ' capable of carrying the heaviest tanks and artillery ... [ and ] of being towed from one assault beach to another ...			0
' he would also have to account for projected tidal and wind conditions at the beaches in @entity19			0
tasked with validating the plans , @entity98 selected the estuary of the @entity177 in @entity178 as a test site			0
historic : this original sketch is by @entity99 engineer @entity98 , who devised two types of device , codenamed ' @entity184 ' ( concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads ) and ' @entity187 ' ( steel roadways linking them together ) today : remains of @entity11 at @entity106 ( @entity191 beach ) in @entity4 , used by the @entity9 and @entity108 during @entity34 in late 1942 and early 1943 , he recruited almost a thousand workers for the construction and testing of the mobile harbours			1
the project was so secret that even the men working on it were unaware of its true purpose			0
@entity98 devised two types of device , codenamed ' @entity184 ' ( concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads ) and ' @entity187 ' ( steel roadways linking them together )			0
these were subsequently towed to another secret test site in south - west @entity208			2
there , @entity98 ’ efforts were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams			0
the work at @entity216 , @entity217 in @entity208 included development and testing of breakwaters , the idea for which came from engineer @entity221			0
he had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel , on the other side the waters were calm			0
the @entity11 harbours were completed by may 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after			1
they were , as @entity24 later wrote , ' to form a principal part of the great plan ' .			0

large chunks of @entity11 have been found by @entity9 scientists
3d images show it remains despite being battered by @entity13 since 1944
for six months after @entity241 became the world 's busiest port
it is *widely* considered one of the greatest - ever engineering feats
