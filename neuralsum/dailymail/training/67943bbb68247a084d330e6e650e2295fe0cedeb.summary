the @entity2 football season 's annual curtain - raiser takes place on tuesday night when @entity4 meet @entity5 in the @entity6 in @entity7			1
though a friendly in all but name , it is a chance for the two sides to lay down a marker ahead of the new campaign			0
here 's all you need to know about the @entity6 showdown in the @entity18 capital			2
what is the @entity6 ? the annual match is organised by @entity6 as a sort of starting pistol for the new @entity2 season and is between the winners of the previous season 's @entity25 and @entity27			1
so on this occasion , it 's @entity4 , who beat their city rivals @entity31 4 - 1 in @entity32 back in may , taking on @entity5 , who defeated @entity34 on penalties in @entity36			1
this year 's @entity6 will be held at the 33,000 - capacity @entity48 , which is , as you might have guessed , the home of @entity53 side @entity52			1
it is also the venue for most @entity57 football internationals			0
getting ready : the @entity48 is preparing to welcome @entity4 and @entity5 for the @entity6 hang on , is n't this match usually played in @entity60 ? it was , yes , at the @entity62 between 1998 and 2012			1
but @entity6 decided to take the competition on the road and , rather like the finals of the @entity25 and the @entity27 , it will have a different host city each year			1
last year , the venue was the @entity69 in @entity70 as @entity71 beat @entity72 on penalties after a 2 - 2 draw			2
and next year it 's heading to @entity76 , @entity77			0
holders : @entity71 beat @entity72 on penalties to win last year 's @entity6 in @entity70 i remember the match being later in august - has it moved ? it has moved , about two weeks forward in the calendar			1
it was on august 30 last season and was usually held on the last friday in the month alongside the group stage draws for the @entity2 competitions , but with @entity88 deciding to abolish the august international friendlies , it made sense to bring it forward to the empty slot			0
the problem with holding it on a friday night at the end of august was that the domestic leagues have usually started and the two participants had to re-arrange a league game to make room			0
the move alleviates this concern			0
is there much interest in the match ? well , according to the front cover of monday 's @entity107 newspaper , 8,000 @entity45 fans are heading over to @entity7			1
there does seem to be plenty of local interest as well , with the @entity52 website saying over the weekend that only a limited number of restricted view tickets were available			0
tickets have sold well despite pretty expensive price categories of £ 110 , £ 75 and £ 40			0
invasion : 8,000 @entity45 fans are expected in the @entity18 capital , according to newspaper as i ca n't get to @entity7 ... is it on the tv ? yes			2
you have a choice of watching it on @entity125 ( coverage starts at 7.30pm for a 7.45pm kick - off ) or the newly - launched @entity128 5			0
who 's the man in the middle ? @entity133 's @entity132 is set to take charge			0
it will be the first match in a @entity6 club competition to use the vanishing spray that proved so popular at the @entity138			2
man in the middle : @entity133 's @entity132 will take charge of the @entity2 curtain - raiser have the teams played in the @entity6 before ? they have			1
@entity4 lifted the trophy in 2002 , when they beat @entity27 holders @entity145 3 - 1 in @entity60			1
they have also lost two finals , to @entity148 holders @entity72 in 1998 and @entity149 in 2000			0
@entity5 beat @entity150 3 - 0 to win the @entity6 in 2006 but they lost 3 - 1 to @entity151 on their return visit the following year			1
sole success : @entity4 lifted the @entity6 for the one and only time when they beat @entity145 in 2002 what are they playing for ? the @entity6 trophy has had various guises over the years and the latest silver one looks pretty sleek and modern			1
it is 58cm high and weights in at 12.2kg			0
@entity5 's @entity161 was the first to lift the new version back in august 2006			2
the trophy has been sight - seeing this last week along with its siblings the @entity25 and the @entity27 trophy - they were all carried up to the summit of @entity167 by two die - hard football fans			1
they have also been on display in @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity7 on the roadshow			2
what a view ! the @entity6 trophy has scaled @entity57 's highest peak , @entity167 , this week trio : and the @entity6 was accompanied to the summit by the @entity25 and @entity27 cups who 's in charge ? @entity183 joined @entity184 in football posterity when he won his third @entity25 back in may , the success in @entity32 added to two triumphs when at @entity151			1
he had arrived at the @entity188 from @entity189 the previous summer and , although they could n't keep up with neighbours @entity31 in the league , they exacted their revenge in the @entity2 final			2
@entity4 also won the @entity194 , beating @entity150 thanks to @entity196 's sensational solo goal , to endear @entity183 even more to the fans			1
@entity198 predicts big season for @entity196 hat - trick : @entity183 won his third @entity25 when @entity4 beat @entity31 in the final quick success : @entity203 has guided @entity5 to fifth in @entity204 and @entity27 glory @entity203 replaced @entity206 at the helm in january 2013 and led @entity5 to a fifth place finish in his first full season as well as the @entity27			1
it is the third time @entity5 have won the competition , all of those coming in the last eight years			2
who 's going to be on display ? the fans in @entity7 will be among the first to see @entity4 's latest crop of @entity216 in action			1
with £ 70m @entity218 sensation @entity37 and £ 20m @entity220 midfield master @entity219 joining @entity221 , @entity196 and @entity222 , @entity4 will undoubtedly have the most feared forward line in @entity2 in the coming season			1
hot shot : @entity37 posing this week with the @entity227 award won for scoring six times for @entity229 at the @entity138 finals in @entity231 homecoming : @entity196 is set to play for @entity4 in his home city of @entity7 it is a homecoming for @entity196 , who scored in the @entity25 final , as he was brought up in the city , attended @entity236 and started out with @entity237			1
@entity5 's team will be worth a fraction of @entity4 's , and they sold @entity241 midfielder @entity240 to @entity150 in june , but they could still trouble their more illustrious opponents			1
to mark the launch of their new @entity2 football channel , @entity128 have unleashed a giant football at the @entity48			2
