by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 07:07 est , 8 december 2012 @entity2 intelligence officers are investigating the assassination of a @entity5 engineer and his family in the @entity7 , including his links to @entity9 and an alleged fortune in cash hidden in a @entity13 bank account			1
@entity14 , 50 , wife @entity15 , 47 , and her mother @entity16 , 74 , were gunned down in their car execution - style while seemingly taking a camping holiday in the @entity7			1
oldest daughter @entity19 , seven , was shot in the shoulder , while @entity21 , four , only survived by hiding underneath her mother ’s skirt in the back of the family 's @entity26 estate car			2
@entity14 ( left ) , was murdered in a suspected assassination while on holiday with his family in @entity32			2
@entity2 police are now investigating his links to former @entity2 president @entity9 ( right ) pictured in 1991 @entity36 : mr @entity37 returned to @entity2 in 2010 , when he was allegedly badly beaten up but as yet investigations have drawn a blank prompting the @entity7 team to travel to @entity2 to hand dozens of pages on mr @entity37 to local intelligence officers in the hope they can uncover a motive for the killings			1
mr @entity37 returned to @entity2 in 2010 , ostensibly to take control of the family home and a poultry business they managed before leaving the country in the late 1960s			1
but during his time there he was allegedly badly beaten up and was said to have returned to the @entity5 traumatised from the experience			1
then there is also the question of an estimated £ 800,000 left by @entity58 ’s father @entity57 in a @entity13 bank account			1
there have been reports that his late father , @entity57 , was once close to @entity9 's @entity63 but fell foul of the tyrant in the @entity66 , and fled @entity2 for @entity5			0
alternatively , it has been suggested this was a smokescreen and that @entity57 's true role was to manage secret accounts for the regime			0
emails and mobile phone calls intercepted by @entity13 intelligence agency @entity75 and passed to their @entity77 counterparts suggest that @entity14 may have been about to access the money , or part of it , shortly before he was killed			1
@entity81 , where the family were staying is a short drive to the @entity13 border and over to @entity85			2
aerial photo of the car at the murder scene in the forrest near @entity90 and @entity81 in the @entity7 @entity7 another account , said to contain some £ 16 million in illegal kickbacks to @entity9 's regime , was set up in the tax haven of @entity95			1
this was one of dozens of accounts the @entity9 regime used to hide money illegally skkimmed from the @entity102 programme			0
while sketchy , the claims raise questions about whether the killers knew or suspected mr @entity106 had access to large deposits of cash			0
a source told the @entity112 : ' for this murder to take place just over the @entity13 border , so close to where that money rested untouched for so many years , can not be disregarded as a strange coincidence , ” the inquiry source continued			2
' in total there are more than 2,000 dossiers to study , many focussing on the family ’s @entity2 background			0
' that is why this is such an extraordinarily complex case and why it could take years of careful police work to solve it			0
' an earlier theory maintained that the cyclist mr @entity129 , 45 , was in fact the intended target due to his job at a metal plant supplying materials to the nuclear fuel industry there had been some speculation that the @entity139 secret service @entity138 believed mr @entity129 could have been selling nuclear secrets and was monitoring his emails			0
another theory is that the killings were the work of a racist psychopath who had targetted the family at random .			0
