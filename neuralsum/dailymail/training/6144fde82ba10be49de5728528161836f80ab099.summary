the bunker in which @entity1 married @entity2 shortly before the couple committed suicide is being re-created by a @entity6 museum despite fears it may be deemed insensitive			2
a replica of the @entity10 , where @entity11 leader @entity1 spent his final months in @entity13 , is being planned for a summer opening at the ' @entity16 ' museum in @entity17 , in the @entity19 valley more than 300 miles from its original location			1
' we 're just in the planning stages â€“ the architects are working on it , ' museum director @entity21 told thelocal.de			1
we want to recreate it to show people			0
' @entity21 added : ' we are doing so very carefully and with sensitivity			2
' the museum is being careful not to create a place of pilgrimage for the few who still identify with the ideology of @entity48 in their rebirth of the bunker that was originally at @entity51 and @entity52 in @entity13			1
empty black frames will hang on the walls of the bunker instead of the portraits of @entity1 that were in the original to make the bunker an educational piece and avoid it being considered any sort of tribute			0
the @entity10 in @entity13 was where @entity1 married @entity2 ( below ) before they committed suicide @entity2 , who died @entity2 , was the long - time companion of @entity11 leader @entity1 until their death a carpark marks the spot where @entity1 ended his own life as his @entity11 regime collapsed an unadorned plaque was erected in 2006 , but it 's policy in @entity6 to make @entity11 landmarks as dull as possible so not to make them attractive destination for those who identify with @entity1 's policy ' we certainly do n't want to recreate a place for the misguided people who still see him as a hero to come as a pilgrimage			1
we are planning against that , ' @entity21 said			0
the re-created complex will include the @entity11 leader 's rooms , his secretary 's office , the radio room and the clinic occupied by @entity1 's personal physician , dr @entity92			2
plans will be based on floor plans from the @entity95 , along with historical pictures and documentation			0
general @entity98 , who led @entity11 forces in their losing defence of @entity13 against @entity102 force , leaves the bunker a @entity105 officers cap with its trademark death skull on the floor next to a cupboard in the @entity10 a bullet - riddled pillbox watchtower outside the bunker empty gas jerrycans used by @entity113 when ordered to burn the bodies of @entity1 and @entity2 when the original bunker was stormed by @entity118 forces in 1945 , after @entity1 had moved there to use it as his base of command for @entity6 troops at the start of the year , it represented the fall of the @entity11			1
it was blown up in 1947 and now the site houses a car park			0
the only sign of its existence is a plaque showing the layout and some historical facts that was placed there in 2006 before the @entity136			0
@entity16 has previously courted controversy when they rebuilt the house @entity140 's hiding place from which @entity142 forces pulled him out of in 2011 .			1

the @entity10 was at @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity13
the complex will be recreated by the @entity16 museum in @entity17
