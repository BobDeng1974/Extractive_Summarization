the chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage is at its lowest since the 1970s , figures reveal			1
the number who become victims of the ‘ seven - year itch ’ and end their marriage at that point has dropped by a fifth in the past 15 years alone			1
the fall in divorce among couples married for a decade or less is largely behind the overall increase in the stability of marriage , the figures from the @entity11 suggest			1
happily ever after : the chance of couples divorcing in the early years of their marriage has fallen to its lowest since the 1970s , new marriage breakdown figures have shown reasons : men now mainly marry out of choice - rather than the family pressure which often used to push many into a wedding - and so are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives , researchers believe analysts say the popularity of living together has meant that men who eventually decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families than their fathers were			1
they now mainly marry out of choice – rather than as a result of the family pressure that pushed many into marriage in the past			2
this means they are much less likely to stray or to neglect their wives , researchers believe			0
the figures also revealed that divorces are now less likely to be initiated by wives			0
the first decade of marriage is the toughest for most couples , with break - ups most likely in this period			2
the chances of staying together rise sharply after the 10th anniversary			0
however , the latest figures show the divorce rate gradually dropping for couples in those most challenging first years together			1
the chance of a couple who married in 2005 divorcing by 2012 is now 14 per cent , down from 17 per cent for those who wed in the late 1980s and much of the 1990s			1
risk : couples are most likely to break up in the first decade of their marriage , and their chances of staying together rise sharply after the 10th anniversary the seven - year - itch break - up rate , which rose fast after the liberalisation of divorce laws in the early 1970s , was last at 14 per cent between 1978 and 1981			1
a couple who married in 2005 were around a fifth less likely to divorce by 2012 than those whose weddings were in 1991 , the peak year for divorce			1
however , the @entity11 figures do not include marriages that take place abroad – for example , on holidays – and some analysts calculate that if these were taken into account , couples are now a quarter less likely to part within seven years			1
the number of wives petitioning for divorce has fallen by more than a third since the early 1990s , according to the @entity11			2
in 2012 , women initiated 76,490 divorces , down from more than 106,000 as recently as 2003			0
by contrast , the number of divorces stemming from petitions by husbands has remained at between 40,000 and 45,000 a year since 1980			0
some researchers believe the change has happened because women are much less likely to find themselves betrayed or abandoned by their husbands			0
living together : analysts say the popularity of cohabitation has meant that men in particular who do finally decide to marry are much more committed to their wives and families than their fathers were @entity96 , of the @entity97 , said : ‘ as cohabitation has become more and more accepted over the past 20 years , family pressure on men to get married has reduced			1
‘ couples are no longer being told they must do the right thing			0
as a result , the couples who decide to marry are the most committed			0
’ he added : ‘ the decision to buy into a marriage is very important for men			2
men are more committed to their marriage and wives are happier			2
you can see this in the rates at which wives and husbands are petitioning for divorce			0
‘ there is a long - term decline in divorces started by wives , while the rate for husbands is absolutely flat			0
’ @entity11 analysts also suggest that the increase in couples living together before marriage in recent years may be a factor in declining divorce			1
‘ cohabitation is often a precursor to marriage and may act to filter out weaker relationships from progressing to marriage , ’ a report says			2
couples getting married when they are older may be also be a factor			0
‘ the age at first marriage has been increasing , and previous research has shown that those marrying at older ages have a lower risk of divorce , ’ the report says .			0

those who end their marriage after seven years drops by a fifth in the past 15 years , according to the @entity11
rise in cohabitation means men are more likely to commit , say analysts
a couple who wed in 2005 are around a fifth less likely to divorce by 2012 than couples whose weddings were in 1991
