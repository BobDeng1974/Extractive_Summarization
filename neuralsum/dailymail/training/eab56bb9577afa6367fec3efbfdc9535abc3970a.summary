pope @entity0 has suggested that the @entity1 could support gay civil unions in the future , according to one of the church ’s most senior cardinals			1
cardinal @entity7 said that the pontiff wants the @entity9 to study same - sex unions , ‘ rather than condemn them ’			1
@entity7 told @entity13 television that @entity0 wants church leaders to ' look into it and see the reasons that have driven them			1
' he said , “ rather than quickly condemn them , let 's just ask the questions as to why that has appealed to certain people			0
” ’ in an interview to mark his first year in the church ’s top job , @entity0 last week reaffirmed the @entity20 ’s opposition to gay marriage but indicated that some types of civil unions could be acceptable to the church			1
the @entity0 restated the church 's teaching that ' marriage is between a man and a woman , ' but added ' we have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety			1
' @entity7 , pictured here with @entity54 in @entity55 in 2012 , told @entity13 television that @entity0 wants church leaders to ' look into same sex unions and see the reasons that have driven them ' pope @entity0 will make his first trip to @entity62 in august , visiting @entity63 to participate in a @entity9 youth festival , preside over a beatification ceremony for 124 @entity67 martyrs and bring a message of peace to the war - divided peninsula , officials said			1
the august 14 - 18 trip announced monday by the @entity1 will be @entity0 ' second foreign visit this year after his brief visit to @entity75 , @entity76 and the @entity78 territories in may			1
@entity0 told reporters last summer en route home from his first foreign trip to @entity82 that he wanted to go to @entity62 because pope @entity83 never managed to get to the continent , aside from a quick trip to @entity86 in 2006			2
the visit will mark the first time in 25 years that a pope has visited the @entity90			0
pope @entity91 last visited in 1989 and he canonized 103 @entity67 martyrs during a 1984 trip			0
@entity0 last month cleared 124 other @entity67 martyrs for beatification and is expected to preside over the ceremony himself during the trip , @entity63 's @entity98 and the @entity1 - affiliated missionary news agency @entity100 reported			1
@entity101 quoted bishop @entity102 , president of the @entity103 , as saying the visit will also help bring peace to the peninsula			0
the two @entity107 have been in a near - constant standoff since an armistice ended the @entity110 in 1953			0
‘ i think his choice of the divided @entity90 as the destination of his first @entity62 trip came out of his aspiration for peace on the peninsula and the rest of the world and his hope to pray together with @entity62 youths , ’ @entity111 said , according to @entity98			0
some countries justify civil unions as a way to provide the same economic and legal rights to cohabitating couples as those who are married , the @entity0 said in the interview with @entity132 newspaper @entity131			1
as archbishop of @entity134 , the then @entity135 was one of the leaders of the @entity9 's public charge against legalising same - sex marriage in @entity139			1
he called the proposed legislation ‘ a destructive attack on @entity142 ’			0
but behind closed doors the @entity139 archbishop is said to have supported civil unions for same - sex couples			1
former theology professor and gay rights activist @entity147 said : ' he told me “ i 'm in favour of gay rights and in any case , i also favour civil unions for homosexuals , but i believe that @entity139 is not yet ready for a gay marriage law ”			0
’ but @entity0 ’ comments are the first time that a @entity0 has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions , according to @entity1 watchers			2
archbishop @entity7 said his own view was that gay unions could ' water down ' the symbolic meaning of traditional marriage			2
' it 's not something that 's just a religious , sacramental concern , ' @entity7 said			2
' it 's also the building block of society and culture			0
so it belongs to culture			0
and if we water down that sacred meaning of marriage in any way , i worry that not only the church would suffer , i worry that culture and society would			0
' since being elected @entity0 last year @entity0 has softened the tone coming out of @entity180			2
he told journalists that he would not ' judge ' gays and lesbians including gay priests saying , ' if a person is gay and seeks @entity187 and has good will , who am i to judge ? ' in recognition for the perceived change in stance @entity0 appeared on the cover of gay magazine @entity195 as their person of the year .			0
