@entity1 's crown princess mary might have wowed in a succession of evening gowns last week but sunday was all about low - key family time for the @entity6 - born royal			1
@entity0 , 43 , treated her three youngest children , @entity8 , seven , and twins @entity9 and prince @entity11 , four , to a day out at a farm in @entity13 , a village in @entity15			1
making the most of the sunny weather , the quartet certainly appeared to be having fun , with all four crouching down to pet a tiny @entity21 calf			0
the three children , meanwhile , were well - wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns , with prince @entity11 even climbing a fence to get a better look			0
but not everyone fancied a day out at the farm , with @entity0 left without her husband @entity40 , 46 , and eldest son @entity41 , nine , for the outing			1
the visit , which was part of @entity1 's annual @entity45 celebrations , came days after royals from around @entity47 descended on @entity48 for @entity50 's 75th birthday celebrations			0
having a cuddle : the family met the calf during a visit to a farm in the village of @entity13 going green : the moment came during @entity45 , an annual event in @entity1 now my turn : @entity0 's youngest son , prince @entity11 , four , approaches the calf for a cuddle slow down ! @entity0 holds tight to prince @entity11 after the active four - year - old scaled a fence for a better look kicking off with a glitzy gala dinner last wednesday night , festivities continued with a balcony appearance and parade through the @entity1 capital the following day			1
@entity0 , who wowed in a striking lilac gown embellished with silver beadwork on the first night , was seated beside her mother - in - law during the procession up shopping street @entity78			0
she also appeared on the balcony of the @entity80 alongside her husband and children and was there once again for the celebration 's climax - a spectacular party at @entity87			0
although she had stiff competition from the equally glamorous crown princess victoria of sweden , 37 , and @entity92 's crown princess @entity91 , 41 , the @entity6 - born royal ensured all eyes were on her courtesy of a shimmering silver gown			2
still climbing : prince @entity11 watches the action from his perch half way up a gate country skills : the @entity91 and her children also tried their hand at milking , albeit not on a real cow no photos ! princess @entity9 pulls a face at photographers , watched by her mother surrounded : the family inspects the herd of @entity21 dairy cows kept at the farm			2
