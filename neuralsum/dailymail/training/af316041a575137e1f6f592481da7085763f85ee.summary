by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 01:45 est , 13 june 2013 this terraced family home is believed to be the cheapest in the @entity3 - and it could be sold for as little as 10p			0
the three - bedroom house in @entity5 , @entity6 , has a guide price of just £ 750 , and yet is ready to move in to straight away with a working bathroom and kitchen			1
as it has no reserve price , the property in @entity11 could go for no more than a few pence when it is auctioned off tonight			1
on sale : the house with the green door in this image could be sold for as little as 10p tonight neighbourhood : the house is in @entity5 , @entity6 , a post-industrial town near @entity19 a number of other homes have previously been dubbed @entity3 's cheapest , but most have not actually been inhabitable without a total renovation			1
however , while the buyer of this house can move in immediately , he or she will have to do a certain amount of work - the windows have been boarded up and the garden is totally overgrown			1
experts say that after renovation the property , situated in a deprived area of the port town , could be worth more than £ 25,000			0
the home consists of an entrance hall , three bedrooms , family bathroom and a large lounge			0
decent shape : the home could do with a lick of paint , but is hardly looking delapidated kitchen : it may be missing some utilities , but there are the facilities to cook up a simple family meal sparse : the new owner will have some work to do to stamp his or her personality on the property ' this is a total bargain , ' said @entity59 of auctioneer iam - sold			2
' i am not aware of any properties in the @entity3 that have a lower guide price than this			0
' as it has no reserve , technically the house could sell for as little as a few pounds			1
' it does n't even need much work , i have been told that a few thousand would be sufficient to get it up to scratch			0
bathroom : the washing facilities certainly belie the £ 750 guide price for the terraced home well - lit : but it remains to be seen how popular the property will prove at auction bargain ? although the property certainly needs a lot of work , it is inhabitable straight away ' the owner is keen for a quick sale but we are hoping that when it goes under the hammer , bidders will bring in a decent price			1
' potentially it could make a nice family home			0
it 's not the best area , but we have had interest from people hoping to move in straight away , those who would like to rent it out , and some who hope to renovate it and make a profit			2
' last october , two other @entity5 homes sold for a combined total of less than £ 25,000			2
both three - bedroom properties were located on @entity11 , and went for £ 14,000 and £ 10,500			1
cheap move : the one - bedroom flat in @entity105 , @entity106 with an auction price of just £ 2,500 a two - bedroom home in @entity110 , @entity108 was labelled the cheapest house in @entity3 in april , on sale with a starting price of just £ 1,000			1
the property was so dilapidated that it would have taken thousands of pounds to make it liveable			0
estate agents marketing the house admitted the home was ' in need of complete refurbishment '			0
another of @entity3 's cheapest homes went to auction in february with a starting price of just £ 2,500 ( right )			2
estate agents admitted the one - bedroom flat in @entity105 , @entity106 , was in a ' distressed ' state , but said the first - floor apartment could make an ideal first home with lots of @entity131			1
and a three - bedroom house that went on sale in @entity134 was given a starting price of just £ 750 when it went under the hammer last october			1
the semi-detached home featured a lounge , entrance hall , family bathroom and a front and rear garden			0
although situated in a troubled area of the town , it was described as an ‘ ideal investment ’			0
earlier this week , an even cheaper house appeared on the market - auctioneers listed a home in the old mining village on @entity151 , @entity152 for free			2
however , that property hardly counts as a home - the sellers admitted it was ' unfit for human habitation ' and described it as ' little more than a shell requiring complete renovation ' .			0

three - bedroom house in @entity5 goes under the hammer for £ 750
but it has no reserve price *meaning* it could sell for as little as a few pence
despite delapidated state it is available to move in to straight away
