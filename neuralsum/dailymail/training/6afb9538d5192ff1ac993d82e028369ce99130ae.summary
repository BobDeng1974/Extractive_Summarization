' anyone who does not love the country , love @entity1 or is confrontational towards the central government shall not be the chief executive , ' he said			0
the activists want universal suffrage , but @entity65 rulers in @entity6 say any candidate for the territory 's chief executive has to be approved by a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with @entity71 loyalists			1
activists from a movement called @entity49 have threatened to blockade @entity1 's financial district unless @entity6 grants full democracy , setting the stage for disruptive protests in coming weeks			1

the issue of democracy has been a constant source of friction between @entity1 's pro-democracy movement and the mainland since the former @entity9 colony was handed back to @entity65 rulers in 1997			2
@entity160 , @entity1 's last colonial governor who oversaw the transition , was widely hailed as the chief architect of sweeping improvements to the region 's equality laws			2

it included its own legal system , freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - liberties not enjoyed on the mainland			0

but their hopes were dashed on sunday when the standing committee of the @entity15 announced citizens will only be able to vote from a list of two or three candidates who have obtained the backing of a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with @entity71 loyalists			2
