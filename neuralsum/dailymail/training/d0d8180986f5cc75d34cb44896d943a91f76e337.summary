sex is the top topic on voyeuristic site @entity3 , where subscribers post anonymous diary entries online imagine you sit down in a coffee shop and notice a private handwritten journal left abandoned on the table			1
would you be able to control your temptation to open it ? or would your curiosity get the better of you ? if you ’d look away like a good citizen , you ’re in the minority			2
a recent experiment that created this exact scenario found one in five people surreptitiously picked up the journal and read through the very private entries – which included details of sex fantasies and loss of a parent			1
the experiment , which was carried out by anonymous social media site @entity27 , found that 60 % picked up the journal and read it , 77 % of whom were women			1
only 30 % of people turned a blind eye and a mere 10 % handed it in			1
the experiment illustrates why @entity32 , which allows subscribers to post 200 - word diary entries without revealing their identity , is proving a big hit with us nosy brits			1
the voyeuristic site has racked up over half a million page views with more than 3,000 subscribers creating online diaries in which users share their deepest , darkest and often most embarrassing secrets			1
every day , the writer can upload 200 words to tell their story			2
they can also pin relevant websites to each journal entry , store pictures appropriate to their stories and upload songs or videos that remind them of the times they are writing about			2
but most importantly , subscribers can write about whatever they want - from their affair with the boss to the friend they secretly despise - without anyone discovering their true identity			1
usernames and emails are private to everyone , including the website ’s staff			1
@entity72 also often ask advice from their unknown followers about what to do or how to cope in situations			2
there are now 23,000 real - life diary entries on the site , which has been dubbed the ‘ anti-social network ’			1
unlike @entity81 , where users attempt to portray themselves in the best possible light , @entity32 is a platform for sharing the unadulterated truth			2
a recent poll found that 33 % of social media users admitted to dishonesty , with a quarter ( 24 % ) of women stating they lie or exaggerate on social media between 1 - 3 times per month , 7 % between 3 - 6 times and a staggeringly untruthful 1 % more than 25 times			1
on @entity27 subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown the most common topic respondents lied or exaggerated about was what they were doing ( 29 % ) , for example , pretending they were doing something exciting when in fact they were home alone			1
just under a quarter of respondents ( 24 % ) said they lied about how much they drink			1
one in five fibbed about what they were up to on holiday and about their career			2
and a cheeky 17 % lied about their relationship status			1
so why all the smoke and mirrors ? the survey found that the top reasons for lying were : ‘ i worry people see me as boring ’ ; ‘ i feel jealous of other people ’s exciting posts ’ ; ‘ i do n’t have anything to say otherwise ’ and ‘ i want to impress someone / everyone ’			1
on refreshingly honest @entity32 , however , no such life airbrushing occurs			2
one entry about a casual liaison reads : ‘ condom malfunction stopped the activity as soon as we realised but not quite soon enough			2
’ not exactly the sort of details posted on @entity81			0
another frank entry reads : ‘ i wish after everything i could be happy with myself			0
but with my ex having driven me crazy , secretly going after my sister throughout the one and half years we were together , it 's made me feel fat , ugly , insecure and stupid			1
’ if @entity81 makes you feel you have to compete in the perfect life competition you never chose to enter , @entity32 might just be that dose of unadulterated reality you 've been waiting for			0
@entity143 : waiting for a life extract 1 : something strange is going on as you know , @entity147 ( my ex ) came and stayed with me a few days whilst @entity150 was away			0
it was so good to spend time with @entity147			0
it reminded me why i loved him and what we once had together and for a millisecond i was transported back to those days and was wondering why we split up - but i soon came to			0
the @entity159 homepage is bursting with secrets waiting to be read it seems , however , that @entity147 stayed in that dream state			1
he rang today and left a message saying he very much likes mr @entity164 but that if i ever felt			0
i was shocked and super angry			0
what on earth does he think he 's up to ? telling me that i am even more beautiful than before , that i am a lady and have a " real sophistication " does n't mean i am going to go running to him			1
sure , he has money galore , looks that stop women in the street , manners of a true gentleman and tastes in culture that make me want to swoon but then there 's mr @entity178 extract 2 : waiting for a life i woke up this morning with dread in my mind			2
it is such an awful feeling			0
it is worse than a panic attack ( for me ) because it is all consuming and lasts for weeks sometimes			0
i know what it is about and have looked for help to shake it off but no one seems to be able to help			0
even meditation does n't help			0
it is all about the fact that i feel like i am an empty shell , that i have lived my life in fast forward , that it has been so packed up with experiences that now it has come to a stand still			0
my childhood has consumed ' me ' and there is no way to escape the issue that i have nothing , nothing , to look forward to			0
oh sure i have the odd bit and bob but there is nothing that will change my life , turn it on its head , and i seem to need that			0
i know i should be content with what i have but i feel ...			0
. i do n't know			0
words do n't cover it .			0
