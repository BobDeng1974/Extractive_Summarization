just a few weeks ago , @entity0 were the most dazzling side in @entity2 as they chased @entity4 and @entity5 glory			1
now , they find themselves in a crisis with boss @entity11 under fire , record signing @entity6 booed by his own fans and @entity14 taking a vow of silence			1
here , @entity18 - based reporter @entity17 runs through just what has gone wrong at the @entity20 after tuesday night 's 4 - 3 defeat at home by @entity23			1
@entity6 was subjected to boos from @entity0 fans as they were beaten at home by @entity23 @entity14 celebrates after scoring , but he could n't prevent his side slumping to a 4 - 3 defeat @entity11 , pictured hugging @entity23 boss @entity30 , is under growing pressure at the @entity20 it seems that all is not well at the @entity34 ... you could say that			1
in fact , you could say a lot worse , and the @entity18 newspapers have			0
' what horror ! ' screamed the front page of @entity42			0
' the odds of being eliminated by @entity23 were comparable to those of being killed by a piano , ' said as , after @entity0 scraped into the @entity4 quarter finals			1
the @entity48 papers were no kinder			0
' a pitiful @entity0 ! ' spat the front page of @entity51 , while @entity52 labelled @entity11 's side ' ridiculous '			1
so , what 's the problem ? where do you start ? @entity11 's expensive cruise liner is full of holes and the water is flooding in , just at the wrong time			1
goalkeeper @entity62 , for one , was at fault for three of the four goals @entity0 conceded			1
by the way , the last time they shipped four at the @entity20 in the @entity4 was 15 years ago , against @entity68			1
virtually the only thing @entity62 stopped on tuesday night was players like @entity14 from leaving the pitch without applauding the fans			1
@entity62 failed to keep hold of @entity75 's shot which led to @entity77 - @entity76 giving @entity23 the lead @entity6 , @entity79 and @entity14 look frustrated as @entity0 were booed off the field surely it is time to play @entity82 then ? it 's not that simple			1
@entity84 started a war within the club with his treatment of the legendary @entity62			0
while it 's plain to see that the @entity18 stopper has been far below his best level for a long time , displacing him could cause more trouble than it 's worth			0
@entity11 reinstated him and the tension at the club has since simmered down			1
he will have to think long and hard about whether he wants to start a new battle			0
@entity62 was described as a ' celebrity ' rather than a goalkeeper by @entity42 's @entity98 , but the fact remains that he 's the team 's captain and has a big influence at the club			0
@entity62 has been below his best for some time , but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds @entity62 called on his @entity0 team - mates acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat a group of @entity0 fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle following a disappointing result why did @entity62 have to force @entity14 to stay on the pitch ? @entity14 is not having a happy time right now			1
ever since he was berated for celebrating his 30th birthday on the evening of @entity0 's embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat by rivals @entity115 , he 's been in a strop			1
despite leading @entity118 in the @entity119 ( golden boot ) by 13 goals during mid-december , the pair are now level on 30 goals each in @entity5			1
after winning the @entity124 in january , his productivity levels have dropped considerably			0
@entity14 netted twice against @entity23 , and both times he celebrated with fury , rather than joy , as if he was proving a point			1
@entity14 scored a double against @entity23 , but his relationship with the @entity0 supporters is strained the world player of the year has grown frustrated at the lack of support from the @entity0 supporters what ’s got @entity14 ’s goat ? a recent poll in @entity138 suggested 30 per cent of @entity0 fans wanted to see him dropped - he probably does n't think he has anything to thank them for			1
the whistles screaming around the @entity20 at full time would have angered @entity14 particularly , given his contribution to the @entity146 cause over the past six years			2
after the game he angrily declared that he would n't be speaking to the press until the end of the season			0
the @entity18 media were deeply critical of @entity0 in wednesday morning 's newspapers @entity42 and @entity138 both opted for striking headlines following @entity0 's defeat at the hands of @entity23 @entity6 looked tired against @entity23 what about his partner in crime , @entity6 ? the past few weeks have been terrible for the @entity160			1
after last season 's heroics in the @entity164 and @entity4 finals , @entity6 was expected to continue his development and become a @entity20 hero			1
instead , he 's more often the scapegoat			0
after the controversy where he shot instead of passing to @entity14 and @entity169 , he was labelled selfish and castigated in the @entity18 media			2
since then , he 's been far more reluctant to shoot			0
that 's manifested itself in his recent productivity ; he has no goals and no assists in eight matches			0
that 's a long time to go without contributing as a forward for any side , let alone @entity0 ... yes , it 's quite astonishing really			2
for the most expensive player in football history , in a top team , to fail to contribute anything in that spell , is a surprise			0
he 's played every minute of those eight games , and only in @entity0 's 2 - 0 win over @entity189 on february 14 , could he say that he put in a good performance			1
is he tired ? he looked exhausted against @entity23 ? that could be the case			2
@entity11 has largely refused to rotate his side , particularly the strikers			2
the @entity195 described the ' @entity197 ' attack as ' unnegotiable '			0
that 's a terrible message to send to both the attacking trident , and players like @entity201 and @entity202 , who are fighting for a place in the team			0
if @entity6 , @entity14 and @entity169 will start every game , regardless of performance , it 's not going to motivate them or their underlings to produce good displays			1
it ’s understandable that a player like @entity6 , who relies on his explosive pace , is feeling the strain			2
@entity0 went to the @entity215 to play friendlies in the summer , and then @entity217 for the @entity218 , all of which takes its toll			2
@entity11 's future at @entity0 is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th @entity4 so , is this all @entity11 's fault ? well , he 's the one that 's under pressure now			1
he 's being asked about his future at @entity0 , which seems a little unfair given he finally landed them @entity229 - the club 's 10th @entity4 - last season			1
however , he 's not helping his own cause with some of his comments			0
' we 've played so badly that it is difficult to explain , ' he said after the @entity23 game			2
unfortunately , @entity11 , it is your job to not just explain , but also fix the damage			2
the white handkerchiefs were out ... it 's a traditional sign of discontent among supporters in @entity18 , adopted in football from bullfighting			0
in that ' sport ' it 's seen as a positive thing , with spectators waving handkerchiefs to encourage the president of the fight to award the fighter a part of the bull ( e.g. an ear , or a tail ) as a reward for a good performance			0
occasionally handkerchiefs can be waved to show support in football , after a great performance , but that was certainly not the case against @entity23			2
it 's not unique to @entity0 , but they are the team you associate it most with			2
the fans are , shall we say , high - maintenance			0
this is good for @entity48 then , who have overtaken @entity0 in the league , heading into @entity274 next sunday ? very good			2
@entity276 ’s men are flying , reaping the rewards from a sensible summer schedule and the rotation which the coach was criticised for at the start of the season			0
@entity284 ’s enforced rest means he ’s finding his best form at the opportune moment , as @entity287 found out a few weeks ago			0
so @entity48 will beat @entity0 in @entity274 and win @entity5 ? it ’s not that simple			1
@entity0 did n’t become a giant of world football by rolling over and having their bellies tickled by their bitter rivals			0
@entity293 made his return on tuesday night and he ’s a key part of the team , so during the past three months they ’ve sorely missed him			0
@entity297 has been injured , too , along with @entity298			0
while the latter wo n’t make @entity274 , @entity297 and @entity293 should play , and that will help @entity0 regain some balance and poise .			0

@entity0 were dazzling @entity2 as they chased @entity4 and @entity5 glory
but a 4 - 3 defeat at the hands of @entity23 on tuesday is their latest *setback*
@entity14 appears *unhappy* while @entity6 is being subjected to taunts from his own supporters and @entity11 is under pressure
