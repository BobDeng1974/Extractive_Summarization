he said : ‘ i ’m very clear , the time is right for women bishops , it was right many years ago , they need to get on with it as it were and get with the programme , but you do have to respect the individual institutions and the way they work , while giving them a sharp prod			0
we can not allow this to drag on for another ten years			0
' it ’s simply not sustainable , it ’s not tolerable to the vast majority of @entity76 in this country and the vast majority of the @entity80 public who support women bishops and simply can not understand how this is allowed to happen			0
