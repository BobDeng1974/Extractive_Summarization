the former chairman of the @entity26 is also one of six senior figures aiding @entity4 's inquiry , whose official report is due out this month			2
meanwhile the head of the @entity6 @entity30 has quit after starting the crisis that has ripped through the @entity32			1
his name and photo has been removed from the @entity6 's website and his linked @entity37 account , which announced the disastrous @entity13 investigation to the world before it was broadcast , has been shut down			1
' an appointment of an interim editor is likely to be announced in the near @entity43 inquiry to establish the role of @entity45 in the story is in urgent progress			0
an interim report will be issued as soon as possible , ' a @entity6 spokesman said			2
' trustees reaffirm the @entity6 ’s commitment to fact - based , non-sensational investigation in the public interest			1
any role by the @entity6 or its officers in this story was strictly contrary to the fundamental principles and standards of the @entity6			2
' @entity59 has been told mr @entity30 was diagnosed with a serious and life - changing illness that led to him consuming ' potent medication ' and ‘ taking his eye off the ball ' as the investigation was put together by his staff , a source close to him said			2

' the source added that his @entity37 post was something ' he deeply regretted ' and despite mr @entity30 later erasing the message all the damage was done			0
but the source said the @entity32 , not the bureau , should blamed for taking the decision to go ahead with it			0

he was previously a commissioning executive at @entity98 and a senior producer at the @entity32			0
his staff – including reporter @entity91 – had worked with the @entity32 on the botched report which has already forced the resignation of director general @entity104			1
but it was a message mr @entity30 tweeted in which he claimed @entity13 was about to reveal ‘ a very senior political figure who is a paedophile ’ which prompted an online storm			2
although mr @entity30 did not identify @entity14 – and @entity13 chose not to – the former @entity113 chairman ’s name was soon widely linked to the investigation			1
a statement from the @entity6 said : ' the trustees are appalled at what appears to be a breach of its standards			2

the @entity6 was an offshoot of those meetings but mr @entity149 , mr @entity154 and ms @entity153 have never had any role in its inception at all or any connection to the bureau since			1
the few journalists who appear to be on permanent staff include mr @entity30 and mr @entity91 , who was once named @entity166 at the @entity167			0
scoop : @entity13 , presented by @entity168 , failed to reveal the man 's identity and the @entity32 has so far refused to comment investigations he has worked on in the past two years include an exposé on ' counterfeit pharmaceuticals , corporate killings in @entity175 , human rights abuses by the @entity178 police and @entity180 gang - land murders linked to security contracts , ' he says on his website			1

explosive : managing editor of the @entity136 - based @entity6 , @entity30 , revealed the scoop online tweeting : a message from @entity212 today ass he faces pressure to quit over his earlier online message but it attracted controversy in august over a joint investigation with @entity13 which claimed the charity @entity218 used some of its money to subsidise @entity223 building projects rather than help for injured service personnel			1
the charity claimed the report was misleading			0
the @entity228 investigation was handled by @entity6 ' lead reporter ' mr @entity91 , a former @entity32 journalist who worked on @entity229 's today programme and file on four			1
he was seconded to @entity13 to work on the abuse investigation , under the supervision of acting editor @entity234 , to preserve the @entity32 's editorial control			1
mr @entity91 issued a statement through the @entity237 yesterday , saying he was cooperating with reviews by the @entity32 and the @entity6 , but would make no public comment until they were completed			2
