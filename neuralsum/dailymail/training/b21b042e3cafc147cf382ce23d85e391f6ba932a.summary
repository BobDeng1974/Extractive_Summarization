@entity0 climbed off the bench at half time to spark a dramatic comeback against @entity4 leaving @entity6 supporters asking why he was n’t on the pitch from the kick - off			1
@entity6 coach @entity9 left more than £ 150million of talent out of his starting line - up against a struggling team without a home win all season and had to change the disastrous team selection at half time to avoid defeat			0
@entity0 and @entity17 were both introduced at the break after a goal from former @entity21 loanee @entity20 gave @entity4 a shock lead			1

referee : @entity73 attendance : 12,606 @entity0 dragged @entity6 back into the game cracking an acrobatic volley on to the cross bar and then setting up @entity17 and @entity23 for the two goals that won @entity6 the match			1
it has been a week for strange team selections and @entity9 ’s starting line - up topped even @entity84 ’ decisions in midweek at @entity85			0
@entity69 , @entity61 , @entity70 , @entity0 and @entity17 were all left on the bench against an @entity4 team yet to win at home			1
@entity4 , whose first team is worth around 10 times less than that all - star bench , could not believe their good fortune			2
they defended comfortably and attacked with purpose throughout the first half			0
@entity20 , who was particularly prominent , put his team ahead on 37 minutes and it was no more than the strugglers deserved			1
@entity63 was dispossessed on the edge of his own area and the reaction from @entity6 said much for their current form			2
the @entity102 failed to respond , dropping his head and beginning his stroll back towards his own half			0
those around him also seemed to stand still			0
@entity63 had only lost the ball because none of the six players ahead of him had been in a position where they could be passed to			2
no - one pressurised @entity43 , who swept the ball forward to @entity20			2
the striker sprinted clear of @entity58 and @entity116 and slipped the ball past the advancing @entity55			0
@entity20 ( no 9 ) shoots past @entity55 to put @entity4 ahead against @entity6 @entity0 has an acrobatic effort but he did set up both of @entity6 's goals the @entity6 striker tries a @entity123 turn to get away from @entity4 defender @entity38 @entity20 ( left ) and @entity124 of @entity4 rob @entity63 of the ball @entity17 ( left ) and @entity0 cut frustrated figures before @entity6 equalised trailing 1 - 0 at half - time @entity6 were 45 minutes from losing three league games on the bounce for the first time since 2003			1
@entity9 ’s team selection had back - fired with disastrous consequences			0
it must have been an uncomfortable visitors ’ dressing room as he faced his players having already sent @entity0 and @entity17 out to warm up			1
both came on at the start of the second half			0
@entity6 had mustered just one first half chance of note with @entity59 from the left and @entity63 looping a header on to the bar			1
@entity0 ’s second - half introduction almost brought the equalizer on the hour when he hit the cross-bar with an acrobatic volley after a @entity59 corner had been flicked on			2
and the former @entity151 man then wriggled clear down the right before centering for @entity17 to roll in the equaliser			0
he could have put @entity6 ahead from the same right wing channel but his cross shot went just the wrong side of @entity36 ’s post			0
the @entity159 star then teed - up @entity63 but the @entity102 headed on to the bar for the second time in the game			0
as the clock ticked down it looked as if @entity0 second half show might bring only a point but with six minutes left he crossed from the right and @entity26 stroked the ball past @entity36 for the winner			1
@entity169 had their three points but @entity9 ’s team selection had made hard work of it and he had @entity0 's second half performance to thank for the turnaround			2
@entity17 is challenged by @entity4 defender @entity37 as the @entity178 looks to get away @entity6 's @entity180 midfielder @entity59 ( right ) wins an aerial battle with @entity39			1

@entity23 set up by @entity0 for winner after @entity17 equalised
@entity20 had put @entity4 ahead in second half
@entity63 missed chance to equal @entity189 scoring record
