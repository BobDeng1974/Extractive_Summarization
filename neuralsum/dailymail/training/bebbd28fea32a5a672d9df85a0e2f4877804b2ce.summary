he was darling of @entity1 this time last year , hailed by supporters for bringing back ‘ the @entity4 ’			1
having got @entity6 playing a slick , fast brand of football that almost took them into the @entity10 , @entity5 could do no wrong but , suddenly , he has become the topic of an increasingly heated debate			1
the argument ? he needs to change and get @entity6 playing a more solid and direct style , like @entity16 favoured			1
maybe some watched @entity19 ’s backs - to - the - wall victory against @entity20 and were reminded of similar big wins that their former manager had inspired			2
@entity5 is under pressure at @entity6 with his team lying just four points ahead of the relegation zone @entity6 have been struggling in the @entity28 and have failed to hit the heights of last season a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity32 on @entity33 was @entity6 's fourth @entity28 loss in a row in many ways , saturday ’s match against @entity37 would have suited @entity16 perfectly			1
he had an outstanding record against them , drilling his players to stay in two banks of four before pouncing on the break or at a set - piece			2
@entity6 were a persistent thorn in @entity37 ’s side			1
but i will be honest — talk of @entity5 needing to change is baffling			1
he has said he is not a manager who will play percentage football			2
he has principles and it should be remembered he got the job at @entity6 on the back of hatching a plan that toppled @entity37 in the @entity58 final			1
these same people 12 months ago were saying @entity16 should have been more open and dynamic like @entity5 yet here they are saying @entity5 now needs to be pragmatic like @entity16			1
so where is the consistency ? @entity63 's late goal earned @entity6 an @entity58 third round replay against @entity65 @entity6 's squad features a lot of the same players from last season such as @entity63 and @entity69 @entity5 took @entity6 to the brink of @entity10 qualification last season everything he has worked on over the past 18 months , all his principles , get thrown out of the window if he switches			1
had @entity5 felt ‘ defence first ’ was the way to take @entity6 forward , he ’d have been doing it since day one			1
a few weeks ago , @entity80 were criticised for being too open , so he made them solid and took seven points out of nine , conceding one goal			0
yet that was n’t him			0
as soon as he could , he got his technical players back in the team			0
do not take this as me trying to sugarcoat a sequence of four consecutive losses in the @entity28 — @entity6 ’s worst run since december 2005 — and a last - gasp draw against @entity65 in the @entity58			1
but to suggest the manager ’s position might be vulnerable is madness			0
@entity5 talks to @entity94 during @entity6 's defeat by @entity96 at @entity97 's in december @entity16 saw his @entity19 side beat @entity20 last sunday in @entity99 an own goal from @entity20 defender @entity101 was enough for @entity19 to earn a 1 - 0 victory so it should not be about him changing or copying what @entity16 did : it is about being better at what he does			1
he will recognise better than anyone that performances have not been good enough and issues need to be addressed			0
@entity6 threw away four points in the first two games against @entity118 and @entity119 and @entity5 thinks the scars remain			1
when @entity6 are confident , they are aggressive and the ball moves quickly			1
without confidence , they are laboured and ponderous			0
other aspects need to be factored in			0
@entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 have not been at their best			0
is that down to the lingering effects of the @entity132 or is it because they are another year older ? what about @entity136 ( 37 ) and @entity137 ( 33 ) too ? @entity6 have several players ageing in the same area of the pitch			1
is that why , after 20 games , they have conceded 33 goals compared with 19 at this stage last season — or is it because @entity5 has n’t tweaked things to make them less exposed ? @entity79 has seen his @entity80 side struggle this season , much like @entity5 then there are the effects of the @entity152			1
@entity6 have been superb in @entity153			1
they beat @entity154 , who are second in the @entity156 , home and away and finished top of their group			0
that shows there is a good side waiting to emerge			0
does playing in @entity153 liberate them ? there is no doubt the added games have hindered domestic results — they have taken only seven points from 18 after @entity152 fixtures — but at least that dream is alive , unlike the target in august , which was @entity10 qualification			1
they wo n’t get into the top four and that will also play on the minds of players who got so close last year			2
when @entity80 almost won the title in 2009 , we lost two of our 38 games			0
the following season , we lost two of our first three			0
psychologically , it becomes difficult when belief wanes			0
when you then factor in the devastating injuries to @entity187 and @entity188 — players who bring the best out of @entity126 and @entity137 — you can see why @entity6 are in the bottom half of the table but , even if they lose to @entity37 , i do n’t see them fighting relegation			2
@entity126 and @entity137 look dejected after @entity6 fell behind against @entity65 @entity126 has struggled to reproduce his form from last year in a blue shirt this season @entity127 has been in indifferent form recently for @entity6 after a strong start to the season @entity136 reached the age of 37 in december i remember a similar situation to this in january 1997			1
@entity6 had a run of four straight defeats , which included an @entity58 shock against @entity205			1
a few weeks later , they hastily and unexpectedly parted company with manager @entity207			0
@entity207 had saved the club from relegation , won the @entity58 in 1995 and got @entity6 back into the top six but losing him set them back years			2
only when chairman @entity210 brought in @entity16 did they begin to move forward again			0
the club really found their stride last season			0
@entity5 , who has the best win percentage of any @entity6 manager in the @entity28 era , masterminded a double over @entity218 , a 3 - 0 demolition of @entity119 and inflicted @entity221 ’s first defeat since his return to @entity223			1
what the noise around @entity5 has shown , is that football — more than ever before — is about winning and his task now is to give @entity228 ‘ proper ’ memories			2
he has to find a way of bringing silverware to @entity1			2
young defender @entity187 has seen the first half of his season ruined by injury @entity188 has missed a number of matches so far this season due to hamstring injuries @entity6 topped @entity239 ahead of @entity154 , @entity240 and @entity241 he delivered a club @entity28 record of 72 points and while that was fantastic , it wo n’t live long in the memory			2
@entity37 ’s emergence and the financial strength of other clubs means getting into the top four will always be a struggle			0
winning a cup , however , should not be impossible			0
when i was kid watching the 1987 title - winning side , nobody would have believed only one more trophy would be added in the next 28 years			0
that is the only thing @entity5 should be worried about changing			2
@entity260 's @entity80 side only lost two games in 2008 - 09 when they almost won the title @entity263 makes me want to put my boots back on ! the @entity265 is awarded to the world ’s best player in @entity268 on monday but i am far more interested in who is named coach of the year			1
@entity272 , for securing @entity273 ’s 10th @entity10 , and @entity132 winner @entity271 will have their supporters but if it was down to me , the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — @entity263			1
his work with @entity279 , which was crowned by winning @entity99 last season , has been unbelievable for the past three years and i watched in awe again on wednesday night when he inspired his side in the @entity283 to a third consecutive victory over @entity19			1
@entity263 has been nominated for coach of the year at @entity287 's awards in @entity268 on monday @entity263 is one of three finalists after guiding @entity279 to the @entity99 title in 2014 the @entity291 boss broke the @entity20 and @entity273 dominance to win the @entity294 title a 2 - 0 victory over rivals real on wednesday was @entity279 's third straight @entity273 derby win that is three straight derby wins after losing the @entity10 final to their neighbours			1
you would have thought losing in @entity303 would have had a psychological impact on @entity305 but nothing could be further from the truth			0
@entity263 is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — i ’d even come out of retirement for him ! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him			1
he would be a magnificent addition to our game			0
in some ways , @entity305 remind me of the @entity80 sides i played for under @entity321 and @entity322			0
we might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in @entity153 we would get a result			0
@entity263 has given that to @entity305			2
@entity279 were denied @entity10 glory as well after losing to @entity273 in the final in @entity303 @entity329 @entity272 is another finalist for coach of the year after his exploits with @entity273 @entity271 guided his @entity333 team to @entity132 glory in @entity335 this summer this week i 'm looking forward to ... @entity338 ’s @entity10 debut with @entity339 so the big question for @entity339 ’s new manager is whether he can have the same effect as @entity343 and keep his side in the @entity28			1
@entity338 has a tough baptism against rejuvenated @entity346 today but his first game as @entity349 manager was against @entity80 in december 2010			2
@entity349 won that 3 - 1			0
some seem surprised he has made the move but , in many ways , it makes a lot of sense			0
geographically , it will help his family and professionally he will get more help from his board and supporters			0
@entity338 is a good manager and i admire that he has been working in the @entity28 for a long time			0
it will be interesting to see how things map out at club for which he has a genuine affinity			0
@entity338 was named as @entity339 's new manager in place of @entity367 @entity338 's first game in charge of @entity349 in december 2010 saw them beat @entity80 3 - 1			2

@entity6 are on their worst run since december 2005 , but the @entity1 fans must get behind @entity5
@entity5 was praised last year for his style of play that took @entity6 to the brink of @entity10 qualification
talk of @entity5 needing to change his style is baffling
@entity263 's work at @entity279 has been unbelievable , i hope he wins @entity287 's coach of the year award
