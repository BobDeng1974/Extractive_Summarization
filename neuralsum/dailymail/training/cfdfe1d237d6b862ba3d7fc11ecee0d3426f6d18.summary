@entity19 - twitter _ @entity3 at @entity20 all set : @entity23 president @entity3 walks out with two bags of cheesecake from @entity26 next to @entity28 mayoral candidate @entity27 in @entity5 on friday afternoon @entity3 - who briefly lived in the @entity30 borough in his younger days - visited the restaurant yesterday with democratic mayoral candidate @entity27 whom he introduced as the ' next mayor ' to customers and staff			1
the president left with two cheesecakes - one traditional and the other strawberry			1
and he was sure to grab some black - and - white cookies ' for his girls '			0
the check came to $ 73 and he paid with $ 80 cash , according to owner @entity42			1
' he said ( his daughters ) were going to eat the cookies on @entity45 on the way back to @entity47 , ' mr @entity42 told @entity48			2
' he greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building ' : onlookers recount @entity3 's visit to a @entity54 's with @entity30 democratic mayoral candidate @entity27 getting around to everyone and then home : @entity3 hugs a young girl in the restaurant before going to see his family ' he greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building , which was quite gracious and amazing to me			1
' literally every single person			0
' it was pretty incredible			0
' the president also left behind a signature on one of the eatery 's large holiday pumpkins			2
@entity5 resident @entity71 said she was enjoying her dinner when the president suddenly walked into the restaurant and could n’t believe her eyes as he walked around the room , hugging people and shaking hands			0
' it was great ! … he said hello to everybody			0
they were hugging him and calling out , ' she said			0
' they applauded him leaving : ‘ thank you for coming			0
we love you ! ’ it was really great			0
' one last thing : president @entity3 leaves behind an autograph on a @entity92 pumpkin before getting his sweets at @entity54 's restaurant in @entity5 friday night crowd : @entity96 were on hand for @entity3 's visit earlier in the day , the president admitted at least two of @entity23 's three branches of government needed to brush up on their math. during a visit to the @entity105 ( p - tech ) in the @entity30 borough of @entity5 , @entity3 observed a level two algebra class , joking that he needed one of the students to help him keep his daughters ' math skills up			1
' the president joked with one of the girls that he needed her to tutor @entity117 and @entity118 , because he 's not very good at helping them with math anymore , ' according to a pool reporter traveling with @entity3			1
@entity117 and @entity118 , the @entity118 ' children , are in the seventh and tenth grades			1
' i liked math , but then it started to get harder			0
and so that can be frustrating , ' the president said , referring to his days as a student , the pool report continued			0
but when @entity3 recalled the classroom visit an hour later in his speech to 600 students and teachers , it was @entity134 – not he – who needed help with numbers			0
real world math : @entity3 jokingly solicited math tutors for his kids while admitting that he was no longer up to the task @entity3 's speech at p - tech high school touched on immigration , government budgets and education issues and adulation : @entity3 's job approval ratings nationally are abysmal , but he is still wildly popular in politically stalwart ' blue ' states like @entity30 , where he arrived at @entity149 on friday ' i know that budgets are n't the most interesting topic for a friday afternoon , ' he said while scolding legislators for the recent government shutdown tussle in @entity47 , ' even in a school where young people like math. ' ' and by the way , i just sat in on a lesson called " @entity160 , " which got me thinking whether it 's too late to send @entity134 here for a remedial course			2
' but the president 's ribbing at @entity134 will be quickly forgotten , at least where it concerns those on the political left			2
@entity3 will deliver another speech on friday night – this time to a @entity30 fundraiser for the @entity169 expected to raise up to $ 32,400 per person			2
do n't tell @entity171 : @entity3 tried to help build an " @entity173 " during a math class , but did n't manage to balance his load and the camera - phones come out : @entity5 high - schoolers jostled to get their own photos of the president as he entered the stage			2
