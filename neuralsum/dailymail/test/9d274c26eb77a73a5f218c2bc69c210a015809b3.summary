a @entity1 cartel boss known as ' @entity2 ' has been detained by the country 's authorities , who claim he is ' linked to the bloodiest events ever recorded in @entity7 '			2
@entity1 federal authorities arrested @entity10 boss @entity9 on friday , bringing an end to the career of a criminal who was famed for dispatching his enemies with the use of dynamite			1
earning the nickname ' @entity2 ' for the brutal and ruthless methods that earned him a place on the @entity23 's most wanted list , @entity9 is charged with multiple felonies including the distribution of narcotics , homicide and arms trafficking			1
in 2008 the @entity48 declared war on the @entity10 as it sought to take control of @entity7 , a city of 1.5 million people that sits on the border with @entity41 , @entity53			1
that year alone saw 1,600 homicides in the city , and @entity56 achieved the title of the most dangerous city in the world for three consecutive years			2
@entity60 , also known as ' @entity61 ' , led the assault on the invading @entity64 forces , causing the bloodshed of narcos , @entity1 authorities and civilians alike			0
a respected ' sicario ' or hired gun , @entity2 was known to have spoken of his ambitions to one day run his own drug cartel			0
in 2008 he was hired by the @entity10 bosses , who sent him to @entity7 to take over command of @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , the cartel 's street - level army of assassins , who were notorious for mutilating the bodies of their enemies and civilians alike			1
the @entity83 was formerly one of the most feared in @entity1 , but is now all but extinct following a war with the @entity87 cartel , and high profile arrests ( pictured , boss @entity89 is arrested in 2005 ) the @entity10 eventually lost the conflict after three murderous years , and today its agents are spread widely across @entity92			1
today @entity7 , once a lively and popular border town , shows the scars of a drug war that cost nearly ten thousand lives over the space of four years			2
entire districts of the city are deserted , rare are the buildings not marked with bullet holes and there are sections where even the police dare not enter given the narcos ' stranglehold on the territory			0
the arrest of the liquidator occurred on friday in his hometown of @entity111 , some 80 miles south of @entity7			0
a gunfight occurred as the task - force moved in to detain @entity9 and his two bodyguards , one of whom was killed in an exchange of fire			1
following @entity2 's detention , federal agents seized a number of items that were in his possession , including 2 suvs , 4 quad - bikes , a large bag of marijuana , a heavy - duty assault rifle , us $ 20,000 in cash and some 17 mobile telephones			0
danger : soldiers stand guard atop vehicles along a road where @entity9 was detained last week @entity9 had been cartel boss for six months before he was captured after taking over from @entity138 , arrested in october last year following his arrest , @entity140 criminal associates fled northwards to the town of @entity143 and the surrounding region , threatening local people with death if they did not help them in their plight			1
a number of complaints were made to the police from residents of the town			0
the liquidator had only been in the top spot for six months , following the arrest of former @entity10 boss @entity138 in october of last year			1
the arrest is expected to put an end to what is an already significantly weakened criminal organisation following its defeat at the hands of @entity64			0
following a difficult 2014 for the @entity1 government – a scandal - filled year topped by the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of local police in @entity168 state - the country 's authorities have made a number of drug kingpin arrests			1
' this government has neutralised 93 of the total 122 targets that it set out when it came to power ' , national security commissioner @entity174 told reporters following @entity2 's arrest			0
saturday saw the arrest of another cartel boss , @entity181 , supposed leader of the @entity182 that operates on the eastern end of the @entity185 - @entity1 border			1
his arrest in @entity187 , a town which borders @entity188 in @entity53 saw the sustained attack by over 60 armed criminals in 15 vehicles on the @entity193 's office in the town centre			0
the criminals laid siege to the building for over three hours without success in an attempt to prevent their leader 's extraction to @entity202 , where he and @entity60 will both be formally charged with drug trafficking , homicide and multiple other felonies this week			0
the @entity10 , which was founded in 1970 , claims to be the first drug cartel to have moved cocaine into the @entity185 by aircraft			2
the @entity210 gang , which operates in a number of @entity53 cities including @entity41 and @entity213 is aligned with the @entity10			2

@entity9 , current leader of the @entity10 , under arrest
police say they can directly link the former hitman to more than 20 deaths
