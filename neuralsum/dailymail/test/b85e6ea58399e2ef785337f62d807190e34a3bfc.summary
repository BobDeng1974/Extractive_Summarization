as healer @entity2 rests with a threadbare blanket over his creaking knees , the 82 - year - old looks to the future			0
it is almost 70 years since he fled the violence that followed the partition of @entity8 , and he is still regarded as a second class citizen in @entity8 @entity10 – unable to own property or vote in state elections			1
but now @entity14 and thousands like him are daring to hope they will finally be able to shed the refugee status that has plagued them for decades , after prime minister @entity20 's @entity19 nationalist party won a share of power in @entity8 's only muslim - majority state			1
@entity2 was 14 when he fled to @entity10 as a refugee - now an old man , for the past 70 years he has been denied citizenship rights a hindu , traditional healer @entity2 lives a slum house within @entity8 's only muslim - majority state			1
its rulers have refused to give the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) the right to own property or vote in state elections - meaning three generations are caught in abject poverty ‘ if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life , ’ the traditional healer said from his slum home on the outskirts of @entity42 , @entity10 's winter capital			1
‘ if only the gods could show us some mercy			0
’ @entity2 , a @entity19 , was born in an area of @entity52 province , part of modern - day @entity54 but within @entity8 ’s boundaries before the country became independent in 1947			1
hundreds of thousands of families fled across both sides of the border during the conflict which led to the partition of the sub-continent			0
around one million people were killed in the bloody war between the two countries @entity2 , aged 82 , with the success of prime minister @entity20 's @entity19 nationalist party at a recent state vote , he says he is hopeful change will come for the @entity54 refugees : ' if something can be done , then maybe i will finally have some enjoyment in this life ' around 100,000 people are classified as refugees - despite most of them never visiting @entity54 , and living in the @entity42 region of @entity8 most of those refugees were quickly absorbed in towns and cities of the newly - independent nations			1
however the fate of the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) like @entity14 who decamped to @entity42 and @entity10 state became mired in the dispute with @entity54 over the territory			1
because of this , its rulers held off granting the refugees residential rights , including the right to buy land , vote in state polls or work in the state government			2
. observers say the reluctance of successive state governments to grant full rights to the overwhelmingly @entity31 stems from fears of upsetting the demographic balance in @entity8 's only muslim - majority state , which has special autonomy enshrined in the constitution			2
a @entity19 refugee washes pots at a communal hand pump in @entity112 , on the outskirts of @entity42			1
the area has evolved into one of the many slum settlements in @entity118 - dominated areas of the city region of @entity42 , within @entity8 's only @entity121 - majority state generations of families have become stuck in poverty because of their continuing refugee status			1
successive governments have failed to act to due , say commentators , to a fear of upsetting the demographic balance of the state between the @entity121 and @entity19 populations the @entity31 , whose families mainly originate from @entity52 , have fallen foul of a pre-independence law that only grants citizenship to people born - or descendants of those born - in the old undivided kingdom of @entity10			1
the same legislation has allowed around 35,000 @entity19 who have fled @entity54 - controlled @entity10 since partition to be granted citizenship			1
there are around 100,000 people classified as @entity146 , most living in the @entity42			2
hardly any of them have ever set foot in @entity54			2

the community live in poverty , while @entity10 is one of @entity8 's more prosperous states			1
activist @entity156 said : ' granting us state - subject rights is the only way to improve our condition ' with a @entity19 nationalist party winning a share of power in @entity10 , there is hope			1
@entity166 are expected to champion the refugees ' cause			0
but a veteran activist @entity170 warned the community is not afraid to take matters into their own hands suspected rebels shot dead three unarmed policemen monday in the disputed @entity177 region of @entity10			2
the three policemen were investigating a dispute between neighbours when they were fired on by at least three militants wearing army uniforms , officials said			0
in a separate attack , another officer was critically wounded after suspected militants shot at him inside a bus near northern @entity189 , police said			0
no rebel group immediately claimed responsibility for either attack			0
@entity10 has been in conflict for decades , with rebels fighting either for independence or a merger with neighboring @entity54 , which also claims the territory in its entirety while administering part of it			1
source : @entity201 and despite prevailing unrest from different factions , who either fight for independence or to merge once again with @entity54 , @entity10 is one of @entity8 's more prosperous states			1
yet the estimated 18,000 @entity30 families however live in abject poverty , mostly marrying among themselves because of their low economic status			2
' i spend whatever money i earn to send my children to school , " said @entity211 , a part - time driver who lives with his wife , two children and mother in a two - room hovel			0
he says he thinks the law is ‘ ridiculous ’ , adding : ‘ i was born here ( in @entity8 )			0
what else do i and my children need to be citizens of this place ? ’ as things stand , @entity211 's children can not be admitted to state - run training colleges or be employed in the state government , although they can work for the federal one			0
but the tide may soon turn on the rights given to refugees , after a pledge by the newly - elected @entity166 to normalise the @entity31 ' status			0
although the @entity166 came second in the december hustings , they have joined a @entity10 governing coalition for the first time and are expected to champion the @entity31 ' cause			2
' we have been living here like this for three generations now , ' said veteran activist @entity156			0
' granting us state - subject rights is the only way to improve our condition			0
' but he warned the community is ready to take matters into their own hands if their hopes are dashed again			0
‘ we will spill our blood on the streets for our rights , ’ he says			0
the daughter of a @entity19 refugee studies in her slum home in @entity112			2
under the current laws she is not allowed to enrolled at a state - run training college or be employed by the state government			0
such laws , argue opponents , make these families ' second class citizens '			0

thousands of people caught in poverty because successive governments refuse to change their refugee status
laws mean that the @entity54 refugees living in @entity276 and @entity10 can not vote in elections or own property
hopes that election of @entity19 nationalist party as a coalition partner could herald *historic* change for the community
