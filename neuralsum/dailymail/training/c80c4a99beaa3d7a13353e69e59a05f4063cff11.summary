a @entity1 - based designer has come up with a collection of zombie - proof vehicles , just in time for @entity4			1
@entity5 from @entity6 in @entity7 , created the @entity8 with 3d rendering after being inspired by his love of horror films			1
the 31 - year - old put the collection together after imagining what city - life would be like if the streets were taken over by wandering undead , from which there would be no safer escape than one of these modified , mobile fortresses			1
graphic designer @entity5 was inspired to create the collection with @entity24 by his love of horror films and fascination with how they ' put people out of their comfort zone ' a typical @entity1 bus is kitted out with survival equipment including barrels for water and canned foods in the collection which imagines survival in a post-apocalyptic world ' the concept for the series sprouted from my love of detailed @entity24 cross section renders , ' said @entity5 , who works predominantly within broadcast			1
' their inherit ability to infuse narrative through the placement of details			0
' i really wanted the viewer to study and create for themselves , to theorise about whom the survivor or survivors are and what kind of background they came from			0
' ' i paired this interest with my love of horror films and their ability to place people outside their comfort zones			1
' ' i felt the concept of an end of civilization / zombie attack would be an ideal way to explain these bizarre and abnormal creations			0
' his designs range from a @entity1 taxi to a royal mail van stuffed with survival foods including potatoes and baked beans			1
speaking to @entity77 , the designer said : ' each one was rendered and created for large format printing			2
' plus i felt the concept of protection from the outside world and our attempt to cling onto some form of reality was fascinating			2
a royal mail van is converted into an apocalyptic survival zone complete with a bookshelf , ladder and fire extinguisher in @entity5 's collection of rendered images a small @entity95 flag droops at the front of this battered @entity98 taxi which seems to have lost its doors and windows amidst the zombie - populated city an @entity104 tuk - tuk is kitted out with stationary machine guns and a bow - and arrow			1
flood lights are positioned at the top of the vehicle to locate unwanted passengers the graphic designer from @entity6 , @entity7 , said he was inspired by his love of @entity113 as well as his passion for films such as @entity116 , starring @entity117 ' these themes lead me to the zombie survival vehicles			1
' alongside basic necessities like water and food are more personalised items imagined by @entity5 with individual characters in mind			2
photographs , books and rosary beads are among weapons such as knives and rifles , as the driver tried to imagine people who ' live , drive and survive ' in the modified vehicles			2
' i also wanted to put some small detailed textures somewhere in the vehicles - blood stains , scrawled writings , pop culture designs etc , ' he said			2
' i 've also had people interested in commissioning new pieces personal to them , such as modeling their father 's car and filling it with his favorite possessions			0
even modeling and designing whole buildings			0
' ' from the bookshelf on the upper storage space of the royal mail van to the @entity95 flag stuck in the grille of the yellow taxi			0
' all of the vehicles are equipped with a map at the driver 's seat			0
in addition to fuel reserves they each have a weapon of choice ranging from pick - axes to machine guns			0
prints of the images can be purchased online .			0
