by @entity0 published : 04:03 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 12 june 2013 an invasion by millions of caterpillars has turned a graveyard into a spooky scene from a horror film			1
mourners at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , have been astounded by the phenomenon - with the caterpillars crawling along dozens of gravestones , benches and trees			1
the bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars , which have created web - like nests and left the graveyard with a ghostly white appearance , even hang from the trees on thin strands of their silken threads			1
unusual sight : the bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars , which have created web - like nests and left the graveyard with a ghostly white appearance , even hang from the trees on thin strands of their silken threads @entity33 : in their caterpillar stage , the bugs , known as web worms , weave leaves of trees together there are no plans to remove the caterpillars , known as ' web worms ' , because they do not cause any damage to the headstones and benches			1
@entity46 , 42 , who was left stunned when she visited the graveyard to lay flowers , said : ‘ it really is quite a sight - i do n’t think i have ever seen anything quite like this before			2
the bird cherry ermine moth is entirely harmless - unlike many other caterpillars that cause infestations			1
they can be found across @entity56 as well as in northern and eastern @entity57			0
ranging in size from 0.6 to 1in , they live on bird cherry trees and make an extensive web - like nest			1
they can eat an entire tree bare although many trees survive with reduced growth in the following growth seasons			1
in 2011 , 20 matures trees disappeared under a web of white silk in @entity70 when they experienced an infestation			2
experts say there are often outbreaks in areas with a group of bird cherry trees - which are quite rare in @entity78 , compared to @entity79			1
it is not thought year - on - year climate variations affect the numbers of caterpillars - but it is believed the rise in reports of recent outbreaks may be simply because people are noticing the webs more , following increased publicity			2
it is not for the faint - hearted because the caterpillars look like maggots or worms which really could make your stomach turn			2
' but there is something quite beautiful too in the way they create the ghostly white webs that hang from the trees			2
it would be the perfect setting for a scene from a horror movie - it reminds me of @entity110 films like @entity111			0
' following a similar phenomenon at the cemetery this time three years ago - which was also reported by @entity115 's natural history curator @entity114 had said the caterpillars would emerge as moths in july			1
the invasion is not the only of its kind seen this month			0
as reported last thursday , a plague of the same bugs has covered pavements , walls and cars in @entity125 , south - west @entity126			2
today , mr @entity114 told @entity115 : ‘ maybe they have received a bit of publicity recently and people are noticing them a bit more			0
' sometimes you get really specific outbreaks and people notice			0
often people see a tree covered in webbing and think that is unusual and could be spiders			0
they do n't really connect it with thousands and thousands of small caterpillars			0
‘ i do n't think the climate affects them very much			0
it just so happens that somebody long ago thought they would plant bird cherry trees at the cemetery - and this is an unlimited supply			1
‘ it 's probably a migrant moth that laid a few eggs there years ago			1
it 's not a common tree around here in the @entity159			0
the only thing that knocks them back a bit are wasp parasites			0
‘ so that is the main way in which the population is controlled , because birds do n't seem to touch them - i suspect because they do n't taste very nice			0
the web does offer some sort of protection			0
’ webs : there are no plans to remove the caterpillars because they do not cause any damage to the area elsewhere : the avenue of trees on @entity179 in @entity180 , which has been covered by the caterpillar webs last week : as shown in these pictures from last thursday , a plague of bird cherry @entity185 caterpillars has completely covered pavements , walls and cars on a street in @entity125 , south - west @entity126			1

bugs have made their home at a cemetery in @entity8 , @entity9
the bird cherry ermine moth caterpillars have created web - like nests
similar phenomenon happened in the graveyard just three years ago
' web worms ' create web - like nests so they can eat entire trees bare
