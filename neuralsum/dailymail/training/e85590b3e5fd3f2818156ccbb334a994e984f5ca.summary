so says a year - old law that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make @entity15 's , the world 's best - known @entity4 whiskey			1
now state lawmakers are considering dialing back some of those requirements that they say make it too difficult for craft distilleries to market their spirits as @entity4 whiskey , a distinctive and popular draw in the booming @entity26 liquor business			1
made to exact proportions : if it is n't fermented in @entity4 from mash of at least 51 percent corn , aged in new charred oak barrels , filtered through maple charcoal and bottled at a minimum of 80 proof , it is n't @entity4 whiskey but the people behind @entity15 's see the hand of a bigger competitor at work — @entity38 , the @entity39 conglomerate that owns @entity40 , another @entity4 whiskey made about 15 miles up the road			1
' it 's really more to weaken a title on a label that we 've worked very hard for , ' said @entity48 , the master distiller at the @entity15 's distillery in @entity51 , @entity4 ' as a state , i do n't think @entity4 should be bashful about being protective of @entity4 whiskey over say bourbon or scotch or any of the other products that we compete with			2
' @entity58 state rep. @entity57 emphasized that his bill would n't do away with last year 's law enacted largely on the behest of @entity15 's corporate parent , @entity63 , @entity64 , - based @entity65 the principal change would be to allow @entity4 whiskey makers to reuse barrels , which he said would present considerable savings over new ones that can cost $ 600 each			1
' there are a lot of ways to make high - quality whiskey , even if it 's not necessarily the way @entity15 's does it , ' @entity57 said			2
' what gives them the right to call theirs @entity4 whiskey , and not others ? ' @entity57 acknowledged that he introduced the measure at @entity38 's urging , but said it would also help micro distilleries opening across the state			1
@entity38 picked up on the same theme			0
' this is n't about @entity38 , as all of our @entity4 whiskey is made with new oak , ' said @entity38 executive vice president @entity93 ' this is about @entity65 trying to stifle competition and the entrepreneurial spirit of micro distillers			1
' we are not sure what they are afraid of , as we feel new innovative products from a new breed of distillers is healthy for the entire industry , ' he said			0
special blend : @entity48 , the master distiller at the @entity107 in @entity51 , @entity4 tests the aroma of whiskey at the distillery			1
@entity15 's is fighting efforts in the state legislature to dial back the legal definition of @entity4 whiskey , including a provision that requires the spirit to be aged in new oak barrels @entity15 's last year sold 11.5 million cases of it @entity120 last year , a 5 percent increase from 2012			1
@entity40 , the second - largest @entity4 whiskey producer , sold 130,000 cases in 2013			2
the standards and special branding of @entity4 whiskey are an outgrowth of the special designation granted long ago to bourbon			1
a half - century ago , @entity129 declared bourbon a distinctive product of the @entity26			0
by law , bourbon must be made of a grain mix of at least 51 percent corn , distilled at less than 160 proof , have no additives except water to reduce the proof and be aged in new , charred white oak barrels			1
spirits that do n't follow those guidelines ca n't be sold as bourbon			0
one example is @entity65 's own @entity142 , which is marketed as a ' @entity64 whisky ' because it is made in reused barrels			0
@entity145 , the president @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity4 , said it is more difficult to distinguish spirits not meeting the @entity4 standard			2
' if i made whiskey in @entity4 in a used barrel , what it would be called then ? ' he said			2
' whiskey , made in @entity4 ? ' @entity157 , a lobbyist representing @entity40 and @entity158 , said the law passed last year would require all @entity4 whiskies to taste like @entity15 's			1
preparing to fight : a law that was introduced last year says the whiskey must be made in a way that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make @entity15 's ' it 's not unlike if the beer guys 25 years ago had said all @entity26 beer has to be made like @entity169 , ' @entity157 said			1
' you never would have a @entity171 or a @entity172 or any of those guys			0
' but @entity4 craft distillers are divided about the state law			2
@entity176 , the ceo of @entity178 's @entity177 in @entity179 , said he supports tighter regulation			0
' holding ourselves to a higher standard will ultimately be better for all the people in the category , ' he said			0
' if we lower the standards , it could lead to more products and brands that could lower the reputation of @entity4 whiskey			2
' whiskey is clear when it goes into the barrel			0
it 's during the aging process that the whiskey acquires color and flavors			0
@entity15 's @entity48 said other distillers reusing barrels might resort to using artificial colorings and flavorings that would n't match the quality of the whiskey stored in new barrels			0
' we 've been making whiskey a long time , and we know that would not uphold the quality that people expect from @entity4 whiskey , ' he said			0
' so we would n't dare consider doing it , even though it would save us millions of dollars every year			0
' change in the law ? lawmakers are looking at amending that law so that some of the craft distillers that have sprung up in recent years can label their products @entity4 whiskey , a distinctive and popular draw in the booming @entity26 liquor business			1
the people behind @entity15 's see the hand of a bigger rival at work , however , the foreign - owned conglomerate that makes @entity40 , another famed @entity4 brand @entity15 's stores its whiskey in new barrels made at a @entity65 plant			1
@entity57 argues that the flavor and color of the whiskey is determined more by the charring of the inside of the barrels , which he said is a process that can be repeated			0
consumers would ultimately decide whether the end product matches up			0
' if they 're making an inferior product , the market will decide , ' he said .			0

distilleries in @entity4 want to change a year - old law that states @entity246 must be made a certain way
the manufacture includes using special charred oak barrels
lawmakers want to change the rules because the standards say make it difficult for craft distilleries to sell their whiskey as @entity246 and puts them at a significant *disadvantage*
@entity107 opposes the change , saying that any *adjustment* would dilute the appeal of @entity246
the big change would be to allow whiskey makers to *re-use* their barrels , which would significantly cut costs
specialty barrels can cost up to $ 600
