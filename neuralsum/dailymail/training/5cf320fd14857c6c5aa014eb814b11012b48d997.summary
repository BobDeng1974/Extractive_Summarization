by @entity0 published : 19:59 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 02:22 est , 26 february 2014 the first night in the @entity3 for a family of @entity6 tourists ended with the parents being pulled from their rental car at gunpoint with their young son watching after their confusion about @entity3 traffic laws set off a high - speed pursuit in southern @entity14			1
the pursuit began at 1 a.m. saturday on @entity16 near the @entity14 - @entity18 border when the couple 's car was spotted going just 37 mph and swerving between lanes , said lt. @entity22 , @entity24 's @entity23 unit commander			1
more than a dozen patrolmen were working the area in a special @entity23 operation , and @entity22 said he figured the car was being driven by a drunken driver			2
@entity22 turned on his lights and siren to pull the car over			2
confused : a @entity6 couple who 'd just arrived to the @entity3 and were driving through southern @entity14 with their 7 - year - old son when police tried to pull them over			1
the driver , a woman in her 40s , sped up thinking she was supposed to get out of the way of the police car instead of pulling over , the driver sped up to 75 mph and began driving erratically , he said			1
her speeds fluctuated between 40 and 75 mph as she weaved across lanes and into the shoulder			0
soon , there were three patrol cars in pursuit with other officers closing highway offramps and setting tire spikes miles ahead , @entity22 said			1
' it was literally red and blue lights in every direction , ' @entity22 said			0
the couple 's car skidded to a stop about 7 miles north of where the pursuit began after three of the tires deflated after hitting the spikes			1
a patrolman bellowed commands from a loudspeaker in his patrol car , telling the couple to exit and walk backward			1
both directions of @entity16 were closed as officers prepared to encounter hardened criminals			0
instead , a @entity6 woman in her early 40s emerged			2
' she would walk forward , backward , spin around â € ” obviously she had no clue what we wanted her to do , ' @entity22 said			0
dramatic : the chase stretched over seven miles of @entity14 highway as police shut down exit ramps , laid out spike strips and barreled down the road in pursuit of the confused visitors still bracing for the worst , officers approached the car with guns drawn and pulled the woman and a man from the car			2
that 's when they saw the couple 's 7 - year - old son in the backseat and realized the family did n't speak @entity95			1
the boy was crying , and the parents appeared nervous and confused , @entity22 said			0
' i think they were terrified , ' he said			0
realizing they were dealing with language and cultural barriers , and not a drunken driver or fugitive , officers changed their strategy , @entity22 said			2
one officer consoled the boy and reunited him with his parents as others worked to get a @entity6 - speaking officer on the phone			1
they found one in northern @entity14 who spoke to the couple and learned they had arrived from @entity6 on friday morning and rented a car to drive from @entity117 to @entity118 in southern @entity14			1
the woman said she had no idea what she was supposed to do when the patrolman put on his lights and siren , so she sped up to get out of the way			0
she kept apologizing for crashing the car , not realizing they ran over tire spikes , @entity22 said			0
@entity128 took the family to a motel and wished them safe travels			0
nobody was hurt and no cars damaged other than the flat tires , he said			0
about a dozen law enforcement officers were involved in some way			0
authorities do n't plan to pursue charges			0
@entity22 said the couple did n't have @entity6 driver 's licenses with them			1
@entity22 said he 's encountered many tourists in his three decades working with the @entity24 , but he 's never seen a situation escalate like this			1
' red and blue lights are a pretty universal signal , ' @entity22 said			0
' regardless of nationality and language , when we put lights on , people pull over and stop			2

@entity24 says they intended to pull over the @entity6 couple for going too slow when they *suddenly* sped up
three patrol cars pursued what they thought was a drunk driver for seven miles
the tourists *finally* came to a stop and found themselves surrounded by heavily armed officers as their 7 - year - old son screamed from the backseat
