under scrutiny : @entity3 has faced a ' witch hunt ' resembling a medieval show trial , her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday @entity3 has faced a ‘ witch hunt ’ resembling a medieval show trial , her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday			1
the former news international chief executive has been subjected to public revulsion over accusations she presided over a six - year conspiracy to hack phones , including hacking the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl @entity18 , the @entity10 was told			1
during her seven - month trial the 45 - year - old ’s actions have been examined and scrutinised ‘ in a way which may well be unprecedented in the history of @entity26 justice , ’ her lawyer @entity20 said			1
mr @entity27 said she had been given a fair trial but said the prosecution ’s attitude towards her had ‘ at times been that of a witch hunt ’			2
in his final remarks to the jury , the lawyer likened her treatment at the hands of prosecutor @entity39 to a ‘ medieval show trial ’ where a woman accused of witchcraft would be tied to a ducking stool , and acquitted if she drowned but burned at the stake as a witch if she survived			1
he said : ‘ just as in a medieval show trial you could tell a true witch when she floated , so mr @entity49 will interpret every piece of evidence about @entity53 - everything she says and everything anyone else says about her - as a sign of guilt , regardless of its true meaning			1
‘ if mrs @entity3 writes an email to a member of her staff instructing that person to act lawfully , to make sure everything they do is 110 percent justified , right and proper , it only goes to show she knew they were up to no good in the first place			2
‘ if she comes across as a nice person in the witness box , it ’s only a cunning mask			0
if she makes you laugh , it ’s only because she ’s telling you lies			0
‘ if her evidence makes sense it ’s only because it is carefully scripted			0
’ arriving at court : the former news international chief executive ( left ) has been subjected to public revulsion over accusations she presided over a six - year conspiracy to hack phones , @entity20 ( right ) said such lies in her evidence would be ‘ cynical perjury ’ , mr @entity27 said , and urged the jury to ignore public revulsion over the @entity89 ’s hacking of murdered schoolgirl @entity18			1
he told the eight women and three men : ‘ there are those who love her [ @entity96 ] deeply but she ’s become , since @entity18 , a controversial figure and many people hate her			2
’ @entity96 , a married mother - of - one , denies she knew about phone hacking at the now defunct sunday tabloid , including the targeting of the murdered schoolgirl ’s voicemail messages in 2002			1
mr @entity27 said the prosecution had itself called a witness who had deliberately lied to the jury			0
tragic : @entity96 allegedly presided over the hacking of the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl @entity18 he said @entity110 , the ex-wife of golfer @entity111 , had told a ‘ bare - faced lie ’ when she gave evidence that @entity96 had joked about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her former husband , @entity116 actor @entity115 , and had admitted a story in the @entity89 had come from hacking			2
in fact @entity96 was not arrested over the alleged assault until three months after the episode mrs @entity110 described so the conversation could not have happened			0
mr @entity27 said : ‘ there ’s simply no possibility mrs @entity110 has got it wrong by mistake			0
’ prosecutors and police were so eager to include her evidence as a ‘ coup ’ in their case against @entity96 that they failed to carry out basic checks which would have proved it was false , he told the court			2
‘ perhaps they took mrs @entity110 entirely at face value			0
she ’s an affluent ex-wife of a famous golfer , well - spoken , apparently credible , why test her account ? perhaps they did n’t want to			0
‘ she was certainly an important witness in the prosecution case but she was a liar , ’ mr @entity27 said			0
he suggested mrs @entity110 could have been motivated by a personal vendetta or grudge against @entity96 or could have hoped to win more compensation from @entity144 in her civil case as a victim of phone hacking			2
@entity96 denies plotting to hack phones and commit misconduct by making allegedly corrupt payments to a public official for information while she was editor at the @entity153 the information led to stories which had exposed wrongdoing in the @entity157 which the @entity158 had attempted to cover up , mr @entity27 said , including a recruit seriously injured in an attack by his drill sergeant			1
court : in his final remarks to the @entity10 ( pictured ) , mr @entity27 likened @entity96 's treatment at the hands of prosecutor @entity39 to a ' medieval show trial ' where a woman accused of witchcraft would go ' on trial ' the lawyer said @entity96 had been painted as ‘ the arch criminal ’ who had sanctioned hacking and misconduct and then involved her husband @entity96 , her @entity176 and @entity144 ’s head of security in another plot to hide evidence from police			1
he said she had faced ‘ profound anger ’ over the closure of the @entity89 in 2011 , but added : ‘ not one former colleague , not one disgruntled reporter has come forward to say she had anything to do with phone hacking			0
’ @entity96 denies conspiring to hack phones , commit misconduct and pervert the course of justice			1
all the defendants in the case , including her former lover @entity194 , who later became @entity197 ’s director of communications in @entity198 , deny all the accusations against them			0
