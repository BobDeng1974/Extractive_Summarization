a child 's genes have a far greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or the efforts of their parents , researchers claim			1
analysis of 11,000 teenagers ’ gcse results suggests that @entity12 is twice as significant as environmental factors such as school choice in determining educational success			1
the study , published by researchers at @entity18 , will go some way towards swaying the course of the great nature vs nurture debate			1
a child 's genes have a far greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or the efforts of their parents , a new study by @entity18 has revealed			1
file picture it will also bolster the stock of @entity35 mayor @entity34 , who last month provoked anger by suggesting that some people , ‘ like cornflakes rising to the top of the packet ’ , reach powerful positions because they are naturally more intelligent than others			1
the new study suggests that each child ’s genes make , on average , a 58 per cent difference for their results in the core subjects of @entity50 , maths and science			1
environmental factors such as school , neighbourhood and the family home , are said to have an impact of just 29 per cent			2
other factors unique to each individual account for the remaining 13 per cent , the study suggests			2
genetics appear to have a bigger influence on results for science subjects than for humanities such as media studies , art or music – 58 per cent compared with 42 per cent			0
study leader @entity69 said : ‘ children differ in how easily they learn at school			2
our research shows that differences in students ’ educational achievement owe more to nature than nurture			1
’ mayor of london @entity34 provoked anger last month when he linked success in life to a person 's iq however , he warned against assuming that educational achievements are ‘ genetically predetermined ’			1
instead , recognising the predispositions of each child may help improve learning , he said			0
he said a personalised education that took account of children ’s differences would be better than a ‘ one size fits all ’ system which ignores genetics			0
the paper , published in the journal @entity96 , said the findings may come as ‘ an uncomfortable realisation ’ to those in education			0
many teachers and politicians fear that a genetic approach to education may lead to less intelligent children being written off			0
but professor @entity105 , who co-wrote the paper , said : ‘ it means that educational systems which are sensitive to children ’s individual abilities and needs , which are derived in part from their genetic predispositions , might improve educational achievement			1
’ the researchers compared the gcse results of identical twins – who share 100 per cent of their genes – with those of non-identical twins , who share only 50 per cent of their dna			2
by subtracting the environmental impact , the scientists could disentangle nature from nurture and determine the impact of genes on the school results			1
most of the genes that contribute to educational success have yet to be identified , although a 2010 study discovered small variants linked to mathematical ability			1
mr @entity69 said : ‘ once we understand more about how the genetic influences work , or once we can identify potential problems early on , we ’ll be better able to target specific interventions to help those individuals who might otherwise struggle			0
’ @entity138 cartoon however other scientists warned that the study should be treated with caution			0
dr @entity142 , of @entity143 , said the research can not show that intelligence is the product of one or two simple genes			0
‘ rather it is managed by an intricate process that relies on genetic factors and environmental influences			0
the nature - nurture debate is not over yet , ’ he added			2
@entity153 , director of the @entity154 , said the idea of tailoring education based on genetics should be treated with a ‘ great degree of scepticism ’			0
mr @entity34 was accused of ‘ elitism ’ last month when he said some people would always find it easier to get ahead than others			2
‘ whatever you may think of the value of iq tests , it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an iq below 85 , while about 2 per cent have an iq above 130 , ’ he said			0
he suggested that competition was good because it meant that those with natural ability would be pushed to work harder .			0

study reveals a child 's genes have greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or efforts of their parents
