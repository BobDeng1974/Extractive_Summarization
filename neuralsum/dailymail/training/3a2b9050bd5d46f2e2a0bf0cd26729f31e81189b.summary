by @entity0 published : 17:32 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 17:32 est , 23 march 2012 in suede jacket , checked shirt and smart loafers , the grey - haired gentleman walking down the street is a picture of well - to - do respectability			2
a few paces ahead , with cropped hair , tattoos and jogging pants , is a young man who looks like life has dealt him a somewhat tougher hand			2
but although they appear to come from opposite ends of the social spectrum , this is , in fact , father and son			2
the older man is @entity23 , 64 , grandson of @entity24 of @entity25 , childhood friend of the @entity26 and godson of the @entity28			1
family stroll : lord @entity30 and his son @entity31 walking in @entity33 's @entity32 this week slightly ahead of him and chatting on a mobile phone , is his son , the @entity35 @entity23 , 30 – also known as lord @entity36 – who has fought a long battle with crack cocaine and heroin			1
over the years , the distance between them has been much greater than the few paces that separated them in a @entity33 street earlier this week			1
in the darkest days of @entity31 ’s drug addiction , there was talk of his parents disinheriting him			2
they were said to be worried about leaving @entity50 , the 5,000 - acre ancestral estate and 60 - room stately home in @entity53 , in his care and feared he would squander the family ’s £ 100million fortune			2
then two years ago , @entity23 suddenly decided to leave @entity50 , and @entity59 , his wife of more than 30 years , for a new life in the @entity62 with his mistress			1
the romance was complicated and his lover , @entity65 , 58 , the widow of baronet sir @entity66 , is said to have dumped him at one point			2
they have since been spotted back in @entity33 , where @entity23 has a home in @entity71			1
this week , he spent the afternoon with his son , strolling down the @entity32 and visiting the @entity75 department store in @entity76			1
it was , perhaps , a sign of a positive development in @entity31 ’s life , which despite its great privilege , has seen him struggle to beat his demons			2
royal connections : @entity23 with his father and prince @entity26 in 1998 @entity31 was educated at @entity84 , where he helped mentor family friend @entity85 , who was in the year below			1
then he went on to @entity86 but dropped out after just six weeks and descended into drug addiction			0
by 2009 , the young heir had sunk so low that fellow junkies caught him on camera smoking crack and heroin , and sold the film to a downmarket newspaper			1
an expensive spell in rehab followed			0
shabby though @entity31 appeared on his stroll , with his tattoo collection having grown , and dark bags under his eyes , he actually looked healthier than he has for some time			0
he has put on weight and seemed at ease in the company of the man he calls ‘ pops ’			0
like his father , @entity31 has a somewhat colourful private life			2
eighteen months ago , it was revealed he was engaged to @entity109 , 29 , an unmarried @entity111 - @entity110 mother of two brought up on a grim south @entity33 council estate			1
the state of the romance is unclear at the moment			0
although his mother @entity116 , a long - term confidante and carriage - driving companion of prince @entity28 , reportedly disowned @entity31 after he was filmed smoking crack , his father was said to have been heartened by his son finding love			1
a friend told the @entity122 in december 2010 that while @entity23 may not be ‘ thrilled that she may well be the next @entity123 , as long as @entity31 is going in the right direction in can only be viewed as a positive thing ’			1
the women in his life : @entity23 's wife @entity59 ( left ) and his mistress @entity65 ( right ) early days : @entity23 with @entity130 , a nine - year - old @entity31 ( middle ) and his sisters @entity133 ( left ) and @entity134 ( right ) and tough as it is to deal with a child ’s drug addiction , @entity23 has suffered enough tragedy to be able to keep it all in perspective			1
in 1979 he lost his grandfather @entity141 when the @entity142 bombed his private boat just off @entity144			0
his beloved younger brother @entity31 , 14 , also died , as well as deckhand @entity141 , 15			0
his grandmother , @entity123 , 83 , died of her injuries the following day			0
when his first son was born , @entity23 named him after the brother he had lost			1
but although so much hope was invested in @entity31 , the boy seemed destined for trouble			0
more tragedy hit the family when daughter @entity133 died of a kidney tumour aged five in 1991			0
she is buried at @entity50			0
the @entity159 ’ other child , @entity134 , 29 , a theology graduate and goddaughter of princess @entity157 , has reportedly been groomed to take over the family estate when the time comes			0
since @entity23 deserted @entity50 , his estranged wife has taken over the running of the estate and even replaced him as the @entity165 of @entity36			1
the daughter of a former butcher who founded the @entity169 restaurant chain , she was plain @entity170 when she married into the family in 1979			0
the first @entity172 was mp @entity173 , given the hereditary title in 1880			0
the family motto is ‘ my glory is in the cross ’ .			0
