his range of expert topics ranged from foreign languages to economics and politics , via science and classical music			2
in the wake of the team 's win , @entity6 viewers took to the internet to express their admiration for mr @entity7 - and the cable - knit jumpers he sported on screen			1
team : the @entity3 students thrashed their opponents from @entity14 , @entity3 quizmaster : the @entity37 show is hosted by @entity43 , notorious for his aggressive putdowns 1 ) ' this long run is a misleading guide to current affairs			1

speaking after his team 's victory , mr @entity7 revealed that he had used the internet to finesse his quizzing skills ahead of filming - and suggested that @entity6 is not as intellectual as it might seem			1
' we 'd put aside regular times to sit down together in the college bar , watch past episodes on @entity30 and try to shout the answers at the telly before any of the contestants buzzed , ' he told the @entity12 and @entity13 website			1

' sometimes question - setters really like a particular area and they 'll keep coming back to it			0

next time it comes up , it wo n't be daunting any more			0
