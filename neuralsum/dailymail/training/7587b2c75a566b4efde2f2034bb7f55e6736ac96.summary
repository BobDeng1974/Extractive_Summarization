by @entity0 in @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 the mother of a childhood friend of virgin killer @entity7 has today told of her daughter 's ' total shock ' at being named in his bitter manifesto			1
@entity7 , 22 , first met the girl , the daughter of a @entity14 1980s popstar , when he moved to @entity4 aged five - but in his twisted rant he said she came to ' represent everything i hate and despise			1
' and clearly shaken , her mother told @entity20 at her home : ' it 's a nightmare , she 's shocked			1
the @entity7 family are very dear friends of ours			1
i can not believe what they are going through			2
they gave that boy everything			2
he was everything to them			0
' however , she added : ' our hearts are full of kindness and empathy for everyone affected			0
' in his manifesto , written shortly before he went on a rampage and killed six students at the @entity58 , @entity7 went on a tirade about the girl who was his first friend in @entity1			1
she is one of many girls , men and parents who @entity7 spewed hatred at as he wrote his sick manifesto in a twisted bid to justify his horrific actions			1
during their childhood , he claimed the pair were close , even sharing baths together as the two families socialised at parties and barbecues at each other ’s houses			2
but as the pretty blonde grew into a sociable college student , @entity7 became a troubled recluse			1
@entity7 wrote of the girl : ‘ i was a 5 year old boy playing with a girl my own age like any normal boy would do			1
‘ i was enjoying life in a world that i loved			0
i was happy , and completely oblivious of the fact that my future on this world would only turn to darkness and misery because of girls			2
‘ this girl who was my friend , ( she ) would eventually come to represent everything i hate and despise ; everything that is against me , and everything that i 'm against			1
i was playing innocently with this girl , in the manner that all children play			0
we even took baths together ; it was the only time in my life that i would see a girl my age naked			0
' enacting his ' revenge ' on society , @entity7 stabbed three of his housemates to death at his home before shooting dead two sorority sisters and another male student in @entity113 on friday			1
sick : @entity7 , 22 , stabbed three people in his home and shot dead three other students before he took his own life on friday			1
the rampage came after he posted rants online about how women hated him @entity120 - born @entity7 was raised in @entity121 , @entity122 , attending £ 18,000 - a - year prep school @entity123 , before moving to @entity4 with his parents , @entity127 director @entity126 and his ex-wife @entity125 , his former friend also emigrated to @entity1 as a child after her father hit the big time with his band			1
@entity7 , son of @entity127 assistant director @entity126 , regularly went to her home			1
the two stayed in touch through their families until august last year when she went to his house for dinner			1
however , he later stalked her on @entity142 and concluded that she and her friends at the @entity144 were ' spoiled			0
' he wrote : ' i would take great delight in torturing and flaying her and every single one of her spoiled , obnoxious , evil friends			0
' the girl 's stepfather also added : ' we are absolutely devastated			0
it is a tragedy that so many young lives have been lost			2
our thoughts are with their families			2
the @entity156 are good people			0
i knew @entity7 as well			1
it is just incredibly sad			0
' now i just want to protect my daughter and do what is best for her			0
' @entity7 , who had @entity162 , emailed his manifesto to his parents and his psychiatrist before going on the rampage in @entity113			1
first he stabbed to death his fellow students weihan @entity168 , 20 , and @entity169 , 20 , at their shared apartment			1
the body of another student , @entity174 , 19 , was also found there			2
his next victims were @entity177 , 19 , and @entity178 , 22 , both shot outside a student house near the campus			2
he then drove in his black @entity182 to a grocery store and opened fire , killing his sixth victim , @entity122 major @entity185 , 20			0
today , family friend and spokesman @entity187 said the @entity7 family are ' grieving for those innocents who lost their lives , above their own son '			1
mr @entity187 has spent the last few days with @entity125 , @entity126 and his second wife @entity193 and he says they are so upset they can ' barely string a sentence together '			0
dad : the killer wrote in his manifesto that he did n't want to kill his father , @entity126 , pictured left with his sister @entity201 , because he was n't sure he could follow through close : @entity201 and her mother @entity202 pictured on a recent vacation he said : ' they are absolutely crippled by grief			1
i know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in their company , because they are so distraught			0
it is hard to be near them because they are so devastated			0
' i can tell you that they are grieving for those who 've lost their lives before their own son			0
they really are , that 's where they are			0
i ca n't imagine the confusion there must be in that ? ' as well as launching a tirade against his childhood friend , @entity7 also branded model @entity231 an ' evil b * * * * ' and blamed her for his hatred of women			1
he claimed the stunning blonde ' teased and ridiculed ' him after they met at school , sparking his vendetta against female kind			1
' the way i was treated by girls at this time , especially by that evil b * * * * sparked an intense fear of girls , ' he wrote			2
' the funny part of this is that i had a secret crush on @entity250			0
she was the first girl i ever had a crush on , and i never admitted it to anyone however , @entity256 's father , @entity257 stuntman @entity255 , has defended his daughter , saying it is ridiculous to even suggest she played a part in @entity7 's spiral into a mass murderer			1
speaking from his home in @entity264 , @entity4 , he told @entity20 : ' she was ten years old for @entity266 's sake - she can barely remember the guy			1
she has n't seen him since school			2
' ' she 's devastated over the whole thing , ' he went on			0
' it 's like she 's being implicated in this terrible tragedy for something she has n't done and ca n't remember			0
' he added that @entity7 's claims that @entity256 had ' teased ' him were impossible			1
' how is a ten - year - old girl going to bully a 12 - year - old boy ? ' he asked			1
' maybe the girls she hung around with did poke fun at him , but they were kids			2
' my daughter was not a bully , she 's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet			0
she probably rejected his aggressive advances			0
if you want to call that bullying then fine			0
' mr @entity255 added that he and his daughter only remember @entity7 as a ' strange kid '			1
victims : @entity7 's first victims included his roommates @entity168 , left , and @entity169 , right gunned down : @entity174 , left , was also found stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - while @entity156 gunned down @entity301 , right , when he opened fire at a deli loss : @entity304 , left , and @entity305 were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot ' he was weird then and he 's weird now , ' he said			1
' he had a secret crush on her , but she was completely unaware of him			0
she had no idea ... if you think about it , he could have killed her , he could have come after her			0
' i was hands on at that school and i do n't remember him			2
she just remember that he was a strange kid , she knew he was n't a normal type person , but there are a lot of people like that at that age			0

he also had some sympathy for the killer			0
' i also feel sorry for him because he obviously was n't getting the proper help , ' he said			0
