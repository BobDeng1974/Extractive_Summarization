the @entity1 family were welcomed at @entity2 by burning effigies and mass fan protest			1
but that has not stopped them largely overseeing a spell of success on the pitch at @entity10 until last season 's setback			0
@entity13 endured a nightmare 10 months before being sacked in april but , with serial winner @entity15 now installed as replacement , @entity2 have one of @entity19 's most respected managers at the helm as they bid to recapture the glory days of sir @entity23 's time			1
executive vice chairman @entity24 has vowed to help get the club back on track after last season 's seventh place finish , with @entity29 expected to revitalise an ageing squad by spending big this summer			2
after the passing of @entity1 on wednesday and with another new era about to begin , @entity31 takes you through the nine years since the @entity35 completed their takeover			1
family matters : @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 are pictured at @entity10 last year @entity41 the @entity1 family , led by father @entity1 , began their pursuit of @entity2 in 2003 and completed a £ 790million takeover in may 2005			1
but it was met with huge opposition from fans and the deal went through to the backdrop of supporter protests after debt used to buy the club was put back on its balance sheet in what is known as a leveraged buyout			2
around 2,000 fans swarmed around @entity10 when the news was announced , burning effigies of @entity60 and season ticket forms , holding placards saying ' not for $ al £ ' and there was even a sit - down protest , blocking a main road to the stadium			2
unpopular : @entity2 fans hung an @entity69 banner as part of their green and gold protests of 2010 frustrated : united fans protest at the @entity74 ' ownership after the club was burdened with a large debt five men were arrested and two were charged with public order offences			1
a fan pressure group , @entity81 , was set up a year previously in an attempt to block the @entity1 family takeover			1
chairman @entity84 said at the time : ' i am very sad - i still love the club but i refuse to put a penny into the company			2
and i believe as many as 20,000 fans may also leave @entity2			1
' their attempts were futile and disaffected fans set up a new club @entity94 , now in the seventh tier of @entity97 football			2
opinionated : fans hold a ' @entity99 , @entity101 ' banner ahead of a @entity103 clash with @entity104 in 2005 running of the club in april 2006 , only a year after the purchase was complete , @entity1 suffered a stroke and the day - to - day running of the club was handed to two of his sons , @entity110 and @entity39			1
@entity111 never visited @entity10 once to watch the side in the entire time his family have been in charge			2
he had virtually nothing to do with running the club since the very beginning , and his six children – @entity110 , @entity39 , @entity118 , @entity38 , @entity119 and @entity120 – have had ownership of the family 's 90 per cent stake of club , with the other 10 per cent listed on the @entity125			1
staying away : @entity1 , who passed away aged 85 on wednesday , never visited @entity10 for a game success on the field despite the family 's unpopularity , space on the shelf in the @entity2 trophy cabinet has been steadily running out			1
in the nine years since they have been at the helm , the club have won 10 major trophies			1
five @entity103 titles – including three in a row between 2006 and 2009 – a @entity103 , three @entity138 and the @entity139			2
champions : sir @entity23 lifts the @entity142 trophy in 2013 before retiring from management until last season 's disastrous spell under @entity147 , when they ended the season in seventh , they have not finished outside the top two in the @entity74 ' tenure , coming second the other three times			0
the first campaign under their ownership was slow			0
@entity2 crashed out of the @entity103 in the first round , bottom of their group			2
they came second in the @entity142 , but did n't end the season empty - handed , picking up the @entity160			0
their first league win came in the second season , and they also got to the semi-final of the @entity103 and were runners up in the @entity165			0
two trophies followed the next season , in 2007 - 08			0
they won back - to - back league titles and @entity103			0
kings of @entity19 : @entity2 won their second @entity103 title with a penalty shootout victory against @entity173 in @entity174 in 2008 more followed the next year in one of the most competitive campaigns in the club 's history , fighting for silverware on seven fronts			1
they won a third successive league title , the @entity160 and @entity139 , they were runners up in the @entity103 and @entity184 , and were @entity165 semi-finalists			0
in the next four seasons @entity2 won the league twice and the @entity160 , before @entity13 took charge			1
the transfers the then world record sale of @entity191 to @entity192 for £ 80million in july 2009 is the most notable transfer in the @entity1 family reign			1
but when it comes to transfers they have hardly been the guy who miraculously ca n't find his wallet when it 's their round			0
@entity2 famously pinched @entity201 from rivals @entity202 for £ 24m in 2012			1
@entity203 came for £ 30.75m in 2008 and left for £ 5m four years later			0
exit : @entity2 sold @entity191 to @entity192 for a then world record of fee of £ 80million in 2009 that was a club record until the purchase of @entity209 from @entity173 for £ 37.1m in january , while they also shelled out £ 27.5m for @entity210 last season			1
they have welcomed @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			0
@entity216 , long - admired by sir @entity23 , joined the club , although he continued the lacklustre end to his career			0
the infamous @entity220 was brought in for £ 7.4m in 2010 and is somehow still a @entity2 player			1
bar the sale of @entity191 , the @entity74 have not been known to let their best players be taken by domestic and european rivals			2
big buy : the @entity74 financed @entity201 's £ 24million move from @entity202 to @entity10 in 2012 ageing stars @entity229 , admittedly a shock departure in 2005 , @entity227 and @entity228 were allowed to go			1
@entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 all retired			0
@entity235 even came back and retired again			0
one oversight was allowing @entity237 to leave for @entity238 , where he has since gone on to become one of the world 's best defenders			0
@entity242 joined the club on loan in 2007 but left to controversially sign for local rivals @entity245 two years later			0
big mistake : @entity2 allowed @entity237 to return to @entity238 for just £ 4million in 2008 managerial mistake perhaps the biggest error of the @entity74 ' ownership has been to allow @entity23 to appoint his own successor			1
although it is understandable why they put faith in the greatest manager in the game 's history to have a keen eye for who should follow him			0
@entity13 's 10 months in charge were nothing short of catastrophic			0
nightmare : @entity13 was sacked in april after a disastrous first season in charge at @entity2 it is unlikely he would boast about it , but the @entity267 did win the @entity268 in his first competitive fixture in charge			2
but exits in the quarter - final of the @entity103 , semi-final of the @entity160 and third round of the @entity165 and struggling even to make the @entity271 proved too much for the @entity74 to take			0
@entity2 are not exactly sinking yet , but they have certainly taken on some heavy water and the @entity35 owners will be hoping that tough taskmaster @entity29 will be able to steady the ship			1
new man : @entity280 coach @entity15 will take over the @entity10 hot - seat after the @entity139			0

@entity1 died aged 85 on wednesday
the @entity35 family bought @entity2 in 2005 amid *unrest* from supporters
@entity2 have won nine major trophies since the @entity1 family took control
@entity191 was sold for £ 80million to @entity192 in 2009
the club have invested in stars including @entity201 and @entity209
