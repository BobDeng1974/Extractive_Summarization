the dreaded phrase ' unexpected item in the bagging area ' could soon be a thing of the past at thousands of self - service checkouts in high street supermarkets around the @entity7 , according to a new report			1
for a new hi - tech camera system is being designed to end the necessity of the robotic message that sends @entity13 's time - strapped shoppers into a fury as it brings their transaction to a shuddering halt			0
trade magazine @entity17 reported yesterday that the shopping frustration breakthrough could come from the company that installed the @entity7 's first self - service checkout 12 years ago			1
this will allow the till to continue the checkout process without the need for a member of the store staff to intervene			0
@entity30 retail division 's general manager of self - checkout solutions , @entity48 , told @entity17 that the system was about a year away from being rolled out			2
he said : ' at the moment , the systems are generally quite one - dimensional and only work by recognising the weight of the products that are supposed to be in the bagging area			1
' it would really speed up the process if we had a camera which could quickly spot whether the extra weight was a customer 's purse rather than these false alarms			0
' as well as traditional self - scan systems , which are designed for smaller shopping trips , @entity30 has developed bigger systems that allow shoppers to place a full weekly shop on a conveyor belt and use 360 - degree scanners to process the full order at once			0
the technology is currently being trialled by @entity74 and @entity75 but mr @entity48 said it would be at least a further four or five years before such systems became commonplace in @entity7 supermarkets			1
a survey of @entity7 shoppers found that 89 per cent of consumers said they use self - checkouts to some degree , while 39 per cent of them either ' strongly agree ' or ' agree ' that retailers offering the technology provide better customer service .			2
