a gun range owner who banned @entity2 from her business as a matter of ' public safety ' claims trade has ' quadrupled ' since the controversial move			1
@entity8 decided to bar all followers of @entity10 from her @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , last september while claiming the religion ' commands them to kill ' her			1
five months on and she says business is booming and that threats of a lawsuit by federal civil rights enforcers have failed to materialise			1
the group 's attorney , @entity27 , said at the time the move could ' inevitably result in a hostile environment for ordinary @entity2 in @entity13			1
' but @entity8 has no plans to back down , despite receiving threats over the contentious decision , and even claims business has ' quadrupled ' with people coming from out of state and some offering donations for what they predict will be a legal battle			1
@entity8 claims keeping @entity2 out of her firing range is a matter of public safety and not a constitutional issue in a bizarre blog post , she wrote that she does n't consider @entity10 to be a religion — and as such @entity2 should n't be allowed protections under the @entity48 @entity47			1
' why would i want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me ? ' she added			0
the shooting range owner said she made the decision in september after two customers she deemed suspicious visited			0
she said their furtive behavior and cellphone ringtones of ' @entity60 ' prompted her to revise her range 's policies			0
@entity8 , who says she has been threatened before , wrote in a rambling blog post : ' why would i want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me ? ' @entity8 said she excludes those she believes to be muslim based on their names			1
' we are dealing in lethal firearms , ' @entity8 told @entity74			2
' i 'm not going to let a @entity76 shoot in here , or a @entity79 member in here , either			0
' she added in her blog that she believed the @entity82 contains ' 109 verses commanding hate , murder and terror , ' and claims threats on her life have been made by @entity2			1
earlier this month , a @entity91 father and son say they were turned away from the gun range			0
the men , of @entity97 descent , said they had arrived hoping to shoot but were immediately asked where they were from and told it was a muslim - free range			0
despite telling @entity8 they were @entity91 , the son , who did not want to be named , claims he and his father were still asked to leave			2
the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) of @entity13 has now petitioned federal authorities against @entity8 's decision			1
executive director @entity106 said the rule was religious discrimination and warned her group would be ' more than happy ' to proceed with legal action should a client approach them			1
@entity8 is the owner of the @entity113 ( pictured ) in @entity12 , @entity13 legal experts say @entity8 may be within her rights if her gun range is deemed a private club			1
however , they warned that a gun range open to the general public but excluding @entity2 could struggle to prove it does not fall under federal civil rights regulation			2
@entity8 cited the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , and the @entity123 bombings as some of the reasons she mistrust @entity2			1
@entity8 said some of her patrons were ' frightened ' when two men with ' @entity60 ring tone and message alert tones ' — the @entity132 phrase meaning ' @entity133 is the greatest ' — walked into her range recently			2
' they spoke very little @entity136 , one did not have proof of @entity48 citizenship , yet they wanted to rent and shoot , ' @entity8 wrote			1
' they were constantly glancing toward the cameras in the range , then looking at each other and speaking in their own language			0
' their behavior was so strange , it frightened my patrons			0
no one would enter the range to shoot while they were there			0
some of my customers left			0
i lost business and the people who remained at my facility said they did so out of fear for my safety			0
' @entity8 was unavailable for comment when sought by @entity161 on thursday evening			2
the @entity162 has asked the @entity48 @entity163 to investigate @entity8 ( pictured ) on ground of racial and religious discrimination in a phone call , an employee at @entity113 said @entity8 is considering changing her business into a private shooting club			1
' as such , we can say who may or may not be a member , ' the staffer said			0
' we do n't ask anybody what their religion is , we do n't care			2
' they come in here and act normal , we do n't have a problem			0
' bizarrely , @entity8 seems to justify her @entity10 - free idea on the advice of agents from the federal @entity184			1
she claims two agents told her ' if we feel any reason for concern about selling someone a firearm , even sense that something is not right about an individual , or if we are concerned about that [ person 's ] mental state , even if they pass a background check , we do not have to sell that person a gun			0
she added : ' i understand that not all muslims are terrorists			0
i also believe there are as many @entity2 who do not know what is in their @entity82 as there are @entity202 who do not know what is in their @entity204			2
' since i have no way of discerning which @entity2 will or will not kill in the name of their religion and the commands in their koran , i choose to err on the side of caution for the safety of my patrons			2
' the @entity162 sent a copy of its letter to @entity13 gov. @entity217 , the @entity218 of the @entity163 , the @entity48 attorney for the @entity219 of @entity13 and the @entity184 's regional office in @entity221			1
responding to the letter , she wrote in her @entity225 page : ' i 've been a target of @entity227 threats for five years			0
. fully expecting at any time one of them to follow through with the threat			0
i may go down for speaking the truth about @entity10 ... … i may lose everything i have , ( which is n't much ) but they ca n't take my integrity ... this is a mountain i 'm willing to die on …			2
