by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:01 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 4 january 2013 when @entity6 the golden labrador vanished during a @entity8 walk at a beauty spot , his desperate owner believed he had run away			1
@entity10 turned to the internet to try to track him down , creating a ‘ missing ’ poster of the family pet and circulating it on @entity14 and @entity15			1
in fact , @entity6 had not wandered off but had fallen down a narrow , heather - covered 6ft - deep crevice yards from where he was last seen and was unable to move			1
@entity6 vanished at 2.30pm on @entity8 , but lay face down in the hole undiscovered for about 47 hours			1
six hours later , @entity6 ( pictured here peeking out ) was freed rescued : @entity21 back home after he was pulled to safety from a deep crevice but mr @entity10 ’s @entity14 appeal still paid off – after another dog owner saw it and successfully took his own pet to the spot to search for @entity6			1
there then followed a nine - hour rescue operation in which firemen carefully drilled through the rock and eventually pulled the bedraggled dog to safety 53 hours after he vanished			1
the dog was plucked - cold , wet and muddy - from the 6ft deep , 5in wide crevice in @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , by firefighters who had spent almost nine hours drilling through rocks to free him			1
more than 40 people had gathered at the scene and cheered and applauded when the disappearing dog , @entity6 , was finally freed			1
the 18 - month - old pet had vanished at 2.30pm on @entity8 , but lay face down in the hole undiscovered for about 47 hours			2
he was eventually found at about 1pm on thursday by a kind - hearted dog lover , @entity51 , and his border collie @entity52			2
time for walkies : @entity6 has recovered well and is back on his feet ready for another adventure moments after @entity6 was released at 7.50pm , owner @entity10 said : ' i am so enthralled to have him back - i 'm ready for a beer			2
' thank you so much to everyone who has helped these past couple of days			2
' daughter @entity60 , 17 , said : ' it is absolutely amazing , i can not thank the firemen enough			2
i am so relieved - it is just a dream			2
' the drama began when mr @entity10 was kicking a football around with @entity6 and his twin sister @entity67			2
mr @entity10 said he turned his head briefly after kicking the ball for the dogs , but when he turned back round @entity6 had vanished			2
scared @entity6 had been pinched or fallen down a hill chasing a squirrel , mr @entity10 frantically searched the area but could not find the much - loved dog before darkness fell at about 5pm			1
desperate , mr @entity10 posted @entity6 's plight on @entity14 , before notifying police , the dog warden and animal rescue			1
pictures of @entity6 were also put on @entity83 's @entity14 page			1
the centre is run by @entity85 , partner of @entity51 , who took an afternoon off work to help search for @entity6			0
mr @entity10 , from @entity39 , said : ' after that it just took off , it was massive			0
it ended up all over @entity15 as well			1
' one of mr @entity10 's neighbours , @entity92 , heard what was going on and asked her partner - @entity94 - a former @entity95 rugby league star - to post a plea to his 21,000 followers on @entity15			1
but despite reported sightings , mr @entity10 was beginning to give up hope			0
however , he said : ' i had an inkling and went down to the @entity38 again , where i met @entity51			0
' found : @entity6 was rescued after being stuck for 53 hours after falling into a deep crevice more than 40 people gathered at the scene and cheered and applauded when the disappearing dog , @entity6 , was finally freed mr @entity10 and mr @entity51 had never met before , but the latter had decided to bring his dog up to help search for @entity6			1
' @entity52 likes sniffing around , ' said mr @entity51			0
' she came to the exact spot first of all , but it was just thick heather			0
after another look around , she came back to the same spot - she knew something was here			0
' i scraped back the heather and saw the back end of a dog			0
i knew that if the dog was here , @entity52 would find it - and she did			0
' mr @entity10 said : ' i am so , so grateful for all the help			0
i can not put into words how brilliant people have been			0
' @entity21 with @entity126 ( left ) the dog that helped find him his wife , @entity129 , told how @entity6 was a member of the family and shouted her thanks to everyone when the dog was rescued			1
but she added : ' we have lived around here for nearly 30 years , but never knew of these holes under the heather			0
' it could have been a small child that fell down there			1
' watch commander @entity142 , of @entity144 fire station , led a team of 11 firefighters in the technical rescue unit on the operation			0
he said : ' they were great			0
a good outcome is the main thing			0
we are relieved the dog is out successfully and it looks like it is going to be ok			0
' @entity6 was rushed off to the vets ' for a check - up immediately after the drama			0
mr @entity10 , his wife @entity159 and their five children thanked everyone involved in the operation , especially mr @entity51 , who refused to accept the £ 1,000 reward on offer for @entity6 ’s return			0
@entity6 fell down a crevice in @entity38 , near @entity168			1
