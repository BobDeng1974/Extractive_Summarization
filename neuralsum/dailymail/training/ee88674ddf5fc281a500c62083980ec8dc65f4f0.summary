' well , to be honest , ' the email reads , ' with all the chaos and excitement that ensued with @entity14 coming home from the hospital with hospice			0
' @entity3 - @entity3 , who now appears in the series @entity42 , says the hoax was convincing because it did n't initially ask for anything or seem all that interested in her as a celebrity			1

' but she was n't dying to get a hold of me			0
you know , that was kind of the beginning of the manipulation			0
' for ten days , the couple exchanged dozens of emails , texts , and phones calls according to @entity80			2
the con artist even sent a journal entry in what appears to be children 's handwriting			2
from the entry , which is filled with apparently fake spelling errors : ' my kim i am not scard to die now you filled up my heart with so much love i am sad to leve you because no body can make me smile like you do			0
' a smiling sun is drawn in crayon at the bottom : ' love your claire			0

' you 're singing to someone 's dying kid , ' he says			0
' and in the middle of it , there 's no way that 's not real			2

' every red flag went up that i could n't ask a simple question			0
' in an episode to air wednesday , @entity17 speaks to the couple , whose ordeal ended there			1
but the worst part , they say , is that the woman used photographs plucked from a website of an actual little girl dying of neuroblastoma			0
' that 's the sickest part about this to me , ' @entity2 said			0
' that is the part that when i start to talk about that , that 's when i get really mad			0
