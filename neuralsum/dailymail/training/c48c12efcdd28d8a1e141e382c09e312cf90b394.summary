the unnamed husband and wife inherited the damaged vase from the woman 's late father and were ' completely oblivious ' about is origin and value			1
they emailed an auction house photos of some ' modest ' antiques they were considering selling , including one of the 16 inch tall pea green vase			1
and an expert immediately identified the porcelain vase as unique and made in the 18th century for one of the palaces of the @entity27			1

' he would have paid an unremarkable sum for it because he never hinted that it was valuable			0
' the vendors were completely oblivious to its significance			0
' they stored dried flowers in it and tucked it away in the corner of their lounge			0
' i was scrolling through eight or nine emails including theirs and suddenly a picture of this vase appeared			0
it was obvious that it was a very high quality piece			0
' i picked up the phone straight away and left a message to say that i thought it could be special , despite the chips and damage to it			0
' a couple of days later the couple brought the vase in a box wrapped in bubble wrap			2
as soon as i unpacked it it was quite apparent they had a very valuable piece			0
