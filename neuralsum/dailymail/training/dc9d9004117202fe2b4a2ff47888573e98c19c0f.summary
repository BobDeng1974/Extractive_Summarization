there is no @entity72 with three @entity40 named @entity15 listed on any official record			0

' i served in @entity1 and have several friend who were seriously wounded and a couple who were killed in action who wore that same uniform and to see someone try and claim that type of sacrifice really irked me , ’ said @entity10			0
