by @entity0 a father who suffered from a mysterious agonising skin condition for two years has found it was caused by a banned toxic sofa he bought on @entity5			1
@entity6 , 56 , was delighted with his new reclining leather armchair , but had no idea it was from a highly poisonous batch of furniture that was also sold by @entity12 and the now - defunct @entity13			1
@entity12 has recalled all the furniture , and in 2010 contributed along with 13 other companies to paying out £ 20million to customers who suffered painful burns			1
poisoned : @entity6 56 , had been poisoned by a chair he bought on @entity5 two years ago but mr @entity6 's case highlights there is a risk some sofas still exist , and are even being resold second - hand			1
@entity12 is now investigating to see if the seller had previously received compensation and knowingly resold the toxic sofa			1
for two years , mr @entity6 suffered painful sores and an itchy rash all over his body , but he had no idea what had caused it			1
he told his doctor : ' my whole body feels like it is on fire			0
' mr @entity6 , a father - of - five , was referred to a specialist who told him he had been into contact with a dangerously toxic substance			1
the property maintenance manager then discovered his armchair was from the batch of toxic chairs			2
the burns from the sofa were so severe mr @entity6 fell into a depression embarrassed : he said he was forced to hide his arms and legs for fear of offending people the black leather recliner armchair had been withdrawn from shops after complaints of allergic reactions			1
but the @entity5 seller had failed to give mr @entity6 any warning when he bought it using the online auction website			1
mr @entity6 said : ' every time i sat in that chair it was poisoning my body and i did n’t have a clue			2
' the leather chair made my skin go all prickly and hot , i could n’t stop scratching , it was like someone had set me on fire			2
' the last two years of my life have been absolutely horrific			2
i ca n’t put into words what i ’ve been through because of this chair			0
' i ’ve been so distressed with non-stop scratching that i ended up on anti-depressants			0
' i have my own business and i have to cover my arms with bandages because i am so embarrassed at customers seeing the sores			0
' i can no longer take my daughter swimming because i would n’t dream of letting anyone seem my body looking like this			0
' now the sofa has been identified as the cause of his suffering , mr @entity6 has removed it from his house and his skin is starting to improve mr @entity6 bought the chair off @entity5 and travelled down to @entity91 to pick it up from the seller			1
he developed a rash after returning the recliner to his home in @entity97 , @entity98 , but did not realise his chair was causing it - until solving the mystery after 18 months			0
no one else in his family was affected because it was his personal chair			0
mr @entity6 ’s gp confessed he ’d never seen anything like his rash before			2
he was prescribed steroid cream and referred to a dermatologist			0
he then realised his desperate need to scratch got worse when he sat in his favourite black leather recliner armchair			0
mr @entity6 went online - and discovered the chair was of the same sort withdrawn from circulation after a court action against @entity12 and other retailers which resulted in a £ 20million legal action over the poisonous furniture			1
he added : ' i bought the chair off @entity5 for £ 80			0
i did n’t have a clue this chair was going to cause me untold misery and distress			0
' @entity12 needs to get a warning out there , these toxic chairs are still out there and being sold to unsuspecting victims			1
' thousands of people like me may be suffering terribly , and not knowing why			0
just be careful what you buy on @entity5			0
' the settees and chairs sold between £ 600 and £ 850 had been treated with a fungicide to stop them going mouldy in storage			0
they had been treated with @entity139 - a substance that has triggered violent irritant - related eczema in some people			0
it is so toxic that those who come into contact with it should wear protective clothing and glasses			0
mr @entity6 has since put the chair in the garage - and his skin allergy is slowly disappearing			1
in a statement to the @entity155 , an @entity12 spokeswoman said : ' as a responsible retailer we were extremely concerned to learn of the problems mr @entity6 has experienced with the chair he purchased second - hand 18 months ago and our priority is conducting an urgent investigation into this matter			1
' we have offered to collect the chair from mr @entity6 ’s home for testing , however , he has declined to release it			2
we have also asked mr @entity6 for details of the seller from which he purchased the chair so that we can cross reference this with our archive orders			1
' without this information we are unable to pursue the investigation further and we urge mr @entity6 to assist with our requests so that we can try and resolve this serious situation for him as quickly as possible			2

@entity6 suffered from an agonising skin condition for two years
doctors were baffled by the horrific burns and he fell into a depression
he has now found it was caused by a banned toxic substance in the sofa
furniture from the same batch was sold by @entity12 , @entity191 and others
@entity12 said it is now investigating if the seller *originally* bought it from them
