@entity1 ’s stunning free - kick nine minutes from time spared @entity3 from the ignominy of drawing with minnow principality @entity5 and sparked a pitch invasion from travelling fans			1
the @entity10 star struck a brilliant shot that curled into the net and then sent over-exuberant supporters back to their seats after they had crashed over an advertising hoarding to celebrate			1
he had earlier scored a soaring header to equalise an opening penalty from @entity5 , their first competitive goal in more than four years			1
the 3g surface would cause awkward rolls and spray black rubber pellets when the ball bounced			0
‘ i ca n't describe how bad , bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with , ’ he said			0
his brace bailed out @entity44 who would have faced serious recriminations with defeat here in @entity3 ’s opening @entity55 qualifier			1
this entire nation ’s population could fit inside the 85,000 - capacity @entity117 for @entity10 ’s derby against @entity120 on saturday , which is where @entity1 now heads			1
@entity121 will be relieved the heavy challenges from @entity5 ’s team did not do harm to his player , but @entity66 paid a price , limping off with an ankle injury that makes him a doubt for @entity67 ’s match with @entity130 on saturday			1
‘ he got kick and twist , ’ said @entity44			1
‘ hopefully he 'll be ok for @entity67 at the weekend but we 'll have to see what the next 24 - 48 hours holds			0
’ @entity44 described the pitch as ‘ not up to standard of a @entity138 qualifier ’ and added : ‘ i think we showed hell of a lot of courage			1
’ he paid tribute to @entity1			1
‘ there are only two players in the world , @entity146 and @entity1 , who could have done something like that tonight , ’ said @entity44			1
‘ @entity1 was absolutely magnificent			2
’ before the match @entity151 , manager of @entity10 ’s b side , had spoken about the ‘ tragedy ’ it would be were his club colleague @entity1 not perform for at a major international tournament			1
‘ he is one of the top five players in the world - for him not to be there is just wrong , ’ said the @entity157 @entity156 winner			0
so it was with a dollop of irony that in the build - up to @entity5 ’s goal in the sixth minute @entity1 was dumfounded by a @entity151 turn by a part - timer			1
@entity80 dragged the ball skillfully to swerve round his more illustrious opponent and eventually @entity5 won a throw - in			2
from there @entity75 flicked it on and @entity83 fell under pressure from @entity93			0
at first @entity100 referee @entity99 waved away the hosts ’ appeals but seconds later had pointed to the spot after a signal from fifth official @entity178 behind the goal			2
it looked a soft penalty but @entity93 had grabbed @entity83 ’s shirt			0
captain @entity33 , a 34 - year - old defender , stepped up in front of the vocal travelling support and calmly sent @entity87 the wrong way			2
@entity5 had taken the lead and it was incomprehensible			2
the numbers told you that			0
for a nation ranked 199 in the world – who have lost their last 44 competitive games , and only won one in their history – this was their first competitive goal in four years			1
on the run : attacking midfielder @entity66 attempts to dribble past @entity5 's @entity75 , @entity82 , @entity80 and @entity74 injury concern : @entity66 , who limped off against @entity5 , is a doubt for @entity67 's match against @entity130 on saturday view from the bench : @entity66 , who has his right ankle strapped , and several of his @entity3 team - mates watch the final minutes of the @entity55 qualifier displeased : @entity3 manager @entity44 , who saw his star midfielder @entity66 limp off with an injury , was unhappy with the state of the pitch quiet atmosphere : the match was played out in front of a small crowd at the @entity214 in @entity215 tricky task : @entity3 ' players such as @entity93 , pictured , had to get used to playing on an artificial pitch high challenge : @entity3 and @entity220 midfielder @entity94 competes for the ball after coming on for church dodgy surface : @entity1 said the surface in @entity5 was the worst he 's ever played on during his competitive career mission complete : two - goal hero @entity1 salutes the @entity3 fans after the final whistle of his side 's @entity55 opener relieved : @entity1 is all smiles at the final whistle after his late free - kick wins his side all three points against @entity5 it was not so much a roar that went up in this tiny stadium holding 3,300 , mostly @entity63 , people			1
but the echoes could be heard as they travelled up the surrounding mountains			0
a picturesque setting , a nightmarish scenario for @entity44			2
@entity1 responded as he has done countless times			2
first he headed narrowly over from @entity68 ’s corner and then in the 22nd minute found an equaliser that brought much relief			0
@entity89 produced a superb deep ball from the left and @entity1 rose as high as his athletic frame allows and glanced a brilliant header into the far corner			0
his primal celebration showed how much his country means to him			0
that continued after the interval			0
in the 57th minute @entity1 struck a trademark dipping free - kick that goalkeeper @entity30 punched clear and whipped a perfect cross with his weaker foot that @entity91 failed to reach fully			0
it was not all one way , though			0
slack play from @entity66 allowed @entity79 a run and shot at goal that flew wide			1
as the minutes ticked down it looked like a seismic shock was stirring			0
but @entity1 came up with the goods			0

@entity10 star @entity1 saved the day by netting late winner against @entity35 minnows @entity5
@entity33 stunned @entity3 by scoring opener from the penalty spot after just six minutes
@entity5 scored their first competitive goal since september 2010 against @entity44 's side
@entity44 was not happy with the state of the pitch at the @entity214 in @entity215
@entity3 midfielder @entity66 was forced off with an injury *due* to the quality of the surface
