by @entity0 published : 21:31 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 8 april 2013 the price of a first class stamp could soar to £ 1 in just three years if @entity5 is privatised , a group campaigning against the move has said the price of a first class stamp could soar to £ 1 in just three years if @entity5 is privatised , campaigners claim			1
save our @entity5 - set up by charities and pensioner groups to fight the expected sell off - said the cost would increase because other companies would be able to challenge @entity5 's vat - free status under competition law			1
bankers and government ministers are paving the way for a @entity5 flotation			1
it is believed it could happen as early as the @entity22			2
stamps are exempt from vat but lawyers have warned that if the @entity5 is privatised , this exemption will be challenged – almost certainly successfully – by other delivery companies			1
the price of sending a first class letter last year rose from 46p to 60p - an increase of 30 per cent			1
if 20 per cent vat was added the price would increase to 72p			1
a further rise of 30 per cent would see the stamp cost 94p by 2015			2
the group has warned that even if @entity24 were not applied , the price of sending a first class letter would ' likely hit £ 1 in three / four years , assuming two increases in that period ' , @entity34 reports			1
@entity38 , a @entity39 mp and member of the @entity41 and @entity42 - which oversees the work of @entity5 - told the paper it was essential that the services currently enjoyed by the public can be guaranteed , before the government rushes into selling off the group			1
he added : ' this should include a very careful look at how future price rises will adversely affect businesses as well as people in counties like @entity54			2
' bankers and government ministers are paving the way for a @entity5 flotation			1
it is believed it could happen as early as the @entity22 a business , innovations and @entity42 spokesman said the @entity5 will continue to be the designated universal service provider regardless of its ownership			1
they added that any change would not ' trigger a change in the current vat exemption which applies to first and second class stamps as part of the one price , anywhere service			1
' the @entity5 can trace its origins to 1516 , when @entity74 established the office of master of the @entity77 - a rudimentary postal service			1
but the monarch and his courtiers were the only ones allowed to use it			2
in 1635 , a @entity84 merchant called @entity85 asked @entity86 for permission to run a proper state postal monopoly , open to ordinary people as well as the rich and powerful			2
the @entity90 was founded in 1660 by @entity91 during the @entity95 , at the first @entity90 in central @entity94 , @entity93 ’s men set up a secret room where letters were opened , copied and resealed			0
roundhead agents pored over the nation ’s letters , looking out for any signs of dissent			0
after the war the service was returned to the public			0
by the time of @entity108 @entity107 , in 1837 , the @entity90 had become a crucial part of @entity111 ’s booming industrial landscape , with sub-post offices the hub of @entity115 communities			0
the @entity5 was once so vital to daily life , that post men delivered up to six times a day			1
a spokesman for @entity120 declined to comment on speculation			0
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' stamp prices , whether set under public or private ownership , are subject to significant competitive pressures			1
' customers have many alternatives to the post and there are now many postal providers			0
it is pure speculation to suggest that stamp prices could reach £ 1 in the next few years – in fact in 2013 there was no increase in the price of first class or second class stamps			1
' @entity111 stamp prices are among the best value in the @entity141			0
in some cases , the @entity111 is the cheapest			0
' the spokesman added : ' clearly , the rules governing the implementation of @entity24 are a matter for @entity120 not @entity5			1
' vat exemptions for core postal service delivery products such as stamps , by @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , are in place in the vast majority of @entity141 countries under the @entity154			2
' under the @entity155 is the @entity150 in the @entity111			0
the vat exemption would apply regardless of whether @entity5 was in public or private ownership			1
similar vat exemptions are in place for @entity150 products in @entity161 , @entity162 and the @entity163			2
in each country the @entity150 is privately owned			0
' @entity165 is backed by the @entity166 and the @entity167 , among others			2
the postal union the @entity169 is believed to have contributed towards the cost of the campaign group 's website			0
it will be launched today			0
the @entity169 said in a statement : ' privatisation often leads to higher prices , fewer services , and lower standards			0
it also risks a ' race to the bottom ' when it comes to jobs , with redundancies and lower terms and conditions			0
' this would be disastrous for postal workers and postal services			0
it would be a major step backwards , not an improvement			0
' at @entity169 we believe that @entity5 can be a successful company and remain in public ownership ; protecting valuable postal services for all communities			2
we do n't believe there are convincing arguments linking privatisation with greater success and we would like to see continued innovation under public ownership			0
' over the past five years the volume of letters sent every day has fallen by 10 million as people increasingly rely on other methods of communication such as email .			0
