staring confidently into the camera , these are the men who have made millions putting ‘ profits before welfare ’ with their infamous @entity3 website			1
yesterday , brothers @entity6 and @entity8 , who are pictured with one of their tech - savvy partners , were in hiding , each refusing to discuss their website ’s role in @entity15 ’s suicide on friday			1
but a whistleblower who worked at the site ’s headquarters in @entity19 , @entity20 ’s capital , claims his former bosses are aware of the harm caused by @entity3 but are more interested in the £ 5million a year they are making in advertising revenue			1
pressure : partners , from left , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 of the @entity3 website , but despite an open letter released today they have n't agreed to be interviewed he told the @entity33 : ‘ they do n’t care what happens to the children			1
no one in this project cares			2
‘ they have more than enough resources to moderate the site and get rid of the vile things that are written			2
‘ they believe the site ’s popularity is down to the fact some young people want to write anonymously about others			2
‘ and they believe if they closed down that facility then they would lose customers and therefore money			2
’ the site provides the perfect opportunity for ‘ trolling ’ because contact with users can be made anonymously			0
the website claims to have ‘ 50 moderators monitoring 30 million questions and answers a day ’ but the whistleblower , who does not wish to be named , said he ‘ never saw any moderation ’			1
misery : the controversial @entity3 website which has been blamed for the deaths of four @entity67 children ‘ most of the users are teenagers , ’ he said			1
‘ it is believed that teenagers find it easier to ask questions if they are able to do so anonymously			0
‘ but this anonymity has created a place where anyone can write nasty and dirty things about children			0
‘ that really bothered me and that is why i left the company			0
‘ there is a philosophy that the internet should be completely free from regulation but it has gone too far at @entity3			1
‘ while i worked there we became aware that some teenagers had committed suicide because of things that were said on the site , but still the bosses refused to do anything			1
‘ they have put profits before welfare			0
’ victim : @entity15 , 14 , has killed herself after being bullied by anonymous trolls online			1
@entity3 bosses have refused to discuss their website 's part in her death party - loving founders @entity6 and @entity8 are the sons of a wealthy former @entity107 @entity106 officer and they used family money to bankroll the online enterprise in 2010 before being joined by three partners with technical knowledge – @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
they copied the format of a successful @entity119 question and answer network to create @entity3			1
initially it limped along employing a handful of technical staff until 2011 , when the site took off almost overnight			0
in less than two years it has become a global social networking sensation and now has over 60 million registered users worldwide and is raking in at least £ 16,000 a day in advertising revenue			1
they moved into state - of - the - art offices in the heart of @entity20 ’s capital and employed teams of highly - trained computer technicians			0
@entity134 and good - looking , the brothers are described as ‘ inseparable ’			0
a friend said : ‘ @entity6 and @entity8 are always together and share a love of the good life			1
’ the older of the brothers @entity139 , 35 , is ceo and lives in an opulent home in the trendy coastal resort of @entity144 , some 20 miles from the capital			0
@entity6 , 29 , lives in an upmarket apartment in the centre of @entity19 and has only recently settled down after years of ‘ serious partying ’			1
he has recently become engaged to a glamorous @entity149 , @entity150 , who is from @entity151			0
last year @entity6 attracted huge criticism for comments he made following the death of two @entity156 teenagers , @entity157 , 15 , and @entity158 , 13 , who both committed suicide after suffering abuse on the @entity3 site			1
he claimed : ‘ of course there is a problem with cyber-bullying in social media			0
under fire : @entity167 faced criticism over comments he made last year regarding the deaths of @entity158 , left , and @entity157 , right ‘ but as far as we can see we only have this problem in @entity173 and in the @entity67 most of all , trust me			2
‘ there are no complaints regarding cyber-bullying from parents , children or other sources in other countries			0
‘ it seems that children are crueller in these countries ( @entity173 and the @entity67 )			0
’ he later said : ‘ it ’s not about the site , the problem is about education , about moral values that were devaluated lately			0
‘ @entity3 is just a tool which helps people to communicate with each other , same as any other social network , same as phone , same as piece of paper and pen , ’ he wrote			2
@entity8 also told a @entity198 journalist : ‘ kids lack attention , mainly because parents are doing other things such as watching tv , drinking beer and reading the tabloids			2
‘ when they come to sites like these , they start trolling themselves so that their peers start protecting them			0
in this absurd way , they get the attention			0

@entity6 and @entity8 are refusing to discuss @entity3 's role in @entity15 's suicide
but a whistleblower claims they are aware of the *potential* harm caused by the website
he says they are more interested in the £ 5million a year in advertising revenue
