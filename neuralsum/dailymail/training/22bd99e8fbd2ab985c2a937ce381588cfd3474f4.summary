by @entity1 reporter @entity2 is rolling out a program that would allow its workers to earn an online college degree at @entity6 at a steeply discounted rate			1
the coffee chain is partnering with the school to offer the option to 135,000 @entity12 employees who work at least 20 hours a week			1

@entity2 is rolling out a program that would allow its workers to earn an online college degree at @entity6 , pictured , at a steeply discounted rate the company says the program does n't require workers to stay at @entity2 after they earn their degrees			1
they can also pick from a wide range of educational programs that are n't related to their @entity2 work			1
@entity2 ceo @entity29 is scheduled to announce the program monday in @entity31 , with @entity12 education secretary @entity32 and about 340 workers and their family members in attendance			1
it 's not clear how many workers will choose to participate in the new program or how much it will cost @entity2 the company is n't disclosing the financial terms of its agreement with @entity6			1
but the program could significantly boost the enrollment for @entity6 's online program , which charges tuition of about $ 10,000 a year			2
the coffee chain is partnering with the school to offer the option to 135,000 @entity12 employees who work at least 20 hours a week that 's roughly the same as the school 's traditional degree program			1
tuition reimbursement is a rare benefit for low - wage workers in the retail industry , but @entity2 is n't the first to offer it			2
in 2010 , @entity58 launched a partnership with @entity60 , a for - profit , online school , to give workers and family members partial tuition grants			0
the retailer , based in @entity67 , @entity68 , says more than 400 of its workers have since completed degrees through the program			0
@entity58 's program also does not require workers to stay and allows them to pursue a variety of degrees			1
@entity2 ' existing tuition reimbursement program , which was rolled out in 2011 , gives workers up to $ 1,000 a year for courses at @entity78 or @entity79			2
tuition for an online degree at @entity6 is about $ 10,000 a year , roughly the same for its traditional educational programs			1
for the freshmen and sophomore years , @entity2 and @entity6 say they will put around $ 6,500 on average toward the estimated $ 20,000 in total tuition			2
to cover the remaining $ 13,500 , workers would apply for financial aid			0
if a worker qualified for a full @entity93 grant of $ 5,730 a year — or $ 11,460 over the two years — he or she would theoretically be left with about $ 2,040 to pay out of pocket			0
so far , @entity2 has paid out $ 6.5 million under that program , said @entity96 , a company spokeswoman			0
@entity97 , a 31 - year - old @entity2 employee and union organizer in @entity99 , @entity100 , said she thought the program might be useful to some workers			2
but she noted that prospective employers also look at where a degree was earned , and that actual in - class experience matters			0
as with most matters involving financial aid , the terms of the new program are somewhat complicated and will vary depending on each worker 's situation			0

to cover the remaining $ 13,500 , workers would apply for financial aid			0
since @entity2 workers do n't earn a lot of money , many would likely qualify for a @entity93 grant , said @entity124 , publisher of @entity125 , a website about paying for college			1
if a worker qualified for a full @entity93 grant of $ 5,730 a year — or $ 11,460 over the two years — he or she would theoretically be left with about $ 2,040 to pay out of pocket			0
the program would work similarly for the junior and senior years , except that @entity2 would reimburse any money workers end up having to pay out of pocket			1
@entity2 said most of its workers have already started school , so could potentially finish off their degrees at no cost if they applied for the program			1
the company says the program will be available to workers at its other chains as well , including @entity146 tea shops and @entity147			0
the program is available only to workers at @entity2 ' 8,200 company - operated locations			2
another 4,500 @entity12 locations are operated by franchisees			0
@entity124 said the new program at @entity2 has the potential to benefit all parties involved			0
workers will get a chance to earn a degree in a relatively affordable way , and @entity2 could attract a better pool of workers			1
@entity6 will also have a major employer potentially sending lots of students its way			0
" it 's a way to expand revenue , " he said of the online programs offered by traditional , brick - and - mortar universities			0
enrollment for @entity6 's online program already stands at around 10,000			2
