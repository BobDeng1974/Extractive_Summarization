by @entity0 published : 00:46 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 22 april 2013 does the man who took one of the steepest , most public falls from grace in recent sports history have a new career path in the works ? possibly , but judging from his trepidation about playing the drums for an @entity13 , @entity12 audience of 10,000 people , disgraced cyclist @entity8 wo n’t be moving on to the music world any time soon			1
the founder of the @entity17 took to @entity18 to tell what fans he has left what it felt like to play the drums at a recent reggae festival in his hometown			1
to clarify , @entity8 shared the stage that night with a reggae group that cribbed its name from the former @entity39 champ , known as @entity40			1
‘ drumming in front of 10,000 peeps had me more than a little freaked , ’ he went on to tell his nearly 4 million followers			0
the @entity44 reports @entity8 played four songs with the playfully named group , including @entity48 's 1982 hit ‘ pass the @entity49			1
’ @entity8 ’s dance card , or drum card , rather , is likely quite empty these days compared to the hectic schedule he once kept as a successful businessman and the world ’s foremost cyclist			0
once a common sight on magazine covers and the @entity60 social scene , the cancer survivor has kept a low profile since his tell - all interview with @entity63 last january in which he admitted to using performance enhancing drugs to help him win all seven of his @entity39 championships			0
nervous : @entity8 appeared jittery before his performance to a crowd of 10,000 and tweeted his apprehensions relief : before long , though , the fallen champion looked very comfortable in his unlikely new role since then , the former athlete ’s name has mainly been tied to negative media headlines			2
facing several multi-million dollar lawsuits , many speculated @entity8 ’s april sale of his 7,850 - square - foot mansion in @entity13 was at least partially a bid to defer mounting legal costs			1
also this month , @entity8 , who is banned for life from competing in any @entity87 sport , was preparing to race in a swimming competition that did not test its entrants for performance enhancing drugs			0
upon learning of @entity8 ’s intention , the @entity92 banned him from the event and from all future events that lay within their purview			0
competitive sports , it seems , are not likely to be part of @entity8 ’s future			0
so , perhaps a new life as a reggae drummer is a smart choice for @entity8 , if a rather odd one .			2

the disgraced athlete played drums on four songs at an april 20 @entity13 reggae festival with a group called @entity40
