@entity0 admits it is becoming difficult for @entity3 players to come to terms with recent refereeing decisions which have gone against the club			1
the @entity3 ' skipper was sent off in the 3 - 1 reverse to @entity9 on monday night after seeing his side have two legitimate penalty claims turned away by referee @entity12			1
@entity13 was lucky to avoid conceding a first - minute penalty when he brought down @entity15 , with @entity16 tangling with @entity17 in what could have been easily given as a spot - kick			2
video : scroll down for @entity22 's views on his side 's penalty claims on monday night @entity0 ( left ) was shown a second yellow card for a challenge on @entity27 late in the match @entity0 is sent off by referee @entity12 for his second bookable offence of the night the @entity3 skipper leaves the pitch at @entity32 on what was a miserable night for the home night as it turned out neither were given and @entity35 put the @entity9 ahead before the break and , despite @entity3 drawing level courtesy of a @entity40 own goal , @entity27 and @entity35 struck either side of @entity0 's red card to seal a second @entity44 win of the campaign			1
' i think we gave them two soft goals , ' said @entity0			2
' apart from that i thought we were really good			0
' i think they ( the penalty claims ) were both pretty clear to be honest with you , so , there 's not a lot i 'm going to comment on in that sense , but he ( @entity12 ) made both decisions and we have taken the brunt of them			1
it was unfortunate - both times			2
@entity15 goes down under a challenge by @entity13 but the home side did not get a penalty @entity22 was unhappy with the decision not to award a penalty and made his feelings known to @entity12 ' it 's disappointing when you do n't receive the decisions and particularly so early on , particularly when you 're on top			1
you 're not going to cry over that , but when they are that obvious it 's a little bit difficult			0
' the defeat saw @entity3 drop to 17th in the table , with only a better goal record keeping @entity22 's side outside of the relegation zone			1
the 65 - year - old revealed after the match that @entity0 had apologised for his sending off and labelled the two bookings as ' silly ' - with the @entity86 midfielder now ruled out of saturday 's trip to @entity88			1
' he ( @entity12 ) decided to give me a yellow on the first one which for whatever reason , the second one i got caught in him it looked like he was right behind me and he 's deemed it a yellow card , ' @entity0 added			1
' i 've got to accept that now , i 'm disappointed within myself to be missing the game and not being a part ( of it ) with the boys on saturday			2
@entity9 manager @entity103 ( left ) congratulates two - goal hero @entity35 after the @entity9 victory ' we 've got a game in five days ' time , everybody has got to be ready and prepared			1
it 's an opportunity for somebody else to step in and whoever is fit and available to be ready and i think the boys are going to give a good account of themselves			0
i have no doubt about that			0
' the win at @entity32 was @entity9 's second of the season and manager @entity103 will be hoping the result banishes the embarrassment of an 8 - 0 thrashing at @entity122 two weeks ago			1
@entity27 grabbed his first league goal for the @entity124 since his summer move from @entity126 and the @entity127 is hoping to build on the victory when they welcome @entity130 to the @entity131 on sunday			0
' it 's a very good result for us , ' he said			0
' it was much needed and it 's an important three points on the board			0
i 'm very happy to get my goal but more so with the team performance and final result			0
' we 're now looking forward to playing at home on sunday in front of the fans , turn in another performance and get another three points			0
' our fans were brilliant			0
it has been tough for them lately after the last two results but they backed us in their numbers and they deserve to enjoy this result , they are very important for us and did us proud here			0
' one downside on the evening for @entity9 was a shoulder injury suffered by @entity157 during his challenge with @entity159			2
the former @entity161 full - back was taken straight to hospital and @entity103 confirmed after the match that the @entity164 had suffered a dislocation .			2
