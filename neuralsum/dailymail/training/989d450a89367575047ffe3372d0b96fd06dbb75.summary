@entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 has some unexpected roots , it has been revealed - his ancestors were carpenters in @entity5 , @entity6			1
the family of the former @entity9 governor lived in @entity11 's industrial northwest for generations before converting to @entity13 and heading for the @entity14			1
@entity1 is one of the wealthiest @entity15 ever to run for the @entity16 and has estimated his fortune at between $ 190million and $ 250m			1
@entity34 , a 69 - year - old widow who lives in a modest home in @entity36 , the shipyard town once at the heart of @entity20 's industrial revolution , said : ' it 's all come out of the blue			1
' it 's a surprise really			0
' her link to @entity1 came to light when her grandson - in - law began tracing their family history by delving into archives in their home county of @entity52 two weeks ago			1
records show that mrs @entity34 is @entity1 's fourth cousin - they share a great - great - great grandfather , @entity54 , who died in 1859			1
now she ca n't help but notice that her distant @entity15 relative bears a striking family resemblance			1
' i saw him on the telly twice the other day , last week i think			0
he looks a bit like my brother , ' said mrs @entity34 , a retired factory worker , most of whose children have no jobs			0
' [ my brother ] looks quite like him			0
he had dark hair like him			0
it 's all grey now			0
he ( @entity1 ) looks like our @entity68			2
same sort of face and everything			0
' distant cousins : @entity34 , a former factory worker , said she believes the wealthy @entity15 looks like her brother cuppa and a catch - up , @entity77 ? @entity78 , his wife @entity79 and their 12 - year - old daughter @entity80 at their home in @entity84 , northern @entity11			1
mrs @entity85 is @entity1 's fourth cousin , twice removed she shrugs and smiles when asked about @entity1 's privileged status in the @entity15 , where he is sometimes accused by critics of being out of touch with poor people			1
' i wish him luck and everything else , ' she said			0
for @entity1 , his faith and @entity11 roots remain a sensitive issue , partly because his @entity29 religion is still regarded with suspicion by some @entity15 voters			1
when he came to @entity20 in july this year , @entity1 did not visit the area where his family have their roots - unusual since emphasising a @entity104 heritage is often seen as an electoral plus in @entity15 politics			1
@entity23 , who faces @entity1 in the november 6 presidential election , went down well last year when he toured an @entity25 village where one of his forebears once lived - despite being born in @entity111 himself			1
@entity1 's campaign spokeswoman made no comment when asked how the @entity2 challenger felt about his @entity11 origins			1
in @entity52 , the county the candidate 's ancestors left behind , @entity1 enthusiasts offered their own explanation			2
' he is @entity29 and this is mormon central , ' said @entity123 , a local vicar with an interest in @entity1 's heritage			2
' perhaps he would perceive ( coming here ) as highlighting his @entity13 more than highlighting his roots			2
' amateur genealogist @entity78 was astonished to discover while digging into regional records recently that his wife @entity131 's granddaughter - was @entity1 's fourth cousin twice removed			1
humble origins : a sign for @entity134 in @entity5 , where relatives of the @entity2 candidate were born and bred in the 18th and 19th century poring over archival material at his home in the industrial city of @entity84 , mr @entity78 , whose day job involves dressing in a duck outfit and posing as a mascot for a local football team , more interested in @entity15 politics			1
' if he got in , @entity15 would be a completely different place in three years time to what it is now , ' he said			2
' i do n't know if it will be for the better			0
' mrs @entity85 , 32 , was equally astounded by his research			0
' i was very much shocked ... it still feels like ... it 's not quite happening to ( me ) , ' she said			0
' it 's quite an unreal feeling			0
' she said meeting @entity1 in the @entity16 would be ' surreal ' , but she ' would like to go there for a brew if he ever got in there			2
' the village of @entity5 , a picturesque scattering of mediaeval cottages , is where the @entity1 clan began			2
hidden past : @entity1 did not visit the area his family are from when he came to @entity20 in july one of his ancestors was carpenter @entity168 , who gained notoriety for making his own coffin and putting it on display in his workshop before he died in 1915			1
' i get the impression that quite a few @entity175 were carpenters			0
it seems to be a family trait , ' said @entity179 , a @entity5 historian , outside a canary - yellow cottage where @entity168 used to live and work			1
' should @entity1 succeed and become the next president of the @entity15 , he would be able to look around in pride and say : " my great - great - granddad came from @entity5 "			1
well , i hope he can say that in pride			0
' another famous son in the family was @entity54 , who went to @entity188 and became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the 18th century			2
who do you think you are ? an original baptism record shows details of some of the presidential candidate 's relatives in what was then @entity52 two streets and a park are named after the artist , who is said to have had a secret affair with the mistress of @entity204 , the naval hero who defeated the @entity205 at @entity206			2
@entity54 was buried in the churchyard of @entity209 's parish church - where @entity1 's great - great grandparents , @entity211 and @entity212 , were baptised and married before converting to the @entity29 faith in 1837 and moving to the @entity15			1
their daughter @entity80 's baptism record from the year before is still in the archives in @entity84 , with her father 's vocation - joiner - scribbled in an old parish book			2
' it 's a fascinating story that @entity5 holds , ' said reverend @entity222 , gazing over the town 's skyline from the top of a church tower - a view that has changed little since @entity228 lived here			0
pointing at a couple of old communion cups , he added : ' the @entity175 could have touched these			0
' at the time , @entity52 was a tough , polluted and chaotic place to live , and disease and drunkenness were rife			0
mormon promises of a better and more orderly life fell on fertile ground			0
' it was a grimy , mucky hell on earth , ' said @entity123 , the vicar			0
' why on earth you would want to stay here , if somebody tells you there is milk and honey elsewhere ? it was a horrible place			0

@entity1 did not visit his family when he came to @entity20 in july
his distant cousins live in *terraced* houses and some are unemployed
@entity1 is one of the wealthiest @entity15 to enter the presidential race
his @entity11 relatives say they would love to meet for a cup of tea
his great - great grandparents converted to @entity13 and moved to the @entity15 in 1837
