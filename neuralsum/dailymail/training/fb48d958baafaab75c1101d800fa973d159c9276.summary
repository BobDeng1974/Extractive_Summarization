by @entity0 @entity1 has attributed @entity4 ’s dismal @entity3 defeat in @entity5 to a lack of investment in the first - team squad			1
speaking after a 4 - 1 first leg loss to @entity12 left @entity14 ’s champions with a mountain to climb to reach the play - off round , the former @entity10 boss claimed it was an accident waiting to happen			1
before leaving his post in may , the @entity18 spoke publicly on the dangers of failing to replace key players such as @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
called it ! former @entity4 manager @entity1 was not surprised by @entity4 's defeat in @entity3 qualifying crushing : @entity4 players leave the field after losing 4 - 1 to @entity12 in the first leg of third round qualifying as new manager @entity34 faced questions over his team selection in wednesday night ’s debacle , his predecessor claimed a heavy defeat in the tricky qualifiers would have happened sooner or later			1
‘ i would n’t say it was inevitable , but i think it might have been on the cards , ’ he said			0
‘ there has been no investment at the minute in the team and @entity34 really has n’t had much time to bed himself in with @entity48 and get to know the players			1
‘ those qualifiers are always really tricky and it took me a year or two			0
i remember @entity53 in his first game losing 5 - 0 to @entity55 in @entity56			2
he won the second leg 4 - 0 – but it was too big a gap to recover			1
‘ so it can happen			0
they are not out of the tie , but they are going to have to play supremely well to get through now			0
’ tall order : new @entity10 boss @entity34 has it all to do to take @entity4 into the @entity3 proper failure to overcome the deficit would see @entity4 drop into a @entity70 play - off clash and lose a potential £ 15million in @entity72 revenues			1
@entity1 believes the club have insulated themselves against that by storing away the cash from previous campaigns			1
but failure could increase the chances of @entity79 and @entity80 being sold to plug the gap and impact on the club ’s attendances in the coming season			0
admitting he left the @entity4 job because domestic football no longer stirred his competitive urges , @entity1 – who led the club to three successive titles - added : ‘ i think the @entity3 is always important			1
it gives the fans and players something to look forward to			0
‘ there is the money side as well , but the club is financially healthy			0
they can maybe take the hit on not making the @entity3 this year			1
i do n’t think it will be disastrous			0
fine start : @entity4 's @entity100 celebrates after putting his side 1 - 0 up in @entity5 ‘ but in terms of the football angle , it ’s imperative to stay in there and qualify if they can			1
i was player , coach , manager and it was a huge part of my life			2
but in the end we won the league by 30 points last season and i just thought it was maybe a good time to leave and look for a different challenge			0
‘ we felt , myself and the backroom team , that the challenge was n’t really there			0
we had a great time in the @entity3 , but we struggled a little bit for competition			1
’ @entity12 ’s @entity123 missed two penalties – with @entity79 saving the second to keep @entity4 ’s slender hopes alive			1
but the @entity5 club ’s captain says @entity130 ’s side will finish the job professionally at @entity132 next wednesday			0
‘ i ’m positive we can now finish the job in @entity14 , ’ said @entity123			0
‘ we were comfortable at home and played very well with the goals from @entity135 helping us to settle down			0
off the hook ? @entity4 were lucky not to lose by more after @entity123 missed two penalties ‘ but we are aware it is half - time and that @entity4 came back against @entity139 last season			1
that means we must concentrate for the 90 minutes			0
we believed in ourselves and i do n’t know what was wrong with @entity4			2
’ @entity123 apologised to his team - mates for wasting the penalties , but vowed to take another in @entity146 if it comes			2
‘ i think in the future i will score – in fact if we get one in @entity146 t i will take it and this time i will score no problem			0
‘ this was just one of those nights , but like the team i have faith in my ability			0
worse things happen in life than missing a penalty and i thank my team - mates for saving me			2
‘ i apologised to them afterwards but we were together as a team and were all able to laugh because of the final result			2
’ meanwhile , sources close to @entity4 striker @entity168 have played down claims of a bust - up between the player and manager @entity34 after he was left on the bench against @entity174			1
@entity175 and new loan signing @entity176 were given the nod to start in the 4 - 1 defeat and both were replaced during the game - although @entity168 did not see any action .			1

@entity4 were defeated 4 - 1 by @entity12 in @entity3 qualifying
former manager @entity1 was not surprised by the result and admitted lack of investment could be a reason for the crushing blow
the @entity192 have only brought in @entity193 and @entity176
new manager @entity34 has his work cut out for him at @entity10
