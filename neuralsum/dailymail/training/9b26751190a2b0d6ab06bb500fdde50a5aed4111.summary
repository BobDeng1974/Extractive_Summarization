by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter you might be only a pretty face , but it seems that ’s all you need to get on in today ’s world of work			0
a study has found beautiful people do better in their careers – even after their youthful good looks have begun to fade			1
at each career stage studied , pretty people held more prestigious jobs than plain @entity15			1
destined for success ? sociologists found that beauty played a role in what job a person got and how successful they were , even when taking into account iq , level of education and parents ' education the researchers said attractive sorts may gravitate to good jobs because they are more confident			1
alternatively , the plain may be penalised by employers			0
the @entity33 and @entity34 team used decades of data on more than 8,000 men and women who left school in @entity39 in the @entity40 in 1957			1
this included information about employment at various points in life , school photos that were used to rate their looks and information about their education and their parents ’ social class			1
those rated the most attractive on leaving school tended to have better jobs and more prestigious careers , even when close to retirement			0
the finding held even when other factors , such as intelligence and education , were taken into account			1
researcher @entity62 , of @entity64 ’s @entity63 , said good looking people may benefit from a ‘ beauty premium ’			1
she added : ‘ we found facial attractiveness is important in determining people ’s occupational prestige at the beginning of the career as it is in the middle or at the end			2
’ the study tracked the career outcomes of more than 8,000 people and found the best looking were more successful throughout their whole lives ' or , in other words , the so called beauty premium is stable throughout people 's employment history and pretty people are doing better even as they age			1
' writing in @entity85 in @entity86 , dr @entity62 said employers may be drawn towards attractive staff			0
it is also possible the good looking have the confidence to aim higher			0

' our facial features are largely genetically determined and the research raises a number of questions regarding the processes that underlie the reproduction of social inequalities , said dr @entity132			0
' for example , do beautiful men and women have higher occupational prestige because employers discriminate against plain people ? ' @entity139 is it that beautiful men and women choose more prestigious occupations , for example , because they enjoy a higher self esteem and are more self confident			0
