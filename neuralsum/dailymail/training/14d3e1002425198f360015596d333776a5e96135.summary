@entity0 is renowned for its delicious curries and mouthwatering noodle dishes - so much so , many restaurants attempt to replicate these national cuisines , but with limited success			2
in a bid to clamp down on poorly made , bland meals , the @entity7 government has stepped in and created its @entity11 program			1
the initiative will use an app to find authentic recipes , alongside a so - called ‘ e-delicious ’ machine to test dishes across the country			1
the @entity11 program was setup to improve meals across @entity0			1
its ‘ e-delicious machine ’ ( illustrated ) features 10 sensors that identify taste signatures for dishes , by measuring the conductivity of the samples at different voltages			1
dishes are then given an authenticity score out of 100 the @entity11 program uses an app to store authentic recipes			1
its so - called ‘ e-delicious ’ machine is then taken to restaurants to test samples of dishes			1
the machine has a total of 10 taste sensors			2
each recipe has a unique signature , and , using these sensors , the machine can identify the signature of tested dishes			1
these signatures are created by measuring the conductivity of the food samples at different voltages			0
the two signatures , or electrical readings , are compared to one another , to achieve an authenticity score , out of 100			1
a score lower than 80 is a poor replica			2
the machine has a total of 10 taste sensors			2
each authentic recipe has a unique signature , and , using these sensors , the machine can also identify the signature of tested dishes			1
these signatures are created by measuring the conductivity of the food samples at different voltages			0
these two signatures , or electrical readings , are compared to one another , to achieve an authenticity score , out of 100			1
any dish that scores lower than 80 is deemed a poor replica			2
but those that score highly are given an award of authenticity			0
this includes a sticker that can be placed in the windows of restaurants			0
the technical specifications have not been revealed , but @entity78 , a @entity7 businessman involved in the project , told the @entity80 the machines cost around £ 11,000 ( $ 18,000 ) each			0
during tests , the @entity80 used the machine to discover the authenticity of a green curry from the @entity86 of @entity0			0

it scored a below - par 78 out of 100 last week , phd student @entity91 from @entity92 in @entity93 released details of a nanosensor ( pictured ) that performs a similar ‘ taste ’ test for wine			1
dubbed ' mini-mouth ' , the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person 's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and how astringent it is it scored a below - par 78 out of 100			0

dubbed ' mini-mouth ' , the sensor mimics the reaction that wine creates on a person 's tongue to determine how the alcohol tastes and , in particular , how astringent it is			0
the sensor uses salivary proteins to measure the sensation that would be felt on a human mouth			0
the researchers study how the proteins change in the interaction with the wine , and they can use this to describe the effect of the wine .			0

the @entity11 program was setup to improve meals across the country
it involves an app for storing authentic recipes and an ‘ e-delicious machine ’
@entity137 has 10 sensors that create taste readings on an electrical scale
this creates a dish ‘ signature ’ that can be compared to an *original* recipe
the machine then gives the dish a score out of 100 - and anything lower than 80 is considered poor *quality*
restaurants that serve authentic @entity7 dishes receive an authenticity award
