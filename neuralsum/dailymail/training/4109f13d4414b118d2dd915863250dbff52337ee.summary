the former @entity7 candidate , 65 , said today in his first interview since losing the election that while he believed he was going to become commander - in - chief , early polling numbers spelled out trouble , and he began to have a ‘ slow recognition ’ that @entity14 would win once seeing that @entity15 was a close race			1

‘ in our church , we ’re used to serving and you know , you can be in a very high position , but you recognize you ’re serving			2
and now all of a sudden , you ’re released and you ’re nobody			2
and we ’re used to that			2
it ’s like we came and stepped forward to serve			2
' and you know , the other part of it was an amazing thing , and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of - a lot of people around us and all of a sudden , it was nothing , ’ she said			2
‘ but the good news is we like each other , ’ she joked			2

' - @entity0 on infamous ' 47 percent ' video ‘ it was a very unfortunate statement , ' @entity0 told @entity29			1

there ’s no question that hurt , and did real damage to my campaign			0
' but @entity0 was defiant in saying that his career in politics is not over			0
