if he had apologised , he would have been			0

’ @entity63 left @entity86 soon after			0
do n’t mess with @entity64			0
@entity4 vs @entity88 – january 2009 @entity89 ’s @entity88 glaringly headed wide when presented with an open goal during a disappointing draw against @entity92			1
@entity4 ’s synopsis was that ‘ you will never get a better chance to win a match than that			1
my missus could have scored that one ’			0
a fair enough assessment given the gravity of the miss , but it did n’t stop a disgruntled @entity88 forcing a move away from @entity103			0
@entity104 vs @entity105 – january 2013 this was an on - going soap opera worthy of primetime on terrestrial television - neither of these egos refused to budge an inch			1
the frosty relationship appeared reached its height in january 2013 , the season in which @entity113 relinquished their @entity119 crown			1
@entity104 reacted angrily to something @entity105 had done in training at @entity122 , yanking on his striker ’s bib as the pair became embroiled in a bust - up			1
the manager lost his job at the end of the campaign and @entity105 was sold to @entity131 the same year			1
@entity113 were n’t about to see their reputation tarnished and washed their hands of both , who had distracted from retaining the title			1
@entity88 missed a glaring sitter , heading wide against @entity92 as @entity89 could only draw at home manager @entity4 was n't impressed , saying his ' missus ' could have scored from six yards out @entity104 was photographed grabbing @entity105 's bib during @entity113 training the two @entity142 became divisive characters at the @entity144 and were let go by @entity113 @entity145 vs @entity146 – november 1993 this feud lasted a good 19 years			1
@entity148 winger @entity146 had over-hit a last - minute cross in a 1994 @entity151 qualifier against @entity152			0
fairly nondescript stuff , until you fast - forward 15 seconds and see the ball nestled in the @entity156 net from the resulting counter attack – a goal that in fact ended their hopes of reaching the @entity162			0
@entity145 , then the manager , was clearly still disgruntled by @entity146 giving the ball away and wrote so in a book			0
@entity146 took his former boss to court – citing defamation – only for it to be thrown out			0
‘ the court wanted to end this story by dismissing @entity146 's case , ’ @entity145 ’s lawyer said			0
see the video below for @entity146 's cross against @entity152 @entity146 ( pictured playing for @entity89 in 1998 ) was criticised by @entity145 ( right ) in a book @entity176 vs @entity177 – september 2012 @entity178 goalkeeper @entity177 was n’t having the best of days away at @entity180 two years ago			1
he was at fault for two goals in the opening 20 minutes at @entity184 and hauled off by manager @entity176			1
but it got markedly worse , quickly			0
the 21 - year - old was so incensed by this decision that he had sulked off straight down the tunnel			0
@entity176 ’s response ? ‘ he was one of the worst players i have ever seen in a football match			2
’ @entity177 – characterised as ‘ arrogant ’ and ‘ ignorant ’ - was forced to apologise			2
watch @entity176 's incredible interview after the game below @entity177 was dragged off after just 20 minutes as @entity178 went 2 - 0 down away at @entity180 @entity195 was n't able to exert himself on the @entity70 first team during his spell at @entity86 @entity64 vs @entity195 - july / august 2014 @entity70 may have managed to scoop £ 28million from @entity195 this summer , but it appeared @entity64 never had any intention of blooding the striker into his first team			1
‘ @entity195 was always clear that in his mentality and his approach he was not highly motivated to come to a competitive situation at @entity70 , ’ argued @entity64			0
@entity195 and blunt in his response : ‘ i need to play at a high level and play in a good team			0
