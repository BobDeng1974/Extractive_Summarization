the wait for @entity2 ’s @entity1 is nearly over , according to the latest leak			1
promotional box art seems to confirm the announcement for @entity2 's next smartphone as being tuesday 9 september			1
and several other details - including the position of the volume buttons and the new location of the power button - have also been revealed			1
on the right is the box art previously leaked by @entity21 of @entity22 , which confirmed details on the @entity25 hours before it was announced the leak reported by @entity27 came from @entity21 , editor of the leading @entity14 @entity2 blog nowhereelse.fr			1
the handset is expected to be unveiled on tuesday 9 september and will come in 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch sizes			2
it is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch - proof sapphire screen , which is about to go into large - scale production in the @entity35			2
the screen is tipped to be ‘ @entity37 + ’ with a 1,704x904 resolution			0
experts also predict a faster @entity41 processor , better rear - facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses - and wireless charging support			0
it may also include a heart rate sensor like the @entity48			0
last year @entity21 unveiled details on the @entity25 hours before launch , lending some credibility to the leak			2
he claims that the image of the box art was passed to him by a reliable @entity56 source			1
on the box a date showing the expected announcement date can be seen - tuesday 9 september			1
for the release of the @entity61 had a similar design , displaying the date of the announcement on the box			1
the artwork also shows the new shape of the volume buttons , eschewing the circular design on the @entity25 for a more rectangular look			1
and the sleep and wake button has also been moved from the top of the phone to the right hand side			1
as expected , the fingerprint sensor used to lock and unlock the phone returns , while the charging port of the @entity15 6 now comes in the form of a @entity81 connector			1
the source also apparently claimed that a @entity84 version of the phone will be available			1
this close - up of the box shows the rumoured features and release date of the @entity15 6			1
the ' @entity90 switch ' remains in the same place from the @entity92 , but the volume buttons seem to have changed to a rectangular shape , while the power button has been moved			1
the date of the release is also supposedly shown with the @entity15 launch two weeks away , new images of leaked parts have been revealed on a near daily basis			1
multiple images of both the front panel and the rear shell of the 4.7 - inch device have surfaced , while this image seemingly shows the design of the entire device this photo suggests that @entity2 ’s @entity81 cable is set to become even easier to use because it will be reversible at both ends			2
@entity113 's image hints that @entity2 's next cable will have a reversible usb port ( pictured right ) , with a floating centre instead of fixed pins ( plug pictured left ) last week it was reported that a last minute redesign of a key component had left @entity2 's suppliers scrambling to get enough screens ready for the @entity15			1
@entity124 claimed supply chain sources said the need to redesign a key component disrupted panel production ahead of next month 's expected launch			0
earlier this month , leaked images were posted by @entity132 designers @entity133 and @entity134 and claimed to show the rear shell ( pictured ) and an embedded logo , alongside a cable that is said to be used for the home button			1
the images are purported to be of the 4.7 - inch @entity15 6 model the issue highlights the risks and challenges that suppliers face to meet @entity2 's tough specifications , and comes on the heels of a separate screen technology problem , since resolved , in making thinner screens for the larger @entity15 model			1
two supply chain sources said display panel production suffered a setback after the backlight that helps illuminate the screen had to be revised , putting screen assembly on hold for part of june and july			0
another image showed an embedded @entity2 logo ( pictured ) that the designers claim is scratchproof , and made of @entity162 alloy			0
@entity162 is a super-strong material that can be moulded into shape one said @entity2 , aiming for the thinnest phone possible , initially wanted to cut back to a single layer of backlight film , instead of the standard two layers , for the 4.7 - inch screen , which went into mass production ahead of the 5.5 - inch version			2
but the new configuration was not bright enough and the backlight was sent back to the drawing board to fit in the extra layer , costing precious time and temporarily idling some screen assembly operations , the source said			2
a patent , initially filed in 2012 , describes a bayonet mount system for an @entity15 camera ( pictured )			2
the protruding camera system is similar to that currently used on slr cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion earlier this month another leak revealed a protruding camera - a feature that was first reported on in april - recessed volume controls , which were hinted at during the start of the month , and an embedded logo			2
the images were purported to be of the 4.7 - inch @entity15 model and were leaked by @entity198 designers @entity133 and @entity134			1
synthetic sapphire is a hard , transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide , produced at high temperatures			0
as the material is heated , it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond - coated saws			0
these round disks are ground into shape , and polished , to become glass			0
the technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin , super-strong and scratch resistant			0
@entity2 already uses sapphire crystal in the @entity215 fingerprint scanner on its latest @entity25 and to protects the phone 's camera			0
as a result , sapphire glass could potentially replace @entity220 currently used in most high - end smartphones			0
another image taken by the designers showed an embedded @entity2 logo that the designers claim is scratchproof , and made of @entity162 alloy			0
@entity162 is a super-strong material that can be moulded into shape			0
another feature rumoured to feature in @entity2 ’s @entity1 is a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire			2
to create enough of the man - made sapphire material , which make screens that are scratch - resistant and flexible , @entity2 struck a deal with @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity239			0
the sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable energy , which has been built as part of the $ 578million ( £ 350million ) arrangement , @entity240 is claimed to be composed of thin man - made layers of sapphire , which enables the material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass			0
a @entity253 videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage of abuse , from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it			0
in the video , @entity263 stands on the thin screen and bends it			0
when released , it goes back it its normal shape , raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen			0

a leading @entity14 blog says the @entity15 will be announced on tues 9 sept
the information comes from supposedly leaked box art of the device
on the box a date is shown , in *addition* to new details on the @entity1
includes the shape of the volume buttons and new power button position
and a source also said the phone will come in a @entity84 model
