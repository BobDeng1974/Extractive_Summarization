she suffered serious head injuries after he swung the hockey stick ' like an axe ' and hit her with ' severe force ' - she died two days later			2
@entity0 , 44 , of @entity20 , @entity21 , denies murder and told police he acted in self - defence			1
@entity21 @entity25 heard yesterday that the fatal incident took place after ms @entity3 turned up at mr @entity0 's home , where she was allegedly ' abusive and aggressive ' to another woman with whom he had three children			1
all five children were present when ' devoted mother ' ms @entity3 was knocked unconscious by @entity0			1
opening the case , prosecutor @entity33 described how in the moments before she was hit , a passing postman heard ms @entity3 say to @entity0 : ' these are your kids , go on , show them what you 're like			2
' the court heard @entity0 then turned around and walked back to his house before returning with the hockey stick			2
mr @entity33 said : ' the witness could hear the lady who must be @entity3 shouting , " go on , hit me , i want you to hit me			0
" ' that 's exactly what the defendant did , striking a single blow across the head , causing her to fall to the floor on the road			0
' following his arrest , @entity0 told police ' i did n't mean to hurt her '			0
he said that ms @entity3 attacked him with a knife and that he struck the fatal blow accidentally as he tried to disarm her with the hockey stick			1
but mr @entity33 said no knife was recovered from the scene and that none of the witnesses saw one			0
mr @entity33 told the jury : ' you will be sure that rather than jabbing or flicking at @entity68 to disarm her , @entity3 was n't in possession of a knife and there was n't a jab or flick - this was a hockey stick raised , brought down with severe force , knocking her unconscious			1
ms @entity3 was knocked unconscious by @entity0 in front of their daughter @entity79 and son @entity80 ( pictured ) ' the location , the nature of the laceration , swelling , bleeding , bruising and nerve damage to the brain is all consistent with a blow of severe force , as described by all the witnesses			1
' this was an unlawful assault striking a violent blow and at the time of striking this blow the defendant must have intended to cause at the very least really serious harm			0
' consequently , the @entity25 say having heard the evidence you will be sure the defendant is guilty of murder			0
' following her death last year daughter @entity79 and son @entity80 described ms @entity3 as a ' devoted mother '			0
