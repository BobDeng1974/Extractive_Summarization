white people will no longer make up a majority of @entity2 by 2043 , according to new census projections , part of a historic shift that is already reshaping the nation 's schools , workforce and electorate			1
the official projection , released today by the @entity11 , now places the tipping point for the white majority a year later than previous estimates , which were made before the impact of the recent economic downturn was fully known			0
@entity17 continues to grow and become more diverse due to higher birth rates among minorities , particularly for @entity20 who entered the @entity2 at the height of the immigration boom in the 1990s and early 2000s			2
since the mid- 2000 housing bust , however , the arrival of millions of new immigrants from @entity26 and other nations has slowed , pushing minority growth below its once - torrid pace			0
these numbers show a steep decline in the number of white americans while the @entity20 and black populations appear to rise the country 's changing demographic mosaic has stark political implications , shown clearly in last month 's election that gave president @entity47 a second term - in no small part due to his support from 78 per cent of non-white voters			1
the @entity53 white population , now at 197.8 million , is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024 , before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers as the massive baby boomer generation enters its golden years			0
' the fast - growing demographic today is now the children of immigrants , ' said @entity60 , a global expert on immigration and dean of @entity64 's @entity63 , describing the rate of minority growth in the @entity2 as dipping from ' overdrive ' to ' drive			1
' even with slowing immigration , @entity60 says , the ' die has been cast ' for strong minority growth from births			0
as recently as 1960 , whites made up 85 per cent of the @entity2 , but that share dropped after a 1965 overhaul to @entity2 immigration laws opened doors to waves of new immigrants from @entity26 , @entity17 and @entity80			2
by 2000 , the percentage of @entity2 whites had slid to 69 per cent ; it now stands at roughly 64 per cent			2
population surge : @entity17 continues to grow and become more diverse due to higher birth rates among minorities ' moving forward , the @entity2 will become the first major post-industrial society in the world where minorities will be the majority , ' @entity60 said			2
' with the white baby boomer population now leaving the work force , the most fundamental challenge will be connecting with this fast - growing @entity2 group in terms of their education			1
' the @entity2 has nearly 315 million people today			0
according to the projections released wednesday , the @entity2 population is projected to cross the 400 million mark in 2051 , reaching 420.3 million a half century from now in 2060			1
shift : hispanics , currently 17 per cent of the population , will more than double in absolute number , making up 31 per cent , or nearly 1 in 3 residents by 2060 , whites should drop to 43 per cent of the @entity2 at that time , blacks will make up 14.7 per cent , up slightly from today			1
hispanics , currently 17 per cent of the population , will more than double in absolute number , making up 31 per cent , or nearly 1 in 3 residents			0
@entity112 are expected to increase from 5 per cent of the population to 8 per cent			0
the point when minority children become the majority is expected to arrive much sooner - 2019			1
last year , racial and ethnic minorities became a majority among babies ages 1 and younger for the first time in @entity2 history			0
at the same time , the @entity2 population as a whole is aging , driven by white baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964			1
over the next half century , the ' oldest old ' - those ages 85 and older - is projected to more than triple to 18.2 million , reaching 4 per cent of the @entity2 population			1
the actual shift in demographics will be influenced by a host of factors that ca n't always be accurately pinpointed - the pace of the economic recovery , cultural changes , natural or manmade disasters , as well as an overhaul of immigration law , which is expected to be debated in @entity138 early next year			0
' the next half century marks key points in continuing trends - the @entity2 will become a plurality nation , where the @entity53 white population remains the largest single group , but no group is in the majority , ' said acting census director @entity146			1
changes : the @entity53 white population , now at 197.8 million , is projected to peak at 200 million in 2024 , before entering a steady decline in absolute numbers as the massive baby boomer generation enters its golden years @entity153 have been seeking to broaden their appeal to minorities , who made up 28 per cent of the electorate this year , after faring poorly among non-whites on @entity158 , when @entity153 presidential candidate @entity159 carried only about 20 per cent of non-white voters			0
the race and ethnic changes are already seen in pockets of the @entity2 and in the younger age groups , where roughly 45 per cent of all students in k - 12 are @entity20 , blacks , asian - americans and others			1
already , the @entity170 and four states - @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity26 and @entity174 - have minority populations greater than 50 per cent ; across the @entity2 , more than 11 per cent of counties have tipped to ' majority - minority ' status			1
last month , nearly all voters over age 65 were white ( 87 per cent ) , but among voters under age 30 , just 58 per cent were white			0
' irrespective of future immigration and minority fertility patterns , the @entity2 is facing a stagnating white population , ' said @entity187 , a demographer at the @entity188			2
stalled : since the mid- 2000 housing bust , the arrival of millions of new immigrants from @entity26 and other nations has slowed , pushing minority growth below its once - torrid pace ' the biggest shift will occur over the next 20 years as the mostly white baby boom generation moves into traditional retirement years			0
it is in the child and early labor force ages where we must be ready for the greatest changes as new @entity2 minorities take over for aging whites			0
' the rapidly growing non-white population gives the @entity2 a bit of an economic advantage over other developed nations , including @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , which are seeing reduced growth or population losses due to declining birth rates and limited immigration			2
the combined population of more - developed countries other than the @entity2 has been projected to decline beginning in 2016 , raising the prospect of prolonged budget crises as the number of working - age citizens diminish , pension costs rise and tax revenues fall			2
depending on future rates of immigration , the @entity2 population is estimated to continue growing through at least 2060			1
in a hypothetical situation in which all immigration - both legal and illegal - immediately stopped , previous government estimates have suggested the @entity2 could lose population beginning in 2048 .			0

number of white @entity2 now at 64 per cent , but *scales* will tip in the favor of @entity20 by 2043
minority children expected to become the majority by 2019
@entity2 population expected to keep growing until 2060
