@entity1 women 's captain @entity0 says there will be nothing especially friendly about the national team 's technically non-competitive clash with @entity6 at @entity7 next month			1
with both sides going through their qualifiers for the @entity10 in @entity11 undefeated , @entity1 and two - time @entity13 winners @entity6 are eager to get one over on their @entity15 rival on november 23			1
' we have a @entity13 to prepare for next year , against world - class opposition in @entity6 , ' says @entity0			2
' we are taking it very seriously			0
@entity1 women and @entity0 play @entity6 at @entity7 on november 23 the match against @entity6 will be @entity1 women 's first at national stadium @entity7 @entity25 of @entity6 celebrates her goal during the @entity27 2015 qualifier against @entity29 ' even though we are trying to attract as many people as we can , it is all about how we perform on the day and how we test ourselves against one of the best			1
' @entity6 went through their 10 group games with an astronomical goal difference of plus - 58 to @entity1 's plus - 51			1
but while not as prolific in front of goal , @entity37 's @entity36 women conceded just once and were never in danger of defeat before finishing off their campaign with a 10 - 0 thrashing of @entity44			2
@entity6 leaked four in total and needed an injury time winner to claim a 3 - 2 victory over @entity49 , a major scare for the team who have won the last six @entity53			2
' we want to be part of big games , and it does n't get much bigger than @entity1 v @entity6 at @entity7 , ' says @entity0			1
@entity0 met fellow @entity1 captain @entity58 at @entity59 on october 7 ' we want to take our confidence that we have from the last 10 qualifying games , our perfect record , our great win against @entity64 ( who also went through their qualifying group with 10 wins ) in a friendly , into this game with @entity6			1
' ' it is important that we play against the best teams in the world			0
we want to create a buzz before the @entity13			0
we want to play at @entity7 , play the best we can , try and get people on our side , so that when do go to @entity11 for the @entity13 we have the full support of the country back home			1
' while the @entity6 clash will be a first for an @entity1 women 's side at @entity7 , @entity0 has fond memories of her appearance there at the @entity84 for @entity85 against @entity86 where the second - minute goal from the defender turned out to be the winner in front of 70,584 fans			1
@entity0 skips over @entity86 keeper @entity92 to score the winner for @entity85 at @entity7 at @entity94 @entity0 thanks the crowd of 70,584 at @entity7 in the group match at @entity7 , where she 'll return to captain @entity1 against @entity6 in november the @entity98 were a turning point for women 's football , says @entity0 , and with a nail - biting end to the @entity103 season this weekend just gone - with @entity0 's @entity104 beating @entity105 to deny the @entity106 the title and @entity108 winning their game to retain the trophy - the time is ripe to impress again			1
' the @entity86 game atmosphere was something that has never been heard of in women ’s football - that was a massive time when we were able to change people ’s perception , ' says @entity0			2
' it was the @entity84 as a whole			0
everybody wanted to see any event that was connected with the @entity84 , any @entity85 team			0
we were lucky that we managed to get 70,000			0
it was an opportunity to go and see @entity7 , like our game against @entity6 in november , and an opportunity to watch an @entity127 team			2
' the last time @entity1 and @entity6 women 's side met was in the 2009 euros final , with the @entity131 winning 6 - 2			1
the heavy grass of @entity7 will be about as far removed from the controversial artificial surfaces that await @entity0 's side in @entity11 from june 6 , 2015			1
an outcry against the planned use of non-turf pitches in @entity11 is at such a level more than 50 leading players have joined to file a law suit against the @entity141 and @entity142 at the @entity143 on the basis of gender discrimination			0
but while players from the @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity86 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 have backed the protest , no @entity1 players have joined			0
' as a footballer i grew up playing on grass , so of course i want to be playing on what the men play on , ' says @entity0			2
' but we ca n't do anything about it now			0
we are just fully focused on preparing whatever pitch it is , and go and do our country proud			0
' before the last game against @entity44 , we trained every session on the @entity173 indoors			0
a lot of players at clubs play on that surface anyway so it is not if it is anything new to anyone			0
