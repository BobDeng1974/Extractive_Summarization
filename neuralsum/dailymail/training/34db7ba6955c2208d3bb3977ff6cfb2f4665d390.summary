by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 10:58 est , 17 march 2012 millions of passengers face air chaos during this @entity7 's @entity6 unless the government acts now to prevent a disaster , @entity1 and the @entity3 's leading airlines have warned transport secretary @entity10			1
in a leaked letter obtained by the @entity16 , the bosses of @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 warn @entity17 and her aviation team that they will be acting in a ' foolhardy and reckless ' manner if they ignore the warnings contained in their two - page missive			1
the near apocalyptic letter spells out how the airlines , air traffic controllers and the aviation industry believe ministers have not been listening to their repeated warnings of the impending chaos at airports and in the airspace above @entity3 and have rejected up to five solutions			1
@entity1 is among the airlines that have warned the government there could be chaos at @entity37 ( pictured ) this summer now ' time is running out			1
' it states bluntly that there is now a ' significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of @entity44 's major airports unless urgent action is taken ' causing misery to the millions of passengers who will fly into the @entity6 this summer			1
the airlines also warn of their ' significant concerns that insufficient progress has been made regarding the resilience of the airspace ' through which thousands of planes will take off and land during the sporting extravaganza			1
the letter says : ' all of the major @entity3 airlines , major airport operators and @entity60 believe that further action can and must be taken to ensure the impact on both " business as usual " travellers and visitors to @entity65 is reduced and that appropriate mitigation is available in advance of and during the period of the @entity70			1
' as the situation currently stands , the industry believes that there is a significant risk of severe delay and disruption at all of @entity44 's airports unless urgent action is taken			1
' the words ' urgent action ' are printed in bold to ram home the point			1
the letter gives a stark ultimatum to the government about the scale of the impending crisis , concern about ministerial inaction , and an action plan of what needs to happen before a crunch meeting set for march 22			1
the letter says bluntly : ' @entity92 is running out to ensure that any changes to proceedings and the appropriate training is in place prior to the games			2
' we urge both the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) and the @entity100 to support and agree to the proposals that the industry , including @entity60 , have put forward			2
' the letter stresses that an agreed solution is ' vital before the march 22 meeting if we are to succeed in our joint objective of ensuring that we as an industry play our part in ensuring commercial air travel to and from @entity44 for the @entity70 is a complete success '			2
but in a stunning ultimatum to ministers by the airlines the letter says : ' failure to respond leaves the @entity3 vulnerable to the type of major disruption that will cause significant reputational damage and would be foolhardy and reckless			1
' warned : transport secretary @entity10 was told @entity37 will struggle to cope the amount of flights laid on for the @entity6 the letter was sent by the operations chiefs of the four major airlines whose emblems fly at the top of the first page – @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity14 , and @entity13			1
it was sent to @entity128 , the director of airport strategy at the @entity130 and to @entity131 , chief executive officer of the @entity132 ( @entity100 )			0
the letter was copied in to transport secretary @entity10 , aviation minister @entity134 and a host of leading industry figures including @entity1 chief executive @entity137 , @entity1 's @entity138 who is chief executive parent company @entity139 ; @entity12 boss @entity140 , @entity14 boss @entity141 , the head of airport operator @entity143 , @entity144 and the head of @entity3 's air traffic controllers at @entity60 @entity147			1
it is signed by @entity1 ' director of operations @entity149 , @entity13 's head of operations and crewing @entity151 , @entity12 's director of operations , safety and security @entity154 , and @entity14 's chief operations officer @entity156			1
the @entity70 , most of which will take place at the @entity159 ( pictured ) in @entity160 , east @entity44 , is expected to put extra stress on @entity44 's transport network one insider close to the row said that the major airlines and air traffic controller bosses had together come up with a list of potential solutions to the expected air chaos caused by the extra traffic during the @entity6 period – particularly the three days before the @entity70 , the period of the men 's 100 metres final , and the period immediately after the closing ceremony			1
the senior source said frustrated airline chiefs believe ministers are ' burying their heads in the sand ' by suggesting that the industry had raised no concerns			0
their letter , dated thursday march 15 and copied in to @entity17 and her team , is their riposte to that			0
the insider said : ' we ca n't just wait until july and then say ' @entity189 – or rather @entity37 – we have a problem			0
ministers must deal with it now			0
' ' it 's like cars on the @entity195			2
on a quiet sunday morning , it 's fine and everyone can cope			2
but on a friday evening or a busy @entity199 , it does n't take much for the whole system to end in gridlock			0
and that 's the message we 're trying to get across to ministers			2
' another aviation insider said : ' this will affect millions of passengers at the busiestt time of the year and cause mayhem			2
the skies above @entity3 and its airports will be gridlocked			1
' in simple terms , the airlines and air traffic controllers have been calling for more flexibility to prioritise the bigger airports such as @entity37 and @entity217 over smaller airports such as @entity219 in @entity220 during times of highest demand			2
the airlines believes ' insufficient progress ' has been made with the @entity100 and the government when planning to cope with the expected extra flights , the impact that sudden and adverse weather could have if flights are cancelled , the impact of a ' security event ' or the response of the security services to it , the effect of non-scheduled additional general aviation and business traffic , and even the impact of aeroplanes and helicopters used by television companies to get aerial shots			0
the airlines say they sought additional ' resilience measures ' from the @entity99 last december			0
measured sought additional ' temporary permissions ' to allow airports , airlines and air traffic controllers to operate more flexibly and ' differently ' during the @entity70			2
the letter sets out how air traffic controllers recently presented ' five different options for prioritising air traffic ' in the southeast of @entity253			0
but it was rebuffed because the @entity100 claimed that under the current terms of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) licence , the @entity100 ' could not consent ' to any revisions of the traffic management criteria during the @entity6 period			0
damningly , the letter adds : ' further , we understand that the @entity99 are under the impression that industry is satisfied with the steps taken so far – this is far from the truth			0
' it warns ministers and aviation chiefs bluntly : ' @entity92 is running out			0
' the airlines conclude to ministers : ' as a group , we encourage you both to ensure that the appropriate action is taken to enable the industry to deliver the service that is so critical to the success of @entity65 , and we and our teams are available to provide whatever support and clarity is needed to enable the right outcome			1
' earlier this year , airport officials admitted that passengers arriving at @entity37 during the @entity6 face the threat of baggage chaos as thousands of athletes and officials bring in up to three times as much luggage as normal			2
@entity37 said there will be a 45 per cent increase in the number of passengers arriving on july 26 alone , the day before the @entity6 ' opening			0
@entity60 which is responsible for controlling aircraft flying in @entity3 airspace and the eastern part of the @entity297 said despite measures already in place there is ' still a risk of delay and disruption during the @entity70 ' in a statement it said : ' @entity60 is committed to a successful olympics for our customers and for the @entity3			1
for us , this means ensuring flights pass through the @entity3 air traffic system safely and as efficiently as possible			1
' with this goal in mind , we will have implemented new airspace , procedures , operational radar positions , facilitated @entity317 security airspace measures and communicated to the aviation community the changes they can expect during the @entity70			2
' but significantly it added : ' there is , however , still a risk of delay and disruption during the @entity70			0
this may be from security incidents , runway over capacity or bad weather ( e.g. thunder storms )			0
' we continue to work closely with the wider industry and with the @entity132 and @entity333 to find the right mechanisms and responses to these issues			0
' a @entity100 spokesman said : ' managing air traffic during the @entity6 period will require careful co-ordination between @entity60 , the aviation industry , the @entity100 and @entity333			0
' a range of proactive measures have already been put in place to help manage airspace as a whole network during the @entity6 , and we will continue to work very closely with @entity60 , the @entity333 and the aviation industry to prepare for the @entity70 and ensure that everything possible has been done to effectively manage @entity3 airspace			1
' a @entity99 spokeswoman said : ' the government is committed to delivering safe and efficient transport services for the @entity65 , and aviation is clearly a major part of this			0
' that is why we have already announced a range of special measures designed to protect scheduled air services from disruption during the @entity6 period			0
' we are confident that the majority of these additional issues have now been addressed and we look forward to discussing them with the airlines concerned at a meeting next week			0
' we continue to work closely with the @entity100 , @entity60 and the industry to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum			0

bosses of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 join forces with @entity1
they warn of impending chaos at airports and in @entity3 's airspace
