they are the misfits and understudies who have emerged as @entity4 ’s leading men			1
for no matter the obstacles which are presented – injury , suspension or failure of form – the @entity5 manage to put on a show			0
on saturday , during their 2 - 1 victory over @entity15 , the team included ; a 21 - year - old goalkeeper making his professional debut , a local lad previously deemed a back - up option , another native of @entity21 seemingly headed for the exit door , a rookie spaniard plucked from their second tier and a striker the manager suspects is n’t fit			1
before them , unlikely heroes such as @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 had all starred in a remarkable run which now reads seven wins from nine			0
but perhaps @entity29 best demonstrates the newfound resolve and depth of a squad which failed to win any of their first seven in the @entity49 , leaving @entity28 on the brink of unemployment			1
it was just a few weeks ago that @entity29 banged on the boss ’s door and told him he had been let down by the club after just one loan spell – at non-league @entity57 – in four years			1
but if the young custodian felt aggrieved with his hometown club and his manager , he certainly did not show it after being thrust into the action as a half - time replacement for the injured @entity64 , himself deputy to the sidelined @entity66			2
@entity36 ( left ) looked certain to be heading for the exit door , but now finds himself in the starting xi @entity28 bemoaned the amount of injury time at the end of the match against @entity15 within 60 seconds he flattened @entity73 and then pulled off a string of saves as the league leaders poured forward in search of parity late on			1
@entity29 , though , resisted			2
‘ coming on was amazing , but this is what i ’ve been working towards and i was ready for it , ’ he said			0
‘ i was a bit nervous at half time , but that ( clattering @entity73 ) was a massive moment			0
that first touch , if you can make a good punch or anything really , will always give you confidence for the rest of the half			0
’ by chance , @entity29 ’s mum was in the crowd at @entity33 for the first time in four years			2
@entity29 's mum was in the crowd for the first time in four years to see her son 's professional debut @entity37 has also been impressive in his first few months at @entity33 ‘ most of my family were there , my mum and dad and my girlfriend			1
it was amazing because obviously they ’ve supported me the whole way , ’ he said			0
‘ they are all lifelong @entity4 supporters			2
i grew up supporting @entity4 and to play for them in front of 52,000 and beating @entity15 at home , that ’s what dreams are made of			1
i ’m looking forward to maybe having a run in the team now			0
’ @entity29 ’s dream debut was made possible thanks to the match - winning double of substitute @entity38			1
@entity38 has struggled with injury , but came off the bench to score twice for @entity4 @entity38 's goals condemned leaders @entity15 to their first @entity49 loss of the season @entity28 still does n’t have the confidence to start with the @entity126 frontman – who returned from knee surgery in september – but three goals in two cameos from the bench in the past week could change that ahead of saturday ’s trip to @entity133			1
and @entity38 said : ‘ i feel fit			2
the gaffer just made the decision to put me on the bench			0
i do n’t know why but i ’m okay			0
i ’m not angry , i just wait for my time and even if it ’s just five minutes i will try to do well for those five minutes			0
’ @entity38 and @entity29 may have the odd gripe with @entity28 right now , but they , like the rest of their team - mates , have n’t let him down on the pitch			1
rather , the @entity5 misfits are coming together just nicely .			0

@entity4 's ' misfits ' came together to beat @entity15 2 - 1 on saturday
@entity29 , a 21 - year - old goalkeeper , made his professional debut
@entity35 and @entity36 were previously deemed *surplus*
@entity37 and @entity38 helped to beat leaders @entity15
