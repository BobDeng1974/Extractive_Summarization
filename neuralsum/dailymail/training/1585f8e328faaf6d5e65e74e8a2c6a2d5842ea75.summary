@entity0 hath no fury like a woman scorned , as @entity3 and former @entity4 contestant @entity4 recently proved			1
over the past few days @entity3 and @entity4 have unleashed a torrent of anger on social media towards the other women involved in their relationship woes			1
@entity3 's husband @entity10 cheated on the mother - of - five with two friends last year and @entity4 's romance with @entity14 ended in tears when he reconciled with his ex @entity16			1
meanwhile , @entity4 posted a picture on her @entity38 account captioned , ' i do n't take back , unlike " some " women ' , which is thought to be a thinly - veiled dig at model @entity16			1
but it seems @entity3 and @entity4 are not alone in turning their anger on the other women , rather than directing their anger at the men who caused them so much pain			1
when @entity14 's ex-girlfriend @entity51 gave an interview in which she said she and @entity14 had ' hooked up ' while he was engaged to @entity16 , @entity50 alleged that @entity16 sent her a series of unpleasant texts			1
similarly when former @entity57 hunk @entity56 cheated on @entity58 with @entity59 during the first season of the @entity62 - based reality show in 2010 , both women flung abuse at each other on camera			1
meanwhile in the @entity70 , @entity66 of @entity69 star @entity68 ’s former husband @entity67 left her for @entity71			1
@entity68 could not contain her vitriol for the country singer even admitting that at one point she thought she was going to ‘ kill ’ @entity71 for stealing the father of her two children			2
@entity4 posted this image to her @entity22 account with the caption : ' like @entity80 ? ? ? do n't waste ur time darling ... i do n't take back , unlike " some " women ' thought to be aimed at @entity16 @entity4 has been showing off her figure in a series of pictures on @entity22 since her split from @entity14 so why is it that when a partner cheats or ditches us for someone else so many females blame the ‘ other woman ' ? relationship expert @entity97 says that it is a relatively common way of coping with a partner 's betrayal			1
she said : ‘ sometimes , when women desperately want to make things work with their partner and take them back after an episode of cheating , the way of coping and dealing with it can be to blame the other woman or women involved			2
' my baaaay baaaay ! ' @entity71 recently posted this happy snap alongside her husband @entity67 , left ‘ in their minds it helps them to try and justify the cheating when in reality , both people involved in the cheating are equally at fault - and particularly the one already in a committed relationship			2
‘ you ca n't forgive and take someone back yet still blame the other women			2
this is n't congruent with moving forwards			0
‘ i think when it comes to moving on from cheating , if you do take the person back , you have to fully commit to moving forwards and that means not bringing up the cheating every time an argument arises			0
‘ that can be tough and so you really need to take a period of time to consider whether you can take them back and genuinely learn to forget the cheating and trust them or if it 's more out of desperation not to lose them			0
‘ the latter means you will likely live the relationship in constant anxiety , which is n't healthy			2
’ @entity146 has expressed her anger at @entity71 for ending her marriage to @entity67 psychologist dr @entity149 explained that often women feel , or want to feel , that their man has been manipulated by another other woman			1
‘ when the man cheats it is interpreted as being inspired , encouraged and manipulated by the other woman			0
' he said the wronged partner can see the ' the other woman ' as a ' threat to their self - worth , self - esteem and to their personal identity			0
‘ but they still want to blame them as it becomes part of a coping strategy			0
they can attribute their pain and low self - esteem to something that is outside of the relationship they 're trying to fix			2
' @entity97 said ending a relationship can sometimes be the only way to recover from a partner 's betrayal			1
‘ the anger and bitterness you experience when you have being wronged by someone you love is natural and feeling that is all part of the healing process			0
‘ but use that anger to fuel you in a positive way as opposed to dwelling on it and allowing it to completely consume you			0
‘ you will soon realise that your life is far better without someone who cheats on you and that you are worth more			0
‘ the anger will start to fade			0
be kind and good to yourself and take things slowly			0
do n't let the cheating experience define you			0

both @entity3 and @entity4 *slammed* other women in their partners ' lives
psychologist dr @entity149 and relationship expert @entity97 say this is a natural *reaction*
@entity58 , @entity16 and @entity68 have done the same
