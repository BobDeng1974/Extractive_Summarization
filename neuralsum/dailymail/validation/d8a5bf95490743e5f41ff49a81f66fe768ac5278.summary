video : scroll down to watch @entity0 's outburst @entity0 fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with @entity13 after concluding the press conference , @entity0 muttered ' waxing away , my a * * * ' under his breath he was then further angered by the suggestion his team ’s season was ‘ waxing or waning ’ with ten games left and seven points separating @entity7 from safety			1
‘ waxing or waning , f * * * * * * hell			1
my a * * * , ’ @entity0 is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the @entity42			1
as he gets up he appears to utter the word : ‘ p * * * *			1
’ @entity0 was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters			2
@entity0 does not countenance such dark arts			2
in a december interview he said : ' people who are more cynical - minded might say i ’m naive			2
' there is a concern at the @entity54 about the number of times that is happening			2
i hope my players do n’t start doing it			0
' there ’s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win			0
i ’d never cheat to win			0
' he is fiercely protective of his squad and , in any case , replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of @entity13 players arguing the opposite			0
the @entity7 manager then seemed to call the journalist a ' p * * * * ' for the line of questioning @entity0 looks frustrated during another game where his @entity7 side failed to win it is a third controversial incident for @entity0 this season			1
in december he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined £ 10,000 for telling a supporter to ‘ f * * * off and die ’ after receiving sustained abuse			1

@entity21 ’s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on saturday evening			0
the @entity13 manager said : ‘ there is a raging debate about @entity104 in midweek			2
i ’ve seen everybody surround @entity21 for a red card for his challenge			0
‘ for me it is a perfectly decent challenge i would expect a centre - half to make			0
the reason we enjoy the @entity54 is its honesty and integrity and if we ’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around , whinging , trying to get people yellow cards and red cards			2
for me it ’s not right			0
’ @entity0 was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism			1
‘ no , ’ he said , before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion , and swearing under his breath			1
@entity17 cited @entity104 in terms of the @entity7 players behaved to try and get @entity21 sent off … did they ? oh very nice			2
do you think that ’s a fair criticism ? no. what ’s your take on that situation ? i ’ve just said no. but what ’s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee ? how many times have you seen us play this year ? three times			0
well there you are then			0
you ’re not in a position to judge my players on that			0
i ’m not judging anyone			0
i ’m just asking you … you ’ve asked me and i ’ve told you			0
i do n’t think it ’s a fair assessment			0
do you consider that @entity7 ’s season is waxing or waning ? i do n’t have to use that sort of analogy			1
we are in the same position			0
we ’ve got ten games left , six games at home , and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance			0
you got any more questions you want to ask ? obviously not			0
waxing or waning , f * * * * * * hell			1
my a * * *			1
p * * * *			1
