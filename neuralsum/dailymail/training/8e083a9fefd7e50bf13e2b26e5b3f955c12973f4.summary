she 's famous for her broad smile and sparkling white teeth but an animated @entity3 proved that she 's not one to stand around and grin when there 's talking to be done			2
during this morning 's tour of @entity7 , the @entity5 showed off a full range of expressions , from big smiles to bashful glances			1

' @entity20 , who is six months pregnant , is due to give birth to her second child at the end of april but admitted that she and prince @entity36 still do n't know the sex of their unborn child			1
today 's animated pictures of the @entity5 are in stark contrast to those taken last monday , which showed a tired - looking @entity3 shopping in @entity45			1

there , an animated @entity3 chatted happily with foster parents and children , before declaring herself smitten with one adorable six - month - old baby girl			2
