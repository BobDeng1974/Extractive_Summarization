a father - of - three with motor neurone disease , whose ventilator prevents him from being able to speak , has been given the opportunity to communicate independently for the first time in 15 years			1
technology and media company , @entity5 , which was founded by @entity8 born @entity7 and @entity9 from @entity10 , made it their mission to ensure @entity13 was able to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife @entity16			1
a short documentary explaining the trials and tribulations of their project , captured the heart - warming moment the farmer from rural @entity23 was able to write his wife a love letter and tell her he loves her for the first time in 15 years			0
the disease forced him to rely on a wheelchair and in 1999 he was fitted with a ventilator to help him breathe			1
' i 'm not even sure he realised that he was n't going to be able to speak , but i remember explaining that to him : " if you go on the ventilator , you wo n't be able to speak anymore " , ' @entity16 said			0
' at that point , it was very difficult			0
' @entity13 's family did their best to adapt to his progressive illness and learnt how to run the family farm according to his instructions , but they remain humble about the emotional toll it has taken on them			1
' he 's constantly losing abilities every week , like what he could do last week he ca n't do this week and next week you know it 's going to be something else , but you do n't know what , ' @entity16 said			0
technology and media company , @entity5 , which was founded by @entity8 born @entity7 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) from @entity10 , designed the program to allow @entity13 to communicate independently mr @entity13 was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( @entity30 ) in 1995			1
the disease forced him to rely on a wheelchair and in 1999 he was fitted with a ventilator to help him breathe engineer and not impossible volunteer @entity60 was determined to help @entity13 communicate independently after hearing his story , but was set back due to the farmer 's lack of experience with technology			1
his wife explains in the documentary : ' @entity13 has never touched a computer , he does n't even know how to turn one on '			1
undeterred , mr @entity60 said : ' a year ago i made @entity13 a promise ; that i will find an answer that works for him specifically			2
' ' when i look at @entity13 - that could be my uncle , that could be my dad - what right do i have to do nothing about it			2
' the not impossible team thus created an electronic version of a letter - board chart that @entity13 and his wife had been using to communicate since he first lost the ability to speak			1
' i 'm not even sure he realised that he was n't going to be able to speak , but i remember explaining that to him ... at that point , it was very difficult , ' his wife @entity16 said @entity13 's family did their best to adapt to his progressive illness and @entity16 ( pictured ) learnt how to run the family farm according to his instructions , but they remain humble about the emotional toll it has taken on them ' @entity13 had a letter board that was divided up into four quadrants that enabled him to have a bit of shorthand with his wife and kids because when he looked into the corner on the left it could only be a certain letter that fit to form a certain word , ' @entity7 told @entity104			1
' due to his technology barrier , the program gave him a very familiar thing to look at because it looked just like his letter sheet and it would calibrate , so it would scroll through these letters and if he then looks to the centre it pulls the letter in to the centre			1
' not only does it speak the word or sentence for him , but it has got predictive text , just like our phones do , which continues to get smarter like our phones do , and that speeds up his communication			0
' it 's a new piece of technology also based on eye recognition and it 's really the software that 's the hero here			0
' after almost three years of development the program was finally complete in august 2014 and @entity13 was able to renew his vows			1
engineer and not impossible volunteer @entity60 was determined to help @entity13 communicate independently after hearing his story , but was set back due to the farmer 's lack of experience with technology ' @entity13 has never touched a computer , he does n't even know how to turn one on , ' @entity16 said ' my dear @entity16 , i ca n't imagine life without you			1
you have made the last 25 years fly by and the last 20 with @entity30 more bearable			0
i am looking forward to the next 25 years			0
' ' he was pretty excited			0
@entity16 told us : " he 's blinking like crazy ! " , ' mr @entity7 said			2
but the beauty of the program does not stop there			0
the tech geniuses are now working on designing a voice based on @entity13 's actual voice from old film footage of him in order to personalise the computer 's voice and minimise the robotic sounds			1
' the next stage they 're working on is for him to be able to email from the device so that he can keep in contact with friends and people you do n't get to see because you 're not as mobile as you used to be			0
he 'll be able to communicate with anyone in the world and not just the two people in the room with him , ' mr @entity7 said			1
the not impossible team thus created an electronic version of a letter - board chart that @entity13 and his wife had been using to communicate since he first lost the ability to speak the program is based on his letter sheet and calibrates - scrolling through letters and pulling them into the centre when he looks into the centre			1
it then speaks the word or sentence for him and also includes predictive text which continues to get smarter and speeds up his communication not impossible labs will also have the program available for download online by anyone , for free			1
' @entity60 wants to go around the whole country making custom interfaces for all sorts of people			0
like , for someone with tunnel vision , he wants to customise the program for them , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' @entity13 has @entity16 , but not everyone has a @entity16			2
we want people to look at all the technology available to them and know that they can use it and adapt it to make life a lot easier and convenient			0
we still are a really small team of people and we manage to deliver real impact on people 's lives and if we can inspire others to help someone in their community then it 's huge			0
' if we can make it downloadable to use for free then others can look at it and improve it so that there are local answers for people who are lacking communication tools			0
' @entity215 is just one of many projects that @entity5 currently has in the works			2
their process of helping people is a simple one : find a problem , solve it by bringing together the best creative minds , get big companies involved to fund the set up costs in exchange for exposure , make it a sustainable solution and then spread the message far and wide			0
the program allowed @entity13 to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with @entity16 not impossible labs will also have the program available for download online by anyone , for free			1
' [ now ] others can look at it and improve it so that there are local answers for people who are lacking communication tools , ' mr @entity7 said ' what happens is , people send us stories or we find stories where access has been limited to someone , ' mr @entity7 explained			2
' it could be physical limitations , like an inability to communicate , it could be geographic , or it could just be financial where the solution is not available because it 's just so expensive they ca n't afford it			0
as for @entity13 and @entity16 , while his independence has bene given a boost , the technology is only another chapter in their love story			2
' when he first used the program to say " i love you " , @entity16 said to us : " oh , you know , he tells me he loves me all the time " , ' mr @entity7 said			1
' they really are amazing			0
it 's hard to believe but they seem to really not have missed a beat			0
' @entity13 's program will be available for download here .			2

@entity13 can communicate independently for the first time since he was forced onto a ventilator in 1999 due to his illness
he was first diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1995
the computer program was created by technology and media company @entity5 , which was *co-founded* by @entity8 born @entity7
it will be available to anyone online in the hope that it continues to improve peoples ' lives
