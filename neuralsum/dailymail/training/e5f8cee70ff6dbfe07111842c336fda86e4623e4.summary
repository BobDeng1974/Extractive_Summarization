@entity1 's ‘ complacent ’ leadership is under assault from senior figures in his own party after a poll suggested the @entity6 have extended a new lead over @entity8			1
former deputy prime minister @entity9 , normally a fierce loyalist , condemned mr @entity1 for pursuing a ‘ core vote strategy of getting 31 per cent of traditional @entity8 supporters with a few @entity14 voters ’			1
and shadow chancellor @entity15 said it had been a ‘ mistake ’ for the @entity8 leader to forget to make any mention of @entity20 ’s vast budget deficit in his final party conference speech before the election			1
a poll by @entity35 showed the @entity6 moving into the lead for the first time in nearly three years , by just one point			0
yesterday , it published another survey suggesting the @entity6 are now up to 36 per cent , with @entity8 on 34 per cent			2
it also showed mr @entity42 has opened up a 42 - point lead over mr @entity1 on leadership , up from 31 last week			2
he is more trusted on almost every issue , with the @entity8 leader ahead only on the @entity46			1
the @entity8 leader may as well have told party activists to ' go back to your constituencies and prepare for @entity50 ' @entity15 insisted the @entity17 's speech was ' 10 out of 10 ' , but admitted it had been a mistake to not mention the deficit lord @entity9 shocked @entity54 by tearing into his party ’s approach as ‘ far too timid ’			1
writing in his @entity59 column , the former deputy prime minister mocked mr @entity1 ’s ‘ six - point ’ plan for ten years in @entity61			2
‘ can you remember what they were ? they were just one - line objectives , not detailed policies , ’ he said			0
attacking the strategy of trying to limp to an election win by appealing to core @entity8 voters plus some disaffected @entity70 , he added : ‘ he might as well have said at the end of his conference speech : “ go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition ”			1
’ mr @entity15 revealed that the @entity8 leader had told him after his disastrous conference speech that he had blundered			1
mr @entity1 has been ridiculed after forgetting to deliver planned remarks about the need to rein in the deficit in his address			2
‘ he said to me afterwards it was a mistake and it was , ’ the @entity15 told @entity83 ’s @entity82 programme			0
‘ but look , that kind of thing happens sometimes in politics			0
’ @entity8 mp @entity88 said there was an ‘ extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party ’			0
‘ @entity1 should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about , ’ he added			0
mr @entity88 claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the ‘ 35 per cent strategy ’ – winning the core @entity8 vote plus 4 or 5 per cent of former @entity70			0
‘ they seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory , ’ he added			0
@entity8 officials insist that polls suggest the party still has a strong lead in key marginal seats , and mr @entity1 ’s conference speech has helped push the @entity46 up the political agenda .			1

lord @entity9 *accuses* @entity8 leader of giving up trying to win *swing* voters
claims mr @entity1 's may as well have said ' prepare for @entity50 ' in speech
*praises* @entity118 fighting spirit ahead of the next election , but says @entity8 ' flat '
comes as @entity35 poll puts the @entity118 on 36 **%** , ahead of @entity8 on 34 **%**
