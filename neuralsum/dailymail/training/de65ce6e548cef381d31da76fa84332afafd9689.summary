by @entity0 published : 08:53 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 17 june 2013 warning : @entity1 , the @entity2 chief executive , warned today that it could take 10 years for the government to dispose of its 81 per cent stake in the bank the sale of state - owned @entity9 so taxpayers can be repaid their £ 45billion stake could drag on for a decade , according to its outgoing chief executive			1
@entity1 said that privatising the bank was a long - term project that could take until 2023			1
mr @entity1 was pushed out last week in a move approved by chancellor @entity16 , although he will pick up a golden goodbye worth up to £ 5.6million			1
he was brought in to run the bank after the @entity19 was forced to bail out @entity2 during the financial crisis five years ago by buying an 81 per cent stake			1
but mr @entity16 believes he is not the right person to guide the bank through privatisation			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it is clearly up to the government how it privatises , when it privatises and what the important features are			1
‘ my observation is that if the desired proceeds are £ 45billion , then there has never been a privatisation that raises that much in one go			2
it is likely that it would be , if you do it conventionally , four or five goes over ten years			0
‘ that ’s why i ’ve always been confident that the state would get its £ 45billion back			2
’ he said he would support a wholesale giveaway of shares to the public , in the style of the privatisation of @entity46 in the @entity47 , which was marketed with the ‘ @entity49 ’ ad campaign			2
mr @entity1 said that while such a giveaway was ‘ perfectly legitimate ’ , mr @entity16 had to consider the politics of the sale as well as the economics			1
he claimed he did not feel any anger over the manner of his departure , adding : ‘ i do n’t want to show frustration , i do n’t want to punch someone in the eye			0
sell - off : the government is hoping to recoup the full £ 45billion it spent bailing out the @entity9 at the height of the financial crisis ‘ i have n’t hidden from anyone that i am torn a bit at this juncture			1
‘ part of me did want to see the job fully through , did want the champagne and roses of a successful privatisation			0
another part of me thought , “ goodness me , this job drives me nuts from time to time and how long do i want to do it for ? ”			0
‘ i genuinely mean i am comfortable with what has happened			0
@entity2 is in much better shape than we had any right to think it could be			0
i want the company to have a good future and i want to pass the baton on smoothly and without rancour or difficulty			0
i am happy with this result			0
’ the @entity19 is said to agree that the sell - off will take a while			1
sources said last week it would take ‘ many years ’ to complete what would be the biggest privatisation in history			0
replacing mr @entity1 is expected to take at least six months , with mr @entity16 reportedly sharing the @entity2 board ’s view that the next chief executive must be prepared to stay on for at least five years			1
a £ 1 billion rescue plan for the co-operative 's troubled banking arm is set to be unveiled this week in a move likely to hit up to 5,000 small investors			1
the mutual has been racing to plug a shortfall of up to £ 1.5 billion in its finances identified by the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , the new @entity105 watchdog			2
it is likely to do so through the disposal of its insurance business and a portfolio of loans , although the @entity112 said a large part of the cash is expected to come from bondholders			0
this would impact more than 5,000 investors who lent money to the co-op through securities called permanent interest bearing shares that pay dividends of up to 13 per cent a year			2
as much as 30 per cent of their cash could be wiped out or transferred into a new vehicle , it was reported			0
no taxpayers ' money will be involved and the co-op will be spared from having to sell other assets in the wider group , such as its pharmacy chain			2
the black hole in the co-op 's capital reserves largely stems from commercial property loans acquired through a merger with the @entity138 in 2009 that created a financial ' super-mutual ' .			0
