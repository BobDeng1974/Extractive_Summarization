@entity0 has warned @entity1 may have to endure further short - term pain before they can finally turn their ailing season around			1
though there was some good news for @entity0 on friday when @entity6 signed a new incentivised five - year contract , which could see him earn up to £ 150,000 per week , there are still a number of issues for the @entity1 manager to solve			1
chief among them is how he sparks an upturn in @entity1 ’s form			1
they have not won in the @entity16 since august 31 and their @entity18 aspirations are in jeopardy after an anaemic performance in @entity21 that @entity0 branded ‘ soft ’			1
‘ it ’s hard for the supporters and i understand that , ’ said @entity0 , who is considering giving @entity38 his first @entity16 start for @entity1 today			1
‘ it must be so difficult to see a team that for 18 months has been so fluent and dynamic			0
now they probably look and see a team with maybe no resemblance to that in many ways			0
‘ i understand that and there is no - one more frustrated			0
we look at our game , which is based a lot on possession , but we ’re also a big threat in transition when we ’ve won the ball back and we ’re on the break			2
we do n’t look a threat at the moment			0
@entity21 captain @entity61 scored the only goal of the game in their 1 - 0 victory vs @entity1 on wednesday ' i think the pain is for now			1
we lost a top - class player ( @entity68 ) and then had to bring in other players to help us now and for the future			2
once these players settle in and adapt , and really understand how we work , we ’ll move back to where we were			1
‘ there will be frustration now , absolutely			0
no - one respects that more than me			0
we have to work hard to get them settled and bedded in			0
these are players we believe will be outstanding but sometimes it takes a wee bit of time			2
’ @entity6 certainly has faith that @entity0 will find the formula to get @entity1 winning again and he revealed that his decision to extend his contract to the summer of 2019 was based on his belief that he will compete for the major honours			1
@entity1 's star striker @entity6 signed a new incentivised five - year contract at the club on friday ‘ we were so close to success last season and it was a bitter pill to take not winning the league , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ but that ’s just a taster of what the fans will get — but hopefully this time we ’ll have the trophies to show for it			0
‘ everyone is very obsessive in terms of wanting success and being winners			0
that ’s what we are — that ’s the @entity1 way			2
it ’s the @entity1 way of life			2
the way the manager wants us to implement his style , his football , i think we will have success in the future and i ’m just looking forward to those days when we ’ll be lifting trophies and celebrating			0
’ @entity6 believes the @entity34 outfit will be competing for major honours in the future			1

@entity1 boss @entity0 has admitted the club are going through a bad patch at present
@entity34 outfit have not won in the @entity16 since august 31
@entity124 ' @entity18 hopes are in the *balance* too after losing to @entity21
@entity0 believes their luck will *change* once the new players settle in
