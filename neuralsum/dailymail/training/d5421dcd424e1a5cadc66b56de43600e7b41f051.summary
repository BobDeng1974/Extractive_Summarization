forget the @entity3 , the latest plans for a skyscraper in @entity2 would not only give fantastic views of the city but these views could change every hour and a half because the building rotates			1
an @entity10 architect has revealed the ambitious plans to create @entity12 in cities around the world with separate floors that spin 360 degrees around a concrete centre every 90 minutes			1
the first two are planned to be built in @entity18 and @entity19 with other cities including @entity2 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 on the cards too			1
an @entity10 architect has designed a series of rotating skyscrapers for cities including @entity2 , @entity22 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
each floor is made of apartments that spin around a concrete centre once every 90 minutes the brainchild behind the plans is dr @entity36 from @entity37 who owns the @entity39			1
he said he was inspired to create the perpetual motion skyscrapers after soaking in the view from a friend 's apartment in @entity44			0
on his website he claims it is a new era for architecture : ' for the first time ever , buildings will be able to become part of life			0
' buildings will have four dimensions , adding the dimension of ' time ''			0
each of the @entity12 are also designed to be self - sustaining and can generate electricity from wind and solar power			1
up to 79 wind turbines will be fitted to each floor to generate enough energy to fuel the building 's electricity			1
@entity36 also claims that the buildings will be able to identify changes in climate and temperature and regulate energy through the building 's surface			2
towers are planned for @entity19 , pictured , as well as @entity2 , @entity18 , @entity22 , @entity21 and @entity24			1
the ' intelligent ' buildings will also be able to manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter , for example the ' intelligent ' building can manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter , for example			0
by controlling this automatically @entity36 claims it can ensure ' indoor comfort while reducing energy consumption			2
' plans for the @entity12 were first unveiled in 2008 with a start date of 2010			0
delays in planning permission and structural design tweaks are said to have pushed this back ' over the next two decades our energy infrastructure will undergo changes similar to those which rippled through the media and telecommunication industries over the past twenty years			2
' just like the cell phone revolution of the early 1990s , when the first generation wireless telecommunications quickly saturated the analog network , so too will digitalization pervade the purchase , generation , transportation and usage of all sorts of energy			2
' dr. @entity36 's @entity107 project is innovative in design and architecture , but also recognizes environmental care and industrial production process as key points in the city of the future			0
the plans were released in 2008 and @entity36 planned to have the first building in @entity18 completed by 2010			1
however , delays in planning permission as well as structural design tweaks and problems with how the plumbing would work , for example , is said to have pushed this date back			0
although , dr @entity36 believes each floor will only take six days to assemble around the core once permission is granted and the concrete structures are in place			2
each of the towers have been designed with swimming pools , gardens and even lifts for cars meaning people can park outside their flats			0
the 80 - storey @entity18 tower is expected to cost around Â£ 355million while the 70 - storey @entity19 tower will be developed by the @entity139 with final costs unknown			1
details of the other towers have not been released and specific details about planning permission for all of the towers as well as expected start and completion dates have not yet been announced			0
@entity36 previously said that he did not want to unveil too much information because he wanted it to be kept a ' surprise			0

each @entity151 has *individual* floors that rotate at different speeds
apartments on each floor spin around a concrete centre every 90 minutes
wind turbines and solar *panels* are fitted to the towers to *provide* energy
towers are planned for @entity2 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity22
