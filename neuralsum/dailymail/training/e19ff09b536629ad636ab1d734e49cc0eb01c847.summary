by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 5 april 2013 overweight people have an in - built ‘ fat - nav ’ that helps them remember where high - calorie food is , a study suggests			1
the discovery comes after psychologists at the @entity8 asked 41 students to imagine they were going to a food fair			1
they were then shown images of fruit and vegetables and high - calorie snacks , and briefly shown the location of stalls selling them			2
in tests , those who were better at remembering where to buy fatty snacks were more likely to have a higher body mass index – which compares height with weight			1
overweight people have an in - built ' fat - nav ' that helps them remember where high - calorie food is the trait may have helped our ancestors survive when food was in short supply , by pointing them towards energy - rich options			1
the latest research suggests it may explain why some find it so hard to resist over-consumption of calorie dense snacks , even though food is in @entity39 has emerged as a major burden on the @entity41			2
recent figures showed the number of people admitted to hospital for obesity - related illnesses has shot up by more than 10 times in the past decade			0
these range from surgery to have gastric bands fitted or undergo gastric bypass procedures , to weight - related ailments such as breathing difficulties and even organ failure			0
health experts predict @entity57 ’s obesity epidemic will cost the @entity41 and the economy £ 60bn annually by 2050			0
previous research has highlighted that both men and women have a better spatial memory for high calorie foods instead of low calorie ones			0
spatial memory is where we store information about our immediate environment			0
when our predecessors were foraging for foods , the ability to recall the location of energy - rich items would have been crucial for survival			1
the research found that students who were better at remembering where to buy fatty snacks had a higher body mass index the latest research , led by dr @entity82 , from the @entity83 at @entity8 , looked at whether there was a direct link between this evolutionary trait and body mass index , a measure of weight compared to height			1
he recruited 41 female students with body mass index ratings varying from 18.5 to 30			2
anything between 18 and 25 is judged to be healthy but a score of 30 or more is classed as @entity96 chose women for the study because the evidence suggests they have a better memory for the location of ‘ gatherable ’ foodstuffs than men			0
the volunteers were told to imagine they were at an international food fair with 24 stalls			0
they were then shown images of either healthy fruit and vegetables or calorie - loaded snacks and the location of the stall selling them , before these details were taken away from them			2
participants were asked to think about how desirable each food item was and to try and remember where on the map each one came from			2
the results , published online in the journal @entity123 , showed women who were better able to remember which stalls sold the snack foods were also more likely to have a higher body mass index			0
in a report on their findings the researchers said : ‘ improved spatial memory for high - calorie snacks predicted higher and less healthy body mass index			1
‘ in contrast , no significant relationship existed between women ’s @entity136 and spatial memory for fruits and vegetables			1
‘ these findings reveal , for the first time to our knowledge , a link between spatial memory function and weight gain in the modern urban food environment			0

researchers at @entity8 gave 41 students memory test
those who could remember where to buy fatty snacks had higher @entity136
@entity158 may have pointed our ancestors towards energy - rich food
