banks will be hit with an extra £ 1billion tax until the deficit has been completely cleared , under new @entity4 proposals			1
the new 8 per cent levy - which effectively strips the banks of the benefit of the government 's corporation tax cuts – will form a key plank of the party 's election manifesto			1
treasury secretary @entity13 said the tax hike will help the next @entity9 find the £ 30billion of savings after the election needed to balance the books			1
the @entity4 economic spokesman @entity13 wants to introduce a new 8 per cent levy on banks like the @entity21 , the @entity4 are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18			1
but unlike the @entity24 - who say they would do it through spending cuts alone - the @entity4 say they would seek to raise at least £ 8 billion through extra taxes			1
the annual levy on banks , which was introduced in 2010 , currently brings in around £ 2.5billion a year			1
mr @entity13 's proposals are expected to take that up to £ 3.5billion a year			0
a ' mansion tax ' on homes worth over £ 2million will raise an extra £ 1.5billion , and a crackdown on tax avoidance could save £ 6billion , the @entity4 claim			1
the @entity4 economic spokesman said : ' failings in the banking system were a major factor in the great crash of 2008			0
' that 's why we have always insisted that the banks help fund repairing the economy			0
' to that end , we introduced the @entity48 which is on track to raise £ 8billion in this @entity50			1
' with the final stage of deficit reduction requiring around £ 30billion of savings , it would be totally wrong for all of that to be found from cuts to public services as the @entity21 propose			2
' @entity4 believe that we must balance the books and do so fairly , so it is only right to reconsider whether banks are making a fair contribution to deficit reduction			2
' this tax would remain in place until that job is complete			0
' the @entity24 and @entity4 are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18			1
but the @entity4 want to raise at least £ 8 billion through extra taxes , while @entity69 ( pictured ) insists it can be achieved through spending cuts alone all the revenue raised from the new bank tax will go towards paying down the deficit			1
the @entity4 will push for the measure to be included in the forthcoming budget – but if the @entity24 resist , it will be included in the @entity4 manifesto			0
mr @entity13 added : ' many banks were left seriously weakened after the crash			0
' but as a result of our comprehensive range of reforms , and the strong economic recovery , the banking sector is now returning to health and profitability			0
' so now is the right time to ask the sector to contribute a little more to help us balance the nation 's books			0
that 's the right way to keep our strong economy on track , and build a fairer society too			0
' industry group the @entity99 criticised the proposal , saying that banks in the @entity102 already pay more tax than any other industry			2
@entity106 's shadow treasury secretary @entity105 added : ' nobody will trust what the @entity4 say after they broke their promises on tax by raising vat on families while giving millionaires a huge tax cut			2
' @entity106 will introduce a tax on bank bonuses to pay for a jobs programme for young people			0
we 'll reverse this government 's £ 3billion a year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners to help get the deficit down fairly			2
' and we 'll increase the bank levy , which has raised over £ 2billion less than the government promised , to pay for more free childcare for working parents			2
the @entity4 have joined the @entity24 in opposing all these fair policies			0

banks will have to pay a new 8 *%* annual levy until 2017/18 to clear deficit
tax hike will help the next @entity9 find £ 30bn of savings after election
tories and @entity4 committed to clearing deficit within three years
but @entity140 has vowed to make all the savings through spending cuts
@entity4 dems want at least £ 8billion of new tax rises , including a mansion tax
