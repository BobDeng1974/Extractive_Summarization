@entity6 footballer @entity5 amazed fans by tucking away ' the best penalty ever ' with a nifty back heel			1
the 21 - year - old ran up like any other spot - kick but moments before he was about to make contact he quickly spun and round took the penalty backwards			1
heely good : @entity15 star @entity5 back heels the ball past the goalkeeper in what fans are calling the ' best penalty ever ' @entity5 's unorthodox shot wrong - footed the goalkeeper who could only look on as the ball rolled into the net			1
but @entity5 's celebrations were cut short when he was booked for showboating and substituted by his manager - who had only brought him on three minutes earlier - for showing a ' lack of respect '			1
the impressive show of nerve and skill has become an internet sensation after the international friendly between the @entity15 and @entity35 in @entity36 on sunday			2
uae were leading 5 - 2 when @entity5 stepped up to take the penalty			1
his successful conversion put his side 6 - 2 in front			2
tricky : @entity5 calms his nerves moments before the penalty , and right , an angle from behind the goal shows how the keeper guessed the wrong way and was wrong - footed back heel to basics : @entity5 quickly spun round moments before kicking the ball to put his side 6 - 2 up against @entity35 in the international friendly but manager @entity15 coach @entity54 was so incensed that he substituted hauled him off the field to give him a dressing down			1
@entity54 said : ‘ this penalty , i did n’t like it			0
we must respect players from other teams			0
in future , you do n’t know what football will give you back			0
' this is not respect			0
he ’s a young guy and he knows he made a mistake immediately			1
i just want him to show respect , not just on the field but off it as well			1
’ but the opposition manager did not have a problem with the spot - kick			2
' i did n’t feel it was an insult , ' @entity35 ’s coach @entity75 said			0
run up : the showboating sub , who had only been on the field for three minutes , runs up to the spot - kick is he mad ? the other players look on in disbelief as the 21 - year - old goes for the back heel back of the net : the wrong - footed goalkeeper is left standing as the ball rolls over the line in the 7 - 2 drumming on sunday ' this is a personal decision the player made and it has nothing to do with the way the @entity15 plays its football			1
' the bizarre goal has become an internet hit - with legions of football fans heralding it as the ' best penalty ever '			0
one internet user wrote : ' what a classic goal			0
he was pretty brave to attempt such an extravagant penalty			0
' another added : ' this was a courageous trick and the goalkeeper froze completely			0
' one said : ' how many times had he practised this one in training ? '			0

he was immediately given a *yellow* card and taken off by angry manager
substitute @entity5 , 21 , had only been on the field for three minutes
