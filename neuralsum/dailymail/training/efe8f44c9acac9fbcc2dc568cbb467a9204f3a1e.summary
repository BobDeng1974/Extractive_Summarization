doctors in @entity1 will be allowed to keep terminally ill patients sedated until death comes under new plans terminally ill patients could be sedated until they die under plans in @entity1 to end suffering in the last stages of their life			1
the laws would give people the ' right to deep , continuous sedation until death ' at patients ' request - and only when their condition is life - threatening in the short term			1
the @entity1 parliament will debate a draft law on the highly sensitive issue from january , president @entity17 has revealed			1
although euthanasia is not permitted in @entity1 , laws were passed in 2005 that allows for ' passive euthanasia ' , where a person causes death by withdrawing or withholding treatment			2
outlining how the new laws would go a step further , @entity17 said current legislation was too focused on the doctor 's analysis and did not consider the patient 's wishes			2
but he stopped short of recommending lethal injections and avoided the terms euthanasia and assisted suicide			1
' these proposals are centred on the patients whose suffering should be avoided			0
it respects their choice and wishes , ' @entity17 said			0
apart from @entity45 , the @entity46 and @entity47 , few countries in the world explicitly permit euthanasia or assisted suicide			1
the issue is contentious in @entity1 where debate has raged over whether terminally ill patients suffering in the last stages of their life should be allowed to die			1
@entity17 promised before his 2012 election to introduce new right - to - die legislation in @entity1 , which left grey areas in a 2005 law on patient rights and care for the terminally ill. the @entity60 law currently limits ' therapeutic obstinacy ' , or treatments that only prolong the life of a terminally ill patient without providing a cure			1
@entity17 said the new proposals would mean that if a patient 's life was immediately in danger and the treatment was not working or causing more suffering then they could be sedated			2
if a patient was unable to decide alone , then the doctor - with consultation - would have an obligation to end treatment because it would only be keeping the patient artificially alive , @entity17 said			2
he added that if a person had indicated either before falling seriously ill or during their sickness how they wished to die then doctors should take account of those instructions			0
@entity1 president @entity17 ( pictured ) delivers his speech about reform of end - of - life treatment at the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity1 ' advance directives in which everyone can stipulate refusal of aggressive treatment for serious illness would be " binding " under these proposals , ' @entity17 said			1
opinion polls show broad support for legalised euthanasia in late terminal cases			0
hospital staff convicted of helping patients die in recent years have often been given suspended sentences in view of this approach			0
the issue gained prominence after an elderly couple took their own lives in a luxury @entity85 hotel in 2013 leaving a note explaining that they had wanted to die with dignity			0
' these proposals are balanced and realistic			0
they aim to stop the suffering of those close to the end of their lives , respect their wishes and allows the right to die in dignity , ' @entity17 said .			0
