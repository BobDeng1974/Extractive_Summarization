by @entity0 girls who post pictures of themselves in revealing outfits online are seen as less attractive by other females , researchers have found			1

researchers set up a series of fake @entity8 profiles to test their findings			1
women who post revealing snaps are viewed by their female peers as less attractive , and less competent			1
researchers created two mock @entity8 profiles for the fictitious 20 - year - old @entity20			1
in both versions , @entity20 liked musicians such as @entity23 , books such as ' @entity25 , ' and movies like ' @entity27 , ' that would be appropriate for a person her age			2
the only difference between the two was the profile photo			1
the photos were actual high school senior portrait and prom photos of a real young woman who allowed the photos to be used for the experiment			2
in the sexy photo , “ @entity20 ” is wearing a low - cut red dress with a slit up one leg to mid-thigh and a visible garter belt			2
in the non-sexy photo , she ’s wearing jeans , a short - sleeved shirt and a scarf draped around her neck , covering her chest			2
' this is a clear indictment of sexy social media photos , said @entity53 of the @entity54 , who led the study			2
' there is so much pressure on teen girls and young women to portray themselves as sexy , but sharing those sexy photos online may have more negative consequences than positive , ' @entity53 said			0
girls and young women are in a ' no - win ' situation when it comes to their @entity8 photos , @entity53 said			1
those who post sexy photos may risk negative reactions from their peers , but those who post more wholesome photos may lose out on social rewards , including attention from boys and men , she said			1
' social media is where the youth are , ” she said			0
' we need to understand what they ’re doing online and how that affects their self - concept and their self - esteem			0
' @entity53 ’ research was published today in the journal ' @entity87			0
' participants were asked to assess @entity20 ’s physical attractiveness ( i think she is pretty ) , social attractiveness ( i think she could be a friend of mine ) , and task competence ( i have confidence in her ability to get a job done ) on a scale from 1 - 7 , with one being strongly disagree and 7 being strongly agree			0
those who post sexy photos may risk negative reactions from their peers , but those who post more wholesome photos may lose out on social rewards , including attention from boys and men , she said			1
in all three areas , the non-sexy profile scored higher , indicating that those who viewed that photo thought @entity20 was prettier , more likely to make a good friend and more likely to complete a task			1
the largest difference was in the area of task competence , suggesting a young woman ’s capabilities are really affected by the sexy photo , @entity53 said			0
' we really need to help youth understand this is a very public forum , ' she said			0
@entity53 ’ advice for girls and young women is to select social media photos that showcase their identity rather than her appearance , such as one from a trip or one that highlights participation in a sport or hobby			0
' do n’t focus so heavily on appearance , ' @entity53 said			0
' focus on who you are as a person and what you do in the world			0
