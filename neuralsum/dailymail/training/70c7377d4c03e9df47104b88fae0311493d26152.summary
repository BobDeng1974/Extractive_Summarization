’ after giving @entity9 food and water , a police officer played with the dog in the garden while waiting for staff from @entity49 to collect him			2
but after examining @entity9 , a @entity49 vet said the dog – which had been without food , water and medication to treat his mild arthritis for up to five days – should be put down			1
the vet described @entity9 as bloated , distressed and in pain			2
mrs @entity2 ’s friends say that was not surprising , given the circumstances in which eight - year - old @entity9 was found last february , and claim he was not given a ‘ proper chance ’			1
neighbour @entity63 , 74 , said : ‘ @entity2 was devoted to her dog			2
she took him regularly to the vet , and only the month before she died she told me @entity9 ’s anti-inflammatory drug for his arthritis had been reduced , which was a good sign			2

‘ people who saw @entity9 with @entity2 all confirm his mobility			2

@entity107 , @entity49 ’s director of fundraising , added : ‘ the decision to put @entity9 to sleep was taken by a very experienced vet , in whom we have absolute faith			2
