by @entity0 , political correspondent @entity1 faces a crucial test on the world stage next week as he is due to meet @entity4 at the @entity5			1
meetings between an opposition leader and the @entity9 president are a high - stakes affair , and have been described as a ‘ job interview for being prime minister ’			1
it is expected mr @entity4 will grant mr @entity1 a short meeting on monday , known as a ‘ brush by ’ , during which the president will drop in on a meeting between the @entity19 leader and high - level @entity9 officials			1
@entity1 laughs at @entity4 's quip the last time the pair met in 2011 , when the @entity9 president visited @entity23			1
the leader of the opposition is set to meet @entity4 again next week at the @entity5 this is typical for an opposition leader and is the same level of courtesy offered to @entity29 when he met @entity30 in 2008			1
mr @entity1 is said to have been keen for some time to make a @entity5 trip , in an effort to convince sceptical voters he can be prime ministerial			1
but it 's not known whether the @entity24 will swing by @entity36 afterwards to visit his brother @entity37 , who was last night hobnobbing with the stars			2
the former @entity19 foreign secretary , a staunch @entity39 who was beaten to party 's top spot after his younger sibling secured the support of the unions , was at a summer party hosted by the @entity46 , the aid organisation he has run since 2010			0
the lavish event in @entity36 's @entity49 drew stars including @entity52 actress @entity51 , celebrity chef @entity53 , and @entity55 actress @entity54			0
@entity56 at the @entity57 at the @entity49 last night in @entity36			0
left with chef @entity58 and @entity53 , and right cuddling up with broadway actress @entity51 mr @entity1 has been the president and chief executive of the @entity46 since quitting @entity63 politics in 2010 after he was beaten in the @entity19 leadership race by his brother @entity65 but while @entity37 is riding high on the @entity36 social scene , @entity65 's visit to @entity67 , which has not yet been officially confirmed , could be a media minefield			1
@entity71 ’s meeting with @entity72 just before the 1987 general election turned to disaster when the president then publicly expressed concerns about the then @entity19 leader ’s views on nuclear disarmament			2
mr @entity1 ’s decision to scupper military action in @entity82 last summer may well have burned some bridges in the @entity9			2
@entity1 has hired @entity84 , right , as an election advisor			0
mr @entity84 used to work for the president @entity88 , a former aide to mr @entity4 , said last week the debacle , in which @entity29 ’s plan for air strikes was dramatically defeated , had left ‘ bruises ’ in @entity67			2
the @entity19 leader is also expected make a speech to a @entity67 think tank detailing how @entity19 and the @entity96 think similarly about how to share the proceeds of economic growth			0
he is said to be hoping that the links between the @entity96 and the @entity19 , as well as the fact that his strategist @entity84 used to work for the president , will smooth the way			0
mr @entity1 has not made many diplomatic visits			0
his first high profile foreign trip as opposition leader earlier this year , to @entity108 and the @entity110 territories , was seen as successful			0
@entity71 's meeting with @entity72 in 1986 was a disaster for the @entity113 after the @entity9 president attacked the party 's policy on nuclear disarmament mr @entity1 and mr @entity4 have met before , when the president visited @entity23 in 2011 and could meet again at a @entity120 summit in @entity121 in september			1
the ongoing crisis in @entity82 , and the pull - out of troops from @entity125 , which mr @entity1 would have to oversee if he wins the next election , are likely to be high on the agenda			0
the last @entity19 opposition leader to have a successful first trip to the @entity5 , which paved the way for becoming prime minister , was @entity132 in 1996			1
mr @entity132 ’s former chief of staff @entity133 recently warned that such visits have to run like clockwork , as it is ‘ the nearest the leader of the opposition gets to a job interview for prime minister ’			1
@entity140 was said to have been ‘ snubbed ’ when he met mr @entity4 at the @entity141 in @entity36 in 2009			2
it was claimed the president refused five requests for a private meeting with him			0
they only met finally in a bizarre ‘ kitchen summit ’ at the @entity141 building .			0
