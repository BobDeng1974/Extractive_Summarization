by @entity0 a mystery portrait of an unknown @entity3 soldier has finally been identified - 100 years after his death			1
for years the painting of the unknown soldier hung in @entity7 in @entity8 but no one knew his name or if he survived the horror of the trenches			1
it remained a mystery until an amateur historian posted a picture of the painting on the @entity19 website and asked for help to uncover his identity			1
for years this painting hung in @entity7 in @entity8 but no one knew the soldier 's name - until a team of historians looked him up historians scoured obituaries in wartime archive @entity30 and were astounded to see a photograph of the young soldier identical to the face staring out from the oil painting			1
the soldier was identified as second lieutenant @entity36 who was just 18 when he was killed			0

together they identified the cap badge , unique double leather shoulder straps and button - badge on the lapel , as belonging to a second lieutenant in the @entity64 and @entity49			0
the fact the officer did n't have any medals in the portrait led mr @entity51 to think it was painted early in the war as a memorial to a fallen soldier			1
