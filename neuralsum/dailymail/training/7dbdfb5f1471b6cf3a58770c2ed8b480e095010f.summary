by @entity0 last updated at 5:55 pm on 2nd march 2012 a smartphone made out of bamboo has been designed by a @entity4 student			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , plans to release his product in the @entity4 and throughout @entity10 later this year			1
the 23 - year - old , who studies product design at @entity13 , was frustrated with the lack of variety in the mobile phone market so designed the bamboo handset in his own time			1
@entity6 - @entity5 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , plans to release his product in the @entity4 and throughout @entity10 later this year made from four - year - old organically - grown bamboo , which has been specially treated to ensure durability , the @entity19 runs on the @entity24 operating system and is about half the size of an @entity26			1
like many phones it will include a camera , but @entity19 features technology called a ‘ ring flash ’ not available on any current mobile phone			2
a circular photographic flash around the camera ’s lens ensures very even illumination and minimises shadows			0
mr @entity5 said he had been overwhelmed with support for his product			0
he said : ' @entity39 may seem like a strange material to use for a phone , but it ’s actually extremely strong and very durable , perfect qualities for this kind of application			2
mr @entity5 was frustrated with the lack of variety in the mobile phone market so designed the bamboo handset in his own time ' the whole experience so far has been incredible and completely unexpected			1
i ca n’t wait to see my mobile phone in shops this year			2
' mr @entity5 designed the phone initially just for the @entity56 market			1
he picked bamboo , which must be four - years - old , as it is a sustainable material that can be sourced locally			0
however , he was surprised to discover many people were fans of his design at @entity60 last year and he decided to publicise his work on the internet			0
this led to him being contacted by technology entrepreneur @entity64 and it will now be sold in the @entity4			2
as well as being food for pandas , bamboo is used in @entity69 for furniture and grows quickly			0
dr @entity71 , mr @entity5 's tutor and @entity13 ’s product design and engineering director of programmes , said : ' the web has opened up the highly competitive design sphere and enabled those with talent to get noticed more easily			0
' @entity79 is a remarkable designer and has made the most of the opportunities @entity13 has provided , which put him in good stead to make his new company a real success			0

student made the handset in his spare time
he hopes to *launch* the phone on the @entity4 market
