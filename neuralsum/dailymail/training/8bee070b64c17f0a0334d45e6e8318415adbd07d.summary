by @entity0 published : 16:26 est , 12 september 2012 updated : 09:53 est , 13 september 2012 despite the excitement surrounding the new @entity3 , many users will be left frustrated as it includes a controversial new ' docking connector ' which will render thousands of @entity7 accessories obsolete			1
with the new model , @entity7 is ditching the docking port connector it 's used for @entity10 , iphones and @entity12 for nearly a decade in favor of a smaller , narrower one			1
the newer , slimline port means that thousands of current @entity7 accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the ' @entity3 ' - or become unusable			1
according to the website @entity19 , the new ' lightning to 30 - pin ' adapter will cost about £ 18 while a 0.2m cable version of the adapter will cost £ 24			0
speaking at today 's launch , @entity36 , @entity7 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing , said : ' ‘ the iphone from its start used the 30 pin connector , and it has served us well			2
a lot has changed and it is time for the connector to evolve - and our new connector is called @entity29			0
’ many fans were left angry last month when images allegedly showing the @entity3 's new design leaked out , showing the traditional 30 - pin dock connector - used for charging , syncing files and pumping audio to hi - fis - had been re-designed into a smaller shape			1
change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity3 , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete @entity65 and new : the current @entity3 is shown with the prototype of the @entity3 's outer casing the new port looks similar to micro usb , the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however it is very unlikely that @entity7 will support this standard , despite moves by the @entity75 to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable			1
@entity7 's version has a triangle - shaped wedge at one end , which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round			0
@entity87 fans may spot a superficial similarity to a @entity90 port , which is used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed			0
popular : but @entity3 users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device useless : the $ 850 @entity97 8 is designed to work with the current @entity3 's design the ' @entity100 ' slot , containing the sim card which connects a phone to the carrier network , has also been redesigned to be thinner , although this will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will provide replacements sims if necessary			2
there are also rumours , reported on @entity111 , that the @entity12 3 , which was released in the @entity112 , will get a slight tweak this autumn to brink the dock connector in - line with the rest of the range			0
obsolete : the @entity120 speaker , left , and the @entity121 10 , right , are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the @entity3			0
