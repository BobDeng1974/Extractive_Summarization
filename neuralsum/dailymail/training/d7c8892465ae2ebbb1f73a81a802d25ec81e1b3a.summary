@entity8 , 41 , uprooted his wife , and their five children , from their home @entity12 , @entity13 , in order to move them to @entity16 , after the now - infamous prankster 's celebrity status in their local area left him unable to film his normal hidden - camera comedy series without being spotted			1
' we knew we had to go somewhere because we were being recognized , ' the @entity1 star told @entity24			1
' and in addition to keeping his @entity1 content fresh and interesting , @entity8 admits his family 's move to @entity42 was also motivated by another factor : his new @entity45 reality series @entity8 : offline			1

' but i only realized it was an actual possibility a couple of years ago , when people started getting in touch saying that they 'd like to pay to feature clips from my videos on their shows and so on			0
' that was when i started to think that maybe this dream could become a reality			0
' while is show is built around practical jokes and pranking , @entity8 is adamant that the content , which includes everything from dressing as @entity131 and passing wind in an elevator to prank - calling people on @entity135 , is all completely family - friendly			2
