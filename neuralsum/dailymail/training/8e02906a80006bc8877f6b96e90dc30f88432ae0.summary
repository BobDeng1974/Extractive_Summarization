@entity1 self - testing kits could soon be for sale in the @entity3			1
a change in @entity3 law means that from sunday it will be legal to sell the home testing kits			1
however , it is unlikely that any will be seen on the shelves until late this year or early next year			2
from sunday it will be legal to sell @entity1 self - testing kits in the @entity3			1
image shows the hiv virus in human tissue this is because none have currently been approved for sale in the @entity3 or the @entity16			1
currently , people can take @entity1 tests at home but they have to send a saliva , or blood , sample to a lab which will give them their results after the sample has been analysed			0
the change in the law means people will be able to buy tests that give them an immediate result that they can read themselves			0
the tests work by analysing saliva samples that people take with a swab and are easily read from the test kits by people with no medical knowledge or training			0
the law was changed in an attempt to ensure more people who are @entity1 positive are diagnosed and that they are diagnosed early			2
this is important because about 25 per cent of @entity1 positive people in the @entity3 do not know they are @entity1 positive and these are the people most likely to pass on the infection			1
it is also important to ensure people are diagnosed as early as possible to make treatment as effective as it can be			0
@entity48 , medical director at @entity49 , said : ‘ we welcome this change in the law , which will give people another choice about how and where they test for @entity1			0
currently , if people want to be tested for @entity1 they have to go to a doctor or a nurse			0
alternatively they can take a blood or saliva sample at home and send it to a lab for analysis ‘ the success of our @entity1 postal testing scheme has shown that many people who have never tested before , or who have been putting off a visit to the clinic , are willing to test at home			2
‘ with @entity1 transmission in the @entity3 largely driven by the 22,000 people who remain undiagnosed , anything that provides them with another option to test and access effective treatment is welcome			2
‘ it is vital that @entity1 self - testing kits offer high quality information , including how to obtain practical and emotional support and how to quickly access specialist @entity1 services			1
‘ we will be working closely with manufacturers to ensure that any kit that comes to market meets the very best standards of patient information			0

from sunday it will be legal to sell @entity1 self - testing kits in the @entity3
they are unlikely to be available until late 2014 or early 2015
this is because there are currently none approved for sale in the @entity3
