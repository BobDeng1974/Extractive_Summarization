fishermen in one corner of @entity2 face an official crackdown on their technique of using home - made bombs to blast fish out of the water			1
so - called ' blast fishing ' is outlawed in many countries because of the destructive and unpredictable effect it can have on the marine ecosystems that support fish stocks			1
but the practise is nonetheless thriving in @entity16 , by the city of @entity18 , on the @entity20 coast of @entity22 province , south - east @entity2			1
visitors there can even pay to go out with the fishermen and throw a few bombs in the water themselves			2
their target in these snaps are yellow croakers that they head out to catch every november			0
but the explosions also kill other sea life in the area and severely damage the underlying habitat			0
underwater shockwaves from the explosions stun fish and rupture their swim bladders - the tiny gas - filled organs that help fish to control their buoyancy			1
the rupturing causes an abrupt loss of buoyancy , so while a small number of fish float to the surface , many more sink to the sea floor , where they join any other marine organisms indiscriminately killed by the blasts			2
controversial : blast fishing is outlawed in many countries because of the damage is cases to marine life sledgehammer : the fisherman are after yellow croakers but end up killing many more creatures as well taking a break : these pictures show fishermen who allegedly use blast fishing to make their catches poor living : a @entity92 spokesman said the fishermen make more from tourists than fish now the irresponsible practise has also become a tourist attraction			1
horrified angler @entity98 , 32 , who unwittingly signed up to a trip in @entity16 , said : ' we saw an advert promising ' fishing action '			1
' we assumed it meant fun and paid the 30 gbp to have a go			0
' we 'd been out for about 30 minutes when the men told us they were going to feed the fishes			0
' they were laughing and stuffing the bottles with powder and what looked like stones			0
' they then threw them overboard and just seconds later there was a huge serious of explosions			0
' and then all these dead fish appeared floating on the surface which the fishermen hauled in with nets			2
' i was absolutely disgusted and shocked beyond belief			0
' a spokesman for the @entity92 said : ' these fishermen make most of their money from taking tourists out to watch them at work			1
' we are attempting to crack down on it though			0

blast fishing outlawed in many countries because it damages *environment*
but fishermen in @entity16 , south - east @entity2 , are *keeping* it alive
they are said to make more cash from showing tourists than catching fish
