by @entity0 for @entity1 people who use @entity3 and @entity4 are less likely than others to share their opinions on hot - button issues , even when they are offline			1
that 's according to a survey that challenges the view of social media as a vehicle for debate			1
the study suggests that sites like @entity3 and @entity4 might actually encourage self - censorship			1
online loudmouths may be annoying , but a new survey suggests they are in the minority			0
in a report released tuesday , the @entity20 found that most people who regularly use social media sites were actually less likely to share their opinions , even offline ( stock image shown ) the study was carried out by @entity20 in @entity27 in conjunction with @entity29 in @entity30			1
@entity3 is on a quest to ' weed out ' links to ‘ click - baiting ’ stories that are designed to make people click on them			0
the social network says that by monitoring how long people spend reading news articles , as well as how they interact with them , it can prioritise the best content that pops up in people 's @entity41			1
in a blog post , research scientist @entity43 , and @entity44 , a product specialist at @entity3 , said the firm has made improvements ‘ to help people find the posts and links from publishers that are most interesting and relevant , and to continue to weed out stories that people frequently tell us are spammy and that they do n’t want to see			0
@entity3 said a survey revealed that 80 per cent of its users prefer headlines what make the content of an article crystal clear , so they can work out if a link is worth clicking on			0
researchers said they detected what they call the ' spiral of silence ' phenomenon : unless people know their audience agrees , they are likely to shy away from discussing anything controversial			1
in other words , most people are more comfortable with ice - bucket challenges than political banter			0
' people do not tend to be using social media for this type of important political discussion , ' said @entity77 , a communications professor at @entity29 who helped conduct the study			1
' and if anything , it may actually be removing conversation from the public sphere			0
' the survey was conducted shortly after @entity84 acknowledged leaking classified intelligence that exposed widespread government surveillance of @entity89 ' phone and email records			0
@entity77 said the @entity84 case provided researchers with a concrete example of a major national issue that divided @entity89 and dominated news coverage			0
of the 1,801 adults surveyed , 86 per cent said they would be willing to discuss their views about government surveillance if it came up at various in - person scenarios , such as at a public meeting , at work or at a restaurant with friends			0
but just 42 per cent of @entity3 or @entity4 users said they would be willing to post online about it			2
in addition , the typical @entity3 user - defined as someone who logs onto the site a few times per day - was actually half as likely to discuss the @entity84 case at a public meeting as a non-facebook user			2
meanwhile , someone who goes on @entity4 a few times per day was one - quarter as likely to share opinions in the workplace compared with those who never use @entity4			2
only when a person felt that their @entity3 network agreed with their opinion were they twice as likely to join a site discussion on the issue , the survey found			0
researchers in @entity27 and @entity30 say @entity3 ( stock image shown ) and @entity4 are stifling people 's opinions			1
in the study they found typical users were afraid to voice their opinions offline			1
they call this the ' spiral of silence ' phenomenon where people shy away from discussing controversial topics another finding was that social media did n't make it easier for people to share opinions they would n't otherwise share			1
of the 14 per cent of @entity89 unwilling to discuss the @entity84 case with others in person , fewer than one - half of 1 per cent were willing to discuss it on social media			2
@entity151 , director of the @entity152 , said one explanation is it 's possible that social media actually makes people sensitive to different opinions			1
' because they use social media , they may know more about the depth of disagreement over the issue in their wide circle of contacts , ' he said			2
' this might make them hesitant to speak up either online or offline for fear of starting an argument , offending or even losing a friend			0
' @entity77 added that there is a concern that a person 's fear of offending someone on social media stifles debate			2
' a society where people are n't able to share their opinions openly and gain from understanding alternative perspectives is a polarised society , ' he said .			0

researchers at the @entity20 in @entity27 and @entity30 say @entity3 and @entity4 are stifling people 's opinions
in a study they found typical users were afraid to voice their opinions offline
they call this the ' spiral of silence ' phenomenon where people shy away from discussing controversial topics unless they know their audience agrees
in one finding people who regularly use @entity4 were one quarter as likely to discuss opinions in the workplace to those who never use @entity4
one alternate theory is that social media makes people more *empathetic* to the opinions of others
