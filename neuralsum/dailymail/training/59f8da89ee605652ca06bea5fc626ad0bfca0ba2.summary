@entity0 celebrates two years in charge of a @entity3 side dented but not broken by their winless start to life back in the @entity7			1
the @entity3 boss , who took over on october 30 , 2012 with the side 13th in the @entity10 , needs no reminding that @entity3 are the only club in the top four tiers of @entity14 football without a victory			1
breaking that sequence does not get any easier , with a trip to the @entity18 to face @entity19 to come on saturday			1
@entity0 's said his side are using criticism as a motivation , @entity3 are yet to win in the league this season @entity3 are already being talked about in the context of worst ever @entity7 seasons			1
no team has ever failed to win a game during a campaign , although @entity29 only managed one in 2007 - 08 , while @entity31 went 16 games without a victory at the start of the 2012 - 13 season			1
not that @entity0 is concerned by what has gone before , and he is not shying away from the reality of the situation			2
' whether it hurts or not is irrelevant , ' he said			0
' the fact is it 's a fact			2
what it does is gives you the added motivation to get wins			0
' the only thing i ever guaranteed when i came here was that i 'd have a group of motivated people giving everything they can , and that 's exactly what we 've still got			0
@entity3 have endured a torrid start to the season , and lost 3 - 1 to @entity57 in their last outing ' now we 've got to give even more , because that 's what you 've got to do to win matches in the @entity7			1
' i 'm used to winning and this group 's used to winning , so that 's been something we have to get our head around and allow the players the freedom to play to move forward			0
' i 've been down this road before			0
i 've had a spell here when we did n't win games , i 've been at @entity72 when we did n't win games			0
' it 's very rare that managers have it comfortable for year after year			0
even @entity77 was questioned after the first game last season			0
' i 'm learning plenty from it , that 's for sure			0
it affects me in that my instinct is to win , and it has been since i was a little kid			0
that 's the bit that dents you , but it does n't break you			0
@entity3 will face @entity19 at the @entity18 on saturday , @entity87 could make his return from injury ' it 's not about proving anyone wrong , it 's about proving ourselves right			1
' just as @entity0 does not subscribe to the doom - laden predictions for his club , he also does not read anything into those criticising @entity19 's start to the season			1
the @entity102 have won only once at home in the league , on the opening day against @entity106 , and needed a late goal to draw with @entity108 two weeks ago			1
' we really look at ourselves , ' said @entity0 , whose side held @entity111 to a draw at @entity113 in august			1
' it 's another fantastic challenge , particularly away from home			2
@entity19 have changed massively over the years to what they are now from when i was playing , they 're a completely different animal and recognised in a worldwide market			2
' we 've had some huge clubs already , mainly at home , and this is one of the super powers away from home			2

@entity3 travel to the @entity18 to face @entity19 on saturday
@entity0 's side currently bottom of @entity7
@entity0 says criticism of the team is motivating them
the @entity3 boss described @entity19 as a ' super power '
