by @entity0 after months of tireless fundraising a five - year - old has undergone surgery that will change her life			1
@entity4 has cerebral palsy which meant she was unable to walk without a frame			1
however , she has now had pioneering surgery to enable her to walk normally at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 @entity4 , five , was born 10 weeks early and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was nine months old			1
as a result , she was unable to walk without a frame the surgery , called @entity14 ( @entity16 ) surgery , was only available in the @entity10 until recently			1
it is now being performed at a few hospitals in the @entity19 but according to @entity21 guidelines @entity23 's hips are too far out of position for surgeons to operate in this country			0
speaking from @entity10 , @entity23 ’s father , @entity27 , said the surgery had gone ‘ well ’			1
@entity23 and her family left the @entity19 on friday and she underwent the surgery on tuesday			1
mr @entity31 , 41 , of @entity32 , said : ‘ the operation went well and there were no problems			2
@entity23 had some back spasms last night which was difficult to see			0
‘ the next few days will be hard for her as it is bed rest			0
’ @entity23 's family raised £ 42,000 for her to fly to the @entity10 for pioneering surgery to allow her to walk normally			1
she is pictured in hospital before the operation which took place on tuesday it is hoped that the @entity14 surgery will allow @entity23 to walk independently after physiotherapy @entity23 , who was born 10 weeks early , has n't been able to walk or stand unaided since being diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at nine months old			1
however , her friends and family helped raise £ 42,000 to allow her to have the @entity16 surgery			2
the operation is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
it involves opening the lower vertebrae to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
@entity23 ( pictured with her father , @entity27 ) is said to be doing well after the operation the surgery is available in the @entity19 but @entity23 's hips were considered to be too far out of position to make the operation possible in this country during the procedure , electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			1
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
mr @entity31 said : ‘ when we met the doctor he assessed @entity23 and told us she would be an independent walker and will probably take her first steps within a year			0
‘ @entity88 crossed that with hard work it will become the greatest day of our lives			0
’ mr @entity31 and @entity23 expected to return to the @entity19 on february 23 and @entity23 will start work with her physiotherapist at the @entity94 in @entity95			0
she will require months , if not years , of physiotherapy to allow her to get the most out of the surgery			1
@entity14 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			2
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs .			1

@entity4 was born 10 weeks *prematurely* and was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of nine months
she was unable to walk without the aid of a walking frame
to enable her to walk without the frame she needed surgery , called @entity14 surgery , which required her to go to the @entity10
she had the operation on tuesday and her parents are now hoping she will be able to walk unaided after physiotherapy
