by @entity0 published : 04:24 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 04:30 est , 7 october 2013 the roles played by imprisoned @entity3 's long - time secretary and subordinate staff during his decades - long fraudulent deals and alleged office affairs will soon be revealed in court			1
the trial of the @entity10 king 's associates - including one of the government 's prize witnesses , @entity11 , @entity3 's former finance chief - is expected to last up to five months and begins tomorrow in federal court in @entity15 , @entity16			1
the government will for the first time show a jury what it has collected in its five - year probe of one of history 's biggest frauds , which saw @entity3 jailed for 150 years for duping thousands of investors out of nearly $ 20billion since the 1970s			1
office affairs : details of alleged sexual relationships in @entity3 's office are expected to be revealed during the decades - long @entity10 fraud that saw him jailed for 150 years details yet to be revealed are of alleged sexual and romantic activities that seemed to permeate @entity3 's offices when he was perceived as a high flying @entity35 guru - so smart that he could ensure double - digit returns to his investors even when the economy was flat or in decline			1
pretrial maneuvers included an effort by prosecutors to exclude from evidence any mention of such affairs , but as yet , no decision has been made to block these details			0
prosecutors said in court papers : ' suffice it to say that the government 's investigation has revealed that , over the course of the multi-decade fraud alleged in the indictment , a number of @entity55 employees and customers - including expected witnesses , defendants , and others - were engaged in romantic or sexual relationships			1
' the government said @entity3 himself was engaged in a love triangle with one of the defendants			2
there are only two female defendants appearing in the trial - staffer @entity71 and @entity3 's longtime secretary @entity72			1
one of the two : court documents claim that one of the female defendants - either staffer @entity71 ( left ) or his longtime secretary @entity72 ( right ) - were involved in the love triangle the lawyer for the four employees ( including ms @entity72 , pictured ) tried to get ' inflammatory ' evidence barred from the courtroom @entity83 district judge @entity82 , a calm , thoughtful presence on the bench , has not yet said for sure whether the salacious allegations can be aired in the courtroom			1
the government is counting on @entity90 to explain to jurors the roles played by each defendant			0
prosecutors say fictitious trades and phantom accounts were created with help from @entity3 's secretary , @entity72 , a supervisor in his private investment business ; @entity100 , his director of operations for investments ; @entity102 , an account manager ; and computer programmers @entity104 and @entity106			1
all have pleaded not guilty			0
six others have pleaded guilty in the case , including @entity11			0
amid a collapsing economy , @entity3 was forced to reveal his fraud in december 2008 , acknowledging that accounts he had told investors were worth nearly $ 68 billion only days earlier actually held only a few hundred million dollars			2
trial begins : the trial against the former @entity3 staffers , including @entity100 ( left ) and @entity106 ( right ) , will begin tomorrow and is expected to last five months he had lied to thousands of investors , including retirees , charities , school trusts and even @entity122 survivors			1
he pleaded guilty to fraud charges a few months later and was sentenced to a 150 - year prison term in @entity125 , @entity126 of the money has since been recovered by a court - appointed trustee			0
@entity3 , 75 , claimed during his guilty plea that he acted alone , but the government says that was not true and will use the trial to try to prove it			0
details of the lavish lifestyles of @entity3 's associates will not be revealed , however , as judge @entity82 has excluded much of this evidence , such as @entity3 allegedly splashing them with tens of millions of dollars even as the @entity140 grew closer to its abrupt culmination			1
from his cell : @entity3 is currently serving a 150 - year sentence in @entity145 's @entity144 ( pictured ) jurors wo n't hear about @entity148 's @entity147 or her vacation home or her shopping forays to pricey department stores			2
as her lawyers wrote in persuading the judge to exclude personal expenses : ' the government seeks to tap into the public 's generalized anger at ` @entity159 , ' which has the potential to result in an unjust verdict ` fabricated ' from the jury 's emotional response to proof that is not tethered to any element of the charges against ms. @entity72			0
' @entity71 's lawyers made a similar argument , saying ' whether she purchased a beach house or not , went on vacation or not , bought a deluxe refrigerator or not , proves nothing about what happened ... or what ms. @entity71 knew			0
' assets : after his downfall @entity3 had to sell several homes , including his @entity15 penthouse for sale : the convicted fraudster had to give up his beach house in @entity182 , @entity183 still , the judge is allowing into evidence information about the beach house and a @entity188 vacation for another defendant because @entity3 's firm directly helped fund them			2
and the first trial may not be the last			0
just days ago , prosecutors charged a 77 - year - old accounting executive , saying he directed others since at least the early 1990s to falsify records and help conceal @entity3 's fraud			2
he , too , has pleaded not guilty			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
