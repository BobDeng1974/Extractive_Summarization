by @entity0 last updated at 8:55 am on 25th january 2012 @entity2 's ramshackle government lost control of a former @entity5 stronghold today after locals staged an armed uprising			1
forces loyal to ousted , and now dead , leader @entity5 seized control of @entity10 and then raised in celebration the deposed regime 's green flag on hundreds of buildings			1
the re-taking of the town , which saw elders driven out in a lengthy bloody gunbattle which killed four people and left 25 others wounded , raises the spectre that the country will descend into civil war			1
celebration : a photo , reportedly from @entity10 which appeared on a @entity2 website , shows a green flag being raised as @entity28 re-captured the town dumped : a damaged tank lies abandoned in a street following the gunbattle which left four people dead and 25 others wounded the return of violence to the oil - rich @entity36 nation will also be met with a rolling of the eyes in @entity40 and @entity41 , who both spent billions in pushing @entity5 out			1
this week 's bloodshed in @entity10 poses the gravest challenge yet to the country 's new rulers - the @entity48			1
a local resident said yesterday 's battles began when members of the may 28 militia , affiliated to the @entity48 , arrested some former @entity5 loyalists			1
that prompted other supporters of the former leader to attack the militia 's garrison			2
@entity59 , the head of @entity10 local council , fled to the nearby city of @entity63 following the attack , which witnesses said was fought using heavy weaponry			1
aftermath : the barracks of the may 28 brigade - fighters loyal to the @entity70 - was left riddled with bullet holes after the firefight captured : photos , reportedly taken in @entity10 , show the flags that represent the presence of supporters of the ousted regime a top commander of a revolutionary brigade in @entity10 , @entity80 , who was present in @entity82 during the attack , said he had lost contact with other fighters in the town			1
the @entity48 still has the backing of the @entity89 powers who , with their diplomatic pressure and bombing campaign , helped push out @entity5 and install the new government			1
@entity48 authorities pledged to unify the tribally - divided country , reconstruct its once mighty oil industry that made @entity2 a major exporter in @entity98 , and hold democratic elections			2
but the town 's revolt heightens doubts in the @entity103 about the @entity48 government 's ability to instil law and order			2
this is seen as crucial to rebuilding oil exports , to disarming tribal militias and guarding @entity2 borders in a region where @entity113 is active			2
anger : @entity2 damage the car of @entity48 chairman @entity116 over the weekend demands : among protesters in @entity82 are @entity119 demanding @entity2 's rulers apply sharia law the collapse of @entity48 authority in the town , one of the most die - hard bastions of @entity128 sentiment during @entity2 's nine - month civil war last year , could not come at a worse time			2
growing discontent about the @entity48 has spread across the country - with the biggest demonstration taking place in @entity82 , the birthplace of last year 's uprising			2
@entity136 , vice-president of the @entity48 , resigned on monday after a series of violent protests in the eastern port city			1
demonstrators , who claim many @entity48 members are tarnished by ties to @entity5 and failed to quickly restore basic public services , smashed windows at the local headquarters on saturday night			1
and on thursday , crowds jostled @entity147 during a library visit as security staff struggled to help him escape			2
last night he said he was quitting to try to limit the damage to the council			0
discontent : crowds break into the local @entity48 headquarters in @entity82 on saturday occupation : crowds demanded to speak @entity48 leader @entity116 after reaching the second floor ‘ my resignation is for the benefit of the nation and is required at this stage , ’ @entity136 told @entity160			0
he said the national consensus that helped the country rise up and end @entity5 ’s rule had not lasted into peacetime , giving way instead to what he called an atmosphere of ‘ hatred			1
’ ‘ i do not want this atmosphere to continue and negatively affect the @entity48 and its performance , ’ said @entity136 , who also acted as the @entity48 ’s spokesman			0
he is one of the most senior of @entity2 ’s new rulers to have left office since @entity5 ’s overthrow in august			1
his departure will revive doubts about the @entity48 ’s ability to form a cohesive and effective government			0
@entity48 chief @entity116 , speaking in @entity82 on monday , appealed to the protesters to be more patient			0
confusion : @entity48 deputy @entity136 , left , quit despite leader @entity116 saying he did n't think his colleague would resign			0
@entity116 warned the country was descending into a ' bottomless pit ' ‘ we are going through a political movement that can take the country to a bottomless pit , ’ he said			0
‘ there is something behind these protests that is not for the good of the country			0
‘ the people have not given the government enough time and the government does not have enough money			0
‘ maybe there are delays , but the government has only been working for two months			0
give them a chance , at least two months			0
’ in a glimpse of the lack of co-ordination which @entity210 diplomats say pervades the workings of the @entity48 , @entity116 was asked if @entity136 would be stepping down and said he would not			0
the organisation is also under increasing pressure to hand over @entity5 ’s influential son @entity214 to the @entity215 in the @entity216			1
disturbing legacy : many @entity48 members are said to be tainted by former dictator @entity5 , while his son @entity214 , right , is the now the focus of international human rights groups over the way he is being held despite his father ’s regime ’s brutal record , the case has become an unlikely rallying point for global human rights advocates			1
the @entity48 have been criticised for failing to tell him what he is charged with or give him access to a lawyer			0
@entity214 , who lost his right thumb and forefinger during the civil war , is also denied visitors , television , radio and the internet at his compound in @entity241 , 100 miles from @entity242			0
@entity2 leaders insist the country will hold a trial			0
but @entity246 , an @entity247 official , said the @entity48 had failed to put in place a trial system with independent judges and skilled prosecutors .			0

@entity10 now under control of @entity5 loyalists
