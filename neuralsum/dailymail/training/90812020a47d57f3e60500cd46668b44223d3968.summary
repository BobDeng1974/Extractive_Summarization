by @entity0 @entity1 may have given her blessing , but that has n't stopped eyebrows being raised about ex @entity6 's rumoured new partner - hunger games star , @entity7			1
the two have reportedly been ' secretly ' dating since july			0
which means 41 - year - old @entity1 must surely be threatened , right ? ( really guys ? have you seen those legs ? ) there 's something very grounded about @entity7 that seems to gel with @entity6 and with a 13 - year age gap - @entity15 's 24 , @entity6 is 37 - can this really work long - term ? the naysayer 's say no. with more than a decade between them , what points of reference do @entity6 and @entity15 have ? they 've grown up with different music , tv , movies , what do they talk about ? @entity6 has two children already , wo n't @entity15 want to have hers with someone who 'll experience it with her for the very first time ? what about the power dynamic ? @entity15 's the younger partner and in the ' pupil ' position			1
@entity6 has lived longer so probably ( hopefully ) knows more			2
@entity0 says acceptance levels of age - gap relationships has never been higher the power 's automatically on his side : wo n't @entity15 view him as a teacher or parent , someone to hide things from if she 's been ' naughty ' ? as the older partner , wo n't @entity15 's lack of experience and wisdom be frustrating for @entity6 ? he 's been through all the experiences she 's about to and who really wants to go back for round two ? do age - gap relationships ever really work long - term ? well , actually , yes they can - and do ! being around the same age is a rough predictor of having common ground but it does n't guarantee synchron Â­ isation			1
we are all a sum of totals			0
our true maturity depends very much on what we 've accomplished , our personality , genetics , life experiences , expectations and morals			0
there might be 13 years between @entity6 and @entity15 but , to my eye , they appear to have a lot more in common than @entity6 and @entity1 ever did			2
@entity15 might glam up for the red carpet , but off duty she 's parked firmly in the no - makeup and scruffy jeans camp			0
one reason @entity1 and @entity6 did n't work out was she loved getting glammed for the @entity78 premieres and being seen in all the right places			1
@entity1 is fanatical about health and diet , @entity6 decided he was n't vegetarian quick - smart post break - up			1
which is rather handy since @entity15 's fond of fast food and burgers			0
both women are bright and undeniably elegant ( who did n't fall for @entity15 when she so oh - so - gracefully tripped on her way to receive an @entity90 )			0
but there 's something very grounded about @entity7 that seems to gel with @entity6 ' consistent shying away from the limelight			1
in the face of all that common ground , does it really matter he 's been on the planet for 13 more years ? we constantly focus on ways society is failing us but acceptance levels of age - gap relationships has never been higher			1
this not only shows maturity of attitude , it 's practical too ! @entity106 knows , it 's hard enough finding a soulmate without having to make sure you 're both matching bookends			0
i like this new pairing and that @entity6 and @entity15 have n't let age get in the way			2
may i suggest they relax and enjoy - and if need be , get a few tips from @entity116 and @entity117 ( 22 years difference , together 12 years ) and @entity119 and @entity120 ( 25 years difference , together 24 years ) along the way			0
