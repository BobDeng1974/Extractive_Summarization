the recent miseries of @entity1 reached a new low on wednesday after the club were suspended by the @entity4 and ordered to stop ‘ all football activity ’			1
their latest crisis strikes with depressing timing , coming just two days after the draw for the third round of the @entity11 — the competition in which @entity1 achieved the most famous @entity11 upset of all against @entity15 in 1972			1
the game ’s authorities acted after one of the financially stricken club ’s shareholders , @entity21 , was charged with acting as an officer for @entity1 without written confirmation from the @entity4 to do so			1
in my long experience and years in football i can not recall such an occasion			0
since i joined the club in 1971 and before then , @entity1 were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart			1
it was always one of the best - run clubs in non-league football			0
they attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great @entity52			0
but for one reason or another it ’s gone away from that in the last few years			0
i ’m a member of the @entity57 ’ @entity58 and i try to keep on top of what is going on — it ’s not been nice to follow			0
i was with @entity26 just a couple of weeks ago filming something for the @entity63 about the @entity11 — it ’s a shame to go from that to this			0
we are all scattered far and wide from that side but the club remains a big part of us			2
what has happened has shocked me but i ca n’t say it has surprised me			0
what i hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the @entity57 ’ trust			2
it can work when you do it that way			0
i certainly ca n’t see a shining knight coming in			0
@entity81 scored the famous second goal in the 2 - 1 win when @entity84 knocked out @entity15 in the @entity11 third round in 1972			1
@entity1 ’s new majority shareholder , @entity87 , is understood to be confident that the situation will be resolved today and the sanction removed immediately			1
but the saga represents a humiliating low for the club , which is believed to owe £ 1.5million and is due at the @entity93 in @entity94 on monday to contest a winding - up petition			2
the local council also confirmed it is ‘ thoroughly re-examining ’ the terms of the lease of the @entity102 ground as the club fights to save its future			1
@entity103 , vice-chairman of the @entity104 , told @entity105 : ‘ the winding - up petition is the real worry			0
‘ this suspension is not what anyone wanted but the @entity4 should have done something here a long time ago			1
‘ it should not have come to the situation that the club are in			2
’ cash - strapped @entity1 were expelled from the @entity115 in june for failing to pay creditors the club have been based at their @entity102 home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future the court date will come only six months after @entity1 were expelled from the conference over their failure to clear debt and deposit a £ 350,000 bond			1
they have since found themselves in the @entity127 — the seventh tier of @entity130 football — and a supporter protest against the running of the club has seen their average gate fall from 1,758 last season to little more than 400			2
@entity87 , who took over the club on wednesday having previously been chairman , has promised significant investment to keep them afloat			0
but supporters are hugely sceptical and critical of a man who had 21 appointments at 17 dissolved companies and was disqualified from being a company director from october 2006 for six years			0
despite the growing uncertainty over the 90 - year - old club ’s future , @entity1 assistant manager @entity145 insisted on wednesday that @entity1 are continuing to prepare for their fixture at @entity151 on saturday			1
he said : ‘ we ’re still training full - time and still expecting a game saturday			0
’ in revealing their decision to suspend @entity1 , an @entity4 statement read : ‘ having failed to comply with the orders of the independent regulatory commission , both @entity1 and @entity21 are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect			1
‘ the @entity4 understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to @entity1 at the earliest opportunity , although this will be contingent on the club complying with the regulations and subsequent orders of the independent regulatory commission			1
’ @entity1 sit 15th in the @entity172 and were due to play @entity151 on saturday			2

@entity1 's future is uncertain after latest @entity4 punishment
club were expelled from the @entity115 in june over missed payments
now they have fallen foul of the owners ' and directors ' test
@entity1 shot to fame with giantkilling of @entity15 in 1972
