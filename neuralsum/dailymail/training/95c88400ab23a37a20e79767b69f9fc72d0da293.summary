@entity0 says his father 's release from prison next month will further inspire him to win the world title this year			1
' @entity5 , himself a former professional heavyweight , has been inside since being given an 11 - year sentence back in february 2011 after gauging a man 's eye out in a brawl			2
@entity0 had been young @entity0 's trainer but he has not watched his son fight live for almost five years â€“ when he beat @entity14 for the vacant @entity16 title in 2010 @entity0 ( right ) takes on @entity17 at the @entity18 in @entity19 next month @entity0 will be a short favourite against @entity17 who has lost three of his 20 fights the 26 - year - old has come a long way since that night , now under the tutelage of @entity14 's brother and highly respected trainer @entity28 , and has worked his way into the mandatory position for @entity33 's @entity32 title			1
@entity0 's next test comes against @entity17 on february 28 at @entity19 's @entity35 , after which he will pursue that shot at @entity33 or even a showdown with @entity39 knock - out artist @entity38 , who is now the @entity41 belt holder			1
it is unclear whether @entity43 , who has spent time at his son 's gym while on day release , will be allowed to attend the @entity17 clash due to the terms of his release , but he will be able to watch the fight as a free man for the first time since 2010			1
@entity0 said : ' my father gets out on february 11			1
' i 'm not too sure if he will be allowed to come to the @entity17 fight			1
i do n't know the rules and regulations of his release will be but it is something i 'm not focusing on			0
fury is fighting for the first time since his emphatic win over @entity64 last november @entity0 dominated @entity64 for 10 rounds of their rematch before the @entity68 retired on his stool ' he is out in three weeks now so he will be coming down to the gym and helping out - doing whatever the governing bodies say - that 's what he will have to do			1
' it has been good having him around in the gym and stuff - it 's my dad is n't it ? we have a close relationship so it 's always good and inspiring to have him about			2
' february 28 will be @entity0 's first outing since he outclassed @entity64 at the @entity82 with a fine boxing display , much of which was spent in the southpaw stance before his opponent was retired at the end of the 10th round			1
that bout came on november 29 and allowed him to spend some time out over @entity90 before focusing on a huge 2015			0
but he has now returned to the ' brutal ' schedule arranged by uncle @entity28 at their gym in @entity94 , which they live above during camp			0
the 26 - year - old said : ' i had about five weeks off over @entity90 and @entity99 and indulged in a lot of nice foods			2
i took advantage of what i had just done in the @entity64 fight and appreciated being around my family and kids			0
@entity0 is the mandatory challenger to world champion @entity33 and hopes to fight him this year ' you do n't realise what you miss when you 're away until you spend a lot of time with them			1
i 'm now back in training camp and that was hard in the beginning because i was used to waking up and being with the kids and taking them to school			0
' being back in strict training camp with three sessions a day is a hard regime but work has got to be done and bills have got to be paid			0
' i 'm back in @entity94 , living above the gym , five days a week up there and home for the weekend and then back to @entity94 on sunday night			0
it 's a good scheduled routine for me			2
' @entity0 added : ' in the past i 've made very bold predictions but i 'm starting to become very correct in what i say			2
so i am not going to predict something unless i truly believe it is going to happen			0
' i believe it 's my destiny from being born to become heavyweight champion of the world			1
after having one amateur fight i thought so			0
i do n't aim low when i aim to achieve , it 's all or nothing			0

@entity0 takes on @entity17 in @entity19 next month
@entity0 's dad will have been released from prison two weeks beforehand
