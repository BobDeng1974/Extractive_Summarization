one in seven patients can no longer be helped by antibiotics because they are increasingly ineffective after being handed out too freely by @entity3 , it emerged last night			2
experts warn that the deepening problem could be fatal for a significant number of @entity7 with common but potentially life - threatening infections			1
for some infections , the failure rate was one in three			2
overall , it has increased by 12 per cent in 22 years as the number of prescriptions has steadily increased			0
antibiotic - resistant bacteria , such as this strain of @entity16 are becoming more common ( file picture ) for infections such as pneumonia , which commonly affects the elderly , the consequences are fatal			1
dame @entity22 , the chief medical officer , has already warned the problem is so severe that routine hip operations , caesarean sections and even minor scratches could become deadly			1
it has been declared a public health crisis by the @entity29			1
the issue has been caused by @entity3 prescribing antibiotics too readily , sometimes for viruses such as coughs and colds for which they are ineffective			2
vets have also been using the medication too widely on animals			0
as a result , the bacteria that make humans ill have evolved to become resistant to treatments that used to kill them			1
drug firms have also not produced more effective antibiotics because they are not deemed profitable			2
researchers from the @entity46 looked at the records of almost 11 million patients prescribed antibiotics between 1991 and 2012 for sinusitis , sore throats , skin infections , bronchitis and pneumonia			1
for 15.4 per cent of patients given an antibiotic in 2012 , it did not work			0
the failure rate was only 13.9 per cent in 1991			0
doctors sometimes give out antibiotics as a catch - all when they are unsure whether an ill person is suffering from a virus , which can not be treated with the drugs , or a bacterial infection ( file picture ) in cases of bronchitis and pneumonia – which can be deadly – this rate can be as high as 35 per cent , or one in three			1
professor @entity71 , of @entity46 ’s @entity72 , said : ‘ the growing ineffectiveness of antibiotics is very worrying			0
we need to minimise unnecessary or inappropriate treatment which could be fuelling microbial resistance to antibiotics , prolonging illness and in some cases killing people			1
‘ people are given antibiotics inappropriately			1
we ca n’t always test whether it ’s due to a virus or bug , so antibiotics are a fallback			0
’ @entity89 said : ‘ the research shows the urgent need to develop new antibiotics , something this government is looking to address through a review on anti-microbial resistance commissioned by the prime minister			1
’ the study also found that the number of patients given antibiotics had risen from 60 per cent in 1991 to 65 per cent in 2012			0
gps can not test whether a sore throat or a rash is caused by bacteria or a virus , which can not be treated by antibiotics			1
but when put under pressure by patients they may prescribe them in the hope they will work			0
there are thought to be 25,000 deaths a year in @entity114 from infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics			1
dr @entity117 , associate professor in cellular microbiology at the @entity119 , said : ‘ antibiotic resistance is one of the major global health concerns we face			0
‘ while it is not surprising that the amount of resistant infections has increased , the sheer numbers are of great concern			1
’ not enough children are receiving vital vaccinations that protect against serious infections and illnesses			0
in the past year in @entity133 , 94.3 per cent of children who turned one were given the so - called five - in - one jabs to protect against diphtheria , tetanus , whooping cough , polio and haemophilus @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , according to the @entity141 ( @entity141 )			0
this falls below the 95 per cent recommended by the @entity29			2
the @entity141 ’s latest statistics on immunisation also show that just 92.7 per cent of children reaching their second birthday had received the @entity147 jab , which protects against measles , mumps and rubella			0
even though this coverage is at its highest since the vaccine was introduced in 1988 , @entity133 still remains below the @entity29 minimum of 95 per cent			2
@entity141 said coverage in @entity133 was below that of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 for all routine childhood vaccines at the ages of one , two and five			0
across the country , it was lowest in @entity163 .			0

some bacteria that makes people ill has become resistant to antibiotics
experts warn the deepening problem could lead to @entity7 *fatalities*
antibiotics fail one in three times for some infections , research finds
hip ops , caesarean sections and even minor scratches could become deadly
the @entity29 has declared a public health crisis
