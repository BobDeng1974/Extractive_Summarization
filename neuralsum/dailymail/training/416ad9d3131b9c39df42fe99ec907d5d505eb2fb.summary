a flight from @entity1 to @entity2 descended into chaos when an agitated passenger attempted to jump out of the emergency exit			1
the @entity7 flight from @entity8 to @entity9 had been airborne for around two hours when passengers reported hearing panicked screaming			1
new zealander @entity12 claims he and a group of fellow fliers were forced to physically restrain the man , who had begun to kick the emergency exit , attempting to jump out of the plane			1
the man , who had become agitated , was claiming he had been kidnapped and drugged , and that there were people in @entity2 waiting to kill him			2
mr @entity12 told @entity42 broadcaster @entity40 : ' i was having quite a good sleep and i just heard screaming , really loud panicked screaming			1
' i sat bolt upright and looked down towards the first bulkhead where the first exit row is and there was a guy at the exit door trying to kick it open			0
it 's impossible to open the emergency exit door during flight due to the difference in air pressure inside and outside the aircraft ' a cable tie was handed to me and i could n't get it around his hands because he was fighting too much , so that 's why i decided to stun him or knock him out , which did n't work			2
' but eventually i did stun him enough to stop him struggling			0
it was very scary , i was really shaken			0
it 's fight or flight is n't it , and i tend to flight			0
' mr @entity12 , who was flying home to his six - year - old son , said he and the other passengers tied the man to some seats , and tried to find out if was travelling with anyone			1
he believed the passenger was in some sort of drug - induced state			0
passengers did not know that it is impossible to open the emergency exit door in flight due to the high altitude			2
as the plane climbs , the pressure outside the cabin decreases relative to that inside the cabin , and this difference in pressure keeps the door sealed			0
the @entity93 confirmed they were alerted after a 27 - year - old man from the @entity2 was restrained by airline staff and passengers after he allegedly tried to open an exit door on a flight from @entity1 to @entity2			1
the man had an initial medical assessment at @entity101 and was then issued a notice to appear in court for the offence of endangering the safety of an aircraft			1
he is due to appear at @entity107 on december 16 , according to an @entity93 spokesman			0
@entity7 are now taking statements from staff on board the plane .			0
