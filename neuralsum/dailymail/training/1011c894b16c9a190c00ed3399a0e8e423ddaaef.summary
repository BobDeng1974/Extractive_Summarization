the vibrant sounds and smells of @entity2 had been calling me back since i first visited the @entity5 area in 2011 - the year after i won @entity7 gold in the skeleton at the @entity9			1
i was in @entity2 filming a survival reality tv show and after it was over i stayed in touch with @entity13 , one of the guides who had helped train us for the show			1
he kept telling me amazing stories of the incredible areas of @entity2 that i should come back and visit one day			1
i could n't resist , and three years later he ended up putting together a personalised safari for me and my fiance , @entity22			1
@entity23 and her fiance @entity22 take time for a happy snap while on safari in @entity2 @entity28 has been guiding safaris in @entity2 and throughout @entity30 for over 10 years			1
he and his partner @entity31 and they specialise in getting to the core of why people go on safari and what they want to experience			1
@entity28 called me one evening and said : ' @entity37 , i 'm taking you on a journey , not a holiday			1
' at @entity42 in northern @entity2 - the ' gateway to the @entity5 ' - @entity28 and @entity41 loaded us up in their open - sided game - viewing vehicle , i switched off my phone and let the journey begin			1
our first destination was @entity50 , in the @entity51			2
this quirky , intimate camp run by @entity53 and his son @entity54 sits on top of a 90ft - high cliff , looking down on to the @entity57 at exactly the point where animals come to drink			2
we were greeted by five bull elephants drinking in the river , with a couple of zebras roaming around close by , and a hippo seeming to watch over all of them from the middle of the river			2
@entity23 ( left ) always wanted to return to @entity2 after filming survival tv show @entity69 in 2011 with a gin and tonic in our hands , we watched a beautiful sunset with the wildlife below			1
i never realised how alive the bush of @entity2 could really be			1
@entity77 bush camp in the @entity51 , which sits on the top of a 90 foot clifftop and looks down on wild animals of the region as they gather for water as we awoke the next morning to the sounds of birdlife surrounding us , hot water arrived for our brass bucket showers			2
these showers are perfectly positioned overlooking the river , giving the most incredible experience of showering while an elephant wanders by 150ft away on the other side of the river			2
after a hearty breakfast we were off			2
@entity28 took us out to the @entity95 , the last remnant of an ancient lake			1
we arrived at the most incredible setting			2
as far as the eye could see was endless salt pan			2
that night , we slept out under the stars , with a view of the milky way all the way to the horizon			2
in the morning , on our way back to @entity77 , i was excited to hear @entity28 say he could see some meerkats coming out of their burrow			1
meerkats take lots of time to warm up in the early sunshine			2
we spent quite some time watching them slowly emerge to start their day of foraging			2
before leaving @entity77 , @entity28 took us on a walk with the @entity116			1
the bush is their home , and they gave us a really interesting insight into it			2
they showed us how they set traps for food , how they make fire , and some of the interesting ways they entertain themselves			0
they have what i can only describe as a fast - paced version of rock , paper , scissors			0
we continued our journey to @entity28 's favourite area within @entity2 , @entity139 in the north - eastern @entity5			1
a vehicle cuts a lonely figure on the @entity95 , the last remnant of an ancient lake i vividly remembered @entity28 mentioning this area three years previously for being a wildlife paradise - and our drive there showed me he was not wrong			1
what will always stick in my mind is the magical sight of 12 giraffe silhouettes in the road with the sun setting behind them			0
we were staying at @entity155 run by @entity156 , a veteran of the @entity2 safari industry			1
it looks like something from the style pages of a glossy magazine , with all the homely warmth of a country manor , and set in the most beautiful surroundings on the @entity165			0
@entity166 is also incredibly eco-friendly			0
it recycles everything and has a practically non-existent footprint , while remaining very luxurious - a perfect balance for me			0
@entity23 took a walk with the @entity116 , who offer a remarkable insight into living off the land @entity176 is situated among the trees at the edge of @entity165			1
there is nothing more peaceful and relaxing than having meals while watching elephants drinking , and nothing more thrilling than watching a male and female leopard wandering along the river bank on the other side			0
just incredible ! the wildlife that @entity28 had raved about in @entity139 did not disappoint			1
during our three nights there we saw a big male lion hunting a large warthog , a beautiful female leopard waking after a day 's sleep , three honey badgers , a pack of wild dogs on the hunt , and a hyena den with five cute youngsters			1
the next stop in our journey was a real treat for me			1
@entity28 wanted to take me back to near where we had been filming three years ago			1
this time i was going to be horse riding at the quite wonderful @entity30 @entity209 camp , @entity210 , where they have 48 of the best looked - after horses i have ever seen			0
a family of giraffe gather alongside the majestic @entity165 in @entity2 rides at @entity210 are more adventurous in the mornings than the afternoons , and we took the opportunity to get some speed up in the open floodplains			1
it is quite incredible to approach buffalo , giraffe , elephants and zebra ( my favourites ! ) on horseback			0
@entity227 is set in a beautiful area right in the heart of the @entity5 , and is only accessible by light aircraft or helicopter			0
while i was riding , @entity28 took @entity22 off for gamedrives , boat cruises or fishing			1
every meal was taken out under the beautiful @entity30 starry night sky , and all the staff were so welcoming and friendly			0
we really felt at home here and were very sad to leave			0
from @entity210 , we flew off to @entity241 in the very north of @entity2 and then crossed the mighty @entity242 to reach the final destination in our journey , @entity245 , on the @entity247 side of @entity248			1
on our first morning in our very spacious room at @entity251 & @entity252 lodge , upstream of @entity248 , we woke up to the sounds of the @entity242			0
a leopard lazes on a branch - also in the area @entity23 saw honey badgers , wild dogs and a hyena den after so much activity and travelling , i was looking forward to a relaxing morning			1
i went off for a spa treatment overlooking the river and fell asleep in no time			0
i was ready for this			0
@entity28 surprised us at lunchtime with a trip into @entity245 , and before we knew it we were being whisked off in a helicopter for a scenic flight over @entity248			1
it is very easy to see from that perspective why it is one of the seven natural wonders of the world			0
the date happened to be friday the 13th , and a full moon was due			0
late in the afternoon , @entity28 took us for a walk around the falls and , after exploring for some time , we were surprised to find a small table set up with snacks and champagne			1
we sipped and nibbled away as the moon rose in the east behind a small cloud bank and created the amazing effect of a rainbow in the spray of @entity248			0
it was surreal and amazing all at the same time			0
elephants get their feet wet in the @entity5 back at @entity251 & @entity252 we were waited on like royalty			0
the food was spectacular in taste and presentation			0
the staff set up a private dinner for us at the edge of the @entity242 with a fireplace and yet more champagne			0
we ate to the sounds of hippos grunting in the distance , the flowing water and the crackling of the fire			0
on our last full day , @entity28 took us to @entity310 which sits at the very top of the falls			1
here we had a very traditional brunch of eggs benedict and tea , while being a matter of feet away from the edge of the waterfall			0
@entity248 are a mile wide and @entity310 sits about halfway along the top			0
we were guided to the edge of the falls and given the most incredible view over the brink , looking the 360ft down into the gorge			0
there is so much spray that there are rainbows all over the place			0
@entity331 gold medallist @entity23 sets off for glory in @entity9 and beaming with her gold medal before we left @entity2 , we headed into the @entity248 national park for a walk to find rhinos			1
this did n't take long as the park is very small and rangers follow the rhino around 24 hours a day , to protect them from poachers			0
being so close to such a huge animal on foot , was both exciting and terrifying all at once			0
we saw seven different rhino , including one very cute baby with its mother			0
it was also heartening to know that i was contributing in a small way to the value of the rhino as a tourist attraction , rather than as a medicine			0
@entity28 and @entity41 had introduced us to a different way of taking a holiday			1
our trip to @entity2 was , in fact , not just a holiday but a journey full of experiences			1
we will go back on safari to @entity30 again one day because i know i will have to feed the piece of my soul that @entity30 has claimed			2
@entity365 ( golden - africa.com ) offers four - star safaris starting from £ 2,995pp for eight nights			0
a 12 - night safari staying three nights each at @entity77 , @entity166 , @entity370 and @entity371 & @entity252 costs from £ 6,495pp , including internal transfers and fully inclusive accommodation			2
