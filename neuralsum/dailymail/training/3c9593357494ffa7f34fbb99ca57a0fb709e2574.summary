one of the most common questions in gardening is : ' how should i prune ? ' usually followed by : ' when should i do that ? ' but a bigger question is why ? so , here 's a thumbnail guide			1
@entity7 alters the way plants grow , so you can turn a natural growing tree into an espalier			1
and it helps to maintain plant health			2
removing leggy , diseased shoots cuts the risk of infection			1
we can prune to rejuvenate old or neglected shrubs , or to make certain plants — roses , wisteria , currants — flower or fruit more			1
shrubs or trees can also be cut back to maintain their size and natural appearance			1
in formal gardens , pruning takes place in the form of hedge clipping , topiary and bonsai training			2
most pruning is pretty straightforward , but developing young fruit trees is complex			1
if you want to try fan - training , cordon or spindlebush pruning , use a good manual			2
i swear by the @entity46 ( @entity47 , £ 35 )			2
to be young again pruning alters the way that the plants grow so you can turn a natural growing tree into an espalier winter is the season for restorative pruning			1
with mature , neglected trees — fruit or ornamental — thin overcrowded branches and , if necessary , remove surplus limbs to develop an airy , hollow - centred crown			1
old or weak trees often produce upright stems , or ' water shoots ' , from main branches and the trunk			1
new life can be given to old , bushy or exhausted shrubs by cutting the whole plant back to 60cm , or to dormant buds at that height			1
treat big shrub roses , mock orange and viburnums in this way			0
but do n't hack back non-vigorous rhododendrons , witch hazel , daphnes or slow - growing shrubs			1
smaller pruning jobs remove any thin , weak or awkwardly growing stems form roses , they can be pruned between now and march roses , particularly hybrid teas , floribundas and patio varieties can be pruned fairly hard between now and march			0
remove any thin , weak , ageing or awkwardly growing stems			0
cut back remaining stems to an outward - facing bud , removing about a third of the growth			0
shrub roses , or any that flower only once a year , need less attention			0
remove old flowers and spindly or diseased stems			0
late summer shrubs , particularly @entity98 , some hypericums , hardy hibiscus and big hydrangeas such as @entity102 can be pruned in late winter / early spring			1
you can savage buddleias , cutting back to low buds			0
with hardy hibiscus , prune stems by a third			0
mop - head hydrangeas need only the dead blooms removing , but cut other kinds harder back			0
spring - flowering clematis should n't be touched , but those that flower from late june can be cut back hard			0
if you prune the wrong ones by mistake , do n't despair — you 'll only lose some of this spring 's show			1
that 's the beauty of pruning : though you may make mistakes , recovery is almost inevitable			2
