by @entity0 published : 20:18 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 19 november 2012 mps will have the chance to deny prisoners the vote once and for all , following a bitter seven - year dispute with the @entity6			1
a free vote is set to be held on maintaining the blanket ban , as demanded by @entity9 who said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel sick			1
justice secretary @entity13 insists parliament has the right to reject the controversial @entity17 ruling , although @entity18 could be slapped with a fine , and a compensation bill from prisoners suing the government which could run to £ 100million			1
sickening : @entity9 said the idea of prisoners voting made him feel sick while justice secretary @entity13 insists parliament has the right to reject the ruling from the @entity6 mr @entity13 will lay out three options for consultation in a draft bill on thursday - retaining the current ban , or allowing votes for certain prisoners serving up to six months or up to four years			1
friday is the deadline to comply with the 2005 @entity6 ruling that denying prisoners the vote breaches their human rights			1
the @entity6 says individual countries can decide which prisoners should be denied votes , but not impose a total ban			2
a vote on the law would not be held before next year but @entity18 is highly unlikely to comply with the @entity6 as a non-binding vote last february saw an overwhelming vote of 234 mps to 22 back maintaining the ban			0
obligation : attorney general @entity48 says that legally @entity18 must comply with the directive @entity50 yesterday voiced its support for the status quo , saying the @entity6 should respect @entity18 ’s ‘ sensible and proportionate ’ stance			0
few @entity54 are expected to rebel			0
while concerns have been raised by attorney general @entity48 that @entity18 is under an international legal obligation to comply , the prime minister is determined to stand firm			0
he told @entity45 last month he was happy to introduce legislation to ‘ help put the legal position beyond doubt ’ and said ‘ no - one should be in any doubt : prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			1
’ @entity68 mp @entity67 welcomed what he said was ‘ the government for the first time ... saying @entity72 ’s decisions will overrule the @entity6 ’			2
he added : ‘ the @entity18 people want @entity72 to be supreme , ignore this @entity74 @entity6			0
’ shadow home secretary @entity75 said a vote on legislation would strengthen the @entity18 ’s argument on retaining the ban , and that passing a binding law - rather than a motion as in the past - could force the @entity6 to look at the issue again			2
however critics fear @entity18 ’s hands could be tied			0
@entity50 mp @entity85 said ignoring the @entity6 ’s ruling would leave ministers unable to criticise countries which flout the rules and summarily lock up their citizens			2
he said : ‘ if you say total defiance of the @entity6 , your influence criticising any other country that breach the @entity6 is zero			0
’ warning : @entity50 mp @entity85 and @entity68 mp @entity95 have warned about going against @entity17 law the government is being sued by 500 inmates for being denied the vote			1
yesterday their lawyer @entity100 of law firm @entity101 said the claims were already ‘ running into the millions ’ and that the vote was ‘ unlikely to satisfy the court or stave off costly legal action			0
’ under the @entity108 ruling , the government has until thursday to come forward with proposals for ending @entity18 ’s ‘ general , automatic and indiscriminate disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners			1
’ @entity95 , the @entity68 mp and a former lawyer at the @entity114 , said : ‘ we are heading for a constitutional clash , putting @entity108 ’s political agenda on a collision course with @entity18 ’s democratic prerogatives			0
’ a @entity121 spokesperson said the government was ‘ considering how best to proceed following the judgment of the @entity6 of the @entity6 ’ and that an announcement would be made to @entity72 shortly			2

justice secretary @entity13 says parliament has the right to reject @entity17 ruling
but prisoners could sue the government for anything up to £ 100m
