only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for ‘ some crimes ’ , down from 54 per cent in 2013 , according to a @entity3 study			1
it is the first time that support has fallen below 50 per cent since @entity3 began asking the public for its views on capital punishment in 1986			1
support for the death penalty stood at 74 per cent in 1986 but had fallen to 59 per cent by 1998 , according to the social research institute			1
the survey also found that at present @entity17 voters are more likely to support the death penalty , with 75 per cent in favour			1
@entity19 , co-head of social attitudes at @entity3 , said : “ the big change in public attitudes to the death penalty came in the 1990s at a time when attitudes to a range of other issues , like same - sex relationships and sex before marriage were also liberalising			2
“ this more recent change is interesting because attitudes have stayed fairly steady for a number of years			0
“ it could be the continuation of this liberalising trend or , perhaps , a response to the shocking botched executions in the @entity38 that were widely reported in april and july of last year			0
” @entity39 , executive director of the legal charity @entity40 , said : “ this welcome finding finally debunks the myth that , given half the chance , the @entity44 people would vote to bring back hanging			2
“ in fact , the trend is clear			0
@entity47 in increasing numbers agree that the death penalty has no place in a civilised society			2

@entity53 's governor signed a law that makes his state the only one to allow firing squads following botched lethal injections “ capital punishment has little to do with justice or crime deterrence , and all countries , including the @entity44 , should be working towards global abolition			2
” in one incident in the @entity38 last april , 38 - year - old convicted murderer @entity65 died 43 minutes after his lethal injection process began in @entity68			0
in july of that year , another controversial @entity38 execution took place involving convicted killer @entity71 , 55 , who took two hours to die following the start of his lethal injection process at @entity73 in @entity74			0
