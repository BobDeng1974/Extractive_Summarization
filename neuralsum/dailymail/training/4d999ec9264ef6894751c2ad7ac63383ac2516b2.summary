@entity1 , 68 , returned home completely unaware of the seriousness of his condition			1
he continued to feel desperately unwell and only found out he had terminal lung cancer after being taken to another hospital where the news of his condition was revealed			1
he died just days later without ever returning home			2
yesterday the hospital responsible apologised to his family saying there had been ‘ errors in communication			2
’ but last night his family said they were still reeling from the ‘ appalling ’ oversight and had been left ‘ heartbroken and angry ’ by the shocking mistake			0
his daughter @entity22 , 46 , said : ‘ because we did n’t know his condition was so grave , my dad ’s grandchildren were abroad on holiday in @entity27 and were unable to say goodbye before he died			0
‘ the whole family is heartbroken about that and still coming to terms with it			0
‘ if action had been taken sooner , my dad could have been given more time with his family and would have had the opportunity to come to terms with his illness , put his affairs in order and say goodbye			0
’ mr @entity1 from @entity41 , @entity42 , died six weeks after first visiting his gp in july 2009 following his concerns about painful lumps he had developed across his body			1
the retired warehouse supervisor was referred to the @entity48 where on august 1 he was admitted for tests			1
a complete set of tests was carried out which revealed he was suffering from cancer and that the disease had spread throughout his body and was terminal			1
but despite the diagnosis , neither the patient nor his family were informed about his condition			2
he was allowed to go home two days later but continued to feel desperately unwell and on 16 august he was taken to the accident and emergency department of the @entity58			1
awful : the pensioner only found out he had terminal lung cancer after being taken to another hospital where the news of his condition was revealed once there a doctor broke the news to mr @entity1 that scans he had previously at the @entity48 showed he had terminal lung cancer			1
mr @entity1 ’ wife @entity68 and children , @entity22 , @entity70 and @entity71 , had hoped to take him home to spend quality time together			2
but they were advised by doctors that he was too frail to survive the eight - mile journey and he died at the hospital just five days later			0
his daughter @entity77 , from @entity78 , near @entity79 , said : ‘ my dad was a devoted husband , father and grandfather and an important figure in all our lives			0
‘ the rapid deterioration in his health took us all by surprise and we feel absolutely devastated about losing him so quickly and in such circumstances			1
‘ the @entity48 made no attempt to contact us about my dad ’s condition and the terrible results of the scan after he was discharged , which we are really angry about			2
’ worrying : tests at the @entity48 revealed mr @entity1 was suffering from terminal cancer but neither the patient nor his family were informed about his condition she said : ‘ we accept the cancer was too severe to treat with surgery or chemotherapy , but if doctors had shared information about his condition earlier he could have also received access to palliative care to make his life more comfortable			1
‘ we accept the @entity108 ’s apology and are reassured that staff have changed their processes to ensure other families will not have to go through the same ordeal in future			0
’ dr @entity114 , medical director at @entity108 , said in a statement : ‘ we fully accept that there were errors in communication made in mr @entity1 ’ case in 2009 and have apologised to his family			2
‘ we realise that we ca n’t alter the outcome for them , but we examined the circumstances carefully so that we could learn from where we went wrong			0
‘ this was a very sad situation that no family should have had to go through and which we regret deeply			0
‘ [ please leave @entity128 quote ] @entity129 , the family ’s solicitor at @entity128 law firm , said : ‘ the lack of communication between departments is appalling			0
‘ the trust ’s apology has been noted and we hope that staff have taken this on board to ensure that , particularly in cases where patients sadly have little time left , test results are acted on			0
