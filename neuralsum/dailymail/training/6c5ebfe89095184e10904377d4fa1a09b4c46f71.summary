@entity0 apologised for his part in @entity4 ’s @entity3 downfall last year , then set about backing his words with something more substantial as @entity7 hailed his new centre forward a £ 32million bargain			1
@entity0 scored twice in the first eight minutes as @entity7 ’s team beat @entity11 at @entity12 in their final pre-season friendly before their @entity15 campaign starts at @entity16 on monday			1
‘ the market is crazy and for strikers even more so , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ for a striker like him , who is a champion in @entity23 and a @entity25 finalist , who is young , only 25 years old , we consider the price was very much in our favour , considering the values in the market			2
goals : costa 1 ' 7 ' @entity11 : @entity58 , @entity59 ( @entity60 59 ' ) , @entity61 ( @entity47 11 ' ) , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 ' ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 59 ' ) , @entity67 ( @entity68 72 ' ) , @entity69 ( @entity70 65 ' ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 72 ' ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 72 ' ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 65 ' ) subs ( not used ) : @entity78 , @entity79			1
player ratings by @entity82 's @entity81 at @entity12 ‘ @entity0 is a team player ; he works a lot for the team			1
it ’s not just about his goals			2
it ’s about his defensive work , his mentality , his ambition			2
this is the player we bought ; the player we were waiting for last season			2
‘ it ’s the reason we did not buy a striker in the winter market			2
we were waiting for him			0
we have him and he looks adapted to the team , to our style of play and the @entity15 should be happy because sometimes we lose important players to other countries			0
’ @entity0 was playing at @entity12 for the first time since scoring a penalty for @entity105 when they beat @entity4 in the @entity25 semi-final in april and he needed only 57 seconds to find the net last night , converting a pass from @entity42			1
‘ i can say i ’m really sorry for the part i played in the game we won , ’ wrote @entity0 in the latest edition of the @entity4 magazine			1
‘ i hope my actions on the pitch and my feet will do the talking and then people can decide if i ’m a good player or not , if i ’m improving or not			0
‘ all i can say is that i love playing hard and fairly			0
joining was an easy decision for me			0
we have some of the best players in the world , the best manager in the world and it ’s a club with great history			0
‘ i want to improve , not only as a player but as an individual , and i believe this is the perfect place for me to do that			0
that ’s the reason i chose @entity4 and why i want to defend this shirt			1
’ remember the name : @entity4 's new forward celebrates scoring his first goal at @entity12 embraced : and he is hugged by captain @entity38 as he enjoys the moment doubled up : @entity51 goes down under a challenge from @entity69 double : and @entity0 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring the second soon after his second owed everything to @entity48 , who thumped a post from the corner of the penalty box and the rebound dropped at the feet of @entity0 , who tapped in with his left foot			1
it took his goal tally to four in pre-season and a full - house were soon singing his name			1
@entity0 went close to his hat - trick in the second - half before he was replaced by @entity50 on the hour			0
forgiven ? you bet , just keep ’ em coming , seemed to be the consensus as he acknowledged the standing ovation			2
at this point he looks every inch the goalscoring centre forward @entity7 bemoaned the lack of last season			0
apart from teenager @entity40 at left back , @entity7 started with what appears to be his strongest team , which looked well - balanced and powerful , although the second half was littered with substitutions			0
@entity33 was preferred in goal to @entity54 , the strongest indicator to date that the @entity173 has the edge in the tussle to be @entity177 goalkeeper			2
the rest of the back four was as it was for most of last season , with @entity38 and @entity36 in the centre and @entity34 at right - back			0
@entity44 anchored the midfield , with @entity46 and @entity42 on either side			1
up front , @entity51 and @entity48 flanked @entity0			0
@entity41 was one of four changes at half - time and quickly impressed with a dashing overlap and dangerous cross			1
there are still areas where the squad seems thin , but it is stronger than this time last year			0
much will hinge on @entity0 and his ability to keep finding the net — and the signs are positive			0
watching on : @entity7 keeps an eye on the action from the touchline @entity200 is the colour : @entity46 wearing a @entity4 kit at @entity12 for the first time somewhere : over the rainbow of @entity12 down : @entity43 holds his right leg after hitting the turf embrace : @entity50 smiles as he replaces fellow @entity209 costa run out : another new boy @entity41 also made his first appearance at @entity12 return : and @entity49 was back in action following his @entity214 escapades with @entity215			1

costa nets twice in first 10 minutes as @entity4 beat @entity11
first goal came *inside* a minute with the next coming in the *seventh*
@entity46 and @entity41 also make first @entity12 appearances
