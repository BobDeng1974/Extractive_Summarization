by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 5 march 2013 a @entity2 grandmother has become the first person in the world to be fitted with a life - saving ' miniature sieve ' to prevent blood clots			1
@entity7 , 80 , was fitted with the revolutionary device by doctors at the @entity10 in @entity11 during a 15 - minute procedure			1
the surgery involves inserting a specially - designed titanium filter via a catheter into a major vein that carries blood to the heart			1
mrs @entity7 said it was ' a privilege ' to be the first patient to undergo the procedure once inserted into the inferior vena cava - the wire mesh or cage is inflated and acts to catch any clots before they travel to the lungs			1
doctors believe the procedure could prevent thousands dying from blood clots after surgery			1
mrs @entity7 , from @entity33 , had the device put in on thursday following a major bowel operation			1
she said it was ' a privilege ' to be the first patient to undergo the procedure			0
' i ’m quite happy everyone knows what they ’re doing and i just let them get on with it , ' she added			0
dr @entity45 , a consultant at the hospital , said patients can be at higher risk of blood clots following surgery but using anti-clotting drugs could be risky			1
however , other measures to catch clots also carry risks because they are difficult to insert and remove			2
he said the new device ' is something we can put in for a limited number of days and easily take out			0
' intensive care unit nurse @entity59 , 35 , pictured with the device - a titanium wire inside an 18 - inch - long tube pulmonary embolisms - blood clots which reach the lungs - kill an estimated 25,000 people a year in the @entity2			1
a spokesperson for @entity10 said : ' we are one of seven hospitals who are taking part in the project - six in the @entity2 and one in @entity75			0
' we did n’t expect to be the first in the world - our @entity79 team had only received their training a few hours prior to @entity7 arriving in the unit following her surgery			2
' they realised that she could benefit from being fitted with the device so , after discussions with her , it was decided to go ahead			0
' one of the nurses involved in the procedure , @entity90 , said : ' i ’m really proud to have been part of the team and hopefully this will be of real benefit to a great many patients in the future			0
' surgeons at the @entity10 in @entity11 had received their training in fitting the device a few hours before mrs @entity7 was put forward for the procedure dr @entity45 added : ' with the existing devices patients had to be taken down for a specialist procedure with could take up to three hours in total			2
' obviously , moving patients from intensive care is something we try to avoid			0
' this new procedure can be carried out within an hour of the patient arriving in intensive care and takes only 15 minutes			0
' @entity7 had the device removed yesterday afternoon - five days after it was installed as she no longer needs it .			2

@entity7 had the device fitted in a major vein near her heart
it consists of a titanium mesh that acts like a *fishing* net to catch blood clots
doctors believe it could prevent thousands dying from clots after surgery
