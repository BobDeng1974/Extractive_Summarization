@entity0 feels @entity2 's desire for a new challenge was the driving force behind his decision to quit @entity6			1
the @entity8 team confirmed at the start of the month the man they helped win four consecutive @entity12 titles would be departing at the end of the year , with @entity14 promoted to his race seat from @entity16			0
although the @entity18 - based marque did not mention where @entity2 was heading , team principal @entity20 later let the cat out of the bag by revealing @entity23 had poached the 26 - year - old @entity24			1
@entity2 is set to leave @entity6 at the end of the season and could join @entity27 ( left ) at @entity23 @entity0 , who has outshone team - mate @entity2 this season , has so far won three races this year when @entity0 first heard the news he concedes he was far from surprised , saying : ' i was pretty open to anything			1
' i expected him to leave , so i was n't shocked when he announced he was leaving			0
' the way i see it , he has won four titles with @entity6 and obviously he has an opportunity elsewhere			2
@entity2 won four consecutive drivers ' titles with @entity6 and established himself as the best in the world @entity2 is pictured in the @entity6 garage during practice for the @entity43 @entity42 ' before he sees himself getting a bit too old for the sport , he probably wants another challenge			2
' the suspicion is @entity0 has also put @entity2 's nose out of joint as the latter was understandably the dominant force in his previous relationship with former team - mate @entity53			1
but in a car not to his liking following the changes brought about by the introduction this year of the 1.6 - litre @entity60 turbo - charged power units , @entity2 has been outperformed by @entity0			2
@entity0 , on the podium having won the @entity62 , is not surprised that @entity2 is leaving @entity6 members of the @entity65 team celebrate winning the constructors ' championship at the @entity68 @entity42 @entity69 and @entity70 were first and second in @entity71 to wrap up @entity65 ' constructors ' title other than @entity65 duo @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity0 is the only other driver to win a race this season , taking the chequered flag on three occasions			1
@entity0 insists , however , in public @entity2 has accepted his fate with good grace			2
' he has been fair with me from day one , and after the third win was still very fair and very respectful with me , ' added @entity0			0
@entity23 's @entity82 ( right ) says it is ' unlikely ' that he will be driving for @entity65 next season ' as the season goes on he would love a win , so maybe inside there is a bit more frustration			0
i am sure deep down he wants to get a win this year			0
' when you see a team - mate win races and you 're not , naturally you are frustrated , but i would n't say that has been displayed in meetings or anything i have seen			1
' to his credit he has n't taken anything out on me , or in front of the team			0
' maybe behind closed doors , but not visible to any of us , so i think he has controlled it well			0
