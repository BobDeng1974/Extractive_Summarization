published : 05:09 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 05:50 est , 16 july 2013 when motorcycle fanatic @entity1 spotted the bike of his dreams on sale for around £ 40 he was heartbroken			1
it was 1968 and as a penniless , 21 - year - old student he could n't scrape the funds together to buy the @entity10 classic			1
instead he advised his friend @entity11 to snap it up , insisting it was a fantastic find that would one day pay off			1
good turn : @entity1 was a struggling student when he advised his friend @entity11 to snap up the @entity10 in 1968 back in the driving seat : more than 40 years after @entity1 first set eyes on the @entity17 , he is now finally able to ride it heartbreak : @entity1 , pictured as a student in 1968 , did n't have the money to buy the @entity17 at the time for more than 40 years the pair still kept in touch from time to time and mr @entity1 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , always joked that he was now able to pay @entity11 £ 40 for the bike			1
in 2009 , he received a sad phone call to say @entity11 had passed away from pancreatic cancer - but in an unexpected final gesture of kindness , he had left mr @entity30 the 1937 @entity31 in his will			1
generous : @entity1 advised his friend @entity11 , pictured , to snap up the rare @entity17 the value of classic motorbikes has rocketed in the intervening years , and the rare motorcycle would now be expected to fetch around £ 225,000 if put up for auction			1
when mr @entity1 received the @entity38 - built @entity17 , the 15th of just 78 ever made , it was still in bits in the original tea chests it was first sold in			1
but he was determined to ride the bike just as he had always wanted , and spent eight months and around £ 10,000 restoring it			1
mr @entity1 , now 66 , said : ' my father used to have a @entity17 motorbike when i was a child and they really got into my blood			2
' he sold it in 1960 when i was only 13 and so i never had the chance to enjoy it			0
when i got my bike licence i decided i wanted a @entity17			2
one day i was at a bike meeting when i saw an amazing model , the @entity31 , that was made in the 1930s			0
' i fell in love with it straight away			0
two or three years later i had a call from a friend who told me there was a 1937 @entity31 for sale on the south coast			2
' he said it was in bits in a box and that the seller wanted £ 50 for it			0
' back then £ 50 was a lot of money and i was still a student			2
i asked my dad for the money but it was about four times his mortgage and he said no. ' seeing as i could n’t buy the bike i phoned a friend of mine , @entity11 , and told him about it			1
' @entity11 was a bit older and had a good job so he could afford to buy it			1
' time capsule : the classic bike arrived in two tea chests and had to be assembled by @entity1 from scratch time and effort : @entity1 spent eight months and more than £ 10,000 restoring the @entity17 ' he went to see the seller and managed to knock a tenner off so he got it for £ 40			1
' we remained friends and every few years when i would see him i would joke that i had the £ 40 to buy the bike now , and he would just smile at me			1
' mr @entity1 said he had no idea that @entity11 would have been so generous as to leave the much sought - after @entity17 to him			1
he added : ' it was very sad to hear @entity11 had died but at the same time i was told he had kindly left me the same @entity31 i had told him about all those years ago			1
' i was incredibly touched by the gesture			0
when the bike arrived it was still in bits , in exactly the same condition it was in in 1968			2
' i never thought for one moment that after 40 - odd years i would own the very same bike			2
i knew @entity11 would have wanted me to use the bike so i spent £ 10,000 restoring it over eight months			1
' it is a beautiful bike that still turns heads 75 years after it was made			0
i ’m determined to get out and ride it as much as i can - it ’s what @entity11 would have wanted			2
' @entity108 were once among the most desired models in the world			0
the company was founded in 1928 by @entity17 after he acquired a small motorbike manufacturing firm by the name of @entity114			0
based in @entity116 , @entity117 , engineers built high - speed motorbikes primarily for the expanding market in the @entity120			0
in 1948 , the ' @entity121 ' was hailed as the world 's fastest production - made motorcycle			0
a 1952 998cc model set a six - hour world speed record at more than 100mph - an incredible achievement for the era			0
the tiny @entity38 company was so far ahead of its time , it was n't until the 1970s that @entity133 manufacturers came along with faster production machines			0
@entity108 was forced to cease production in 1955 after suffering heavy financial losses			0
