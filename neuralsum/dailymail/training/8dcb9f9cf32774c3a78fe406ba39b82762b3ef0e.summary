legal experts have said @entity1 plans to charge @entity3 students university fees after independence could be in breach of the law charging @entity3 students up to £ 9000 in tuition fees if they attend @entity13 universities after independence would be illegal , experts in @entity10 law have ruled			1
the @entity1 - led @entity15 has said that @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 students would continue to pay fees following a yes vote in september ’s referendum , even though @entity13 students and those from other @entity10 countries outside of the @entity3 would continue to be entitled to free tuition			1
but two legal experts say that the controversial charging regime flouts @entity10 laws because it would be discriminatory			1
@entity29 ( @entity30 ) , professor of @entity31 at @entity32 , said the @entity15 would face ‘ an extremely steep uphill battle ’ to convince the @entity10 its plans were legal			0
and @entity35 , professor of @entity31 at @entity36 , branded the move as ‘ overt discrimination ’ against students from the rest of the @entity3 – and said it is ‘ hard to see ’ how it can be justified			2
their verdicts are contained within a new report due to be published tomorrow ( @entity46 ) by a collection of academics who have set up an offshoot of the @entity52 campaign			0
it is a blow to the @entity1 , as it is estimated that giving free education to students from the rest of the @entity3 would cost an extra £ 150 million – blowing a substantial hole in the nationalists ’ education budgets			1
professor @entity58 , former vice-principal of @entity59 and a member of the ‘ academics together ’ group , said : ‘ all the evidence points to the fact that @entity66 ’s assertions on tuition fees do n’t stand up to scrutiny			0
‘ the @entity15 should publish any legal advice on charging students in the rest of the @entity3 tuition fees if we go it alone , if any such advice even exists			1
‘ there is a real risk that the loss of funding from students in the rest of the @entity3 would have negative consequences on our ability to teach @entity13 ’s students			1
' the great irony of this issue is that the only way for the @entity15 to guarantee its policy on tuition fees stays in place is for @entity13 to remain in the @entity3			1
‘ @entity89 is a gamble we do n’t need to take			0
as part of the @entity3 we have the best of both worlds : we have a strong @entity95 taking important decisions about our universities and colleges - and we can benefit from being part of the larger @entity3 research system and the disproportionate share of @entity3 research funding we receive			2
under the current funding system , @entity10 and @entity13 students are entitled to ‘ free ’ higher education in @entity13 while @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 youngsters pay up to £ 9,000 a year			1
experts say @entity13 would have to treat the rest of the @entity3 like all other @entity109 countries following independence the @entity1 ’s white paper on independence states that ‘ the @entity15 proposes to maintain the status quo by continuing our current policy of charging fees to students from the rest of the @entity3 to study at @entity13 higher education institutions ’			1
the new academics together report states that the proposals would ‘ run into significant problems with @entity109 law ’			2
it goes on : ‘ if @entity13 leaves the @entity3 and joins the @entity10 as a separate state , the rest of the @entity3 will become like any other @entity10 country			2
‘ as a result , @entity13 will be legally obliged to provide university education free to students from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17			1
’ however , higher education body @entity130 has said that its own legal advice suggests it ‘ would be possible ’ to continue the policy			0
a spokesman for @entity1 education secretary @entity135 said : ‘ @entity136 is consistent with , and informed by , legal advice the government has received			2
‘ the content of any legal advice is confidential			0
by long standing convention , successive @entity13 and @entity140 governments have not disclosed the source or content of legal advice other than in the most exceptional circumstances			0
‘ there is however , very clear legal opinion already published by the universities themselves on this issue			0
it makes clear the possibility of continuing the current system within @entity10 law			0
‘ it is entirely legitimate , of course , for people to express other views and that is a debate we welcome			0
what is a nonsense is for the no @entity166 to ignore the substantial and credible advice provided to @entity130 – a body of impeccable neutrality on the question of independence			0

@entity1 to charge @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17 students after yes vote
legal experts say charging fees would be in breach of the law
@entity13 to treat rest of @entity3 like @entity109 countries following independence
@entity3 students currently pay £ 9,000 a year to attend @entity13 universities
