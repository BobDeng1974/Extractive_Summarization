by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 13:42 est , 15 april 2013 flamboyant @entity2 designer @entity1 lost his job at fashion house @entity5 two years ago after he was filmed delivering an anti-semitic outburst			2
and although he has started to pick up the pieces professionally , landing a gig working with prestigious label @entity10 and currying favour once more with @entity13 and fashion 's elite it seems that not everybody is ready to forgive and forget			0
according to a report on @entity18 the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) have banned @entity20 , the @entity22 entrant in next month ’s @entity23 , from wearing a dress by the designer on air			1
disgraced designer @entity1 was filmed praising @entity27 during a drunken rant and accused of making anti-semitic remarks during a dispute at a trendy @entity32 cafe it has been reported that @entity1 was among several designers invited to create an outfit for the performance before a rep from the @entity19 sent her agent a memo prohibiting them from working with the designer			1
the memo claimed that @entity1 ’s actions ' preclude ' him ' from dressing the @entity22 @entity23 representative , at a time when racism and anti-semitism is rampant in @entity49 , even if he had apologized			1
' having publicly forgiven galliiano his previous transgression the @entity51 ’s national director @entity50 does n’t agree with the @entity19 ’s decision			0
he said in a statement to @entity55 that he is ' outraged and embarrassed that an entity representing @entity22 would reject mr. @entity1 , ' adding : ' this is not the lesson that you give your children			2
rejecting someone who gave a sincere apology is not @entity63 tradition			0
we are a people that forgive and this is not the way to overcome bigotry			0
' in 2012 @entity69 ( left ) scored a total of just 12 in the competition			0
this year 's entrant @entity73 ( right ) is hoping to place better when she represents the @entity74 in a further twist to the story @entity1 's publicist @entity77 has denied that the designer was ever contacted to create a performance outfit for @entity22 's @entity23 entrant @entity20			1
@entity77 told @entity81 : ' mr. @entity1 was never asked nor was there any communication regarding being asked to design for @entity22 's contestant for @entity23 contest			1
@entity1 has been hard at work on his sobriety and his efforts to seek forgiveness from those he offended			0

reports centre on a *leaked* memo from the @entity19
@entity22 contestant @entity94 's *stylist* in talks with several designers
@entity1 's rep denies he was ever involved , says he is working on ' sobriety '
