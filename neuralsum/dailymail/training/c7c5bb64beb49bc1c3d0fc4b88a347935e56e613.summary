cradled lovingly in her mother ’s arms , this is beautiful @entity4 , whose tragic story moved the @entity6 to tears this week			1
born a year ago today , with a crop of flame - red hair and mischievous brown eyes , she was just 89 days old when she died from a rare heart condition , holding her inconsolable parents ’ hands			1
on tuesday , her grieving mother , @entity14 , spoke publicly about her family ’s utter devastation at losing their beloved ‘ @entity17 ’			1
mrs @entity4 also talked of her hope that her tiny daughter ’s battle for life would inspire others to build a £ 10 million hospice in @entity39 for other children suffering from life - limiting illnesses			1
her heartbreaking honesty prompted @entity6 — who is 18 weeks pregnant with her second child — to throw her arms around her afterwards and whisper : ‘ you ’re a very brave lady			0
i ’m just so , so sorry			0
’ though today she should have been celebrating @entity4 ’s first birthday , mrs @entity4 has written a deeply moving account of her daughter ’s cruelly short life , in order to highlight the remarkable work of @entity55 ’s children ’s @entity53 ( @entity56 ) , of which the @entity6 is royal patron			1
she has also given permission for the @entity58 to publish these remarkable photographs of the baby girl with the enchanting smile who touched so many lives			1
tragically , they were taken just hours before @entity4 , who had been born small but apparently healthy , was taken into hospital for the last time			2
mrs @entity4 , a 33 - year - old physiotherapist , her husband , @entity67 , and their four - year - old son , @entity68 , had spent that january day with their friend , photographer @entity70			2
despite being fitted with a feeding tube , brave @entity4 accepted her condition without protest — just plenty of smiles			1
the family , who live near @entity78 , enjoyed a remarkably idyllic afternoon at their local park , splashing in puddles and enjoying the fresh air			2
fragile : @entity17 's tiny fingers - she would later die in hospital while holding both her parents ' hands tender : a kiss from @entity14 as dad @entity67 cradles @entity90 on their final day out before she was taken to hospital but just hours later , @entity4 ’s condition deteriorated			1
she was given emergency ventilation and , after treatment locally , was rushed to the @entity96 at @entity97 ( @entity97 )			0
mrs @entity4 remembers : ‘ over the next few weeks , our immensely brave girl battled so hard , giving everything she had			1
the courage @entity17 showed for someone so young was inspirational			2
‘ sadly , her mountain proved too hard to climb for someone so young , and she became frailer and weaker			0
as a mother , watching this was agony			2
' we knew our little girl was just too tired and could fight her battle no longer			2
‘ on february 24 , 2014 , she sadly passed away in my arms at @entity97 , holding her @entity108 ’s and @entity110 ’s hands			0
we were , and are , devastated			0
’ @entity4 ’s death came just weeks after the family had spent a first blissful @entity113 together , entirely unaware of her condition			1
empathy : @entity116 of @entity117 was pictured in tears earlier this week after meeting @entity14 , who she described as ' very brave ' ‘ for six weeks we enjoyed a normal life as a new family of four , enjoying @entity113 with our beautiful @entity17			1
our amazing little girl completed us as a family , ’ her mother recalls			1
but in early january @entity4 became unwell , struggling to feed or breathe			2
she quickly developed cardiac failure and it was later confirmed that she had a very rare disease of the heart : restrictive cardiomyopathy			2
‘ we , as a family , were in shock that our little girl could have been so poorly and we had no idea , ’ mrs @entity4 says			1
‘ she was so perfect			0
our joy and excitement became despair			0
’ it was in the days after @entity4 ’s death that @entity56 stepped in , taking her tiny body back to its hospice at @entity140 , @entity39 , and allowing the family the chance to say their precious farewells in private			1
‘ as soon as we arrived we were made to feel at home , ’ mrs @entity4 says			1
‘ she arrived in a @entity146 basket and had her own room , with her name on the door , and was cared for with such respect and dignity by everyone			0
‘ as parents , we could not have asked for a better way to say goodbye in the worst of situations			0
’ @entity56 was instrumental in helping to organise their baby ’s funeral at a time when , mrs @entity4 admits , ‘ we were barely functioning ’			1
mr and mrs @entity4 say the help of the hospice has been ‘ invaluable in our darkest times ’			2
it was in the aftermath of their loss that mrs @entity4 wrote to the @entity6 about the support they ’d received			1
‘ i was so touched to receive her reply , hand - signed , and obviously written from the heart			0
it was clear from her words that she is so passionate about children ’s hospice care and @entity56			0
’ later , she was invited to meet the @entity178 at tuesday ’s launch of a fundraising campaign to help each build its new facility			0
it was , she says , a moment she will never forget			0
‘ as the @entity6 was leaving , she made a detour to find me , having to weave around a table and high chair , and gave me a hug			0
she just said i “ was such a brave lady ”			0
‘ she was a bit teary - eyed , and i certainly was			0
i think it just proves how much she cares , and how natural she is as a person , showing such empathy and understanding as a mother			0
’ while mrs @entity4 admits it has been a ‘ difficult ’ few days , she takes some comfort in how the story of @entity4 ’s bravery may help to support other families in the same desperate situation			1
‘ as a parent , you hope that your children will make you proud , ’ she says			0
‘ my little girl has achieved more in her 89 days of life through the telling of her story , and what she has inspired , than i think most of us could achieve in a lifetime			1
