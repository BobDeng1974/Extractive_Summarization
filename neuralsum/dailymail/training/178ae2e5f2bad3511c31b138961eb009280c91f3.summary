mr @entity49 said he has a meeting set up with @entity4 officials to discuss what happened at his resort , and pending the outcome of that meeting might pursue criminal action			1

' there were broken ceiling tiles in the hallway , broken furniture , broken windows			0
there 's carpet that 's going to need to be replaced			0
the rooms were just a pigsty			0
' they caused an excessive amount of damage			2
' @entity27 chapter president @entity81 previously said his members ' are embarrassed and ashamed of the behavior ' of some members			1

' this behavior is inconsistent with the values , policies , and practices of this organization , ' @entity108 said			0
' we will work within our own organization and with university officials to hold those who are responsible accountable for their actions			0
' similar charges may also be brought up by the @entity120 here members of @entity122 and @entity123 fraternities held another party that same weekend in conjunction with the @entity128 and @entity129 sororities			1

the fraternity and sorority are accused of wrecking their rooms at the @entity31 in @entity32 @entity148 said they are not releasing images of the damage , since the management company does not own the building and publishing the pictures would be a violation of their landlord 's privacy			1
' one of the group 's units was far worse than the other , ' @entity148 told the @entity162			0
' obviously our owners are not pleased			0
showing this level of extreme disregard to our properties is ridiculous			0

they also wo n't be able to vote in @entity11 life councils			0
university spokesman @entity207 says the suspension gives the university and authorities time to investigate the incident and determine appropriate action			0
' it 's more important to make sure we get the right information and move forward following our established processes than to do it by a specific deadline , ' mr @entity207 said			0
the university community has expressed scorn at the way the fraternity and sorority members represented their institution - ranked one of the top public colleges in the nation - during the out - of - control weekend ski trip			1
' these incidents simply do not reflect the @entity4 's values or its expectations , ' said @entity232 , vice president for student life			2
' the behaviors are a contradiction of what it means to be in and of a community , and we do not believe that being away from campus is a license to act in destructive and irresponsible ways			2
' three student body leaders also reacted to the incident this week			0
the joint letter from student body president @entity246 , @entity248 president @entity247 and @entity250 president @entity249 wrote that the parties were ' an act of shocking disrespect '			0
' we , as leaders and @entity256 at the @entity4 , do not tolerate these kinds of acts , nor do we let such behavior fall under the radar			2
we intend to handle this situation with the utmost efficiency , and we will ensure that those responsible for the damage to the properties will be held accountable throughout this process , ' the statement reads .			2
