@entity0 are the star attraction in tuesday night 's @entity3 final in @entity4 , but what about opponents @entity5 ? @entity8 gives you the lowdown			1
how do we sum up @entity5 ? character and characters			1
always well supported by wonderfully loud fans who belt out the @entity5 anthem and do a superb @entity17 , @entity5 were boisterously led for 11 years by president @entity18 until he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his part in a municipal embezzlement scandal			1
his replacement @entity24 is a more low - key leader but the club still do their best to shake up the big two			2
a trip to their concrete bowl @entity32 stadium is normally not one that @entity0 relish and back in 2007 under @entity34 they even stayed in the title race until the last weekend of the season			2
@entity5 wanted the @entity3 final against @entity58 ’s @entity57 cancelled but it was played two days after his funeral and they lost 3 - 1			1
the dignity with which they still honour their former player is a credit to the club and the supporters – expect @entity51 ’s name to be sung in @entity4			2
so class off the pitch ... and pedigree on it , despite the underdog status ? they ’ve won seven cups ( including the @entity41 three times ) since 2000 so yes they ’ve got something about them			2
@entity0 will do well to take nothing for granted then ? @entity5 in their pomp – with @entity79 and @entity80 hurtling down the right wing together and @entity82 and @entity83 converting the crosses , were a match for anyone , @entity0 included			1
but financial restraints have made it ever more difficult to compete			0
prized asset : @entity79 moved from @entity5 to @entity90 in the summer of 2013 selling club : @entity92 was the latest star to leave @entity5 , this time for @entity93 this summer a selling club ? that ’s putting it mildly			1
from @entity80 and @entity98 to @entity93 in 2008 it ’s been an annual exodus			1
they sold @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 last year and this year it ’s @entity92			2
the best player nearly always leaves at the end of the season			2
so how did the win the @entity41 last season having sold their stars ? their manic coach @entity109 is one of the best in @entity112			1
his intensive man - management style can be draining for the players but they love him because he gets results			0
crouching , gesticulating , grimacing and just generally bobbing up and down in his technical area he sweats as much as some of his players			0
with limited resources he has done well throughout his career			0
and on the pitch ? they still have talent			0
@entity127 striker and former bus conductor @entity126 scored 21 goals in his first season last year and is still leading the line despite interest from @entity133			1
@entity135 keeper @entity134 was exceptional in the @entity41 final			1
@entity137 is wanted by @entity138 and @entity139 has arrived from @entity138 with plenty to prove after last season ’s disappointment			0
man at the helm : coach @entity109 is intensive and manic , but has led @entity5 to success star : @entity126 scored 21 goals in his first season with @entity5 , and attracted interest from @entity133 and if @entity137 and @entity149 play well they could join @entity92 through the door ? they will keep @entity149 , and coach @entity109 has said of @entity137 : ' he is very much part of our plans			1
i think he will still be here with us when the window closes			0
' how do they play ? probably 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 with the @entity159 @entity158 and @entity160 in the centre of defefence , @entity163 at right back , and @entity137 as a very attacking left - back			0
@entity165 should start next to @entity166 , the former @entity90 kid signed from @entity168 , and @entity169 , in a line of three behind @entity149			0
do they have a chance ? with fewer players having come back late after playing in the @entity175 they should be fitter than @entity0			0
but when real tire @entity58 will have around 100m euros worth of talent on the bench to freshen things up			0
it will be very difficult			0
stopper : @entity5 goalkeeper @entity134 was in fine form last season , and was exceptional in the final in @entity185 @entity37 focused on the game despite returning ' back home '			1

@entity5 are *notoriously* a selling club , having *cashed* in on the likes of @entity80 , @entity79 , @entity98 and now @entity92
@entity192 side beat @entity44 on penalties in @entity185 in may 's @entity41 final
manager @entity109 has been in charge since *january* 2013
@entity127 striker @entity126 scored 21 goals last season
