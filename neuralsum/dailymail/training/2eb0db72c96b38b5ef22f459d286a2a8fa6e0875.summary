@entity116 of @entity117 , the nephew who gave @entity2 ' artifacts to the museum in 2001 , told her he had received it several years after @entity2 ' death and worried that passing it on to @entity123 might cause problems with her marriage			2

the bloody operation was where @entity31 forces learned the @entity5 had changed their island defense tactics			2

the museum 's curator , @entity200 , said it was the first time in his 17 years of museum work that someone found ' themselves mentioned in an artifact in the museum , ' and he let @entity123 take a closer look at the diary , using white gloves to protect the old papers from skin oils			1
