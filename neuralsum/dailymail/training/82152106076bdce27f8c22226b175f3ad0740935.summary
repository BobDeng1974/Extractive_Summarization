researchers have created a fabric circuit board that could be incorporated into clothing for a number of purposes			1
one of these is the ability to create ‘ smart bulletproof vests ’ that could tell people away from the front line that the person wearing it has been shot			1
and the team who made the fabric circuit board say it can be stretched a million times and washed 30 times with no detrimental effects			1
their material is made by knitting yarn and copper fibres together			1
it can be stretched a million times without breaking the fabric circuit board ( @entity22 ) was created by scientists at the @entity19 in @entity20 reports @entity30			1
it is made of multiple filaments of pre-stretched elastic yarn and polyurethane - coated cobber fibres , which are combined with a knitting machine			2
speaking to @entity38 , research @entity36 explained the @entity22 could be stretched and pulled a million times without it being damaged			1
it could also be washed 30 times with no negative effects			0
‘ to the best of our knowledge , the performance of new @entity22 has far exceeded those of previously reported metal - coated elastomeric films or other organic materials in terms of changes in electrical resistance , stretchability , fatigue life and washing capability as well as permeability , ’ said @entity36			2
she said the features made it particularly useful for the @entity22 to be used in clothing , or ' next - to - skin electronic devices			2
' one of the most interesting features , though , is the ability for the @entity22 to be used in bulletproof vests			2
@entity36 explains they made a ‘ flexible and stretchable fabric sending network , ’ to measure the strain and deformation of a smart bulletproof vest			1
they put some of the @entity22 inside energy - absorbing fabrics such as @entity76 to create the smart vests			1
a bullet was then fired into the vest , and they found that the fabric circuits could register when they had been shot			2
this means that , on the battlefield for example , they could send a signal to a medic when a solider has been hurt			0
in addition they found that the strain of the shot did not destroy the circuits			0
the scientists used the fabric circuit boards with @entity76 to make a smart bulletproof vest ( shown )			1
this could relay a message to a medic when the wearer has been shot teenagers in hoodies are stereotypically portrayed as uncommunicative			1
but this could be about to change after a team of graduate students in june created a hooded sweatshirt that lets the wearer send subtle and covert messages			2
different pre-programmed texts can be sent using a number of gestures , so wearers can tell a friend they 're free to chat or they 're missing them , merely by touching their sleeve			0
the smart sweatshirt was created by students at @entity119 ’s @entity118 ( @entity118 )			0
the prototype hoodie has a @entity122 radio and sensors sewn inside it , allowing the piece of clothing to respond to different gestures			0
‘ the knitted @entity22 have shown excellent reliability during the ballistic impact tests as all the sensor network assembly samples performed well without mechanical and electrical failure and received reliable electrical signals , ’ @entity36 says			0
aside from bulletproof vests , other potential applications for the technology include electric fabric skin for bionic search robots			0
@entity36 also says it could be used in a ‘ smart belt as an intelligent monitoring system for physiological and mechanical signals in sport of weightlifting			0
’ she adds : ‘ practically , knitted @entity22 have great potentials in a wide range of applications , such as human / electronic interfaces , skin - mounted systems , as well as next - to - skin monitoring systems for health care			0
’ this is because the circuits can be deformed in three dimensions and can be bent and moved without breaking			0
speaking to @entity38 , research @entity36 explained the @entity22 ( shown ) could be stretched and pulled one million times without becoming damaged			1
it could also be washed 30 times with no negative effects			0

researchers at the @entity19 in @entity20 have created an advanced fabric circuit board ( @entity22 )
their material is made by knitting yarn and copper fibres together
it can be stretched a million times without breaking
the scientists used it with @entity76 to make a smart bulletproof vest
this could relay a message to a medic when the wearer has been shot
