the @entity0 fears @entity1 is poised to invade @entity2 , but it seems the @entity3 has a bigger conquest in its sights - the @entity6			1
@entity7 today set out plans to conquer and colonise space , including a permanent manned moon base			1
deputy premier @entity11 said : ' we are coming to the moon forever			2
' his comments came as president @entity15 toured the @entity16 in @entity7			1

moon mission : @entity15 ( left ) looks at exhibits as he visits the @entity16 in @entity1			1
currently , @entity1 has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade president @entity15 was taking the tour as one of his deputy premiers , @entity11 , claimed that @entity1 had an eye on the @entity6 once again the @entity1 president enjoyed the visit while with a group of children			1
currently @entity1 has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - byt he end of the decade the final frontier : a @entity1 @entity41 rocket takes off for the @entity42 last month			2
the @entity3 has announced plans to o build a super-heavy carrier rocket that will propel its cosmonauts to @entity46 in an article in the government 's own newspaper headlined ' @entity51 ' , he spoke of targeting @entity46 and other ' space objects ' as future priorities			1
' flights to @entity46 and asteroids in our view do not contradict exploration of the moon , but in many senses imply this process			0
' he wrote of ' colonisation of the moon and near - moon space '			1
in the next 50 years , manned flights are unlikely beyond ' the space between @entity68 and @entity46 '			0
' we are coming to the moon forever ' : @entity1 deputy pm @entity11 first outlined his country 's plans for lunar exploration and colonisation last month but ' it is quite possible to speak about exploration of @entity46 , flights to asteroids and flights to @entity46 '			1
the essential first step as a base for research and experiments was the moon , said @entity11 , who is in overall charge of @entity1 's space and defence industries , and was recently targeted for @entity88 and @entity90 sanctions over the @entity2 crisis			1
' the moon is not an intermediate point in the race , ' he wrote in official daily @entity95 , conjuring an impression of a new space race with @entity90			2
' it is a separate , even a self - contained goal			0
' it would hardly be rational to make some ten or 20 flights to the moon , and then wind it all up and fly to the @entity46 or some asteroids			0
' this process has the beginning , but has no end			0
we are coming to the moon forever			0
' currently , @entity1 has plans to launch three lunar spacecraft - two to the surface and one to orbit - by the end of the decade			2
the first mission , the long - delayed @entity115 - 25 , is slated for launch in 2016 , to research the moon 's south pole			1
the next two missions will include an orbiter to monitor the moon in 2018 , and a year later a polar lander with a drill will search for water ice			2
the @entity3 's space - age boasts come less than three years after the @entity90 was forced to start hitching flights on @entity1 rockets			1
@entity128 ended its space shuttle programme in 2011 and has faced years of funding cuts			0
just two weeks ago a @entity41 rocket carried two @entity1 cosmonauts and a @entity90 astronaut to the @entity42 ( above ) , despite the crisis in @entity135			0
but there could be hope of a new space race - as @entity128 announced this week it hopes to land humans on @entity46 within 20 years			2
by 2040 , @entity1 plans to create a lunar base for long - term missions to the @entity143 's natural satellite			1
@entity11 said that the moon is the only realistic source to obtain water , minerals and other resources for future space missions			1
a lunar laboratory complex will also be used for testing new space technologies			0
he promised the development of ' a super-heavy rocket for lunar missions and to the @entity46 in the future '			0
@entity11 claimed sanctions including the termination of space cooperation announced by the @entity90 ' can contribute ' to a stronger @entity1 space industry			2
it will force @entity1 ' to create a strategy of development of @entity1 manned space flights , independent from unreliable international partners '			0
he stressed : ' we should not be afraid to dream , to raise the bar as high as possible for our future development			0
' @entity1 has everything needed for a new breakthrough in space research			0
' all we need is to learn how to combine idealism and pragmatism and how to properly organise our business			0
' surface area : 6.6million square miles population : 144million maximum temperature : @entity177 minimum temperature : @entity179 surface area : 14.6million square miles population : 0 ( that we know of ) maximum temperature : @entity183 minimum temperature : @entity185			0

deputy pm says moon is only realistic source of minerals and resources
first mission to launch in 2016 and ' base will be up and running by 2040 '
