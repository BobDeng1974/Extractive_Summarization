a nasty showdown erupted on the set of @entity2 last thursday when the show 's moderator @entity3 and co-host @entity5 got into a heated spat in front of the studio audience			1
@entity5 was upset because @entity3 cut her off on a ' @entity10 ' subject that @entity5 indicated she was passionate about backstage before the show			1
the segment ran out of time and @entity3 had to cut to a commercial , a show insider tells @entity16 exclusively			2
the ' @entity10 ' was on spanking and the segment was running long , so producers told @entity3 it was time to go to commercial break in her ear			2
@entity5 refuses to wear an isd monitor in her ear so the control room is unable to speak to her			0
show sources say there 's no love lost between the co-hosts @entity3 told her that if she had an ear monitor , she would have known what was going on			1
when @entity3 did the abrupt cut to commercial , when @entity5 let loose , the insider said			1
' as soon as they went to commercial break , @entity5 took the handheld microphone that they use to engage the audience , ' explains the tipster			0
' instead of talking to the crowd , @entity5 spoke directly to @entity3 in the mic that she " hurt my feelings , " and that she was " very upset by it " and " did n't appreciate " what @entity3 had done			1
' standing to the side without a microphone , @entity3 responded by saying : ' this is n't the time for this , @entity5			1
' instead of moving on , @entity5 continued to gripe openly in front of the audience in the microphone about what she perceived as an on - air snub			1
' well i just do n't appreciate you saying that you were going to do something and not doing it			0
it makes me upset and i just do n't want to have to go through this , ' @entity5 continued			2
@entity3 , looking annoyed , shot back : ' i said this was not the time @entity5			2
' not phased by the @entity69 winner 's petition to leave matters alone until after the show , the 52 - year - old comedienne continued to vent about @entity3 's actions			1
@entity2 moderator then fired back to @entity5 : ' f * * * it , i told you to leave it alone and you just do n't want to listen			1
if you want to go there @entity5 , i will dammit			0
i 'm really sick of your s * * * ! ' a hush fell over the studio			0
love you , mean it ? @entity5 and newbies @entity83 ( left of @entity5 ) and @entity85 put their hands together for returning @entity3 in the season premier			2
but show insiders say @entity5 wants to rule the roost as moderator ' at this point , you could 've heard a pin drop			2
it was like everything came to a standstill and @entity5 finally backed down , ' the source explained			0
new co-host @entity83 then jumped up and made light of the moment , ending the quiet that had fallen over the room			0
' oh s * * * , @entity103 is going to be off the hook now , ' @entity102 quipped , causing the crowd to laugh			0
' they 're about to get it , ' she continued			0
producers hurried over to the two ladies with notes and information regarding the next segment and when the show returned live , it was as though nothing had gone wrong			0
relations between @entity5 and @entity3 behind the scenes at @entity2 have been tense since the beginning of the season , as sources believe that @entity5 really wants to be in her old moderator role and is having a hard time playing second fiddle to @entity3			1
additionally , @entity3 has begged @entity125 to terminate her contract with the network and pay her the remaining $ 10 million on her deal to go home , as she hates working on the show now , particularly with all of the changes			0
kiss and make up : after @entity5 and @entity3 's heated exchange , ' you could 've heard a pin drop , ' said a show insider			1
' it was like everything came to a standstill and @entity5 finally backed down , ' the source explained sources at @entity2 tell @entity16 that @entity5 has been a terror from the get - go , only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts ; @entity3 and newcomers @entity83 and @entity85 , to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot , she 's literally running the show			1
' she has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line , ' said a show insider			0
when @entity5 and new co-host @entity153 did a test show with two fill - in hosts in an effort to build chemistry			2
neither @entity83 or @entity3 were present			0
despite the fact that @entity3 is the regular moderator for the show , leading the discussion , @entity5 took charge of the test show with @entity153			1
' it was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator			0
it 's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before , ' offered the source			0
keeping her dukes up : perhaps @entity3 was explaining the confrontation as she left @entity125 's studio on monday nice shoes : the comedienne was wearing colourful strapped flat shoes as she got ready to head home a whole lotta @entity5 problems : no doubt working with the roly poly comic is one of the reasons the jolly star was looking so grumpy			1

@entity5 took the mic and aired her *grievances* with @entity3 about her ' on - air snub '
@entity3 *warned* @entity5 to leave it alone - but she would n't
even before @entity2 *debuted* , @entity5 let everyone know she 's top dog even though @entity3 is the official moderator of the show
@entity3 told her , ' i 'm moderating and that 's how it 's going to be , so work with me babe !
