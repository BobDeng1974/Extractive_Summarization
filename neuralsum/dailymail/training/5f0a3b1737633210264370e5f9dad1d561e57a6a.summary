@entity10 , 47 , was earlier reported to have been arrested after being on the run following the discovery of the body of a naked woman under a bed with her throat slashed in another cheap hotel in @entity27			1
but in a dramatic development today , police said the foreign national found dead in a cheap flop house - doss house - was believed ' 70 to 80 per cent ' to be that of @entity10 from @entity33 , @entity34			1
municipal police official @entity35 told the @entity36 that the body was found without identification in the lodgings in @entity27 's @entity41 district			1
he had apparently smashed a window , then used a shard of glass to cut his own throat - a macabre replay of the savage death of the young woman whose throat had been cut and who had suffered other stabbing injuries around her neck			1
mr @entity53 said police were reasonably certain that the dead man was @entity10 , but no passport or other identity papers were found in the room			2
' the dead foreigner , we suspect 70 to 80 per cent , that it is @entity10 , ' he said			2
police said the dead man was believed to be ' a little over 30 years of age ' which would make him much younger than @entity10 's 47 years			2
the owner of the lodging house told local media that the @entity6 man had taken up occupancy of room 304 on the second floor at 3am on january 5 after a friend of his , who was not staying there , had rented the room for him			0
on the morning of january 6 , local media reported , the guesthouse owner and cleaning staff became worried that they had not seen the man emerge from his room the day after he had checked in			0
when they went to the room , they found the door bolted and a mattress had been stood up against the keyhole to prevent anyone looking in			0
murder probe : the naked body of the young woman was found under the bed with her throat slashed inside the £ 12 - a - night @entity90 in @entity27 ( above ) the owner forced his way in and found the foreign man lying on the bed			1
it is not known who the friend is who checked the man into the room			0
@entity10 had originally checked into the £ 12 - a - night @entity90 in @entity27 with a woman - believed to be a prostitute known as @entity13 , although she has yet to be formally identified - on christmas day			1
late at night on december 28 @entity10 came down from his room to the reception desk and asked for the return of his passport - customarily kept until the bill was paid - because he needed it to draw money from a bank			0
even though no banks were open at that time of night , about 11pm , the passport was returned and @entity10 walked out , never to return			0
trail of clues : @entity10 had originally checked into the @entity90 ( above ) with a woman - believed to be a prostitute known as @entity13 - on christmas day the following day the naked body of the young woman was found under the bed with her throat cut			1
police began a search for @entity10 in the city and ordered border posts to watch for him in case he tried to leave the country			0
earlier this week , a writer on an expatriatre forum insisted that @entity10 had been arrested and later gave details that police had picked him up at a local market			2
the writer said @entity10 , who always wore sunglasses , had been seen several times in the city - particularly near the market - since the discovery of the woman 's body and he was surprised that he had been able to move around so freely			0
if @entity10 was not arrested , but had cause to suspect police were closing in on him , it might explain his arrival at a flop house in the early hours of the morning , expatriates speculated today			1
@entity10 , who was said to have overstayed his visa and was desperately short of cash , was also described as being hooked on crystal meth as was the woman he was suspected of murdering			0
the @entity19 @entity146 said it was not able to comment and police said they were still trying to confirm the identity of the dead man .			0

@entity10 , from @entity34 , was *initially* reported to have been arrested

believed he smashed window and used shard of glass to cut his own neck
