the @entity0 on monday proposed listing the @entity2 lion as threatened after a study showed the big cats were in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future			1
a listing as threatened under the @entity10 @entity9 would bar trafficking of the species as it faces dwindling habitat in @entity2 and more competition with humans			1
african lions , or @entity18 , are found across a wide range in the continent , but about 70 percent , or 24,000 , of them live in only 10 major strongholds , the service said in a statement			2
the @entity0 is proposing to list the @entity2 lion as a vulnerable species in order to stave off what it called the species ' decline into extinction in the ' foreseeable future ' experts estimate there are around 35,000 lions left in the wild			1
in 1980 , that number was closer to 80,000			1
one major problem lions face is the rapid decimation of their food animals to feed humans			2
as they lose prey , they turn to livestock			0
humans in turn kill the lions that prey on their livestock			2
listing lions as vulnerable would bar trafficking of the species the @entity10 or by @entity10			1
listing the @entity2 lion as threatened ' will bring the full protections of @entity10 law to lion conservation , allowing us to strengthen enforcement and monitoring of imports and international trade , ' @entity0 director @entity60 said			1
the main threats to the @entity2 lion are loss of habitat and of the animals lions prey on , and increased conflict with humans , the statement said			0
people and farming and grazing activities have expanded into lion habitat and protected areas , putting more livestock near the big cats			0
as hunters reduce the number of animals that lions feed on , lions kill more livestock , leading to retaliatory killings by humans			0
the @entity0 is also proposing a rule that would set up permits for the importation of sport - hunted lion trophies			1
sport - hunting is not seen as a threat to the species , the statement said			0
the @entity9 bars such activities as import , export , commercial activity , interstate commerce and foreign commerce			0
it also heightens awareness of listed species and can provide financial aid to efforts to conserve them			0
the proposal to list the @entity2 lion as threatened follows a 2011 petition from a coalition of organizations			0
the @entity0 is seeking public comments for 90 days on its proposal			1

the move would *ban* unwarranted killing of lions in the @entity10 and by any @entity10 *citizen* outside the @entity10
only about 35,000 *remain* in the wild *versus* 80,000 in 1980
the @entity0 is seeking public comments for 90 days on its proposal
