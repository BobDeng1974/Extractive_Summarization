gay rights issues have divided @entity34 in recent months as president @entity82 has pushed through a bill to legalise gay marriage despite angry street protests			0
the law , backed by two in three people in surveys , is set to pass without major hitches in a parliament where @entity82 's socialists have a majority			1

' what ( the anti-gay marriage campaign ) are saying is that they 're not homophobic : lesbians and gays are nice people , but do n't let them get close to children - that 's very dangerous			1
it 's ok for them to live together , but not like other couples with the same protection because it 's not really the same thing			1
