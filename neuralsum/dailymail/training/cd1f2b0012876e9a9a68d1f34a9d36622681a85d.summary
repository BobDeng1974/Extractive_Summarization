click here to read @entity2 's report from @entity3			0
the first rule of being a @entity6 player is to show pride and honour			1
the second is to give it everything you have got			0
on both levels this @entity6 team let down their club at @entity3 on sunday afternoon			2
they have gone , lost their fight , their desire and hunger to win matches after coming within two points of winning the @entity25 title last season			1
in the dugout , soaked through to the skin , @entity6 manager @entity37 is trying to work out where it has all gone wrong			1
there is no cohesion and the fabric of the team , established by the hard work and goals of @entity57 , has been ripped out of them			0
it was only a couple of weeks ago when @entity37 admitted he was under pressure to find the answers			2
so far , this @entity6 team has come up short			2
palace midfielder @entity65 ( second from left ) celebrates passionately after scoring a free - kick @entity32 ( left ) and @entity68 prepare to take kick - off after @entity33 's equaliser on sunday they are no longer playing for each other and the spirit engendered last season , when they ran champions @entity75 so close , has evaporated			1
the legs have gone and there are long faces all round			0
at the final whistle , after they had surrendered a one - goal lead , they did n't even look bothered to be beaten again			2
there is something seriously wrong at @entity86 and over the next few days @entity37 will have to come up with some answers because this boil had to be lanced			0
@entity37 has a heap of problems , with @entity6 only winning twice in the league since august @entity28 walks off following a disappointing performance at @entity3 on sunday @entity28 , @entity93 and @entity94 line up in the defensive wall as they face a free - kick @entity33 manager @entity98 celebrates his side 's third goal by @entity65 during the 3 - 1 home win it can not all be about @entity57 , the man who scored 31 times in the @entity25 last season , because they spent all the £ 75million and then some on his replacements			1
two of them - @entity109 and @entity32 - combined to put @entity6 ahead just 94 seconds into this incredible afternoon at @entity3			1
after that @entity6 collapsed and @entity33 rubbed their faces in the dirt when @entity65 scored with a beaut of a free - kick from 25 yards to make it 3 - 1			1
@entity65 steps up to deliver the killer blow to @entity6 as the visitors lost 3 - 1 at @entity33 @entity6 sold @entity57 to @entity117 for £ 75million in the summer the @entity25 table the problem for @entity37 is that he has spent the two - week international break , when most of his players have been away , trying to work it all out			1
here they were back to the beginning , perhaps back to the time when @entity37 took over a team that reached the @entity129 and @entity130 finals under @entity131			0
the word transition has been used , but this club went too deep into the @entity25 title race for that to be bandied around @entity86			0
these @entity6 players are letting their supporters down , because you can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times the team has chucked it in			0
here they did just that , paralysed by fear and anxiety after @entity147 equalised for @entity33 in the first half			0
after that , @entity6 's collapse here at @entity3 was n't spectacular			0
the injured @entity152 spent saturday night watching the boxing at @entity6 's @entity154 last season 's 3 - 3 draw , in which @entity6 surrendered a three - goal lead , became known as ' @entity158 ' - here , @entity31 consoles @entity57 at the final whistle back in may @entity162 shoulders blame for defeat			1

@entity6 lost 3 - 1 to @entity33 after taking the lead in south @entity41
the @entity167 are 12th in the @entity25 and *18* points behind @entity169
@entity37 ' side are lacking cohesion and spirit this season
