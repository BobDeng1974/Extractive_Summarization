plan : president @entity29 is prepared to go ahead with a limited airstrike on @entity4 despite last night ¿ s rejection of military action by @entity32 , according to senior @entity1 administration officials the declassified report does not contain a smoking gun directly linking @entity5 to the massacre that killed at least 350 people last week , officials said			1
@entity1 satellites have captured images of @entity4 troops moving trucks into weapons storage areas and removing materials , but analysts have not been able to track what was moved or , in some cases , where it was relocated			2
this means a possible series of @entity1 cruise missile strikes aimed at crippling @entity5 ’s military infrastructure could hit newly hidden supplies of chemical weapons , accidentally triggering another attack			1
the @entity1 also intercepted a phone call in which @entity4 military officials discussed the strike , but the staff were only low - level , the officials said			2
