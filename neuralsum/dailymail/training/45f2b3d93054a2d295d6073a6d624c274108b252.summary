by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 13 may 2012 updated : 03:25 est , 14 may 2012 @entity2 cabinet ministers warned @entity4 colleagues yesterday that gay marriage and @entity6 can not be priorities , amid growing signs that senior coalition partners are flexing their muscles in the wake of poor local election results			1
defence secretary @entity13 - increasingly tipped as a future chancellor - became the most senior member of the government to suggest plans to allow gay couples to marry should be shelved			2
and he echoed @entity20 ’s warning last week that the @entity21 must not become ‘ bogged down ’ on @entity23 reform , saying it should only proceed if legislation can go through @entity25 relatively easily			0
bigger priorities : both @entity13 and @entity27 have called on the government to ' prioritise ' @entity2 chairman @entity27 also said lords reform was not a priority , saying not one voter had raised the issue on the doorstep with her in the last six months			1
mr @entity13 told the @entity36 ’s @entity35 programme that proposals to legalise gay marriage should be delayed to ensure ministers focus on ‘ the things that matter ’			1
he said : ‘ clearly it ’s not the number one priority			2
if you stop people in the street and ask them what their concerns are , they ’ll talk to you about jobs and economic growth , they ’ll talk to you about the level of the wages they ’re earning , wanting to see real growth in wages again			0
‘ the government has got to show over the next couple of years that it is focused on the things that matter to the people in this country - not just the short - term things but the long - term things as well : the reform of our education system , changing the welfare system - which is like turning around a super-tanker - changing the welfare system so that work always pays and people have an incentive to work			0
’ opposed : @entity73 , the children 's minister , wrote to a constituent to say he was opposed to gay marriage mr @entity13 ’s comments came after @entity73 , the children ’s minister , wrote to a constituent to say he was opposed to gay marriage			1
‘ marriage as a religious institution can not be anything other than between a man and a woman			2
' i do not see why we need to change the law , especially at this time when there are so many other important matters for the government to be addressing , ’ mr @entity73 wrote			1
a poll yesterday showed strong support for gay marriage among women , with 53 per cent supporting it and 30 per cent opposed			1
the gap is narrower among men , though they still back the idea by 48 per cent to 39 per cent			0
the issue divides the generations , however , with over 60s more likely to be opposed			0
local government secretary @entity103 yesterday gave his backing to gay marriage , urging colleagues not to get themselves ‘ hot under the collar ’			1
‘ we ’re still out to consultation			0
it was never intended that we would legislate this year , ’ mr @entity103 told the @entity36 ’s @entity109 programme			1
‘ it just seems to me to be a question of good manners and if you ’ve got something like civil partnership , which are for all practical purposes a marriage , let ’s drop the hypocrisy and go all the way			2
’ mr @entity20 recently said : ‘ i ask myself the question , ‘ why is it that we deny gay couples the ability to get married ? ’ and , i do n’t think that ’s right			2
‘ obviously this is a controversial issue			0
i feel the time for change has come			0
if you ask , particularly young people , they say this feels like a very natural change to make			0
we are not changing what happens in church			0
’ voters have until next month to submit their views on the gay marriage proposals , championed by @entity4 equalities minister @entity139 and backed by mr @entity20 .			1
