a nanny caring for a baby who was having a good old cry before settling down for her afternoon nap got the shock of her life when the police showed up following a complaint			1
@entity8 says that when she got home from work this past august she was terrified when her nanny informed her that a mother at the playground had called the police on her			1
little did she know just why police were called			0
over the line : @entity8 ( above with daughter @entity17 ) was shocked to learn a @entity19 mother called the police on her nanny because her baby was crying ' i heard the word " police , " and got really nervous , ' @entity22 , a lawyer , told @entity26			1
' but after my nanny @entity27 explained the situation to me , my worry turned to anger and disbelief			2
' @entity17 , the young child in question , often would take her afternoon nap in her stroller , and it being summer she and @entity27 were at the park when she went down for her nap			2
and , like almost every other toddler and child being out down for a nap , @entity17 began to cry - loudly			2
' my daughter has a strong set of lungs , and she sometimes cries when she ’s put down to nap , as i imagine many kids do , ' said			0
' since we did sleep training with her when she was very young , we ’re fine with that — as @entity27 knows			0
' taking it too far : @entity8 ( with her husband and @entity17 ) explained that her daughter usually takes her afternoon nap in her stroller , and often cries a local mother was not fine with this however , and went over to @entity27 to ask why the baby was crying			1
after @entity27 explained the woman walked off , accusing her of neglect , and called the police			2
unfortunately for the angry woman , by the time police arrived , @entity17 was asleep and they were confused as to why they had been called in			1
feeling bad for @entity27 , and upset , @entity8 then did what many mother in @entity19 do , writing about what happened her neighborhood listserv			1
' as i told our nanny , if she had let my daughter crawl / play around unsupervised , i would obviously have a serious problem and would appreciate someone looking out for my daughter ’s safety , ' she wrote			0
' but the fact that she let her cry before a nap is totally par for the course and in my mind does not constitute anything close to neglect			0
( if you think it does , you should call the cops on me , too			0
) ' happy girl : @entity8 ( with @entity17 ) then wrote on a local listserv about the incident , saying to call the police was inappropriate ' while i appreciate that parents in the neighborhood are keeping a watchful eye while some of us are working , let ’s remember that getting the police involved is a serious decision and one that should be reserved for obvious cases of neglect / abuse , not merely situations that exemplify child - rearing styles different than one ’s own			1
' lucky for @entity8 , almost everyone seemed to agree with her			0
wrote one father , ' in a world of internet intemperance and incendiary outbursts , you have written a response to provocation that is a model of sanity and reason			0

@entity8 says that her nanny @entity27 had a woman call the police on her while she was caring for @entity8 *'s* toddler @entity17
@entity17 was crying before going down for a nap at the local playground in @entity19 , @entity117 , so the mother accused @entity27 of neglect
the police filed no charges as the baby was fine and asleep when they arrived on the *scene*
@entity8 was so upset she wrote on her local neighborhood listserv about the incident
