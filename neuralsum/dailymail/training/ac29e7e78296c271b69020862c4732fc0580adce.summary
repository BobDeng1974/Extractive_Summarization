by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 13 june 2013 older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent volunteering for the @entity5 or helping out at a charity shop could save your life by reducing your blood pressure , according to new research			1
older people who carry out at least 200 hours of voluntary work a year - which equates to 25 days of eight hours - reduce their risk of high blood pressure by 40 per cent			1
the condition , known medically as hypertension , is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease - @entity21 ’s biggest killer			1
a study last week found about a quarter of over 60s in the @entity21 regularly help the @entity5 , the @entity24 and other such organisations , more than any other age group			2
the researchers believe the reason these activities improve blood pressure could be that people who devote their time to others enjoy more friendships and social connections than they would otherwise			2
professor @entity36 , of @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , said : ‘ as people get older , social transitions like retirement , bereavement and the departure of children from the home often leave older adults with fewer natural opportunities for social interaction			0
‘ participating in volunteer activities may provide older adults with social connections they might not have otherwise			0
there is strong evidence that having good social connections promotes healthy ageing and reduces risk for a number of negative health outcomes			0
’ the study , published by the @entity62 ’s @entity61 journal , says voluntary work may be an effective way of preventing high blood pressure without the use of drugs			1
every year high blood pressure leads to more than seven million premature deaths across the globe through heart disease and stroke			1
in the @entity21 there are estimated to be about 62,000 unnecessary deaths a year from stroke and heart problems because of poor blood pressure control			2
for the study 1,164 participants aged 51 to 91 from across the @entity79 were recruited and asked about any voluntary work , as well as various social and psychological factors			2
at the first interview in 2006 all had normal blood pressure levels but when measured again in 2010 , those who had been doing 200 hours or more a year for charity were 40 per cent less likely to have developed hypertension			0
the condition , known medically as hypertension , is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease - @entity21 's biggest killer the researchers said the specific type of activity was not a factor the important thing was the amount of time spent			1
psychologist @entity101 , who led the research , said : ‘ @entity103 , we are learning more about how negative lifestyle factors like poor diet and lack of exercise increase hypertension risk			0
‘ here , we wanted to determine if a positive lifestyle factor like volunteer work could actually reduce disease risk			0
‘ and , the results give older adults an example of something that they can actively do to remain healthy and age successfully			0

high blood pressure is one of the main causes of stroke and heart disease
a quarter of over 60s in the @entity21 regularly *undertake* voluntary work
this activity improves health by creating friendships and social links
