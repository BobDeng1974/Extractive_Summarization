but the @entity6 division of @entity8 potato chip maker @entity9 ( owner of @entity11 in the @entity12 ) is banking on tastes in the @entity14 being far more adventurous			1
the @entity15 and chicken is just one of the bizarre flavours they have introduced to tempt increasingly affluent easterners into picking up a pack			1
weird : pizza and chips flavoured crisps ( left ) are just some of the bizarre flavours which are being bought others marketed by the global brand - which incidentally also owns @entity15 - include @entity26 and @entity27 , @entity29 soup and the comparatively normal sounding @entity30			1
other firms , not to be outdone , are producing flavours including @entity33 ( a @entity35 dish made of fermented vegetables ) , @entity37 and even @entity38 ( together , on one crisp )			0
as the world 's fastest growing major economy , with growth rates averaging 10 per cent over the past three decades , @entity6 is a market any company that cares about its future is keen to crack			0
bizarre : numb and @entity27 flavour ( left ) and sour fish soup flavour ( right ) are popular in @entity6 the @entity49 's junk - food giants are no exception and they have come up with a range of adaptations to their popular but generally unhealthy snacks to appeal to the eastern palate			2
cultural differences , it has often been noted , do make @entity6 tastes seem odd to those of us in the @entity49			0
but can that explain the apparent gap in the market one manufacturer has found for chicken and pizza wing flavour ? @entity65 himself would be proud of these concoctions including cheese lobster and kimchi tickle your taste buds : @entity72 ( left ) and pork ( right ) are just some of the flavours being bought @entity75 , which tested out the bizarre flavour , describes it as a ' gangbang of sodium , corn syrup , and other chemicals ' with the texture of ' stale @entity84 's fries '			1
the blog 's food editor selected what he sees as the eight wierdest			0
@entity15 and chicken , he said , actually succeeded in pairing the cinnamon sweetness of @entity15 with the the pang of a real roast			2
cheese and lobster was more hit and miss. @entity75 says the flavour ' invokes listening to a toddler bang on the piano ; once in a while you think you 're picking up some semblance of a melody , but it could be your imagination			0
