@entity1 boss @entity0 would welcome @entity2 to the @entity3 - after being assured he is not coming to take his job			1
the 47 - year - old @entity5 has been tipped to make the move to @entity7 next season after confirming earlier this week that he will leave current club @entity10 after seven years at the end of the season			1
that news has sparked a frenzy of speculation over possible destinations with @entity17 having already indicated he is not in their sights with pressure mounting on @entity21			1
@entity0 admits he has no idea where @entity2 will end up - but knows it will not be at @entity24			1
@entity0 insists that @entity2 is not coming to @entity24 to take his job the @entity25 displayed his usual range of emotions ahead of @entity1 's game with @entity29 click here to read 10 key questions ahead of the crunch clash between @entity1 and @entity29 he said : ' he 's a very good coach , but i have no idea if he comes to the @entity3			1
he 's a very good coach , he 's a good friend , i like him very much			2
' if he comes , welcome			2
but i do n't want to get into that story , ' where is he going ? ' ' the only thing i know is that he told me he 's not coming to @entity1 , for sure - and he told me that personally , so , i 'm calm			1
' @entity38 boss @entity37 forecast that @entity2 's pedigree in @entity41 competition would work in his favour for clubs looking to compete on the biggest stage			1
he said : ' a lot of foreign coaches want to come to the @entity3 - it is very attractive to them			0
he is a big character and personality it seems			0
' i do n't know the guy personally as i have n't met him , but he has had a good record apart from this year , where he has had a real struggle			0
' maybe that suggests the way he works works for a certain period			0
but he has had to obviously handle the loss of key players in his time , because that is what happens in @entity5 invariably - @entity66 come and take your better players , strengthening themselves and weakening you as an opponent - so he has had to manage through that			2
@entity72 veteran @entity71 ( right ) takes on @entity73 during training @entity75 continues to wear his protective mask ahead of the visit of @entity29 new signing @entity78 shields the ball from @entity82 defender @entity81 @entity83 leaves @entity84 trailing in his wake as the @entity72 head towards the league title ' but he has had great success in @entity88 and the top clubs , i 'm certain , will be looking at him because that is what they want - people who have had @entity96 experience and who have done well in that competition			0
' that seems to be a pre-requisite before they even start discussing who might come and go			0
' however , @entity104 manager @entity103 admitted the arrival of big - name coaches in the @entity3 simply increases the challenge for home - grown bosses			0
@entity2 has announced that he will leave @entity10 at the end of the season the highly rated coach has been linked with several @entity3 jobs , including @entity17 he said : ' it 's like being a player - we have the best league in the world and the biggest brand in the world , so that attracts the biggest coaches and the biggest players			1
' we have to live with that , we have to be so good			0
not only as a player today , but also as a manager and a coach , you have to embrace that challenge			0
we are faced with that challenge and have to meet it head on			0
' i 'm not surprised if there is a lot of interest around him , if that is what he said , but he has not had quite as good a season [ at @entity10 ] as a couple of seasons ago , so perhaps that is why he is jumping ship and going somewhere else , as he sees he can not go any further where he is , where he has done a fantastic job			1
' @entity103 has complained the the arrival of foreign coaches limits homegrown opportunities @entity151 defender @entity150 has backed @entity2 to be a success in the @entity3 meanwhile , @entity2 's compatriot and @entity151 defender @entity150 admitted surprise at his decision to leave @entity10 , but backed him to be a success in @entity7			1
@entity150 said : ' i 've got some nice experiences in the @entity3 and of course it would be nice if a @entity5 coach would take the challenge of working in the @entity3			2
' it 's not so good for @entity10 that he is leaving , but i still wish him all the best and hopefully one day he will manage abroad			2
i think his passion would fit and to see him in @entity7 would be very interesting			0
' everyone has their philosophy and i think @entity2 has proved that he 's top - level and can teach a lot			2

@entity2 will leave @entity10 at the end of the season
