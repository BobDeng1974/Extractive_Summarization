one of @entity1 's most senior physicists this afternoon announced firm evidence for the existence of the elusive @entity4 , or @entity6 particle			1
although the signal does n't meet strict scientific standards for a ' full scientific discovery ' , it 's still enough for researchers at @entity1 's @entity12 ( @entity12 ) to predict a discovery next year			2
two separate teams of scientists have been running independent experiments in secret from each other in order to improve the veracity of the results with the team leader of one , @entity22 , proclaiming that they believe they 've found signs of the @entity4 in the past year			1
a typical ' candidate event ' for the @entity4 , including two high - energy photons whose energy ( depicted by red towers ) is measured by @entity29			1
the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision size matters : the @entity29 detector weighs a staggering 13,000 tons @entity4 hunters : a graphic showing a collision at full power at the @entity29 detector control room the existence of the @entity4 was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the @entity49 , an invisible force known as the @entity4 formed			1
this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or @entity4 bosons			1
as other particles pass through it , they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the @entity4 will be long term , but they could be felt in fields as diverse as medicine , computing and manufacturing			1
experts compare the search for the @entity4 to the discovery of the electron			1
the idea of the electron – a subatomic particle – was first floated in 1838 , but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years			2
a century on , the electron ’s existence underpins modern science			0
our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients			0
' we have built a solid foundation for the months ahead , ' she said			0
@entity91 particle physicist @entity90 was also upbeat , saying that the results represented ' exciting times ' with ' more to come '			0
professor @entity94 , a particle physicist from the @entity96 , told @entity97 : ' @entity98 and @entity29 [ the two detectors in the hunt for @entity4 ] have presented an important milestone in their search for the @entity4 particle , but it is not yet sufficient for a proper discovery given the amount of data recorded so far			1
' still , i am very excited about it , since the quality of the @entity12 results is exceptional			0
' @entity1 was cautious : ' the main conclusion is that the @entity113 @entity4 , if it exists , is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 116 - 130 @entity116 [ a unit of energy equal to billion electron volts ] by the @entity98 experiment , and 115 - @entity121 by @entity29			1
' tantalising hints have been seen by both experiments in this mass region , but these are not yet strong enough to claim a discovery			0
' @entity4 , if they exist , are very short lived and can decay in many different ways			1
@entity128 relies on observing the particles they decay into rather than the @entity4 itself			1
both @entity98 and @entity29 have analysed several decay channels , and the experiments see small excesses in the low mass region that has not yet been excluded			0
' the upshot of the experiments , therefore , is that researchers believe the @entity4 is fairly lightweight , which could lead to more exciting discoveries , according to @entity141 's @entity140			1
she wrote : ' @entity142 of this mass , about 125 gigaelectronvolts , would blast a path to uncharted terrain			0
such a lightweight would need at least one new type of particle to stabilise it			0
' when looking at results , the scale of certainty used by researchers is the sigma , something peculiar to particle physics			0
researchers need a five - sigma level of certainty to make a bona - fide formal discovery , which means there ’s only a one in a million chance that the result is a statistical error			2
scientists only formally acknowledge an experiment ’s results if they hit a three sigma level , which means there ’s only a 1 in 370 chance of them being a fluke			0
the sigma probabilities announced today for the @entity4 hunt have not been combined , but the overall @entity98 result was 2.3			1
before the press conference began , @entity1 described the room as ' full to the rafters			0
people would hang from the lamps if the security guards would let them '			0
this graphic explains how protons are smashed in the @entity12 the @entity4 is regarded – by those who know about such things – as the key to understanding the universe			1
its job is , apparently , to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. without this mass , these particles would zip though the cosmos at the speed of light , unable to bind together to form the atoms that make up everything in the universe , from planets to people			2
the @entity4 ’s existence was predicted in 1964 by @entity202 physicist @entity201			1
but it has eluded previous searchers – so much so that not all scientists believe in its existence			0
the hunt for the @entity4 was one of the @entity12 's major tasks			2
the collider , housed in an 18 - mile tunnel buried deep underground near the @entity214 - @entity213 border , smashes beams of protons – sub-atomic particles – together at close to the speed of light , recreating the conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the @entity49			2
if the physicists ’ theory is correct , a few @entity4 should be created in every trillion collisions , before rapidly decaying			2
this decay would leave behind a ‘ footprint ’ that would show up as a bump in their graphs			0
the @entity29 – or @entity29 – is a 13,000 - ton machine that sits 330 feet underground , while the @entity98 , at 148 feet long and 82 feet high , is the biggest detector ever constructed			2

the @entity4 helps glue the universe together , but it has never been observed - until now
