if all hope for the future of this @entity4 team revolves around @entity5 , perhaps it ’s best if the whole team revolves around him , too			1
@entity7 is a careful man and can be expected to resist the urge to pile greater responsibility on to a 19 - year - old with eight caps			1
he is also an experienced coach with an expert eye which must be telling him that @entity5 is developing at an accelerated rate into an exceptional attacking force			2
@entity7 will cogitate , for sure , but for anyone watching @entity4 toil to a 1 - 0 win against @entity19 at @entity20 on wednesday it was clear the @entity22 starlet is the team ’s most exciting and threatening player			1
flying start : @entity5 has impressed for @entity22 and @entity4 in his fledging career so far with his turbo speed and ability to jink past an opponent in a heartbeat , a brief moment from @entity5 can destroy the most meticulous defensive planning			1
in a world where even ordinary teams are fit and well - drilled , his unpredictability is priceless			0
@entity7 is not blind to this , which is why he fast - tracked @entity5 ahead of the @entity37			2
he also knows he is most lethal when used centrally , which is why he played him in the central role against @entity41 in @entity42			2
if he gets on the ball and jinks instinctively past the first man , he will be attacking the centre halves , in front of goal , able to dart either way going into the penalty box , daring defenders to make the tackle and concede a penalty , or a free - kick in range of goal			2
@entity57 man : @entity5 has become an integral attacking player for his club @entity22 and for @entity4 out wide , he can still wreak havoc , but there is more chance he will run into cover , or be smothered or forced into a corner			1
and the free - kicks he wins out wide are not likely to result in direct efforts on goal			0
he is not only a dribbler			0
he is aware of others and links up with them			0
he can slide a pass			0
sterling in the centre makes sense			0
the big problem is , of course , that it threatens the captain			0
to free @entity5 is to shackle @entity77 , at least to some extent			1
@entity4 can not afford to jettison someone of @entity77 ’s calibre at a time when they are desperately short of players , let alone those of rare quality and experience			1
@entity7 , having made @entity77 his captain , must find a way to keep him in , while making @entity5 more integral			1
the starting point may be the shape which finished the friendly against @entity19 , with @entity5 at the top of a midfield diamond behind two strikers			2
shackled : moving @entity5 to a central role for @entity4 could effect the role of captain @entity77 in the side it will be a system unfamiliar to anyone not from @entity22 but they are intelligent enough to learn if @entity7 puts the right players in the right areas , and he insists finding round pegs for round holes is one of his strengths			1
as it stands , it would be a pick of two from @entity77 , @entity110 and @entity111			2
the most obvious flaw to the plan is the absence of a natural holding midfielder with a defensive instinct , especially if full - backs are expected to provide attacking width			0
@entity7 will watch closely how @entity120 ’s @entity119 develops on loan at @entity122 this season , and if @entity124 is used in this role at @entity126			0
much promise : @entity4 manager @entity7 will want @entity5 to continue his fine progress aside from this , the manager must experiment until he finds the balance			1
there can be no better environment to find a solution than a lame qualifying campaign with safety nets at every turn			0
@entity5 is raw and makes mistakes			2
there was the red card against @entity141 in @entity142 , for instance			0
he will frustrate his manager , his team - mates and fans as he progresses			0
‘ it does n’t always come off but he ’s an exciting player , ’ said @entity77 as everyone else gushed uncontrollably after the @entity19 game			1
this tame campaign is a gift for @entity7			0
it is the perfect place for @entity5 to learn about international football before launching into @entity154 at the age of 21 , and for @entity4 to learn more about him and discover the best way to maximise this special talent .			1
