@entity3 's right - wing political pin - up @entity1 is to reprise her ratings - busting turn on @entity6 for the show 's 40th anniversary special , it is claimed			1
producers have invited the former @entity11 governor and onetime vice-presidential hopeful back to the programme and she has accepted , a source close to mrs @entity1 told @entity15			1
it will give mrs @entity1 , who no longer holds office but is still active on the @entity19 right , a chance to spar with @entity21 , whose uncanny resemblance to the politician was used to lampoon her during the 2008 presidential race			1
so which is which ? @entity1 and @entity21 in 2008			1
the right - wing politician is set to appear once again on @entity6 , where she will have the opportunity to joust with lookalike @entity21			1
( @entity1 is right ) older and wiser ? mrs @entity1 pictured in september last year			1
she no longer holds office but has used her @entity31 - along with her reality tv programs and @entity34 appearances - to keep her name in the mix mrs @entity1 last appeared on @entity6 in 2008 , just two weeks before election day - although on that occasion viewers were disappointed when she did not appear side - by - side with @entity21			1
still , the anticipation of such a moment sent the programme 's ratings soaring to a 14 - year high , with about 17million viewers tuning in for the first half hour			0
a fresh appearance could be a crafty move to boost her national standing			0
mrs @entity1 , who turned 51 on monday , recently fanned speculation that she might seek the @entity19 nomination in 2016			1
she has used her @entity31 - along with her reality television programs and @entity34 appearances - to keep her name in the mix and to pay for travel to campaign rallies with allies			0
however she is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as @entity59 's running mate in 2008			2
just last week her political stock plummetted when she admitted that a rambling and incoherent speech she recently made in @entity62 came after her teleprompter froze			0
the admission came in a freewheeling television segment with host @entity66 in which she also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place			0
' i was asked by a testy reporter while i was promoting my @entity74 show , @entity3 with @entity1 , ' the self - promoting pol told @entity66			2
' i was asked if i were to be interested at all in running for office , maybe the presidency			2
' ' and it 's certainly not newsworthy , ' she added with a shrug and an eye roll , ' for me to have answered , " oh yeah , i 'm interested , yeah			0
next question ? " good sport : mrs @entity1 getting into the vibe on her visit snl appearance			2
she is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as @entity59 's running mate in 2008 but she had been forced to recover from negative headlines when at the @entity88 she flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of odd one - liners , leaving a welcoming audience confused			1
' did the teleprompter go down ? did you have trouble with the copy ? ' @entity66 asked her			0
' was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty ? because people have been so critical			0
' @entity1 insisted that ' i do n't read the praise and i do n't read the criticism			2
... i 'm used to teleprompters not working			0
' the @entity6 40th anniversary special is due to be broadcast on february 15 at 8pm et on @entity108 .			0
