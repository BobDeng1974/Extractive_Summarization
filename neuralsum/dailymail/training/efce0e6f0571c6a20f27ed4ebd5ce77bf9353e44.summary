chef : @entity1 of @entity2 has asked for a second kitchen in the couple 's new @entity5 apartment the @entity8 and @entity9 have installed a second kitchen in their new @entity5 apartment , it was revealed yesterday			1
the existing 350 sq ft kitchen , originally designed by princess @entity14 ’s husband , @entity13 , has been refurbished at a reported cost to taxpayers of £ 170,000			1
but @entity17 and @entity9 also wanted a ‘ private , family kitchen ’ in the four - storey , 20 - plus room home			1
the cost of reconfiguring the room from existing office space has also fallen to the public purse , but officials stressed last night that the second kitchen itself , as well as all fixtures and fittings , were paid for by the couple			1
asked whether prince @entity33 might have helped his son pay for the new kitchen , a @entity32 spokesman said : ‘ many young couples when doing up houses seek help from their parents or grandparents			1
there may have been some assistance			0
’ details of the @entity45 ’ domestic arrangements were revealed yesterday in an annual briefing on the @entity48 ’s finances , where it was disclosed that the @entity49 is to receive a generous 5 per cent rise in public funding next year			0
a new deal with the government means the amount of money given to the @entity49 to undertake her public duties and the upkeep of all royal residences is now being taken from a single pot of money known as the @entity61 , which she can spend as she wishes			0
this is drawn from a 15 per cent slice of the profits of the @entity66 , a portfolio of land , holdings and investments worth more than £ 9 billion , that was handed to the @entity71 two centuries ago			1
record profits means the monarch ’s income will increase from £ 36.1 million in 2013/14 to an inflation - busting £ 37.9 million in 2014/15			1
but aides insist the monarchy still offers good value for money – just 56p per person each year , or just over 1p per week			0
‘ we try to get the best value as possible from the public funds entrusted to us , ’ said the @entity49 ’s ‘ money man ’ , @entity82 , sir @entity82			0
inevitably , however , it is how her family spends that money that will come under most scrutiny			2
work in progress : including the removal of asbestos , the final bill will be nearly £ 4.5million , although @entity32 stressed the second kitchen will be paid for by the @entity8 and @entity9 yesterday palace officials confirmed that the total public bill for renovations on @entity94 , the new home of the future king and his wife which takes up more than half of one of the palace ’s wings , had spiralled to more than £ 4 million			1
the @entity48 accounts also revealed that the @entity49 slashed her phone bill in half – to £ 100,000 for the year – after staff renegotiated their mobile phone contract			2
sir @entity82 , in charge of the @entity49 ’s finances , saw his salary rise by a generous £ 10,000 to £ 190,000 , while the @entity49 ’s private secretary , sir @entity109 , was given a £ 9,000 pay hike			1
pay for senior staff had been frozen in recent years			0
adding the cost of removing asbestos from the property takes the bill closer to £ 4.5 million			1
officials said the couple had agreed that the basic cost for the restorations should come from the public purse , but they would pay for anything above that – including curtains , carpets and furniture			2
one aide said : ‘ the @entity45 were actually extremely sensitive to the fact that public funds were being used to pay for a lot of this work			0
they understood that it would be a drain on public expenditure and they wanted to minimise that			2
‘ it is not done out to lavish standards			0
you would be surprised at what an ordinary level the apartment has been done to			2
comfortable , but an ordinary level of furnishing			0
’ it is understood that all works were approved by the @entity49 .			0

existing 350sq ft kitchen refurbished at reported cost to taxpayers of £ 170k
but @entity17 and @entity9 also wanted a second ' private , family kitchen '
