scientists are constantly on the lookout for links between data to try and prove certain theories - but just because two sets of statistics match up , it does n't necessarily mean they 're are closely tied			2
to prove a direct correlation does not always mean causation , a @entity9 student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected statistics			1
these include a correlation between sour cream and motorbike accidents , @entity19 films and swimming pool deaths , and divorce rates and margarine			1
to prove that correlation does not always mean causation , a @entity9 student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected sets of data from the @entity29			1
these include a correlation between sour cream and motorbike accidents , pictured according to the data plotted from the @entity29 , @entity35 's @entity34 site found a link between : the consumption of sour cream , and the number of motorcycle riders killed in accidents			1
the number of people who tripped over their own two feet and died , with civil engineering doctorates awarded in the @entity45 how much beef is bought in the @entity45 , compared to the number of deaths caused by lightning			1
the number of films @entity19 has starred in , versus the number of people who died falling into a swimming pool			1
the amount of cheese purchased , and the revenue generated by golf courses			0
@entity35 is studying for a juris doctorate at @entity9			2
using data from the @entity29 and @entity60 research , @entity35 was able to plot correlations between different subjects			1
each @entity63 consists of a graph that plots the development of both chosen statistics			0
depending on the data , the date range can run from 1999 up to 2012			0
below each graph is a chart that shows the numerical statistics , as well as their source , plus the correlation			0
the closer a correlation is to the number one , the more closely linked the two sets of data are			2
‘ anyone can plainly tell that there ’s not a connection between margarine and marriage , ’ explained @entity35			0
this graph plots the correlation between people who died by falling out of wheelchairs between 1999 and 2005 , and the rising costs of a 16oz bag of potato chips in the @entity45 during the same period			1
the data was taken from the @entity29 and @entity60 research ‘ we saw data , we formed a hypothesis and then we rejected that hypothesis , based on our personal experience with the world			1
the graphs claim there to be a correlation between the films @entity19 , pictured , has been in and deaths , driving accidents and divorce rates that ’s a big deal - and it ’s a part that computers ca n’t do			1
research is about discovery , but only humans can actually make discoveries			0
’ the purpose of the @entity34 site , according to @entity35 , is not to say data is ambiguous and can be interpreted however people want , ' instead it reveals it ’s up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there ’s actually a connection between the variables - or if it ’s a coincidence			1
' ‘ finding causal mechanisms is the key goal in a lot of scientific research because when we find causal mechanisms , we learn that much more about the world around us			0
‘ sometimes , we see connections that we ca n’t explain and it inspires us to search for a potential cause			0
’ a good example of correlations leading to conclusions is the connection between smoking and lung cancer			0
in the early 1900s , incidents of lung cancer were on the rise but no - one really knew why			0
in 1929 , @entity142 physician @entity141 published a paper in which he showed that lung cancer patients were particularly likely to have been smokers			0
that paper led to a body of research in which scientists learnt about the dangers of smoking - but it may never have happened if someone had n’t spotted the links			0
' correlations between two variables could be merely coincidence , or they could be the result of an underlying causal link – and every time we see a correlation , we have the marvellous opportunity to try and figure out which one it is , ' concluded @entity35			2
the purpose of the site , according to @entity35 , is not to say data is ambiguous , ' instead it reveals it 's up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there 's actually a connection between the variables - or if it 's a coincidence			2
' this graph shows a link between @entity19 films and people who died falling into a swimming pool between 2000 and 2009 , there was a link between how many people ate eggs in the @entity45 and the number of drivers killed in non-collision transport accidents			1
the closer a correlation is to the number one , the more closely linked the two sets of data are			2

the @entity34 site was created by @entity9 student @entity35
it plots data from the @entity45 *census* and @entity60 research
@entity35 is also in the process of adding *international* statistics to the site
he created it to prove that correlation does not always mean causation
other correlations include the number of @entity19 films and people who died in swimming pools , and egg consumption with driving accidents
