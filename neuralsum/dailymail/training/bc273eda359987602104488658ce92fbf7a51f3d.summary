you know you are in the most expensive city in the world when a @entity5 hotel sandwich and beer costs you Â£ 33 but @entity7 is not here for the experience of wealth , more the wealth of experience			1
as @entity15 leads out @entity16 in @entity17 on monday night , this 39 - year - old from @entity14 will be contemplating a similar career path			1
@entity7 does not have delusions of grandeur as the parallels with @entity15 are already emerging for the self - effacing manager of @entity23 in @entity17 's @entity24			1
@entity7 was a journeyman midfielder , eight clubs plus another five on loan , and found himself on a steep learning curve coaching @entity28 's @entity27 when the club 's former commercial director @entity29 approached him about a new project he was working on with @entity23 in @entity5			1
gaining experience : former @entity33 midfielder @entity7 is now manager of @entity17 side @entity23 talking tactics : @entity7 , pictured on the @entity23 training field , moved to @entity17 to build his career @entity15 sought to learn his trade as a coach abroad prior to returning to @entity16 and for @entity7 the prospect was too good to turn down			1
' at my age , there are not too many opportunities in @entity16 to manage a club of this stature and pedigree , ' says @entity7			1
' as soon as i met the owner @entity48 and spoke to @entity29 it was clear we had the same philosophy			2
they accepted that i was young and would make mistakes but there was no extra pressure			2
it was better than anything i could have imagined back in the @entity57			2
' like many clubs , @entity23 had lost the connection with their support			1
a club rich in heritage , formed in 1890 and pioneer of the first attempted @entity64 in 1930 , they had lost their way and poor financial decisions led to them being declared bankrupt			2
@entity48 , a @entity67 - born businessman , was already the owner of @entity5 's ice hockey team @entity23 and , sensing an opportunity , bought the football club for one @entity17 franc			1
@entity7 was appointed in june and the season began in july			1
he tried and failed to lure friend @entity72 into following him			2
' @entity72 certainly had something to offer still as a player in my mind but he thought about it and sadly decided it was n't for him but i brought over @entity79 as head of performance and @entity82 from the @entity84 set - up as head of sports science and we got to work			0
despite where we are , there is no big budget			0
it 's about being sensible and thinking of the long - term			0
the young players and staff we inherited have been terrific and everyone has been very responsive			0
' we have breakfast and lunch together and must be one of the fittest teams in the league			0
we beat our rivals @entity102 2 - 1 last month and we missed a penalty in the 91st minute but got the winner in the 93rd			0
' that spirit is rubbing off on the supporters too			0
@entity29 has promoted a ' one community , one club ' campaign borrowed from his experience with @entity28 and the attendance for the @entity102 game was double that of when the two sides last met			1
they plan to give away tickets for 10 @entity17 francs to keep the fans coming			1
' even in @entity5 , not everyone can afford to go to football , ' says @entity29			0
@entity121 to embrace the experience , manager @entity7 is learning @entity124 , lives across the @entity126 border near @entity127 and wakes up every morning to a view of the imperious @entity129			1
' it certainly makes you smile , ' he says			0
' it 's a wonderful environment to play football but i ca n't lose sight of why i 'm here			0
i 'm ambitious and serious about building a career			0
i want to make this a success			0
we 're spreading the word that the club is on its way back			2
' journeyman : @entity7 enjoyed spells with @entity28 and @entity33 in the @entity145 among others @entity7 played for sharp - witted characters such as @entity148 and @entity149 while he counts @entity151 technical director @entity150 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 as people he can trust for advice			1
he has struck up a friendship with @entity17 assistant manager @entity158 and , if all else fails , can turn to @entity23 ice hockey coach @entity159 , a no - nonsense @entity67 who was once accused of biting an opponent 's nose			1
as for calling on @entity15 , he 's happy to admire from afar for now			1
' he 's still held in high regard in @entity17 , ' says @entity7			1
' there is a lot of respect for him			0
for me he has to be a barometer of where i could go			0
i 'm not saying i 'm of that quality yet but he was n't afraid to go abroad first and i think you have to be brave to get where you want to go			2
other @entity173 aspiring coaches should take that route			0
' so will he be cheering on @entity16 on monday ? ' i 'm taking the opportunity to go back to @entity28 for a few days with the wife and kids			2
i 'll probably watch it in the pub , besides it 's a cheaper pint back home			0
