by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 21 november 2013 a letter from an astronaut shows his jealousy of @entity4 after he was not picked to be the first @entity5 to orbit @entity6			1
in october 1961 , @entity7 glumly confided to his mother in a letter that is now up for auction that he and his fellow @entity12 7 astronauts resented @entity4 after he was chosen for the mission			1
within the famously competitive group , @entity4 had emerged as the face of the space program , while @entity7 was reluctant in front of the press			1
@entity7 : in this photo taken july 21 , 1961 , the astronaut is seen next to the space capsule @entity22 , for his departure from @entity24 , @entity25 when he wrote to his mother , @entity7 was still stinging from his @entity22 flight on july 21 , 1961 , that ended with a blown hatch , a sunken space capsule and accusations that the former @entity32 fighter pilot had panicked			1
' the flight crew for the orbital mission has been picked and i 'm not on it , ' he writes in slanting script , each line of blue ink climbing slightly from left to right on the @entity41 letterhead			0
' of course i 've been feeling pretty low for the past few days			0
' all of us are mad because @entity4 was picked			0
but we expressed our views prior to the selection so there is n't much we can do about it but support the flight and the program			2
' the letter is being auctioned online by @entity50 of @entity51 , @entity52 , which got it from @entity7 's brother , @entity54			1
' those original seven @entity12 astronauts were extremely competitive people , ' @entity55 said this week			0
' if one was picked over another , they all thought it should be them			0
it 's that kind of atmosphere ; they all wanted to be first			0
' @entity63 ' @entity62 was the second @entity5 to make a suborbital flight			0
after splashing down in the @entity66 , his craft sank when the hatch blew open prematurely and it filled with water			0
auction : the letter is expected to fetch $ 80,000 when it is sold in @entity52 @entity7 narrowly escaped drowning and insisted until his death in a 1967 @entity73 launch pad fire that he did nothing to cause the hatch to blow			1
@entity4 became the first @entity5 to orbit earth in february 1962 and is the last surviving @entity12 astronaut			0
he did not return calls seeking comment			0
in the oct. 7 letter to his mother @entity82 , @entity7 candidly shares his disappointment at being named a flight controller for the second orbital flight , to be piloted by @entity86			1
@entity86 was replaced by @entity87 because of a heart condition			0
' it 's not a job i want , ' @entity7 writes			2
' i have to do a great deal of the work , i 'll be gone from home a lot and i do n't get any of the credit , but if anything goes wrong , i 'll get a good deal of the blame			0
' @entity7 would later pilot the @entity101 orbital mission			2
there 's a touch of mystery , too			0
before he shares the flight crew information - which he cautions his mother to ' keep it under your hat ' - @entity7 drops a hint that someone may be listening in			1
crew : in this photo taken sept. 25 , 1959 in @entity115 , @entity116 , astronauts stand around models of the @entity118 and nose capsule designed to carry them into space			2
from left are @entity122 , @entity123 , executive of @entity124 , maker of @entity118 , @entity4 , @entity7 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 ' i probably would call you , because it 's been so long since i 've called or written , but i 've got some news i do n't think i should talk about over the phone , ' he writes			2
@entity135 , executive vice president of @entity50 , said the letter offers rare insight into the mind of a driven , talented man			2
he anticipates it could fetch $ 80,000 when the auction closes today ; a letter from @entity143 to his parents about trying out for the space program sold for $ 106,000			1
@entity55 said the letter reveals a side of his brother away from the space program			1
he writes his wife , @entity150 , is ' getting pretty fed up ' with him being away from home so much , and interrupts the letter midway through to take the family bowling			2
' i kind of think that it shows that he was just a normal kind of guy ; that he had deep involvement in the space program but also had a family to take care of , ' he said the letter had been sitting in a drawer and @entity55 said he was selling it to ' keep @entity7 ' memory alive and let people know what kind of man he was			1
' ' another side ' : as well as talking about the space program , @entity7 talks about his life away from the mission			1
