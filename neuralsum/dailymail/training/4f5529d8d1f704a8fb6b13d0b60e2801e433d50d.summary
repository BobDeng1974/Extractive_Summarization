technical support company @entity12 dispatched nearly 40,000 to suspected visa over-stayers as part of a @entity16 campaign			1
the text reads : ‘ message from the @entity16			1
our records show that you may not have leave to remain in the @entity7			2
please contact us on 0844 3754636 to discuss your case			0
’ @entity12 is being paid to send the messages as well as letters to some 60,000 foreign nationals who may still be in @entity7 despite their visas expiring			1
however , the @entity16 faces fresh criticism for its tactics to tackle illegal immigration after more than 100 people complained about being sent text messages saying they had no right to stay in @entity7			1
it has emerged those to receive the messages include a civil rights campaigner who has been in @entity7 since 1966 and an immigration caseworker			1
it comes as @entity16 minister @entity37 signalled that controversial vans telling people to ' go home ' could be used again despite opposition from the @entity42			1
@entity44 mayor @entity43 also backed the vans , claiming they could be useful in persuading people to leave @entity7			2
in the text campaign , the standard message from private contractor @entity12 states : ‘ message from the @entity50 : you are required to leave the @entity7 as you no longer have the right to remain			1
’ they were first sent out last @entity54 holidays and the company also uses phone , email or letter to warn people that @entity50 records suggest they need to leave the country			0
earlier this year the information commissioner launched an investigation into the bizarre tactic , amid complaints that @entity50 held inaccurate and outdated data , in breach of the @entity68			0
now a government source has told the @entity70 that ‘ mistakes have clearly been made ’ about who has been targeted , triggering more than 100 complaints			0
one , @entity74 , is a civil rights campaigner and founded the anti-racism charity @entity76 which has campaigned for justice for @entity78 and @entity79			1
he told the newspaper : ‘ i was absolutely shocked and quite horrified to receive the text			0
i thought it was n’t meant for me			0
‘ i came here with my parents in 1966 , i was born in @entity84 and have always had a @entity7 passport			0
’ controversy : the @entity16 has also faced criticism for the use of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to ' go home ' @entity92 , an accredited immigration adviser at a central @entity44 law firm , also received the message			1
mr @entity92 said : ‘ i came here in 1973 so i was very surprised to receive this message and even found it quite funny			0
‘ but if an elderly @entity100 person received one of these messages they would get very worried			2
@entity12 told me i received the message because i put in an application to the @entity16 recently but it must have been 30 years since i last put one in and i did n’t have a mobile then			1
’ the @entity16 claims only 14 people have been contacted in error			1
meanwhile , fresh coalition divisions emerged over the us of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to ' go home '			2
immigration minister mr @entity37 defended the tactic in a pilot this summer and suggested it could be used again			1
he told @entity117 's @entity116 : ' i do n’t see any problem with saying to people who have no right to be in the @entity7 they ca n’t be here anymore			0
' if it ’s successful we ’ll look at rolling it out , if it ’s not successful , we wo n’t			0
' split : @entity128 immigration minister @entity37 ( left ) suggested the ad vans could be used again but @entity42 @entity130 defended himself from criticism that as a minister at the @entity16 he failed to block the vans @entity42 @entity130 , who was sacked as a home office minister last week , hit back at criticism from those around @entity137 that he failed to stop the vans ever being used			1
he said : ' i was n't told about the vans			2
i was n't copied into the paper that was circulated in the @entity16			2
' now whether that was due to a deliberate political decision or was an administrative oversight , who knows ? ' as an illustration into how stretched you can be in a department , when this controversy broke out i was on the other side of the world , ' he told @entity152			0
' it 's been reported i was on holiday			0
i was in the @entity155 of @entity156 as part of the international comparison of drug policy			0
' the first thing i knew about the poster van is when i was in the lounge of @entity164 airport and logged on to the computer to catch up with the news eight time zones away ... it seems unduly critical to be blamed for not stopping something i did n't know about			0
