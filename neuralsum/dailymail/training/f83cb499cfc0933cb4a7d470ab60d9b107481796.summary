since the @entity1 launched their nude charity calendar 15 years ago , it seems every fireman , nurse and rowing club has got their wobbly bits out for miss june or mr december			1
so the pressure is on these days to make ever yearly planner bigger and better to stand out from the rest			0
the ' hotties ' - a group of soldiers @entity15 who consider themselves veterans of the naked charity calendar - have gone one better this year by launching their 2015 offering in one of the country 's best - known strip clubs			1
the hotties are a group of soldiers wags , they are launching their 2015 calendar at @entity27 this weekend			1
@entity28 , 32 , ( left ) an antiques dealer from the @entity30 , is miss june , while @entity32 , 30 , ( right ) an events stylist from @entity33 , is miss january they have taken over @entity27 in @entity37 's @entity36 tomorrow evening and instead of the usual ladies wrapped around a pole , the 12 women involved in the calendar will be walking their famous curves down a catwalk			2
@entity28 , 32 , is miss june and has been in the calendar for the last three years			2
she believes they are a success because they represent the everywoman @entity28 said : ' we 're all very normal , we come in a range of sizes and all have different careers			0
' in the last couple of years , we have raised more than £ 8,000 for @entity55			0
' we sell them all over , places like @entity58 , some in @entity60 , some in @entity62			2
@entity63 ( left ) , 32 , is a lecturer from @entity33 , @entity64 ( right ) , 23 , is a pa and also from @entity33 ' it 's amazing when people send them to us and we can see how far they have traveled around the world - people get a lot of enjoyment from it			0
' what people like as well is that all of the hotties interact with people on our social media pages , so it 's not celeb - based where you are n't likely to get anything back			1
' all of the money from the event is going towards the @entity77 ' two nominated military charities - soldiering on awards and @entity88			1
@entity63 , @entity32 , @entity64 and @entity28 have all modeled for the @entity77 calendar for the last three years the @entity90 recognises inspirational and outstanding achievements of members of the armed forces			0
medals are given to a range of achievements , like the @entity97 , the @entity98 , the @entity99 and the @entity100			0
@entity27 donated the club for the evening because the @entity102 have been a cause close to his heart after marrying his wife @entity105 , whose own family has been personally affected by war			1
he said : ' it ’s admirable to see what these wives and girlfriends of our serving military men have done to help raise awareness of the charities they support			0
' hosting the 2015 calendar launch party to help bring attention to the @entity119 was the least we could do			2

the ' hotties ' consider themselves veterans of the naked calendar market
