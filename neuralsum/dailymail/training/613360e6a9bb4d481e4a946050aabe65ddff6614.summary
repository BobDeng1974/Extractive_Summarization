the @entity11 mayor – on a six - day tour of @entity9 – found himself being confused with the @entity13 tennis hero @entity12			1
at an event in @entity16 which saw the handing over of petals from the @entity19 to @entity9 athletes , the @entity14 was asked if he was the red - haired @entity21 legend			2
' they know it 's @entity5 , that 's the main thing			2
' perhaps the locals could be forgiven for getting mixed up - mr @entity5 was given a royal welcome as he was shown in to the inner sanctum of relics from @entity47 , a figure believed by @entity49 to be @entity51 's incarnation on earth			1
mr @entity33 explained : ' i have never seen someone allowed in there before			0
it 's only usually @entity57 such as the @entity58			0
' the locals were n't the only ones who were unsure of his role			0
an @entity64 businessman who had his photo taken with mr @entity5 referred to him as ' that guy on the zip line ' , referring to when he got stuck while travelling over @entity68 at the @entity69			1
presentation : @entity5 offered petals , which were part of the @entity73 designed cauldron which burnt throughout the @entity19 and @entity75 in @entity11 centre of attention : mr @entity5 met schoolchildren in @entity32 as part of his visit to @entity9 plan : mr @entity5 wants to use the trip to boost business links with the subcontinent after his visit to the temple he went on a log flume ride which featured a narration of the history of @entity9			1
he then nearly missed a round of interviews after officials sat him down to view a 45 - minute film on @entity94			0
mr @entity5 did take time out to back prime minister @entity96 's stance against a referendum on whether @entity98 should remain a member of the @entity100			1
ambitions : mr @entity5 also wants to sort out issues over student visas while abroad he said mr @entity96 should concentrate on repatriating powers from the @entity100 rather than holding a vote on whether we should remain in the bloc			1
he said the question was not worth considering , because even if the @entity98 did leave @entity110 , we would still have to maintain an enormous staff in @entity112			2
mr @entity5 arrived in @entity32 at the start of the tour which will also take in @entity115 and @entity16 and aims to confront @entity98 visa system problems which limit @entity9 students from coming to the @entity98 to study and to pick up tips on how to develop infrastructure			1
an aside : mr @entity5 's backing for @entity96 over an @entity100 referendum will be one less headache for the prime minister the @entity124 he visited is a sister temple to the @entity126 in north west @entity11			1

mr @entity96 has suggested there could be a referendum on @entity98 ’s relationship with the @entity100 - but only after the eurozone crisis has played out			1
mr @entity5 argued that @entity98 was better off in the @entity100 because it had a seat at the table deciding the rules under which the single market - which is valuable for the @entity98 - operates			1
his surprise intervention comes days after an @entity100 summit collapsed in acrimony after failing to agree on a seven - year budget deal			2
mr @entity96 had argued that there should be no real - term rise in the budget , at a time when member states are having to make tough cuts to public services			2
visitor : mr @entity5 is chased by street vendors at @entity159 in @entity32 , on the first of a six - day tour of @entity9 , where he will be trying to persuade @entity9 businesses to invest in @entity11 tourist : mr @entity5 visits the @entity164 in @entity32 , a sister temple to the @entity126 in @entity11 , on the first of a six - day tour of @entity9 yesterday , foreign secretary @entity166 repeated the government ’s position that now is not the time for an in - out referendum			1

mr @entity5 was asked whether he agreed with the calls during an appearance on @entity179 ’s politics show on @entity181			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s as simple as yes , no , in , out			1
‘ suppose @entity98 voted tomorrow to come out			0
what would actually happen ? in real terms , what would happen is that the @entity187 ’s entire delegation would remain in @entity112			0
charm offensive : the @entity11 mayor meets visitors at @entity159 in @entity32 ‘ @entity192 would remain there , we ’d still have huge numbers of staff trying to monitor what was going on in the community , only we would n’t be able to sit in the @entity198			0
we would n’t have any vote at all			0
now i do n’t think that ’s actually a prospect that ’s likely to appeal			0
’ the mayor said it was better to renegotiate our relationship with @entity110 , so we got a better deal which returned powers to @entity207			0
‘ what you could do , is think of a new arrangement , new areas of the treaty that we did n’t want to participate in any more , ’ he said			0
‘ that is the where people are thinking now			0
‘ with great respect to the sort of in - outers , i do n’t think it does boil down to such a simple question			0
’ all smiles : mr @entity5 arrived on his first overseas mission in @entity32 yesterday on call : mr @entity5 took time out from his @entity9 trip to support prime minister @entity96 's stance on a referendum on whether @entity98 should remain a member of the @entity100 speaking on the @entity181 ’s @entity229 show , foreign secretary @entity166 said the government would offer a referendum on @entity98 ’s membership of the @entity100 after the end of the @entity235 crisis and negotiations on repatriation of powers			1

‘ we ’ve said enormous changes are happening in @entity110 , partly because of the crisis in the eurozone that may change the relationship between the countries of the @entity100			0
we ’ve also said we want to improve our relationship with @entity110			0
‘ of course at the last general election we stood in the conservative party on returning some powers to the @entity98			0
‘ we do believe that sometimes less is more in @entity110 ; that doing less at the @entity110 level is better for this county and for other countries , and what we ’ve said is that when we see how that crisis in the eurozone plays out and when we ’ve tried to improve our relationship with @entity110 , well that will be the time to seek fresh consent from the @entity98 people and the cleanest and clearest way of doing that would be in a referendum			2
‘ but we will spell out our policy for the coming years and for the next general election when the prime minister speaks about these things			2
