lots of people say they 're intolerant to it , but most of them do n't even know what it is			1
that 's what talkshow host @entity7 says is the case in @entity11 , where he says eating gluten is considered worse than @entity13			1
and , at least according to his research , it seems he is right			0
on his late - night show @entity19 , the presenter said : ' i do n't know if it 's just here in @entity23 , but people are very anti-gluten			0
which bothers me , because i 'm very pro pizza			0
' and you ca n't be pro-pizza and anti-gluten			0
he did say he was another non-gluten - eating @entity11 resident though @entity7 said he suspected some people do n't eat gluten because ' someone in their yoga class told them not to , ' so he sent someone to interview people who avoid gluten just what it was they were steering clear of			1
' this is pretty sad , ' cause i do n't know , ' the first man on the show replied			0
the second man said : ' gluten is in bread			1
it 's a flour derivative , wheat , things like that …			0
it 's like bread , pastries …			0
it 's in those things			0
gluten is like a grain , right ? ' it 's the wheat in products in like bread or pastas or rice , ' a woman said			1
' it makes you fat			0
i have n't researched it to the fullest			0
i have a girlfriend from @entity72 and she got me into it			0
' awkward : this woman said her friend is writing a book about gluten , and she did n't eat it			1
she did n't know what it was though a bit embarrassing : this man in the " superjew " t - shirt said he did n't know either the fourth man interviewed did n't have a better answer			1
according to the @entity85 only around one in 133 people in the @entity87 are intolerant to gluten , the protein found in wheat , barley and rye			1
gluten refers to the proteins found in wheat endosperm ( a type of tissue produced in seeds that 's ground to make flour )			1
gluten both nourishes plant embryos during germination and later affects the elasticity of dough , which in turn affects the chewiness of baked wheat products			2
gluten is actually composed of two different proteins : gliadin ( a prolamin protein ) and glutenin ( a glutelin protein )			2
though ' true gluten ' is sometimes defined as being specific to wheat , gluten is often said to be part of other cereal grains — including rye , barley and various crossbreeds — because these grains also contain protein composites made from prolamins and glutelins			2
it is n't necessarily bad , but some people are gluten - intolerant , meaning their bodies produce an abnormal immune response when it breaks down gluten from wheat and related grains during digestion			1
the most well - known form of gluten intolerance is celiac disease , which affects one in every 141 people in the @entity87 , according to the @entity133			2
when someone with celiac disease consumes gluten , it triggers an immune response that damages their intestines , preventing them from absorbing vital nutrients .			2
