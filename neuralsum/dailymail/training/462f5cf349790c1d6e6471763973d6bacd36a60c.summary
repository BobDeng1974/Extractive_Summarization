by @entity0 councils were last night accused by ministers of ‘ bending the law ’ with their use of @entity5 and overzealous parking wardens to catch out motorists and ‘ fill their coffers ’			1
@entity10 fired a broadside after a parking watchdog told @entity13 that councils are ignoring official guidance on enforcement			1
it said that , counter to the guidance , town halls are using surveillance cameras – which automatically issue fines – as a matter of ‘ routine ’ , and leave no room for discretion			1
@entity26 : councils overuse cctv cameras to enforce parking and road rules , a new report says mr @entity10 , the @entity32 , said it was ‘ a constitutional affront that @entity35 and women are being fined in arbitrary and unfair ways ’ to fill their cash shortfalls			1
councils are on track to make £ 635million profit from parking this year – with income from fines and penalties alone topping £ 340million			1
