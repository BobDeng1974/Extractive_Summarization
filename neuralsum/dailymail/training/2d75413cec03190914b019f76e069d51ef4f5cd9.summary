@entity1 fans will be gratified to learn their new midfield powerhouse @entity3 earned his nickname of the octopus after a particularly stirring display against rivals @entity7			1
@entity7 were @entity8 holders when they faced @entity9 in the 2009 quarter - finals , narrowly winning the tie 3 - 2 on aggregate after an extraordinary individual display from the long - legged midfielder in the @entity16 ranks			1
‘ the fans started the name because i stole so many balls from @entity21 and @entity22 , ’ he recalls			1
‘ they said it was like i had so many legs			2
‘ @entity5 has stuck ever since			1
i do n’t mind , i get the same thrill from stopping a goal as strikers do from scoring			2
’ powerhouse : @entity3 could prove to be a shrewd acquisition for @entity1 pedigree : @entity3 was nicknamed ' @entity5 ' after a series of superb displays for @entity9 against @entity7 in 2009 @entity3 is one @entity34 who can defend which is why @entity1 champions @entity1 made him their first signing of the summer by meeting a £ 12million buy - out clause while @entity39 were paying big money for an exciting forward like @entity41			1
boss @entity42 watched his side score 149 goals last season but could n’t repeat their @entity1 title success in the @entity8 , which is the club ’s holy grail			1
defeats against @entity50 and @entity51 – and losing twice to @entity52 in the league - proved to @entity42 that holding midfielders @entity54 and @entity56 were n’t strong enough against elite opposition , which is where @entity3 comes in			2
‘ the manager told me direct that he needed a player that was good defensively to improve the team , ’ explained @entity3			2
‘ @entity1 have a really good team			1
but i feel i can bring a better balance , defensively			2
‘ i get my pleasure from stopping the ball and passing it to allow strikers to score			2
’ in short , @entity3 is the extra insurance policy @entity1 need as they attempt to successfully retain the @entity69 for the first time in their history and show @entity72 that a £ 1billion investment deserves @entity75 success			1
@entity54 ’s reluctance to chase back with the same relish as he powers forward is well known			2
@entity56 was exposed during the @entity79 , particularly in @entity81 ’s humiliating 7 - 1 defeat against @entity82 , as someone who likes to go box - to - box rather than being a natural holder			2
quality : @entity3 has already impressed for @entity1 on their pre-season tour @entity81 could have done with @entity3 in the tournament but he was n’t considered by @entity89 , a consequence of an earlier indiscretion when the player pushed a referee during an under - 20s international and received a long suspension			1
the 27 - year - old promises a similar mistake wo n’t happen in @entity98			0
‘ i am a man now , before i was just a little kid , ’ he reflects			0
‘ unfortunately it happened and i was n’t selected by @entity81 after that			0
‘ it ’s definitely had an impact on my career but it also made me more determined to do better and succeed			0
i am not the same young and fiery player now who loses his temper like that			0
' my concentration now has to be playing for @entity1 but at the same time i hope my club performances here will open the door to playing for @entity81 in the future			1
of course i would love to play for them			0
’ naturally relaxed and smiley , @entity3 has been likened physically to a young @entity116			0
he has been learning @entity117 since january in anticipation of a move to @entity1 and been a popular “ tourist ” on the club ’s current pre-season tour to @entity123			1
on tuesday , he joined in a coaching session for local kids at a park next to the iconic @entity127 , watched closely by former @entity129 player @entity128 , now an @entity123 tv pundit with @entity131			1
full steam ahead : @entity3 makes his way past @entity134 during the 2009 @entity8 quarter - finals his back story is interesting			1
unlike many @entity34 players who grow up in poor neighbourhood favellas in sprawling cities like @entity141 and @entity142 , @entity56 ’s childhood was spent in the eco-town of @entity144 ( @entity145 ) , known as @entity81 ’s mystical capital			1
it is visited by thousands of tourists attracted by alleged sightings of flying saucers and other unidentified flying objects			0
surrounded by forests and waterfalls , it has become a major eco-centre with interest in hallucinogenic and other natural remedies that grow all around			0
@entity3 is a bit sceptical of the flying saucer brigade , saying : ‘ it ’s friendly , everyone knows each other and you can turn up uninvited to people ’s house			0
‘ it ’s very beautiful and we do get a lot of tourists			0
they try to find spaceships but i must admit i ’ve never seen one ! ’ solid : @entity3 will not be afraid to get right in the thick of it for @entity1 in a hugely competitive @entity1 the 6ft destroyer nearly came to @entity98 a year ago when @entity176 applied for and gained a work permit for him on the final day of the transfer window			1
but @entity9 grew impatient after there was a delay in @entity176 selling @entity181 to @entity7			1
by the time the @entity182 had got the @entity181 money , @entity9 had changed their mind			0
‘ talks were very advanced but at the last minute , @entity9 did not want to sell me , ’ says @entity3 now			0
it ’s clearly worked out for the best			0
this season he will step out for the champions			0
despite the reputation of his hometown , he is rooted in reality and will be one of the first names on @entity42 ’s team sheet when the big games come around this season			0
‘ the target is to win the @entity8 or at least to do better than last year , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve been in @entity75 since i was 19 and know the style even better than in @entity81			0
‘ i am excited because i ’ve noticed that fans in @entity98 love players who tackle hard			0
