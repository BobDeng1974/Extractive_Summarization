by @entity1 reporter published : 09:51 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 23 june 2013 researchers say that recently unearthed photos of the remote @entity5 island near the site of a reef where they believe @entity10 's plane may have landed during her doomed 1937 flight around the world could prove that the aviator and her navigator lived for a time as castaways , and did n't die in a supposed crash as previously thought			1
last month , researchers contracted by @entity18 ( @entity18 ) found what they say are sonar images of @entity10 's plane just off the coast of what is now @entity24 , which is part of the @entity26 roughly 3,000 miles northeast of @entity27 in the middle of the @entity5			1
proof ? researchers say these photos of @entity24 could prove whether @entity10 ended up a castaway after landing her plane in the @entity5 in 1937 @entity24 : this tiny , @entity5 island had its share of visitors before @entity10 supposedly landed her plane on a reef off its northwestern shore at the time of @entity10 's flight , the island was known as @entity24 , a then - uninhabited , seven - mile stretch of sand , shrubs and trees with a large lagoon at its center			1
@entity18 believes @entity10 's plane went off course while en - route to @entity48 , roughly 800 miles north of @entity24			1
the group believes the plane made a safe landing on a long , smooth reef just off the coast of @entity24 and then made it safely to shore , where @entity10 and navigator @entity55 lived until their demise			2
the new photos , discovered by @entity59 , keeper of photographs at the @entity62 air force museum in @entity63 , are aerial photos of the island taken in december of 1938 , more than a year after @entity10 's plane supposedly landed there			1
the 45 photos - found in an unlabeled box containing a sheet of paper saying ' @entity24 ' - are part of a set of aerial obliques taken by a @entity73 launched from @entity74 in support of the @entity62 @entity76 conducted as the @entity77 was looking for possible @entity5 landing strips for seaplanes , or even an airfield			2
wreckage : the ' @entity82 object ' is believed to be the location of a piece of @entity10 's plane aim : the purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the @entity10 aircraft , after landing on the reef at @entity24 ( now @entity24 ) , was subsequently washed over the reef edge , broke up in the surf , and sank ' flying laboratory ' : @entity10 's @entity93 took off from @entity94 on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight first : @entity10 was the first female pilot to fly solo over the @entity98 as @entity100 points out , the photos were taken about a month before the island 's first ' official ' habitation , which suggest that any artifacts found on the island would have had to come from @entity10 , or been washed ashore			1
' for 25 years we have struggled to tease details from a handful of printed photos			0
now we have an amazing array of detailed aerial images of every part of the atoll taken before the first colonists , or even the @entity62 survey party , set foot on the island , ' @entity109 , executive director of @entity18 , told the publication			0
what @entity109 and @entity100 fail to mention , however , is the fact that the island had residents long before the @entity77 's 1938 attempt to colonize the island - although they were n't ' official ' inhabitants			0
in fact , people had been living on the island as far back as 1915 , when @entity130 entrepreneur @entity129 acquired a license to use the island to plant coconut trees			0
as part of @entity137 's project , 20 workers were brought to @entity24 to run his coconut operation			0
they even built iron - roofed structures , which remained on the island even after a severe drought put an end to the project and the islanders were forced off			0
@entity24 had additional human contact prior to @entity10 's flight when , in 1929 , the @entity148 crashed into a reef off the island 's northwest corner - likely the same reef where @entity18 claims @entity10 landed her plane			1
wreckage : a close - up view of what scientists say could be the undercarriage of @entity10 's plane is pictured at the reef at @entity24 in 1937 analysis : a graphic shows the area looked at by @entity18 team discovery : this bottle of @entity166 's lineament was found on a desert island in the area @entity10 is believed to have crashed on an ill - fated voyage around the world in 1937 eleven of the ship 's 35 crew members died in the wreck and the fire that engulfed the ship after it ran aground			1
the remainder of the crew lived on the island - in collapsed structures from the failed @entity182 project - for several days until they were rescued			0
in the past , however , @entity18 , which has made more than 10 trips to the island in search of evidence to support its theories about @entity10 , claims to have found several items on the island that suggest the aviator - or at the very least , a female who lived in the 1930s - spent some time on the island , including @entity195 beauty and skin care products that may have dated to the 1930s , and a shattered mirror from a woman 's cosmetic compact			2
@entity18 has many critics , though , none of whom buy the group 's theories of @entity10 's final days			2
' not to impugn [ the head of @entity18 ] , but i do nâ€™t think [ the group ] found anything on any expedition , ' a curator at the @entity207 's @entity206 said during a 2012 interview with the @entity214 .			0

@entity10 's plane *disappeared* in the @entity5 during her doomed 1937 flight around the world
researchers believe they *'ve* found sonar images showing parts of her plane *lodged* on a coastal shelf just off the shores of @entity24 , about 3,000 miles northeast of @entity27
new photos taken about a year after her *disappearance* could prove whether @entity10 survived after her plane went down and lived as a castaway on the island
