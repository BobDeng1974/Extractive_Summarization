a severely injured motorcyclist has his face rebuilt using titanium plates produced by a 3d printer – a machine that creates three - dimensional , useable objects by building them from thin layers of plastic or metal			1
but the treatment that put @entity16 in the headlines last week is far from a one - off medical miracle			1
in fact , you may have been benefiting from this remarkable technology for years at your local dental practice			2
nothing new : the treatment of @entity16 , pictured before and after the operation , who had his face rebuilt using titanium plates produced by a 3d printer , is far from a one - off medical miracle no more @entity28 in dentistry , 3d scanners and printers are used to produce moulds of the mouth , replacing the unpleasant experience of having to bite into gunk - like impression material			1
‘ for 100 years dentists relied on manual impressions , made using a mouth - shaped tray filled with a quick - setting rubber , ’ says @entity36 , of @entity37 , the main supplier of 3d printers for dentistry			1
‘ this was used to make a plaster of @entity49 model of the patient ’s teeth , and helped dental technicians hand - craft crowns or dentures			0
‘ now we scan the mouth , create a computer model and send it to a 3d printer			0
‘ not only is that far quicker , it means an absolutely precise representation of your mouth and teeth , and therefore better fitting crowns or braces			0
’ dentists and surgeons regularly use 3d - printed surgical aids too , such as a mouth - shaped sheet with a hole for the drill to be used for implants			1
mr @entity36 says : ‘ before , things were done simply through knowledge and experience , but these guides use exact replicas of your mouth to show exactly where to drill , meaning fewer mistakes like hitting nerves			0
’ up to ten per cent of dentists use these digital technologies			2
motoring ahead the 3d technology first emerged in the 1980s and is commonly used by @entity87 teams			0
in fact , the engineering centre at @entity89 , which worked with the surgeons reconstructing @entity16 ’s face , was originally focused on producing prototypes for the motor industry			1
the technique works much like normal document - printing but instead of recreating a two - dimensional image from the screen , it translates a @entity101 virtual model on the computer into reality			1
objects are formed from a series of layers or particles , rather than by chiselling a shape from a block of material – meaning excellent precision and better efficiency			0
in the case of mr @entity16 , x-ray scans of his head were used as a starting point , with new guides and plates built virtually before being printed			1
painstaking : the facial models , guides and implants which were all @entity101 printed by the team at @entity124 's @entity123 striving for accuracy last month it was revealed that orthopaedic surgeons in @entity128 had created a titanium pelvis through @entity101			1
the replacement was for a patient with a rare bone cancer who had to have half his pelvis removed to stop the disease spreading			0
@entity136 , chief technical officer at @entity137 , which produced the pelvis , says : ‘ in difficult cases , 3d printing can be more appropriate as it ’s good for complex shapes , and we can build structures like lattice work that allows bone to grow into it			2
' we ’ve produced 11 pelvises in this way , and nine shoulder blades – these can be just 2mm thick in places			0
’ maxillofacial surgeon @entity151 , who carried out the operation on mr @entity16 at @entity123 in @entity124 , adds : ‘ we ’ve been using 3d printing for 12 years in pretty much every aspect of reconstructive surgery			1
pioneering : mr @entity16 's skull after the operation with temporary staples his surgeon said : ' @entity16 had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments ' ‘ for planning operations we use it to produce both virtual and physical models of the skull , and the technology has made surgery easier and far more accurate			2
instead of spending many hours in the operating theatre thinking , we now spend many hours before surgery thinking			0
‘ to some extent it ’s more time - consuming but the surgery is more accurate – we can produce a much more reliable outcome by doing things in this way			0
and entire organs in future it is likely such techniques will be used in hospitals throughout @entity184			2
‘ the challenge now is to make this a quicker , cheaper , more manageable process , ’ says mr @entity151			0
the technology is evolving fast and has vast potential , particularly for prosthetic limbs			0
‘ it could reduce two weeks ’ manual work to a night ’s printing , and produce limbs that fit better too , ’ says @entity190 , of prosthetics firm @entity191			2
there is even scope for printing entire organs			1
a kidney , strips of liver tissue and human blood vessels have all been created using 3d printers – a process known as bioprinting that works through cartridges loaded with human cells .			1

@entity16 had his face rebuilt using @entity101 printed titanium plates
however , dentists have been using the technique for several years
there is even scope for printing organs such as kidneys and liver tissue
