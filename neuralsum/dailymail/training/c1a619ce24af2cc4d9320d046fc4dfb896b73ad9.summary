by @entity0 @entity1 has told his @entity3 teammates to ‘ man up ’ after conceding they simply were n’t good enough in @entity4			1
a feeble , porous 4 - 1 defeat to @entity7 leaves @entity9 ’s champions facing a monumental task to reach the group stages for a third successive year			1
@entity1 believes , as he must , that @entity3 can still qualify			1
and he reckons @entity7 ’s players behaved at time up as if they were already through to the play - off round			1
rallying cry : @entity1 has told his team - mates to stand up and be counted yet a display characterised by dubious team selection , poor defending , weak tackling and self - inflicted errors confirmed fears that the squad inherited by @entity21 lacks the depth or investment needed to compete at @entity25 ’s highest level			1
insisting there is no time for self pity ahead of a second - leg salvage job , however , @entity26 midfielder @entity1 says @entity3 have to pick themselves up swiftly and plan a way to score three or more at @entity32			1
all whilst defending in a way which seemed beyond them in @entity4			1
‘ it was really bad , ’ said @entity35 , @entity21 ’s former lieutenant at @entity36			2
‘ when you go down to 10 men and you are keeping in the game at 2 - 1 , it ’s almost an okay result in the circumstances			2
@entity44 to climb : @entity45 was given his marching orders ‘ but that was the time when we needed to stick together and keep that scoreline until the end of the match			2
‘ you have to be tight at that time , yet we gave away two more easy goals			2
we tried to communicate things on the pitch , but we should have been tighter and not allowed @entity7 to get those goals near the finish of the match			2
‘ there is no way we should be letting them get their two penalties and their goals			2
it was bad from us and it is tough to take right now			2
‘ we need to have a sit down and talk about the game during the next days			2
what we must do is learn the lessons from @entity69 and learn how to do things better			0
‘ we need to forget about what happened as soon as possible and man up - because this was just not good enough			0
we have to accept the facts of what we need to do			0
’ early smiles : @entity74 celebrates his strike with @entity3 team - mates questions will inevitably be asked of @entity21 , who looked haunted and shocked by what transpired in the @entity79			1
a risky team selection raised eyebrows even before kick - off and in the first major test of his credibility as @entity3 manager , the @entity26 failed to secure pass marks			1
‘ i ca n’t say anything about what was said afterwards , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ that always stays in the locker room			0
‘ i also ca n’t talk for the manager but obviously he wants to win games just the same as the players do and , of course , he was disappointed with the match			0
back on track : @entity99 ( left ) celebrates scoring @entity7 's equaliser ‘ looking at the @entity7 players at the end of the match , it looked as though they were through to the next round already			0
‘ so i am going to be ready for next week because we still have a chance to be the ones celebrating at the end of the second leg			1
’ it ’s far from inconceivable @entity3 could win 3 - 0 in @entity112			1
the club ’s history is littered with unlikely comebacks against the likes of @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 last season			0
yet the lack of shape and cohesion in the current squad draws closer comparisons with the mess @entity127 inherited in 2005			0
a 5 - 0 defeat to @entity129 was almost overturned , but the loss of @entity131 to the @entity132 now comes at a heavy price			0
when they need their spiritual home most , @entity3 must now try to achieve a minor miracle at the home of @entity137 instead			1
numbers will increase , but by wednesday night just 12,000 tickets had been sold			0
down but not quite out : @entity3 's @entity140 fight for the ball while down on the turf with @entity143 insisting the team need their fanbase more than ever at @entity32 , a defiant @entity1 said : ‘ we still have a chance to get through this tie and we have to go for it			1
‘ of course i believe this can still be done			0
if there is ever a chance of doing something , i always believe in it and believe we are going to take that chance			0
‘ that is the type of person and footballer that i am			0
hopefully , everybody around the club still believes because there is still a chance for us			0
‘ it is going to be tough but we need to make sure we are ready for the second leg			1
’ if they fail , then a @entity168 play - off provides a safety net of sorts			0
but there will be no cast - iron guarantees of @entity25 football this season			0
‘ i do n’t think about @entity168 at this stage , i only think about @entity177 and being ready for this challenge next wednesday , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we still have a chance and i feel we are good enough on a better day than @entity69 to make it through to the next round			0
