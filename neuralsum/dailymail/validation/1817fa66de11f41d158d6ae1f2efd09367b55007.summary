he is the protege of @entity2 mastermind @entity1 , but ' @entity4 ' @entity3 has been pitched straight into battle at @entity6			1
in nine games there will be little time to roll out the revered brand of football which won fame and acclaim with the @entity15 and @entity16 teams of the 1970s			2
instead , the 67 - year - old is tasked with saving a failing side from relegation			1
then , successful or otherwise , he will be gone			0
but who is the man who , at 67 , is making his @entity23 debut as @entity6 ’s oldest - ever manager ? @entity3 ( left ) in action during his playing days for @entity26 against @entity27 @entity3 on a cycle ride when assistant coach with @entity16 in 1987 - seen here with @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 @entity3 has held many managerial positions both in his native @entity16 and abroad - see here at @entity27 in 1996 @entity3 is best remembered in @entity37 for his two league titles with @entity39 in the late 1990s @entity3 certainly does n’t want for experience			1
this is the 18th job of a 28 - year managerial career which has taken in nearly 900 matches and yielded 10 major trophies			1
he is best known on these shores for three - and - a - half years at @entity39 , a stay which produced two @entity48 titles – including a record 21 - point winning margin – two @entity50 and a @entity51			1
@entity3 , though , has since been accused of reckless spending – a claim he defends – and it was at @entity55 that he splashed out a club record £ 12million for @entity58 striker @entity57			0
that name alone is enough to cause alarm among followers of @entity6			0
for they paid @entity39 £ 6.75m for the @entity63 after a relatively successful two years north of the border			2
@entity6 appoint @entity3 as manager there will be a few familiure faces in the @entity23 for @entity3			2
he has worked with and against @entity32 in @entity16 @entity69 manager @entity68 is another manager that @entity3 knows well former @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity73 boss @entity72 is someone else that @entity75 knows from his time in the game successful , however , is not a word used to reflect on his time at the @entity81 and , after four league goals in 29 appearances , he left on a free transfer			1
that , of course , is not @entity89 ’s fault and there will be no scope for new additions during his time on @entity94 , should the @entity57 connection cast doubt over his judgment			0
rather , it will be his ability to make a snap judgement on those already in residence which will determine his legacy with the @entity103			0
he is certainly well remembered at the likes of @entity27 and @entity105 , where in 2008 his domestic champions beat former club @entity39 in the final of the @entity108 , a triumph which won him honorary citizenship of the @entity112 city			2
working with @entity23 players will not be new to @entity3 as he has come across many in his time in international football - including @entity69 's @entity117 while he was coach of @entity118 between 2009 - 10 former @entity120 star @entity119 is another player @entity3 has worked with during his time as @entity122 manager between 2010 - 12 @entity3 signed @entity124 international @entity123 for @entity126 side @entity125 in 2005 during his first spell in @entity128 in the mid-nineties he lifted the @entity131 and @entity132 title , working with the likes of @entity124 striker @entity134			1
his second stint in 2012 saw the club finish second in the league and lose in the cup final , but a win ratio of 65 per cent equalled that of his initial tenure and still stands as the best of his career			0
were he to win six of nine matches with @entity6 then it would perhaps eclipse everything he has achieved			0
but there have been rocky times , too			0
@entity3 has nine games left in the @entity23 season and his aim is to ensure @entity6 do n't go down despite his years of managerial experience , @entity3 has never been in a relegation battle before he was hounded from his second spell as @entity16 national - team boss after both the media and supporters were critical of his handling of the team , despite them reaching the semi-finals of @entity159			1
ten years earlier he took @entity16 to the last eight of the @entity161 but was on the brink of losing his job before the finals in the @entity165 after a fallout with star player @entity167 , who retired from international football in protest			2
subsequent posts at @entity171 and @entity122 saw his teams fail to emerge from the group stages of @entity161 2006 and @entity174 respectively , while his latest job was an unhappy five - month period in charge of @entity177 , where he was sacked in november			1
despite his origin as a pupil of @entity180 , @entity3 has been criticised for playing defensive football with too much emphasis on structure and discipline			0
however , on the evidence of @entity6 ’s shambolic 4 - 0 defeat to @entity187 on saturday , structure and discipline is probably the best place to start .			0

@entity3 has had 18 managerial jobs over a 28 year career
@entity3 is best known on these shores for his time at @entity39 where he won two league titles
@entity3 has a *lot* of experience at international level having managed @entity16 ( twice ) , @entity122 , @entity118 , @entity202 , @entity171 , and @entity177
at 67 - years - old @entity3 is @entity6 's oldest manager - so can he be successful at the @entity81
