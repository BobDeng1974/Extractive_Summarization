military rules state that if reservists ’ pay works out less than they would earn in their civilian job , they can claim for extra cash , known as a @entity12			2
so if a reservist works in the @entity16 , for example , the gap to be made up between the military pay and their civilian salary can be substantial			0
well paid : some reservists members of the @entity3 are being paid six - figure salaries because of rules that mean that if they earn less while serving , they can claim for extra cash ( file picture ) figures released under the @entity26 reveal that this year , eight reservists called up for duty were paid more than £ 100,000 for their tour			1
one of these so - called ‘ @entity16 soldiers ’ was paid £ 135,000 – several times the pay of regular soldiers – despite only holding the rank of a junior officer			1
many of those paid six - figure salaries are understood to be members of the @entity39 unit based in the @entity40 , the @entity41			0
others included members of the @entity44 and the @entity45			0
the @entity12 is intended to prevent those called up losing out financially because of their service – but some ministers believe the payments can not be justified and the pay rules are currently under review			0
an @entity54 source told @entity55 : ‘ there will have to be a tightening up of the system to limit these costs			0
it does n’t make sense to be mobilising junior soldiers on over £ 100,000 with the government picking up the bill for their @entity16 salary			1
’ several doctors and surgeons from the @entity68 medical reserve were also paid more than £ 100,000 for tours in @entity4 , with one paid £ 225,000			1
reservist pay rules are being reviewed as the @entity54 attempts to almost double the number of deployable reservists to 30,000			2
an @entity54 spokesman said there was a ‘ strict upper limit ’ to the @entity12 , adding : ‘ a significant proportion of those in receipt of a large award will be medical experts who deliver world - class care to injured troops on the battlefield			0

some serving reservists earn up to £ 225,000
last year eight reservists were paid more than £ 100,000 for their tour
