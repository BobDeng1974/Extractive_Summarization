by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:56 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 18:00 est , 6 june 2012 the @entity3 director general has lavished praise on staff for what he called their ' outstanding ' coverage of the jubilee weekend – despite a storm of protest about the standard of the programmes			1
the broadcaster 's jubilee coverage had by last night prompted 2,425 complaints from viewers			1
nearly 2,000 were about the coverage of sunday 's river pageant , which even some @entity3 figures described as ' lamentable ' and ' mind - numbingly tedious '			1
plaudits : @entity3 director general @entity23 has heaped praise on his staff for their coverage of the jubilee yet in an internal email to staff yesterday , @entity23 wrote : ' our output has been impressive not only in its scale , but in its ambition , quality and outstanding journalism			1
' by capturing the spectacle of the @entity37 and yesterday 's ceremonies alongside smaller local celebrations we reflected reaction from up and down the country			0
' he added – without irony – that the @entity3 had ' made our own contribution to a special moment in our nation 's history '			1
the extraordinary comments stunned many @entity3 journalists who are said to feel ' deeply embarrassed ' by the coverage			1
there was further incredulity when the corporation confirmed that many of the presenters who fronted the jubilee coverage will be given key roles in the @entity58			2
@entity59 – who viewers described as ' woeful ' and ' out of his depth ' during the pageant – will be fronting the ' live action ' from inside the @entity64			1
@entity3 veteran @entity65 said the number of complaints was ' very serious ' and bosses should have a ' serious rethink ' about the presenting line - up ahead of the @entity58			1
well covered ? the @entity71 at @entity72 , @entity73 , was held in celebration of @entity75 's 60 years on the throne around 500 were unhappy that the programme credits were played over the spectacular four - minute firework display @entity79 , presenting for the @entity3 on board @entity80 , was criticised by viewers the former newsreader said : ' the @entity3 should look long and hard at a lot of the presenters from that sunday			1
some of them were absolutely appalling			0
you 're only as good as your last show – and on that basis a lot of them should be very worried indeed			0
' viewers were aghast at the idea that the jubilee presenters would be featured during the @entity58			0
one wrote : ' @entity96 – @entity98 i hope the @entity3 has more up its sleeve than this for the @entity58			1
' another added : ' if we all bribe the @entity3 with cold , hard cash , will they promise not to employ @entity79 or @entity59 during the @entity58 ? ' war veterans have joined the criticism of the @entity3 river pageant coverage , claiming they were made to stand in the rain for more than an hour while waiting to be interviewed			1
@entity79 's interview with men on board @entity80 has already been condemned by viewers after she called one ' @entity111 ' when his name was @entity113			0
yesterday former petty officer @entity114 , 75 , who served on @entity80 in the @entity115 , said the shipmates ' experience was ' absolutely traumatic '			0
the 26 former seamen , all aged between 70 and 90 , were summoned to the quarterdeck , where they were left to shiver in the cold while only two were interviewed			0
mr @entity114 , from @entity122 , south @entity123 , said their day was ' completely ruined '			0
he added : ' it was appallingly inconsiderate to ask people of our age to stand for so long and get so cold			0
' a spokesman for the @entity3 said it had apologised for the delay to the interviews			1
' we endeavoured to speak to as many of the people involved in the pageant as possible			0
' as well as the river pageant , the @entity3 has received hundreds of complaints about its coverage of the palace pop concert on monday			1
around 500 were unhappy that the programme credits were played over the spectacular four - minute firework display which closed the event			0
comedian @entity141 was also criticised for cutting short @entity142 's sing - along of @entity143			0
some of the strongest critics of the @entity3 's jubilee output have been its own stars			2
@entity147 said the @entity3 's coverage of the pageant was ' mind - numbingly tedious '			1
@entity151 , a former editor of the today programme and @entity153 , called the coverage ' lamentable ' and ' scarcely credible '			0
the corporation 's obituaries editor @entity155 said that some of the coverage had him ' reaching for the sick - bag '			0
the executive responsible for the coverage has gone on holiday			0
@entity3 vision director @entity163 was unable to appear on @entity165 's today programme on wednesday to defend the corporation , although it is understood he did not leave until the coverage had been completed on tuesday			1
as a result , the job fell to former @entity3 executive @entity170 – who was less than robust in his defence of the corporation			2
@entity170 admitted that the @entity3 had ' probably tried too hard ' to be inclusive			2
what had gone wrong was ' a conscious attempt , i think , to make the whole event as it were informal and to use the modern idiom , inclusive and warm '			0
' the @entity3 just probably tried too hard			2
it 's just that the @entity3 on these occasions – and there 's a long history of it – is worried about being seen as “ @entity3 ” and being too formal and too stiff			2
' he added : ' i do n't think this is going to be the @entity3 's @entity183 winning entry next year			2
' a spokesman for the corporation said : ' the concert was watched by a peak audience of 17million , making it the highest rating show of the year , whilst an average audience of over 10million saw our coverage of the pageant , a broadcasting event of unprecedented scale and complexity			2
' @entity3 creative director @entity198 also dismissed the complaints , saying no coverage ever received a ' universal three cheers '			1
he told @entity165 's @entity202 that the @entity3 had tried to make the ' tone ' of the river parade about the ' people too ' and ' enjoying that day '			1
mr @entity198 added the @entity3 was ' happy to learn ' from the mistakes which had been made , admitting that there were ' some aspects of it perhaps which could have been better '			2
he said : ' it 's fair to criticise it and we will certainly look at it			0
but i do n't believe that you can say in every aspect this thing failed			0
