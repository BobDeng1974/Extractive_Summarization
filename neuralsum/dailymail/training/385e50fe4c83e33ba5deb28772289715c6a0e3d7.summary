the @entity0 passed legislation on thursday amending @entity2 to increase the number of hours workers must be on the clock for each week in order to qualify for health coverage through their employers			1
president @entity9 has already warned that he wo n't sign the bill and not enough members of @entity12 voted in favor of the proposed law to override the country 's chief executive			1
the measure faces a rocky road in the @entity19 , as well , where @entity20 also hold a slim , but not veto - proof , majority			1
at least 10 @entity24 senators have already voiced strong opposition to the legislation			1
president @entity9 , pictured here speaking today in @entity27 , @entity28 , already warned that he wo n't sign the bill and not enough members of @entity12 voted in favor of the proposed law to override him the bill succeeded in the @entity0 on a vote of 252 - 172 , with a dozen @entity24 crossing party lines to vote for the health care reform legislation			1
if turned into law , the measure would redefine full - time employees that are eligible for health care coverage through their work places as those that are on the schedule for 40 hours a week , up from the current 30			1
the intent of the original rule was to broaden the number of @entity45 who are covered by their employers ' health plans			0
@entity20 argue that in effect the @entity2 provision has led businesses to cut back the number of hours it assigns to part - time workers in order to avoid the health care mandate			1
' when middle - class @entity45 ca n’t work a full , 40 - hour work week because of the president ’s health care law , they ca n’t provide for their families , pay their bills , or get ahead in a tight economy , ' house speaker @entity57 said today			0
earlier this week the @entity65 said it would veto the legislation if it passed because it does n't want to aid and abet business owners ' who are looking for loopholes ' to get out out of taking ' responsibility ' for their employee 's health insurance			1
' and we certainly do n't think that we should make that easier			0
that 's not good for the @entity2 , ' @entity65 press secretary @entity75 said			2
' it 's not good for these workers			0
' ' what 's clear is that the temptation that some employers might have would only be sweetened significantly if this @entity20 change ... were to be put into place , ' he said			0
@entity57 fired back today that @entity9 's veto threat is ' a sad commentary on where his priorities lie			0
' ' @entity89 will continue putting @entity45 ’ priorities first , and the president ought to reconsider his opposition to this bill and start doing the same , ' he said			0
if every member of the @entity20 caucus showed up to vote , the @entity20 would still need nearly 45 @entity24 representatives to vote for the bill in the @entity0 to cancel out @entity9 's objection			1
when the lower chamber voted on the legislation last session it was able stir up six more @entity24 votes than it did today , but nowhere near enough to challenge the president			2
house speaker @entity57 fired back today that @entity9 's veto threat is ' a sad commentary on where his priorities lie ' the legislation never made it to the floor of the @entity24 - led @entity19 in the 113th @entity12			1
now that @entity20 run the legislative body , it is expected to pass			0
still , @entity20 have just 54 votes in the upper chamber and would need more than a third of the @entity24 caucus to flip sides to nullify a veto			0
as soon as the @entity0 passed its version of the legislation a group of 10 @entity24 senators issued statements lambasting the measure			1
' this misguided proposal would actually create the problem it ’s pretending to solve , ' @entity123 sen. @entity122 said			0
' by moving the threshold to 40 hours , a worker who already receives health coverage through their job could see their schedule cut by just one hour a week – to 39 hours instead of 40 – and their family ’s health care taken away , ' he contended			2
' that ’s not just counterproductive , it ’s wrong			0
' @entity139 sen. @entity138 called the proposal ' unacceptable ' and argued that it would ' actually encourage companies to game the system by cutting time for the millions of workers who work more than 40 hours			0
the senators argued that the legislation could raise the deficit by $ 53 billion while hanging millions of workers out to dry			0
' after voting more than 50 times to repeal it , it is simply outrageous that @entity20 are once again trying to dismantle the @entity2 with a bill that would deny workers access to affordable health coverage through their employer and add billions to the deficit , ' @entity151 sen. @entity150 said			1
@entity161 sen. @entity160 accused @entity20 of being ' fixated on denying quality , affordable health care to millions of @entity45			0
' ' instead of wasting more time on a bill that would add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit and put the health insurance of millions of workers at risk , we should be focused on finding ways to make sure even more families gain secure , affordable coverage , ' she said			2
in addition to the bill making changes to the employer mandate portion of the health care law president @entity9 said this week he 'd toss out two other pieces of legislation if they came across his desk : a bill fast tracking approval of the @entity187 pipeline and a measure that the @entity65 believes would weaken consumer protections included in the 2010 @entity191 banking bill			1
the @entity0 has plans to vote on @entity187 tomorrow			2
it already passed the bill affecting @entity193 but the vote failed to satisfy a procedural rule so the @entity0 must again vote on it if is to be formally approved .			2

the legislation amends @entity2 to increase the number of hours workers must be on the clock in order to qualify for health coverage
the bill succeeded in the @entity0 on a vote of 252 - 172 , but not enough members voted in favor of the proposal to override @entity9
the measure also faces a rocky road in the @entity19 where at least 10 @entity24 senators have already voiced strong opposition
the @entity65 said earlier this week it would veto the @entity2 change in addition a bill fast tracking the *construction* of the @entity187 pipeline and a measure it believes would weaken consumer protections
