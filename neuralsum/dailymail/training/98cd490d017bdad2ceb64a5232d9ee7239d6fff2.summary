a squirrel poses proudly with a perfectly - formed snowball while another makes sure to capture the moment ... by taking a photo			1
the pair of red squirrels were happy to play model and photographer - before the one behind the camera got fed up and wanted a turn at posing			1
the playful exchange is picture perfect , with the snow falling lightly as the squirrels play around with their new toys			0
the two red squirrels frolic about in the snow , and one decides to film their friend with a giant snowball photographer @entity21 , 30 , captured the courting pair in the woods in @entity24 , @entity25 , where he lives			1
he said : ' i took the photographs in the woods near the town , the squirrels were not skittish and are not afraid of people as they live so close to humans			1
' i fed them nuts , which they happily took from me and hid in the snow , they kept taking nuts from me and then hiding them			0
' squirrels love to hide nuts , then find them again when they are hungry so they can eat			0
' i decided to make a snowball with a nut inside and then left it on the ground			2
but the ' photographer ' gets bored of capturing the action , and decides to get involved in the scene ; and right , the squirrel 's became interested as a nut was place in the middle of the snowball ' a squirrel ran up , grabbed the snowball and picked it up			2
perhaps she sensed the nut inside			2
' then it happened again with the second snowball i made so i decided to try and do a series of shots about a squirrel photographing another squirrel holding the snowball			0
' mr @entity21 , who was only four metres away from the pair , set up a camera on a tripod and made another snowball with nuts inside for the squirrels so he could snap the adorable snowy scene			1
the adorable scene was shot by photographer @entity21 , 30 , in the woods in @entity24 , @entity25 he said : ' a squirrel ran up to the camera almost straight away and began to sniff it			1
' a second squirrel grabbed a snowball and picked it up , again , probably to feel if there was a nut in it			0
' she dropped it and picked it up again and it looked like she was posing for the camera			0
the squirrel to the left stands upright and gives its best side for the camera , dictated to by its partner in crime ' then the first squirrel climbed onto the camera , reached for its friend and grabbed her snowball			0
' it was a nice moment and to capture it with the two squirrels simultaneously i made more than ten snowballs			1
' squirrels are very playful and curious animals , and i was happy to photograph this moment			0

@entity21 , 30 , photographed the pair of red squirrels in the woods in @entity24 , @entity25
the pair played with snowballs and posed for the camera - clever enough to realise inside was a nut
lovely moment where one gets behind camera to snap their friend , but then gets bored and *joins* in
