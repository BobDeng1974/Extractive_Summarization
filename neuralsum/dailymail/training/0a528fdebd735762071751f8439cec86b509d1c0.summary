by @entity0 and @entity1 science and law have led to the exoneration of hundreds of criminal defendants in recent decades , but big questions remain : how many other innocent defendants are locked up ? how many are wrongly executed ? about one in 25 people imprisoned under a death sentence is likely innocent , according to a new statistical study appearing in the @entity11			1
and that means it is all but certain that at least several of the 1,320 defendants executed since 1977 were innocent , the study says			1
from 1973 to 2004 , 1.6 percent of those sentenced to death in the @entity17 — 138 prisoners — were exonerated and released because of innocence			1
troubling : a new report says that data shows that up to 1 out of every 25 inmates sentenced to death could be innocent @entity24 was executed in @entity25 in 1989 after he was convicted of murdering a gas station attendant			1
evidence later showed that @entity24 was likely innocent but the great majority of innocent people who are sentenced to death are never identified and freed , says professor @entity31 of the @entity32 , the study 's lead author			1
the difficulty in identifying innocent inmates stems from the fact that more than 60 percent of prisoners in death penalty cases ultimately are removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment			1
once that happens , their cases no longer receive the exhaustive reviews that the legal system provides for those on death row			2
gross and three other researchers , including a biostatistics expert , looked at the issue using a technique often used in medical studies called survival analysis			0
@entity57 biostatistics expert @entity56 , who was n't part of the study , said the work done by @entity31 " seems to be a reasonable way to look at these data			2
" because of various assumptions , it might be best to use the margin of error in the study and say the innocence rate is probably between 2.8 percent and 5.2 percent , said @entity70 statistics professor @entity69 , who was n't part of the study			2
the study is the first to use solid and appropriate statistical methods to address questions of exoneration or false convictions , an important subject , said @entity79 professor @entity78 , who also is a professor of epidemiology at the @entity81			0
the research combines data from three independent sources , a rigorous approach used by few studies on capital punishment , he said			0
@entity88 was executed in @entity89 in 1990 after getting convicted of murdering two police officers			0
after his death , another man admitted to killing the officers the research produced an estimate of the percentage of defendants who would be exonerated if they all remained indefinitely on death row , where their cases would be subject to intense scrutiny for innocence			2
the study concluded that the number of innocent defendants who have been put to death is ' comparatively low			1
... our data and the experience of practitioners in the field both indicate that the criminal justice system goes to far greater lengths to avoid executing innocent defendants than to prevent them from remaining in prison indefinitely			0
' death sentences represent less than one - tenth of 1 percent of prison sentences in the @entity17 , but they account for 12 percent of known exonerations of innocent defendants from 1989 to 2012			1
one big reason is that far more attention and resources are devoted to reviewing and reconsidering death sentences			0
' the high rate of exoneration among death - sentenced defendants appears to be driven by the threat of execution , ' says the study			1
' but most death - sentenced defendants are removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment , after which the likelihood of exoneration drops sharply			2
' the study estimates that if all defendants sentenced to death remained in that status , ' at least 4.1 percent would be exonerated			1
we conclude that this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of false conviction among death sentences in the @entity17			1
' @entity140 was executed in @entity25 in 1992 after he was convicted for murdering a nun			0
after his execution , serious doubts about his guilt were raised the study notes that there has been no shortage of lawyers and judges who assert confidently that the number of false convictions is negligible , citing @entity152 and @entity154 justice @entity153			0
' our ( criminal ) procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted			0
it is an unreal dream , ' @entity159 said in 1923			0
in 2007 , @entity153 wrote that @entity17 criminal convictions have an ' error rate of 0.027 percent — or , to put it another way , a success rate of 99.973 percent			1
' the study said @entity153 's numbers ' would be comforting , if true , ' but added : ' the rate of error among death sentences is far greater than @entity153 's reassuring 0.027 percent , " based on the number of death row exonerations that have already occurred			1
the study said that " most innocent defendants who have been sentenced to death have not been exonerated , and many — including the great majority of those who have been resentenced to life in prison — probably never will be			1
' * @entity88 was convicted of murdering two police officers in @entity89 in 1976 during a routine traffic stop			0
the driver of the car in which @entity88 was riding admitted to killing the officers after @entity88 was put to death in 1990 * @entity140 was convicted of raping and murdering a nun in @entity25 in 1981			2
after his 1992 execution , dna evidence showed that another man who had been arrested for committing similar crimes in the same area likely was the person who killed the nun @entity140 was put to death for murdering			2
@entity140 also was 17 at the time of the crime and was severely mentally handicapped , which led to heavy criticism of the state of @entity25 for allowing a person who is both a juvenile and mentally handicapped to be executed			0
* @entity24 was executed in 1989 after being convicted of the 1983 murder of a 24 - year - old gas station attendant in @entity25			0
an investigation published by the @entity201 cast serious doubt on @entity24 's guilt and offered new evidence that suggested a man who looked similar to @entity24 , @entity206 , may have committed the murder .			0

the study suggests that several of the 1,320 people executed in the @entity17 since the death penalty was *reinstated* in 1977 have been innocent
between 1973 and 2004 , 138 condemned prisoners were exonerated and released before they were executed
the study 's author says that the great majority of innocent people who are sentenced to death are never identified and freed , and subsequently put to death for crimes they did n't commit
