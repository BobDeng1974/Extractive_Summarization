@entity0 is still haunted by the game which was the catalyst for @entity3 ’s greatest ever achievement			1
it was in 1999 , another @entity6 tie , a semi-final			2
it was at @entity9 , with 90 minutes of a replay having failed to separate the two teams that then dominated @entity13 football in that era			0
@entity3 were down to 10 men and @entity16 had missed a penalty for @entity18 in the final minute of normal time with the game locked at 1 - 1			1
@entity0 looks on dejectedly after losing the @entity6 semi-final replay to @entity3 in 1999 @entity16 ( right ) missed a penalty in that game in @entity3 's treble winning season @entity26 ( right ) struck @entity3 's winner with a sensational solo effort to send them through to the final then on 109 minutes , @entity31 misplaced a pass , @entity26 picked up the ball in his own half and set off on a run which would end up in him revealing an alarming amount of chest hair after scoring one of the great goals in the history of the tournament			1
in @entity0 ’s mind , it tipped the balance in the title race and provided the foundation for @entity3 to achieve an unprecedented treble of @entity6 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
‘ i can still hear the shouts of that team , having won , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ they could n’t believe it because they were down to 10 men			2
and i think that put them in a state of euphoria			0
in the same way , they won the title — just			0
‘ i saw that goal again when @entity26 retired			1
i think that goal won them the treble because , if @entity16 scores , i think the game is over			1
it was a trauma for us and a positive for them			0
that goal was certainly what decided their season			2
’ @entity0 still remembers the details of the title run in , saying : ‘ they played at @entity74 and we lost at @entity76 in the last minute , when @entity77 was kicked off [ the pitch ]			0
@entity80 - @entity79 scored at the far post and @entity82 hit the bar twice			2
after that , they won the @entity49 final in the last minutes — 1999 was a miracle year for them			2
’ @entity16 recalls missing the penalty in his book and admitted it bothered him for a while after the game @entity26 ( second left ) will now take on @entity0 from the dugout as an assistant to @entity96 @entity0 will be hoping to avenge the defeat by beating @entity3 in monday 's @entity6 quarter - final @entity16 in his book , @entity100 , said : ‘ i still took the odd [ penalty ] without problems , without hesitation and without missing			1
but that miss did bother me for quite a while and next season @entity107 became our penalty taker			0
’ @entity110 , who was interviewed for the same book , said : ‘ in those days it was only us and @entity3			1
@entity16 , if he scores that penalty , we win the double because ... their heads would have gone down in the league			1
’ as for monday , @entity0 said : ‘ let ’s not consider @entity3			1
let ’s focus on our performance			0
they play at home where they feel confident			0
so , to compensate that we have to put more effort in and produce a really top - level performance			0

@entity18 were beaten 2 - 1 by 10 - man @entity3 in 1999
@entity16 had a penalty saved by @entity129
@entity26 then struck the winner with an *incredible* solo goal
