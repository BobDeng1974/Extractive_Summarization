by @entity0 brainstorming meetings are usually considered a great way to come up with ideas			0
but a new paper says they 're actually a less - effective way of generating quality suggestions than a more - focussed alternative , known as creative design reasoning the study found that generating a lot of ideas in the hope that ‘ quantity breeds quality ’ does n’t actually work			1
does brainstorming really work ? researchers have found that generating lots of ideas in the hope that some turn out good does n't really work the paper , ‘ brainstorming versus creative design reasoning , ’ is being presented at the @entity23 and @entity24 conference in @entity25 next month			1
in it design theorist dr @entity27 of the @entity29 and three other @entity31 researchers studied groups in brainstorming sessions			0
‘ the major result presented in the current work is the invalidity of @entity37 [ @entity38 ] hypothesis of brainstorming , ’ they write			0
in the study dr @entity27 split 30 designers up into ten groups of three			1
scientists from @entity47 carried out experiments into the value of brainstorming			0
individual students and groups were asked to come up with as many ideas as they could on how to improve the university			2
this showed that four individual students generated up to 44 per cent more ideas and covered a wider range of topics than a four in a group together			2
this showed that groups were worse as people fixated on the same ideas			0
they concluded that it might be more productive to work individually			0
‘ the 30 participants were all either engineering designers or industrial designerswith an average of 12 years of professional experience in r&d and innovation , ’ according to the researchers			2
each team was then tasked to devise ‘ a breakthrough museumconcept that gives the visitor an immersive experience in an @entity78 - likeworld ’ , a task that was purposefully ambiguous			1
there were a number of additional requirements , such as the museum having to be mobile and eco-friendly			0
each team had 90 minutes to come up with their museum idea , summarised in the end on a piece of @entity89 , before presenting their idea to the researchers			0
during the ‘ brainstorming ’ sessions to the conversations of each group were recorded and the researchers counted the number of ‘ known ’ ideas , such as ‘ a museum has an entrance , ’ and ‘ unknown ideas , ’ like imagining ‘ a museum that is a zeppelin			1
’ in the study the ten teams were asked to design museums that focused on @entity78 , with a few requirements including the museum being mobile , but otherwise they were left to their own devices a panel of 14 professionals , a mixture of museum experts and project managers , who were unaware of the nature of the research were then asked to rate the ten final designs according to novelty , feasibility and value			1
they found that , generally , the teams that created the most ideas then suffered in their final design			1
those that generated less had more designs that were more well received by the professionals			2
on average each team generated 82 ideas , but the best performing team generated just 60			0
‘ thus , we reject @entity37 , ’ the researchers conclude .			1

ten teams of three designers were asked to brainstorm ideas
they were tasked with creating a mobile museum of @entity78
14 *independent* professionals then ranked each of the final designs
the study found that the teams that generated less ideas performed better
the researchers conclude that ' quantity breeds quality ' is n't true .
