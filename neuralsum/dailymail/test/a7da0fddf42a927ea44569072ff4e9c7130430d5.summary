another day , another baton change , another away defeat for @entity2			1
@entity3 would surely have made his defenders walk home from @entity6 were it not for the probability they ’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles			1
this was that kind of game , a top - of - the - table occasion when @entity2 needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create , they did not contain			1
they might have survived with deficiencies in one department , but not both			2
what a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season			2
what a cruel time for the @entity25 ’s best defence to explode at the seams			1
@entity28 's shot flies into the top corner of @entity31 ' net on 65 minutes @entity6 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity32 ; @entity33 ( @entity34 60 ) , @entity35 , @entity36 ; @entity37 , @entity38 ( @entity39 90 ) , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 69 )			1
subs not used : @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			0
booked : @entity38 , @entity39			0
goals : @entity43 37 , @entity28 65			1
@entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity31 ; @entity52 ( @entity53 63 ) , @entity54 , @entity55 , friend ; @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 84 ) ; @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 62 ) , reach ; @entity63			1
subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			0
referee : @entity70 ( @entity71 ) attendance : 19,656			0
they gifted @entity43 his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to @entity28 scoring his 19th in the second half			1
with that , @entity6 rose and @entity2 fell			1
that has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division , for which everyone and no - one has staked a claim			0
the @entity25 lead which @entity2 held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times , with @entity6 back in prominence and @entity3 sounding like a man searching for a positive note			1
@entity3 said : ‘ the players are completely destroyed but i am very proud of them			0
we have players who have come from @entity95 and other teams in the @entity25 , a lot of young players , and we are fighting with the best teams in the @entity25			1
no one could have expected this position			0
‘ the people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second			0
i do n’t want to forget our position is amazing			0
’ true enough , but the reality is @entity2 have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot			1
they were woeful in falling at @entity112 last month and have now lost four of their past five away games			1
@entity54 slides in vain to try and block @entity43 's opening goal the @entity6 captain managed to slide the ball under @entity2 keeper @entity31 @entity43 celebrates with his team - mates after giving @entity6 a first - half lead but their misery has been @entity6 ’s gain			1
what a luxury to have two strikers as effective as @entity43 and @entity28			1
they were , as @entity3 said , ‘ the difference ’			0
and in the context of the season , their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh			0
here , they had help			0
in the first instance , for @entity43 ’s 37th - minute opener , @entity54 and @entity52 made a hash of the basics			1
@entity38 was given too much time to cross from the right and @entity54 misread the flight , allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him			0
@entity52 could have covered but was out of position			0
at this level , in that situation , there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than @entity43			2
his touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns			0
he is the only @entity6 player in history to do that ; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level			2
‘ he ’s a @entity161 player , ’ said @entity6 manager @entity160			2
‘ it ’s just a question of whether we are all together as a @entity161 team			0
’ @entity6 made it 2 - 0 with 25 minutes to go			2
again , the ease with which @entity28 turned @entity54 will have bothered @entity3 , as will @entity57 ’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build - up			2
but , really , it was all about the finish , the striker ’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area			2
@entity28 said he only joined @entity6 for the prospect of @entity161 football			1
he might just get it			0
@entity160 said : ‘ i expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future			2
but in front of us is a very serious job			0
’ @entity6 goalkeeper @entity32 gets a boot to the face from @entity2 forward @entity188 @entity32 points to the heavens after @entity28 's goal put @entity6 2 - 0 up and settled the game			1

@entity2 started the day top of the @entity25 on *75* points
@entity43 opened the score before @entity28 's brilliant strike
@entity6 end the day in third place after @entity112 and @entity201 win
