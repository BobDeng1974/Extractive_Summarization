by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:21 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 12:23 est , 30 january 2014 @entity4 president @entity3 is to use a pub lunch with @entity6 to pour scorn on @entity9 plans to claw powers back from @entity11			1
the two men are expected to clash during the meeting in the prime minister 's local , with mr @entity3 claiming @entity15 will have to wait ‘ years ’ before it is able to rewrite the terms of its membership of the @entity20			1
the row is likely to overshadow tomorrow 's @entity4 summit in @entity23 , which comes just days after the president split from his partner following an affair with an actress			1
awkward : @entity28 insisted there would be no role for spouses when @entity6 hosts @entity4 president @entity3 for a summit this week mr @entity6 and mr @entity3 will appear @entity33 at the summit at @entity35 in the pm 's constiuency tomorrow morning before continuing their deliberations in a traditional @entity39 pub. mr @entity6 and president @entity3 will agree further defence co-operation on the development of new armed drones			1
but ahead of the talks mr @entity3 ’s spokesman said it was ‘ very , very unlikely ’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017 , when mr @entity6 has pledged an in / out referendum on @entity20 membership			1
and he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from @entity15			0
in a briefing for journalists in @entity58 ahead of the summit , the president ’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017			1
‘ this does n’t mean we wo n’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union , but it is very , very unlikely this will be compatible with the @entity15 political calendar , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s in our interests that @entity15 remains within @entity71 , but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the @entity20			1
it is in our interests that @entity15 remains within @entity71 but that can not happen at the price of dismantling @entity71			0
’ happier times : @entity3 and @entity83 on the night he was elected @entity4 president the official went on to warn that if the next @entity87 agrees to a referendum , companies will be less willing to invest in the @entity15 as the date for the vote approaches			2
he said : ‘ the more the question becomes concrete in @entity15 national debate , the more investors and the business community warn what a @entity15 out of @entity71 would mean			0
‘ when investors talk , they want to access the @entity71 market through the @entity15			0
this access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in @entity71			0
‘ if these rules are not wanted in the @entity15 , it will no longer have access to [ the @entity71 market ]			0
’ the @entity4 media said the prime minister would take the president to an @entity23 pub. to save his blushes , there will be a ‘ no spouses ’ programme – meaning mr @entity6 will not be accompanies by his wife @entity113			0
pub diplomacy : @entity116 sought to win over @entity4 president @entity117 in 2000 with a pint in the @entity120 restaurant in the @entity122 's constituency in @entity123 ahead of a summit in @entity125 in 2003 mr @entity116 repeated the trick , taking @entity128 president @entity127 to the @entity130 pub in his constituency unlike the @entity4 presidency , @entity28 has refused to confirm or deny any reports about what will be discussed at the summit			2
but @entity4 officials said the @entity15 and @entity125 will deepen their co-operation on defence by developing a new generation of armed drones			2
they will sign announce that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two - year study on building armed drones for their countries ’ military , @entity4 officials said yesterday			2
the ‘ entente frugale ’ military agreement between @entity125 and the @entity15 was first signed in 2010 , as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression			0
tomorrow , the two leaders will say they have gone further and will work together on developing a predator - type drone			2
at the summit at @entity35 , they will also announce greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors .			1
