@entity0 said it was ' amazing ' that @entity2 opposed the idea of ensuring jobless families could not receive more in handouts than those in work benefits claimants will not be able to receive more from the state than the average working household earns under a tough new £ 26,000 - a - year cap launched today			1
@entity0 said it was a ‘ big day for benefits reform ’ as the cap was imposed in the first areas ahead of the nationwide rollout from this summer			2
larger families and those living in the @entity20 are expected to be hardest hit by the decision to limit benefits to £ 500 - a - week for couples and single parents and £ 350 for single people			1
the policy has proven hugely popular in @entity28 polling , with the prime minister saying ‘ amazingly ’ @entity2 oppose the idea of insisting handouts should not be higher than average incomes in homes where someone goes out to work			1
the changes are being introduced to cut @entity38 ’s vast welfare bill and bring the level which can be claimed on benefits into line with average earnings			0
the average household will lose £ 93 - a - week			1
mr @entity0 wrote on @entity44 : ‘ a big day for welfare reform as we pilot a cap on benefits equal to the average wage			2
’ half of the 56,000 affected affected by the cap are lone parents while 39 per cent are couples with children			1
one in 10 families have more than six children and almost half of all those hit by the cap live in @entity20			1
work and pensions secretary @entity60 said : ' the benefit cap is a key part of our reforms to restore fairness to the welfare state			0
' it will provide clear incentives for people to get into employment and will give taxpayers the assurance that high claims out are no longer possible			0
' we have also ensured vulnerable people are protected with clear exceptions for people claiming disability benefits			0
' but we have a very clear message : we will provide support to those who need it , but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard working families are over			2
' the prime minister said the start of the changes marked a big day for the governments moves to overhaul @entity38 's welfare system the clampdown on out - of - work benefits is part of a raft of changes the government is introducing to curb steep rises in the @entity38 's benefits bill the cap , expected to save £ 275 million in 2013 - 14 , covers out - of - work benefits such as @entity102 , plus @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			1
however , there are exemptions if someone in the household receives @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity116 pension			0
from today the cap comes into force in the four @entity20 boroughs of @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
national roll - out will begin in july , with the policy coming fully into force in october as part of wider reforms to combine a raft of benefits into a single @entity131			1
more than half of the 56,000 families affected by the benefits cap have four or more children , according to estimates by the @entity136 @entity137 , head of economics and social policy at right - leaning think tank @entity140 , said : ' £ 26,000 a year is an awful lot of money			1
for this reason , it is completely right to assess what level of support taxpayers are willing to give to any one family			0
' we also need to remember that unconditional support is still available to those on disability benefits that the government does not expect to work : they are exempt from the cap			1
' ministers claim the prospect of the cap being introduced has already acted as a spur to encourage the jobless in the @entity20 pilot areas to find work , with 8,000 fewer people affected than planned			1
employment minister @entity163 said : ‘ over the course of the last few months we ’ve been working with families affected by the cap - @entity168 and local councils - and what we have seen is 8,000 people go into work , and we ’ve seen fewer people affected by the benefit cap			1
ministers claim 8,000 fewer people will be affect by the benefits cap than first thought after more people found work ‘ so , whereas back in july we thought 56,000 families would be affected , now it ’s 40,000 families , ’ he told @entity181 ’s today programme			1
‘ i think what people want to see is a benefits system that ’s fair , that ’s affordable , and that encourages people into work			2
these reforms help deliver that			0
’ but some charities have warned people affected with struggle to make up the short fall in the income , and could be forced to move away from the area in which they live			1
@entity200 , chief executive of the @entity202 charity for single parents , said : ' half of those affected by the benefit cap will be single parents and we are deeply concerned about the impact this will have on families and communities			2
' the cap does n’t begin to tackle the underlying problems of the shortage of low - cost social housing and the difficulties that single parents face in finding family - friendly jobs , affording childcare and making work pay			2
' more than twice as many children than adults will be affected by the cap			2
we fear that many children will be pushed deeper into poverty or uprooted from their communities , schools and family networks as a result			0
' opponents have also questioned the use of the figures to suggest the cap is already working			0
@entity233 , the @entity234 and a former chief economist at the @entity136 , said there was ‘ no evidence at all ’ that the cap had affected people 's behaviour			2
‘ the actual analysis published by the @entity136 makes it quite clear that they do not attempt to analyse any impact of behavioural change and that there is as yet no evidence one way or the other that there is behavioural change , ’ he said last week			0
but the @entity136 said that it had followed the correct procedures in publishing the data			0
‘ the original forecasts were based on impact assessments last year and have now been updated due to further developments , " a spokesman said			0
‘ we have followed the correct procedures for publishing this data by our statisticians and it is available for anyone to study			0
claims to the contrary are utterly unfounded			0
’ almost nine in 10 of those affected by the cap have children , the @entity136 said @entity266 , @entity2 ’s shadow employment minister , said : ' for all the @entity270 rhetoric , the true picture of this government is one of economic failure			1
' they are having to borrow £ 245 billion more than they planned , not to pay for the investment needed to grow our economy , but to pay for more welfare spending caused by high unemployment			0
' we desperately need a change of direction			0
@entity2 has called for a compulsory jobs guarantee to give the long - term unemployed a job , which they will have to take up or lose their benefits			1
