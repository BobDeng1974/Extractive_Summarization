by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 put pen to paper on a new contract with @entity5 that made him the highest - paid player in world football on £ 16.3million a year			1
the @entity5 forward was pictured with club president @entity9 signing his new deal two days after the @entity12 season ended			1
@entity1 overtook @entity14 superstar @entity13 ( £ 15m ) on the list of highest - paid football players			1
@entity31 , the highest - paid player in @entity32 , is on £ 15.6m a year ( £ 300,000 a week )			1
@entity1 ’s previous deals have been structured so that basic pay before bonuses is re-set each year of the deal according to bonuses earned the previous season			0
in effect @entity1 will earn £ 16.3m next season but if he wins the @entity42 the appropriate bonus will be added and the sum total will become his new basic pay level the following season			0
@entity1 ’s £ 250m buy - out clause will remain the same leaving the door open for @entity48 or @entity49 to make a bid , though the rigours of @entity51 surely rule out such a move for either club			0
a statement issued by the @entity56 last friday read : ' @entity5 has reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding @entity1 to the club as a professional first team player			2
the revised and updated contract will be signed over the next few days			0
' warming up : @entity1 and his @entity5 team - mates trained on friday ahead of saturday 's crunch clash most crucially from the club ’s point of view , @entity1 ’s new deal means @entity5 will now be better placed to tap in to the huge stream of commercial revenue he generates as for the first time since signing his initial deal in 2005 the player will not keep 100 per cent of his image rights - they will now be shared with the club .			2

@entity1 now paid more than @entity13 ( £ 15m a year )
