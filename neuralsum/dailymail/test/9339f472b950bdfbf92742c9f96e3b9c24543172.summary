concerns are growing over @entity2 ships that have docked in a once - secret naval base in the @entity4			1
military leaders in @entity6 are nervous about its powerful neighbour 's presence on its ' strategically important ' coastline following a spike in tensions between @entity2 and @entity13 nations			1
some experts have criticised the shutting down of @entity16 - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of @entity20 - which has been closed since 2009			1
but fears have once again peaked after three @entity2 ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility			1
show of strength : @entity6 's military leaders are growing concerned after three @entity2 warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base ( file photo ) deep inside the country 's mountainous terrain aggression : in february , @entity36 planes intercepted two @entity2 bombers ( file photo ) which had flown into @entity40 territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course force : and late last year , the @entity2 navy anti-submarine ship @entity44 ( file photo ) and three other @entity2 ships had to be escorted out of the @entity48 channel it was originally shut because the country 's leaders thought the threat from @entity53 was reduced , despite its massive @entity54 which is base in the nearby @entity56			1
@entity6 's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was ' pure madness ' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region			1
this is far from the first time @entity2 has flexed its military muscles in other countries ' territory			1
in february , a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two @entity2 bombers that flew through @entity40 - controlled airspace without warning			2
the disruption on february 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which @entity48 @entity77 fighters were scrambled to escort the @entity2 vessels			2
that move was perceived as a show of strength by @entity2 president @entity82 over the @entity84 conflict after prime minister @entity85 accused him of challenging the ' territorial integrity ' of @entity87			0
it followed a separate incident when the @entity90 had to intercept a @entity2 warship which strayed to close to the @entity48 while passing through the @entity92 the same month			0
the @entity94 - class warship – equipped with missiles , anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily - armed @entity48 frigate			0
cat and mouse : heavily - armed @entity101 follows the @entity2 warship ( back left ) as it passes through the @entity92 in february intercepted : footage released on @entity2 tv showed the moment two @entity36 jets escorted the @entity2 bomber in february concerned : they are worried by this perceived show of strength from @entity53 ( @entity2 president @entity82 pictured ) and its presence on its ' strategically important ' coastline and late last year , the @entity111 had to escort another @entity2 destroyer and three other boats from the @entity92 as they passed through the @entity114 after carrying out military exercises in the @entity116			1
since january 2014 , there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by @entity2 near the @entity48			2
the most serious included : feb 18 : @entity36 jets scrambled after two @entity2 @entity122 bombers spotted off the coast of @entity124 , forcing a flight from @entity126 to divert			0
feb 15 : @entity2 warship intercepted by @entity90 in the @entity92			0
jan 28 : @entity36 fighters challenge two @entity2 bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of @entity131			0
jan 8 : defence chiefs ask for @entity134 help to hunt a suspected @entity2 submarine lurking off the coast of @entity137			0
nov 2014 : @entity2 flotilla on military exercise in the @entity92 escorted from @entity48 waters by @entity141			2
nov 2014 : @entity13 aircraft called in to hunt suspected @entity2 submarine off the west coast of @entity137			0
oct 2014 : @entity36 @entity77 warplanes shadow two @entity146 as they fly down the west coast of @entity48			0
@entity148 added : ' we are the only country along with @entity2 to have a permanent presence in the @entity152 , where we share a common border			2
obviously our navy should be stationed there , including our submarines			0
if the ships are n't there where they are needed , they might as well be scrapped altogether			0
' the armed forces put the base - which cost over £ 390million to construct - up for sale on @entity6 's version of @entity165			1
it was eventually bought for just £ 3.5million by a @entity6 businessmen and was rented out to @entity2 research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country 's state - owned energy giant @entity169			1
its landlord @entity171 said : ' there are no longer any secrets surrounding this base ... not since the military and @entity13 agreed to put it on sale over the @entity179 , along with photographs of every nook and cranny			0
' many military experts are now worried by the the potential for @entity2 military activity aboard the research vessels			2
a former second in command for the @entity6 military said : ' @entity2 is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business			1
it 's clear , very few people know what happens on these vessels			0
' @entity198 believes the sale of @entity200 was ' a double loss ' as ' @entity6 's armed forces lost an important base and now there are @entity2 vessels docked there ' .			1
