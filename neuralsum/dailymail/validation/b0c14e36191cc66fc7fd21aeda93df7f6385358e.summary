there has long been tradition for mothers to pass on beauty lessons to their daughters			1
but now , mums are just as likely to ask their daughters for advice — particularly because the boom in online beauty bloggers means that young people have access to professional techniques at their fingertips			1
all you need to do is @entity17 ‘ smoky eye ’ and you ’ll find dozens of videos showing you how to do it			1
it ’s no surprise that these online beauty gurus have legions of followers , and two of the biggest @entity24 stars are @entity25 - based sisters @entity26 and @entity27 , whose @entity29 site has millions of viewers worldwide			1
when i met the girls , they were quick to credit their mother @entity34 , 58 , with giving them some of the best tips they still follow			1
@entity27 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) credit their mother @entity34 ( centre ) with giving them some of their best beauty tips which they still follow @entity34 , too , loves having make - up artist daughters and readily admits that some of the best tricks she has learned have been from @entity26 and @entity27			1
with @entity49 coming up , i met with @entity34 , @entity26 and @entity27 to learn their top tricks			1
@entity51 , 37 , and @entity52 , 34 : @entity53 has taught @entity54			1
always remove your make - up			1
dirt builds up on the skin throughout the day and it blocks your pores and leads to breakouts			1
cleanse thoroughly before bed to remove both dirt and make - up — it will also keep your pillowcases clean ! moisturise twice a day and remember to apply the cream to your neck , too — our neck and hands are often the first places to show signs of ageing but they are nearly always forgotten			1
dry skin is common in our family , so for us it ’s extra important to moisturise properly			2
we also use a more intensive treatment in the evening			2
@entity81 taught us to stay out of the sun. too much sunbathing leads to wrinkles and age spots in later life			2
as a family , we have porcelain - pale skin so have always been cautious about lying out in the midday sun. have your eyebrows shaped professionally			2
@entity93 can give you a startled appearance and once you have made a brow mistake , it can take years for them to grow back			2
finally , the best tip we ’ve learned is to drink plenty of water			2
alongside the obvious health benefits , staying hydrated shows in our skin , too			2
it helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture			2
@entity106 : my daughters taught me			1
choose the correct moisturiser for your skin type			2
it ’s easy to just grab any one , but you need to make sure you are using something that is tailored to your skin			0
i am lucky because the girls help me shop for foundation			1
however , if you struggle to choose the correct shade you should try it along your jawbone and then go outside into the daylight to check how well it blends into your skin			0
@entity27 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) say their mum , @entity34 ( centre ) , taught them to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water as it helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture thin eyebrows can be so ageing and mine are a little overplucked from embracing the thin brow trend in the @entity134			1
now the girls have taught me how to cheat my way to fuller brows with a brow pencil , i have a more youthful look			1
the importance of blending with a foundation brush can not be underestimated			0
i could n’t be without my @entity142 ( £ 9.99 , @entity143 )			0
the wide , firm bristles make it easier to apply and smooth foundation			0
finally , use an eyeshadow primer			0
my eyelids are quite oily and my eyeshadow often creases , so when @entity26 and @entity27 taught me to layer eye products , starting with an eyeshadow primer , it totally changed my look			1
treats to make mother ’s day @entity156 @entity159 limited edition vintage design in time for @entity49 , @entity159 has launched a limited edition vintage design ( £ 5.99 , @entity143 )			0
