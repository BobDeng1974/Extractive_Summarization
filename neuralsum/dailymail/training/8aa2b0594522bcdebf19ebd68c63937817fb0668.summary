by @entity1 reporter published : 14:57 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 07:52 est , 17 september 2013 in a blistering warning to congressional @entity4 , president @entity2 said monday it would be the ' height of irresponsibility ' for lawmakers to cause a new economic crisis just five years after the near - collapse of the nation 's financial system			1
' i can not remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it ca n't get 100 percent of what it wants , ' @entity2 said			1

the @entity43 's @entity93 on sunday issued a report detailing policies that it says have helped put the economy on a path toward growth			0
those steps range from the unpopular @entity101 , or @entity101 , that shored up the financial industry and bailed out auto giants @entity102 and @entity103 , to an $ 800 billion stimulus bill to sweeping new bank regulations			0

what 's more , some banks that received government aid because they were deemed ' too big to fail ' are now bigger than they were in 2008 , although they are smaller as a share of the economy than the largest banks in other big economies			0
three years after @entity2 signed a sweeping overhaul of lending and high - finance rules , execution of that law is behind schedule			1
anxious to make his case with the public , @entity2 intends to draw attention to signs of progress with daily events this week , including a speech wednesday to the @entity174 , an association of ceos from the top @entity85 companies , and a trip friday to @entity178 to visit a @entity180 plant , where he will promote the strength of the auto industry			2
@entity2 wants to reverse automatic spending cuts that kicked in in march , but at the same time he has said he will not negotiate with @entity4 over the nation 's debt ceiling			2
