by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 31 july 2012 updated : 13:12 est , 31 july 2012 it is the device that merged technology with style and revolutionised the entire tech industry			0
yet five years after the release of the first @entity8 , @entity6 's legendary designer sir @entity5 has admitted that the company almost cancelled the product that made him a household name			1
sir @entity5 - known affectionately as @entity5 to @entity6 fans - said : ' there were multiple times where we nearly shelved the phone because we thought there were fundamental problems that we ca n't solve ... [ such as ] ... where i put the phone to my ear and my ear dials the number			1
' the designer was speaking at an @entity30 - themed @entity29 @entity28 event this week , which was attended by @entity32 and other special guests			0
@entity34 of @entity35 talks with designer @entity5 at the @entity36 in @entity37 on monday sir @entity5 talked through @entity6 's design process , and said @entity6 did not want to pander to profits or market research , instead just wanting to focus on making great designs and products			1
he said : ' i refute that design is important			0
good design - innovation - is really hard			1
' really great design is hard			2
good is the enemy of great			1
competent design is not too much of a stretch			1
but if you are trying to do something new , you have challenges on so many axes			0
' we say no to a lot of things that we want to do and are intrigued by so that we only work on a manageable amount of products and can invest an incredible amount of care on each of them			0
' explaining his inner processes , sir @entity5 , who was knighted this year , said : ' we have been , on a number of occasions , preparing for mass production and in a room and realised we are talking a little too loud about the virtues of something			2
' that to me is always the danger , if i 'm trying to talk a little too loud about something and realising i 'm trying to convince myself that something 's good			0
' you have that horrible , horrible feeling deep down in your tummy and you know that it 's okay but it 's not great			0
and i think some of the bravest things we 've ever done are really at that point when you say : " that 's good and it 's competent , but it 's not great "			2
' the phone that made @entity6 the biggest tech company on the planet : the @entity8 changed everything @entity5 also said that market research was never @entity6 's way : ' it will guarantee mediocrity and will only work out whether you are going to offend anyone			1
' @entity5 joined @entity6 in 1992 , when the company was struggling and @entity98 had been forced out of the company			1
but @entity98 spotted @entity5 's eye for detail and minimalist yet ambitious styles , and between them worked together to make technological history			2
but as @entity5 said , the process was about making ' the best possible products that we can , that genuinely means saying no because we do n't believe it 's good enough			2
' instead , he and @entity98 would sit for hours in @entity5 's workshop , hunched over various prototypes , discussing the tiniest details on each before deciding on to the finished product			0
and from those meetings , the result was a revolution in the smartphone world .			0

technical *hurdles* - such as what happens when a *touchscreen* *grazes* your ear - nearly led to @entity6 *scrapping* the device of the *century*
@entity5 tells *conference* : ' good is the enemy of great . competent design is not too much of a stretch '
