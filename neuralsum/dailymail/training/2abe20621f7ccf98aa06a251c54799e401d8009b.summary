a soldier who returned home for the holidays to spend time with his wife and newborn baby has been told that he will have to stay elsewhere after the landlord said that he would be breaking the terms of his wife 's lease			1
sergeant @entity10 is stationed in @entity11 , but his wife lives in @entity13 , @entity14 with their newborn baby girl			1
however , the landlord of the apartment is forcing sergeant @entity10 to leave his wife 's home because he would be overstaying the time allowed for visitors			1
she gave birth to their daughter two weeks ago rules are rules : the landlord at @entity41 apartment complex in @entity13 told him he had overstayed , saying visitors are not allowed to stay in the apartments past seven days , per the agreement signed by @entity10 ’s wife an agreement signed by his wife @entity28 , stated that guests can only stay in the residence for up to a week - but no longer			2
' i 'm stationed in @entity11 and we have n't seen each other in six months			0
what 's the problem with me staying and visiting with my wife ? ' sergeant @entity10 said			2
the landlord , whose name is @entity60 , told @entity61 he enforces the same rule for all his tenants			0
the problem occurs because sergeant @entity10 's name is not on the lease that his wife signed			2
the fact he is a visiting spouse makes absolutely no difference and the landlord has made it very clear that there will be consequences if she disobeys			0
common sense : lawyers say the landlord would have a hard time pressing charges , since the person visiting is the tenant ’s husband sleep outside ! @entity83 ’s name is not on the lease , even though he is a spouse visiting , the landlord said he is not allowed to stay the landlord has said that he has the power to press charges and even double his wife 's rent if he stays in the apartment			1
' he stated to me that he did n't care about our situation , he did n't care about me being in the military , ' sergeant @entity10 said			0
legal experts believe the landlord would have a hard time evicting mrs @entity83 , especially since it is her husband who would be staying and not some other guest that she could be earning something from .			0

sergeant @entity10 is stationed in @entity11 , but his wife lives in @entity14 with their newborn baby girl
