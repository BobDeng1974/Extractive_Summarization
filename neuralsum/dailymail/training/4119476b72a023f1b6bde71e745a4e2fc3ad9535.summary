by @entity0 anger : @entity2 was given a 15 - month suspended sentence in april for abusing young girls , but @entity6 judges refused to increase it today a renowned gymnastics coach who abused students as young as six over 40 years has avoided jail for the second time			1
@entity12 ' @entity11 , 66 , admitted attacking girls at schools and gyms across the country , but was given a 15 - month suspended prison sentence in april after a judge said he had shown remorse			1
the pensioner , who served on a committee planning @entity21 , admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual activity with a child			2
his victims were outraged and the @entity28 then appealed to try to get him thrown in jail			0
but three senior judges at @entity33 's @entity32 have now rejected a bid by the solicitor general , @entity35 , to jail @entity2 at the second time of asking and to increase his sentence , because they believed his 15 - month suspended term ' was not unduly lenient			1
' speaking after the hearing , one of @entity2 's victims and her family slammed the courts for ' favouring ' the abuser over those he had ' scarred for the rest of their lives '			1
during the @entity32 hearing @entity49 , who was among the three judges considering the @entity28 's application , said @entity2 's shining reputation was ' shattered ' after it emerged he had molested seven girls between the early 1970s and 2010 , often using coaching sessions as a cover for his abuse			1
the appeal judge said the @entity59 lifted the leotards of some girls , rubbing and touching their genitals , grabbing one 's bottom and molesting another while she performed a handstand			2
lady justice @entity49 said one of @entity2 's first victims said she was terrified of telling anyone of his unwanted advances ' because he was her coach and others trusted him			1
' @entity2 , of @entity72 , in south - east @entity33 , made one gymnast sit on his lap and rubbed her groin , saying ' these were the muscles which she needed to work on ' , before patting her bottom , the appeal judge said			1
referring to statements made by his victims , @entity49 said : ' some endure difficulties still in trusting men and , in general , each victim feels that her personal relationships have been affected by what she has had to endure			0
' decision : judges at the @entity6 ( pictured ) said the sentence was not ' unduly lenient ' , to the fury of the gymnastic teacher 's victims when sentencing him april , judge @entity94 spared @entity2 jail , suspending his sentence for two years after saying his case called for ' mercy ' from the court			1
@entity102 , for the solicitor general , argued that the judge ought to have imposed a term above two years - which would have excluded the possibility of a suspension			2
he said : ' @entity2 was entrusted to be with these young girls by their families to benefit them through gymnastics training			0
it was , as the sentencing judge recognised , a gross breach of trust and this was not reflected in the sentence imposed			0
' mr @entity102 said @entity2 had since received a caution for witness intimidation after writing a letter to one of his victims after proceeedings			2
but while mr @entity121 , for @entity122 , accepted the sentence was short , he denied it was excessively soft			0
he said : ' a total of 15 months was arguably somewhat on the lenient side but not unduly so			1
further , there was indeed sufficient mitigation before the judge to justify her decision to make the suspended sentence order she did			1
' backing : lady justice @entity49 agreed with the first judge , judge @entity94 , and said : ' we are not inclined to disturb the 15 months on which this judge settled ' the barrister said @entity2 suffered from a heart condition and psychological problems as a result of the proceedings and argued his mitigation ' outweighed ' the aggravating factors of the case			1
' he is a broken man and i do n't think he will ever recover			0
he has lost his life 's work and , as the sentencing judge accepted quite openly , that , in some sense , was a severe sentence in itself , ' mr @entity121 added			0
application : the solicitor general , @entity35 , failed in the attempt to have @entity2 's sentenced increased @entity49 , sitting with mr justice @entity154 and judge @entity155 , rejected claims that the length of sentence was simply too short			1
' whilst some judges might well have imposed a term of more than 15 months , we are not inclined to disturb the 15 months on which this judge settled , ' she added			1
the appeal judge admitted the court had ' struggled ' to decide whether @entity2 should have been caged but ultimately rejected the solicitor general 's challenge against the suspension			1
' after significant anxiety , we have concluded that the term of 15 months suspended for two years was not unduly lenient , ' she concluded			1
speaking after the hearing , one of @entity2 's victims said she felt let down by the justice system after watching the paedophile twice walk free			2
she said : ' i do n't think i would come forward and complain again			0
' it is nothing to do with what the police have done , but the judges - they favour the abusers rather than the people who have been abused			2
' her mother slammed the decision , saying she felt furious that @entity2 was free to walk the streets after inflicting so much pain and suffering on his victims			2
she said : ' this is going to affect others who want to come forward			0
they are going to reference this case and refuse to come forward and another paedophile is going to get away with it again			0
' we could have taken this into our own hands			0
if my husband had done that , he would have gone to prison			0
we have tried to do the right thing and this is what happens			0
' the victim 's father added : ' i feel sorry for the police trying to catch these people and bring them to court			0
they have got @entity122 bang to rights and then he gets away with it			0
these girls have been scarred for life			0
