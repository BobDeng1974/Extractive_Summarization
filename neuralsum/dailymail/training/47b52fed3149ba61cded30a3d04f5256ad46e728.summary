by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 13 december 2013 it seems like the holiday season starts earlier every year , with @entity3 lights on store shelves in october , and carols on the radio before @entity7			0
but for @entity10 chef @entity9 , the season started even earlier than most , last february			0
that 's when he started constructing @entity12 , the entirely edible gingerbread village recently deemed the world 's largest by @entity15			1
( the world 's largest gingerbread house went to a construction in @entity19 that did n't qualify for the edible prize since the frame was made of wood			1
) the 1.5 ton cookie construction currently spans 300 - square - feet at the @entity24 in @entity25			1
for perspective , that 's as heavy as a large hippopotamus and the size as a two - car garage			0
he says he 's spent a ' few grand ' on the project , buying 400 pounds of candy , ingredients for 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing			1
unsurprisingly the cookie construction packs quite the calorie count			2
the dough is the the most dangerous with over 958,000 calories , the decorators icing amounts to around 423,000 and if all 400 pounds of candy were from candy canes , that would mean nearly 699,000 calories			1
mr @entity9 says he saves money by buying ingredients anytime he 's out of the city , cleaning out rural supermarkets of flour , candy and sugar			0
making the gingerbread village came second to his job as the executive chef at the @entity68 at the @entity69 , and most of the baking and construction took place after midnight while his wife was asleep			1
ongoing project : mr @entity35 started assembling the village as a whole this fall when he began driving the 164 structures from his apartment to the space in @entity25			1
he continues to add to it even midway through december ' my wife likes the fact that i work on it at home and i 'm not out gambling or drinking , ' he told the @entity88			0
it was n't until this fall that mr @entity35 started driving the 164 structures stored in his apartment 's empty bedroom to the @entity93 for assembly in the days leading up to the november 17 opening			2
and he continues to add to the structure even midway into december			0
the artist 's mother , @entity97 , calls her son a ' gingerbread @entity99 ' and told the @entity88 that his obsession with @entity3 started at a young age when he would string 10,000 @entity3 lights outside their house			0
admirers : @entity106 accompanies @entity107 , 8 , and @entity108 , 9 , as they look at the @entity12 , on december 12 his focus on gingerbread as a medium came when he was a teenager , and he lost a competition in his hometown of @entity115 , @entity116			2
since then , he 's been trying to make up for that initial loss , making bigger and better constructions each year as he moved around the country , from @entity120 to @entity121			2
last january he moved to @entity122 with the express purpose of getting more attention for his gingerbread making , and hopefully turning the hobby into a full - time career making and teaching gingerbread architecture			1
not for the calorie counter : mr @entity35 says he spent a ' few grand ' on the project which is made of 400 pounds of candy , 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 of icing ' being a chef , people may remember my meals for a day or two , but with the gingerbread , i can get thousands of people at a time to checkout out my work , ' he said			1
' i 've gotten emails a year later , thanking me for it			0
' @entity12 can be viewed at the @entity146 in @entity25 until january 12 - the day it will be disassembled and visitors can take pieces of the village home with them to eat			1
those pieces baked in early february might be a little stale though			0
mr @entity9 also has another gingerbread village in the city this winter , at the @entity68			0
it 's three stories high with 75 structures and he 's been baking it out of the hotel 's kitchen			0
tasty : @entity12 will be on view until january 12 when it will be dissembled and visitors can take pieces of the houses home with them to snack on			2

@entity12 was deemed the world 's largest edible gingerbread village by @entity15
the cookie construction is on view at the @entity24 in @entity25 until january 12
it is made out of 400 pounds of candy , 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing
chef @entity35 baked and constructed the villages 164 buildings in his apartment for the past year
he hopes to turn gingerbread into a full - time job , teaching and making similar constructions for a living
