@entity9 understands discussions are virtually finalised for the summer showdown , with a formal announcement of the fight expected imminently			0
elements of the deal are still being rubber - stamped and @entity3 â€™s @entity16 world title is unlikely to be on the line			2
however , the fight , which will be staged in @entity18 , @entity19 , will run over the 12 - round distance			0
@entity5 boxer @entity2 ( left ) is in line to take on @entity3 on june 20 @entity3 ( right ) has won all of his 24 bouts but has not fought since defeating @entity24 in november it is a huge opportunity for @entity2 but an even bigger task against a fighter who outclassed @entity28 in 2011			2
@entity2 , 32 , has lost back - to - back world title challenges in @entity30 against @entity31 , albeit in controversial circumstances in the first of those fights when a wide decision was handed to @entity31 from a close bout			1
@entity2 has lost his last two world title challenges to @entity31 ( left ) of @entity30 @entity3 defeated @entity28 in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats @entity2 @entity2 's hope this time round will be that @entity3 , usually so slick and brilliantly accurate , has diminished through inactivity			1
