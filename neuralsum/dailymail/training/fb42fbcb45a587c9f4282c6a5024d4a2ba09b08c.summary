by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 16:19 est , 5 october 2012 when his father died in march after a long struggle with @entity4 , @entity1 felt as if his world had ended			1
the former factory worker had sacrificed his job and much of his free time to spend three years caring for his father , and did n’t know how to get his life back on track			1
but now mr @entity1 , 56 , from @entity11 , says he has finally had his spirits lifted after winning the @entity14 ’s @entity13			1
this beautiful 17th century thatched cottage , in @entity16 , has been won by @entity14 reader @entity1 , from @entity11 he said he was ‘ in absolute shock ’ when he received the call telling him he had won the 17th century cottage worth £ 340,000 in @entity16			1
he added : ‘ i ’m overwhelmed			0
at first i thought it was one of my friends pulling my leg			0
@entity1 said he was in ' absolute shock ' when he received the call saying he 'd won the cottage ‘ if you believe in fate , this is certainly it			1
i feel it ’s my reward for the difficult time i ’ve had			0
‘ it has been a tough few years watching my father ’s health slowly deteriorate , but this is some light at the end of the tunnel for me			2
it came at just the right time			0
’ mr @entity1 , who before now had never owned his own home , described the picturesque cottage dating from 1655 as ‘ something from a @entity42 card ’			2
it has three bedrooms , all its original beams and fireplaces as well as a summer house and hot tub in the garden – vastly different from the small 1960s semi-detached house in @entity11 where he lived with his father			0
the cottage , appropriately named @entity53 , has a pretty garden with a rockery , a partly walled terrace and a rose archway – a spot where mr @entity1 can enjoy summer barbecues with his five brothers .			0

@entity1 , 56 , quit his factory job to care for his father in his final years
winning the @entity13 *competition* was a ' complete shock ' and has ' finally lifted his spirits '
