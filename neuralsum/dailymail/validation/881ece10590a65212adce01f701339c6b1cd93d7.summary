it is sometimes necessary for men wanting to attract the opposite sex to come out of their shell			2
yet it seems that by often choosing the bolder males , women may be missing out on the best possible mate			1
researchers have found that the shyest males actually have the most to offer a potential lover - at least in the world of hermit crabs			1
hermit crabs , like the ones above , borrow the shells from other creatures to keep them safe and new research has shown that those crabs that stay in their shells more often tend to be a better mate for female crabs professor @entity23 , a marine animal behaviour researcher at @entity25 , and his colleagues have found that the most timid crabs tend to more high quality sperm - making them a better option for females looking for a mate			1
this , they say , is because the crabs that spend more time hiding from the world inside their shells , also have invested the most resources in becoming reproductively fit			1
males of a species of hairy chested crab , which has been given a nickname @entity43 , spend their lives largely separate from the females , according to new research			1
in a study looking at the private life of the deep - sea crab known as the ' @entity43 ' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near @entity54			2
this , according to the @entity56 research , is because of the conflicting demands of feeding and raising young among the sexes			0
in 2010 , a @entity56 expedition revealed a ' lost world ' of deep - sea animals including the crab named after the @entity65 star thriving on the ocean floor near @entity54			0
using a deep - diving remotely operated vehicle ( @entity71 ) to examine the distribution , size and sex of these crabs at the vents , dr @entity67 and colleagues from the @entity69 have now pieced together their private lives			2
the researchers found that large male @entity43 crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep - sea vents , closest to the hot fluids that jet from them			2
smaller males tend to mingle with the females at the base of the mineral spires			2
it is an unusual approach in the animal kingdom , where the boldest , bravest and strongest usually win the right to mate			0
indeed , in many species males have to prove their physical fitness with bold and dramatic displays - like in peacocks and birds of paradise - and even mortal combat in some cases			1
writing in the journal @entity103 , professor @entity23 and his colleagues said : ' it appears that in hermit crabs , high - quality individuals that have invested heavily in reproduction , by making large spermatophores , are the most risk averse			2
' although we did not measure metabolic rate , a key process for the pace of life syndrome , this result seems counter to the idea that the most productive individuals should also be the boldest			0
' the researchers examined the ' personality ' of 100 hermit crabs collected from @entity121 and @entity122 in @entity25			1
they did this by testing the ' startle response ' of each crab by removing it from its tank , inverting the crab for five seconds , which caused it to withdraw into its shell , and then returning it back into the tank upright			0
the boldest crabs would then poke their heads back out of their shells far faster than the more timid crabs			0
on average most crabs emerged within 16 seconds			0
the researchers then measured the levels of a protein called haemocyanin , which is responsible for carrying oxygen around the crabs bodies			0
they found crabs that stayed in their shells longer after being startled tended to have higher levels of this protein			1
hermit crabs , like the one pictured above , hide in their shells when startled , but it also helps them become better mates this is because when inside their shell , the crabs are unable to access the oxygen rich sea water around them and so higher levels of this protein helps use the oxygen already in their bodies more efficiently			1
next the researchers examined the crustacean 's gonads and measured the size of the tube shaped bundles of sperm there , called spermatophores			0
again they found in the timid crabs , those that were slower to reemerge from their shells after being frightened , had larger spermatophores and so more high quality sperm stored			1
as they grow , hermit crabs like the one above , ' upgrade ' their shells by seeking out larger ones as finding the right home can offer them protection from danger but also give them a way of growing better stores of sperm professor @entity23 and his colleagues said that hiding in the shell when threatened may allow the crabs to conserve their energy for building up greater sperm reserves			1
it also reduces the risk of losing a shell in a fight with another crab , something that can increase the amount of stress a crab is exposed to			0
they said that in hermit crabs less reproductively fit individuals may develop boldness to help them compete with the shier more fertile crabs			0
they said : ' low - quality males may emerge more quickly in an attempt to maximize their chance of mating , or because they need to return more quickly to foraging , or through a combination of these causes			0

*biologists* at @entity25 studied how crabs *reacted* when startled
they found shyer crabs had larger packets of sperm than the bolder ones
it *contrasts* with many species where bold displays tend to attract mates
males in other species must prove their fitness by fighting or showing off
*scientists* say hiding allows crabs to invest more energy in making sperm
