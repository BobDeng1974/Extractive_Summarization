the fast food chain said thursday that it is making the move to counteract rising costs			1
menu boards with the new prices should start rolling out in coming weeks and be in place at all restaurants by this summer			2
executives have said in the past they were considering a hike of about 3 percent to 5 percent			2
that translates to an extra 24 cents to 50 cents for an $ 8 burrito bowl across most locations			1
it is the first price increase in three years rising tide : @entity3 's sales are up 13 per cent , and it 's prices are expected to rise by as much as five per cent company executives are convinced that raising prices will not hurt the bottom line			1
@entity28 , @entity3 's chief financial officer , said during a conference call with analysts that price is not the main reason customers visit its restaurants anyway			0
' most of the value comes from the experience , ' he said			0

' we 've still got room , ' he said			0
the decision comes as costs for beef have risen 25 per cent , according to @entity49			1

still , @entity3 said sales at established locations rose 13.4 percent during the period and it raised its outlook for the year			2
it now expects the sales figure to grow in the high - single digits , before factoring in the price hikes			2
the @entity67 - based chain 's popularity has surged in recent years because people like that they watch as they tell workers what toppings to put on their orders			1
the chain has also invested in marketing to build up its reputation as higher - quality alternative to places like @entity77 and @entity78			2
lowering margins : the chain blamed rising food costs for the first price hike in three years traditional burger chains have struggled to grow sales as customers increasingly flock to foods they feel are fresh or higher in quality			1
in contrast to @entity3 , for instance , @entity87 's has said it needs to focus on underscoring the value it offers			0

for the three months ended march 31 , @entity3 said net income rose 8 percent to $ 83.1 million , or $ 2.64 per share			0
that 's up from $ 76.6 million , or $ 2.45 per share , a year ago			0
