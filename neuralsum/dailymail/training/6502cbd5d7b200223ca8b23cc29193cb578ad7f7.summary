@entity1 's children are ballooning in size and perhaps no one is more aware of this than @entity5 , a school uniform specialist based in @entity7			1
he is now selling size 26 school skirts to children as young as 11 and blazers with a 56 inch chest			1
‘ nearly all of my suppliers are offering increased sizes and they ’re providing larger and larger sizes with every season , ’ he said			0
his shop is featured in the latest episode of the @entity20 , @entity21 ’s series about how @entity1 ’s bulging waistline is spawning a whole new industry of services for those who are so large they need specialist help			1
@entity5 runs a successful school uniform business in @entity7 but he has noticed a worrying trend in sales of plus - sized clothing mr @entity5 shows the camera quite how large the waist of a pair of ' sturdy fit ' trousers can be for the first time in history , obesity is killing more people than malnutrition			1
around 15 million @entity1 are obese and it is estimated that this will cost the @entity1 a staggering £ 27 billion by 2016			1
services touched on in the series include specialist shoe - makers who are catering to the those with fat ankles and feet as well as companies who are using military science to develop extra strong harnesses and hoists to mobilise those who can not move themselves			2
and in the latest episode , the issue of school children as young as five being offered plus - sized clothes is explored			2
with one in three children now classed as obese and 140,000 so large that they reach the adults recommendations for adult weight loss surgery , larger fitting garments are big business			0
in 2001 , mr @entity5 ’s shop only supplied two sizes of uniform - ‘ slim fit ’ and ‘ regular fit ’ - but now ‘ slim fit ’ no longer exists and has been replaced by ‘ sturdy fit ’			1
sturdy fit trousers are elasticated and their leg length and waist are in different proportions to normal trousers			2
their waist size is for children two years older than the leg length , meaning that trousers designed for a ten - year - old will have a waist for that of a 12 year - old			1
this style goes up to a staggering 50 inch waist			1
a recent study has shown the extent of children 's growth over the past 35 years			0
the data will be used to create a new generation of clothing to fit the nation 's taller and wider youth the best - selling skirt on offer at the shop starts at a ladies size 10 and goes up to 26			1
mr @entity5 says he has sold the biggest sized skirt to girls as young as 11			1
and on the day of filming , the shop assistant sells a blazer with a 40 inch chest to an 11 - year - old girl			1
now , 40 per cent of customers at the uniform shop opt for sturdy fit			2
five years ago mr @entity5 also brought in real adult clothes for children as young as 11			1
this means he is now able to provide blazers for men with a 42 inch going up to a 56 inch chest			0
uniforms as large as @entity115 are already an established part of sizing in the shop but mr @entity5 believes that to keep up with the growing demand for larger uniforms , companies will soon be offering @entity120			1
ironic : uniformed sportswear is now catering to supersize teens who need clothes for @entity125 lessons			0
currently the largest size is @entity127 , but mr @entity5 believes it will go up to @entity128 next year			1
@entity129 , an @entity131 weight management advisor in the area , is concerned about the rapidly rising number of overweight customers frequenting mr @entity5 ’s shop : ‘ around 70 per cent of parents are unaware their children are overweight			2
‘ when i see sizes like [ the ones in this shop ] i find it worrying and definitely , something needs to be done			0
‘ culturally , when we see someone who is overweight , they fit in much more now than a few years back			0
’ but mr @entity5 is n’t the only person offering children larger fitting clothes			2
clothing chains have been forced to rip up their sizing system for children to reflect the fact youngsters are now taller , wider and heavier than ever			0
a new template for those aged four to 16 has been devised for retailers to reflect the major changes to body shapes over the last few decades			0
six of the country ’s biggest children ’s fashion chains – @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 at @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 – are now using the guidleines			0
full body 3d scans were carried out on 2,885 youngsters across the country to produce the updated size regime			0
the last time a comprehensive survey of children ’s shapes was carried out was by the @entity176 in 1978			0
the figures were compiled by @entity178 , a collaboration between retailers , several academic bodies , clothing size experts @entity182 and scanner experts			0
girls of 11 were found to be on average four inches wider around the waist , while boys are generally bigger through the waist and chest			2
research has shown that over 80 per cent of obese children today will go on to be obese adults			0
childhood obesity costs the capital alone £ 7 million a year and if these children do not lose weight it is estimated they will costs the taxpayer £ 110 million in adulthood .			0
