father @entity0 has sparked outrage claiming it is often boys who seduce priests in religious sex abuse cases a friar has sparked outrage after claiming it is often the boys who seduce priests in religious sexual abuse cases			1
in an interview with the @entity12 , father @entity0 of the conservative @entity13 , said he did not believe a priest found guilty of sexual absuse should go to jail if it was his first offence			1
he even went on to describe disgraced @entity19 football coach @entity18 as a ' poor guy '			1
@entity21 , an influential voice in the @entity24 catholic community , has written several books and appears weekly on a religious television network			1
he said : ' people have this picture in their minds of a person planning to [ be ] a psychopath			1
' but that ’s not the case			2
suppose you have a man having a nervous breakdown , and a youngster comes after him			2
a lot of the cases , the youngster — 14 , 16 , 18 — is the seducer			2
' he added : ' here ’s this poor guy @entity18 it went on for years			1
interesting : why did n’t anyone say anything ? apparently , a number of kids knew about it and did n’t break the ice			2
' well , you know , until recent years , people did not register in their minds that it was a crime			2
it was a moral failure , scandalous ; but they did n’t think of it in terms of legal things			2
' ' if you go back 10 or 15 years ago with different sexual difficulties — except for rape or violence — it was very rarely brought as a civil crime			2
' asked to clarify his commenst he went on to suggest that most of these ' relationships ' are heterosexual in nature , which historically have not been thought of as a crime			0
he said : ' if you go back 10 or 15 years ago with different sexual difficulties — except for rape or violence — it was very rarely brought as a civil crime			0
nobody thought of it that way			0
' sometimes statutory rape would be — but only if the girl pushed her case			0
parents would n’t touch it			0
people backed off , for years , on sexual cases			0
i ’m not sure why			0
' i think perhaps part of the reason would be an embarrassment , that it brings the case out into the open , and the girl ’s name is there , or people will figure out what ’s there , or the youngster involved — you know , it ’s not put in the paper , but everybody knows ; they ’re talking about it			0
' at this point , any priest , any clergyman , any social worker , any teacher , any responsible person in society would become involved in a single sexual act — not necessarily intercourse — they ’re done			0
' and i ’m inclined to think , on their first offense , they should not go to jail because their intention was not committing a crime			1
' but father @entity0 's comments immediately prompted a string of angry posts			1
' poor guy ' : father @entity0 suggested disgraced @entity19 football coach @entity18 was a victim one anonymous writer raged : ' those comments on abuse make me shiver			1
i really really hope he does n't actually think the way he explained things in those answers			0
' @entity18 is a monster and the image people have in their mind when his name comes up is that of an evil pervert committing unspeakable acts on an innocent 10 year old in a shower			1
' another wrote : ' comments like this about pedophilia take the biscuit			0
i am disgusted at what i have just read			0
' how dare this prominent priest accuse abuse victims of acting as seducers ! you can never justify or condone pedophilia			1
it is a disordered and depraved act			0
@entity145 forgive you for your comments ! ' siginificantly @entity148 is a publication affiliated with the disgraced @entity151 religious order			0
the legion , which in 1995 helped saved the @entity12 from closing , was involved in one of the most damaging catholic sexual abuse scandals of recent times			1
its former leader , the rev. @entity156 , who had close links to @entity159 , had been investigated for a string of sexual abuse claims since the mid 1950s			1
in 2005 , the @entity162 was dragged into disrepute after it emerged @entity156 had been abusing seminarians for year			0
@entity165 - based @entity0 founded the @entity166 , which hot the headlines in 2006 after it emerged priests accused of sexually abusing children , were being given the option stay at the retreat under supervision .			1

father @entity0 described @entity18 as a ' poor guy '
