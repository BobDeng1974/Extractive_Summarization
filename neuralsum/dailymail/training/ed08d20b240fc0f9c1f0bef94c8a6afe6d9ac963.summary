seven years after @entity0 first decorated his white shirt , a young man from @entity4 was entrusted with the task of briefly upsetting some of his kith and kin			1
yet , when @entity11 returns to @entity12 on wednesday morning , a fifth @entity9 cap in his possession , he will surely do so with a heavy heart and consumed with feelings of deep regret			1
one of the more recent conscripts to @entity19 ’s squad , the 26 - year - old was granted his first start in @entity21 in @entity23 ’s injury - enforced absence			1
@entity9 striker @entity11 , pictured against @entity24 , failed to make an impression against @entity0 frankly , though , over the course of 45 minutes , the former @entity28 player did little to suggest the @entity9 manager would be able hang his hat on him in the future should the need arise			1
truthfully , it was a chastening night for almost every member of the home side			0
it proved to be a crushing low after the elation of victory over @entity40 on friday , with the only crumb of consolation that it did n’t come in a competitive match			0
@entity11 was by no means the only player to fall way short of the standard required at this level but as the only change in the home side ’s starting line - up over the two games , his shortcomings were all the more glaring			1
he lasted only until half - time before being replaced by @entity52 – with @entity53 pushed forward - and his withdrawal was about as inevitable as day following night			1
whether he is afforded another such gilt - edged opportunity is a matter of some conjecture			2
@entity11 expertly brings the ball down but only lasted until half - time before being replaced by @entity52 in mitigation , a chronic lack of service undoubtedly contributed to an underwhelming display but it was still distinctly cumbersome and uncertain			1
as @entity0 dominated the early exchanges , that settling first touch every striker craves proved elusive			1
when it finally came , the breath of @entity24 was on @entity11 ’s neck and the ball was smuggled to safety by the men in white			1
it set a depressing tone for the striker			2
those entrusted with the no 9 shirt in @entity19 ’s favoured 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , can find the position both a blessing and a curse			1
@entity11 puts his hands on his hips and waits to restart the game with @entity53 after @entity0 's opener when the wind is in the sails , the opportunities created by the three supporting players seem boundless			1
when defensive diligence is called for – as was often the case last night – it must feel like the loneliest of roles			0
even accounting for that , @entity11 generally struggled to hold the ball up and drag others into play			2
for a big lump of a man , his direct opponents were untroubled			0
to coin the old phrase , he seemed to leave much out there			0
brief moments of promise were invariably followed by a clumsy touch			0
when @entity109 or @entity110 stole a yard on the flank , the @entity12 man always appeared yards shy of connecting with a cross			0
when he attempted a reverse ball or a cross-field pass , his appreciation of the wider game was not what it should have been			0
the harder he tried , the less things came off for him			0
@entity23 may have failed to hit the net in what has been an interrupted five - and - a - half years at international level but @entity11 ’s movement looked measurably inferior to the man for whom he deputised last night			1
at times , he could n’t do right for doing wrong			0
one moment in particular summed up his contribution			0
having dropped inside his own half to instigate an attack , he showed a deft first - touch and held @entity132 off			2
yet , the subsequent pass to @entity134 was a yard behind the full - back and the ball trundled straight out of play			2
@entity11 keeps his eyes on the ball and manages to hold off the challenge of @entity0 defender @entity132 @entity19 , as we well know , just does n’t do hands - on - hips bystanders			1
it ’s one thing holding the position to create an out - ball but defending set - pieces was as much a part of @entity11 ’s detail as ruffling the feathers of @entity24 and @entity132			1
he did what he could in that regard , but in the real things that mattered – ball retention , playing others in , being an aerial threat – he rated poorly			0
and yet for all that , @entity19 appears to be very much in his fan club			0
a yardstick of @entity11 ’s standing in manager ’s eyes is n’t so much the fact he ’s now first deputy to @entity23 but the calibre of player he is presently keeping out of the squad			2
fellow @entity168 strikers @entity169 and @entity170 come with £ 8million and £ 11m price tags , respectively , on their shirts these days , yet the man who joined @entity12 under freedom of contract a year ago has elbowed them both out of the way			0
it will be interesting to see if he remains the blue - eyed boy for much longer			2
on this evidence , the aforementioned pair must wonder when – or indeed if – the door to international football will open again			0
certainly , both @entity182 and @entity183 , who were both given late run - outs here , have little to fear in terms of the competition nipping at their heels			2

@entity11 failed to make an impression for @entity9 on *tuesday*
former @entity0 under 19 striker was replaced at half - time
clash at @entity197 was @entity11 's first start in a @entity9 shirt
