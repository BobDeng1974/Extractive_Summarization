an unsuspecting @entity1 man had his pizza snatched by a passenger in a passing car - before a video of the ' drive - by ' theft was posted online			1
the victim was standing , holding his takeaway , at a bus stop in the city when the car drove past and a man grabbed the food from his hands			1
the group in the car then posted a film of the incident online , which shows the vehicle slowing down as it passes the bus stop so a man can lean out of the window and snatch the pizza			1
it is believed the man who grabbed the pizza was @entity40 , 28 , from nearby @entity41 , who had been on his way home with friends after celebrating a birthday			0
but mr @entity40 said he did n't mean to cause offence and has since bought the victim a replacement Â£ 12.95 pizza , delivering it to his home			0
he said : ' we were driving through town and just saw this guy stood at the bus stop , it was hilarious because he was stood holding it out like a waiter			2
it just had to be done			0
but police have hit out at the thieves , saying the video shows them driving dangerously through a red light ' when we found out who it was , we knew we had to replace his pizza and get it back to him			1
' we did n't mean to cause any offence , we just wanted to have a laugh , like prank tv			0
' a video of the incident was filmed from the back seat of the car , which appears to have four men in it			0
after one of the group says ' ready ' , the car passes the bus stop and , without stopping , the man in the passenger seat leans out and takes the pizza box			1
the incident took place at this bus stop ( left ) in @entity86 , @entity35 , @entity1 on saturday morning as a woman at the bus stop screams , the car then speeds up and pulls away as the group inside burst into laughter			1
mr @entity40 who took the pizza exclaims ' it 's a whole pizza ' and another replies : ' we need to pull over			0
' @entity93 have taken a dim view of the video though , saying the group appear to be driving dangerously			2
a spokesman said : ' as funny as those in the car seem to think this is , not only have they stolen someone 's pizza , it appears from the footage that they drove through a red light			2
' the consequences of ignoring traffic lights can be catastrophic and is absolutely no laughing matter			0
