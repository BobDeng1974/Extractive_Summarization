@entity1 sporting director @entity0 expects @entity2 to join @entity3 after they agreed to pay his buyout clause of £ 8million			1
@entity0 said : ' it seems that @entity3 is willing to pay the clause			2
we are waiting to see the money ( paid into ) the league			0
' we are not going to negotiate with anyone			0
two months ago we talked about his renewal , but it was not possible			0
show me the money : @entity3 have been told they must pay £ 8million to sign @entity2 from @entity1 international : the 27 - year - old @entity2 has played for @entity16 , representing his nation on two occasions ' when an @entity21 team appears interested in one of our players it is difficult because they can multiply player salaries			2
' the former under - 20 @entity27 international can play in holding midfield but it ’s in the centre of defence that he makes best use of his impressive 6ft 4ins frame and where he helped @entity1 to @entity35 glory last season			1
experienced : @entity2 stands at 6ft 4ins tall and he has made 179 appearances for @entity39 side @entity1 @entity1 signed @entity2 as a 19 - year - old in 2007 from @entity41 and his imposing physique but elegance on the ball drew comparisons with @entity46 at @entity47			1
injuries have not been kind to him since then and his career stagnated before @entity50 arrived at @entity1 .			0

spurs on the *brink* of signing @entity27 defender
@entity56 did not travel to the @entity57 with @entity16 but was a *key* player for @entity60 *winners* @entity1 last season
@entity0 says his club are *refusing* to negotiate but if the clause is met they must let the player go
6ft 4ins defender has been compared to @entity47 *'s* @entity46
