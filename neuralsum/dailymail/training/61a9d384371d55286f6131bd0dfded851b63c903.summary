by @entity1 reporter published : 23:46 est , 27 december 2012 updated : 07:39 est , 28 december 2012 it is not often that the president of the @entity4 needs to seek fashion advice			1
but when @entity7 was getting ready for a visit to @entity9 as a guest of @entity11 in june 1982 , his people had an important question for the @entity13 : just what does one wear to go riding with the queen in the magnificent horse country surrounding @entity17 ? the answer : something smart , but casual , of course			1
riding boots , breeches and a turtleneck sweater would do fine - no need for formal riding attire			0
historical fashion secret revealed : former @entity4 president @entity7 , left , asked @entity27 's former prime minister @entity26 , right , what to wear before going riding with @entity11 in june 1982 small talk : @entity7 chats with @entity26 during @entity30 at the @entity31 in february 26 , 1981 the fashion inquiry is but one tidbit contained in nearly 500 pages of formerly confidential documents relating to the @entity7 visit being made public friday by @entity27 's @entity37			1
the dossier shows the @entity27 government - led by prime minister @entity26 - to be extraordinarily interested in pleasing the relatively new president on his two - day visit			1
@entity27 leaders also fretted that perennial @entity45 rivals might triumph in the tug - of - war for presidential face time in a visit that had to be sandwiched between two summits on the @entity51 mainland			2
the papers show that top @entity7 adviser @entity53 had a way of annoying his @entity27 counterparts with last - minute changes and requests , and also surprised them with some of his objectives			2
@entity53 , remembered as a shrewd image - builder , said he wanted @entity7 to be photographed outside of formal venues , so he would n't be seen ‘ exclusively in white tie ’ at palace functions , even suggesting that @entity7 go to a village pub to soak up the atmosphere			2
powerful politicians : @entity27 's @entity11 , left , stands with , @entity4 president @entity7 , second right , and @entity27 's prime minister @entity26 at @entity69 's @entity68 , prior to a dinner for summit leaders on june 10 , 1984 there were raised eyebrows , and bruised feelings , when the @entity31 failed to formally reply in a timely fashion to an official invitation from the queen - the sort of invite that usually commands respect and a prompt reply the world over			1
the queen 's invite was left to languish for weeks and weeks , something that the @entity27 believe is simply not done			0
‘ it is really for the president to respond to her invitation , which he has not done personally , something that i have pointed out several times here , ’ writes @entity84 , @entity27 's ambassador to @entity85 , in a memo to the @entity87			1
‘ as you know those surrounding the president are not deliberately rude : it is simply that they are not well - organized and do not have experience of this sort of thing			0
’ @entity103 , a special assistant to @entity7 who was involved in planning the trip , told @entity1 that it is possible the delay in responding to the queen was caused by first lady @entity109 's insistence on consulting her astrologer before travel plans were finalized			0
‘ you have to remember that mrs @entity109 was very strict about his schedule , and she would consult her astrologer to see if this was the right time to travel , ’ he said			0
‘ sometimes she would back up departures			0
’ familiar company : @entity7 meeting with @entity26 during an economic summit in @entity119 , @entity120 , in june 1987 the documents make clear that @entity51 's leaders were desperate for @entity7 's attention at a time of high @entity126 tensions			1
a memo from @entity27 cabinet secretary @entity128 on february 5 expresses concern that a gala , summit - closing dinner at the palace of @entity132 outside @entity133 could delay @entity7 's arrival in @entity69			1
but he warns against pressuring the @entity7 entourage to skip the meal at @entity138 because ‘ that would not please the president of the @entity141			0
’ @entity7 's aides also worried the @entity27 by suggesting the president might have to skip the stop in @entity69 because accepting it might anger the @entity146 , who had offered a similar invitation			1
but feelings are smoothed over a bit when the @entity4 assure the @entity27 contingent that the @entity146 are not @entity4 's top priority			2
‘ @entity155 emphasized how much the president himself wanted to go to @entity69 , ’ stresses one confidential memo from the @entity27 ambassador , referring to senior @entity4 diplomat @entity155			1
‘ there should be no doubt about that			0
@entity155 also said that at the moment the @entity146 were not @entity4 's favorite allies			0
’ last dance : @entity7 and @entity26 dance during the final state dinner of @entity7 's presidency at the @entity31 in @entity85 , on november 16 , 1988 the prospect of a chance to relax from international summitry with a bit of horseback riding with the queen seems to have helped carry the day for the @entity13			1
asked for the president 's favorite type of horse , @entity27 planners are told simply that he wants a thoroughbred			2
he ended up riding @entity175 , one of the queen 's favorites , and wearing a perfectly fitted sports jacket above his sweater , going for an old - time @entity181 look he carried off with ease			0
much of the actual visit was devoted to pomp and pageantry , or to relaxation , but @entity7 did make one speech of consequence			0
he became the first @entity4 president to address a meeting of both houses of @entity192 and used the occasion to trumpet his distaste for the @entity195 , calling it an economic catastrophe			2
he said @entity197 would be left on the ash - heap of history - a prediction that would come to pass in the following decade			0
forever gone : @entity7 , who served as @entity4 president from 1981 to 1989 , died of pneumonia , brought on by @entity203 at his home in @entity205 , @entity206 , on june , 5 , 2004			1

former @entity4 president @entity7 asked former @entity27 prime minister @entity26 for advice on what to wear to go horseback riding as he was getting ready to visit @entity11 in june 1982
@entity7 's fashion inquiry is but one tidbit contained in nearly 500 pages of formerly confidential documents relating to the @entity7 visit being made public friday by @entity27 's @entity37
