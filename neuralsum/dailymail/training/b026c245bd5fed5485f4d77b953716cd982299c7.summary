he 's young , he 's @entity1 , and he 's a centre forward			0
but @entity2 is still underrated			0
' i have always believed in @entity2 since the first day … he has a very strong mind and is a very good player			0
' these were @entity8 manager @entity7 's words in august , and events since will have only strengthened his confidence in the 21 - year - old			0
@entity2 trains at @entity8 's training ground ahead of their @entity14 clash with @entity15 @entity2 ( right ) gives @entity8 the lead against @entity17 at @entity18 with a left - foot strike the @entity21 under 21 striker celebrates his goal against @entity17 - one of four in five cup games this season follow all the latest # @entity14 action on : @entity25 : @entity26 @entity27 : @ @entity28 and at @entity29 yet still , there is n't a frenzied hype surrounding the front man , who has four goals in his five cup games this term and six goals in nine caps for @entity38			1
a good thing ? perhaps			0
team - mate @entity41 's career has stalled since being heralded by @entity42 as the closest thing to @entity45 @entity1 football has produced			0
the fact @entity8 have two big - money , big - name and big - wage strikers in @entity50 and @entity51 goes against @entity2			1
but going for him is the @entity14 , a platform on which @entity2 can prove he deserves to start in the @entity54 over @entity50 in particular			1
@entity8 ' road to @entity56 could push @entity2 into the big time			1
his form on paper since breaking into the first team far exceeds that of the @entity60 's , a £ 26million signing from @entity62 last summer			0
the @entity1 scores or creates a goal every 111 minutes in a @entity8 shirt ; @entity50 every 152 minutes and @entity51 every 142			1
@entity50 has been a major disappointment since joining from @entity62 for £ 26m in the summer of 2013 @entity51 ( left ) appears to be ahead of @entity2 and @entity50 at @entity8 despite his poor form @entity50 watches @entity69 keeper @entity68 save his penalty during @entity8 ' 4 - 1 defeat at the @entity72 kick - off : thursday , october 23 , 8.05pm tv : @entity75 from 5.30pm ( @entity76 vs @entity77 , 6pm ) @entity2 has also impressed playing behind the striker , but he has only ever started with @entity50 twice - both in this season 's @entity14			1
@entity7 may try it again on thursday evening against @entity15 on @entity75 , but in the @entity54 it is often one or the other			1
@entity8 ' indifferent form has forced calls for the youngster to lead the line in the top flight , and though comparisons to a young @entity89 may be premature , he is clever , astute and can score a variety of goals			2
there are still question marks as to whether @entity2 can be the lone striker in @entity7 's favoured 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation , but the doubts over @entity50 are far greater at present			1
many saw this as @entity2 's breakthrough year at @entity18 , but if he finds himself sitting behind @entity50 in the pecking order come pre-season 2015 , impatience could kick in			2
@entity2 would prosper with a start week in , week out			2
if @entity8 ca n't provide that , a move to a mid-table @entity54 club would make sense			2
@entity2 and @entity50 could start up - front together when @entity8 host @entity15 on thursday @entity8 manager @entity7 ( left ) insists he has plenty of faith in @entity2 's ability @entity2 nets another goal in the @entity14 as @entity8 beat @entity112 3 - 0 to reach the group stage the fear is that @entity8 are constantly attempting to cling onto the tails of the top four , and playing a 21 - year - old striker with just seven @entity54 starts under his belt is risky			1
the culture goes that if a player cost the club millions , he should be tried and tried over the promising academy graduate , no matter who is on better form			0
understandable , but @entity2 may begin to feel his qualities could be better utilised elsewhere			0
nevertheless , @entity2 signed a new contract in august , ' keeping him ' at the club until 2019 , and @entity8 are obviously keen on giving @entity2 his chances in short spells for now			2
and of course , a bigger stage beckons if @entity8 can lift the @entity14 this season , with the competition forming a gateway for the @entity133 for the first time			1
he qualifies for the @entity135 through his @entity137 - born @entity136 , but he ruled out a switch in august , instead pinning his hopes on a future @entity21 call up			0
he may not be waiting too much longer if he continues his form .			0

@entity2 has three goals in the @entity14 this season
@entity50 only claims a goal or assist every 152 minutes for @entity8
@entity2 , from @entity8 ' academy , claims a goal or assist every 111 minutes
some fans are calling for @entity2 to start in the @entity54 over @entity50
the pair may start together in @entity8 ' @entity154 clash with @entity15
the match will be shown live on @entity75 at 8.05pm on thursday
winning the @entity14 is now a gateway to the @entity133
