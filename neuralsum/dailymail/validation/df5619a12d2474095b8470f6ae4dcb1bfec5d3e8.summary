@entity0 could not have looked more despondent at the final whistle had the fans who tried to storm his dugout in the first half got to him , vented their ire in his face and made it crystal clear they felt that he was to blame			1
‘ i am responsible , ’ he said , looking as gloomy as at any point since he became @entity10 ’s manager in october 2013			2
‘ i ’m extremely disappointed			0
i was n’t expecting this to happen			0
but it ’s football , i suppose			0
’ it ’s football , too , that woeful form and defeats like these lead to managerial sackings			0
@entity0 ’s job prospects looked more dire by the minute as this match wore on			1
@entity20 striker @entity19 slotted home the first goal in the 16th minute to end @entity20 's goal drought on the road @entity25 ran on to @entity27 's long ball and beat @entity10 keeper @entity28 to make it 2 - 0 @entity10 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity28 4 ; @entity30 3 , @entity31 3 , @entity32 3 ; @entity33 4 ; @entity34 3 ( @entity35 46 , 5 ) , @entity36 4.5 , @entity37 5 , @entity38 3 ( @entity39 82 ) ; @entity40 3			1
substitutes not used : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			0
goals : @entity19 16 & 44 , @entity25 18 & 37 booked : @entity33 manager : @entity0 2 @entity20 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity48 6.5 ; @entity49 8 , @entity50 7 , @entity27 7 ( @entity51 64 , 6 ) , @entity52 7 ; @entity53 8 ( @entity54 79 , 6 ) , @entity55 7.5 , @entity56 7 , @entity57 7 ; @entity25 8 , @entity19 8.5 ( @entity58 82 ) substitutes not used : given , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goals : @entity19 16 & 44 , @entity25 18 & 37 booked : @entity49 referee : @entity64 7 manager : @entity66 8 @entity19 was a constant thorn in @entity68 to see more from @entity70 's match zone @entity19 and @entity25 scored twice each in a spectacular first - half goal rush to end @entity20 ’s scoring drought away from home			1
‘ that was good , ’ said their manager @entity66			0
‘ we knew we could hurt them on the break with our pace and we used it … i ’m delighted with that			0
’ thus @entity20 leapfrogged @entity10 and now look up towards safety while @entity10 ’s position remains precarious just above the relegation zone , no signs of revival in sight			1
the fans are revolting already , several of them apparently intent on launching physical attacks on @entity0 at 3 - 0 down			1
they were escorted from the dugout but other dangers remain for @entity0			2
the pre-match narrative anticipated a dour 0 - 0 but the result and manner in which it was achieved left that not so much turned on its head but stumbling dazed to the exit			0
like many home fans even before half - time			1
a shocking lack of goals has characterised both teams all season , @entity20 particularly			1
at the start of the day they had 38 league goals — between them			1
@entity10 now have one league win in 12 games and @entity20 have two in two , and three wins on the bounce in all competitions			1
@entity66 ’s appointment has had the transformational effect owner @entity116 envisaged and that many observers were sceptical would happen			0
@entity25 cut inside @entity31 before calmly slotting the ball past @entity28 for a second time in the 37th minute @entity19 extended the lead a minute before the break when he powered a header home from a @entity49 cross @entity19 celebrates scoring their fourth goal against @entity10 on saturday @entity20 had scored a measly 15 @entity128 goals this season before kick - off and an even more pitiful four of those away from home , in seven months			1
it took 45 minutes to add another four			0
@entity66 affected ignorance about the extent to which @entity20 had been goal - shy before his arrival			1
‘ to be honest , i ’d not taken too much notice of @entity20 before i came here , ’ he said			2
‘ but we ’ve not had trouble scoring goals since i ’ve been here … losing becomes a habit			0
’ @entity66 and @entity0 played together at @entity143 and asked if he had sympathy for his old friend ’s plight , @entity66 said : ‘ always			2
it ’s not good when you get beaten heavily at home			0
but @entity0 will bounce back			2
he ’s got a bigger heart than anyone			0
’ @entity0 ’s players lacked heart , application and attention as they were steamrollered by @entity66 ’s revitalised side before the break			2
in a sustained flow of one - way @entity20 traffic and atrocious @entity10 defending , the visitors put the game to bed nice and early			1
@entity49 set up the opener with a square ball to @entity19 , who side - footed with his left foot low into the net			1
@entity168 @entity66 , right , celebrates as @entity10 's manger @entity0 , left , stands dejected thousands of @entity10 fans left the @entity170 before the break as their side crumbled stewards and members of @entity10 's backroom staff attempt to stop irate fans getting to the dugout @entity10 fans attempt to storm @entity0 's dugout as the home side fell behind to @entity20 that brought to an end a @entity20 goal drought away from home that stretched back to december 2 last year : it had endured for six full league games and 614 minutes			1
it was something of a shock — and a source of joy bordering on delirium for their supporters — when @entity20 doubled the lead inside two minutes			1
centre back @entity27 sent a hoof the length of the left flank to @entity25 , who ran with it and slotted home diagonally			2
@entity20 might well have been three ahead when @entity49 , again , made swift , easy progress down the right and crossed , to @entity57			2
but @entity57 could only blaze over the bar from close range			0
the third goal came via a @entity53 pass to the edge of the box , from where @entity25 slalomed past @entity31 and @entity207 before slotting home			2
with a minute remaining before the break , @entity49 was supplier again from the right , this time a high ball with pinpoint accuracy onto the head of @entity19 , who nodded home past @entity28			1
the game was over as a contest			0
when @entity36 failed to appear for the second half , with play ongoing for three and a half minutes before he came from the tunnel , some wags in the crowd joked he may have feared getting back out there			0
in fact he had needed stitches in what @entity0 said was ‘ a massive cut ’ in his leg			0
by the time he arrived @entity53 , set up by @entity19 , had already tested @entity229 again			1
@entity10 ’s @entity230 and @entity20 ’s @entity55 both had shots saved			1
but @entity10 never threatened to get back into this , not remotely			0
‘ we ’re gon na win 5 - 4 , ’ chanted their fans			0
those who were left .			0

@entity19 and @entity25 *combined* to leave @entity0 's job hanging by a thread
@entity20 , who had scored four league goals on the road all season , doubled their tally inside 44 *remarkable* minutes
@entity10 boss @entity0 was confronted by angry supporters close to his dug - out just before half - time
