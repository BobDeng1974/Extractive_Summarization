by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:32 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 06:45 est , 20 may 2013 the @entity3 analysis warns an independent @entity5 's banking sector would be 1254 per cent of the entire economy an independent @entity5 could be plunged into a devastating @entity8 - style crash , the @entity3 warned today			1
if @entity5 goes it alone its banking sector would be 1,250 % bigger than its national economy , leaving the government powerless to act in the event of a financial crisis			1
the would also be ‘ significant difficulties ’ in guaranteeing customers ’ deposits in any @entity5 banks which got into trouble , ministers claimed			1
analysis by the @entity3 reveals how vulnerable @entity5 would be if voters back independence in the referendum in autumn 2014			2
however the @entity24 has already dismissed the paper as ' far - fetched ' and ' flimsy '			1
@entity5 secretary @entity26 and treasury minister @entity27 launched the report today , arguing that after independence the @entity5 banking sector ‘ would be oversized , with assets totalling around 1250 per cent of @entity5 ’s gdp ’			1
they added : ‘ by way of comparison , before the crisis that hit @entity8 in march 2013 , its banks had amassed assets equivalent to around 800 per cent of its gdp – a major contributor to the cause and impact of the financial crisis in @entity8 and the ability of the @entity8 authorities to prevent the systemic effects when it hit			2
’ when the crisis hit @entity8 in march , long queues formed at cash machines as customers scrambled to access their money			1
the cash - strapped island needed an £ 8.5billion package to bailout its lenders , but savers with more than £ 85,000 in its banks were told they would lose 40 per cent of their money under conditions imposed by the @entity63			1
the new @entity3 analysis also warns that the 2008 taxpayer - funded bailout of @entity67 - based @entity66 was only possible with the financial backing of the whole of the @entity70			2
the @entity72 spent £ 45 billion recapitalising @entity66 in order to protect the deposits and savings of thousands of households and businesses , the report says			0
the bank also received £ 275 billion of state support in the form of guarantees and funding			0
these bailouts alone would have been 211 per cent of @entity5 ’s gdp , including the geographical share of @entity85			2
‘ as a range of independent commentators have noted , @entity5 would not have been able to afford such interventions alone			1
‘ other countries such as @entity90 , @entity91 and more recently @entity8 were unable to absorb the implications of the financial crisis on their own			0
’ the new study on the impact of independence on financial services and banking , also states that @entity5 could have ‘ significant difficulties ’ providing protection which would match schemes such as the @entity70 's @entity102 ( @entity102 ) which protects deposits in @entity70 banks up to £ 85,000			1
it also states that members of defined benefit pension schemes would not be covered by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , with an independent @entity5 required to provide such protection through a similar guarantee fund under @entity63 rules			0
queues formed at cash machines in @entity8 when uncertainty over a bailout for the island 's banks caused panic among savers in march this year mr @entity26 said : ' there are a number of reasons why this country , and this city in particular , offer so much as a location for the financial sector , " he told the invited audience at the official launch of the document			1
' some of these factors may not be impacted by @entity5 becoming independent , like the excellent universities here or the lifestyle opportunity on offer , especially right here in @entity67			0
' but @entity67 and @entity5 offer even more as a place to do business as part of the @entity70			0
' the paper is the third in a series of reports assessing the impact of a yes vote in 2014			0
@entity5 secretary @entity26 said @entity5 offered more as a place to do business as part of the @entity70 it argues that the @entity70 can afford to compensate savers if banks get into difficulties , as they did during the 2008 collapse , but an independent @entity5 would be required to set up its own deposit guarantee scheme rather than share existing @entity70 schemes			2
the paper says : ‘ the @entity72 lent around £ 20 billion to the @entity102 during the recent financial crisis			0
under @entity157 law an independent @entity5 state would not be able to ' share ' the @entity70 's deposit guarantee scheme , such that it covered firms authorised in both @entity5 and the continuing @entity70			0
‘ the retail deposit market in a separate @entity5 would be dominated by only two large banks ( @entity66 and @entity163 ) and , if one of these were to fail , the costs for compensating the depositors would fall almost entirely on the one remaining bank			0
’ it continues : ‘ if @entity5 were to be become independent , it could create particular difficulties for the @entity102			0
in an independent @entity5 state , @entity102 - eligible deposits held by @entity5 firms ( and which would therefore be covered by the @entity5 compensation scheme ) would be over 100 % of @entity5 's gdp , representing a significant contingent liability of the state - and a much more significant proportion than in the @entity70 as a whole			1
‘ as was clear from the 2008 financial crisis , where there are doubts about the ability of the sector to meet claims through the compensation scheme , it can be necessary for governments to step in to guarantee deposits in order to prevent deposit flight			0

stand - alone nation could not afford to bailout troubled lenders
banking is 1250 % of @entity5 economy compared with *700* % in @entity8
queues formed at cash machines in @entity8 when lenders got into trouble
