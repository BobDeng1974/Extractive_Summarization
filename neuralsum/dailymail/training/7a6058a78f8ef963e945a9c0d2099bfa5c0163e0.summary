the @entity2 ’s official @entity1 feed was branded ‘ offensive ’ yesterday after a quip about gay marriage and former glamour model @entity5			1
a user calling himself ‘ @entity7 ’ began the exchange by sending a question to the @entity2 ’s @entity1 account , @ c_of_e			2
he wrote : ‘ can i ask what @ c_of_e thinks about @entity5 marrying for 3rd time making a mockery of marriage yet you are against homosexual marriage			1
’ ' offensive ' : the @entity2 replied to a tweet asking what it thought of @entity5 marrying for the first time just married : @entity5 has just returned from honeymoon in the @entity24 with her new husband @entity25 ( right ) in response , the @entity2 replied : ‘ we do n’t have an official policy on @entity5			1
having said that , @entity29 gets quite a few mentions in the @entity30 ’ - a reference to the reality star ’s name in her glamour modelling days			1
while some readers were amused by the unexpectedly light - hearted quip , others took offence - illustrating the pitfalls of trying to communicate to the world in just 140 characters			0
in fact what followed was an object lesson in the point made by the account ’s strapline : ‘ we ’re here to learn and to engage with the @entity1 community and talk about some of the work we do			0
’ ‘ @entity7 ’ - whose profile adds ‘ it ’s me , @entity57 ’ and describes himself as a ‘ 39 - year - old sort of builder from @entity54 ’ - was initially positive , tweeting : ‘ oh that has made me laugh , i could almost forgive you on your stance on gay marriage but i wo n’t			0
’ ministers have unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following a legal ban on same - sex weddings in the @entity2 joining in sunday ’s exchange , fellow users pointed out that @entity68 - who last week wed builder and part - time stripper @entity25 , 25 , in the @entity71 - would not have been allowed to remarry in most @entity2 churches anyway			2
apparently recognising that offence had been caused , the @entity2 ’s @entity1 feed then posted to @entity7 : ‘ glad we could be source of joy as well as - sadly - disquiet for you			2
’ the @entity2 ’s @ c_of_e account has just over 21,000 followers - somewhat fewer than the 1.4million attracted to pope @entity82 ’s @ pontifex @entity84 language account in just over a month			0
last month coalition ministers unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following an unexpected legal ban on same - sex weddings in the @entity2 - an arrangement that failed to satisfy either gay rights groups or traditionalist clergy .			0

@entity94 asked what @entity2 thought of @entity5 marrying for the third time
@entity2 replied it did *n't* have an official policy on @entity5
but added that : ' @entity5 gets quite a few mentions in the @entity30 '
