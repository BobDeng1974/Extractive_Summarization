by @entity0 @entity2 's @entity1 made an early impression in the welterweight division at the @entity5 after wobbling @entity7 's @entity6 inside the first five seconds of the opening round			1
the @entity10 man rammed home a left hook which sent his opponent reeling backwards into the ropes , and fired the same shot early in the third to score a conclusive stoppage win			1
@entity1 said : ' it is great to get in there and when i knocked him down early it gave me confidence			2
i looked for it a bit too much to begin with but in the end i got him			0
' but there was disappointment for the first home nation boxer @entity28 , who dropped a split decision to @entity30 of @entity31			0
@entity28 was wobbled by a left hook midway through round two and despite a gutsy display he could not do enough to haul back the points deficit			0
@entity36 : @entity2 's @entity1 ( right ) got off to a flying start in the welterweight division in @entity39 cut above : @entity1 was too good for his @entity7 opponent @entity6 @entity42 's @entity41 , meanwhile , insists he will throw away his @entity5 medal if it is any colour other than gold			1
the @entity46 bronze medallist shrugged off a head cut to claim a unanimous verdict over @entity49 of @entity50 in his opening bantamweight bout			1
@entity41 's face was left streaked in blood after the third - round head clash but the small zigzag cut is not expected to compromise his future in the competition			1
@entity41 said : ' gold at the @entity5 would rank up there with the @entity60 because it would mean winning a competition instead of finishing third			1
wobble : @entity1 knocks down @entity6 during their fight at @entity39 's @entity64 aiming high : northern irishman @entity41 ( left ) will accept nothing less than gold in @entity39 ' gold is the only one i want - i do n't want silver and i do n't want bronze and i will throw them away if i do get them			1
on my day if i come in in the right frame of mind nobody is going to beat me			0
everybody has their off days , but i 'm not going to have an off day at these @entity5			0
' @entity41 was predictably too strong for the 19 - year - old from the tiny @entity79 atoll , and would have marked his opener down as a useful work - out but for his final round cut scare			2
the @entity84 man opened up in round two , clattering two right hands which forced standing counts and left the referee on the brink of stopping the contest			0
despite an increase in cuts since world governing body @entity93 voted to abolish headguards for men in the wake of the @entity60 , @entity41 maintains it was probably the right decision			2
he added : ' i loved fighting with the headguard but cuts are going to be dangerous when you turn professional so you 're better off learning now			0
boxing is just going to have to get used to it			0
