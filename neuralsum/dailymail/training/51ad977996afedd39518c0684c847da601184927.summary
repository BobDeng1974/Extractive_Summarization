horrified rush - hour passengers were trapped in a ‘ runaway ’ tube train which ran through four stations without stopping on friday			1
the tube driver told passengers on the @entity6 train that he had lost control of the train because a new automated system had ‘ overridden ’ his commands			1
it sparked safety fears with rail unions demanding urgent answers to what exactly happened and why			0
the @entity17 train took off from @entity18 on friday afternoon and ran amok after the new automated system ' overrode ' driver 's commands ( stock image ) @entity22 later apologised for the incident which it initially blamed on a ‘ technical fault with the signalling system ’ which they later believe may have been down to human error			1
it said the problem occurred because a ‘ do n’t stop ’ instruction given to one stricken but empty train being taken out of service was inadvertently carried across to a second fully functioning train just behind - which was supposed to stop for passengers			1
the saga comes just a year after @entity22 and its contractors were fined £ 300,000 for an earlier runaway train incident which the judge said had put lives at risk of a potential ‘ terrible tragedy			2
’ eyewitness said friday ’s drama happened at the height of rush - hour around 5pm after passengers were told to evacuate a ‘ defective ’ train at @entity18 before it was taken out of service			1
they then boarded another tube train right behind to take them on to their destinations			2
no break : the train passed four stations before finally stopping at @entity58 the second train duly set off and should have stopped first at @entity60 , but instead carried on through the station , then past @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 before finally coming to a stop at @entity58			1
@entity66 , 25 , from @entity67 in @entity68 , described how drama unfolded at @entity18 when the train in front of hers broke down			1
passengers from that stricken train transferred to hers and both continued on their way			2
she said : ‘ it was weird			0
the automated woman ’s voice on our train said we would not be stopping at the next station			1
then the driver came on and told us he did not know what was happening nor why we were n’t stopping			2
‘ then we went past three more stations and it was the same story			2
’ ‘ we eventually did come to a stop at @entity58 but the doors would n’t open			2
‘ the driver came on the intercom to apologise			2
‘ he told passengers they had got a new automated system and it had not let him stop			1
it had overridden his commands and not letting him stop the train at the stations			1
‘ he said they had been having issues with the new automated system			1
@entity22 confirmed there had been a ‘ technical fault with the signalling system ’ which they believe may have amounted to human error and apologised for the mistake			0
@entity106 had programmed the first defective train to continue without stopping to @entity108			0
however , they had then failed to rescind that instruction for the second train			0
so it too continued without stopping			0
it stressed no - one had been hurt			0
@entity114 , general manager of the @entity17 , @entity22 , said : ‘ i apologise to customers who were inconvenienced when they were unable to alight at their usual stops for a short time on a southbound northern line train this afternoon			1
‘ when an earlier defective train was taken out of service at @entity18 it was set to run directly to @entity108 without stopping at the stations in between			1
‘ due to this instruction this meant that the replacement train , which took on passengers at @entity18 , also passed through four stations without stopping			1
’ terror train : the @entity17 train was packed with commuters during friday afternoon rush hour ( stock image ) he said : ’ the safety system built into the signalling controls meant that the train was at all times kept at a controlled distance from the train ahead – pausing when the train in front stopped at each station then proceeding when it was safe to do so , this is a key feature of the signalling system			1
‘ the train travelled at a controlled speed throughout the journey without any risk to passengers safety at all times , however we are investigating why the instruction remained in place for the replacement train ’			0
the @entity155 rail union said a key concern would be exactly how close the train would have been to any train in front : ’ at that time of day at peak rush hour there ’s a train every three or four minutes on that line			0
we need to find out exactly what happened			0
’ in february last year @entity22 and its contractors were fined £ 300,000 for endangering passengers and staff after a runaway train caused chaos on the @entity17			1
a 39 - tonnes maintenance wagon hurtled through seven stations in august 2010 before it could be stopped			1
a passenger train in front of it was told to keep going and not stop , while commuters were told to run to the front carriages , the @entity172 heard			2
@entity22 , @entity178 and @entity179 pleaded guilty to endangering passengers and staff under @entity183 law			0
they were each fined £ 100,000			0
@entity178 and @entity22 are part of @entity186 while the @entity188 company manufactured the wagon and its tow - bar			0
judge @entity191 said : " there was the potential of terrible tragedy			0
he said the runaway train was out of control for four miles during 16 minutes			0
to those involved it must have seemed an extremely frightening eternity , ’ he added			0
the court was told that a fault had now been remedied and the incident was extremely unlikely to occur again			0
the @entity155 transport union described it at the time as ‘ a shocking incident which could very easily have resulted in a major tragedy and loss of life ’ .			0
