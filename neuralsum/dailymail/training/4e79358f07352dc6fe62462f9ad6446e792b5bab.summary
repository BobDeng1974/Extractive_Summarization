assistant employment minister @entity0 says there is no reason why all eligible @entity3 should n't be looking for work jobless @entity3 will be forced into working more for their welfare payments under tough new @entity7 measures designed to get the nation 's unemployed back to work			1
as part of a crackdown on @entity3 's jobless , the @entity7 will introduce the $ 5.1 billion job placement scheme from july 1 next year which will make it mandatory for all @entity3 under 50 , unless they are working part time or undertaking approved training , to look for work			1

those in the youngest working age bracket will be asked to work a minimum of 25 hours community service a week and apply for at least 40 jobs a month			1
@entity3 aged between 30 and 49 will be required to contribute 15 hours of weekly community service and those 50 - 60 will need to do 15 hours a week of an approved activity			1
those older than 60 will not have to do an approved activity but are encouraged to volunteer if they opt to work for the dole			0
@entity3 under 30 will need to look for a minimum of 40 jobs a month in order to receive dole benefits assistant employment minister @entity0 said it was ' most important that jobseekers look for work			1
' ' a job seeker 's primary responsibility is searching for that all important job , ' he said			0
most of the new arrangements will be put in place without introducing new legislation , however some elements of the $ 5.1 billion package will require new laws			1
mr @entity0 said he will negotiate with government cross benchers to ensure that the package is implemented ' for the benefit of job seekers and employers and to improve employment outcomes for people looking for work			2
' ' work for the dole has the ability to impart on job seekers the important skills to assist them in the workforce			0
' many employers , he said , are telling him job applicants are ' presenting at the gates to their business ' without adequate skills			0
' simple skills such as turning up on time , being appropriately presented , being able to get on with work mates ... work for the dole has the ability to impart those very skills			0

changes to wage subsidies will also be included in the overhaul of the welfare system and will be expanded for mature age workers , and extended to young job seekers under 30 and the long - term unemployed			1
wage subsidies are payments made to employers to help cover the costs of wages and training in the first few months of employment of a person experiencing barriers to employment			0
@entity118 accused the government of tearing apart the principles of the mutual obligation system			0
the new arrangements it claims will mean jobseekers under 30 will receive no welfare for six months but still be required to door knock for jobs			2
' they will not receive a cent , even if they look for work each day , each week , for six months , ' @entity129 spokesman @entity128 told @entity134			0
