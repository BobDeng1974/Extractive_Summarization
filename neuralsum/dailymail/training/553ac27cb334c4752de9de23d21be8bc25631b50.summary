millions of children are enjoying a ' bonus birthday ' each year - because their parents do n't want them to feel left out on a sibling 's big day			1
researchers found almost half of children are having two or more ' birthdays ' a year because parents buy them presents on their sibling 's birthdays , as well as their own			1
on top of that , instead of saving all the presents for the birthday boy or girl , grandparents and even family friends are getting in on the act and buying gifts for each child on family birthdays			1
gifts galore ! new research reveals that 45 per cent of @entity24 children get presents on their siblings ' birthdays not wanting the others to feel left out was the main reason for buying presents for everyone , as well believing it 's not fair if their children to have to sit and watch while their sibling gets to open everything			1
but the gesture has backfired for some , with a fifth admitting their children now expect to receive a gift on every single birthday a brother or sister celebrates			0
a spokesman for surveys site @entity43 , which carried out the research , said : ' it is astonishing to think that parents of today are more willing to spend extra money on children who are n't even celebrating a birthday , than teach them that on one day of the year it is n't all about them			2
' we know that the majority of mums and dads will simply think they are being kind and thoughtful , but the fact is that children need to learn how important it is to think of other 's before themselves			0
' and if that means allowing their brother or sister the limelight for one day of the year , then so be it			0
party time : parents also revealed that parties are planned to allow for the tastes of their other children sharing : some children are even made to share their birthday gifts with their siblings so no - one feels left out ' modern children should be taught not to expect presents all the time , and should be able to sit nicely and enjoy the fact their sibling is so happy on their special day			2
' the study of 2,000 parents found that 45 per cent of buy their children birthday presents on their siblings ' birthdays , as well as their actual birthday			1
and half of those admitted they ca n't bear the thought of one of their children feeling left out while their other child enjoys the birthday limelight			0
another one in three think it 's unfair to make the others sit and watch as one gets all the presents , while one in five said their children started to asked why they do n't get presents as well			2
but 28 per cent admitted that they simply did it as a treat once and now feel they have to carry it on to save disappointment			0
the study also found that 27 per cent of children will also receive gifts from their grandparents on a siblings ' birthday , while a further fifth are lucky enough to receive them from family friends as well			1
pressure : parents are worried other children will be upset if not allowed a share of the birthday limelight because of the bonus birthday presents seven in ten children now look forward to their sibling 's birthday , while a fifth have been known to ask for presents in the lead up to the event			2
and eight in 10 parents say they will continue to treat their children on their sibling 's birthday until they are old enough to understand that the day is not about them			2
but 45 per cent believe it is too hard for their little ones to understand they will receive less attention than usual			0
the researchers found that as well as getting ' bonus birthdays ' , a third of children are also being allowed to help their brother and sister with opening their presents			1
and when the birthday child has a party to celebrate , six in 10 parents will always make sure the event is appropriate for older and younger siblings to attend too			0
in the event of a party , 38 per cent of parents invite friends for their other children , while 45 per cent make their other children a special party bag so they feel included			1
the @entity43 spokesman added : ' at the end of the day , parents only want to treat their children equally , and as long as the children are n't spoiled for the rest of the year , what 's the harm in a present or two on a sibling 's birthday			0
' it just shows how kind and loving our respondents are , as they just want to keep the whole family happy and contented			0

45 per cent of @entity24 parents give their children ' bonus birthdays '
but a fifth say their offspring now *routinely* demand *expensive* gifts
even grandparents and family friends admit to buying extra presents
