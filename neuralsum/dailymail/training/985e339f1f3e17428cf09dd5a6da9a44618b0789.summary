by @entity1 reporter published : 07:38 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 11 january 2013 the oldest working fish smokehouse in @entity3 is facing closure after the owners were told they can only use smoke - free wood because of a single complaint from a neighbour			1
@entity9 has been serving customers with smoked fish at the back of its @entity14 shop for 130 years , prepared in a @entity16 smokehouse			1
but @entity17 say the practice must stop until issues with the smoke are resolved , after a neighbour in a modern apartment block lodged a complaint			1
family business : pictured in 1941 , @entity25 , @entity26 's great uncle , ran a fish shop in @entity28 , north - east @entity3 angry : @entity29 ( pictured ) , who runs @entity9 in @entity14 , north @entity3 is disappointed that he can no longer smoke fish in the smokehouse @entity32 and his son @entity33 , who were handed the notice on december 21 , face a fine if they do not comply			1
they believe booming house prices and over-development in what had previously been a down - at - heel area of town was killing off its history and traditions			1
six years ago , flats were built above a nearby supermarket and during the summer last year , a wooden studio - type building was put up next to the shop 's chimney			1
the council now claims the property - which had it chimney knocked off during the @entity55 by a @entity57 bomb - is in breach of the @entity59 and the @entity60 1993			1
the family believe the complaint to the @entity63 - run @entity17 in north @entity3 had originated from someone living in the apartment blocks			1
@entity29 , at the entrance to the fish smokehouse , which is in the backyard of his fishmongers shop not in stock : empty spaces in the shop counter where the smoked fish used to be sold before the traders were ordered to stop smoking it referring to the residents , mr @entity25 , 65 , said : ' we have never had a problem and we have been here 130 years			1
these flats are only six years old			2
' we have been doing this the same way for five or six generations back , and so did the people who had shop before me , they also did it for five generations			1
' if we ca n't do this anymore we will have to pack up			2
' his son @entity29 , 42 , added : ' it 's really disappointing			2
i have been here 20 years and no one ever said anything about health inspections so this was a shock			2
' the last e-mail we got was yesterday from @entity17			1
' we smoke with oak chip , which is pure wood			2
but they are saying it 's an unauthorised fuel and they want us to use a smoke - free wood , which is chemically enhanced			1
' but if it 's smoke free , it 's not smoked fish			1
' we use nothing but natural wood with no chemicals added			0
this goes against our principles			0
' to do what they are suggesting , we would need to have a completely different system put in			0
' @entity33 at work in his shop , although he is no longer able to use his smokehouse ( pictured right ) hidden away : the smokehouse , which prompted a complaint from a resident of a nearby property , is situated under the building with the green roof mr @entity25 ' father added the cost of the new equipment was in the region of Â£ 48,000 , and even then he was not sure the council would approve its installation			1
the family bought the shop in 1982 from the @entity139 family and also have a branch in @entity141			1
not happy : councillor @entity142 for @entity14 is fighting the case for the now unused smokehouse @entity29 said he were initially unaware that council officers had started to monitor the business since october , leading to the ban beginning on december 21			0
he added he had no idea how the monitoring had taken place , and they had not received any data			0
the family were able to complete their @entity155 orders , but the ban has lost them 40 per cent of their turnover			0
' to afford the rents and rate , we have got to have our turnover , ' mr @entity25 added			0
' we employ local people and have got six staff working for us			0
we are local people ourselves			0
' he added little smoke was emitted anyway as it was contained in the smokehouse so that it could be absorbed by the fish			1
customer @entity172 was also furious			0
he said : ' a supplier of excellent , healthy , locally - processed , traditional foods - commended by @entity175 and popular across north @entity3 - is being put out of business without consultation by ill - judged council action that can only be described as heavy - handed			1
' and , not so far away , near the @entity180 , a big new smokehouse has recently been opened			0
' but that was in a different borough , where perhaps " pollution " means something different			0
' what next ? a @entity17 ban on summer barbecues ? will firework parties fall foul of officialdom ? ' @entity14 councillor @entity142 has also backed the business , and is campaigning for the practice to be allowed again			1
traditional : inside the front of @entity9 , where smoked fish used to be for sale the furious @entity197 said : ' i 'm going to be working with mr @entity25 and officers to make sure there is a speedy resolution to this and to see whether the order which has been served actually reflects the intention of the law			2
' a council spokesman said advice on appropriate smoking appliances and approved fuels had been provided to the owner			2
he said : ' we are working closely with them to resolve the issue			0
' until then the owner has been asked not to use the smokehouse			0
' @entity217 , of @entity218 , has a smokehouse in @entity3 and uses oak logs			1
he said : ' we have a special system that prevents smoke from being emitted into the atmosphere			0
' the system is closed when we are producing the smoke			0
' not on the menu : thanks to a council ban , smoked kippers are not currently served at the family - run @entity9 fish shop ( file picture ) fish has been smoked throughout history for the purpose of preservation , although the invention of fridges means the practice is mainly used just for flavouring in developed countries			1
the market for smoked fish underwent a major change in the mid to late nineteenth century			2
the use of transport by railways and steam ships from the 1840s allowed the transportation of perishables , so large quantities of fresh fish could be moved from one place to another			2
this caused a decline in the popularity of heavily smoked products			0
in the same period ( the mid- 1800s ) , the smoked fish products recognisable in today 's market came into being			2
these are mildly smoked and dried and contain minimum salt as condiment			0
the kipper , for example , was invented in 1843 after considerable experiment , and remains popular today			0
traditional smokehouses served both as meat and fish smokers and to store the food afterwards			2
they are usually small enclosed outbuildings with a vent , a single entrance and no windows			0
inside them , smoke is absorbed into the meat during a process that lasts between five and six hours .			0

@entity17 said the historic custom of fish - smoking at a north @entity3 shop must stop until problems with the smoky smell were resolved
a complaint was made from a resident of a nearby modern apartment block
