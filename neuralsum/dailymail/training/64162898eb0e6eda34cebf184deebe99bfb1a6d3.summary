by @entity0 frustrated : president @entity1 pauses while speaking about the budget and the partial government shutdown @entity4 has mocked the @entity6 shutdown , telling politicians that they are ‘ sucking the blood of their own people ’			1
the comment was made by the @entity13 militants , who are embroiled in a conflict with troops from the @entity6 and its allies in @entity17 , in a statement issued on wednesday			1
it described @entity6 leaders as ‘ selfish and empty - headed for taking money from their people and ‘ lavishly spending the same money in shedding the blood of the innocent and oppressed people ’			1
the statement , according to @entity27 , said : ‘ the @entity6 people should realise that their politicians play with their destinies as well as the destinies of other oppressed nations for the sake of their personal vested interests			1
’ it added : ‘ instead of sucking the blood of their own people , this money should be utilised for the sake of peace			0
’ the conflict in @entity17 has claimed the lives of 444 @entity41 servicemen and women and 2,270 @entity6 troops			1
there was anger on tuesday over remarks made by @entity17 president @entity47 , who said that @entity41 and the @entity6 had done little more than cause ‘ suffering , loss of life and no gains ’			2
in an interview to mark six months before he leaves office , he said : ‘ the entire @entity56 exercise was one that caused @entity17 a lot of suffering , a lot of loss of life and no gains because the country is not secure			0
’ mocking : the @entity4 has decreed that @entity6 politicians are sucking the blood of their own people losses : the war in @entity17 has resulted in thousands of deaths for @entity56 forces he accused @entity56 of focusing on @entity17 villages rather than @entity4 and @entity69 ‘ sanctuaries and training grounds ’ in @entity72 and also attacked air strikes as a ‘ violation ’ of sovereignty			1
@entity47 was installed in 2001 after allies drove the @entity4 from power and he agreed that they should continue fighting			2
in the interview he also accused @entity56 on focusing their war against terrorism on @entity17 villages instead of @entity4 and @entity69 bases in neighbouring @entity72			2
no entry : a sign at the entrance of the @entity87 in @entity88 , which the shutdown has closed following his attack on the organisation , @entity56 ’s former @entity90 , @entity91 , hit back at @entity47 's critique , calling it ' unfair ' to the soldiers who have lost their lives to protect a country not their own			0
the shutdown , meanwhile , has pushed hundreds of thousands of workers off the job , closed national parks and museums and stopped an array of government services			1
president @entity1 and @entity105 , the top @entity106 in @entity107 , are pressuring each other to open the way for votes to end the government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit			0
the shutdown has been forced by @entity106 who oppose the @entity113 – or @entity113 – a healthcare reform plan that recently became law			0
they want to see cuts made to it , so are refusing to vote on the federal debt limit being extended until they can negotiate changes			0
the debit limit , currently at $ 16.94tn , is set every year by a normally routine temporary spending bill , but this year @entity106 are using it as leverage			0
without having approval from both sides on what it can borrow , the government has had to halt payments to various institutions and services it funds and , of course , lots of employees			0
@entity1 has warned that if the government 's borrowing authority is not extended by october 17 , the @entity6 will not be able to pay its bills .			2

the militants described @entity6 leaders as ' selfish and empty - headed '
the @entity4 is *locked* in conflict with troops from the @entity6 and allied nations
the shutdown has stopped work for hundreds of thousands of people
