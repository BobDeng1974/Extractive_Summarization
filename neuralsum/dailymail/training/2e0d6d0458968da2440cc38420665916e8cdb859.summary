@entity0 are persevering with their interest in @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity4			1
@entity2 has made it clear he wants to stick it out at @entity3 but @entity4 may consider what is on offer back in @entity9			2
both @entity9 featured in the team which were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity11 in the @entity12 on sunday with @entity13 captaining the side			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , moved to the @entity22 from @entity23 in january 2013			0
@entity3 remain in the hunt for another holding midfielder although @entity26 could also be used there			0
@entity29 's @entity28 is available as his club want to cash in now at £ 24m but @entity31 is expected to go to @entity32			1
heading home ? @entity4 could have been tempted by a return to @entity9 @entity35 say they have yet to receive a bid for @entity37 but wo n't let him leave for free next summer			1
the @entity39 is due to return to training at @entity35 tomorrow and will hold talks over his future			0
the added attraction with @entity29 's @entity28 is that he is understood to be on wages of around £ 10,000 a week , although his agent would obviously push for a hefty rise			2

@entity0 keen on taking @entity3 *duo* back to @entity52
@entity28 on @entity3 's radar for £ 24m
@entity35 say no bid has been made for @entity37
