car giant @entity0 is developing ' no death ' cars that drive themselves and are impossible to crash – ready for launch in showrooms within eight years			1
the computerised vehicles will be fitted with high - tech sensors and will ' refuse to be steered ' into other objects			1
@entity0 says they will be on sale to customers by 2020 , but that some of the life - saving technology will be incorporated into its vehicles even earlier – from 2014 – it says			1
he stressed that much of the technology was already being developed , trialled and tested at @entity31 engineering and research centres , such as at @entity41 in @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44			2
mr @entity32 predicts : @entity0 's head of government affairs @entity46 said : ‘ our vision is that no one is killed or injured in a new @entity0 by 2020			1
’ @entity51 - based @entity0 - now owned by @entity53 's @entity52 - said the first versions of its crash - free cars would meant for driving in towns at a maximum speed of 31mph			1
it is part of the race by leading car manufacturers including @entity0 , @entity31 @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and even @entity64 to build fully automomous ‘ robo - cars ’ that can drive themselves – like the one which actor @entity68 drove in the sci - fi movie ‘ @entity70			1
’ the biggest hurdle is not the technology which is largely developed – but public acceptance of it and and issues of who would be liable if a crashproof car did actually crash : the driver or the manufacturer ? @entity0 ’s mr @entity46 said ; ’ we have tested prototypes on thousands of miles of test drives on public roads in @entity84 and on the company 's test track in western @entity51			1
‘ the car of the future will be like the farmer 's horse			2
' ' the farmer can steer the horse and carriage but if he falls asleep the horse will refuse to walk into a tree or off a cliff			0
’ the 85 - year - old company - which has always prided itself on producing the world 's safest cars and developed the three - point seat - belt - said it hoped to launch the first vehicles in 2014 at speeds of up to 31 mph – for use in heavy urban traffic - with totally accident free vehicles at higher speeds by 2020			2
moves are already underway to amend international law under the @entity110 which would remove current blocks on fully autonomous vehicles			0
he convention , which underpins @entity115 and @entity117 law , says the driver must be in control of the vehicle at all times			2
new technology means that need not be the case			0
@entity0 has had 50 engineers working with automotive partners such as @entity127 on the new crash - proof car technology over the last several years			1
its prototypes have run thousands of miles of test drives on public roads in @entity84 and on the company ’s test track in western @entity51			0
@entity134 , head of developing @entity0 ’s driver assistance technology said : ' we are convinced this is the future and we want to get there first ’			1
@entity0 has built some of the collision sensors into its current @entity141 , and plans to have more advanced systems in cars by 2014 for sceptics who say it ’s pie in the sky , industry experts and bosses point out that the same was said of satellite - navigation , air - bags , self - parking car systems , sensors which ‘ see ’ white lines and keep vehicles in their motorway lanes , collision avoidance and autonomous cruise control that brakes automatically the car if it comes to close to the vehicle in front - all of which are features on cars sold in showrooms today			1
@entity61 ’s next generation flagship @entity165 which goes on sale next early year			0
incorporates a self - braking system that operates at speeds of up to 124 mph on @entity42 motorways , as well as in towns			0
@entity172 internet search engine @entity64 has also been testing its own prototype of a self - driving car since 2010			0
@entity0 is also working on a system to enable motorists to safely and legally read , send e-mails make phone calls or have a snooze while driving at the wheel under a new ‘ commuter car ’ system it has developed			1
it turns convoys of vehicles into self - driving ‘ road - trains			0
’ the @entity51 car maker ’s project permits lines of up to six cars dive autonomously almost bumper to bumper while driver switches off , does some office work , reads a book or has a snooze while letting the road - train convoy take the strain			0
each car ’s braking , acceleration and steering is instead all controlled electronically by a lead truck – driven by a professional driver - at the head of the line			0
the truck uses radio signals to control the cars behind it			0
all the vehicles are fitted with a special computerised control unit fitted to their engine management systems to tell the car when to accelerate , brake and steer without any input from the driver			2
once a vehicle is ‘ locked on ’ to the convoy a system of lasers and sensors helps keep the cars a safe distance from one another			1
the technology has been developed for @entity0 by @entity117 firm @entity127			1
drivers can signal their intention to leave the convoy and resume control of the car by simply pressing a button on the dashboard			0
@entity0 has spent the last three years working on the @entity235 project known as @entity235 – in a play on the name of the @entity239 existentialist philosopher @entity238 who famously and here fittingly said : ‘ @entity241 is other people ’ and ‘ man is condemned to be free			1
’ @entity0 has begun testing the driverless - car technology			2
here , a driver drinks tea as his car automatically drives itself , keeping a safe distance from the lorry in front it has been made possible thanks to £ 5.1million of funding from the @entity115			0
experts say self - drive cars are potentially safer because they take the risk of human error out of motoring			0
@entity0 says the car train is ideal for lengthy motorway journeys			2
not only do drivers make better use of their time , but the smoother journey cuts fuel consumption by 20 per cent .			0

vehicle will be fitted with sensors that can *detect* potential collisions and take action
firm claims ' nobody will be killed or injured in a new @entity0 by 2020 '
