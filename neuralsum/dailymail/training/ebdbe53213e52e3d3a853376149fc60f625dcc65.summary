by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 captain @entity2 is happy to follow the example set by his manager and do the dirty work if it means his side pull off a major upset and lift the @entity9 for the first time in their history at @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity2 was just five years old when @entity13 started his first @entity9 final against @entity15 , but grew up as a big @entity17 fan and came to emulate @entity13 's uncompromising attitude to his craft			1
and despite the plaudits heaped on the 29 - year - old this season , @entity2 insists he will be content for his team - mates to go down as heroes so long as the @entity25 can emulate @entity27 's unexpected cup win last may			2
celebration : @entity2 says winning at @entity12 on saturday would be the greatest achievement of his career learning from the master : @entity2 ( right ) is hoping to emulate his manager , who won the cup as a player @entity2 said : ' i 'd sooner our striker is man of the match for scoring a hat - trick than a defender for making last - ditch tackles every two minutes to keep us in the game			1
' recalling his days watching @entity13 and his central - defensive partner @entity43 during their @entity45 era , @entity2 said : ' i have lots of memories of @entity17 finals and i remember him playing and lifting the trophy as captain , and that 's something i want to emulate			1
' he was a hard man , the tough one and @entity43 was meant to be the ball player as such			2
' i probably have a mix of the two			2
i 'm quite long and gangly like @entity43 was , and i guess he was the quick one out of the two			2
' but i can definitely do the dirty and ugly side of defending because if you 've played in @entity57 there 's not a week goes by where you can get away without getting hurt , and luckily i got used to that early in my career			2
optimistic : the @entity3 captains believes his team can win and says if they do it would be ' the stuff of dreams ' captain fantastic : the defender has been in superb form this season as @entity3 secured their top flight status ' you can have ball - playing defenders who rarely put in a tackle , but clubs like ourselves need proper dogged defenders who can put their bodies on the line			1
that 's the sort of player i am rather than the creative , unlocking player			0
' @entity2 has been the undoubted star of the @entity25 ' first season back in the top - flight and was widely credited with turning the semi-final against @entity87 on its head with an impassioned half - time team - talk			0
such headline - grabbing interventions are a far cry from @entity2 ' early career , having worked his way up through the lower leagues where he started with @entity96 , the club who gave him his first professional contract in 2003			0
two years later @entity2 helped the @entity99 to the @entity57 title - an achievement he will still regard as the proudest moment of his career until he leads his side out in the @entity12 final			0
@entity2 added : ' if we win it , it will be the biggest achievement of my career without a doubt			0
up to now , my best achievement was winning the @entity57 title with @entity96			1
preparation : @entity2 ( centre ) shares a joke with @entity117 ( right ) and @entity118 during training career highlight : the @entity3 fans salute @entity2 after reaching the cup final by beating @entity87 ' i still believe that was a great achievement , but to win the @entity9 is the stuff of dreams			1
' it might be a great day out but if you do n't win it it means nothing to you			0
you just hope the walk up the steps is a happy one , especially with me being captain and potentially lifting the trophy			1
' people keep saying the @entity9 's lost a bit of gloss but as an @entity138 and a fan it 's still the best competition			0
' i always dreamed of lifting it for @entity17 back then , and if you 'd told me i would get a chance to play in an @entity9 final i would have run around like a madman			0
' the fact that it is now reality that i could lift the trophy is crazy			0

skipper happy to put his body on the line to beat @entity156
says winning on saturday would be ' stuff of dreams '
