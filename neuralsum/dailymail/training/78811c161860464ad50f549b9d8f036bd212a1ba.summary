by @entity0 @entity1 has defended its controversial new logo , claiming it will become as recognisable as the @entity4 swoosh			1
' it ’s just like : go ahead , laugh all you want , guys , ' said @entity1 co-founder and cto @entity9 at a dinner in @entity11			0
' we would n’t want to design a logo that caters to the lowest common denominator			1
the two firms told @entity23 ' in early 2014 both @entity1 and @entity21 began use of new logos that , by coincidence , have similar designs			1
' @entity1 are working cooperatively to address this issue , and @entity21 is in the process of transitioning to a new logo design that is not similar to the @entity1 logo			1
' the new logo , created by @entity34 design firm @entity33 , drew comparisons to various body parts now only because it did n’t have the @entity1 brand attached to it yet , @entity9 told a reporter from tech website re / code			1
' if you looked at the @entity4 swoosh , you might say it ’s a check mark , but once you understand the context , it means something else , ' he said			2
' the symbol is not supposed to be a symbol , it ’s supposed to be something with meaning			0
' the firm has even given a the logo its own name , calling it a bélo - causing more amusement on social media sites			1
' the bélo is a vehicle for rich , deep , emotional , human stories , ' the firm sad			2
@entity1 's ceo @entity61 said the logo was inspired by famous logos from around the world , like the @entity66 rings and @entity68 symbol			2
' we ’ve created a symbol for us as a community , ' he said in a blog post announcing the change			0
' it ’s an iconic mark for our windows , our doors , and our shared values			0
the firm has also launched an online tool allowing users to create their own version of the logo , which it says can then be printed on mugs and t - shirts ' it ’s a symbol that , like us , can belong wherever it happens to be			1
' @entity88 , the @entity89 - based team of graphic designers behind it , says on its website that the goal was to ' design a marque anyone could draw - something that transcended language and formed the foundation of a new brand			2
' @entity1 's co-founder @entity61 said the new logo represents : ' a symbol for people who want to try a new tea they ’ve never heard of from a village they could n’t find on the map			2
' it ’s a symbol for going where the locals go — the cafe that does n’t bother with a menu , the dance club hidden down a long alleyway , the art galleries that do n’t show up in the guidebooks			0
' it ’s a symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences , new cultures , and new conversations			0
' @entity121 user shaunpendy designed an infographic providing one possible explanation for how the logo came to be			1
in addition to people , places , and love , he said the final component was ' truck nuts			0
' user mbraaten hypothesized what the meeting to decide on the symbol might 've been like			0
in her scenario , one person says they 're all out of ideas , and another person responds , ' balls ! ' truck nuts ? @entity121 user @entity144 's logo shows one explanation for @entity1 's new logo train of thought : @entity121 user @entity148 hypothesizes what the meeting to decide the logo was like user isaidicanshout said it looks like ' balls and all sorts of other things			1
' finally , aaronpcalvin wonders ' what if the new @entity1 logo is neither a penis or a vagina ' as he smokes on a pipe , like @entity162			1
the logo took nearly a year of research to complete , and designers traveled to more than a dozen countries to interview @entity1 hosts and guests			2
there 's one way to look at it ! @entity172 tells his followers what he thinks @entity1 's new symbol looks like a good question : @entity177 waxes philosophical about @entity1 's new logo they also performed in - depth analyses of competing brands , from @entity182 to @entity183			1
eventually , their mood boards and research piled up so high that @entity61 said it looked like ' @entity189 's workshop in a beautiful mind			0
' as part of the reveal , the company launched ' @entity193 , ' a place on their site where users can make their own symbols that will be on their profiles			0
' behind each symbol is a story only you can tell , about your home , your guests and your adventures , ' the site reads			0
fly the flag : the firm is encouraging users to make their own version of the logo once you 've created your symbol , you can put it on ' mugs , thank you cards , and souvenir stickers			1
' the logo 's launch was part of an overall site reboot , designed to make the it cleaner and splashier			0
it all comes at an interesting time for the company , as they face legal troubles in big cities across the world for allegedly disobeying short - term housing laws .			0
