by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 09:49 est , 26 september 2012 a @entity2 website which offers ' in depth analysis ' and research is available to everyone in the world - except @entity8 licence fee payers			1
the @entity10 site was launched in february 2012 and is heralded as the new international technology , science , environment and health site from the @entity2			1
but if anyone in the @entity8 is tempted to read stories ' drawing on the @entity2 's global expertise and storytelling ' they had better think again			1
what we are missing out on : @entity10 , a global site including in depth analysis and research sorry : if you try to click on any of the stories from the site you are greeted with this message from the @entity2 the site is not accessible from the @entity8 as it is part of the corporation 's international service and is not funded by the licence fee			1
this means , that despite @entity8 forking out almost £ 150 a year for a tv licence to fund the @entity2 , they are excluded from the content			1
and without the funding from the controversial licence fee - the @entity2 would not exist			1
@entity42 , chief executive of the @entity44 ’ @entity41 , told @entity45 : ' @entity46 is only able to function because it is selling to other countries the programmes which were made using licence fee payers ’ cash in the first place			1
' those in @entity8 unable to access these services available to the rest of the world have every right to feel cheated			1
' but @entity46 say it is the same ' genre ' of content already provided for @entity8 citizens - though the stories are not the same			1
and that it is a ' wholly owned subsidiary ' existing to ' maximise the value of @entity2 content and key brands through exploiting them overseas '			0
a spokesman said @entity46 ' acquires content at market value , which is the same price for both @entity46 or any other parties '			0
@entity10 is described as a site that ' explores the global ideas and innovations that are shaping our lives and the world around us - now and in the future			1
' it provides ' in depth analysis of cutting edge research ' , according to the site 's @entity81 group			0
as well as @entity10 there is also @entity84 , which is another international section not available to those in the @entity8			2
if licence fee payers in the @entity8 try to click on stories provided by these sites then they are directed to a message which says , ' we 're sorry but this site is not accessible from the @entity8			1
' the compulsory licence fee has sparked furore in the past as the @entity2 has been outbid for rights to screen sporting events such as the @entity98			1
critics have asked why the corporation should be entitled to ‘ special treatment ’ if it fails in its duty to rise above commercial and rating considerations			0
complaints have also been raised over the corporation ’s coverage , its repetition of programmes and whether taxpayers in the @entity8 should get more for the money they pay			0
a wealth of content : from music , maths to crime and @entity116 , everyone outside the @entity8 can access it columns : those abroad can take a dive into the big stories in science , technology and health the @entity10 site offers exclusive content to those who are not paying the licence fee in the @entity8			1
stories on the site can range from anything maths , music or engineering to drugs , medicine and genetics			0
each week the site has a global thinker from the world of philosophy , science , psychology or the arts and puts forward a radical , inspiring or controversial idea that they believe will change the world - according to the website			2
and the service 's defence writer goes behind closed doors and writes about the future of national security			0
a recent story includes an exclusive look inside a high - priority @entity156 military project			0
the project 's mission is to detect and neutralise roadside bombs			0
and another is a feature on a man who lives in the coldest , remotest part of the world , a story that is linked from the @entity81 website			0
while @entity8 citizens can choose to ' like ' and follow the content , once they try to click on any of the stories , they are told they can not access it			1
@entity2 future facebook site that can see seen by people in the @entity8			2
once you click on the story though it redirects you away from the content a @entity46 spokesman said : ' @entity10 focuses on the latest trends across @entity180 genres			2
' it has been created for the @entity2 ’s commercial website bbc.com for audiences outside the @entity8			2
' under the @entity2 ’s @entity185 rules commercial websites are not allowed to receive unfair promotion from the @entity2 ’s public services			0
' this prevents us from being able to provide future content on @entity191			0
' it has been developed using commercial revenues , and not the licence fee			2
the profit from such activity goes back to the public service arm of the @entity2 to fund the development of new content			2
' @entity191 also offers users a host of interesting and thought provoking content across @entity203 in individual sections			0
' @entity191 was launched in 2007 to offer audiences outside the @entity8 an international version of the @entity2 's online site			1
@entity46 is a commercial arm of the corporation and a wholly - owned subsidiary			0
it aims to maximize profits for the corporation with the aid of advertising			0
in 2011/12 the company 's total returns to the @entity2 rose by 19 per cent to £ 216m , taking the returns to over £ 1.3billlion since 2004 .			0

@entity10 is a technology , science , environment and health site
explores ' global ideas ' and ' innovations that are shaping our lives '
@entity8 citizens ca *n't* access the site , which is run by @entity46 , an arm of the @entity2 , because it is an ' international service ' not funded by licence fee
without the controversial licence fee the @entity2 would cease to exist
' @entity8 have every right to feel cheated ' , says @entity41
