@entity1 president @entity0 told the @entity2 on wednesday that the @entity4 terror army has begun to infiltrate his country ' like a dangerous virus , ' and warned his fellow @entity7 not to be romanced by its ' anger and hatred			1
' @entity0 said @entity1 is the new ' frontline ' for the self - proclaimed @entity4 , which has been ' sending advance guards to southern and western @entity1 to test for vulnerabilities			1
' so far , he told a joint meeting of @entity2 , ' @entity1 's people have rejected the allure of violent @entity16			1
but sooner or later extremism will come knocking at our door			2
' he urged people in ' muslim majority countries ' to challenge @entity24 terrorism ' from within the religion			2
' ' silence is not acceptable , ' the @entity1 leader declared			2
' leaders , intellectuals , and those many millions of @entity7 who believe that @entity16 is a religion of tolerance and virtue must find their voice			1
' @entity0 insisted that ' @entity16 is a religion of peace , ' and praised the @entity63 world for its ' gloriously tolerant and inquisitive past			1
' his speech came against the backdrop of a spreading @entity24 radicalism that has helped @entity4 – which he referred to by its native name ' @entity70 ' – conquer large swaths of @entity73 and @entity74 teritory by leveraging a fundamentalist brand of @entity16 as a pretext for military might			1
that extremism , @entity0 warned , ' is becoming a system – one that , like a dangerous virus , is constantly mutating , becoming more lethal , very media savvy , well financed , and thriving on state weakness and an overall lack of regional coordination			2
' at the same time he thanked @entity34 taxpayers for supporting his country 's post- 9/11 resurgence and urged @entity2 to keep the money flowing – to a point			1
' i have no doubt that , provided that they continue to receive equipment and training , our armed forces will stand firm against any efforts by outside extremists to build a base inside our territory , ' he said			0
but ' we do n't want your charity , ' he insisted			2
' we have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to go out and find a job			0
' and in a throwaway line that was n't in the prepared text that circulated among lawmakers wednesday morning , he chuckled : ' we 're not going to be the lazy @entity115			1
' vice president @entity46 , seated behind him , could be heard on @entity118 's camera feed chuckling twice as loudly			2
@entity120 @entity119 sen. @entity119 , who chairs the @entity121 , said wednesday that the @entity34 has ' a vested interest in the ability of @entity1 to secure and stabilize their country after the investments of the @entity34 people and the extraordinary sacrifices of our service members			1
' @entity0 , @entity119 added , is now responsible for ' mobilizing a reliable , effective security force in a region where terrorism remains a major threat			0
' from the podium in the @entity40 chamber , the @entity1 leader agreed			0
' properly supported , @entity1 is uniquely positioned to block the spread of extremism , ' he claimed			0
' we have none of the historical inferiority complexes that fuel resentment against western domination			0
after all , we defeated most of the empires			0
' @entity146 ? president @entity147 said tuesday that he would n't order the quick military withdrawal he was expected to institute in the wake of the official end of @entity34 combat in @entity1 at the end of 2014 thank you : @entity0 thanked @entity34 over and over for supporting and stabilizing his country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , perpetrated by @entity158 terrorists who had taken refuge there ' with the bitter exception of the aberrant @entity163 regime , @entity16 has traditionally been inclusive and reflective , not violent and angry , ' he said			1
' and after thirty - six years of conflict our people are well - vaccinated against the seduction of ideologically based conflicts			0
' in a more dramatic departure from his prepared remarks , @entity0 paused to express his hope that @entity1 would someday become ' ordinary			0
' ' our people , our children , desperately want to be normal , ' he said			0
' @entity174 is what has escaped us , and we 'd really like to be leading ordinary lives : to go to school and come back , to shop without being blown up , to play volleyball without being attacked			0
' ' so many children have i held in my arms who have been mutilated , ' @entity0 continued			0
' that must not be permitted ! it can not be permitted ! it will not be permitted ! ' @entity0 faces the challenge of establishing @entity1 's military and civil self - sufficiency as president @entity147 supervises a slowed - down but inevitable drawdown of the @entity34 military forces that have kept the country from falling apart since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001			1
that deployment , initially ordered by president @entity194 to punish and contain the @entity158 network that brought down the @entity196 from its @entity1 bases of operations , cost 2,315 servicemen and women their lives and brought another 20,000 home with wounds and other injuries			2
' we owe a profound debt to the soldiers who have lost limbs to buried bombs , to the brave veterans , and to the families who tragically lost their loved ones to the enemy ’s cowardly acts of terror , ' @entity0 said wednesday			1
and more than a decade later , he pledged , ' @entity1 will be the graveyard of @entity158 and their foreign terrorist affiliates			0
' ' never again will our country be a host to terrorists			1
never again will we give extremists the sanctuary to plan their destructive plots			0

@entity225 spoke to a joint meeting of @entity2 on wednesday
said the @entity4 terror army is already testing his country 's vulnerabilities in border regions
key to defeating the terrorists , he said , is making it clear that they do n't speak for all of @entity16
also thanked @entity147 for ' *seamless* *handover* ' of military operations even as the @entity34 has slowed down its troop withdrawal
