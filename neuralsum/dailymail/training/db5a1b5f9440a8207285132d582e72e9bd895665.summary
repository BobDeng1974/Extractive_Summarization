@entity0 is adamant he will not step foot in the same ring as @entity4 heavyweight rival @entity3 in future after the @entity6 pulled out of their scheduled fight this saturday			1
the duo were set to settle their differences at the @entity12 in @entity13 this weekend , but @entity3 pulled out of the rematch , which was billed as a final eliminator for the @entity18 title , on monday			1
' as far as i 'm concerned @entity3 is history - finished , ' @entity0 , who also saw @entity28 twice pull out of a fight with him last year due to separate injuries , said			1
' after i 've done with this lummox in front of me ( @entity20 ) i want @entity25 for the @entity26 title			2
confident : @entity0 ( left ) has already set his sights on who will face after saturday 's bout with @entity20 ' i 'm not interested in @entity3 , he ai n't got enough credibility to lace my boots up , never mind step in the same ring			1
he 's a s * * * house who dropped his b * * * * * * s in training			0
' @entity3 is another @entity28 - a wannabe			2
a wannabe @entity0 opponent in hindsight who realises the daunting task ahead and decides i 'll live to fight another day rather than get annihilated			2
' i want to fight real fighters who want to fight			0
i started in a career in boxing to be involved in good fights , for people to say " yes ( he ) fought good fighters and did n't pick and choose "			0
' @entity20 is a much different proposition to @entity3 , standing seven inches taller , at 6ft 8in , and some four stones heavier			1
more importantly , he has lost only once in his 29 fights to date , and that came against @entity62 in september 2012 in an @entity64 eliminator bout			1
however , @entity0 ( 22 - 0 , @entity65 ) says he had no intention of disappointing the paying fans and is keen to fight on saturday , even if it comes at a great risk to his unbeaten record			1
dangerous : @entity20 has both the reach and power and has lost just one of his 29 fights ' i 'm not about to let people down especially in my home town , i do n't care if he ( @entity23 ) brought @entity78 to me on saturday night i was going to fight , ' said @entity0			1
' most people would have got a journeyman to fight , i do n't do that			0
this guy is rated number 10 in the world by two organisations , he 's not a pushover			0
' i 've had no sparring and no preparation			0
it 's a real 50/50 fight , it 's about who gets who out of there			0
injury : @entity3 ( left ) pulled out of the rematch after injuring his hand ' people like @entity3 and @entity28 are conning people , they 're out to con the public and the @entity100 say i 'm bad for boxing ! ' when i say i 'm going to fight , i fight			1
i would fight with no eyes			0
there was nothing going to keep me out of that ring on saturday			0
' for him ( @entity3 ) to have another little injury and pull out is absolutely pathetic			2
it 's a disgrace to the world of heavyweight boxing			0

@entity0 and @entity3 were due to meet in @entity13 on saturday
@entity3 pulled out of the fight on monday with *fractured* hand
@entity0 now to face @entity20 , who has lost just once in 29 fights
