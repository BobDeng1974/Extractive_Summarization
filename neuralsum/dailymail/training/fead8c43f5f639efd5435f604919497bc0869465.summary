the tv gardener said that unless more youngsters were encouraged into horticulture , the @entity15 could end up as ‘ little more than a wistful memory ’			1
young people grew up idolising celebrities , such as boyband @entity22 and @entity24 actor @entity23 , as well as hi - tech gadgets			1
‘ it ’s time we reconnected them with apples rather than @entity31 , plant cells rather than cell phones and raspberries as well as @entity35 , ’ he said			0
he warned that the young do not consider a future in horticulture because ‘ careers advisers never even think of it ’ and little is done to champion the industry			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ there is much to learn and , as anyone who has been involved with horticulture will tell you , it can be tremendously challenging			0
' and yet our role is undervalued by government , by the population and by young people in particular – in every instance because they just do not understand the breadth of what we do and its importance in terms of the wellbeing of the planet and its population			2
’ citing a recent survey that showed that 70 per cent of horticulture businesses could not fill skilled vacancies , and another 90 per cent saying the industry ‘ lacks career appeal ’ , mr @entity2 predicted a bleak future for @entity9 gardening unless attitudes are changed			0
he said : ‘ if this situation continues , @entity9 horticulture will dwindle and become a pale shadow of its former self , and @entity15 little more than a wistful memory			1
’ mr @entity2 was speaking at the launch last night of the @entity74 @entity73 , a fundraising drive to find £ 1million to support the next generation of horticulturists			0
next generation : @entity2 is concerned that not enough young people are interested in horticulture he said : ‘ the centenary of @entity15 gives us an opportunity that is not to be wasted – a chance to demonstrate that those of us involved in horticulture are not thick , or dull , or unadventurous or simply incapable of doing anything else			1
‘ without [ horticulture ] we would be hungry , uninspired , artistically stunted , unhealthily house - bound , pale of skin and unsound in body			0
‘ our wildlife would be deprived of habitats , birds would go hungry , bees would be short of nectar and frogs would fail to find sufficient places to spawn			0

young people obsess about ' celebs and gadgets ' not the *outdoors*
events like the @entity15 could become ' a wistful memory '
