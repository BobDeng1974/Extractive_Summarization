a bright idea : a yellow bicycle ... complete with its own rather @entity3 stuffed rider it started in the land of brie , croissants and berets – but this weekend , the @entity10 rolls into the land of @entity12 , parkin and flat caps			1
and it could n’t be receiving a warmer welcome			0
with ‘ @entity21 ’ set to provide a £ 100million boost to the economy , notoriously thrifty @entity20 folk are only too keen to cash in			1
some locals are renting out homes along the route for as much as £ 10,000 , while others have sold spots in their gardens for hundreds of pounds			1
room rates at conveniently - placed hotels have trebled , and farmers ’ fields and village cricket pitches have been transformed into money - spinning campsites or car parks			0
@entity36 of @entity37 , which successfully bid to host the race , praised the ‘ natural entrepreneurial spirit of the people of @entity20 ’ and said ‘ millions ’ would be watching this weekend ’s two stages - which are followed by a final @entity41 stage from @entity42 to @entity43			1
in preparation , some £ 6million has been spent by councils in ‘ @entity48 ’ on filling potholes and repairing roads on the route			1
it has n’t been an entirely smooth journey , though , as residents have complained that nearby roads in far worse condition have been left untouched – and @entity58 cyclist @entity57 , one of the favourites for the opening stage , has insisted the roads through the @entity62 are still ‘ very dangerous ’ because they are so narrow			2
nevertheless , from tomorrow the world ’s best cyclists will wind their way through cities , towns , villages and across the spectacular @entity70 countryside			0
the first stage is the 118 - mile stretch from @entity73 to @entity74 , then on sunday it ’s 124 miles through the @entity75 from @entity76 to @entity77			0

‘ i bit his hand off , ’ he said			0
mr @entity96 said another neighbour had ‘ sold ’ his garden space for £ 500			2
meanwhile , the owner of a cottage close to the stage two summit at @entity112 was asking £ 10,000 for the week , while a six - bedroom home in @entity74 was listed yesterday for £ 8,000			1
@entity114 , a tennis coach from @entity115 , set up a campsite with the help of a local farmer and is charging £ 45 for a weekend pitch			2

the @entity89 at @entity90 , near @entity77 , has been repainted white with red dots to match the @entity94 jersey			0
and in the village of @entity126 - in - @entity127 , scouts and guides have helped the @entity154 family build a 25ft version of the @entity125 as the race is going past their front door .			0
