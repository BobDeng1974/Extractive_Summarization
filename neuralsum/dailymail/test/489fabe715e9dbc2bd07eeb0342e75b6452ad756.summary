@entity1 boss @entity0 hopes injured @entity3 winger @entity2 could play a surprise role in the club 's play - off bid			1
the @entity7 capped midfielder was sent north by the @entity9 as part of a five - man package on the final day of the january transfer window			1
but @entity13 missed the fact he was carrying a long - term knee injury when they failed to carry out a medical			0
@entity0 confident @entity2 can play a vital role in @entity1 push for promotion to the @entity20 @entity2 , 23 , only checked in to the club 's @entity22 training base on monday after he was finally given the green light to resume action			1
now @entity0 has revealed the @entity27 - born wide man could make his @entity13 bow as the @entity29 side look to climb back to the @entity30 through the play - offs			1
the @entity33 boss said : ' i was really pleased yesterday when i saw him training			2
when you have been out for so long with a knee ligament injury , it 's not just the physical aspect but the mental one			0
' but he was really positive			0
i 've had a wee chat with him and he 's desperate to get involved			2
' he 's a wee bit away from match fitness and wo n't be ready to play in the next week or two because he 's been out too long			2
the on - loan @entity3 wide man has been out injured since he joined the club but is back training ' but he is mentally in the right place , as in he is here to help , and he could be a welcome addition for the back end of the season			2
' the deal which saw @entity2 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity59 swap @entity57 for @entity29 has proved controversial			1
so far , only @entity54 has played regularly			0
@entity60 picked up an injury on his debut against @entity63 and has not been seen since , while the other three arrived packing injury and fitness issues			0
but there was another sting in the tail for the frustrated @entity13 faithful when they learned the deal included a clause which meant their club would have to give @entity3 owner @entity74 a £ 500,000 cheque if they won promotion			2
@entity0 , though , joked he would be happy to hand over the cash if it meant he had succeeded in reclaiming @entity13 ' top - flight slot			1
he said : ' it was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out , because it 's quite a lot of money , especially when only one of them is playing			2
' but if it was me - and it 's not because it 's not my money - i 'd love to give @entity3 £ 500,000 because that means we have got promotion			0
' having made 23 appearances for his parent club , @entity2 will be a welcome addition to the squad @entity74 's standing in @entity96 took another pounding last week too when it emerged the club 's iconic trademarks and badges had been registered on a government website in the name of his sports direct firm			1
the billionaire tycoon loaned the previous regime running the club £ 5million in january and took security over a number of @entity1 assets - including the logos - in return			1
the new @entity1 board have now probed the affair and reassured fans they still remain the rightful owner of the badges - but the row had worried some fans @entity74 may now scupper any potential deal for @entity54 out of spite			1
the @entity121 has been the sole positive from @entity1 ' relationship with the @entity3 owner after scoring seven goals in just 12 games since moving north			1
but @entity0 is hopeful there will be no further repercussions , saying : ' from what i read from @entity133 , they are going to have a meeting with @entity135 in the near future			1
i 'm sure there will be some good talks come out of that			0
@entity54 ( left ) is only success story from the other loanee 's , scoring seven goals in 12 appearances ' @entity54 has another year left on his @entity3 contract			0
for the here and now he is trying to get us promotion			0
he is still a @entity3 player but i do n't think ( the badge row ) would have any bearing on ( any potential @entity1 bid )			1
' i do n't think there has been any great falling out with the club and @entity3 whatsoever			0
' @entity13 bounced back from last week 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity153 by sticking four goals past @entity63 on sunday			0
they now face basement boys @entity157 on wednesday but @entity0 expects another difficult match at the @entity159			1
he said : ' i genuinely think this could be one of the toughest games we 've got left			0
' i saw them win last week at home to @entity165 and you can tell they are a team that has got everything to play for			0
we have got to match their desire and hopefully our quality will take over			0
