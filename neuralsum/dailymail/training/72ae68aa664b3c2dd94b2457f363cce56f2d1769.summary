looking pale but alert , this is little @entity1 yesterday after his first day of long - awaited cancer therapy			1
the five - year - old brain tumour patient , whose parents fought to secure proton beam treatment for him , underwent the first of 30 sessions of the therapy at a clinic in @entity11			1
the session followed a week of tests after @entity1 was flown to the @entity15 capital from @entity16 by private jet			1
the @entity25 in @entity11 released a schedule for the first day of @entity1 's treatment for a brain tumour , which saw him leave the @entity40 this morning to undergo irradiation			1
his attending doctor , radiation oncologist dr @entity42 , said : ' there is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as @entity1 has - and there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery			1
' mr and mrs @entity1 faced a legal battle to get their child to @entity11 after removing @entity1 from hospital on august 28 , with a high court judge approving the move after they had been released from police custody in @entity16			1
@entity1 now faces 30 visits to the @entity25 , with the first 13 focusing on the brain and spine , to ensure the tumour he had removed has not spread , and the remaining 17 to irradiate where the brain tumour once was			1
optimistic : @entity1 is transported to the @entity25 to start his proton treatment yesterday morning			2
@entity15 doctors saying 70 - 80 per cent of patients in @entity1 's condition survive in a statement on its website , the @entity25 outlined the difference between proton beam therapy and conventional radiotherapy			1
it said : ' @entity76 can be much better modulated and precisely focused into the tumour volume			0
in case of irradiation of medulloblastoma in @entity82 , it is necessary to apply the highest possible dose into the former location but protect the tissue around as much as possible			0
' in @entity1 's case , those are vital structures of the heart , lung , liver and intestines			1
' @entity21 therapy would decrease the dose to other parts of the body , including the heart , liver and intestines and trachea by up to 80 per cent , the @entity21 said			0
' this means decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders , breathing disorders or metabolic disorders on the first place and better protection of the swallowing functions and normal food intake , ' the statement continued			0
upset : @entity110 and his wife @entity111 were allegedlly warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities care : mr @entity1 leans over his son to kiss him on the cheek as they arrived at the centre over the weekend according to the @entity21 's website , dr @entity42 specialises in cancer in children and is a member of the @entity127			2
last week , @entity1 's father claimed @entity130 authorities threatened to remove his son for 11 years after he challenged doctors over his treatment			1
@entity130 doctors opposed the plan to take @entity135 to the @entity11 clinic , saying it was not suitable for his condition , but the family disagreed and sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from hospital without permission and took him to @entity16			1
mr @entity1 said : ' they said to me if i question anything and ask questions as a father … they would take my son away from me , not just for the treatment but until he was 16 ... i would n't be able to see my son for 11 years			2
' ' i said to my wife this is something so serious that our son could be taken away until he is 16 ... 11 years without us , he would n't know his parents , his brothers , his sisters or anyone , ' he added			0
' we knew we could n't let that happen ... we could n't question them any more			0
we could n't let them know our feelings because one mistake on our side and they 'd take him away , ' he went on to say			0
@entity27 , 51 , and @entity23 , 45 , were reunited with their son after 72 hours in jail and later dramatically granted permission by a high court judge to allow @entity1 to undergo proton therapy in @entity174 @entity1 's parents removed him from @entity31 without the permission of doctors late last month and took him to @entity16 where they planned to sell a holiday home to fund the alternative treatment			1
@entity31 have repeatedly said they absolutely refute the suggestion that the @entity1 family was threatened			2
after being tracked down they were arrested and thrown into a @entity183 jail for three nights			0
they were released following a public outcry and reunited with @entity1 who had been removed and put into a hospital in @entity188			2
@entity1 previously had major surgery to remove a brain tumour on 24 july and a further operation on his brain on 22 august			1
the £ 30million @entity25 where @entity1 is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer - fighting technology			2
built in 2012 , the gleaming white lobby of the five - storey building on the outskirts of @entity11 appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas			0
the centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target			0
for brain tumours , this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours , staff claim			0
a course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits			0
sessions never last more than 30 minutes			0
treatment : @entity218 , chief medical officer of proton therapy ( right ) shows @entity110 ( wearing blue shirt and striped tie ) around the centre where his son will receive treatment for medulloblastoma			0
