@entity0 accused teaching unions of adopting a ‘ twisted , militant logic ’ to justify strikes that closed nearly 3,000 schools yesterday			1
the @entity5 said it was bizarre that the @entity7 and @entity8 were striking over plans for performance - related pay that will see the best teachers paid more			1
speaking at the @entity13 conference , mr @entity0 angrily hit out at the unions as the ‘ enemies of promise ’ , saying they had selfishly ‘ put their ideology before pupils ’ interests ’			2
schools out : a rally in @entity24 yesterday over proposed changes to teachers ' pension schemes and pay he added : ‘ while we gather here today , the leaders of the militant teaching unions have gone out on strike			1
' and the reason that they have gone out on strike , in a new example of a twisted militant logic , is that they want to stop good teachers being paid more money			1
‘ they are striking against ... the growth and potential of poor children			1
’ his comments came as 2,703 schools were closed as a result of industrial action			1
tens of thousands of children missed classes after 49 local authorities in the east of @entity55 , the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 and @entity59 , were affected			2
secretary of state for education , @entity0 , criticised teachers for striking mr @entity0 savaged claims by union leaders that they were implementing ‘ child - friendly industrial action ’ , saying : ‘ there is nothing child - friendly about industrial action			1
‘ children lose a day of education , parents have to scrabble to pay more for expensive child care and the prestige of the teaching profession , which we all want to see reinforced and built up , takes a knock			1
‘ i have a simple message for the leaders of the teaching unions : please , please , please do n’t put your ideology before our children ’s interests			1
’ the @entity85 said only 29 per cent of schools in the affected regions were closed			1
figures for partially closed schools were not available			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity7 and @entity8 have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible			0
‘ in spite of this , thanks to many hard - working teachers and heads , only a third of schools in the targeted regions were closed today			1
’ thousands of chanting members of the @entity7 and @entity8 took to the streets of @entity24 , @entity103 and @entity104 to voice their anger over changes to pay , pensions and work @entity108 them were children carrying banners with slogans , including ‘ save my future ’ , ‘ protect my teachers ’ and ‘ @entity0 out ’			1
but angry parents said they had been forced to alter plans or pay for child care			1
@entity117 , a councillor in charge of education at @entity13 - led @entity120 , said she had to take her 13 - year - old son @entity121 to meetings			2
strike action : more than 2,700 schools closed yesterday as teachers held strikes over plans to introduce performance - related pay ‘ unfortunately we do n’t have any grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for their own children , ’ she said			1
‘ i have a diary of commitments to people and i really do n’t feel i can let people down because of this strike			0
’ the strike was the third of four one - day regional walk - outs , which will be followed by nationwide industrial action before @entity144			1
the next will affect @entity146 , the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 on october 17			0
@entity150 , general secretary of the @entity7 , said she was sorry for the disruption but added : ‘ the government ’s refusal to engage in meaningful talks has led to the @entity7 and @entity8 taking strike action			2
’ low turn - out meant that less than a quarter of the unions ’ members originally voted for industrial action			1
march : members of @entity7 and @entity8 , pictured in @entity103 yesterday , were accused by @entity0 of putting their ideology before the interests of pupils it came as a former @entity167 teachers ’ union leader from @entity169 urged his @entity171 counterparts to think again about opposing reforms			1
@entity173 said unions spent too much time trying to defend bad teachers and opposing reforms that would help children			1
mr @entity173 , who received a standing ovation at the @entity13 conference yesterday , said : ‘ performance pay can work			2
it ’s working in @entity169 ’ praising the free schools and academies programmes , he said : ‘ the concept of removing the bureaucracy that schools have to go through is an excellent idea			2
i am going to go back to @entity167 and get into trouble with my union buddies by talking about these things			0
’ @entity192 : @entity7 general secretary @entity150 said @entity0 left teachers with no choice but to strike by @entity196 @entity150 does n’t like grammar schools , free schools , academy status , streaming , @entity201 or league tables			2
it goes without saying that public schools give her apoplexy			2
but what really makes her red flag fly high is education secretary @entity0			0
yesterday morning , as mr @entity0 prepared to deliver his speech – she does n’t like the @entity13 either – the general secretary of the @entity7 made a defiant statement of rebellion which led to thousands of schools in @entity55 staying shut for the day			2
for the strike was orchestrated by the self - styled ‘ miner ’s daughter ’ from that hard - graft , clogs and whippets pit town of @entity222 , @entity223			2
‘ no teacher takes strike action lightly , but the intransigence of this @entity5 has left teachers with no choice , ’ ms @entity150 huffed			1
and yet industrial action has been a hallmark of her leadership of the nut			1
one of her predecessors even said she was someone ‘ for whom strike action is the only solution to problems ’			0
as if to prove this , ms @entity150 ’s first task on assuming the top job in 2008 was to lead the membership on their own first national walk - out for two decades			0
yesterday ’s was simply part of the latest series of school stoppages which will continue until @entity144 holidays , as she battles mr @entity0 ’s plans to introduce performance - related pay , and increase pension contributions and workload			1
if her own salary was the result of a performance - related calculation then she would surely be doing a brilliant job			1
at a reported £ 154,000 a year including pension top - ups , the @entity258 pay packet compares very favourably with the prime minister ’s £ 142,000 per annum			2
poor mr @entity0 ’s salary is a good £ 20,000 less than ms @entity150 ’s , but then she would no doubt argue that he is doing a useless job			0
her considerable renumeration package sits a little uneasily with her own far - left political views which had made her a controversial figure within teaching , even before becoming @entity7 leader			0
while she would later decry the two - tier system , ms @entity150 was educated in the grammar rather than secondary modern stream of a local state school			0
comparison : with a reported £ 154,000 a year pay packet , @entity150 's annual salary is more than prime minister @entity275 £ 142,000 per annum having considered a career in the probation service , she decided on teaching			0
her first post was teaching @entity280 at @entity282 comprehensive school , dubbed the ‘ socialist @entity283 ’			0
it had just done away with streaming , which was just fine by the new mistress , who recalled : ‘ any class has a range of abilities but , in streaming or setting , there ’s a risk you do n’t realise that and treat them all as though they ’re exactly the same			0
in mixed ability , you know you need the teaching style and the materials to hit the whole range			0
’ her subsequent career took her to other west @entity146 schools and she ultimately became a full - time official of the nut			2
her membership dates back to her entry into the profession			0
by the 1980s she was a local official before being elected to the @entity310 in 1992			0
but what were her own politics ? her @entity314 membership lapsed some two decades ago , and by 1999 she was telling the @entity316 newspaper she was ‘ to the left of @entity318 ’ that was the year she first stood for general secretary , against the incumbent @entity321 , who warned members that she had ‘ a political and revolutionary platform ’ that she ‘ seeks to impose on members ’			0
he even took out an advertisement claiming his opponent was ‘ controlled by a group of extreme @entity330 organisations including @entity331 ’			0
in 2005 she was elected as @entity7 deputy general secretary and , three years later , stepped up when the then leader @entity333 , died			0
since then she has been ‘ militating ’ as she puts it , rather than @entity331			0
her private actions in terms of how her own children are educated have not always been consistent			0
she stopped one of her two daughters from sitting sats at the ages of seven and 11 in protest , but allowed the other to take them because the girl did not want to be ‘ singled out ’			0
it was also reported in a newspaper blog that one of her daughters was sent to a high - performing state school outside her home borough			0
ms @entity150 appears to have neither confirmed or denied the report			0
‘ you have to make different decisions about different children , regardless of your politics , ’ she has argued , referring to her decision about the @entity340			0
that might sound a little hollow to the parents of the children at the schools she closed yesterday .			1
