if you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning , do n’t blame them - it could be your fault			0
our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes , according to a large study			1
the researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children ’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents			1
our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes , according to a study by @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19			1
more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research ( stock image shown ) psychologists from @entity25 , and @entity19 in the @entity26 studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries , including the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and the @entity26			1
the researchers said they were surprised by the results , believing that the twins ’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics			2
instead , genetics and non-shared - environment factors had the largest effect on the children ’s motivation to learn , whereas the shared environment had negligible impact			1
genetics and non-shared - environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children ’s motivation to learn , whereas the shared environment had negligible impact ( stock image shown ) a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long - held stereotype			1
the study , which looked at data from 1914 to 2011 , suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years			2
the research also claims that girls do better at all ages , in all subjects and all over the world			0
according to the data , compiled by the @entity68 in @entity30 , girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers , from infant school to secondary school			0
accordingly , we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom , the researchers said			0
‘ we had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures , ’ said professor @entity82 , of @entity19			2
the knee - jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student , or the child himself is responsible			0
‘ we found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation			0
‘ that does n’t mean we do n’t try to encourage and inspire students , but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different			0
’ the results do n’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning , he added , but they suggest a complex process , involving many genes and gene - environment interactions that help influence a child ’s motivation to learn			1
the study will be published in the journal @entity115 .			0

willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes
study was by @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19
more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research
but there is no specific gene for how much children enjoy learning
