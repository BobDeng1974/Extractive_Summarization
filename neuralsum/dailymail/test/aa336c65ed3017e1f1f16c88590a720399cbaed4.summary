this is the terrifying moment a gigantic tornado swept past a hapless motorist in @entity3 , who filmed it from his truck the driver , @entity8 , begins filming with the tornado just a few hundred yards in front of him harrowing : it then passes right in front of his truck - while mr @entity8 spoke to his son on the phone he says on the video : ' this is a tornado and i can not tell which way it is going			1
so i do n't know how to get away from it			1
but it looks like it 's coming right towards me			1
' sounding remarkably calm , he continues : ' yep , it 's going to come right over me			1
let 's see if i can back up a little bit and get under the bridge			1
yeah , it 's coming right over me			1
' oh c * * p. i 've never been in a tornado before			1
it 's coming right over the top of me			1
it 's a little bit scary			2
' i do n't really know what to do except i guess just sit here			2
the truck feels like it 's about to lift up off the ground			2
' the tornado blows debris across the road in front of mr @entity8 's truck as the tornado sweeps past mr @entity8 says that the truck felt like it was going to lift off the ground mr @entity8 was travelling from @entity60 to @entity61 on business last thursday when the harrowing encounter took place mr @entity8 said afterwards that he hung up on his son so he would think they were disconnected as ' it seemed things were going to get real bad ' fortunately the tornado passes leaving mr @entity8 unharmed and his truck intact , but the footage clearly shows that it was a close call			1
mr @entity8 was travelling from @entity60 to @entity61 on business last thursday when the harrowing encounter took place			1
he said afterwards : ' there was heavy rain and i saw cars pulling off the side of the road			2
i thought it was because they did not want to drive in heavy rain			2
then it started hailing very large golf ball - sized hail			2
i thought the truck would be dented so i pulled off the road under and over-pass with several other vehicles			2
' as i was leaving that over-pass my son called and i answered			1
it was then that i saw the tornado far off in the distance			2
he was excited and asked me to record it			0
so as i approached the next over-pass i pulled under it			0
' having no idea it was coming right my way			0
i continued to film and backed my truck further under the over-pass			0
as it got closer and closer i realized it was most likely going to hit me			0
i remained calm since i had my son on the phone			1
as it got closer it seemed likely things were going to get real bad and so i hung up on my son without saying goodbye so he would think we just got disconnected			1
the video tells a pretty good story from there			0
' according to the @entity111 in @entity112 , mr @entity8 should not have backed his car under a bridge when he caught sight of the tornado			0
it says on its online tornado safety guide that if you 're in a vehicle when one comes near that you must ' avoid seeking shelter under bridges ' as it can create ' deadly traffic hazards while offering little protection against flying debris '			0
it continues : ' there is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car , just slightly less - dangerous ones			0
if the tornado is visible , far away , and the traffic is light , you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado			0
' seek shelter in a sturdy building , or underground if possible			0
if you are caught by extreme winds or flying debris , park the car as quickly and safely as possible - out of the traffic lanes			0
stay in the car with the seat belt on			0
put your head down below the windows , cover your head with your hands and a blanket , coat , or other cushion if possible			0
if you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway , leave your car and lie in that area , covering your head with your hands			0
if you 're in a mobile home it strongly advises to leave immediately and to head to the basement if you live in a house that has one			0
if you 're in a building with lots of glass occupants should go to a windowless room on the lowest floor possible , the guide says .			0
