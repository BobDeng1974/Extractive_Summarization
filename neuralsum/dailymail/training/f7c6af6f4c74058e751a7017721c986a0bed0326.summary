is obesity a disability or a self - inflicted condition triggered by a lack of willpower and overeating ? and should people who are overweight be protected by the same discrimination laws that were put in place to shield those who are wheel - chair bound , people with learning difficulties , hearing and visual impairments or those with autism spectrum disorders ? a landmark test case being brought before judges at the @entity18 today has sparked a vigorous debate on the issue			1
the result of it may mean @entity24 companies will have to treat obese workers as ' disabled ' , making allowances for their size by providing larger seats and parking spaces closer to the office			2
a landmark test case is being brought before judges at the @entity18 today by @entity33 , pictured , which could result in obesity being classed as a disability for employers in the @entity24 mr @entity33 was sacked by his local authority in @entity39 for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder because of his 25 stone size @entity33 is taking action after he was sacked by his local authority in @entity39 for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder , due to his size			1
the council , @entity47 , claimed the 25 stone childminder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children 's shoelaces			1
if successful in redefining obesity as a disability , mr @entity33 's lawyers could force widespread changes in the way bosses deal with staff			1
currently in the @entity24 the law is clear , the @entity60 refrained from classing obesity as a disability			1
instead the @entity64 definition is that a person is ' disabled under the @entity60 , if they have a physical or mental impairment that has a ' substantial ' and ' long - term ' negative effect on a person 's ability to do normal daily activities			2
' however for many people living with a disability , they self - define themselves as such , basing their disability more on the barriers society puts in the way of them leading the life they wish			2
for someone bound to a wheelchair steps to a cinema or restaurant , can provide a barrier and as a result a person is likely to class themselves as disabled			0
debating the issue on today 's @entity89 , writer and broadcaster @entity91 and journalist @entity92 , explored both sides of the issue			1
ms @entity92 said : ' i am not sure it ( obesity ) should be treated as a disabilty			2
' but what he is trying to say is if you are going to have anti-discrimination laws , they need to be universal			0
' should it distinguish between what employees you are going to protect and those you are not going to protect ? journalist @entity92 ( left ) and broadcaster and writer @entity91 ( right ) debated this issue on today 's @entity89 ' it is not about saying if i am fat i am disabled , rather it is about if i ca n't do my job because i am fat , i deserve the same protection as someone who ca n't do their job because they are disabled , or pregnant			1
' but journalist and writer ms @entity91 argued obesity is not a disability , rather a self - inflicted condition brought on by people who can not resist the urge to eat			1
when asked whether people should be protected by anti-discrimination laws because they are obese , she said : ' not in the case of people who self - inflict their disability			1
' in the case of this @entity39 guy , he was 25st			1
all he needed to do was eat less doughnuts and less @entity39 pastries and he would have been able to bend down and tie the children 's shoe laces			1
ms @entity91 argued in ' 95 per cent of cases ' obesity is self - inflicted ' by people lacking discipline and self - control ' ' but because he did n't , he could n't			1
and clearly is literally not fit enough to look after those kids			0
' if you ca n't bend down to tie your shoe lace you ca n't help them if they fall down , you ca n't react quickly enough if something happens			0
' that man was clearly not suited to that job			0
' challenging ms @entity91 's suggestion that ' obesity is self - inflicted in 95 per cent of cases ' , ms @entity92 branded the statement ' unfair '			2
she said : ' at the end of the day if you are completely drunk and take a dive into a shallow swimming pool and end up disabled , that is self - inflicted			2
' i am not saying that person should not be protected but equally you do n't know why people become fat , the vast majority of people become fat because they have psychological issues or health problems			0
' ms @entity91 responded : ' that is simply not true			0
we are both , i would say , a bit overweight ( to which ms @entity92 agreed )			0
there is no disability , no psychological problem , i am overweight			0
' the majority of people who are overweight have psychological problems , no they do n't			0
the majority of people who are overweight have no discipline and no self - control			0
' she added : ' the @entity60 ruled that obesity is not a disability			2
' what is going to happen if this court ruling happens , it is going to punish people who are overweight because employers will not employ fat people , or people they think might get fat			0
' why should you get special treatment if you have abused your body knowingly - that is what a lot of obese people do			0
' people generally get fat , in 95 per cent of cases , because they eat too much			0
' disability charity scope asked users and supporters for their views on the debate , via @entity208 and @entity209 , yesterday			1
the overwhelming response from members of the public was that obesity should not be classed as a disability .			1
