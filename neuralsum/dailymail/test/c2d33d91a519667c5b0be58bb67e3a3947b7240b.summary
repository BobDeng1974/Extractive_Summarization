@entity0 showed they are in good shape to cope with @entity3 's retirement as they claimed a 26 - 12 derby victory over @entity5 in front of a sell - out crowd at the @entity8			1
the @entity10 leaders were without their inspirational captain , who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015 , for the third successive game on @entity16 , but they continue to thrive without him			1
the @entity0 had beaten @entity17 and @entity18 in @entity3 's absence and added @entity5 to that list thanks to an excellent team performance , with young winger @entity22 particularly impressive up against the formidable @entity23			1
@entity0 @entity25 's @entity24 celebrates a try with @entity27 ( left ) @entity28 was sent to the sin - bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but @entity5 failed to take advantage and it was the @entity0 who struck first as @entity36 scored his first try of the season			1
@entity28 made amends by extending @entity0 ' lead and @entity42 's converted try cancelled out @entity44 's effort to give the @entity0 a 16 - 6 half - time lead			2
there were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute , when @entity28 completed his double			0
@entity24 then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite @entity44 's late second , @entity0 extended their unbeaten run against the @entity5 to six matches			2
@entity0 @entity25 's @entity36 scores the first try for his side during their victory @entity63 warned the @entity0 to be wary of a fast start by @entity5 and although it was @entity0 who came out of the blocks quickest , the @entity5 were handed an early advantage when @entity28 was sent to the sin - bin for a professional foul			1
@entity0 youth product @entity70 failed to exploit the gap in the @entity0 ' left side when his pass to @entity75 from the resultant penalty floated forwards			0
@entity78 was next to fluff his lines as he spilled the ball reaching for the tryline , but @entity0 did not have to wait much longer for their first try of the afternoon			0
the @entity0 rolled downfield after a knock - on by @entity83 , and @entity84 exchanged passes with @entity86 before putting @entity36 through a hole to score			2
@entity28 had returned to the field just in time to congratulate his team - mate and he was celebrating a try of his own soon after			0
@entity0 @entity25 's @entity28 goes over the line for their third try of the clash @entity94 was hauled down just short of the line after @entity36 's break but @entity24 kept his cool on the next play to give @entity28 an easy finish in the corner			0
@entity78 landed the touchline conversion to give @entity0 a 10 - 0 lead			2
the @entity0 went in search of a crucial third try - with @entity103 just held up over the line - but their lead was cut to four points when @entity44 reacted quickest to @entity108 's dab through and @entity70 kicked a goal from out wide			2
the momentum was suddenly with @entity5 as they probed for another try to level up the contest , but such was its nature that @entity0 re-established their 10 - point lead			1
@entity0 captain @entity3 sat out during the week he announced he was switching codes @entity116 played a big part in taking the @entity0 close to the @entity5 ' line and @entity78 's neat reverse kick sat up nicely for @entity42 to get downward pressure on the ball			1
good defence by @entity78 denied @entity44 his second try at the start of the second half before @entity24 was held up over the line at the other end			0
the excitement continued as @entity23 picked up a loose @entity0 pass well inside his own half and raced clear seemingly destined to score , only for @entity94 to slow him down with an ankle tap before @entity22 hauled him down			0
@entity0 @entity25 's @entity131 makes a run during the @entity10 match at the @entity8 - @entity134 @entity23 then turned try - saver when he stopped @entity131 finishing off a @entity0 break and @entity0 were denied by more impressive @entity5 defence as @entity86 was held up			1
the visitors finally broke through for a fourth time when @entity94 spotted his side had numbers on the left and found @entity36 , who gave @entity28 another simple task in the corner			0
@entity145 forward @entity24 continued his fine first season in @entity147 with a powerful finish , but the @entity5 had the last word as @entity44 exchanged passes with @entity23 to score .			0
