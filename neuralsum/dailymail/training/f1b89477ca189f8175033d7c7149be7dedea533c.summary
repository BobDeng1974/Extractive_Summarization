by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 21 november 2012 one wrong turning became a 24 - hour rescue mission after a hapless @entity4 lorry driver followed his sat - nav into a dead end			1
he had ignored signs warning that the road was not suitable for @entity9 and got the 40ft wagon stuck on a tight bend			1
a team of around ten workers from a specialist recovery team then spent more than 15 hours digging out earth from the side of the road to ease it free			1
stuck in the mud : the lorry driver was left red - faced after he followed his sat nav down a dirt track and got trapped on a tight bend team effort : ten workers and a local farmer spent 15 hours digging out the lorry in @entity26 , @entity27 a local farmer eventually helped out by offering the use of his digger while villagers gathered at the scene and brought coffee and sandwiches for the workers			1
police said a wall had been left damaged following the incident in @entity26 , @entity27			1
officers attended at about 9am last tuesday and closed off @entity40 before calling out vehicle recovery firm @entity42			2
the truck - registered in @entity44 , @entity4 - had been on its way to deliver industrial yarn to textiles firm @entity48 , based in @entity49			2
it was eventually released in the early hours of wednesday morning and successfully made its delivery later that day without any damage to the goods inside			2
no entry : the driver ignored warning signs that the road was n't suitable for @entity9 all hands to the pump : local villagers brought coffee and sandwiches for the workers as they battled for hours to free the lorry @entity64 , 58 , watched the drama unfold with his wife and two children			1
he said : ' i just could n’t believe he had got round the first bend			0
he must have gone right up the bank and nearly tipped over			0
' you could n’t even squeeze around the side of it , that ’s how narrow the lane is			0
they were still digging it out when i went to bed that night at 11:30pm			0
' mr @entity64 said although incidents of this type were rare in the village , it showed the perils of relying on sat - navs			1
' i did feel sorry for the chap because he must have been in his sixties and he spoke virtually no @entity86			0
' but if you ’re a @entity88 driver and you see you ’re going down a narrow country lane you should know not to go any further			2
you have got to be sensible using them			0
' the @entity42 and @entity92 both declined to comment			0
there are signs on entering the village which warn lorry drivers the roads are n’t suitable for @entity9			1
but local councillor @entity98 said it was still a problem and more needs to be done to tackle it			2
she said : ' it ’s an ongoing problem and i ’m very worried about it			0
these lorries are blindly following sat - navs and are ignoring signs and weight restrictions			1
' it ’s not fair on residents who end up with their roads blocked			0
' recurring theme : local councillor @entity98 said the number of lorrys getting stuck on the road is an ' ongoing problem ' ' and i am concerned about pedestrians and cyclists potentially being hits , as well as the damage being done to walls			1
' the police do what they can , but i think tough action such as impounding some of the lorries , if there is the power to do it , would really send a message out			0
' and firms should have to pay for any damage caused			0
