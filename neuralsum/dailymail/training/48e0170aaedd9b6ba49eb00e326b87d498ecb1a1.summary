by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:46 est , 23 february 2014 @entity3 : 20:46 est , 23 february 2014 justice secretary : @entity5 said new laws would stop serial offenders who think they can put up ' two fingers to the system ' criminals who repeatedly flout the law after getting out of jail will be forced to serve their full sentence behind bars , @entity5 said today			1
a loophole in the rules means the vast majority of offenders who break the terms of their early release get just 28 days back inside before they are let out again			1
the loophole applies even if they breach their licence conditions again and again			2
but in a new toughening of release rules from the justice secretary , repeat offenders will face remaining in jail until the end of their original sentence			1
last night mr @entity5 told the @entity30 it would stop serial offenders who think they can put up ‘ two fingers to the system ’			1
he said : ‘ like the rest of the public , i ’m fed up with offenders who think they can just put two fingers to the system and act like it does n’t apply to them			1
‘ that ’s why we are closing the loophole for those who just think they can just time and again flout their licence conditions and get away with it			2
‘ offenders need to understand that there are tough consequences for poor behaviour - that ’s part of how we can tackle reoffending to make sure communities are safer , and that there fewer victims of crime			1
’ the change will mean a group of serial offenders serving , on average , an additional eight months behind bars before they are released			2
the new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison , usually at the half way point			0
these conditions can include wearing a tag , not returning to places where they commit crimes , or staying away from victims			0
at the moment , the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence regardless of how many times they have broken the rules			1
they can only be kept inside for longer if they present a ‘ high risk ’ of causing serious harm to the public			0
reduced : at the moment , the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence but when the new law comes in to force , offenders who are ‘ non-compliant ’ will stay in jail until the @entity88 says they can be trusted not to break the rules			1
if the @entity88 decides they will still break the rules , they will stay inside until the end of their jail term			2
the new rules are among a series of changes to be debated by @entity95 today as the @entity96 returns to @entity97			0
the flagship @entity98 also includes longer sentences for perverts caught with sickening pornographic videos depicting rape and a new ‘ tax ’ on criminals to make them pay for the costs of the courts			0
another central pledge is to end the scandal of police officers doling out repeat cautions to thousands of criminals			0
progress : the new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison , usually at the half way point every year nearly 10,000 criminals get a caution for the same offence they committed within the previous two years			0
but a ban on repeat cautions will mean serial offenders hauled before the courts for every new offence			0
it is expected that around 14,000 fewer cautions will be issued each year .			0

loophole means some offenders who break terms get 28 days back inside
@entity5 said it would stop those who ' put two fingers up the system '
justice secretary said more *people* needed to understand the consequences for poor behaviour
