legal action : the government is making a final attempt to stop letters from @entity4 to ministers being released publishing dozens of letters in which prince @entity4 lobbied ministers would infringe his ‘ freedom of expression ’ , the government claimed today			1
the heir to the throne ’s correspondence with senior politicians on major issues of the day forms an important part of his training to become @entity19 and must remain confidential , lawyers argued			0
former attorney general @entity20 ruled that 27 memos sent by the prince to ministers in seven @entity24 departments putting forward his views about policy could not be released			1
@entity27 and his cabinet backed the decision even though they had not seen all of the letters , which date from when @entity33 was prime minister			0
but the @entity34 overturned the ban , finding that mr @entity20 did not have ‘ reasonable grounds ’ for blocking the disclosure of the correspondence			0
the government today appealed to the @entity41 ’s most senior judges at the @entity42 in @entity43 in a final attempt to stop the @entity4 ’s campaigning letters being made available for the public to read			1
@entity47 , for the attorney general , argued that releasing @entity4 ’ memos to ministers would be a ‘ breach of confidence ’			1
‘ everyone has the right to respect for their correspondence , ’ he said in a written submission to the court			0
‘ such respect is necessary not only as an aspect of privacy , but also to enable freedom of expression , which would inevitably be inhibited by the removal of the right to communicate privately			0
‘ all the more so in the case of the @entity4 , whose freedom to express himself publicly is constrained by his role as heir to the throne			2
’ @entity4 has been accused of meddling in politics through his handwritten ‘ black spider memos ’ to politicians on topics about which he cares passionately , including @entity75 foods , complementary medicine , farming and architecture			1
by contrast , when he succeeds his mother and becomes @entity19 , he will be bound by the long - standing constitutional convention that @entity41 monarchs can only encourage , warn and be consulted by the government of the day			2
the unique court case heard todayis the culmination of a nine - year legal battle that began in 2005 when a journalist for the @entity89 newspaper applied to get copies of the @entity4 ’s letters to ministers under the @entity93			1
highest court : judges at the @entity42 will hear two days of evidence before deciding where correspondence from @entity4 should be made public letter lover : prince @entity4 is said to have sent 1,000 letters a year at peak periods in his life a defiant prince @entity4 has always maintained he has the right to express his forthright views to ministers even after he becomes @entity19			1
at peak periods , his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers and other public figures			2
as the furore over his ' black spider ' letters peaked in 2012 , the heir to throne was said to be unrepentant about the row furore sparked by the government ’s decision to stop 27 ‘ particularly frank ’ letters written to ministers in the last @entity120 government to be revealed			1
courtiers told the @entity122 that it is the prince ’s ‘ right and absolute duty ’ to correspond with politicians over issues that affect his country and future subjects			0
and sources close to the prince made clear that @entity4 will continue to air his opinions , even during his private meetings with the prime minister after he accedes to the throne			0
' the @entity4 absolutely sees it as his duty to make his views known to ministers , ’ they said			2
‘ he is a man of passionate belief and will always strive to make his views clear			0
’ as a self - confessed ‘ interfering busybody ’ , @entity4 has become renowned for expressing his strong views on a huge variety of issues ranging from youth opportunity to architecture and the environment			2
his prolific missives are known as ‘ black spider memos ’ because of his scrawled handwriting			1
explaining his willingness to get involved in issues and causes he said himself : ' the trouble is , i always feel that unless i rush about doing things and trying to help furiously , i will not ( and the monarchy will not ) be seen to be relevant and i will be considered a mere playboy			0
’ mr @entity20 argued that @entity4 ’ correspondence helped to prepare him for the exercise of his powers as @entity19 , the court heard			0
‘ through the exchange of views with ministers , the @entity4 would better understand the business of government and strengthen his relations with ministers , ’ mr @entity163 said			2
‘ through interaction and correspondence of any nature , the @entity4 may be developing relationships with ministers who at any moment may form his government when he becomes sovereign			2
’ mr @entity163 said @entity179 gave weight to the ‘ public interest in preserving our constitutional monarchy ’ when it passed the @entity184 by allowing for communications with royals to be withheld unless there was a clear public interest in releasing them			0
views : an august 2000 letter from @entity192 , @entity33 's mentor and later the lord chancellor , heavily annotated by @entity4 in his ' black spider ' handwriting but lawyers for the @entity89 argued that powers allowing a cabinet minister or the attorney general to overturn any tribunal ruling that information should be disclosed under the @entity93 were ‘ unique ’ in @entity41 law			1
this power has been used only seven times in the past 10 years since the @entity93 came into force in full in 2005			0
@entity206 , for the @entity89 , argued in written submissions that the attorney general was ‘ neither independent nor impartial ’ because he was a member of the government seeking to stop the @entity4 ’s letters being released			1
the case is believed to be the first time that anyone has challenged the attorney general ’s powers to block access to information			1
the judges will make their ruling at a later date .			0
