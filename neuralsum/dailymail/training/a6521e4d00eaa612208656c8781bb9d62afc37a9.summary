the company behind plans for a new high - speed rail link has been accused of using ‘ strong arm tactics ’ to stop people from raising their objections to the £ 50 billion @entity6 project			1
residents who fear their communities will be blighted by the planned 225mph rail line say they were visited at home by groups of @entity6 officials and urged not to give evidence to a powerful parliamentary committee which can order major changes to the scheme			1
the visits came after they submitted petitions to the @entity20 , which led them to be targeted by @entity6 – the government - funded company behind the scheme			1
she said @entity43 , an @entity6 engineer , told her : ‘ we want to buy you off to prevent you from appearing before the @entity20 and will continue trying to do so right up to the doors of @entity46 [ where the hearings are being held ]			2
’ mrs @entity26 said that rather than money , @entity6 had offered a pedestrian crossing near the primary school in the village of @entity52 , @entity53 , close to where the first phase of the @entity6 line will end			1
she said : ‘ they stated their intention clearly – they just wanted to shut me up			1
’ the cross-party high speed rail @entity58 has received almost 2,000 petitions against @entity6 and has started hearing each case in turn			1
it has the power to order costly alterations to the proposed route , further tunnelling and noise prevention barriers			0
thirty - seven objectors have so far appeared before the committee			0
however , a further 32 people due to give evidence have suddenly withdrawn their opposition or failed to show up on their allotted day			0
@entity72 , 79 , who runs a nature reserve for a society for the disabled in @entity76 , said he was also visited by mr @entity43 , petitions manager @entity77 and two other @entity6 officials			1
this image issued by @entity6 shows the @entity81 and @entity82 viaduct , part of the proposed route for the high speed rail scheme he said : ‘ having talked all around my petition , @entity92 suddenly said , “ are you sure you still want to go ahead ? ” i told them nothing would stop me as i was going to say my piece no matter what			2
‘ i got the distinct impression they would have been cock - a - hoop if i suddenly said i would n’t be going to @entity100			0
it feels like they are trying to reduce the number of petitions the committee has to consider			0
’ @entity6 last night denied any wrongdoing in its dealings with objectors			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we do not seek in any way to curtail people ’s right to appear before the @entity113			0
@entity6 is seeking to resolve people ’s concerns before they go to @entity116			2
’ sir @entity117 , a @entity118 mp on the @entity119 , said he was not aware of any intimidation tactics and said the negotiations appeared ‘ perfectly normal ’			0
he added : ‘ if they can reach a satisfactory agreement which is fair to the public purse and to the petitioner , that ’s fine			0
