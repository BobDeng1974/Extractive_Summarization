the outdoor court , in @entity16 in western @entity6 's @entity18 province , was fitted with loudspeakers so the audience could hear the evidence against him			1
thousands of onlookers turned up to watch the public trial of serial rapist @entity11 in @entity6 's @entity18 province open justice : these pictures show the thousands who gathered to see @entity11 , 30 , convicted police officers carry the serial rapist @entity11 to the public trial in @entity16 in western @entity6 @entity6 's @entity12 is using mass public trials to show determination to crack down on crime the case was a high profile one in the region in which a series of rapes were carried out against young women by somebody who seemed to plan each attack professionally			1
local media reported that police suspected it was a former soldier , but in the end dna testing and images from @entity46 cameras finally allowed police to identify @entity11 as the man behind the attacks			2
a highly decorated former police officer , @entity11 had only recently left the force and taken up work as a security guard in a school			0
his former colleagues who recognised him at first refused to act saying that they could not believe he was really to blame but images of one of the attacks and the dna evidence proved a clear - cut case , the court heard			0
prosecutor @entity62 said that the former officer was a classic @entity64 character - by day seeming to be an upholder of the law and at night a sexual predator of the worst sort			0

such events continued to be held in the 1980s and 1990s as the government battled rising crime fuelled by the country â€™s dramatic economic reforms but then they gradually fell into disfavour and were mostly phased out			0
they came back in recently as the country wanted to once again show it was getting tough on terrorist violence mainly linked to militants within the mostly @entity105 community in the remote north - western region of @entity107			0
and the feedback has been so positive that it seems the mass public trials of now once again the order of the day , with the practice spreading from terrorists through to more regular criminals including the recent trial against the alleged rapist @entity11 .			2
