by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:53 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 20 july 2013 @entity3 chiefs are at the centre of a row over a £ 623,555 secret payout to a senior civil servant who they have refused to name			1
the massive redundancy package was among nearly 1,300 handed out to lawyers and civil servants working for the @entity3 over the past three years			1
but none have been publicly named			0
last night a former senior @entity3 lawyer said the agency had a duty to name the highest paid individual because the compensation was public money			2
cuts : there have been nearly 1,300 redundancy packages which averaged at £ 48 , 434 handed out by the @entity3 in the last three years he said : ‘ if the @entity24 are able to name top executives who receive golden payouts , i can see no reason why this should n’t apply to people working at the @entity3			1
’ but a @entity3 spokesman said it had to honour the confidentiality of the severance deal , which prevents the individual being named			2
details of the payment were obtained under a @entity36 which also showed that the average payout at the @entity3 between 2009 and 2012 was £ 48,434 – some £ 6,000 more than the average across @entity39 , according to @entity40			1
the majority of redundancies are in response to @entity45 budget cuts across @entity39 ( stock image pictured ) explaining the size of the payoff , a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ as a government department , the @entity3 is bound by @entity52 - wide pension rules			1
' this severance payment to a senior employee was made under the old @entity52 pension rules , which contractually entitled long - standing employees to up to six years ’ pay if they were made redundant			0
’ he added : ‘ the @entity3 had no discretion in the size of this payment			2
following the reform to the pension rules , an employee of similar seniority and length of service who was made redundant today would receive a much smaller compensation payment			0
' this payment included a confidentiality clause and we are legally bound not to name the former employee			0
’ the majority of the 1,282 @entity3 payoffs are in response to @entity45 budget cuts across @entity39			1
a @entity3 spokesman added : ‘ following the government ’s comprehensive spending review in 2010 , the @entity3 , like most government departments , has been required to make significant savings in its overall budget			2
’ he added : ‘ the savings will inevitably involve a reduction in staff through voluntary routes and we have offered a series of exit schemes since 2010			0
' these have enabled us to reduce senior staff and managers and headquarters employees , while protecting frontline services			0
the scheme is in full accordance with @entity98 guidance			0

average redundancy payout at the @entity3 between 2009 and 2012 was £ 48,434
figure is £ 6,000 more than the average across @entity39 , according to @entity40
majority of payoffs are in response to @entity45 budget cuts across @entity39
