any hopes @entity0 may have had of kick - starting a survival battle on sunday were swiftly banished as they went down 38 - 7 to @entity2 at @entity3			1
the @entity2 scored six tries - and had the try - scoring bonus point wrapped up by half - time - as they registered their biggest @entity7 win for eight years			1
three of those tries came in a seven - minute first - half spell and effectively ended any hopes @entity0 may have had of sparking a fightback			2
@entity13 of @entity2 scores a try during the @entity7 clash with @entity0 @entity2 's first - half hat - trick came shortly after the visitors squandered an early chance , when big @entity22 number eight @entity20 broke from the base of the scrum			1
his offload to @entity27 should have led to a score , but the flanker could not hold the pass			0
it proved a costly miss , with @entity2 stepping up the pace to score those three tries in seven minutes to lead 19 - 0			1
@entity35 nearly cut through on the 22 to set up a series of forward drives and @entity38 was stopped right on the try line			0
@entity40 of @entity2 challenged by @entity41 during the 38 - 7 victory for the home side that led to the opening try by @entity40 , with @entity13 picking up from the base of the scrum and flicking the ball out to @entity40 , who stepped inside @entity49 and outside @entity41 to score			1
@entity2 were quickly back on the attack when @entity0 failed to clear a long kick and then conceded a penalty which the @entity2 put in the corner and drove prop @entity54 over for a try converted by @entity35			2
the third try followed when @entity40 blasted through and passed inside overhead for @entity58 to send in @entity59 and @entity35 again converted for 19 - 0			2
@entity35 went over to score one of @entity2 's three first - half tries in the win over @entity0 @entity63 briefly raised @entity0 hopes by brilliantly snapping up @entity66 's clever dink down the touchline to score , and @entity66 landed the extras for 19 - 7 in 24th minute			1
however , @entity2 's superiority in the rolling maul was demonstrated again when @entity71 was driven over for a try in the 33rd minute to give the @entity2 a 24 - 7 half - time lead and the try - scoring bonus point			0
much as they had done in the first half , @entity0 started the second period well but failed to make it count and they again paid the price			0
@entity13 took a pass from @entity79 and galloped 50 yards up the touchline , bumping off @entity63 and @entity81 for a try which @entity35 converted in the 55th minute for 31 - 7			0
@entity83 of @entity2 rides the challenge of @entity85 ( right ) as @entity0 fell to another loss both sides made use of their benches in the second half and the continuity went right out of the game - particularly in @entity2 's case , but @entity0 were unable to profit , and their frustration was never more evident than when @entity95 had a chance to score only for the ball to be passed behind him and straight into touch			2
that ruined the chance of a try - scoring homecoming to the club he started his career with 19 years ago , and on his last appearance here after announcing his retirement at the end of the season			0
almost inevitably , with three minutes left @entity112 snapped up a loose ball and @entity114 slipped it to @entity35 , who scored with an outside run and converted his own try for 38 - 7 .			0

the @entity2 scored six tries for their biggest league win in eight years
four first - half tries put the home side 19 - 0 up at the break
@entity0 remain bottom of the @entity7 with 13 straight defeats
