our human ancestors did come from @entity3 but left the continent to spread across the world via a different route than first thought , scientists have revealed			2
a six - year study mapping genetic patterns found that people who ended up in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 got there by crossing the sea to @entity15 around 70,000 years ago			0
scientists had thought that humankind left for other continents in a northern direction through @entity21 's @entity20 region but now it seems they wandered further south , probably via @entity23			1
evidence shows sea levels were probably low enough for the first people to cross from the horn of @entity3 into @entity15 via the @entity30 's @entity29 straits			0
from there it seems that southern @entity12 countries like @entity34 were key stopping points from where humans spread across the rest of the world			1
settlers followed a coastal route down into east @entity12 and @entity13 while others burst upwards into @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity11 and @entity45			2
researchers have found that the @entity34 populations had more genetic diversity , showing they have a greater age than @entity11 or east @entity12 , which they say proves their theory			1
base : the rich variety of people in @entity34 has led scientists to believe it is from there that many humans spread across the world after leaving @entity3 change : it has long been thought that humans travelled through the @entity20 in @entity21 , pictured , but this has now been discounted ' evolutionary history shows that human populations likely originated in @entity3 , and the @entity66 , the most extensive survey of human population genetic data to date , suggests where they went next : modern humans migrated out of @entity3 via a southern route through @entity15 , rather than a northern route by way of @entity21 , ' a spokesman for @entity76 said , who were involved in the research			1
studies of human genomes have shown that our ancestors emerged from @entity3 roughly 150,000 to 200,000 years ago scientists used a new complicated research technique to study the path of the humans			1
called recombination , they broke up dna molecules and recombined them to form new pairs			1
by doing this they can see the relationships with humans today and 70,000 years ago			0
@entity66 director dr @entity94 said their techniques could provide ' greater insights into the migratory history of our species			0
' nearly 500,000 indigenous and members of the general public have taken part and given dna samples			0
' over the past six years , we â€™ve had the opportunity to gather and analyse genetic data around the world at a scale and level of detail that has never been done before , ' said report co-author @entity112 , senior manager at @entity76 's @entity113 ' when we started , our goal was to bring science expeditions into the modern era to further a deeper understanding of human roots and diversity			0
' with evidence that the genetic diversity in southern @entity34 is closer to @entity3 than that of @entity11 , this suggests that other fields of research such as archaeology and anthropology should look for additional evidence on the migration route of early humans to further explore this theory			2

our ancestors headed into @entity34 via @entity23 before wandering further east and north
researchers used complicated new dna *procedure* ' recombination '
