by @entity0 for city dwellers , a spot of rain can bring the end to any good hair day			1
and it seems the problem 's no different for those living on the wild side , as one lion proved when he awoke to a serious case of bed - head			2
unfortunately for the animal , @entity17 , his embarrassment was documented by a group of wildlife photographers at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
tiny the lion was left feeling a little flat when a spot of drizzle ruined his luscious golden mane at the @entity20 in @entity21 photographer @entity27 was able to capture the animal 's melancholy as he woke up from a nap			1
' it was a miserable wet day and this lion brought a smile to our faces as his normally glorious mane was soaked and flat - he looked completely fed up , ' the 43 - year - old said			2
' i was really pleased to get the shot as it was almost the first one of the day and i knew it was a good moment and technically good shot			0
' @entity17 , who lives at the sanctuary with his two brothers , @entity44 and @entity45 , was born with a digestion problem causing him to regurgitate food and not grow properly			1
after having a stomach valve corrected , he has made a full recovery and is now a normal size			0
that 's better : tiny looking his usual preened self ( left ) and his two brothers , @entity55 and @entity44 ( left ) cuddle up on the sanctuary where all three moved in 2005 the @entity57 were born at the @entity58 in 2003 and were moved to the big cat sanctuary in @entity21 at the age of two ' he 's called @entity61 because he kept regurgitating his food when young so he did n't grow at the normal rate			1
he had an operation to correct a stomach valve and things got better for him			0
' he has had some hairy moments , when in 2008 some horse mane got stuck in his intestines and he almost died , ' added mr @entity27 , who gives workshops on wildlife photography at the sanctuary			0
' he had an operation where they had to cut out almost 5 foot of intestine but luckily lived to tell the tale			0
' despite these troubles he 's still an impressive lion and full of character			0
