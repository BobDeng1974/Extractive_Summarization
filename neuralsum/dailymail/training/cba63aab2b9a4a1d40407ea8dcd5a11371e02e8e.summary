by @entity0 published : 20:24 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 11 march 2013 @entity2 chief sir @entity1 is to be summoned for another bruising clash with mps as it emerged that a cabinet minister has joined calls for him to be sacked			1
sir @entity1 , who is under pressure to resign in the wake of the @entity12 scandal , will be called before the @entity13 to discuss a string of disastrous @entity2 it projects			1
but a source on the committee told the @entity18 that @entity4 ‘ will want to ask him ’ about his expenses , which totalled just under £ 50,000 last year			1
scrutiny : sir @entity1 , @entity2 chief executive , will face questions about his £ 50,000 expenses when he goes before mps to account for the health service 's it expenditure , according to a source this was on top of his £ 211,000 salary , £ 20,000 bonus and around £ 47,000 of ‘ benefits in kind ’			1
until 2011 , he was also given a taxpayer - funded sum of just under £ 60,000 to pay for a rented flat in the capital – an arrangement attacked by cabinet office minister @entity37 as a ‘ relic of the past ’			0
yesterday it emerged mr @entity37 has argued for weeks that sir @entity1 ’s departure is necessary if accountability is to mean anything in the public sector			2
ministers fear a critical focus on sir @entity1 ’s pay and perks could prove the final straw following weeks of controversy since an inquiry found up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the @entity12 trust			1
sir @entity1 was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for @entity55 for ten months at the height of the failings in care at the trust			2
and the prime minister is said to have privately told colleagues he will not tie himself closely to sir @entity61 after being warned that damaging revelations are to come			0
a @entity64 source said : ‘ @entity37 has been one of the voices telling @entity66 that @entity1 should go , from the point of view of civil service accountability more than anything else			0
’ giving evidence to @entity72 , sir @entity1 insisted his health authority had ‘ no idea ’ about the problems at @entity76			2
but at a private meeting of @entity80 mps this week , only one thought he should keep his @entity81 , who took over as health secretary in last year ’s reshuffle , will have to implement complex structural reforms drawn up by his predecessor and sir @entity1			0
a government source said that , as a result , he was ‘ in thrall ’ to the @entity2 boss			0
it has also emerged that sir @entity1 could face a private prosecution for corporate manslaughter over the deaths at @entity76			1
retired investment banker @entity95 has applied to @entity97 magistrates in @entity98 for permission to prosecute sir @entity1 for corporate manslaughter , misconduct in public office , perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .			0

sir @entity1 to face questions on £ 50,000 expenses
he already gets a £ 211,000 salary , plus bonus and benefits
sir @entity1 is under pressure over 1,200 patient deaths
