the explosive @entity2 torture report could open the floodgates for costly lawsuits against the @entity5 , @entity6 and any other countries complicit with the @entity10 's so - called ' enhanced interrogation ' programme , top lawyers have warned			1
experts who have spent years working at @entity5 detention centres said yesterday 's report did not contain any surprises , but suggested that now detainees ' torture allegations are supported by an official government report , claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action			1
human rights lawyers are currently working their way through the 525 - page report , which confirmed the existence of secret @entity10 prisons around the world , in the hope of finding material that could provide the breakthrough needed to revive dormant and failed lawsuits launched by detainees			1
this is largely because , until now , the @entity5 government has insisted that all details of the detentions and related extraordinary rendition hearings were state secrets , and therefore not valid evidence			1
but now that many of the individuals ' allegations have been confirmed as true by the @entity2 report , a huge amount of new and official material can be used to back future claims			1
' one of the tragedies about this is the attempt to find redress , ' @entity63 , a senior official at @entity64 told @entity70			0
' judges have accepted the state secrets claim			1
now it will be much harder to do that when we all have access to a 500 - page public report that details a lot of this , ' she added			2
chained and kneeling : @entity82 and @entity83 detainees captured in @entity84 after the 9/11 attacks were transferred to the @entity5 @entity86 at @entity37 in @entity87 the chances of an @entity5 court reopening civil or criminal charges against senior @entity10 officials remains slim , as the @entity92 has already carried out its own investigations into the agency , which only led to the prosecution of low - level employees and contractors			1
however a far more realistic prospect it that former detainees could launch legal action against @entity103 administration officials in @entity105 courts under the rules of universal jurisdiction			0
@entity109 jurisdiction allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed , and regardless of the accused 's nationality , country of residence , or any other relation with the prosecuting entity			0
' after reviewing this report , we will give consideration to reopening petitions or filing new petitions in @entity105 courts under the principles of universal jurisdiction , ' said @entity128 - the legal director of the @entity129 , which has previously represented @entity37 detainees			1
' the comprehensiveness and detail of this declassified report is thorough evidence of a criminal conspiracy of @entity5 officials to torture dozens of human beings , ' he added			1
global : at its height , the @entity10 program included secret prisons in countries including @entity84 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 â€” locations that are referred to only by color - themed codes in the report @entity6 is expected to be among the countries where former detainees launch legal action over the government 's alleged complicity in the @entity10 's ' enhanced interrogation techniques '			1
one example would be in the case of @entity159 @entity158 politician @entity157 who , in a joint @entity161 - @entity10 operation in 2003 , was snatched along with his wife from their home in @entity165 , @entity142			0
@entity157 was flown back to @entity159 where he faced years of torture in one of then - leader @entity170 's notorious prisons as punishment for his conservative views			0
@entity173 , who represents several people who were rendered to @entity10 - run prisons in the early 2000s , told @entity176 : ' the @entity6 government has always said those cases can not go to trial because ' it will damage our relations with the @entity5 ' ' but if the @entity2 is involved in a very detailed examination of torture , that excuse by the @entity6 government is exposed for the kabuki that it is , ' he added			1
threat : former @entity37 detainee @entity188 is the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the torture report earlier an @entity193 man who was held at @entity37 without charge for three years has become the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the report			1
@entity197 was arrested in @entity198 in october 2001 and deported to @entity199 , where he says he was tortured for five months before being transported to @entity200 in @entity87			0
mr @entity197 said he was happy that yesterday 's @entity202 report concluded that the @entity10 's use of ' enhanced interrogation ' techniques on suspected terrorists amounted to torture and had failed to produce any information that could be used to prevent imminent terror attacks			1
he also warned that he intends to reopen his legal cases against the @entity5 and @entity193 governments - the latter of which mr @entity197 claims was effectively complicit in torture when it failed to prevent his extraordinary rendition from @entity198 to @entity199			1
mr @entity197 has been attempting to sue the @entity199 government over his rendition , detention and alleged torture , but his case collapsed just two weeks ago when the @entity193 government refused to verify that the documents he was using to present his case to the @entity225 court were official			2
his lawyers had been given five days to present the verification , but a lawyer for the @entity193 government told the court that they have invoked their right to diplomatic immunity and refused to take part in the hearing			0
the documents mr @entity197 had wanted to present in the @entity225 court had already been accepted in @entity193 investigations and legal proceedings to prove that both the @entity193 and @entity199 governments were aware of where he had been taken after the @entity10 transported him from @entity198			2
a 2011 investigation carried out by @entity193 's inspector - general of @entity241 concluded that officials in both @entity193 and @entity199 were aware of his detention there , and resulted in mr @entity197 been paid an undisclosed amount of money to drop his case against them			0
comment : @entity250 told @entity251 this morning that @entity10 ' torture ' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of @entity256 and that releasing details of it would n't help mr @entity197 believes that the release of the @entity10 torture report gives him enough grounds to reopen his case against both the @entity199 and @entity193 governments , and also to pursue new claims against the @entity5 itself			1
the 59 - year - old was arrested by the @entity10 in @entity198 just one month after the september 11 , 2001 @entity267 attacks in @entity268			0
he was held and interrogated in @entity199 for a year before being transported to @entity37 , where he was detained for three years without charge before eventually being released			0
the @entity193 government were subsequently forced to charter a a $ 500,000 plane to return mr @entity197 to home soil as the @entity5 banned him leaving the country on a commercial flight , despite the fact he has never been charged with terrorism offences			2
horror : @entity250 was then held for nearly three years at the @entity5 military prison in @entity37 in @entity87 ( pictured ) , where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation this morning a former @entity6 inmate of @entity37 said @entity10 ' torture ' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of @entity256 and that cataloguing it would n't help			1
@entity250 also said the release of the report , which included graphic details of ' enhanced interrogation ' techniques used by the @entity10 , would do nothing to assuage anger about such actions across the @entity295 world			2
' i do n't think it will be teaching us anything we did n't already know , ' @entity250 said			0
' it does n't make anything better			0
' he said examples cited in the report of brutality by @entity10 interrogators at secret prisons around the world ' can only produce one result - false evidence , more hatred '			2
@entity250 was then held for nearly three years at the @entity5 military prison in @entity37 in @entity87 , where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation			0
he also claimed to have been kept in solitary confinement for almost two years			0
during his detention , @entity250 said he was subjected to the sound of a woman screaming in a nearby cell whom he believed to be his wife under torture			0
he said he was told he 'd be sent to @entity324 if he did n't cooperate , and that he saw two people being punched and kicked to death by @entity5 soldiers			0
a @entity330 envoy and human rights groups have demanded that senior officials in the administration of @entity103 are prosecuted over the ' brutal ' interrogation of @entity82 suspects			2
@entity335 on @entity64 and counter-terrorism @entity336 said it was clear that criminal techniques revealed yesterday in the @entity2 so - called ' torture report ' , had been a ' clear policy orchestrated at a high level '			1
mr @entity336 said senior officials from the @entity103 administration who had been involved in planning and sanctioning the crimes must face legal action			0
he added that @entity10 and @entity5 government officials responsible for torture such as waterboarding should also be prosecuted			1
' as a matter of international law , the @entity5 is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice , ' he said in a statement made from @entity354			0
' the @entity5 attorney general is under a legal duty to bring criminal charges against those responsible , ' mr @entity336 added			2
@entity64 executive director @entity359 said that the @entity10 's actions were criminal ' and can never be justified ' , adding : unless this important truth - telling process leads to prosecution of officials , torture will remain a ' policy option ' for future presidents			2

experts say yesterday 's @entity2 torture report provides *wealth* of new and official material to support fresh legal claims by @entity10 detainees
human rights lawyers hope to revive dozens of dormant and failed suits
previously @entity5 government insisted detention details were state secrets
