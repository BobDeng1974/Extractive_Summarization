@entity8 's father described him as ' an absolutely brilliant child ' and that since his passing his house had been ' extremely quiet without him ' the inquest was told it was a well known dare among school children to see if they could walk across the raised cast iron pipe in order to get to the other side of the canal			1
' when they got towards the bridge there were some railings , ' detective constable @entity67 of @entity68 told the hearing			2
' it 's believed one said there was a gap in the railings and climbed through			2
it was sometimes a dare to see if they could walk across			0
the three boys decided to walk across , there was a conversation who will go first			0
' listening to the children it seems to be a dare possibly between children			0
' she told the inquest that @entity8 went second and he and one of the friends walked with their backs to the wall as they made their way across			1
' there were rivets on the pipe which they had to step over and the boys spoke of the pipe being ' a bit slippy			0
' the officer added : ' as they approached the far end of the bridge one said that he is about to climb down onto the opposite ledge and hears a shout from @entity8 and he falls into the water			2
he strikes himself on the bank of the canal before falling backwards into the water			0
' @entity8 's father , @entity112 , and his stepmother @entity113 lay flowers at the scene following his death more members of @entity8 's family pay their respects to the 11 - year - old , who died in april last year the boys then climbed down and on seeing @entity8 in the water screamed for help , as one ran to find assistance			1
@entity126 , who heard the children 's ' pleas said : ' i could see a body lying face down in the canal			2
i grabbed the child and said , " help me get him out "			0
' he added that @entity8 had appeared ' lifeless ' , with his eyes closed , and did not appear to be breathing			2
as he waited for paramedics to arrive , mr @entity126 began cpr and @entity8 was then taken to the @entity139			2
he was placed in a medically induced coma but suffered a cardiac arrest and died later that night			0
tests showed he died from drowning and a head injury			0
the @entity32 pipe , which was fitted in 1903 , had remained exposed to danger from children 's pranks for more than 110 years despite maintenance work being carried out three times between 2001 and 2006 these protective iron shields on either side of the pipe were finally installed by @entity41 24 hours after the tragedy on april 22 last year to stop children attempting as similar challenge @entity8 's father @entity112 told the inquest that as a child he had crossed the pipe , as had his own father , but he did not know @entity8 had been scaling it			1
he told the inquest that had he known of his son 's activities he would have ' told him off '			1
' i did n't want him to do it , obviously if i 'd found out i would have really told him off , ' mr @entity8 said			1
he added that despite the iron shield being installed , children could still jump down onto the pipe			0
' that shield that they have put on , you can still climb round , ' he said			0
' why ca n't they slope the pipe so there would be no climbing at all , there would be no access			0
if sloped you have no chance to get onto it			0
you can still drop onto it			0
' tributes left at the scene where @entity8 died in a statement read to the court , mr @entity8 described his son as ' an absolutely brilliant child ' and that since his passing his house had been , ' extremely quiet without him '			1
he added that @entity8 had ' absolutely loved life ' and had been an outdoors type of child			2
year 7 pupil @entity8 had only started at his secondary school the day before his death			1
representatives from the @entity41 said they had believed that the pipe had been underground and was not aware that it was in fact exposed until after the accident - despite work being carried out at the location in 2001 , 2004 and 2006			2
' some of our crossings have contact details around the site , this one did n't , ' said @entity41 's engineering policy manager @entity208			0
' you would n't have known who to contact			0
' the inquest was told there had been no complaints about the pipe to @entity215 or the @entity41			1
coroner mr @entity216 recorded a conclusion of accidental death said he would be contacting other gas and utility companies to report the incident in order to prevent similar tragedies			1
he added : ' there may be exposed , raised pipe works for which you are responsible either attached to bridges or otherwise , that are accessible to members of the public			0
' ' the loss of a child is the hardest to bear			0
we who have heard the evidence today ca n't possibly appreciate your grief , we can only share it with you			0
after the inquest @entity239 , speaking on behalf of @entity8 's family , said : ' today has been a great ordeal for them and understandably it has n't actually allayed any other disquiet about the circumstances that led to the accident			1
they are glad that @entity41 are now , albeit too late for @entity8 , taking steps to prevent it from happening again			2
these unguarded pipe crossings are just an accident waiting to happen			2
' @entity41 said : ' we have installed protection on the pipe over @entity56 and have carried out a thorough review of all the other pipe crossings we own to see if there is a need for additional measures to be taken to prevent access			1
we will share details of our review with the wider gas industry			0
' our investigations found we had no record of anyone contacting us or our predecessor companies to report an issue with children climbing on this pipe			0
