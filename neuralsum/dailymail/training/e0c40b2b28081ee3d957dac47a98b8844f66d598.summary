by @entity0 lost boy : @entity2 , 13 , had just started school in the @entity4 when he was lost by @entity6 staff @entity6 has been accused of abandoning a 13 - year - old passenger , leaving him to wander around an airport alone and without his passport			1
@entity2 , a @entity10 boy who goes to school in @entity12 , said goodbye to his parents in @entity14 and caught a flight to @entity16			1
however , when he landed at @entity17 his guardian , actor @entity19 was shocked to find that the youngster had been allowed to walk off the plane by himself , and to roam the airport on his own			1
despite @entity2 being booked on to a £ 60 - a - time @entity25 chaperone service , his minders at @entity17 did not realise he had gone missing			1
alone in the airport , the lost boy sent confused text messages from the terminal , seeking help			0
one message said ' i 'm underground and i do n't know where to go ' , with another saying ' i 'm lost and i do n't have my passport '			0
mr @entity19 , 63 , rushed to raise the alarm when he realised @entity2 was on his own , but staff unsympathetic brushed him off as a ' teenage tearaway ' , and said there were so many children on the plane they had no way of keeping track of them			1
after 45 minutes , a member of airport staff found @entity2 and brought him through passport control , but mr @entity19 said he was ' terrified ' while waiting for him to return , and that the boy ' could have been molested ' or abducted by anybody in the airport			1
it was the boy 's first time flying by himself			2
@entity6 had made an announcement during the flight that all children flying alone should stay on board and wait to be met			2
safe : @entity2 at @entity17 after he had made it through passport control nervous : mr and mrs @entity62 , pictured with @entity2 , were nervous about using the accompanied flight service to send their son from @entity10 to the @entity4 however , @entity2 followed a group of more confident young travellers off the plane , and when they later disappeared he was left with nowhere to go			1
mr @entity19 , who turned to the @entity69 after his complaint to @entity6 hit a dead end , said : ' @entity2 goes to school in @entity73 but lives abroad			2
' he had started at boarding school this term , and had flown back over the half term to see his parents , who were nervous about him flying alone			2
' ' i went to the airport on sunday night and waited until i saw his flight had arrived , and texted him to ask how he was			2
' i received a reply which said he would be out in around 20 minutes , but after some time he sent another message asking me which terminal i was at			0
' relief : @entity2 makes his way back to school after his ordeal ' when i realised he was on his own , i told him to find somebody in uniform to look after him ' ' i then headed to to the office that deals with the accompanied flights - a tawdry , miserable affair - and told them " there 's been a terrible mistake , little @entity2 has got off the plane and there 's nobody with him			1
" ' ' then a woman , who i was not talking to at the time , said " teenage tearaways , what can you do about that ? " , which i thought was a disgraceful response			1
' she asked how old he was and i said he was 13 , to which she said " there you are - a teenage tearaway			0
" ' shocked : actor @entity19 , who is @entity2 's guardian , said he was terrified that something would happen to the boy , and that @entity6 should provide a full refund mr @entity19 said the staff were unable to find out who had sent whom to collect @entity2 , and they were unaware the teenager had gone missing , until they were told			1
after seeing him safely to school , mr @entity19 complained to @entity6 , but was passed between call handlers and kept on hold for almost an hour			0
mr @entity19 said : ' i told them there had been a terrible breach of security - anybody could have just grabbed him			0
i was terrified , he could have been molested by somebody			0
' i said that they were n't taking this seriously , but i was told that they had " followed the procedures "			0
' his parents had paid $ 100 a shot for this service - and how would they feel if something happened ? ' the service guarantees that they accompany the child - at no stage are they ever allowed to be on their own			1
' i want @entity6 to acknowledge what they did and change their procedures so that it does n't happen to anybody else			0
' i also think they should provide a full refund , and something for @entity2 to make it up to him			2
but after they heard my complaint @entity6 said they had " done all that we can " ' @entity2 , the eldest of two children , attends @entity149 in @entity150 , where he was sent for the first time this year by his parents , @entity153 and @entity154			1
mr @entity19 knows @entity2 and his family because his son tutors children abroad			2
foreign children who study in the @entity4 require a family member or friend to be responsible for them while they study , a role which he agreed to fulfill for @entity162			0
mr @entity19 is also a well - known actor , who has recently appeared in about @entity163 as @entity164 , @entity165 as the @entity166 , and also featured in the 100th episode of @entity168			0
a @entity6 spokesman said staff were looking into the claims made by mr @entity19			0
' we treat matters of this nature extremely seriously , and we are currently investigating the claim			0
