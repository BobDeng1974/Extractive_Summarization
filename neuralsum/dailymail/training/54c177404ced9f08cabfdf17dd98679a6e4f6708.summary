' a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system , caused by an abnormal rhythm			1
contrary to popular belief , a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack			1
a cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system			1
it is caused by an abnormal rhythm , or arrhythmia			0
anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning			1
symptoms include unresponsiveness , loss of consciousness , lack of pulse and stopping breathing			0
in contrast , a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart 's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked			0
this causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert			0
in the hospital , mr @entity5 ' petrified relatives were asked by doctors if he had taken any drugs before the fit as they were unable to find the cause of the problem			1
but doctors later discovered that mr @entity5 was born with an extra pathway between the upper and lower chambers of his heart			1
he said : ' they we 're struggling to find out why i had the fit but they eventually found out it was something i was born with			2
' doctors had to ask my mum if i had been drinking or if i had taken any drugs that could have made me ill. ' but they apologised to my mum when they knew the condition was something i was born with			2
' i 'm just glad to have survived the whole thing and be able to be with my family and friends again			0
' i definitely appreciate things a lot more now			0
' i feel incredibly lucky to be alive , let alone to be back in work and playing football again			1
