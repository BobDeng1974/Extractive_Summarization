a father and son were killed when their light aircraft broke up in mid-air and fell from the sky ' like a stone ' , an inquest has heard			1
@entity8 , 75 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , and son @entity11 , 39 , from @entity12 , died when their twin - seat plane crashed at @entity15 , in central @entity16 , on june 29 2012			1
the plane crashed 20 minutes after taking off from nearby @entity18 as they flew to the south of @entity16			1
the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
@entity8 , 75 ( left ) and his son @entity11 , 39 ( right ) were killed when their light aircraft crashed over @entity16 pilot mr @entity26 , a video producer , and his father , a farmer , had been heading to the southern town of @entity30 in their white @entity31 450			1
they hit restricted airspace , which they did not have permission to travel through , at around 4,000ft ( 1,219m ) and mr @entity37 attempted a 180 - degree turn to leave it			1
the pair were in thick cloud at the time and may have suffered from spatial disorientation , causing mr @entity37 to become unaware the aircraft was nosediving , the inquest heard			2
he attempted to pull sharply out of the manoeuvre but this led to a sudden shift in pressure in the light aircraft - causing first the left wing and then the right to break off in mid-air			1
@entity54 and @entity55 heard the airspace could have been restricted due to military operations , or a number of other unspecified reasons			2
dr @entity60 , coroner for @entity54 and @entity10 , concluded both men died as a result of multiple injuries in ' accidental ' deaths			0
she said : ' ( they ) were in a light aircraft which left @entity18 at around 12.06pm on june 29 2012 on its way to @entity30			1
' at approximately 12.44pm the left wing separated from the fuselage and shortly after that the right wing as the aircraft was subjected to an increased load as it climbed at 4,500ft in an attempt to avoid a restricted area			1
' there was low cloud and bad weather and the plane broke up and crashed into a water outlet in @entity15			1
' a @entity31 450 like the plane which crashed as mr @entity80 and his son flew to the south of @entity16 ( stock ) dr @entity60 said an @entity86 helicopter had been in the same airspace at a similar time but there was no collision with the aircraft			1
the two men had set off from @entity93 before landing at @entity18 to refuel , leaving at 12.06pm to head for @entity30			0
@entity16 air traffic controllers had warned mr @entity37 , who had 56 hours 45 minutes of flying experience , of scattered cloud at 2,400ft ( 732m ) at around 12.20pm			1
at 12.45pm , the controller heard a background noise on the frequency and tried to make contact but could not reach mr @entity8 or his father			1
witnesses heard the sound of the aircraft 's engine revving before seeing it circling out of control and the left wing flying off , followed by other pieces which fell to the ground			2
@entity111 , who worked near the crash site , said : ' the left wing was falling into the air and the plane turning like a whirlpool			0
' it fell like a stone			2
the plane came down directly to @entity119 in a spin			0
after it had hit the ground i heard the sound of a collision but no further explosion			2
' elsewhere , school assistant @entity127 was called by pupils in the playground to reports of the plane falling from the sky			2
' looking up in the direction they showed me , i saw what i thought was a small white aircraft , ' he said			0
' the engine was racing as if it was jammed			0
the aircraft quickly started losing bits			0
other bits , some bigger , started falling off			0
the rest of the plane fell in one piece almost immediately			0
' the inquest heard that data gathered from mr @entity8 ' @entity145 , which had a navigation app running , showed the aircraft had attempted to turn round shortly before the nosedive			1
@entity149 , senior inspector at the @entity151 @entity150 , said the plane had entered restricted air space and could have been trying to leave it			2
' the pilot may have realised he was in restricted air space and was trying get back out again , ' he said			0
' it was descending significantly and the aircraft speed would be increasing			0
the pilot realised he was descending and was trying to rectify that situation			0
' if that was done quite abruptly that would have put strain on the wings			0

@entity8 , 75 , and son @entity11 , 39 , died when their light aircraft crashed
plane broke up in mid-air and fell from the sky ' like a stone ' over @entity16
hit restricted airspace and mr @entity26 tried a 180 - degree turn to leave it
but his attempt to pull out of manoeuvre led to a sudden shift in pressure
caused wings to break off in mid-air and plane nose - dived to the ground
