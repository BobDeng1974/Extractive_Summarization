@entity0 told @entity1 on tuesday that he was n't mistaken when he said @entity3 owner @entity2 ' got set up ' by a vindictive girlfriend , but blames partisan media outlets for turning the offhand comment into a publicity firestorm			1
' it was a total set - up , ' he insisted during an interview in his @entity11 office			2
' the girl set him up , in my opinion			1
that 's what i 'm saying			0
he was set up by her			0
' @entity0 first made the claim during a @entity20 interview monday morning , during a segment in which he also called @entity2 's words about black people ' despicable			1
' at the end of that interview , he declared that @entity26 , who allegedly made the now - infamous recording , was ' the girlfriend from hell , and that @entity2 ' got set up by a very , very bad girlfriend , let 's face it			1
' ' she was baiting him , ' @entity0 added , ' and she 's a terrible human being			2
and he gave horrible answers , and disgusting answers			0
' i was criticizing him , ' @entity0 insisted tuedsay			0
' but in addition , i was criticizing him for having this girlfriend , who was bad			0
she was bad news , okay ? ' on @entity20 , @entity0 had speculated that @entity2 was ' close to incompetent ' and ' led along by somebody who was so obviously looking to do harm to him			1
' on tuesday he blamed the previous day 's negative attention on ' dishonest reporters			0
' ' it shows the dishonesty of much of the media , ' @entity0 told @entity1 , ' because i gave ' em a long segment about @entity2 , about how despicable it is – what he said – and harsh action has to be taken , and just at the end i said , " and by the way , he has a girlfriend from hell			1
" ' ' it was a total set - up , ' @entity0 insisted tuesday			1
' the girl set him up , in my opinion			1
that 's what i 'm saying			0
' he blamed @entity2 for choosing ' the girlfriend from hell ' ' i always get a disproportionate amount of publicity , ' he acknowledged , ' but i find that if i were a @entity79 , and i made the exact same statements that i made about @entity2 – and i 'm not a fan , you understand that – it would have been treated much different , of course			1
... it probably would n't have been a story			0
' @entity0 , who has nibbled around the edges of presidential politics , told @entity1 that it was still ' too early ' for him to decide whether to make a @entity89 run			1
he insisted that he would only do it ' for love of country , ' @entity2 has been widely condemned after friday 's release of the audio recording , in which a voice sounding like his tells ms. @entity26 that she can not bring black people to his basketball games or be photographed with them			1
the male voice can be heard specifically talking about @entity100 – telling @entity26 , who is black and @entity101 , that he does n't want her ' associating with black people			0
' ' what he said was terrible and despicable and very strong action is going to be taken			0
there ’s no question about it , ' @entity0 said on @entity20			2
he added that in his opinion , @entity2 ' could be out of it , frankly , based on his actions			2
he could be pretty much out of it in terms of his whole mentality			0
' the @entity114 said tuesday that it wants a meeting with @entity45 to discuss the episode			0
@entity117 : @entity2 spotted leaving a @entity118 with his wife @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121			0

' the organization 's @entity121 chapter has withdrawn its decision to give @entity2 a lifetime achievement award , and returned money he donated			2
@entity2 also made less public donations to the @entity141 in @entity121 , to the city 's @entity142 , and to the @entity144			2
the @entity144 told @entity1 on monday that it would not return the $ 50,000 @entity2 donated , since it was earmarked for scholarships			1
bizarre : @entity26 has refused to speak to the media since the scandal broke over the weekend			0

@entity0 told @entity20 he was disgusted by the @entity3 owner 's *audiotaped* slam on *african* - americans
but he also said the woman who allegedly made the recording was ' the girlfriend from hell ' and that @entity2 ' got set up '
now he tells @entity1 exclusively that he was n't mistaken : ' the girl set him up , in my opinion . she set him up . that 's what i 'm saying '
@entity0 *complained* that some media outlets ignored the scorn he heaped on @entity165 for being a racist – and for choosing the *wrong* lover
' i were a @entity79 , and i made the exact same statements ... it would have been treated much different , ' he *jabbed*
