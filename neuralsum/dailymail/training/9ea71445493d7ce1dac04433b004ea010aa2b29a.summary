by @entity0 he 's created everything from ice castles to oriental palaces and numbers @entity6 and @entity7 among his clients - and now well - heeled parents are asking celebrity event planner @entity10 to create equally lavish parties for children too young to have a clue what 's going on			1
last month , @entity10 created an @entity15 and @entity17 event for a pair of twins celebrating their first birthday - and charged the parents £ 70,000 for the privilege			1
the party took place in a marquee erected in the family 's garden in @entity26			2
while it might sound extravagant , @entity10 says it 's by no means an unusual event ( ' we do about one a month ' ) and revealed that non-celebrities tend to splash out far more on private parties than their a-list counterparts			2
the birthday party included elaborate props such as these flamingos ( centre ) and flowerbeds filled with windmills the party had a combined @entity40 and @entity15 theme - hence forests of polka dot toad stools inside the marquee lavish though the children 's party was , it 's by no means the most extravagant event @entity49 has worked on ' [ the 70k party ] was about a month ago and for a private client , ' he explained in an exclusive interview with @entity53			1
' we were asked for a mix of @entity15 and @entity40 , so it was all themed around them			2
it was very colourful , with lots of props and lots of lighting effects			2
' you 'd be surprised by some of the things we have , ' he added			0
' it 's more to make that child feel totally special even though they do n't know whats happening			0
the bigger they can have it , the better			0
' if it had been a for a 21st or something , it would n't have been such a talking point			0
' along with props and special lighting , the £ 70,000 bill also covered the cost of a full buffet , complete with beautifully decorated treats , and a vast @entity15 tiered cake			1
the tables were decorated with bouquets of yellow and purple blooms and had centrepieces inspired by the @entity89 's tea party the buffet included a three - tier birthday cake and plates of beautifully decorated nibbles - all with an @entity15 theme @entity10 aims to make sure no corner goes undecorated and that the client 's dream design is realised as they imagined it @entity10 says parents want to create magical memories for their children and that he now does a party a month for younger clients the @entity15 interior theme gave the marquee an unabashedly girly feel @entity10 , who began his career as an interior architect and has studied interior design , is no stranger to lavish requests			1
with clients that include @entity113 and @entity114 , as well as @entity7 and @entity6 , @entity10 has worked for some of the biggest names on the a-list but says it 's the creative challenge rather than the opportunity to rub shoulders with celebrities that drives him			1
' it 's definitely the idea of being more creative that appeals to me , ' he says			0
' it 's very much about getting to what clients really want and bringing that fantasy to life			0
' are there any limits to what he 'll create ? ' not really , he says			0
' we 're becoming more worldwide now and we 've done events for the @entity139 for the last two years but as long as events are creative and the client has a bit of an imagination , there is no minimum and no maximum			0
' for more information and pictures , see @entity149 paper lampshades were used to give the outside of the marquee a fantastical appearance with the help of flowerbeds crammed with colourful windmills from the outside , the marquee appears to be part of @entity160 - inside , it 's @entity161 come to life the attention to detail is incredible - down to pink @entity15 - style signs or flowerbeds and hedges dotted with purple toadstools entertainers dressed as @entity170 and the @entity89 were on hand to amuse the pint - sized partygoers famous friends : party planner @entity10 poses with @entity174 ( left ) and his a-list client , @entity6 ( right ) a-list favourite : @entity49 ( far right ) has planned parties for @entity7 and has also worked with @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity6 @entity49 , who numbers @entity7 , @entity6 and @entity179 among his clients , pictured hard at work on his laptop			1
