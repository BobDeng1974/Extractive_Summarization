@entity0 needs chemotherapy to treat the rare and deadly cancer he was born with but has lost his health insurance under an administrative blunder seemingly caused by @entity5			1
while the president 's signature policy promised that no one with a pre-existing condition would not be covered , the @entity5 has seemingly caused the seven - year - old @entity10 , @entity11 , boy to face an agonizing wait for treatment as his parents battle to get him back on his insurance plan			1
' why would you cancel a kid ? ' asked his mother @entity19			2
' i really want to send @entity21 and all of them pictures of my son			0
he has scars all over his head			0
he does n’t want to leave the house because he ’s afraid people are going to make fun of him because he ’s bald			0
' desperate : @entity0 needs treatment for his rare cancer but has been left uninsured after a administrative glitch caused by the introduction of @entity5 tragic : while the president 's signature policy promised that no one with pre-existing condition would not be covered , the @entity5 has seemingly caused the seven - year - old @entity38 , @entity11 , boy to lose his insurnance while mom @entity19 and dad @entity44 go out their minds with worry , @entity0 - who was born with an extremely rare form of cancer called @entity43 - is battling the disease which has now spread to his brain			1
but after seven years of fighting his illness , @entity0 's insurance has been canceled and he is due his next round of chemo , which costs $ 50,000 and right now , @entity19 says he is unlikely to get it			1
the @entity0 's are battling with children 's medicaid , or @entity57 - which insures @entity0 and despite the family receiving a new , renewed insurance card , they were informed that their agency had dropped them			1
' i called them and they said we were dropped october 31st , ' @entity19 said to @entity65			2
she was told that her sons information was lost when administrative changes were made under the @entity5			1
' the lady 's like , the only way we can expedite is if your son was pregnant and in labor , or if he was an illegal , ' @entity19 said			2
the parents said @entity0 ' has known nothing other than hospitals , doctors , sickness and pain			2
' distraught : mother @entity19 has been left out of her mind with worry by the loss of @entity0 's insurance and the bureaucratic minefield she is having to through to fix it @entity19 was incredulous when she received a letter in november from her insurance provider asking why her son - who has been covered by them his entire life - was in hospital in the first place			1
@entity19 reasoned that after seven - years of paying for his medical bills , the insurance company would have a good idea of what was wrong with him			1
despite @entity19 's insistence that the @entity5 has caused her son to be un-insured , a media spokesperson with @entity101 - who handle @entity57 - said that the problem does not lie with @entity5			1
however she did admit to administrative changes that could have led to mistakes moving @entity0 from @entity57 to an upgraded version of @entity108			2
she repeated that the problem was not related to @entity5 , but there were some ' glitches ' in coverage when the changeover happened			2
@entity115 with his daughter @entity116 and son @entity0 - he is a police officer in @entity38 and struggling to get his children the health care they have been insured for their entire lives however , it seems that one of those glitches caused a little boy with life - threatening cancer to lose his health insurance			1
over the past month @entity19 has been stuck in a bureaucratic hell - being passed from one agency telephone helpline to the next			2
each one has brought her no closer to an answer or a resolution			0
@entity19 said she ’d had @entity0 's current insurance for a year - and - a - half and had never received any notice that she needed to ' requalify ' her children because of @entity5			1
when she phoned to complain @entity19 says , ' all of a sudden could not find my son case , at all			0
and then , she transferred me over to another gentleman who found his case			0
he said it was hidden , because when they switched over to @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , they lost a lot of cases files and @entity0 ’s was just one of those			1
' the more she asked , the more confusing the answers became			0
' then they told me october 17th was when he was actually canceled			0
but on october 25 he had chemo , and they paid for it			0
so , i am getting different stories			0
' tough : @entity0 has been ill his entire life and needs another round of chemotherapy to battle his rare form of cancer the latest development in the shocking case is one that the wife of a small town police officer finds hard to believe			1
' now , the new story with @entity57 is they called and said my husband makes too much money , $ 173 too much			0
' so , i ’m very upset			0
i was bawling on the phone with her and the only thing she said was , ‘ have a nice day , ’ and she hung up			0
' to make matters worse , the @entity0 's have been told that their son 's cancer is not only rare but behaving in an unusual manner			1
' these tumors are very rare			0
they are not supposed to spread , but his decided they were going to spread			0
and it can go into his lungs , because the tumors like soft tissue , and your lungs are soft tissue			0
' with @entity0 desperately in need of a new round of @entity191 , @entity19 has said the family have no choice but to accept the massive $ 50,000 bill for it with no insurance			1
however , they have set up a fund for people to help - ' heroes for @entity0 ' and so far they have raised $ 11,005 - but everything will help .			2

a @entity10 , @entity11 family is fighting for their cancer - *stricken* child 's life after he was removed from his insurance plan
@entity44 and @entity19 ’s seven - year - old boy @entity0 is in need of another round of chemotherapy costing $ 50,000
