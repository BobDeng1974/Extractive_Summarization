a mentally ill grandfather died after police officers strapped him naked to a chair , smothered him with a ' spit hood ' and pepper - sprayed him 10 times during a 43 - hour ordeal , it has been claimed			1
@entity8 , 62 , was allegedly tortured in the ' @entity10 's chair ' at @entity12 jail after being detained by @entity14 police officers in march 2009 following a ' mental breakdown '			1
the hood , designed to stop him from spitting at officers , meant he could not escape the noxious spray 's fumes - and he was never allowed to clean the residue from his body			1
his family is now suing @entity24 for ' wrongful death '			1
it is not clear who exactly took the shocking photograph , which was later handed to @entity48 13 's news team , of @entity49 strapped into the chair with a hood over his face			2
the retired boilermaker , from @entity55 , had suffered from heart disease and emphysema , put down to his years as a smoker and of continual exposure to asbestos			0
he was being treated for depression when he decided to take some time out and visit his brother in @entity64			1
prior to the trip , his doctor moved away , leaving no - one to manage his emotional state or possible side effects of his drugs			1
his wife @entity70 was so worried about his trip that she contacted @entity12 police to ask them to keep an eye out for him			1
she also asked a captain from the @entity76 , @entity55 , police to urge his @entity14 counterparts to take him to hospital if they found him			1
@entity49 was first arrested on march 25 for being drunk in a public place			2
this has subsequently been contested as he may merely have been in a severely confused state			0
he was released after telling jail attendants of his various medical conditions			0
two days later , on march 27 , he was arrested for trespassing at the hotel where he was staying			2
shocking : @entity8 , pictured in the restraining chair at @entity12 jail moved : @entity8 was eventually taken to hospital , after 43 - hours of what has been claimed was ' torture ' at the hands of deputies @entity94 , whose @entity96 firm @entity95 & @entity97 has filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of his estate , said it was a ' minor ' offence			1
he said : ' he was having another mental episode			2
he was bewildered , acting crazy , and so the hotel got fed up and asked him to leave			0
when he did n't go , they called the police			2
' worried : @entity49 said she had been concerned about her husband 's trip to @entity14 @entity94 said jail staff did not screen @entity49 's mental health before he was jailed , even though they had the list of his conditions from his first arrest , and locked his medications in a truck			1
he was never given any drugs during his 43 hours in custody , he also claimed			0
the trouble started when @entity49 , who was uncooperative from the time of his arrest , became angry			0
deputies responded by directly spraying him or fogging his cell with pepper spray at least 10 times			0
he was never allowed to wash the spray off			0
other inmates in the jail told @entity128 that the blasts were so strong the secondary effects caused them to gag			0
@entity49 was then placed into a restraining chair to bind inmates at both wrists , both ankles , and across the chest			0
inmates , along with a deputy trainee named @entity138 , have already testified that @entity49 was sprayed at least two more times after he had been strapped to the chair			0
he was also stripped naked , and outfitted with a spit mask , a hood designed to prevent inmates from spitting on jail personnel			0
but the mask kept the pepper spray close to his nose and mouth , meaning he kept inhaling it for six hours			0
@entity49 , whose wife @entity70 flew to @entity14 on hearing of his arrest , is said to have pleaded with officers by saying the mask made it difficult for him to breathe			1
@entity94 added : ' she was actually relieved to hear he had been arrested she thought they had responded to her pleas for help , that they would take him to a hospital to be treated			0
' unaccounted for : no one at @entity24 has ever been charged over the horrific incident mrs @entity49 was not allowed to see her husband who , on march 29 , went into respiratory distress and was taken to the @entity167 in @entity64			1
it was there that doctors had to repeatedly change their gloves because of the amount of pepper spray on his body , hospital staff said			0
@entity49 suffered multiple heart attacks over the next two days before being declared brain dead and his life support switched off on march 31			2
deputy medical examiner dr @entity179 later noted in his autopsy report that , two days after his death , brown - orange liquid pepper spray was still all over @entity49 's body			1
@entity179 ruled the death a homicide , as @entity49 's heart gave out due to stress from his exposure to pepper spray			2
an internal investigation concluded there no wrongdoing on the part of any @entity12 deputy			0
none of the deputies involved were disciplined in any way and @entity14 state attorney @entity198 declined to press criminal charges			1
