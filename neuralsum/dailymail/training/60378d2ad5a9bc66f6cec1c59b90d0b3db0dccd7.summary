@entity1 , 44 , was left permanently scarred in the unprovoked attack by 20 - year - old @entity3			1
@entity3 , who has a string of previous convictions , initially pleaded guilty to wounding with intent after she slammed a brick into mrs @entity1 's face			1

mrs @entity1 was attacked while she was walking with her daughter @entity22 , 28 , in woodland near @entity24 in @entity25 , in march last year			1
@entity3 , of @entity26 , @entity20 , ‘ slammed ’ a brick into mrs @entity1 ’s face , breaking her nose and wrist , and splitting her lip leaving her with a permanent scar			1
but as she had already been in custody for around 15 months - longer than the statutory prison sentence for the assault - she was released following a hearing at @entity36			2
speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity1 said the ordeal had been made worse by having to wait 18 months for her attacker to be sentenced			1
she said : ' it feels like you get attacked twice - once by her , and once by the judicial system			2
' she has walked away from court but i will never be able to walk away from what happened			2
i do n’t feel safe knowing she ’s out there and i do n’t think anyone else should			0
' reliving the attack , mrs @entity1 said : ' we ran up a hill and saw that a large bush had been set on fire , and there was a girl and a boy just looking at it			1

we managed to stamp it out and we called the fire brigade to let them know			0
' there were matches on the floor so i picked them up			0
she started shouting at me to give them back			0
she followed us and at first we just ignored her			0
' she picked up a brick and i told her not to be ridiculous and to put it down			0

' i turned away and i heard her coming at me again			0
as i turned back she hit me full in the face and knocked me off my feet			0
' @entity3 was arrested after mrs @entity1 and her husband later spotted her at a bus stop and called the police			1
scarred and scared : the mother ( pictured left ) suffered permanent nerve damage to her face , and has had a number of operations since the attack			2
right , her attacker @entity3 walks free from court			2
@entity3 , who has convictions for harassment and criminal damage , had been released after attacking mrs @entity1 , but was taken into custody for breach of bail conditions			1
just weeks after the attack she carried out a campaign of harassment against a pensioner that included sending 13 takeaways to his home in one night			0
mrs @entity1 , 44 , who is fundraising manager at @entity97 in @entity98 , also suffered permanent nerve damage to her face , and has had a number of operations			1
judge @entity101 said it was clear @entity3 ’ autism was the ‘ driving force ’ behind the offence			0
he said : ' i must ensure as far as i can that no one else is subjected by you to the type of offence that mrs @entity1 has suffered			1
' this attack has had both a physical and psychological impact on mrs @entity1 , and i suspect that she will live with the memory of what happened for the rest of her life			1
' he ordered that @entity3 be made the subject of a three - year community order			0
the judge also ordered probation to provide him with regular reports on @entity3 ’ progress , and imposed an order preventing her from contacting mrs @entity1 or her daughter			2
