by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 07:14 est , 21 may 2013 battle - hardened villagers who maintained a round - the - clock blockade for 1,088 consecutive days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp now have to find £ 20,000 after the travellers won the right for a costly public inquiry			1
residents maintained a three - year vigil at the site in picturesque @entity12 , @entity13 , after it was occupied in may 2010			1
just a month ago they were celebrating and many members broke down in tears as the caravans left the land			1
but a fresh appeal means locals will be forced to endure a five - day inquiry as the travellers demand the right to put two caravans back on the eight - acre greenbelt site			1
row : @entity25 , who owns the contentious gypsy site in @entity12 , has won the right for a five - day public inquiry as the travellers have nowhere to go exit : on the eve of leaving the site last month a caravan was set alight as members of the gypsy community moved from the land the last camp : @entity12 resident @entity36 starts to dismantle the protest tent after the last travellers finally left the site in the @entity13 village in april - but they may have to return the dedicated 200 locals - known as @entity42 ( @entity42 ) - kept a constant presence at the site to prevent further development of the land			1
the infamous ' @entity47 ' finally lost their epic three - year legal battle to stay at the site after exhausting their last hope when a high court judge threw out an application for them to remain on the site in march			1
they finally abandoned the ruined site on april 21 this year - after burning a caravan and setting fires across the field			2
now landowner @entity25 claims the gypsies have been left ' scattered across the land ' with nowhere to go			2
he has appealed the @entity61 ruling sparking a public inquiry which will be held in august			1
crew : these battle - hardened villagers , who fought for 1,088 days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp , now to have to stump up £ 20,000 for a costly public inquiry @entity70 land : an aerial shot of the village and the nearby field , which was turned into an illegal camp site , shows the damage done by the travellers in recovery : the travellers who lived on the site have been given one month to restore the land to its former green glory damage : the field , which has been occupied by travellers since april 2010 , was left torn up by vehicles @entity84 , vice chair of @entity42 , called the inquiry a ' waste of public money ' and said it would cost the group around £ 20,000 out of their own pockets to fight			1
mr @entity84 said : ' this planning inquiry is a waste of public money			2
in total , it will cost around £ 20,000 to hire a barrister and planning consultants			2
' we are determined that this is the wrong place for any type of development with highway dangers , flooding , accessibility , and sustainability issues , which mirrors all the reasons for the adjacent site being inappropriate as confirmed by the local authority and courts			0
' they say they need these two pitches because they have nowhere to go but they are living somewhere right now			0
' this is the nature of what we are dealing with			0
unfortunately what happens is that the developer , @entity25 , is trying to wear down the system with repeated planning applications			0
' it 's the thin end of the wedge because if they get planning permission , they will try to extend it			0
' defiant : a traveller fuels a fire at the site in @entity12 before they left time to leave : a caravan is towed from the site at the end of a 1,088 day year battle in the courts but @entity25 called the protests ' pointless ' and issued a chilling warning to villagers when he said there would be ' no end ' to their battle for the land			2
mr @entity25 , 48 , said : ' there is no " final " appeal in this process , we will keep going till the very end			0
' we 'll try again in october , and probably wait until the next government and try again			0
' if i could sell the land i would , but i have already tried and there are no takers , so i have nothing else to do with it , and no money to do anything with it			0
goodbye ? locals had hoped to see the end of the camp but a new legal challenge may change that celebrations : @entity42 members @entity162 and @entity164 give the camera the victory sign last month - but the battle over the land started again today applause : the protest has been ongoing since the group of travellers first moved to the greenbelt land in the village in april 2010 final caravan : spokesman and leader of ' raid ' , @entity175 celebrates the groups initial victory against the travellers by holding a ' not out ' sign up as the protest site 's caravan is moved away @entity182 : ' raid ' leader @entity175 , centre , speaks ahead of the moment of silence in honour of their fallen protesters who did not see the day of victory last month ' all we want is for two caravans for elderly people , and space for someone to look after them			1
' all this has resulted in is children being forced out of schools , and people scattered around the countryside on the side of roads			0
' we just want to use the land , on hard standing , until the council find us somewhere to go			0
' a @entity208 spokesman said : ' @entity208 can confirm that a public inquiry will open on august 8 , 2013 , further details regarding the venue and start times will be published within the next few weeks			1

protesters finally got illegal camp in @entity13 broken up a month ago
but the landowner appealed because the travellers have nowhere to go
