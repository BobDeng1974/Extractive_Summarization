@entity0 , 40 , thought it ' entirely acceptable ' for a black worker to be given the nickname ' golliwog @entity4 ' at her multi-million pound firm , a tribunal ruled the owner of a multi-million pound firm failed to stop her staff calling another employee ' golliwog @entity4 ' because she did not think there was anything wrong with the nickname			1
@entity0 , 40 , ' tolerated a culture of racism ' at her fruit and vegetable wholesaler , an employment tribunal found			1
@entity20 was given the nickname and also called ' black @entity4 ' to distinguish him from a white worker with the same first name , the wholesaler admitted			2
another black worker , a delivery driver who was so upset by the racist behaviour that he quit , has been awarded £ 27,000 in compensation after a panel ruled that having to listen to racist nicknames had ' violated his dignity '			1
@entity29 told @entity30 that a colleague ordered him to ' stop speaking that jungle talk ' as he chatted to another driver in patois			2
and bosses at the firm did not discipline a white driver who said that ' black people should be burnt at the stake like @entity40 ' , despite a complaint from an employee with @entity40 heritage			1
the tribunal awarded mr @entity29 £ 13,427 in 2011 for racial harassment and recently ruled he should receive a further £ 14,286 for lost earnings from constructive dismissal			1
ms @entity0 was ' entirely unreceptive ' to the idea that the name - calling might offend black staff , it ruled			1
but mr @entity29 is unlikely to see a penny of his award because the firm has recently gone into administration			1
during the tribunal , the company falsely suggested that mr @entity29 had once been to prison			2
mr @entity29 , who represented himself , was so upset by the lie that he stormed out of the tribunal			0
speaking after the case , ms @entity0 branded the judgment ' absolutely ridiculous '			1
she said : ' @entity20 did not have any issues			0
he is not shy and if he had wanted to bring up the names with me , he would have done			0
he could hold his own			0
' the tribunal was the most pathetic process i have ever come across in my life			0
' mr @entity29 joined the @entity72 - based firm run by divorcee ms @entity0 and her partner @entity73 , 44 , in september 2007			1
it had nearly 30 employees and an annual turnover as high as £ 4.2 million			2
the drivers earned about £ 300 per week and swearing was common in the warehouse , the tribunal heard			2
the company did have an equal opportunities policy but this was kept in a filing cabinet and none of the employees or managers knew it existed			0
in november 2008 , mr @entity29 brought a book on health and safety into work			0
driver @entity29 successfully sued @entity92 of @entity72 for racial discrimination and constructive dismissal but is unlikely to see a penny of his £ 27,000 compensation because the firm has gone into administration the tribunal found : ' ms @entity0 lost her temper with the claimant			1
when he gave it to her , she threw it back at him			0
ms @entity0 also pushed the claimant out of her office			1
' mr @entity29 quit that day , citing harassment and discriminatory practices in his resignation letter			0
the panel concluded : ' the claimant worked for an employer that tolerated not only racial banter in the workplace but also the expression of extreme forms of racial prejudice			0
' the claimant found this comment to be offensive and was concerned that no steps appeared to be taken to address it			0
' this was known about by ms @entity0			1
it did not occur to her to take any steps to curb this practice as it did not occur to her that there could be anything wrong with it			0
' ms @entity0 was entirely unreceptive to the notion that calling someone by the colour of their skin could cause offence			1
' she had given no thought to finding another way of distinguishing the two @entity136 that did not involve labelling one of them by the colour of their skin			0
' she had had no training in the principles of equal opportunity and appeared to have an entirely closed mind to what those principles might entail			0
' at the very least we would have expected ms @entity0 to have taken some steps to ensure this was not causing offence to mr @entity20			2
' ms @entity0 was an employer who thought it entirely acceptable to distinguish one employee from another by referring to the colour of the skin of the black employee			1
' that ms @entity155 had no index of concern about this practice satisfied us further that there was a culture of racism that was tolerated in the workplace			2

@entity0 did nothing to *prevent* a culture of racism at @entity72 firm
one employee wins £ 27,000 for discrimination and constructive dismissal
but he is unlikely to see cash as @entity92 is in administration
