as a boyhood @entity2 fan and a huge admirer of the @entity5 , @entity0 could soon face a dilemma if interest in the left - back solidifies into concrete bids			1
as @entity12 revealed recently , @entity11 chairman @entity10 is bracing himself for a £ 2million offer from @entity14 for the latest gem off the @entity17 production line			1
and on sunday , @entity2 joined the long list of clubs watching the gifted teenager when @entity22 ’s assistant @entity21 scouted @entity0 during @entity11 ’ 1 - 0 win at @entity24			1
@entity0 has been linked with a number of @entity5 clubs as well as @entity2 if the 19 - year old would find it difficult choosing between potential suitors in the east end of @entity31 and @entity32 , however , he is more clear - cut on other issues			1
he has no doubt in his mind that he is old enough to make the next big step in his career , provided the right bid is received by the @entity17 club			0
‘ i ’m 20 next week , ’ said @entity0 , who has helped @entity11 into third in the @entity41 but is out of contract at the end of the season			1
‘ i do n’t think that ’s too young or too old to move from @entity11			1
‘ i ’m a @entity2 fan and obviously the ( @entity46 ) @entity5 is one of the best leagues in the world			1
@entity0 has made more than 100 appearances for the @entity11 first team ‘ that ’s my dream - you want to reach as high a level as you can and if i can get to the @entity5 that would be brilliant			1
‘ but the @entity11 would need to see if it ’s the right offer			1
if it is , they say they ’ll never stand in anybody ’s way			2
they are a great club like that			0
if they accepted it , there is not much i could do			0
‘ it ’s good massive clubs are getting mentioned			0
but i just want to get my head down and keep doing well			0
‘ just now , the @entity11 are flying and i ’m loving every minute of it			1
we just want to finish as high as we can			0
’ with over 100 first - team appearances for @entity11 before the age of 20 , @entity0 is following a similar path tread by @entity70 and @entity71			1
both gained experience at @entity11 before finding fame and fortune down south as @entity77 winners with @entity78 before moving to @entity79 and @entity80 , respectively			1
the 19 - year - old believes he is ready to make a move to a bigger club accies manager @entity84 has long stated nothing would please him more than to see the next generation of gems in @entity88 win a life - changing big - money move			1
but he has warned @entity0 and @entity41 leading scorer @entity90 that if they get distracted by transfer speculation this month they risk their starting places			2
‘ the boys all know that , if they continue to do well here , if something does crop up , we wo n’t stand in their way , ’ said @entity84			2
‘ but if they take their eye off the ball and think they will get their move without anything happening then they could find themselves out the team and that move will quickly disappear			0
‘ but they are all completely focused			0
not one of them has mentioned a single thing about transfers			0
@entity11 manager @entity84 says the club wo n't stand in @entity0 's way if the right offer came in ‘ we ’ve had no contact at all so far for any of our players			1
‘ it ’s still early days in january but most clubs , unless they are prepared to pay top dollar , will wait and try and get their targets on the cheap			0
‘ we do n’t want to sell anyone but at the same time we are a selling club			0
and this club is good at making sure it gets the maximum for anybody moving on			0
‘ if we receive a deal which is right for the player and the club , we wo n’t stand in their way			2
but no one will be leaving here on the cheap			0
’ should @entity11 swell their coffers this month , their tried - and - trusted youth development - focused business model will remain			1
but the @entity11 boss said that the club have not received any contact regarding any of their players while being third in the league is a source of pride for @entity84 , so too is the accies under - 20s being three clear of @entity146 at the top of the @entity148			1
‘ any money which comes will go back into the youth academy , ’ continued the manager			2
‘ i might potentially get some money to sign somebody but it will be a free transfer			0
we wo n’t spend any money buying someone			2
‘ we are very well run , and when someone else goes , we will generally replace them with one of our younger players			0
‘ i ’ve got a few in the under - 20s who are itching to go			2
they are top of their youth league and some are ready to go in the first - team right now			2
we will give them their chance			0
