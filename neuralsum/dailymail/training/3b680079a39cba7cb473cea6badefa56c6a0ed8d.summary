by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 04:49 est , 15 january 2014 despite costing upwards of Â£ 4,000 , almost 5,000 people opt for a facelift every year			0
but splashing out thousands of pounds does n't always guarantee a good result			0
indeed , as 57 - year - old retired nurse , @entity8 , from @entity7 discovered , it does n't always mean that anything has been done at all			1
shockingly , @entity8 , who had a face and neck lift in 2011 , was left with more wrinkles than when she began thanks to a rogue surgeon who failed to complete the procedure			1
devastated : @entity8 was distraught when her facelift was botched so badly , her face collapsed instead , as she later discovered , he had used liposuction to produce a smooth result but had managed to inflict catastrophic damage to her facial muscles at the same time			1
as a result , less than a year after she had the treatment , @entity8 's face collapsed , leaving her with sagging skin and wrinkles ' more suited to a woman in her 70s '			1
@entity8 , who says she has barely left the house in three years because of the disaster , says : ' there 's no other way to describe it , really , other than a nightmare			1
i just do n't want this face			0
' i had my eyes done , upper and lower , face and neck , ' she adds			0
but less than a year later ' i seemed to have blinked and [ the facelift ] had gone			0
' the neck had dropped , the chin had dropped and shortly after , the rest of face had gone too			0
' it 's caused me so much stress , anxiety and heartache - you name it , i 've been there this last couple of years or so because of this			2
' change : after being unable to leave home for three years , @entity8 has now had the neck lift she wanted although @entity8 returned to the original doctor and asked him to fix the botched facelift , his efforts only made things worse , as cosmetic surgeon dr @entity60 points out			1
' @entity8 is a classic example of a patient , who 's gone in looking for one type of operation and been given a different one , ' he says			2
speaking during a consultation filmed for @entity68 documentary , @entity67 , he adds : ' i ca n't see that anyone 's touched [ the ] neck so that 's why it was back down within a month			0
' to add insult to injury , @entity8 's first surgeon even tried to convince her that her face was drooping not because of his shoddy work , but because she had n't chosen to have @entity79 as well			1
' when you get a patient like @entity8 , where they 've had surgery but it 's not right , and you tell them it 's not right , the first emotion they have is relief that they 're not mad , ' adds dr @entity60			1
relieved : @entity8 says she feels ' marvellous ' and hopes to be able to live a normal life once more ' but then that turns to anger as they realise they were lied to , as they realise that what they paid for is n't what they 've got			2
' unfortunately for @entity8 , fixing the damage means another operation to lift the neck and plump up the skin with fat taken from another part of the body , and a peel to minimise fine lines			2
' i 'm hoping that it 'll give me back some of the self - confidence that i 've lost over the years , ' adds @entity8			1
six weeks after surgery and @entity8 's muscles are mended and her face well on the way to looking normal again			1
' i 'm just feeling ecstatic			0
i just really ca n't put it into words , ' she enthuses , despite the swathe of bandages still covering her face			0
dr @entity60 is more circumspect			0
' i just hope now she has the confidence to get up , get out , start seeing her friends again and live a normal life , ' he says			0
@entity8 appears in @entity67 , thursday at 8pm on @entity68			2
