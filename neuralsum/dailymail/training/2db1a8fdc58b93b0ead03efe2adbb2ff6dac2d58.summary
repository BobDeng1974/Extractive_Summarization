@entity0 died a week after giving evidence at the trial of her former music teacher a coroner has criticised mental health services for ‘ failing ’ to provide proper care to a concert violinist who died just a week after giving evidence against her predatory former choirmaster			1
coroner @entity11 also demanded that new rules are put in place to ensure that vulnerable witnesses are given better support when they face often traumatic trials			1
mother - of - four @entity0 was ‘ extremely traumatised ’ after testifying about abuse she suffered as a teenager at the hands of @entity21 ’s @entity23 choirmaster @entity22 and his wife @entity24			1
she took a fatal overdose at her home in @entity27 , @entity28 , days later on january 24 , 2013			0
she did not live to see her abuser jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault two months later			1
delivering his verdict at @entity33 , mr @entity11 said he could not be sure she intended to kill herself and ruled out a verdict of suicide			0
@entity22 preyed on the young violin virtuoso at the prestigious school in @entity38 , forcing her to perform sex acts on him in his office and camper van			1
his ex-wife later joined in the abuse and was jailed for 21 months for one count of indecent assault			1
mrs @entity0 had confided in her husband @entity47 , 59 , but chose not to tell police			1
in 2011 she told a friend , who later contacted officers			0
as police investigated the case , she became increasingly down , withdrawn and depressed and repeatedly took overdoses , the inquest heard			0
but despite this , failures among health professionals meant she was accidentally ‘ amber - zoned ’ in records kept by a mental health team , whereas she had been assessed as the top ‘ red ’ priority			1
as 2012 drew to a close and the date of her abuser 's trial got nearer , her mental health deteriorated and she ‘ changed significantly ’			1
‘ her reason to overdose was not to kill herself but was a way to cope with the court case			0
’ but the coroner hit out at the support received by the talented musician			2
he said health professionals repeatedly failed to appreciate the risk she posed to herself			2
he said : ‘ i ca n't help but think there was a real failure to appreciate the urgency of the situation and a failure to act upon it in an appropriate manner			0
‘ what is clear is she found giving evidence extremely traumatic			2
’ she had to endure a tense cross-examination by defence lawyers during her abuser 's court case in january last year			0
and during the trial , on january 23 , the judge in @entity22 's case ordered the jury to deliver a number of not - guilty verdicts because of principles of law			2
her husband @entity104 ( pictured ) said he hoped his wife 's death would ensure that other victims do not have to go through the same ordeal at 8am the next day mr @entity104 found his wife , known as @entity110 , dead at their home			2
he earlier told the inquest she had sunk into ‘ incredible despair ’ and ‘ felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally ’			0
the coroner said a failure to explain to the mrs @entity0 why the not - guilty verdicts had been ordered was wrong			1
he said : ‘ such matters , if left unexplained , could have a devastating effect on a complainant , who might well take it to be a reflection of the evidence that they have given			0
’ mr @entity11 said failures in mrs @entity0 's medical care at the end of 2012 meant she was not allocated a care co-ordinator quickly enough , and when she eventually was he was off sick			2
he also said there were serious shortcomings in communication between her mental health worker and gp			1
he said the lack of urgency surrounding her care was ‘ quite extraordinary ’			0
‘ there was a real failure to provide @entity110 with the care that some two months before it was recognised that she needed , ’ he said			0
the coroner said he would write to the @entity145 ( @entity146 ) to call for alleged victims in trials to be given an explanation when jurors are ordered to give not - guilty verdicts			2
he also wants the @entity146 to ensure that advice about the psychiatric counselling available to vulnerable victims is clarified			0
and he will write a third report to @entity28 and @entity156 , calling for greater safeguards to ensure that prescribed medication belonging to family members of people who have overdosed on it is better protected			0
speaking after the inquest , mr @entity104 said he hoped his wife 's tragic death would ensure that other victims do not have to go through the same ordeal she did			2
he said : ‘ i think that all the services involved really looked at what went wrong and they have all tightened up their measures			2
and hopefully for the next lot of victims something will have changed for the better			0
’ asked if he wished his wife had never had to go to court , he said : ‘ i ca n't say that because , for one reason , she needed to for her own peace of mind			0
’ he said maybe his wife ‘ could have got more care ’ adding : ‘ i think that was shown today in the inquiries of the coroner 's final decision			0
’ the inquest was held at @entity186 ( pictured ) where coroner @entity11 criticised mental health services and demanded that new rules are put in place the verdict follows a damning serious case review by @entity192 in april which found mrs @entity0 's death ‘ could and should ’ have been prevented			1
it concluded she was let down by mental health services who failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids and faced her abuser in court			1
@entity22 , who went on to direct the @entity200 , was stripped of his obe for services to music after being jailed for the assaults when mrs @entity0 was aged just 14 and 15			1
@entity205 , assistant chief executive at @entity206 , called for an urgent inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues			1
he said : ' it is appalling that @entity0 did not get the help she needed to cope with the trauma of the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager			1
' it 's critical that vulnerable victims and witnesses get the right support and information about the progress of their cases			0
without this we fear more cases will end in tragedy			0
' we believe there is an urgent need for an inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues , matching recent efforts to help the people who commit those crimes who have mental health needs			1
