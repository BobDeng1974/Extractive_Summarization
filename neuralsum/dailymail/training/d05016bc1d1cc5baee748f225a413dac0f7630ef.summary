@entity4 has made no secret of the fact he felt @entity2 was totally in the wrong for their first - corner shunt in last sunday 's @entity12 @entity11 that resulted in him being flipped upside down in his @entity13			1
the @entity14 accused the @entity16 rookie of being ' too aggressive ' and taking the wrong line , whilst chastising young drivers in general for causing too many accidents			2
snubbed : @entity4 was hoping to hold clear the air talks with @entity2 @entity21 : but @entity2 felt thaat there was no need to do so that is despite the fact it was @entity4 who had to answer to the stewards for ' causing a collision ' , with the 33 - year - old cleared			1
not even a few days of reflection , though , altered @entity4 's view as he reiterated his remarks of a few days ago on thursday ahead of this weekend 's @entity33			1
@entity4 did at least state he would be more than happy to chat over the situation with @entity2 , although the 21 - year - old @entity36 is far from keen			2
asked whether it was worth talking to @entity4 , @entity2 replied : ' no , it 's done			1
we are here in @entity41 and not in @entity12 any more			2
' it happened and it 's good no - one got hurt , especially him because he was on his roof and it looked bad			0
the most important thing is he 's all right			0
' whoever was at fault is not really something i get in to			0
it 's up to the stewards to judge and he was reported to the stewards , i was n't			0
' from their view i did n't do anything wrong			0
' shocker : @entity4 's world was turned upside down at @entity62 on sunday crash : @entity4 ( left ) collides with @entity64 driver @entity2 on the first corner @entity4 claimed @entity2 should have backed out of his move down the inside into turn one , but the latter insists he did not do anything wrong , and if given the same opportunity would take it			1
' what i did was get a great launch , got on the inside of @entity75 ( @entity4 's team - mate ) , but not quite enough to have him in the corner , ' added @entity2			1
' obviously i had to back out of that and then it ( the accident ) happened			0
i 'm not sure i would have done anything different			0
' you learn from these things and if it 's your fault or not it 's still experience and something you remember			0
