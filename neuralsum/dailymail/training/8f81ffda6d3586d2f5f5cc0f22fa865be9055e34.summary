by @entity0 published : 15:16 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 15:47 est , 2 may 2013 the trail of photos left online by the friends of the @entity5 bomber shows that they went on a trip from @entity7 to @entity8 in recent months			1
there is an eerie shadow over the photos as it was revealed that suspect @entity12 and his now - dead brother @entity13 were plotting to continue their terror streak in @entity16 after killing three and injuring more than 200 in the marathon bombing			2
@entity18 and @entity19 , both @entity21 nationals , and an @entity23 friend @entity22 were all arrest on wednesday for various charges relating to helping their friend ' @entity26 ' cover up his tracks after the bombing			1
blocks away : @entity19 posted this picture of himself in front of the @entity33 headquarters , just blocks from @entity34 , on his profile for a @entity37 social media site seeing the sights : @entity19 is seen posing in front of the @entity40 with two unidentified friends during the same trip to @entity8 boys trip : @entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 ( center ) pose with suspected bomber @entity12 ( right ) in the middle of @entity34 in @entity16 during a trip thought to have taken place in april 2012 @entity18 , 19 , and @entity19 , 20 , have profiles on @entity37 social media site @entity49 that show pictures of themselves touring @entity16 , though it does not appear that @entity22 was on the trip			1
at one point during the trip , which appears to have taken place in april 2012 , the group stopped to take the typical tourist shot in front of the @entity40			0
another stop on their tour was @entity34 , where five young men - including @entity12 , @entity18 and @entity19 - posed happily			1
different view : because the charges against the friends , including @entity19 on the left , focus on their involvement after the bombings , it does not imply that they had any prior knowledge about the attack - or the @entity12 's plot to drive down to @entity16 on the same day and continue their attack no red flags : @entity76 's social media profile does not seem unlike that of many other college - age boys @entity19 also had his picture taken outside of the office of the @entity33 , just blocks away from @entity34			1
the bustling @entity8 tourist attraction clearly stuck with @entity12 , as he and his brother reportedly considered it as a second bombing location			2
following @entity13 's death during an altercation with police and @entity91 's arrest , the @entity86 reported that the pair initially planned on driving the @entity93 that they hijacked and driving it to @entity8 from @entity96 but were thwarted by a lack of gas			1
enjoying life : @entity19 posted pictures of himself smoking a hookah pipe ( left ) and relaxing pals : @entity18 ( center ) and @entity19 ( right ) lived together in an apartment off of the @entity106 campus in @entity107 , though it is unclear where this picture was taken connection : @entity12 is seen here with @entity18 , and the two reportedly joked about him being the @entity5 bomber via text in the days after the attack joking : @entity18 , seen with two different friends , told investigators that he thought @entity12 was playing around when he sent texts brushing off similarities between himself and the suspected bomber ' questioning of @entity12 revealed that he and his brother decided spontaneously on @entity34 as a target , ' @entity8 police commissioner @entity121 said a news conference with @entity8 mayor @entity126			1
' they would drive to @entity34 that same night			0
that plan , however , fell apart when they realized that the vehicle that they hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station			0
' apparently the city left an impression on @entity19 as well , as he highlights their group trip			0
in addition to pictures from their trip , @entity19 posts about songs that he likes - including @entity145 's ' @entity144 ' and more recently @entity146 and @entity147 ' ' can not hold us ' , which he added on april 18 , just days after the bombing			2
waiting : @entity18 ( pictured ) is now being held without bail until the may 14 hearing , along with his friends @entity19 and @entity22 @entity154 : @entity18 's affinity for nice cars prompted the investigation as he was first questioned by police about his ' humorous ' vanity license plates that read ' @entity160 ' red flag : police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates ( pictured ) but then held them on immigration charges since they are @entity21 nationals in the country on expired academic visas on his profile , fellow arrestee @entity18 posted the @entity34 group shot , along with another undated picture of himself with @entity12 and other friends			1
@entity18 also features pictures of himself on a sunny beach , goofing around with a friend while climing in a tree , and posing in a luxury car			0
@entity18 's affinity for flashy cars is what got them into trouble in the first place with police , as they were initially questioned when it was revealed that the @entity93 that had a vanity license plate that read ' @entity189 # 1 '			2
his lawyer argued that the plate was a gag gift , police became suspicious and then held both he and @entity19 in custody because of immigration issues , as their student visas had expired			0
on wednesday , they both were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence			0
the criminal complaint lists that they removed @entity12 's backpack from his room and ' agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that @entity12 was one of the @entity5 bombers			1
' girlfriend : though a girl who had a brief romantic relationship with @entity12 has come forward , the girl in this picture seen being kissed by @entity18 has not been identified mystery woman : the girl seen with @entity19 in this picture has not been identified either the three friends - @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity22 - went over to @entity12 's on - campus dormitory after seeing the news reports			1
when the group arrived at the dorm , @entity18 showed @entity19 a text from the bomber that said ' i 'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it			2
' he did not specify where he was going , but @entity19 told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see @entity12 alive again			0
they were let in the room by @entity231 's roommate , who said that @entity12 had been there just a few hours earlier			0
the criminal complaint says that when there , the three friends watched a movie			0
@entity18 ' knew ' that @entity12 was involved in the fatal attack when he saw the empty fireworks in the dorm room .			0
