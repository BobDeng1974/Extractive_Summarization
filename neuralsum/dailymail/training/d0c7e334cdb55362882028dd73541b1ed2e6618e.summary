one of the region 's most active volcanoes , its latest eruption has forced regional flight cancellations and dusted some nearby communities with ash			1
@entity1 released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft ( 6,700m ) over the weekend , with the cloud blowing eastward and the eruption showing no signs of abating , according to the @entity20			1
the lava from its 8,261ft ( 2,518m ) peak has also created huge steam clouds on meeting the mountain 's snow			0
belching ash and spewing lava , @entity1 in @entity2 has been erupting since may 13 - and @entity5 today released this remarkable picture of it , taken by crew on board the @entity9 while the ash plume was still too low on monday to affect commercial airliners flying at least 30,000ft above sea level between @entity33 and @entity34 , it still interfered with schedules for regional carriers serving rural fishing towns and native villages that lack outside road access			1
@entity40 , an @entity41 - based company specialising in travel in southwestern @entity2 , briefly stopped flights to four destinations to wait for ash to dissipate , said @entity45 , the carrier 's chief executive			2
' we 've had about a dozen cancellations due to the volcano , ' he said			2
@entity40 's planes fly at altitudes between 15,000 and 20,000ft - exactly where they could encounter ash , depending on wind direction , according to @entity45			2
among the cancellations were flights in and out of @entity54 , the top - volume seafood port in the @entity56 , he said			2
@entity1 ( pictured last week ) released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft ( 6,700m ) over the weekend , with the cloud blowing eastward and the eruption showing no signs of abating , according to the @entity20 while the ash plume was still too low on monday to affect commercial airliners flying at least 30,000ft above sea level between @entity33 and @entity34 , it still interfered with schedules for regional carriers serving rural fishing towns and native villages that lack outside road access @entity1 is one of several dozen volcanoes that make up the @entity71			1
the arc stretches across the @entity73 in the south - west of @entity2 to north - eastern @entity74 , 3,000km away			0
it follows the line where the pacific tectonic plate meets the @entity34 plate			0
@entity45 said for those flying in the region , flight disruptions are part of doing business			2
' it 's one of the situations that @entity86 presents itself along our route structure , ' he said			0
@entity89 , also based in @entity41 , cancelled two flights and delayed others , but for the most part , its planes are flying around any ash , said @entity95 , a company official			0
the airline is closely monitoring developments , he said			0
' we 're used to those volcanoes going off in that region , ' he said			0
' but if the winds are wrong , you do n't want to test that pumice			0
' @entity105 plumes could go higher , as @entity1 's eruption could intensify with little warning , the @entity20 said			1
trace amounts of ash fell overnight on @entity110 , a tiny @entity111 village of 50 residents located 48 miles ( 77 km ) northeast of @entity1			1
the volcano had earlier sprinkled ash on @entity114 , a fishing town of about 1,000 people , when the wind was blowing in a slightly different direction , according to the observatory			0
@entity105 plumes could go higher , as @entity1 's eruption could intensify with little warning , the @entity20 said along with potential aviation hazards , the ash poses possible health risks , said @entity122 , a @entity123 geophysicist at the observatory			1
' it 's dangerous for the people downwind of it , because you do n't really want to breathe in that fine ash that long , ' @entity122 said of the eruption taking place on the @entity73 , 590 miles ( 950km ) southwest of @entity41			0
@entity1 is one of @entity2 's most restless volcanoes and had its last major eruption in 2007			1
the @entity20 estimates it has erupted about two dozen times between 1901 and 2007			0
during the 29 - day eruption six years ago , the volcano emitted mud flows and erupting lava , as well as ash clouds up to 18,000ft high			1
