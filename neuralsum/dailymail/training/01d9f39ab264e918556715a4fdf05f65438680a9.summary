@entity1 ’s players are braced for a harsh post-mortem at their @entity3 on monday despite the supreme quality of friday ’s victory over @entity6			1
the magnitude of the result will not ensure immunity from criticism as the national team strive to build on an impressive start to their @entity14 campaign			1
there was an abundance of @entity18 gallantry and class on show at the @entity21 but the quest to raise standards ahead of saturday ’s clash with @entity25 at @entity26 means the review process will highlight every error , however trivial			2
@entity1 centre @entity29 scored the decisive try of the game as they won 16 - 21 against @entity6 @entity29 ( left ) evaded two tackles to breach the @entity6 defence before scoring under the posts head coach @entity37 and his assistants wo n’t attempt to sugar - coat the debrief			1
instead , they want to refocus minds after the 21 - 16 triumph in @entity44			0
any trace of euphoria will be banished , any hint of complacency resisted			0
there will be a concerted effort to adopt the never - satisfied mentality of a champion team , which is what @entity1 are desperate to become			1
@entity55 captain @entity54 delivered a barnstorming performance in @entity44 but even in the aftermath of a famous victory , he said : ‘ come the monday review we will be hard on ourselves			1
the mark of a good side is being tough on yourselves in victory — go away , learn , prepare for a big week and it all starts again next saturday			1
’ asked if he expected to face harsh video analysis on monday , the flanker added : ‘ oh , 100 per cent , 100 per cent			2
if you ’ve got any ambitions to be a world - class side , you have to be really tough on yourselves			2
@entity1 's stars celebrated their win in the dressing room - but they wo n't be dwelling on it for too long @entity29 ( centre ) is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates as they celebrate his second half try against @entity6 ‘ the coaches will do a big presentation then the boys will do one - on - one feedback			1
‘ i ’ll have to go through my game rigorously and i ’m sure there are lots of things i can improve on			2
to get a win like we did is very special , so i think we ’ll allow ourselves a few hours to smile , then the job will start again			2
’ this week ’s challenge for the @entity1 management is to somehow recreate the intensity of their build - up to the @entity6 game			1
facing @entity25 at @entity26 is , in truth , a banker			0
the hosts will be determined to reveal a ruthless streak in the way they set about demonstrating their superiority , no matter how convincing their public utterances about taking nothing for granted			0
one especially heartening aspect of the win over @entity6 was the level of composure and leadership in the visitors ’ ranks			2
captain @entity110 set an authoritative tone in the tunnel before kick - off with his refusal to take to the field when first requested , amid concerns that the opposition would keep his players waiting for too long in the bitter cold			0
@entity121 brothers @entity122 ( left ) and @entity123 are all smiles as @entity1 defy their underdogs tag and beat @entity6 @entity126 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after scoring against @entity6 in the @entity14 his defiant stance sent out the right message			1
his expression of stern conviction spoke volumes about a man who has grown into the role			0
@entity110 was standing up for his players and they responded by fighting their way out of what @entity37 called a ‘ big hole ’ after going 10 - 0 down			0
‘ we were n’t particularly panicked , ’ said @entity54 , referring to that early scoreline and the reaction to it			1
‘ we knew that if we stayed in the mix , looked after the ball and played in the right areas , we ’d challenge @entity6			0
we managed to do that			0
‘ at half - time we came in , re-grouped and knew we were in the game			0
we played sensible rugby , looked after the ball and kept our discipline			0
’ this ability to adapt calmly on the hoof was a sign of increasing @entity18 maturity			0
@entity54 spoke of his aim to make good decisions and that has evidently been a priority across the board			1
there were clear heads under pressure , as illustrated by two astute kicks from @entity162 — one in restricted space to set up @entity126 ’s try and another which found touch deep in @entity6 territory late on to help his team turn the screw			2
@entity54 ( blue scrum cap ) bounced back off the post protector at the @entity21 on friday @entity1 players celebrate at the full - time whistle as they record a memorable victory over @entity6 @entity37 has often referred to the ‘ leadership group ’ in the squad and — despite the loss of several key men to injury — it was very much in evidence on friday			1
it certainly helped that @entity110 could call upon the support of four club captains in the starting xv — @entity54 , @entity184 ( @entity185 ) , @entity186 ( @entity187 ) and @entity121 ( @entity188 )			1
‘ having leaders from clubs in the side can only help to support @entity192 , ’ said @entity54			1
‘ obviously the buck stops with him and he ’s got to have the final say but the “ small talk ” , as we call it , helps the boys to keep their heads on			0
‘ when we look at some of the best sides in the world — especially when we look at @entity203 — they ’ve got a lot of experienced players there who have been through so many situations before			0
‘ we had some boys who had never played a game in @entity44 , so it was important to stay calm and keep making the right decisions			0
the best teams in the world do that			0
’ @entity1 are not in that category just yet but they took a giant stride in the right direction against @entity6 — not that the players will be allowed to savour the feat any longer .			1

@entity1 began their @entity14 campaign with an impressive victory
despite the win , @entity1 are still braced for a harsh post-mortem
@entity54 says @entity1 must be tough on themselves in victory
he believes it is the best way to improve as a team following a win
