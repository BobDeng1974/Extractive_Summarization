by @entity0 a mother has credited her baby daughter with saving her life after doctors discovered a deadly heart condition when she went into hospital to give birth			2
@entity8 , 29 , arrived at hospital for a scheduled caesarean delivery of her third child , @entity11			1
but she struggled to stay conscious in the aftermath of the delivery and emergency tests confirmed she had a seriously weakened heart valve which could have failed at any time			1
@entity8 believes baby @entity11 saved her life because she discovered after the birth that she had a potentially deadly heart condition that needed immediate teratment when she was pregnant with @entity11 , miss @entity8 was very breathless and ill but she was told it was normal she said : ‘ if i had n’t been in hospital at that time , and under those circumstances , then my heart condition might never have been discovered			1
‘ i thank @entity11 for saving my life - if it was n’t for her , i do n’t know if i would be here today			1
’ miss @entity8 , a supermarket worker from @entity27 , discovered she was pregnant with @entity11 in the summer of 2012			1
she said : ‘ my partner @entity28 and i were delighted when we found out			0
we could n’t wait to have another child together			0
‘ i suffered with very bad sickness from an early stage of the pregnancy			0
i spent entire days in the bathroom , near the toilet			0
‘ but more worrying than that was the fact i was also quite out of breath , so i decided to ask my doctor about it			0
’ @entity11 was delivered by c - section but after the delivery @entity42 started drifting in and out of consciousness			1
her heart then stopped numerous times and a crash team had to battle to save her life concerned , miss @entity8 visited her gp who reassured her that her breathlessness and sickness were the results of an infection and the fact she was asthmatic			1
she said : ‘ it was a struggle but the c - section was booked for the following february , so i had something to focus on			1
i battled through my discomfort			0
’ miss @entity8 had a severely damaged mitral valve			1
this valve separates the upper left heart chamber from the lower left heart chamber and helps control blood flow through the heart			2
problems with the valve can make the heart less efficient at pumping blood around the body			2
severe problems with the valve can lead to heart failure			2
to prevent this , surgery is required to replace or repair the valve			1
this operation usually involves cutting down the middle of the breastbone to access the heart			0
surgeons can then repair the valve or replace it with one made from animal tissue			2
source : @entity80 but there were troubling signs from the moment @entity42 was given a spinal block after arriving at hospital for the delivery			0
she said : ‘ as the anaesthetic began to work i felt deathly ill. my memory is patchy , but i have a clear image of @entity28 standing over me , urging me to keep calm			0
' my heart rate was fluctuating but the doctors and midwives managed to stabilise me			0
’ she was able to enjoy a moment of happiness as @entity11 was placed on her chest following the delivery , but the calm was abruptly shattered when her vital signs suddenly crashed			2
she said : ‘ the doctors rushed around me and i was aware of voices asking me to stay awake as i dipped in and out of consciousness			0
’ waking up three hours later , doctors gave a shocking assessment - her heart had stopped several times and at some points she had been just seconds from death			1
it was only the quick thinking of the crash team which had saved her life			1
a detailed scan revealed one of her heart valves had been practically destroyed			2
a bout of rheumatic fever she suffered as a child was identified as the probable cause			0
it was thought that the strain of the pregnancy with her daughter had been too much for her heart			2
she said : ‘ i already had a son , @entity126 , who ’s now four , with @entity28 , and i had a daughter summer , now eight , from a previous relationship , so it was a mystery why i had n’t suffered through those previous pregnancies			0
‘ the only certainty was that i was lucky i was in hospital when it happened - if it had n’t have been for @entity11 , i would have died			1
’ tests revealed miss @entity8 had a severely damaged heart valve which could fail at any time @entity136 ( pictured with @entity11 and partner , @entity28 ) had to have open heart surgery to replace the valve shaken , miss @entity8 was confronted with the news that she needed open heart surgery to repair her damaged valve			1
she said : ‘ the thought of leaving my children without a mother was enough to motivate me			0
although the heart surgery would be risky , i needed to make sure i would be around for them in the future , and surgery was the only way			1
’ thankfully , the operation to replace the valve in july 2013 was a success and she was able to return home to her family			1
miss @entity8 is now back at home and celebrating @entity11 's first birthday ( pictured ) she said : ‘ for the first few months of @entity11 ’s life i was ordered to have lots of bed rest			1
i was so weak i could n’t even pick her up , so there were moments when i wondered whether it would affect me bonding with her			0
‘ @entity28 was absolutely amazing , and took over all the duties for night feeds and changing nappies			0
’ @entity11 turned one last month and miss @entity8 is now fully recovered from surgery			1
she said : ‘ i need n’t have worried about not bonding with her - we ’re as close as we could be			0
i feel so proud of my whole family for coping with what i ’ve been through			0
‘ i ’m particularly proud of @entity11 , because without her i would n’t be here			2
