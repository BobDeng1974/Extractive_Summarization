we @entity1 flock to @entity2 and @entity3 , and @entity4 and @entity5 have vociferous fans			1
but what about @entity9 ? whether it ’s a @entity13 legacy or its failure to attract the stag crowd , this former @entity11 city just is n’t on our radar			1
cityscape : @entity9 's skyline , which includes here the @entity19 and the @entity20 , dazzles at dusk @entity9 is intriguing and beguiling			1
it buzzes with a youthful vibrancy similar to @entity2 ’s			1
it has history and culture in spades , plus fabulous food and drink			2
all that ’s missing are the crowds			0
@entity32 sets the tone , with its jaw - dropping grandeur			2
it ’s a station made for travel , and you feel like @entity38 , simply arriving			0
the vast arched roof , with its ribcage of girders and massive arches overwhelms , and i stand in awe			0
‘ it ’s good , yes ? ’ says a local — an understatement			0
resplendent : @entity9 's @entity32 is the largest in @entity47 , and has two grand entrance halls the cultural credentials stack up thick and fast			1
@entity50 is buried in the church of @entity52 , where he was choirmaster			0
if you visit when the organist is practising , the music ascends to the ribbed neo-gothic ceiling			0
and there is a pristine @entity50 museum opposite , with original scores and other paraphernalia			0
a macabre touch is added by the belt clasp and thimble taken from the graves of @entity50 and his wife			0
culture : @entity68 where @entity50 conducted ( left ) and the monument to the @entity70 ( right ) @entity9 claims another cultural giant , too			1
the writer @entity72 studied here in the 18th century and mentions the @entity74 , @entity9 ’s second oldest restaurant ( it dates back to the 15th century ) as the first place @entity77 is taken to by @entity78			1
i usually loathe ‘ historic ’ restaurants , but this felt genuine - and the robust @entity83 cuisine ( venison in cream sauce ) was the real thing			2
unlike nearby @entity87 , @entity9 lost only a quarter of its buildings in @entity89 , so the old city retains a strong sense of the past			1
trams clank on the edge of the old quarter ; the smell of bratwurst tantalises from stalls , while the buildings are a delightful mix of 18th century romanticism , art nouveau and @entity104 modernist			0
a very pretty city : the @entity106 in @entity9 offers plenty of places for visitors to eat or try the local brew a plaque on the side of a department store once owned by a @entity115 family — and ransacked during @entity116 in 1938 — offers a sombre reminder of the city ’s past			1
the darker side of @entity9 ’s history continues at the @entity122 — a monument built on the site of 1813 ’s @entity125			1
looming over a busy crossroads to the southeast of the city , it is a towering granite - faced edifice that was completed in 1913 , and constructed on the site of the bloodiest fighting between @entity133 ’s army and an alliance of @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
enter the monument through a massive figure carved into the base and ascend to the mausoleum			0
it feels like something out of @entity146			0
gigantic grim - faced stone knights stand , their heads bowed , in a circle			2
it ’s a testament to the folly of war , though some might see it as a @entity155 celebration of force			0
take a lift to the viewing platform for sweeping views of surrounding countryside			0
for more recent history , the @entity161 in the @entity162 is startling			0
based at the former @entity166 headquarters where the bureaucracy of communist repression was carried out , you can view the secret police ’s tools - cameras , bugging equipment , uniforms , informer lists			2
modern outlook : @entity9 's contemporary - looking @entity175 , which was built in 2004 yet this is not a city pickled in its past			1
the @entity175 was built in 2004 , and features a light installation inside its entrance , shaped like a spark plug			0
a nearby building features @entity184 ’s comic book - like representations of a mass demonstration in the city , in the late @entity187			1
these sparked similar protests which led to the fall of the communist regime			0
beer and bars feature heavily in @entity9 , of course			1
sure , you can drink the classic golden lagers of the area			2
however , you can also try @entity199 , one of the rarest beer styles in @entity47 , a sour wheat beer only produced in and around the city			2
not for the faint - hearted , it has salt and coriander in the brew but is refreshing and moreish in the glass			2
i enjoyed it with a plate of traditional pork knuckle and dumplings at the @entity214 brewpub ( you eat well in @entity9 )			1
beer on tap : the streets of @entity9 are awash with plenty of enticing bars and restaurants if beer ’s not your game , the city also majors in coffee ( @entity227 is one of the oldest surviving coffee houses in @entity47 , dating back several centuries )			1
here i sip an excellent espresso and talk with @entity232 , who moved to @entity9 from @entity87			1
‘ @entity9 is very much a young city , ’ she says			1
‘ part of the university is in the city centre , people live in the centre , all this keeps it alive			1
i wonder if she is trying to translate the @entity11 for stuffy			0
no one could accuse @entity9 of that			2
the @entity241 ( www.hotelfuerstenhofleipzig.com ) offers double rooms from £ 119 a night with breakfast			0
@entity244 ( 0871246 0000 , www.ryanair.com ) flies from @entity245 to @entity246 from £ 53 return , based on september bookings			0

@entity1 *tourists* are familiar with @entity87 and @entity2 , but often overlook @entity9
this eastern city was trapped behind the @entity255 , but has come alive
it is full of cultural *landmarks* - but also great places to eat , drink and stay
