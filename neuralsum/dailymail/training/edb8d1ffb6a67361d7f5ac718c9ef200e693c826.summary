in just over a month , @entity1 engineers will hope to make space history by landing a small robot on the surface of an icy comet for the first time			1
the craft has now beamed back a number of measurements to help make that landing a success - and they 're so accurate , they can be used by anyone to @entity14 print their own duck - shaped comet			2
mission scientists had previously only been able to say that the comet was about 2.4 miles ( 4km ) wide , but the latest data provides a more definite shape for @entity22			0
@entity1 has beamed back a number of measurements to help make that the landing a success – and they can also be used by anyone to @entity14 print their own duck - shaped comet			1
pictured is the latest shape model of @entity31 and now scientists have revealed that the head , or smaller lobe of the comet , is 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles by 1.2km ( 2.5km by 2.5km by 2km )			1
the ‘ body ’ has been measured as being 2.5 miles ( 4.1km ) by 1.9 miles ( 3.2km ) by 0.8miles ( 1.3km ) and the rate it rotates is now known to be once every 12.4043 hours			1
the images are available as			0
obj files from @entity42 ’s website , which means anyone with the appropriate software and a 3d printer will be able to create a physical model of the comet			1
as @entity1 edges closer to the comet , it is sending back increasingly clearer images of its target			1
it plans to send the @entity55 lander on the comet 's surface on november 12			1
scientists have revealed that the head , or smaller lobe of the comet , is 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles ( 2.5km by 2.5km by 2km )			1
the ' body ' has been measured as being 2.5 miles ( 4.1km ) by 1.9 miles ( 3.2km ) by 0.8miles ( 1.3km ) last week , @entity1 engineers spotted mysterious jets of water vapour spurting from the surface of comet @entity66			1
it ’s known that as the comet approaches the sun its surface will melt , expelling vapour into space , but why the vapour is appearing as jets from only certain points on the surface is unclear			1
in a blog post , @entity79 editor dr @entity78 explained that the four images are a montage taken on 26 september from a distance of 16.3 miles ( 26.3km ) from the comet ’s centre			2
' what we ’re seeing is the product of ices sublimating and gases escaping from inside the comet , carrying streams of dust out into space , ’ she wrote			0
‘ zooming in close to the surface and to the source of this activity , and it is apparent that it is originating from several discrete locations			0
’ in the image , the jets can be seen travelling into space from the comet			2
this amazing new image reveals more jets of water vapour on @entity22 ( shown )			1
the latest mosaic of the jets was created by stitching together images from @entity1			2
@entity112 of @entity113 first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery the @entity1 probe will launch its @entity55 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity22			1
the 220lb ( 100kg ) lander will reach the surface on 12 november			2
it will take around seven hours to descend			0
during the descent , images will be taken and other observations of the comet 's environment will be made			0
@entity55 will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace , using screws and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface			2
once the lander touches down , it will make a 360 ° panoramic image of the landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has landed			0
the initial science phase will then begin , with other instruments analysing the plasma and magnetic environment , and the surface and subsurface temperature			0
the lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis			0
the interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards @entity1			2
they are centered on one location , the middle of the comet , with no other part of the comet seeming to have such jets			0
this may suggest that , as the comet has orbited the sun many times before , much of its ice may have already melted			0
this would mean that only small pockets of ice melt and produce vapour in this way as it approaches - which could explain the formation of specific jets			0
as the comet approaches the sun it will become more active , and scientists will be hoping for more opportunities to view features like these			0
dr @entity78 continued : ‘ as the comet gets progressively closer to the sun along its orbit , the surface will become warmer , and the level of activity will increase , producing a vast coma around the nucleus , along with a tail			2
‘ it ’s perhaps hard to believe looking at images like this at less than 30km [ 18.6 miles ] distance from the surface , but recent gound - based images have revealed that @entity198 ’s coma already extends at least 19,000km [ 11,800 miles ] from the nucleus ! ’ in other @entity1 news , digital imaging professor @entity200 created a 3d model of the comet ’s surface , reports dr @entity112 from @entity113			1
his montage , using data from @entity1 ’s @entity207 , shows the comet as seen on 24 september 2014			2
he explained that the views were made by projecting images of the comet over a digital model			0
this 3d model of the comet 's surface was created by digital imaging professor @entity200			1
using data from @entity1 's @entity207 , it shows the comet as seen on 24 september as soon as @entity1 entered orbit around comet @entity66 in august , engineers rushed to find a landing site for its @entity55 lander - which they have now done			1
this is because , as the comet nears the sun , it will become more active , with more potentially hazardous vapour and debris released			0
and that activity was first revealed in images last month showing how the comet is indeed giving off water vapour as jets			1
as the comet ( seen in this ' selfie ' with @entity1 ) approaches the sun it will become more active			0
ice remaining on the surface will melt , surrounding the comet in gas			0
for this reason , engineers want to perform the planned landing of the @entity55 lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present in november the @entity1 probe will launch its @entity55 robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles ( 10km ) to @entity22			1
if all goes to plan , @entity55 will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace			0
the lander will drill and collect samples from beneath the surface , delivering them to an onboard laboratory for analysis earlier this week scientists picked landing site ' @entity259 ' , shown , as the location where the @entity55 lander will touch down			1
@entity259 offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites , and is also scientifically interesting , with signs of activity nearby zoom in on the image below to find out where @entity1 is at the moment			0

@entity1 has taken the most accurate measurements yet of comet
the head , or lobe of comet , is 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles by 1.2 miles
the ‘ body ’ has been measured at 2.5 miles by 1.9 miles by 0.8 miles
the icy comet is thought to rotate *fully* once every 12.4043 hours
the images are available as . wrl and . obj files from the @entity42 ’s website
anyone with modelling software and a 3d printer can create a model
recent images also revealed more jets of water vapour on @entity296
@entity42 's @entity1 *spacecraft* entered orbit around comet @entity296 in august
it plans to release @entity55 lander on to its surface on november 11
