bike - lover : @entity0 has angered cyclists after claiming they 're to blame for serious crashes			1
the mayor , left , pictured riding through a red light back in 2008 during @entity9 this week , the mayor said : ' the increase in cycling has not necessarily been accompanied by an increase ( in ) observance of the rules of the road			0
' it is very important , i think people should be aware of the high proportion			0
i have seen a figure of i think 62 per cent ... of cyclist @entity39 ( people killed and seriously injured ) are associated with some infraction by the cyclist themselves of the rules of the road			2
' @entity46 , whose sister @entity47 was killed by a lorry in 2009 , said mr @entity0 's comments were dangerous and risked pitting cyclists and drivers against each other			1

' accidents : a fellow pedaller takes a tumble at the launch of the mayor 's ' @entity77 ' scheme other critics have queried the source of the mayor 's figures - pointing to a 2009 report from the independent @entity84 which showed that motorists were entirely at fault for between 64 and 70 per cent of accidents involving adults over 25			1
a spokesperson for the mayor of @entity4 said : ' when attending a recent mayoral hustings event the mayor was told that figures indicated a high proportion of cyclists killed or seriously injured were either committing an offence or in the process of doing so			1

' in 2008 mr @entity0 was forced to backtrack after the @entity103 caught him on film breaking a number of traffic laws as he rode to work at @entity107			2
his spokesman said at the time : ' @entity0 feels strongly thatcyclists should not jump red lights and if he did so then clearlythat was a mistake and he will be more careful in thefuture			2
