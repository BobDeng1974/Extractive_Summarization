as @entity1 was wheeled into surgery to have her right breast removed , she felt no nerves - just relief that she would no longer worry about dying of cancer			1
this would be understandable had the 58 - year - old 's breast been afflicted with the disease - but it was healthy			1
while the mother - of - two had been diagnosed with an aggressive tumour in her left breast , which she had removed in october 2009 after chemotherapy , her right breast was unaffected			1
double mastectomies : @entity17 , left , was only 25 when she had her breasts removed , while @entity19 , right , did n't wait to be tested for the faulty gene that can cause cancer before taking the step @entity23 was tested for the faulty brca genes , which put carriers at high risk of breast cancer , but thankfully the results were negative			1
however , in the months after surgery , she was plagued with worry about the cancer returning and became convinced that having her healthy breast removed was the right thing to do			1
' i thought about it every day and was constantly checking for a lump , ' says @entity1 , who is married to @entity38 , 60			2
they have two sons , @entity41 , 31 , and @entity42 , 23			2
' i did n't tick any of the boxes for cancer , such as drinking , smoking , being overweight - yet i still got it			1
so why could n't i get it again ? ' @entity1 is not alone			2
she is one of a growing number of women choosing to have double mastectomies even though they do n't need them			1
some regrets : @entity19 , pictured pre-op , now wishes she gave it more thought a quarter of women who develop cancer in one breast now ask for both to be removed , according to figures from the @entity61			1
some people i told thought i was mad and could n't understand why i wanted the breast gone experts say the surge is due in part to the influence of actress @entity69 , who earlier this year had a preventative double mastectomy after discovering she had the faulty @entity72 gene			1
yet many women requesting double mastectomies do not carry such a gene , and have a much smaller chance of cancer in the unaffected breast			1
doctors have warned that the ' jolie - effect ' means women may be putting their health at risk , and some may suffer scarring or psychological issues as a result of having both their breasts removed unnecessarily			1
better safe than sorry : @entity1 had her healthy right breast removed because she feared cancer yet many women who push for the surgery - often against the advice of doctors - feel the peace of mind they gain is worth the risk			1
' some people i told thought i was mad and could n't understand why i wanted the breast gone - but it was important to me , ' says @entity1 , who lives in @entity101 , @entity102			1
she says she was petrified at the thought of receiving another cancer diagnosis , and of more chemotherapy , which had caused hair loss and crushing fatigue - yet her doctor was unwilling to put her forward for surgery			1
' my doctors would n't do it , ' she says			2
' they said they couldn ' ’ t just remove healthy tissue and that i 'd feel differently in two years			2
but i knew i would n't			2
' she also struggled with her new shape			2
' i did n’t feel ready for reconstruction , and so i was left with one normal breast and one prosthesis			1
they did n’t match , and i was always uncomfortable			2
' she brought it up with a different consultant during a check - up last year and found him more sympathetic			2
in october last year , she had the surgery			0
' it 's the best thing i 've done , ' she says			0
' it 's just such a weight off my mind			0
' @entity1 chose not to have a reconstruction , and now uses prostheses - or nothing at all			1
' i do ballet , and when i go to classes i just wear my leotard ; on holiday i wear a ruched bikini			0
' i feel just as feminine , and my husband says i look beautiful			0
' while @entity1 opted not to have a reconstruction , some doctors believe improvements in reconstructive surgery are a factor in encouraging more women to have healthy breasts removed			1
@entity146 , consultant breast surgeon and chairman of @entity148 , says : ' women are less afraid of mastectomies than they were in the past			1
more women are surviving than ever before , and those survivors are afraid of developing a second cancer			1
' so many are requesting their healthy breasts removed that @entity157 recently looked into the reasons			1
the most common reasons among those without a faulty gene were anxiety about being diagnosed again , the stress of chemotherapy , and wanting symmetrical breasts after reconstruction			0
' as long as the decision is made after careful thought , my view is it is logical , ' says mr @entity146			0
age risks the biggest risk factor for breast cancer ( other than gender ) is age - 81 per cent occur in women over 50 ' the only people we dissuade are those with a very low risk of cancer in the opposite breast - for example , a woman with a low - risk cancer who isin her 60s or 70s			1
it does n’t make sense at that age			0
' whatever the circumstances , it ’s never an easy decision to make			0
@entity17 , 26 , was diagnosed with breast cancer in april last year , when her daughter @entity193 was just 10 months old			1
' the doctors recommended a mastectomy , ' says @entity17 who lives with her husband @entity196 , 28 , and @entity193 , now two , in @entity197 , @entity198			0
' we decided i ’d also be tested for faulty genes , because my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43			1
' no worries : @entity1 , pictured with her husband , said the operation means she no longer lives in fear of breast cancer but the results did n’t come back before her surgery , so @entity17 made the brave choice to have both breasts removed , just in case			1
' if i had the faulty gene , i ’d need a double mastectomy and i could n't face surgery again , ' she says			1
' i thought i must have the gene , because @entity218 had it and because i 'd got cancer so young			1
my mum had a single mastectomy and was constantly worried it was going to come back on the other side			0
i did n't want to go through that			0
' it was awful , though			0
i could n't have reconstructive surgery done straight away as i had to have radiotherapy first			0
role model : but @entity69 's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading since not everyone can afford the best reconstructive surgery ' i was only 25 and i ’d lost both my breasts - i thought i ’d never look the same			1
i also worried what @entity196 would think , but he ’s always been totally supportive			0
' in a cruel twist of fate , after she 'd had her double mastectomy , the genetic test results came back showing @entity17 was not a carrier			1
' i was relieved for my daughter and sister , ' says @entity17 , ' but i made the right decision			0
i did what i could to see my little girl grow up			0
' surgeon professor @entity244 at the @entity61 says doctors must ensure women are well informed about the risks			2
' in general , a doctor will do what the patient wants , but it ’s important we explain that they may not benefit in terms of survival			0
' that 's because if they do go on to get cancer in the other breast , the likelihood is it will be picked up earlier than the first cancer			1
' they must also be made aware of the psychosexual effect a mastectomy can have			0
it should only be done after careful consideration			0
' @entity19 is one woman who wishes she ’d given more thought to undergoing an elective double mastectomy in march 2010			2
she watched as breast cancer struck three of her aunts , and then her mother in 2004			1
tests showed her mother carried the faulty @entity274 gene			0
@entity19 did n't want to wait to be tested herself , and had both her breasts removed			2
' i could n't let my daughters go through what i 'd been through , and i wanted to show them there was a way to protect yourself , ' says @entity19 , 32 , who lives in @entity282 , @entity283 , and is mother to @entity285 , ten , and @entity286 , four			0
@entity19 had surgery in march 2010 , but suffered complications and had to have a further operation which left her disfigured			0
she now suffers with terrible pain from scar tissue and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression			0
preventative : @entity17 said her mastectomy was the right decision so she can see her little girl grow up ' i now worry my daughters will never want to do what i did because they 've seen how it affected me			0
' women really need to think about what they ’re doing			2
look at the surgeon who ’ll be doing the operation and take the counselling you ’re offered beforehand			0
' i really do n’t think anyone should do it unless it 's absolutely necessary			0
' @entity19 warns the publicity around @entity69 's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading			1
' her breasts look brilliant , but she has got the money to spend on it			0
not everyone will look like her			0
' but for women like @entity1 , the risks are outweighed by feeling she has protected herself from a life - threatening disease			2
' when i was told i had cancer , i felt like i 'd been thrown into a black hole			2
i thought about not living to see my grandchildren			0
' i do n't ever want to have to experience that again			0
