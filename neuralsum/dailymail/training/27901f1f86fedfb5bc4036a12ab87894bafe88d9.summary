exceeding the limit : the @entity48 in @entity24 , @entity11 where reverend @entity6 was most recently caught speeding ' i will be making every effort to fulfil all my parish commitments through a mixture of taxis , lifts and bicycle and i am fortunate that my parishes , the hospitals and crematorium are all within a relatively small area of @entity11			2
