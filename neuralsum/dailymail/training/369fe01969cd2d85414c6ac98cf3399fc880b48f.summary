by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 12:37 est , 13 march 2014 if you want to join the likes of @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 in having a @entity7 it 's easy - you just need £ 50,000 in your back pocket			1
a lost prize which surfaced in a @entity11 pawn shop is going under the hammer , becoming only the second ever to be auctioned			1
the 23 - carat solid gold medal was awarded to @entity16 's foreign minister in 1936 for his role ending a brutal @entity11 war which killed 100,000 people			1
after he died in 1959 , however , the prize 's whereabouts were unknown for decades			1
priceless : this @entity7 , awarded to @entity16 's foreign minister in 1936 , was thought to have been lost but will be auctioned later this month - 20 years after it surfaced in a @entity11 pawn shop now it has emerged the medal was traded in at a pawn shop in @entity11 20 years ago			1
whoever brought the prize to the shop may have had no idea of its true value , instead trading the 222.4g piece for the value of its gold			2
historic : the award was given to @entity39 , its first @entity40 recipient , in 1936 instead of revealing it , the pawnbroker sold it to a @entity45 dealer who he had done business with before			1
he took it back to his home country and sold it to another dealer , who then sold it to the @entity57 collection - a pseudonym for a wealthy collector who died more than 10 years ago			1
the man 's descendants have now decided to sell it , meaning its history can be revealed			0
the solid gold medal will be auctioned in @entity66 by @entity69 's @entity68 's @entity67 on march 27 and the value of its gold alone is said to be $ 9,168 ( £ 5,521 )			1
@entity73 , a specialist in historical medals and a consultant to @entity68 's @entity76 , told @entity77 : ' the words @entity7 are only engraved in @entity79 on the edge so they might not have known what they had and thought " oh , it 's just another gold medal "			1
' there are an awful lot of gold medals in the world and most of them are only worth the value of their bullion			0
' the dealer who bought it from @entity11 is protecting his source and wo n't tell us where the shop was , something that 's quite common in the antiques and coin world			1
' had the shop owner not recognized that it might be worth more to somebody than just the value of the bullion ... it would have been melted and thrown in with broken gold earrings			1
' the medal has a tiny file mark on the edge , which mr @entity73 said was a sign someone had tried to work out how pure the gold was in case it was melted down			2
he added : ' i would say it 's more famous than an olympic gold medal			1
' when you look at the list of past recipients , they 're obviously some of the most important people to walk the face of the globe in the last 100 - plus years			2
' this was definitely special			0
what struck me was how heavy it is - it 's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand			1
' detail : the back of the gold medal , first awarded in 1901 , features three men in a fraternal bond with the @entity140 inscription : ' @entity141 et fraternitate gentium ' ( ' for the peace and brotherhood of men ' ) legacy : the front of the medal features the @entity150 industrialist @entity149 , who founded the prize the @entity7 was one of five created by the @entity150 industrialist @entity149 , who invented dynamite , and was first awarded in 1901			1
its most famous recipients have included @entity5 , @entity4 and @entity6			0
the other prizes are for chemistry , physics , medicine and literature			0
' i ca n't think of many public collections that have a @entity163 , never mind a @entity7 medal , ' said @entity165 , executive director of the @entity166			0
' this was definitely special			0
what struck me was how heavy it is - it 's almost half a pound of gold so it has a significant heft to it in your hand			2
' - medals specialist @entity73 ' this is an incredible rarity			0
' other @entity163 awards have sold at auction , but only one other @entity7 is known to have come under the hammer			0
the 1903 medal awarded to sir @entity183 , the @entity183 mp who was a champion of free speech and created @entity185 in @entity187 's @entity186 through an @entity188 , sold for £ 11,550 ( $ 16,748 ) in 1985 at @entity189			1
the 1936 prize is expect to fetch at least $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 ( £ 30,106 to £ 60,212 )			1
the @entity57 collection also owned a @entity192 , one of the world 's most prestigious journalism and arts awards			0
it will be sold alongside the @entity7 at the same auction - becoming the first gold @entity192 medal ever to go under the hammer			1
the 14 - carat gold medallion was presented to the newspaper @entity202 in 1933 for a series of articles exposing scam lottery schemes			1
the newspaper also won the award for stories on veterans ' relief , real estate bonds and a campaign urging voters in @entity69 to vote for @entity214 @entity213 by ' writing in ' his name despite the fact he did not appear on the ballot			0
founded when the @entity219 and @entity220 merged two years earlier , the newspaper only survived for three more decades and was merged into a string of unsuccessful titles in 1966			2
the pulitzer prize is expected to fetch between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 ( £ 9,033 and £ 18,066 )			2
the public service award is the only category of the prize to be awarded a gold medal			2
all the others receive monetary awards			0
rare : the only other @entity7 ever to be auctioned was given to the pacifist and trade unionist sir @entity183 ( pictured ) in 1903			0
he was its first solo recipient and helped found @entity233 in @entity187 sale : the same collector owned this @entity192 , which will be the first ever auctioned war : the winner of the 1936 prize helped to end the @entity239 between @entity240 and @entity241 which broke out over several land disputes and killed 100,000 men			2
pictured : soldiers drinking in @entity241 held : some of the 7,000 @entity241 prisoners captured in march 1935 by @entity240 forces while @entity248 was distracted by @entity249 in the 1930s , a brutal war was killing tens of thousands of people in @entity11			2
fought between @entity240 and @entity241 , the @entity239 lasted from 1933 to 1935 over a 100,000 square mile wilderness and was the culmination of tensions which had lasted several decades			2
clashes : residents of @entity257 in @entity240 gather to demonstrate against @entity241 in 1932 when the @entity259 ended in 1884 , @entity258 defeated @entity240 and annexed @entity240 's coast , leaving its citizens landlocked and frustrated			0
so @entity240 started encroaching onto @entity241 , which initiated a string of clashes in december 1928 - clashes which led to a full - scale war despite the efforts of the @entity45			2
a truce was finally arranged on june 12 , 1935 , in a peace conference which included @entity16 , @entity269 , @entity258 , @entity270 , @entity271 , and the @entity45			1
it allowed @entity241 to have clear ownership of most of the disputed region , but @entity240 was given a corridor to the @entity276 and a port , @entity278			0
most of the credit went to @entity16 's foreign minister @entity39 , who was the key figure behind the truce			1
he became the first person from outside @entity248 and the @entity45 to receive the @entity7			0
he was also crucial to @entity16 joining the @entity284 in 1932			0
in his mid-fifties when he won the prestigious award , he came from landed gentry and gained a phd in law before becoming a professor of constitutional law			0
he won his first elected post aged 30 and later became the minister of justice and minister of education before heading the country 's foreign affairs for six years			1
why the medal left his family and ended up in a pawn shop is a mystery			1
mr @entity73 told @entity77 : ' he had a son , and his son had a son - but after that the trail goes cold			0
the grandson died at some time in the ' 70s			0
' it may have ended up in some distant part of the family where they did n't care about it or maybe they just needed the money			0
' it does seem odd but sometimes people just do n't care about their family history that much			0

the 23 - carat medal was awarded to @entity16 's foreign minister in 1936
it was lost for decades and sold only for its scrap value 20 years ago
@entity45 collector discovered it existed and went to @entity11 pawn shop
