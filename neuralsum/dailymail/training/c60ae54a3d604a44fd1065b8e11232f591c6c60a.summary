by @entity0 published : 01:04 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 16:39 est , 30 may 2012 it could soon be illegal to ask a woman to stop breastfeeding in public places after mothers have campaigned to make it a civil right			1
a group in @entity8 has been pushing lawmakers to make it a crime to ask women feeding their babies to cover up or leave the premises			1
breastfeeding in public is already legal in the city - but council member @entity17 said enshrining breastfeeding as a civil right would have a multitude of health benefits for the mother and child along with lowering infant mortality rates			1
one new mother @entity38 told the council : ' who wants to feed their baby in a bathroom stall ? would you bring your lunch to a bathroom stall ? ' another mother @entity46 told @entity47 how she was once asked by a shop assistant to feed her baby in a changing room at the store to prevent other customers from being offended			2
following the council meeting , around a dozen mothers gathered for a ' feed in ' at council buildings			0
however not all @entity8 residents were on board with the idea			1
@entity60 told @entity61 : ' i can see where a lot of people would be really uncomfortable in certain situations			0
' breast is best : mothers listened to arguments at the meeting before staging a ' feed - in ' at the council buildings laws on breastfeeding varied from state to state			2
according to @entity79 last year , in the state of @entity78 , for example , the law protected breastfeeding in public but only of a one - year - old or younger			0
in @entity83 , however , it had been ruled that breastfeeding discrimination is sexual discrimination			0
by comparison , @entity87 law states a right to breastfeed on state - owned property only			0
@entity8 council is expected to come to a decision this monday , april 9			1
