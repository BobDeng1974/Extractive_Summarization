former federal prosecutor @entity0 said he was set to indict several @entity2 politicians and businessmen before he was removed from the case the original federal prosecutor assigned to investigate @entity6 and @entity8 's alleged involvement in the so - called @entity10 scandal has told how he was set to indict several high - level @entity2 politicians and businessmen before being removed from the case			1
former @entity13 attorney @entity0 claims he uncovered ' serious crimes ' while investigating the affair in the early 1990s and was left angry and frustrated when a panel of federal judges replaced him on the grounds he was not independent enough			1
and in a forthcoming memoir mr @entity0 tells how his team viewed @entity21 - the man who famously accused @entity22 of pressuring him to provide an illegal $ 300,000 loan - as a ' credible witness '			1
mr @entity0 said that by the summer of 1994 , he was preparing to bring eight indictments against 11 defendants			0
these included criminal charges for fraud against the @entity31 ' @entity10 business partners @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity8 's former law partner and associate attorney general @entity34 and @entity22 's successor as governor of @entity2 , @entity36			1
mr @entity0 claims his removal as prosecutor was a major blow to the investigation and caused the probe to drag on far longer than it should have			1
his replacement @entity45 was a former federal appellate judge who had no prosecutorial experience			0
mr @entity0 told @entity48 : ' the simplest way to put it , after i was replaced , the lawyers on the staff in @entity2 said the agents for the @entity54 and @entity55 were totally demoralized			2
' they thought we were on the brink of doing all these great things , and now that was not going to happen			0
' @entity6 and @entity8 pictured in 19992			0
the affair dogged the couple throughout mr @entity22 's years as president			2
he has always strenuously denied any wrong doing the scandal which dogged @entity22 throughout his years as president began when a @entity65 investigator submitted a criminal referral to the @entity54 naming @entity6 and @entity8 as witnesses in the failure of @entity69 , a business owned by the @entity22 's business partners @entity32 and @entity33			1
claims : former municipal judge @entity21 accused mr @entity22 of pressuring him to make an illegal $ 300,000 loan although the @entity76 and the @entity54 believed the referral lacked merit , the investigator , @entity74 , issued several additional referrals against the @entity31			1
after these became public knowledge , she testified before the @entity81 in 1994			0
but the most incendiary allegations against the @entity31 came from @entity21 , the owner of a federally subsidized small - business lending company and a former municipal judge			2
@entity21 claimed that @entity22 had pressured him to make an illegal $ 300,000 federally - backed loan to @entity69			1
he claimed the money was to be used to pay off the @entity31 and the @entity33 's debts following the failed @entity10 real estate project			0
according to @entity21 , @entity22 told him : ' my name ca n't show up on this '			1
the @entity31 have always streneously denied the allegations , deriding the entire affair as little more than a politically - motivated smear campaign			0
their supporters point to the fact that @entity21 failed to mention the @entity31 during the original @entity54 investigation of @entity69 in 1989			2
three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence to link the @entity31 to any crimes			0
however the @entity101 were convicted following a @entity13 @entity103 investigation			2
@entity33 served 18 months in prison after being held in contempt of court after refusing to answer any questions relating to @entity10			0
she was granted a pardon by president @entity22 just before leaving office			2
@entity22 's successor as @entity2 governor , @entity36 , also served time in prison after his role in the fraud was revealed			0
the @entity10 affair is likely to return to haunt @entity8 if she runs for president in his book mr @entity0 tells how @entity21 's information helped the investigation and that his team had vetted @entity21 's story			1
he added : ' standing alone , nobody was going to bring a case based on what he was telling us			0
' but from what we had seen of him , we thought the story was plausible and was certainly worth pursuing			0
' curiously mr @entity0 was hauled off the case because he had been appointed by @entity22 's attorney general - which the conservative federal judges claime meant he was not independent enough			1
while little new has emerged surrounding the case in recent years it looks set to come back to haunt @entity8 if she runs for president .			1
