by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:46 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 25 april 2013 @entity2 is warning @entity3 he will get the blame if he blocks a temporary withdrawal from the @entity6 to enable the deportation of @entity8			0
sources close to the prime minister made clear he would expect the @entity11 leader – who has insisted he will not countenance any suspension of the @entity6 – to explain to voters why the hate preacher remained in @entity15 in such circumstances			1
home secretary @entity17 told @entity18 yesterday that she has signed a new treaty with @entity8 ’s native @entity20 which , she believes , will mean the courts finally allowing his removal			1
hate preacher @entity8 has been the subject of an on - going battle between the government and @entity6 but she said the government was also examining a temporary suspension of the @entity6 if all else failed			0
‘ i believe we should look at all the options and that should include leaving the jurisdiction of the court altogether , ’ she told mps			0
‘ the prime minister is looking at all the options			0
’ mr @entity3 was kept in the dark about a ‘ council of war ’ ordered by mr @entity2 on wednesday , as the @entity37 refused the @entity39 permission to take @entity41 ’s case to the @entity42			1
the @entity43 told the home secretary , justice secretary @entity45 and attorney general @entity46 that it was ‘ intolerable ’ that @entity41 remained in @entity15			1
today mr @entity3 ruled out changing the law to accelerate the process			0
he told @entity50 : ' no one ’s proposed and certainly no one ’s put to me this idea that we should somehow suddenly start , i do n’t know , pulling out of this or that international agreement			0
he insisted : ' i want to get rid of @entity8			0
i am as impatient as anybody in the government to do so			0
' of course this government is not going to act illegally			0
' however , he added that he was ' quietly a little bit more optimistic ' that @entity15 would kick @entity41 out and praised mrs may for doing a ' fantastically good job '			1
tussle : @entity3 , pictured today visiting the @entity65 in @entity66 , was kept in the dark about a ' council of war ' ordered by @entity2 mr @entity46 is also nderstood to be fiercely opposed to any move to leave the @entity6 , and @entity69 , the cabinet office minister , publicly dismissed the idea			1
mr @entity69 , a former lord chancellor , said : ‘ it ’s not the policy of this government to withdraw either from a short period or for a lengthy period from the @entity6			2
’ even if the @entity15 did withdraw , he added , it would have little impact on the @entity41 case because @entity79 common law would prevent his deportation if there was a risk of torture			1
the home secretary said a treaty containing a ' fair trials guarantee ' had been struck with @entity20 ‘ you ’re not going to get a @entity15 court to deport anybody for trial to a country where torture is going to be involved , you never have , you never will , ’ mr @entity69 said			1
a @entity94 source , however , insisted mr @entity2 was ‘ deadly serious ’ about a temporary withdrawal from the convention if the courts refused to accept the new treaty			0
the source added : ‘ the prime minister is willing to see every avenue pursued			0
this is a priority for him and for the @entity15 people			2
‘ frankly , if anyone wants to be the person that keeps @entity8 in this country then they will need to stand up and make that argument			0
’ in the @entity110 , the home secretary said a treaty containing a ‘ fair trials guarantee ’ had been struck with @entity20 and would reassure @entity15 courts that torture evidence would not be used against the terrorist suspect			1
but she warned : ‘ even when the treaty is fully ratified , it will not mean that @entity41 will be on a plane to @entity20 within days			1
‘ we will be able to issue a new deportation decision , but @entity41 will still have legal appeals available to him , and it will therefore be up to the courts to make the final decision			1
that legal process may well still take many months , but in the meantime i believe @entity41 should remain behind bars			2
’ several @entity129 mps suggested that the government should simply ignore the @entity132 and @entity15 courts and deport @entity41 anyway			1
mrs may said : ‘ the answer i give is the same as i have given in the past – i believe the @entity130 should abide by the rule of law			0
’ @entity8 is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity in @entity20 to coincide with the millennium			2
his removal to stand trial there was originally approved by the @entity15 courts , only to be overruled by the @entity143 last year			2
@entity132 judges said they feared he would not get a fair trial because evidence obtained through torture might be used against him			2
the home secretary then sought assurances from @entity20 that there would be no use of torture , but an immigration tribunal ruled the assurances were not reliable and halted his removal			1
@entity8 , who has been resident in the @entity15 since september 1993 , was returned to jail earlier this month after he was arrested for alleged bail breaches .			0

home secretary says treaty with ' fair trials guarantee ' has been struck with @entity20
@entity69 says even if @entity15 withdraws it would not impact on @entity41 because @entity79 common law prevents deportation if there is torture risk
