@entity1 secretary @entity0 met privately with dozens of governors sunday as the @entity4 administration tried to get support from the leaders of states that will host thousands of the @entity9 children who have crossed the @entity11 border on their own since oct. 1			1
governors of both parties expressed concerns about the cost to states , including providing public education for the children , according to those who attended the meeting			1
@entity0 left the meeting through a side door without talking to reporters			2
' our citizens already feel burdened by all kinds of challenges			0
they do n't want to see another burden come into their state , ' said @entity30 gov. @entity29 , a @entity31			1
' however we deal with the humanitarian aspects of this , we 've got to do it in the most cost - effective way possible			0
' @entity37 gov. @entity36 , @entity39 gov. @entity38 and @entity41 gov. @entity40 were among the most vocal @entity43 critics			1
they seized on the administration 's plans to place the children with friends or family members without checking on their immigration status			1
from there , they often are reunited with parents or placed with other relatives already living in the country , while they wait for an immigration court to decide their future			0
the court process can take years			0
neither @entity0 's agency nor immigration officials check the immigration status of relatives who take custody of the immigrant children			1
since oct. 1 more than 57,000 children have crossed the border alone			2
most are from @entity90 , @entity91 or @entity92			0
' we want to make sure they 're placed in a safe and supportive home or placement , but also , it should be somebody that is legal and somebody that will be responsible to see that they show up for the hearing , ' @entity40 said			0
according to data from the @entity106 's @entity105 , about a quarter of immigrants facing deportations hearings do n't show up as ordered			2
the no - show rate for the juvenile immigration court docket is about 46 percent			2
amid the debate of what is causing the ongoing crush of child immigrants and how the government can stem the flow , two key lawmakers said president @entity4 can take administrative action to relieve much of the crisis without waiting for what is likely to be a contentious and lengthy @entity122 battle			1
at issue is a provision in a 2008 human trafficking law that puts the fate of these immigrants in the hands of immigration judges			0
the @entity4 administration has expressed some interest in asking @entity122 to change the law to give the administration more leeway in dealing with the crisis			1
four hundred child immigrants now enter the @entity69 illegally every day as authorities liken growing humanitarian crises in makeshift centers to the aftermath of @entity140 but rep. @entity141 , a @entity142 @entity43 and chairman of the @entity144 , said sunday that wholesale changes by @entity122 may not be necessary and that @entity4 has the authority to return the children to their native countries			1
@entity4 ' has tools in his toolbox ' to deal with humanitarian issues and deter more children from coming to the @entity69 , @entity141 said			2
' we can safely get them home , ' @entity141 said on @entity156 's ' @entity155			0
' he said , ' and that 's where the president needs to start			2
so he needs to re-engage , get folks who are doing administrative work on the border			0
they need to make sure they send a very clear signal			0
' @entity62 sen. @entity166 of @entity167 , the author of the provision in the human trafficking law , said a change in regulations , not the law , could speed the children 's return			1
the law already allows @entity1 and the @entity175 to write regulations to deal with ' exceptional circumstances ' that would allow officials to return the children more quickly to their home countries , @entity166 said thursday at a hearing on a $ 3.7 billion emergency budget request from the @entity182 to deal with the growing crisis on the border			1
some of the money would go to help fund about 40 additional immigration judge teams			0
federal immigration courts have a backlog of more than 375,000 cases .			0
