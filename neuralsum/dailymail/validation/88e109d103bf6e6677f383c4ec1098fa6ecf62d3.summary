it 's a measure of the growing confidence at @entity10 , which is finally turning around a decades - long sales decline			1
and it 's a nod to the importance of @entity61 , where customers know the @entity10 name and appreciate brands with a rich history			2

thrilled by the reception he got as he drove the elegant sedan around @entity121 , @entity116 made the @entity10 part of @entity10 's lineup			1
the @entity10 soon became the pinnacle of @entity126 luxury			2

@entity80 's designs got dull and failed to stand out from lower - priced @entity11			1
the @entity10 was also squeezed by competition from the midsize @entity67 , which debuted in 2000 , and the bigger @entity192			2
@entity11 also underestimated the threat posed by @entity195 rivals , who were expanding their lineups , and newer @entity199 luxury brands			2

it appears to be working			0

the @entity10 was squeezed by competition from the midsize @entity67 , which debuted in 2000 , and the bigger @entity192 but globally , the segment is growing , @entity78 says			0
@entity11 has high hopes for the @entity10 brand in @entity61 , where it 's opening dazzling new dealerships complete with waterfalls			1

the moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button			0
another button automatically moves the front passenger seat forward and fully reclines the rear passenger seat			0
that 's another nod to @entity61 , where luxury car owners often have their own drivers			0
under the hood is a 3 - liter @entity292 engine that 's unique to @entity80			0
@entity11 is n't yet revealing more details , like whether the car is front - or rear - wheel drive			2
