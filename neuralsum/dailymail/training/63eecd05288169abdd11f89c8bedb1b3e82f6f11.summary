in december last year , @entity0 went on a day trip for work and for the first time ever she left her eight - month - old son @entity3 behind			1
when she returned from @entity4 , @entity5 , to her hometown of @entity7 to collect @entity3 from a family member she noticed he was unsettled and seemed like he had a sore throat			2
for three days doctors insisted he had bronchiolitis , but ms @entity0 , 37 , was unconvinced and when she took him to hospital three days later an x-ray revealed he had a lithium - ion battery lodged in his throat			1
now 10 months old , @entity3 faces an uncertain future and months in hospital intensive care as ms @entity0 comes to terms with the fact he may never speak or breathe unassisted			1
@entity3 , now 10 months old , from @entity7 in @entity5 , swallowed a lithium - ion battery his mother @entity0 has to come to terms with the fact he may never speak or breathe unassisted ' in the beginning it seemed so surreal , i kept thinking " is this really happening ? " ' she told @entity31			1
' and it 's a process of the more you know , the more you realise how bad things are			2
' ms @entity0 said after she picked @entity3 up on the evening of december 15 - a monday – he started wheezing as he breathed			1
@entity3 pictured before his horrific injury ' the doctor thought he had bronchiolitis , and i did question that at the time , the wheezing seemed to not be coming from his lungs but almost in his throat , ' she said			1
' by wednesday evening he had n't improved at all , which i thought the medicine should have given him some improvement			0
' we were given asthma medication to open up and relax his throat but i could n't do it , it was too upsetting for me , he became too distressed using the spacer			0
' on thursday morning @entity3 still had n't improved so ms @entity0 took him to the emergency department at the hospital , where he was given an x-ray within 20 minutes			1
the x-ray revealed the battery in his throat , with subsequent tests showing it had caused major internal corrosive burns			2
' when they 're inside the body the acids , excretions and moisture amplifies the electric charge [ of the battery ] , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' it increases the rate of corrosion so the battery is actually speeding up the process of tissue damage			0
' while the battery had been lodged low in his oesophagus it had actually corroded the tissue right through and caused a hole in oesophagus right through to his trachea			1
' in addition an abscess formed with the laryngeal nerve – the nerve which controls his voice box – running right through it			0
' we ca n't leave hospital , he ca n't breathe , ' ms @entity0 said			1
' it 's been two months now , but we expect to be here a long time			0
' @entity3 has undergone three major operations and more than 30 other smaller procedures			2
an x-ray revealed a battery in his throat , with subsequent tests showing it had caused internal corrosive burns in addition an abscess formed , with the nerve which controls his voice box running right through it he is confined to his hospital bed , and can only sit up out of bed if he 's held by a family member			1
this is particularly heartbreaking for ms @entity0 , who last year was watching her son meet all his milestones early			1
' he was meeting them and blowing them away , ' she said			0
' he was pulling himself to standing			0
he started crawling at six months			0
' he was saying words like " @entity121 " and " @entity122 "			0
" @entity122 " was his favourite			0
' ms @entity0 has to be by her son 's side every day and is now living at @entity4 's @entity127 house with her six - year - old daughter			1
she had spent years building up her own successful human resources and employment law business but has had to let her clients go to be there for @entity3			2
with her main source of income gone , her sister has set up a fundraising page to help the family cover their living and medical expenses			0
ms @entity0 has to be by her son 's side every day and is now living at @entity4 's @entity127 house with her six - year - old daughter @entity3 is confined to his hospital bed , and can only sit up out of bed if he 's held by a family member but ms @entity0 said even more important than raising money was telling her story to spread a warning about the danger of batteries to other parents			1
' i 'm anally - retentive , vacuum cleaning , ocd tidier upperer , ' she said			0
' and these things are so prevalent in our homes , from kitchen scales to little bedside alarm clocks , car keys , digital remotes from @entity163 docking stations			0
' ' they seem so benign and that 's the way we treat them but they 're not they 're incredibly dangerous			0
' ms @entity0 said battery wounds can be fatal within a few hours			2
' we do n't always have eyes in the back of our heads so it can happen to anybody and you 've just got to be so aware of how dangerous they are , ' she said			0
' if our story shows one parent the dangers and saves one family from this journey to hell that we 've been on and the tortuous situation for @entity3 and what it means for his future then it 's worth it			2

@entity0 's baby son @entity3 swallowed a lithium - ion battery
it corroded his oesophagus and wind pipe and now he may never be able to talk or breathe without the assistance of a machine
for days doctors said he had bronchiolitis before took him to get an x-ray
