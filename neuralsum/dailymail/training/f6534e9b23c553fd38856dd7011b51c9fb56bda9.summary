in front of a stadium of screaming crowds , three @entity1 whales dance , wave and high - five			1
it seems like innocent entertainment , attracting thousands to @entity8 in @entity9 every day			1
but today , the company that owns the park and dozens of others worldwide , including @entity13 , has been accused of animal cruelty and ‘ double standards ’			1
its websites state : ' @entity43 believes it is wrong to keep whales and dolphins in captivity			2
no matter how spacious , no captive facility can ever provide such far - ranging , highly social and highly intelligent animals with the stimulation they need for a good quality of life			2
' however , the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , an international animal rights organisation , has today accused the firm of hypocrisy , releasing footage of @entity22 , @entity23 1 , and @entity38 entertaining crowds on march 3 , 2014 – two years after @entity18 purchased the park in march 2012			1
@entity22 , @entity23 1 , and @entity24 perform to an audience of 2,000 three times a day			1
born in the wild , they were captured and taken to @entity65 around five years ago			2
@entity23 1 and @entity66 were and transferred to the park in eastern @entity65 in 2011 , where @entity22 had already been for at least a year			1
@entity18 claims the performances at @entity8 have been altered to only involve natural movements as they look for a @entity1 whale sanctuary			1
the firm bought the @entity9 aquarium in 2012 with a high - pitched twitter , and bright white skin , @entity1 whales have been hunted for centuries			1
unlike many marine animals , they can swim backwards , but do not jump out of the water like dolphins and killer whales			2
they have an acute sense of hearing that makes them more sensitive to human noise pollution than most other whales			2
scientists have found their hearing is the same both in and out of the water			2
a spokesman for @entity18 claims the past two years have been spent finding a natural sanctuary for @entity22 and the two @entity93			1
in the meantime , the spokesman added , their routine has been altered to reflect their natural behaviour			2
blasting the performances as ‘ unnatural ’ , a spokesman for @entity55 has accused @entity18 of ‘ wasting time ’			1
captivity : the highly sensitive animals were born in the wild , captured and taken to @entity65 where they now perform in a 2,000 - capacity stadium three times a day director of @entity55 @entity110 , who is campaigning to return the @entity1 to the wild , said : ' @entity43 claims to be opposed to the keeping of highly intelligent and sentient animals , like dolphins and whales , in captivity and yet forces @entity1 whales to perform demeaning tricks for screaming crowds every day in its overseas operation			1
' whilst it is clearly within the animals ' abilities to be able to do these things , it is very different to this being a demonstration of natural behaviour			0
whales do not dance , wave or sing to crowds of thousands of screaming people			1
' the controversy will come as an embarrassment for the global corporation just months after it successfully petitioned to block @entity136 rival @entity135 from importing @entity138 beluga whales from the wild to perform			1
' @entity43 claims to be opposed to the keeping of highly intelligent and sentient animals , like dolphins and whales , in captivity and yet forces @entity1 whales to perform demeaning tricks for screaming crowds every day in its overseas operation ' - @entity54 director @entity110 marine biologist @entity146 , of @entity40 charity @entity147 , said : ' we fail to see why a large commercial organisation such as @entity150 , owned by @entity18 , is taking so long to establish a sanctuary			1
' whilst we appreciate this must be carried out with the utmost care for the welfare of any animals involved , there have been cases of release of captive whales and dolphins in the past which have been achieved fairly quickly with a very tight budget			0
' a spokesman for @entity18 defended the set up as a situation they have been working to rectify			1
the firm is working with the @entity166 lobbying @entity167 to ban dolphinariums			1
the spokesman said : ' since 2012 we have been exhaustively exploring all possible options for these whales , with their long term welfare the highest priority			0
' we have spared no energy in pursuit of a solution , and we believe that we are very close to finding an excellent new home for them			0
' in the meantime however we have invested in improving their existing environment - something we did the moment we took over – and in changing the nature of shows so that they only reflect the natural behaviours of the animals – no tricks			0
' she added that a potential site for a dolphin sanctuary to house their bottle - nose dolphins in @entity167 has been found : ' at present we are wholly focused on progressing the sanctuary project and would obviously only undertake the necessary suitability assessment on these three animals once it was established that work on a @entity199 could commence and a likely " date of readiness " established			2
' we are happy that the arrangements made for them in the interim , are the best we could have made , in respect of their health and general well - being			0
' delicacy : in the 19th century , demand surged for the skin of @entity1 whales to be used for leather bright white , with a vast range of vocal tones , @entity1 whales have been hunted for centuries for zoos			1
