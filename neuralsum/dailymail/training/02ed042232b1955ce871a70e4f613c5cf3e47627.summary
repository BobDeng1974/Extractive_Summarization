by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the number of singletons has risen by 3million in a decade , as more of us choose to live on our own , according to new research			2
a detailed analysis of the state of the nation reveals that in some areas more than half of people are unattached , with @entity12 topping the league tables where almost two in three men and 57 per cent or women are single			1
but anyone looking for love in @entity19 is going to struggle , because just a quarter of men and fewer than a fifth of women are on the market			0
the @entity25 has published an interactive map showing the areas where all the single men , and women , live			1
scroll down for interactive map the @entity25 released a interactive series of maps showing where single people live , including this one which shows the percentage of those aged 16 and over who were not living as a couple in 2011 in 2011 over 15.7 million adults or 35 per cent of people aged 16 and over @entity42 and @entity43 had never been married , a rise from 12.5 million ( 30 per cent ) in 2001			1
including people who have been married before but are now divorced or widowed , the total number of singletons hit 23 million in 2011			1
this equates to 51 per cent of the population , outnumbering those in couples for the first time			0
in 2001 there were 19.4 million people classed as ‘ not married ’ , 47 per cent			1
the @entity25 said : ‘ the rise in the single population could be the result of a number of factors , including the proportional decline in marriage since the 1970s and the increased social acceptability of remaining single or cohabiting ( either never marrying or not re-marrying following divorce or widowhood )			1
’ people who live near the seaside may be more prone to divorce , a new report suggests			0
the divorce hot spots of @entity42 and @entity43 are all coastal areas , according to the @entity25			1
the local authority with the highest proportion of divorcees was @entity73 where 13.1 per cent of the population were divorced			0
in @entity76 12.8 per cent of people were divorced while 12.2 per cent of those in @entity78 had been through a marriage breakdown			0
@entity80 and @entity81 , @entity82 , the @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 also made up the top 10 places with the highest proportions of divorced people			0
' the top 10 were all in coastal areas , and mainly on the @entity94 of @entity42 apart from @entity73 and @entity86 , ' the report states			0
' higher levels of divorced population may relate to the affordability of housing and living costs in some of these areas resulting in divorced people with reduced economic assets living there			0
' the single population is also ageing , in part as a result of more older people being divorced and widowed			0
in 2011 , the median age of the adult population who had never been married was 27.5 , a rise from 26.9 in 2001			0
those who were not married in 2011 had a median age of 35.6 , a rise from 35.0 in 2001			0
of those who had never been married , women were younger than men , with a median age of 26.9 compared with 28 years			2
the @entity25 said : ‘ this is linked to the trend for women to marry men who are older than @entity122 , not married women were on average older than men ( 39.3 and 32.9 years respectively )			1
this is most likely due to the higher proportion of widows in the population ( 10 per cent of adult women compared with 3.3 per cent of adult men )			2
’ @entity12 in @entity131 has the highest proportion of single men ( 63 per cent ) , followed by @entity134 ( 61 per cent ) and @entity135 ( 60 per cent )			1
in @entity140 , @entity136 and @entity137 and @entity138 59 per cent of men were classed as single			2
by contrast , just 24 per cent of men in @entity19 were single , with 27 per cent single in @entity144 , @entity19 and @entity145 in the @entity146			1
@entity12 is also the capital of single women , with 57 per cent unattached , ahead of @entity134 on 56 per cent and @entity135 55 per cent			1
in @entity136 and @entity137 , @entity148 and @entity149 , 53 per cent of women were single			2
but in @entity152 just 18 per cent of women were single , followed by @entity153 ( 20 per cent ) and several areas where only 21 per cent were single			1
‘ the majority of the top 10 local authorities with the highest proportions of those who were either never married or unmarried were in @entity131 , ’ the @entity25 said			1
‘ local authorities with high proportions of single people had younger populations			0
@entity165 , for example , appeared in the top 10 for both groups			0
‘ the area with the lowest proportion of both never married and not married was @entity152 where 21 % of the adult population had never been married and a further 18 % were divorced or widowed			1
‘ this reflects the older age structure in this area and higher proportions of the population who were widowed			0
’ while the top 10 for men and women were dominated by the same areas , in some parts of the country there were marked differences			0
in @entity153 in @entity184 there were 21 men to every 10 women who had never been married			2
in the small village of @entity189 in @entity153 , there were 97 men to every 10 women – because it has a large army barracks in the area			0
there were more women than men who were not married in coastal areas such as @entity198 ( @entity199 ) and @entity200 ( @entity201 ) where there were around 13 women who were not married to every 10 men who were not married			2
the @entity25 added : ‘ these coastal areas have an older population and as women have higher life expectancy , this is likely to be due to the number of widows in the population			1

in @entity152 just 18 % of women and only 24 per cent of men are unattached , according to the @entity220
