letters show how ' shaky ' @entity2 's hold on power was at times and how unpopular the @entity5 became among the @entity7 masses letters written by ordinary germans to @entity2 during the dark days of @entity10 have been discovered in a @entity12 archive			1
the fascinating correspondence , which will surprise many with their critical tone , begins in 1924 and goes right through to the @entity16 ’s last days as he cowered in a @entity18 bunker in 1945			1
the documents , which were found in a @entity12 archive , have now been translated into @entity21 and reveal a side of the @entity23 that is rarely considered			1
support : @entity25 of @entity26 wrote this letter to @entity2 thanking him for the integration of @entity29 into the greater @entity30			1
his letter is among those recently found in a @entity12 archive and which are now published in a new book fan mail : a decorative telegram to @entity2 declaring ' loyalty and love ' sent in 1937 from a dr @entity40 tribute : @entity42 composed the ' @entity43 , @entity43 ' march for his beloved @entity16 they show how the popularity of @entity2 's @entity48 party was carefully managed as support grew among the @entity7 population - and beyond			1
but , more surprisingly , the letters also show how ' shaky ' @entity2 ’s hold on power was at times and how unpopular the @entity5 became among the masses			1
his office even received , and replied to , letters from @entity58 complaining about his party 's increasingly anti-semitic stance			2
chillingly , the @entity62 editor of a book publishing the correspondence , letter to @entity2 , claims the collection shows how a similarly totalitarian regime could emerge today			1
dr @entity68 said : ' some letters from people who idolise him are totally fawning , but you get the impression from the others that he could easily lose his approval			0
' the biggest lesson i learned was how shaky his popularity was and how the regime had to work hard to maintain popularity			0
' what is chilling is that you can see how he built his support and how you could see it happening elsewhere			0
' @entity87 wrote this @entity89 card for @entity2			2
' unutterably great thanks to @entity2 's parents for giving birth to our @entity16 ' , she gushed young admirers : @entity95 and @entity96 from the @entity97 thank @entity2 for having ' freed us and brought us into your beautiful @entity99 ' document : an eulogy from the @entity104 works of @entity105 in praise of the @entity16 the @entity23 carefully filed all the letters that their leader received , copied the replies and filed those as well			1
the letters grew in number through the 1930s as the @entity114 became more powerful , and include thousands wishing @entity2 a happy birthday			1
the correspondence includes letters from @entity58 unhappy with his policies , and from others pointing out to @entity2 what he ought to be doing			1
from mrs von @entity122 in 1930 as early as 1925 the direction of the @entity114 was being questioned , especially its lack of religious revival			0
@entity2 ’s deputy @entity126 responded to one such enquiry by stating that religious revival was not among the goals of the @entity114			2
@entity126 replied to another correspondent in 1925 who asked whether @entity2 drank			2
the reply was : ' mr @entity2 does not drink alcohol , except perhaps a few drops on very exceptional occasions			2
he does not smoke at all			0
' support for anti-semitic policies was received from a mrs von @entity122 in 1930			0
she wrote : ' in order to do completely jew - free work , we must require our members to agree not to buy from @entity58 , in this way we can gradually succeed in driving @entity58 out of retailing and thus put the middle - class back in the saddle			0
' international appeal : a bizarre book from the @entity29 of @entity148 declaring their approval of @entity2 @entity151 mayor @entity150 sent his best to @entity2 for the @entity153 in the form of a medieval manuscript awed : @entity156 wrote a poem to @entity2 worrying that he worked too hard the letters also show how well @entity2 ’s book @entity159 was doing , and in 1932 his publisher wrote to him : ' between the beginning of this year and 21 may we have been able to sell a total of 29,385 copies of your work			1
therefore we are crediting you with a payment of 21,157.20 marks ... ' another writer wanted permission to market ' @entity171 ' , but the offer was declined			0
one letter from a jew showed how integrated into @entity7 society they were and how the discrimination surprised them			2
@entity179 wrote : ' but what i can not say i am satisfied with is the one - sided treatment of thousands of my co-religionists , whose feeling and thinking are just as @entity7 as mine			2
' how much i should like to help build up my beloved @entity185 , if only an opportunity to do so were offered me			0
' in 1934 , as @entity2 built up a head of steam , the fawning letters grew in number and included this from @entity192 , who wrote : ' i am prepared , like my father , even to sacrifice my life , when @entity10 is involved and you , my leader , call			1
' as war approached , correspondents kept asking for peace			0
in 1938 , @entity201 and @entity202 wrote : ' it makes us happy and glad to know that peace exists and will remain			0
' treasure trove : the box in the @entity12 archives that contained the @entity2 correspondence the correspondence has been gathered in new book letters to @entity2 as the @entity5 headed to its conclusion many wrote to @entity2 with ideas for new weapons , but the letters asking for autographs and showing declarations of support fell to zero			1
but some remained faithful unto the end , like @entity221 , who wrote : ' but it may be granted to your prudent , temporising leadership , as we all confidently hope it will , at the right moment , with fullest health , to put a compelling halt to the enemy who has penetrated so far into @entity7 lands in the @entity232 and the @entity233			2
' dr @entity234 : ' through the 1930s the letters grow in number and @entity2 received many before the elections in 1933			1
and he got thousands on his birthday			0
' the high point was in 1938 and then the numbers of letters dropped off quite suddenly when the war started in 1939			0
' in the 1930s , the letters show veneration and excitement but also strongly - worded criticism			1
' people wrote to complain about specific aspects of his policies			0
in 1934 , he received a letter from a @entity58 who was not practising , but still had the confidence to write			0
' surprisingly those who complained often received feedback and it is clear that the regime realised the importance of popularity			0
' @entity2 said that popularity was the most important aspect of authority and by replying to the letters the regime was giving the illusion of paying attention			1
' and the longer the war went on the more they needed to enhance their popularity			0
' it is also clear what a strategic error it was to start the war because the people saw @entity2 as someone to bring peace and they did n’t want to go to war			2
' and they did feel able to write to @entity2 about it and the letters were carefully filed away and copies of replies that were sent were filed alongside the letters			1
' there is even one objecting to a relative being sent to @entity289			0
