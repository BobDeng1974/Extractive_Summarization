the university is to take legal action to challenge the @entity7 's decision to revoke its licence the university was condemned as ' very seriously deficient ' at ensuring its students do not become illegal immigrants , but last night it promised it would ' defend its reputation '			1
in a statement , the university said : ' @entity5 has tonight instructed its lawyers @entity36 to commence urgent legal action to challenge the revocation of its highly trusted status for sponsoring international students , so that its students can return to study as a matter of urgency			2
' following the leak of the @entity7 's decision eight days ago which " announced " the revocation , the university has now had the opportunity to read the report			2
' working with its advisers , the university has conducted a thorough review of @entity7 's " evidence " , and in the strongest possible terms challenges the outcome			2
' the move to revoke @entity5 of its licence could cost the institution up to £ 30million a year , it said			0
the university indicated that it would announce more details of the legal action later this week			0
uncertain future : up to 2,600 foreign students are affected by the @entity7 's decision , which their university is to challenge but it said that there was ' no evidence of systemic failings ' at the university , and that the evidence it had given to @entity7 showed it was taking every reasonable measure to be compliant with their rules			1

the statement added : ' @entity7 's requirements have changed substantially at least 14 times in the last three years			0
' we believe the university 's approach to complying with this multitude of changes is of a standard that not only equates with practices adopted by the majority of other universities in the sector but in a number of key areas exceeds sector - wide practice			0
' costly : @entity5 could lose £ 30million a year as a result of the revocation of its licence it continued : ' the @entity20 has a long - standing reputation of educational excellence and for attracting genuine students from a diverse international market			2
' it is not in anyone 's interests for there to be a system in place which constantly changes and which forces universities , their management and their staff automatically to treat students with suspicion until proven otherwise			0
' @entity5 is concerned that the current immigration policy is creating confusion across universities in the country and irrevocable damage to the @entity20 's globally - recognised education sector			2
' @entity5 appreciates that as the first @entity20 university to be placed in this position it has a duty to the sector to try and bring an end to the damage arising from @entity7 's decision			1
