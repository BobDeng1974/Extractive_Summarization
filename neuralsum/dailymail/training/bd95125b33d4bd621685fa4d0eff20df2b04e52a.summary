by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:54 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 07:53 est , 4 december 2013 no matter how you dress them up , @entity3 sprouts are one @entity7 tradition that many children could do without			2
over the years , attempts have been made to improve the flavour , adding sweet glazes , chestnuts or pieces of smoked bacon , but in many , many cases to no avail			0
now @entity17 has worked with growers in @entity19 and @entity20 to develop two varieties that they insist are ‘ kid - friendly ’			1
@entity23 , four , says he likes these @entity3 sprouts , but not ' the yukky ones @entity24 makes ' according to scientists , children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout - reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct , as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste , just like sprouts the kid - friendly sprout , which has a nuttier , sweeter taste , hits @entity17 shelves next week for a limited period , and it is hoped that children themselves will be piling them into the parental shopping trolley importantly , they have a milder and less bitter taste , making each mouthful a sweeter experience			1
the poor little sprout is often rejected by people both little and large alike due to its perceived bitter taste , so the supermarket giant has worked secretly with its farmers over the past year to create a milder flavour sprout that is low on bitterness and high on sweetness			2
the @entity17 ' kid - friendly ' sprout will arrive in branches this week for a limited period in the run up to @entity7			1
@entity57 according to scientists , children are not just being fussy when it comes to the knobbly sprout			2
reluctance to wolf them down stems from survival instinct , as harmful toxins tend to have a bitter taste , just like sprouts			1
sweetness , on the other hand , usually indicates that something is safe to eat , which is why children adore biscuits , cakes and @entity72			0
but there is a good reason why parents ought to urge their little poppets to eat @entity3 sprouts : they have twice as much vitamin c per 100g than oranges do , approximately 115mg as opposed to 54mg			0
@entity80 , chief @entity81 at @entity17 says : ' the humble @entity3 sprout is a wonderful bundle of deliciousness , but so often overlooked by children or picky eaters			1
' we have worked hard over the past year to develop this sprout which we believe will win over even the most ardent sprout haters			2
we hope it will get a massive thumbs up from children this @entity7 and encourage them to " eat their greens "			0
' @entity23 , age four , said : ' i like these sprouts			0
i do n't like the yucky ones my @entity24 cooks			0
' over the course of the sprout season @entity17 will sell approximately 15 varieties of sprouts , including the flower sprout and red sprout			1
sprouts are at their best now and this dish is packed with festive flavour			0
serves 8 ingredients method boil the sprouts for three minutes until starting to soften slightly , then drain			0
@entity109 the pancetta until crisp , then remove from the pan and set aside			0
add the chestnuts and sugar , tossing in the pan , then add the stock and reduce by half			0
add the sprouts and pancetta back to the pan and warm through to serve			0
@entity3 sprouts sales are booming and prices are falling , which means the traditional festive favourite is set for a revival this year , new industry figures show			1
better weather this season has led to a bumper crop of the vegetables that children love to hate at @entity7 , which means better supplies , lower prices and bigger sales , it reveals			1
year - on - year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value , said analysts @entity138 , looking at the most recent trading period covering 12 weeks to mid november			1
better weather this season has led to a bumper crop of the vegetables that children love to hate at @entity7 , which means better supplies , lower prices and bigger sales this is a major recovery on the same time last year when bad weather had led to a failed crop which in turn saw prices rise just as households were cutting budgets			1
but this year 's glut , after warmer , drier , weather means prices are coming down in time for @entity7			1
the average price of sprouts from the suppliers to the shops has come down from £ 3.88 a kilo a year ago to £ 3.59 a kilo last month , said @entity138 in the trade journal @entity165			2
this may not seem a big fall but at a time when many food and drink products are rising in price , it will be welcomed by shoppers more used to price rises than falls			0
and supermarkets are expected to use the falling price in their own special deals to entice @entity7 shoppers			0
year - on - year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value , said analysts @entity138 , looking at the most recent trading period covering 12 weeks to mid november @entity182 of commercial suppliers @entity184 told @entity165 : ' we have seen an increase in promotional activity versus the same period last year and also some deflation which has helped to push volume			1
' @entity190 of suppliers @entity191 added : ' unless this changes as we move into the peak season , sales should continue on this trajectory			2
' the good news comes as the humble sprout itself is changing with innovations including a sweeter version to tempt children , an @entity202 sprout / kale hybrid and a sprout flavoured @entity7 cake from @entity206 .			2

new sprouts are nuttier and sweeter than standard variety
it is thought children *dislike* sprouts because they are bitter
survival instinct *dictates* that bitter things are toxic and should n't be eaten
two ' kid - friendly ' varieties available for a limited time only in @entity17
@entity223 sprout - growing weather this season has encouraged growth
bumper crop means lower prices and booming sales
year - on - year sales are up 23 per cent by volume and 18.5 per cent by value
