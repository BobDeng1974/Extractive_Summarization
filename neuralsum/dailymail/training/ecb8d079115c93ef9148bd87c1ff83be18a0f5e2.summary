disgruntled : landlord @entity0 , 83 , took a tree vendor to court for selling trees before december 1 it seems the @entity6 cheer is n't here quite yet			1
a real estate mogul has taken a @entity6 tree vendor to court for selling trees on the sidewalk outside his @entity13 building before december 1			1
landlord @entity0 , 83 , griped that @entity15 started selling trees outside his building on 15th street and @entity18 on november 24 - hogging parking spots and clogging up foot traffic			1
but when the @entity22 - based company did not take down its stand , @entity0 took them to court to enforce a city code that prohibits the sale of trees before december 1			1
' unless the @entity15 is immediately stopped , defendants will continue to mount @entity6 trees on the stand , making removal of the trees extremely difficult , ' he said in the suit , which was reported in the @entity34			0
@entity0 , who lives on @entity35 , did not return a request for comment but @entity0 's attorney said his client brought the suit after complaints from residents in the building at 77 west 15th street			1
he added that the christmas tree company needs the landlord 's permission to sell its wares in front of his building			0
the suit was withdrawn on wednesday because the owners of the stand could not be tracked down to defend their business , but the landlord vowed to fight them again next year , the @entity34 reported			0
scene : he said that residents at his building on 15th street and @entity18 in @entity13 , pictured , had complained that the vendor was taking up parking spots and blocking the sidewalk @entity0 , who has multiple properties across @entity35 and in @entity62 according to records , served in advisory positions under @entity66 mayors @entity65 and @entity67			1
the code he referenced states that @entity6 trees must only be sold on the streets from december 1			2
it arose in 1938 , when then - mayor @entity71 demanded street vendors have a license			0
many were immigrants and the paperwork was often impossible to get through			0
but when members of the public complained that they could not buy @entity6 trees on the streets anymore , the @entity76 passed a law - the ' coniferous tree ' exception			0
the case was eventually thrown out because the vendor of the stand ( file pictured ) could not be found it says ' storekeepers and peddlers may sell and display coniferous trees during the month of december ' on a city sidewalk without a permit			2
the only issue for @entity15 is that the code states that vendor must also get the permission of the owners fronting the sidewalk - in this case the landlord - and keep a walkway open for pedestrians .			2

@entity0 , 83 , has taken @entity15 to court for blocking up the sidewalk outside his building on 15th street after his tenants complained
but the lawsuit was thrown out after the vendors could not be located
@entity0 was *hoping* to enforce a city rule that prohibits the sale of trees without a license before december 1
even after december 1 , vendors must get permission from *nearby* buildings
