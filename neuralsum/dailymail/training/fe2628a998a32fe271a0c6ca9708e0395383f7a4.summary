‘ welcome to the @entity0 in @entity1 ’			1
phew ! @entity2 done , mr @entity3			1
i suppose if you were going to get it wrong , then the dress rehearsal in @entity6 was the best place			1
yes indeed , @entity10 had made their way from @entity12 to bring us the opening salvos of @entity1 2014			1
and right away , they set quite the challenge for their @entity17 counterparts			1
the opening title sequence was an absolute beauty ( ‘ our director ’s been working on it most of his life ’ , said @entity31 ) , with its cool samba version of the evergreen standard ‘ @entity1 ’ and famous @entity0 scenes recreated by @entity22 on the street and on the beach			1
alright on the night : @entity3 made a fine job of his opening credits in @entity1 special guest : @entity0 winning @entity36 @entity35 joined @entity10 as a studio pundit all - star cast : @entity39 , @entity35 and @entity40 offered expert opinion on the @entity0 opener for @entity10 on the beach : @entity44 was given an even more luxurious location to report from speaking of sun - kissed sands , it certainly looks like @entity44 has found his spiritual home on the @entity49			1
he was having just way too much fun on there with his mate , the cameraman ‘ @entity55 ’ , as @entity54 called him			1
it was the old @entity58 front man ’s job to set the scene , which he managed to do whilst also name dropping ‘ my dear friend @entity63 ’ and accosting a surprised young @entity61 surfer called @entity62			1
who thirty seconds later was @entity54 ’s new dear friend ‘ @entity64 ’			1
this sense of joie de vivre also made it into the opening ceremony in @entity69 - finally			2
once the giant salad buffet made way for the dancers and the drummers , there was at last a sense of occasion rising up from the stadium			2
tragically though , that atmosphere did n’t make its way to our tellies when the big finale came			2
that was a five minute horror show			2
local star @entity84 and top drawer import @entity85 teamed up for the @entity0 song ‘ @entity88 ’			1
but the sound was virtually non existent for the audience at home			1
and the close ups were ruined by what sound there was being out of sync with the pictures			1
as the stars left the field , a barely whelmed @entity98 informed us ‘ there ’ll be a closing ceremony in 31 days from now ’			2
which at that precise moment , seemed much too close for comfort ! you had to be there : the atmosphere at the opening ceremony did n't transmit well xxxx star of the show : @entity113 was hired to add some extra glamour to the opening ceremony off key : @entity85 's performance was hampered by poor sound quality and syncing problems best of friends : @entity122 and @entity123 got on very well as they reported from the stadium back in the @entity10 studio , and @entity31 was equally as crestfallen as @entity98 had seemed			1
but that was because @entity122 had the plum job of interviewing @entity123 in the stadium			2
and got a big hug from the former @entity1 captain in the process			2
‘ wow , a pat on the back from @entity123 ’ , said @entity3			2
then looking to his right at the indefatigable @entity40 , told him ‘ i ’ve been waiting two years for one of them from you ’			2
@entity40 smiled broadly , but did n’t twitch			2
‘ no ? ’ , sighed @entity31			0
mind you , worse was to come			0
@entity10 ’s other special opening night guest was @entity35			1
and he spoke wistfully of @entity141 and how he had been there as a ball boy to see his hero score - ‘ @entity145 ’ ! no justice is there , @entity31			0
someone clearly happy to be there is @entity150			0
@entity151 are screening a series of live preview and review shows on site			0
@entity150 was sat on a veranda above the @entity49			0
there was a cooling breeze gently ruffing his quiff			0
and the presenter opposite him , @entity160 , was in a suit and @entity1 t shirt			0
be honest , @entity150 , @entity164 more like it than @entity166 , eh ? but life is n’t all a beach			1
there was the small matter of a tournament to get under way			0
which happened straight after a symbolic gesture of peace in @entity69			0
‘ nothing like a @entity178 congress for bright ideas ’ tut tutted @entity98			0
then , as we saw the three birds of peace rise into the air he muttered just under his breath ‘ the doves from above ’			0
@entity186 will have approved , @entity98			0
indeed , they may have been scrabbling around in their front rooms for a notepad when , in the second half , he was chatting about the new @entity0 ball			0
“ the one they used in the last tournament was roundly criticised ’ , he told us			0
keep that one in the act , @entity98			0
colourful : locals showed up in their numbers to cheer @entity1 on to victory against @entity200 excitement : there was plenty of carnival atmosphere among the home crowd not everything was a laughing matter , though , we were to discover			0
because at the end of the game and on the return to the studio , a shot of the beach that we had last seen empty as everyone left to to watch the game , was now busy with a protest			1
‘ @entity221 ’ read one of the banners as @entity3 explained people had been gathering for about ten minutes when they ‘ heard sharp , clattering sounds ’			0
at which point the studio camera picked out cracks in the window from stones thrown from the below			1
thankfully no one in the studio was hurt			1
indeed , our plucky host was clearly determined not to let the incident ruin the mood			0
because for no apparent reason at all , he wrapped coverage of the first game of the @entity0 in @entity1 with a clip of elephants playing football in @entity238			0
‘ you will see a hell of a defensive wall there ’ , he chuckled			0
you might want to have a word with @entity98 about some material , @entity31 ? animosity : as the sun went down a more sinister side to the @entity0 was highlighted on the beach tension : @entity22 protesters lined the beach and were visible in the background of the @entity10 studio			1

@entity10 open @entity253 in good style and lay down *gauntlet* to @entity17 rivals
@entity85 's performance is a damp *squib* *due* to sound *difficulties*
@entity22 protests on beach behind studio *overshadow* end of *programme*
