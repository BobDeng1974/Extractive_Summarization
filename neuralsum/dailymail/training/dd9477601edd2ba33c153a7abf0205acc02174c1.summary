by @entity0 published : 10:34 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 15 march 2013 @entity1 of @entity2 and her cousin @entity3 have never been one to rock the boat when it comes to their wardrobe choices			1
despite her style icon status @entity8 is actually a rather conservative dresser for a woman of her age , while sporty @entity3 is more at home in jodhpurs and a fleece than a glamorous dress			2
this week the two girls and @entity8 's younger sister @entity18 attended the chilly @entity20 racing meet in a selection of smart and stylish winter coats from designers including @entity24 and @entity25			2
so far , so good ( if a little sensible )			0
but underneath the elegant double - breasted coats style - watchers were horrified to spot one of fashion 's biggest fashion faux - pas on display : frumpy brown tights			1
the @entity8 in a salmon pink coat and brown tights @entity3 in a belted navy jacket , heeled brogues and brown tights @entity18 in yellow @entity25 and brown tights bafflingly each of the women had chosen to finish their various @entity20 outfits with the chocolate - coloured style no - no. for most grown women , brown opaque tights are a vague memory associated with bad @entity46 outfits , but here are three of the country 's most photographed women striding confidently around the @entity51 countryside as though cladding your legs in cocoa - coloured 60 deniers is the most normal thing in the world			1
31 - year - old @entity8 arrived at the course today with husband @entity58 wearing a peachy pink @entity61 coat teamed with head - to - toe brown accessories			2
her hat was a £ 240 @entity65 style from milliners @entity67 , the boots a pair of @entity71 suede knee - highs			2
even her gloves and clutch bag matched			0
31 - year - old @entity8 arrived at the course today with husband @entity58 wearing a peachy pink coat teamed with head - to - toe brown accessories and on @entity78 yesterday , both @entity3 and @entity18 chose to show off hazel - hued legs underneath their winter coats			1
the queen 's granddaughter @entity3 teamed hers with a navy funnel - necked coat , sensible shoes and a khaki - coloured hat by @entity88			0
the 31 - year - old 's @entity90 sunglasses were the only nod to current fashion trends			0
meanwhile 29 - year - old @entity18 set out to dazzle her eligible racing date @entity95 in a bespoke bright yellow coat by @entity97 designer @entity25			0
but finishing the look with brown tights , brown knee - high boots and a cocoa - coloured @entity102 hat gave the overall look an unfortunate ' bananagirl ' effect			1
@entity3 chose brown tights to finish off her @entity78 outfit yesterday , brightening the muted look up with a cute giraffe print clutch on day one and two of the racing meet the queen 's granddaughter styled her winter coats with light brown tights			1
@entity116 , and black tights , right in fashion terms , they say that three 's a trend , and the freezing temperatures at @entity123 have meant practical outfits all round , but will the the royal seal of approval make chestnut hosiery appropriate outer wear for the masses ? @entity130 , editor of the @entity133 's @entity132 section hopes not			2
she says : ' you can see how it happened			0
@entity137 brown boots are n’t an easy shoe to accessorise			0
' black tights look too , well , black ; sheer have too much sheen ; navy invoke memories of the school librarian … but brown ? ' as every style maven knows , brown tights are the least stylish hosiery known to womankind , rendering skinny pins twig - like and leaving larger legs looking similar to tree trunks			1
' so what could the royals have worn instead ? it ’s a tough one , but if the weather is too cold for bare legs ( which would be my preference with that footwear ) , i ’d plump for something matt black , preferably with a high denier ( so one over 70 )			0
' @entity8 may have single - handedly ( inexplicably ) brought flesh - coloured " nude " tights back from the fashion graveyard last year , but she should abandon all hope she ’s going to do the same for brown ones			0
' banana girl : 29 - year - old @entity18 set out to dazzle her eligble racing date @entity95 in a bespoke bright yellow coat by @entity97 designer @entity25 @entity8 recycled a @entity171 hat with bow detail for day four @entity18 wore a fur @entity102 style hat and huge sunglasses for @entity78 @entity3 chose a velvet @entity178 hat featuring @entity180 crystals for day one she wore a modern pillbox finished with a bright peacock feather for day two for @entity78 the royal wore a khaki design by @entity88 and designer sunglasses			1

@entity1 of @entity2 recycled a @entity61 jacket and @entity71 boots for day four of @entity20
chose *patterned* brown tights to finish off her outfit
@entity18 and @entity3 both chose chocolate hosiery on @entity78
style *experts* pray this does *n't* mean a ' fashion moment ' for frumpy tights
