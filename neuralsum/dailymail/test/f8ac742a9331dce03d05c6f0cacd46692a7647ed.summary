@entity0 was on the verge of pulling out of his must - win bout in the @entity3 before opting to fight and claiming a dramatic win to book his place at the @entity6 alongside team - mate @entity7			1
both @entity9 boxers ( bronze medallists at @entity11 ) , were in action for the @entity14 franchise in @entity15 on saturday night , with the pair needing victories to book flights to @entity6			2
@entity7 delivered in style , extending his undefeated @entity3 record this season to 7 - 0 with a split - decision points win over native light - flyweight @entity23			1
@entity0 has booked his @entity26 place after results went his way in @entity15 on saturday night the two - time @entity26 medallist dropped his opponent in the first round en route to claiming a 49 - 45 victory on two of the judges ’ cards while the remaining judge questionably scored the fight 48 - 47 in @entity23 ’s favour			1
the spilt - decision win was enough to help @entity7 top the 49kg @entity3 rankings , with the @entity43 native leapfrogging @entity45 ’s @entity44 to claim the only @entity26 qualification spot on offer through the competition			1
@entity50 ’s mission was a far more complex affair , however			2
not only did the @entity53 fighter need to win — which he did , earning a 49 - 46 unanimous points win over @entity15 opponent @entity56 — but he also had to rely on a shock result elsewhere			1
the 23 - year - old leapt to no 2 in the @entity3 bantamweight rankings , claiming the second 56kg @entity26 spot on offer thanks to his win and the fact that @entity65 ’s @entity64 lost to @entity66 in @entity67			2
@entity66 had @entity64 down in the fifth and final round of their bout as the @entity67 became a cult hero for @entity73 boxing , akin to @entity75 footballer @entity74 who booked a place at @entity77 ’ 88 for @entity79 ’s @entity73 side thanks to a goal against @entity81			0
the domino effect left @entity0 in shock			1
the @entity9 bantamweight was close to pulling out in frustration at his qualification limbo , and had all but made up his mind to turn professional in the near future before a dramatic u-turn			0
@entity0 ’s brother , @entity90 , himself a promising professional boxer , was just one of the confidantes who contacted him to convince him to fight			1
coaches @entity92 and @entity94 ( @entity0 ’s father ) also played key roles in helping the boxer into the ring , continuing their sterling efforts throughout the competition			1
both @entity0 and @entity7 won bronze at @entity11 , and will now represent @entity73 again in @entity6 ‘ it has n’t sunk it yet			1
i could n’t believe it			0
i was n’t really up for it [ the fight ] at all because i did n’t think the @entity65 would lose , ’ said @entity0 , speaking exclusively to @entity101			1
‘ i was thinking about pulling out [ on friday ]			0
if i had ’ve pulled out i would have been shattered now , lucky enough i did n’t			0
‘ if i had n’t have qualified , i would have turned professional			0
i could n’t be bothered going to [ qualify through ] the @entity107 after going through all of this			0
‘ when i got out of the ring , @entity7 ran over and jumped on me and shouted , “ you ’ve qualified ” and i said “ you ’re lying to me , stop lying to me ! ” i nearly felt like crying , i just could n’t believe it			2
’ @entity0 dedicated the result and his achievements to his girlfriend , @entity116 and four - week old daughter , @entity117			1
‘ i really wanted to qualify to have time with her and my kid			0
i ’ve been looking forward to doing the night feeds and all ! the main reason i ’ve done this is for her , i ’m just so happy it all paid off			0
’ @entity7 , meanwhile , has created history by becoming the first @entity73 boxer ever to qualify for three olympics			2
the 28 - year - old had battled his fear of flying throughout his @entity3 mission , with @entity7 and @entity0 travelling over 34,000 miles over the course of seven @entity3 bouts			1
the @entity134 champion now plans on taking an extended break until later in the year after an exhausting campaign which ended in glory			0
‘ i ’m over the moon , ca n’t get any better			0
i wo n’t even care about the flight because i know i ’ve done it now — i wo n’t be flying around the place any more anyway ! ’ he said			0
@entity7 , in quite colourful language , also told @entity101 that both he and @entity94 had to overcome upset stomachs to compete			2
despite that , the pair ’s glory run continues unabated .			0

@entity0 and @entity7 both win to reach @entity149 games
@entity0 won his fight but had to rely on other results to make it through
@entity155 dedicated his win to his girlfriend after fighting despite illness
