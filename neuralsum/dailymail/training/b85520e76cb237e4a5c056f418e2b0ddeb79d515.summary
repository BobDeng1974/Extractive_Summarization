@entity0 is adamant @entity2 ’s dreadful autumn form will not derail their ambitions of ending the season with a top four place			1
such has been the dramatic reversal in @entity2 ’s fortunes , @entity0 – who just six months ago was named the @entity9 – had to field questions yesterday on how he felt having his odds slashed by bookmakers in the ‘ sack race ’			1
this has been a testing period for @entity0			1
@entity2 have not won a game since october 28 in any competition and their struggles have left the @entity19 pacing his kitchen in the middle of the night , trying to find solutions to their problems			1
@entity0 was voted @entity9 last season , but has had a tough start to 2014/15 @entity2 sit 12th in the @entity27 , and have n't won a match in any competition since october 28 so managers can clam up in these types of situations but @entity0 , who will keep faith with under - fire no 1 @entity34 for today ’s @entity36 collision with @entity37 after holding a meeting with him at @entity39 , was relaxed as he discussed the shortcomings that have left @entity2 in twelfth place			1
more than anything , though , he was resolute in stating his that his side will claw back any lost ground and fulfil the aim of @entity46 , @entity2 ’s owners , and secure a place in next year ’s @entity49			1
for all that they have been wretched , their rivals have not pulled away			1
‘ i have an inherent belief that we can still make the top four – absolutely , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i know what we are all capable of here			1
for whatever reason , it has n’t happened for us yet but i said to the players the other night our standards will go up after the game against @entity62			2
‘ thankfully no matter how we have been , we are still within touching distance and that is the initial aim			2
@entity66 and then moving forward			2
if that is the aim – and we are only five points off it – then that gives me belief we have every chance of doing it			2
‘ i am not saying it is going to be easy or hard			2
we obviously have to pick up form but i saw enough encouragement from the group the other night that we are going to move forward and now is the time to do that			2
ludogorets scored a late equaliser through @entity79 to nick a surprise draw against @entity2 in the @entity49 on wednesday night - another disappointing result for @entity0 @entity0 watches on as @entity2 struggle to a draw against minnows @entity62 in the @entity49 ‘ if we put a run of results together then we have the experience from last year			1
the players went through it and did it then			2
i have every belief we can do it			2
sometimes things are never as bad as people say or write			2
they are not always as good as people say or write , either			0
‘ for me , stay calm			0
we will be better for sure and let that be seen on the field in their actions			0
i am satisfied that all i can do with what i have is the best i can possibly do			0
when you do that and put hours and hours into your work and study and manage to motivate players that makes you relaxed			0
’ he is also realistic			0
@entity0 recognises how capricious football can be and for all that he has the unequivocal backing of @entity46 ’s leading men , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , a couple of positive results are required to turn down the noise others are making about his future			1
‘ i know i will fight for my life to be here for as long as i can ; if there is a rocky spell then that is something you never like as a manager , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you never like seeing or hearing things like you are the bookies favourite to get the sack when six months ago i was @entity9			1
‘ but that is modern football			1
all i can do is my best and i will continue to do my best			0
while i do that , i will always be relaxed knowing that whenever that time comes from the owners , whether it is in a month or 10 years , i ’ll walk out of here having given my absolute all			0
i am happy with that			0
’ on sunday , @entity2 lost 3 - 1 to @entity135 at @entity136 - but @entity0 insists they can make top four @entity138 ( second left ) celebrates after scoring @entity135 's third in the rain at @entity136 on sunday one thing @entity0 has not lost through all this is his confidence			1
sir @entity143 revealed in his autobiography that his belief in his ability was rattled early in his career after enduring a month without winning but @entity0 has not lost sight of what he is trying to achieve			1
‘ i have faith in my methods and a way of working , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we have been given a different deck of cards and , as a coach , i have to do what i think gets the best out of them			0
i have methods , a belief and a philosophy but you also have to get results			0
i am not a fantasist			0
’ it will take time for them to find the sparkle of last year but not losing is the immediate priority and it remains to be seen whether @entity0 will reward @entity172 for an encouraging return to action in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity62 with his first @entity27 start since september 20			1
‘ i am 27 now and probably my best years are still to come , ’ said the @entity176 , whose long - term future is still uncertain			0
‘ of course i want to play			0
the day that i walk into @entity39 and feel ok about not playing ? that is not me			0
i am not the type of person who just wants to collect his money			0
it is not me and has never been me			0
of course i am not happy not to be playing			0
when you play , you feel that you can help the team and you feel better			0
