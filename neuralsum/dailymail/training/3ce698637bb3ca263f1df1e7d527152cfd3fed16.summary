huge roars greeted the @entity1 , with ' @entity3 ' roaring around the stadium for any sustained passing sequence by @entity7 's side			2
@entity8 were met with whistles and jeers and all around @entity11 there has been one refrain from the locals : ' anyone but @entity8			2
' on twitter , # todossomosalemanhes or ' we 're all @entity1 ' was trending in @entity19 and @entity20 complained that the team had been kept awake by fireworks until 4am			1
it seems some @entity19 would do anything rather than let this @entity26 finish in a further humiliation			2
there are no issues with who sings the @entity39 anthem or not - @entity47 limit anthem time to a minute and their anthem is so long , it does n't even reach the words within that allotted time			2
it does n't stop the fans singing along - in a dum - de - dum manner - and bouncing up and down the jauntier sections			2
the anthems : @entity19 fans let @entity8 sing before the game , albeit in a dum - de - dum manner the invasion has been truly overwhelming			1
all saturday tens of thousands @entity39 poured into @entity11 , the majority without tickets			0
the queues for the @entity63 was a few thousand strong hours before its opening and trains en route to @entity68 were literally rocking as @entity39 - from gnarled old hooligan leaders to 12 - year - old girls with flowers in their hair - running through their extensive repertoire of provocative songs as they bounced up and down , punching the walls with the equilibrium of the trains in constant jeopardy			1
fan fest : @entity8 fans dominate the @entity81 in @entity11 as tens of thousands poured in watching on : the queues for @entity63 was a few thousand strong hours before opening there were less @entity39 in the stadium at the final than at any other of their previous games , due to the scarcity of tickets			1
that said , there were enough to run through their usual chants , most of which were laughing at their @entity19 hosts			0
encouragingly @entity96 are n't yet considered a total irrelevance			0
the old favourite ' whoever does n't jump is an @entity96 ' has received numerous outings here			1
laughing : @entity8 seem happy enough that they made the final and their @entity19 counterparts did n't the list of vip guests for the final was impressive , including chancellor @entity106 , @entity108 president @entity107 and @entity19 president @entity109 along with supermodel @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
which only made it more perplexing that @entity118 was also included on the list of @entity120			0
clearly his time at @entity122 and @entity123 made an impression on @entity125			0
pals : @entity127 and @entity113 looked in high spirits ahead of the @entity37 final excited : @entity111 takes her seat during the closing ceremony for the final match of the @entity26 2014 chat : @entity47 president @entity125 talks with @entity108 president @entity107 ( left ) ahead of the @entity26 final excited : @entity112 ( centre ) and her partner @entity138 's @entity137 ( right ) smile at the @entity34 the closing ceremony was a kaleidoscope of colour , with samba bands , carnival queens and @entity112 and @entity144 performing			1
@entity144 had begun his press conference ' with a big shout out to my people in the favelas '			0
which was nice , though his ' people ' might have wanted to ask why he was performing for @entity47 , the organisation jointly responsible for @entity19 spending billions of pounds on useless football stadia rather than electricity and sanitation in the favelas			1
music : @entity159 ( left ) , @entity144 ( centre ) and @entity158 perform before the final there was no sign of any protest near the stadium - largely because key leaders involved in the demonstrations against the @entity26 were arrested the night before the final			1
in moves which their lawyers described as clear human rights abuses , police swooped on their address and detained them during the final			0
the police said that the detained leaders had been involved in violent protests in the past			0
prepared : hundreds of police officers gather outside the @entity34 for the @entity26 final @entity181 was the epitome of coolness and calm in the build up to the final and the @entity1 have been delightful and humble throughout the tournament			1
@entity181 even tweeted a photo playing basketball in a @entity19 shirt before the final , thanking the host for their hospitality			2
( though he neglected to add : ‘ especially for the semi-final debacle )			0
for the final though , @entity195 had reasserted an air of authority and some might say arrogance			0
his boots bore the inscription : ‘ @entity202			0
’ which made him sounds like someone in @entity206			0
' the chosen one ' : @entity29 's @entity181 gave off an air of authority - and arrogance proud : @entity181 has been the epitome of coolness and calm in the build up to the @entity26 final @entity216 : @entity181 gave everything against @entity8 in the final roar : @entity29 won the @entity26 with @entity181 leading by example at the @entity34			1

' we 're all @entity1 ' trends in @entity19 before and during @entity26 final 2014
@entity63 *swamped* by thousands of @entity8 fans hours before opening
' whoever does n't jump is an @entity96 ' has been a favourite chant in @entity11
vip guests included @entity108 president @entity107 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity115 and @entity47 president @entity125 to name a few
@entity144 performs at closing ceremony and dedicates it to ' my people ' - although they may ask why he performed for @entity47 in first place
@entity181 has ' @entity202 ' put on football boots
@entity29 win the @entity37 after 1 - 0 win @entity241 over @entity8
