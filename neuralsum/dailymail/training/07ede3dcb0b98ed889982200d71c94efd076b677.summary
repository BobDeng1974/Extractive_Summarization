air bags , mirrors and sensors can only do so much to prevent deaths as a result of a dangerous driving			0
now @entity6 has developed a technology that , it claims , could eliminate road fatalities in its cars by 2020			1
the @entity11 group claims that by the end of the decade , its next - generation cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360 - degree view of their surroundings			1
if an accident is likely , the system will allow the car to find an ‘ escape route ’ , brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash			1
the firm aims to end driving fatalities from @entity6 cars by 2020 this required the development of a centralised sensor fusion framework to enable the various technologies – cameras , radar and gps - to share information efficiently			1
if an accident is likely , the system will allow the car to find an ‘ escape route ’ , brake automatically or steer the car to avoid a crash			1
the system looks for pedestrians , cyclists , and other vehicles and anticipates their movements , in comparison to the car , five seconds in advance			1
an alert will be sent out if the driver is in danger of crashing			0
if the driver does n’t respond , the car will take over			2
the technology was developed by @entity6 ’s four - year @entity62 and @entity63 , which will be drawing to a close in december			1
the system looks for pedestrians , cyclists , and other vehicles and anticipates their movements in comparison to the car five seconds in advance			2
an alert will be sent out if the driver is in danger of crashing			0
if the driver does n’t respond , the car will take over ‘ we ’ve taken a significant step towards realising the vision that by 2020 no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new @entity6 car , ’ said @entity74 , project manager for the @entity75 at @entity6			1
‘ the technology is also imperative for the development of self - driving cars , which will be able to automatically steer and brake to avoid collision with any object in any situation			1
@entity87 uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre sending information to any @entity92 or @entity94 device using @entity95 @entity97 pressures can now be checked remotely with a simple monitor which sends alerts and updates directly to your mobile			0
@entity87 uses four sensors to monitor the pressure of each tyre , sending information to any @entity92 or @entity94 device using @entity95 4.0			0
the @entity105 - based team behind @entity87 say drivers can fit the sensors in less than five minutes by screwing them on top of each tyre valve			0
this enables readings to travel via @entity95 to both smartphones and the in - car unit			2
the gadget can then monitor up to 20 cars simultaneously and share readings with friends and family - a useful feature if one car has more than one driver			1
the entire set is also locked to a specific cloud account so any stolen pieces of equipment can not be reused			0
the gadget was put on crowdfunding website @entity127 on september 1 but it has already surpassed it ’s target of £ 17,500 ( $ 28,100 )			0
one @entity87 set comes with four tyre sensors , one in - car unit and a free @entity133 tyre app to be downloaded from the @entity134 or @entity135			2
the kit costs £ 91 ( $ 146 ) and will be ready for shipping in november			0
‘ our primary objective is to focus on preventing different types of accident scenarios			0
but going forward , we will also continue to work on developing cars that adapt to each individual driver ’s unique behaviour			2
’ according to @entity146 at @entity147 , the technology is similar to that used in @entity149 , but this system is only used to alert the driver rather than carry out severe avoidance manoeuvres			0
@entity153 today announced similar safety features on its new dual - motor sedan			1
the vehicle features a system that moves the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal			1
it will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly @entity153 today announced similar safety features on its new dual - motor sedan			1
the group 's @entity165 steers itself back if it wanders from its lane and brakes automatically if it is about to hit something , founder @entity164 said			0
these features are already offered on luxury competitors , as well as mainstream brands such as @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
but @entity153 is going a step further			0
its new system will move the car over a lane when the driver uses the turn signal			1
it will also use cameras to read speed limit signs and decelerate accordingly			0
mr @entity164 added that ' auto pilot ' does not mean that the car could drive itself - as he put it , a driver can not ' safely fall asleep			2
' although , he said , on private property - not public roads - a driver could summon the car remotely			2
the technology pictured was developed by @entity6 ’s four - year @entity62 and @entity63 , which will be drawing to a close in december			2

@entity6 claims its next - generation cars will be equipped with computers that have a 360 - degree view of surroundings
if an accident is likely , the car can find an *alternative* route , brake or steer
the technology also plans movements up to five seconds in advance
@entity6 said it hopes to eliminate all road fatalities in its cars by 2020
@entity153 today announced its *lastest* sedan will have a safety feature that will move car over a lane when the driver uses turn signal
