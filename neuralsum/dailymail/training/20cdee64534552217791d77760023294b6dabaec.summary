by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 11:48 est , 23 january 2013 a tiny deer weighing the same as a bag a sugar has been rescued from a back garden after being abandoned by its mother			1
the muntjac , appropriately named @entity9 because it was found in icy conditions , was discovered outside a home in @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14			1
the owner took the freezing fawn to a nearby wildlife centre and staff there have been looking after him ever since			2
snowflake is smaller than a cat and weighs just 2.2lb - about the same as a bag of sugar centre manager @entity24 feeds @entity9 some milk at @entity27 rescue unit in @entity28 , @entity14 it is believed the deer became separated from his mother shortly after birth and was too small to keep up with her			1
the man who found him said that he could hear the mother calling in the distance but thought it best to take the animal to the @entity41 and @entity42			2
the newborn deer was in shock and could have died as temperatures plunged below freezing in @entity47			1
snowflake the newborn muntjac deer had collapsed in the snow after getting separated from his mother @entity51 , from the animal rescue centre , said they would hand rear @entity9 until he is able to take care of himself			1
the deer will be released into the wild close to where he was found when he is five or six months old			2
ms @entity51 said : ' @entity9 was born in the snow			0
deer tend to give birth and then leave the fawn in the undergrowth and return to feed it			0
' we always say that if you find a fawn on its own then that 's normal			0
but this chap rang the @entity71 to say he had a deer in his garden and he was worried about it and had put a blanket on it			2
' ' we told him to remove the blanket , then he rang back and said he was still concerned and sent a photo which showed it had actually collapsed			0
' the little deer was in trouble and so we are assuming that his mother had just given birth because he is relatively newborn			1
it was a bit of a shock to the system to be dropped like that into the snow			0
' he just was n't strong enough to follow his mum into safety and now he 's been handled there 's no way she would take him back			0
' @entity9 's not strong enough to stand up yet - he only weighs a kilo and is smaller than a cat			0
' but he 's doing well and is being bottle - fed with a milk formula now and should be fine			0
' @entity9 was found in a residential garden in @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14 on sunday			1
