the current @entity1 outbreak in @entity2 could infect more than 20,000 people , the @entity4 has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease			1
the @entity8 health agency issued plans to combat the outbreak in four @entity2 nations - @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 - where it said the actual number of cases could already be two to four times higher than the reported 3,069			1
the current death toll stands at 1,552			1
the news comes as a new outbreak was confirmed in the @entity22 after a pregnant woman contracted the disease from infected bush meat and passed it on to health workers			1
the death toll in the @entity2 epidemic alone currently stands at 1,552 @entity35 : a group of young volunteers wear special uniforms for the burial of people in @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity13 earlier this week			1
the victims ' bodies are sterilized after dying from the virus describing plans to tackle the @entity2 outbreak , the @entity4 said : ' this roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two - four fold higher than that currently reported			1
' ' it acknowledges that the aggregate case load of @entity1 could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency , ' the agency added			0
the deadly @entity2 outbreak that began in @entity11 in march and has since spread to @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity15 , requires a massive and coordinated international response , the @entity4 said			1
' response activities must be adapted in areas of very intense transmission and particular attention must be given to stopping transmission in capital cities and major ports , thereby facilitating the larger response and relief effort , ' the @entity4 said			0
the virus is still being spread in a ' substantial number of localities ' , aggravating fragile social and economic conditions and has already killed an unprecedented number of health workers			1
today it was revealed that @entity15 has confirmed its first @entity1 death outside the city of @entity80 , with a doctor succumbing to the virus in the oil hub @entity84 last friday			2
a further 70 people are now under surveillance in the city , with the man 's wife among those that have been placed in quarantine			0
protection : the current @entity1 outbreak in @entity2 - which began in @entity11 ( pictured ) - could infect more than 20,000 people , the @entity4 has revealed in a bleak assessment of the deadly disease a woman washes her child with salted water in a suburb of the @entity102 capital @entity103			1
the woman was relying on a rumor that was spread in the area claiming that salted water helps to fight against the deadly virus a wider @entity8 - led plan being launched by the end of september is ' expected to underpin support for the increasingly acute problems associated with food security , protection , water , sanitation and hygiene , primary and secondary health care and education , as well as the longer - term recovery effort that will be needed , ' the @entity4 said in today 's report			2
a separate outbreak of @entity1 in @entity22 - identified as a different strain and thought to have started when a pregnant woman contracted the virus from infected bush meat - is not included in the @entity4 's forecast			1
an unnamed woman in the village of @entity129 in @entity22 's northern @entity130 is believed to have butchered an animal that had been captured and killed by her husband shortly before falling ill. the woman was subsequently transported to a private clinic in nearby @entity136 village for specialist care due to her pregnancy , but she subsequently died of a then - unidentified haemorrhagic fever			0
the @entity1 then infected and killed a number of the woman 's relatives and health care workers due to local customs and rituals carried out on her corpse that delayed her funeral by more than a week			2
infection zone : people stand on the shoreline near a sign reading ' no dumping ' , amongst rubbish at @entity154 - an area of the @entity14 capital @entity156 that is badly hit by the ebola virus lock down : local residents not allowed to leave the @entity154 area , as @entity14 government forces clamp down on movement to prevent the spread of @entity1 in the capital city @entity156 the @entity22 's @entity164 notified the @entity4 of the outbreak on tuesday , following the woman 's death on august 11			1
since then a number of her relatives and at least four health - care workers who were exposed to her corpse have died , and there a reports several others are seriously ill. in a report , @entity4 blamed ' local customs and rituals associated with death ' for delaying the woman 's burial and dramatically increasing the number of people coming into close contact with her body			1
between 28 july and 18 august this year , a total of 24 suspected cases of @entity1 have been identified in the @entity22 , leading to at least 13 deaths			0
it is @entity22 's seventh outbreak since the deadly hemorrhagic fever was discovered in 1976 in the same isolated northwestern jungle province in which the pregnant woman died			2
spread : nurses wearing protective suits enter a @entity14 village in order to search for a man suspected of being infected with the deadly ebola virus			0
the man was later taken to a hospital in @entity156 for treatment crucially , the strain currently infecting people in @entity22 is different to that which has already killed at least 1,427 people in @entity2 - which has somewhat allayed fears that the deadliest @entity1 outbreak in history could have somehow travelled thousands of miles to the continent 's centre			2
among the healthcare workers known to have died shortly after coming in to contact with the pregnant woman are one doctor and two nurses who performed her surgery , a male ward assistant , and a hygiene specialist working in the clinic			0
who said an unknown number of her relatives involved in ' local customs and rituals ' relating to her death have also now died , without expanding on what those practices might have been			0
a further 11 cases are being held in isolation centres suffering the suspected symptoms of the disease - which kills in the vast majority of cases - with tissue samples sent to laboratories in the @entity22 's capital @entity237 , and in neighbouring @entity238 for further analysis			0
in total it is believed at least 80 people came into close enough contact to contract the virus from the pregnant woman between the time of her infection and eventual burial			0
tragic : a @entity14 man in a truck looks down on another man believed to be dying from the ebola virus , in one of the main streets on the outskirts of the capital city @entity156 earlier this week in response to the outbreak , the @entity22 's @entity164 has dispatched teams of scientists and investigators to @entity130 in order to evaluate the situation there and work out how many other people may be at risk - either from human - to - human transmission or from infected bush meat			1
neither the deceased pregnant woman nor any of her 80 contacts have any history of travel to the areas of @entity2 currently hit by an alternative strain of @entity1			2
news of the @entity22 outbreak comes as @entity278 health officials prepared to announce that a human study of an @entity1 vaccine made by @entity281 will begin within a couple of weeks			2
the @entity283 , part of the @entity285 , will start the study no later than the end of the year , according to people familiar with the plans			0
in addition , a steering committee made up of senior officials from @entity285 and the @entity293 last week approved the first step toward using three advanced laboratories to manufacture @entity1 vaccines and treatments			0
the three labs , in @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 , were set up in 2012 by the @entity278 @entity302 in partnership with private industry to respond to pandemics or chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear threats			0
a @entity281 spokeswoman confirmed that the trial would begin but declined to specify when .			0

@entity4 delivers bleak assessment of @entity2 outbreak
