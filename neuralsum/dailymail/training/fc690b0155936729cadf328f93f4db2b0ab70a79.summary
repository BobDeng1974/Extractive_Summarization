by @entity0 and @entity1 intrusive new powers to spy on the last 12 months of everybody ’s bank statements are being demanded by the taxman			1
in a major escalation of its existing rights , @entity6 wants to be able to access monthly copies of bank , @entity11 and even joint account statements			1
this would mean sensitive personal details such as the size of families ’ monthly mortgage payments , how much they spend in restaurants and the amount saved into a tax - free nest egg are open to scrutiny			0
under the powers , @entity6 would examine spending levels for a year before raiding accounts for unpaid tax last night , critics condemned the unprecedented power grab as ‘ @entity29 ’ tactics			1
it is the latest twist in the furore over @entity6 ’s plans to take money directly from bank accounts to settle unpaid tax bills			1
at least 17,000 people a year will have funds seized under the proposed new powers			1
but yesterday @entity6 chief executive @entity39 went further , telling mps on the @entity41 she also wants to be able to ask banks or building societies to hand over 12 months of a person ’s bank or @entity11 statements			1
this is to check their income flow so officials can be sure the money will be there when they swoop on the account			2
ms @entity39 even suggested that if @entity6 is given the power , a ‘ debate will follow ’ about extending it to other public bodies such as retrieving money owed for tv licences or car tax			1
but she told mps she accepted there was a risk that @entity6 could make mistakes when targeting someone ’s finances			1
under the powers , @entity6 would contact people who owe money up to nine times and if they fail to respond their bank account would be frozen for 14 days			1
during this ‘ cooling off period ’ , tax officials want to have access to a year ’s worth of bank statements to assess whether the person can live on what money might be left if their taxes are taken from their account			1
@entity6 says it would leave £ 5,000 in accounts once the debts have been removed			1
@entity83 mp @entity82 said : ‘ this is another intrusion into people ’s lives			1
' you are going to have the power to get 12 months ’ bank accounts from people , building societies … the lot			1
’ @entity6 chief executive @entity39 insisted the powers were needed to target 17,000 ' recalcitrant debtors ' but @entity97 mp @entity96 said it was a ' unique right to go against the @entity100 charter ' the taxman fails to answer more than one in five phone calls			1
mps demanded ‘ resignations on the table ’ unless significant improvements were made			0
@entity6 admitted it would not be able to guarantee to answer 90 per cent of calls this year , as it brought in hundreds of extra staff to deal with peak periods			1
according to latest figures , in 2013 - 14 , the @entity6 answered just 79 per cent of calls to its call centres			1
@entity83 mp @entity82 said there must be improvements or there should be ‘ resignations on the table ’			0
he raged : ‘ it ’s no use trying			2
trying is not the word			0
either do it or go , that ’s quite straightforward			2
you are harming a tremendous amount of people			2
’ ms @entity39 insisted ‘ significant progress ’ was being made , but would like it to be ‘ much better ’			0
‘ it is one of the most important things we are doing			0
’ liberal democrat @entity96 led a chorus of criticism of the move			0
he said : ‘ we are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state ... to have the unique right to go against the @entity100 and all the other things we have established and to go in and seize – without judicial process or review – a bank account			2
' i just want to know if it is justified , because my sense is that @entity144 is going to reject it			0
’ mr @entity96 said that @entity6 was trying to become ' judge , jury and executioner ' and to remove legal protections from those who it believes owe tax , simply because it was ' slow and expensive ' to follow the legal processes			1
he demanded to know whether the taxman would pay compensation in full if it removed money from people 's bank accounts or @entity158 in error and their house purchase fell through or they missed out on a windfall from rising share prices as a result			1
but ms @entity39 insisted : ' i do n't think this is against @entity100			0
i do n't think it is substantially different from the @entity166 arrangement			0
' this is not disputed tax , this is tax that is due , that people who are not subject to @entity166 are choosing simply not to pay and they are creating an environment within which the normally very low collection cost of tax is made substantially higher by their action , in a way which in the vast majority of cases is wilful			2
' i believe that for the taxpayer as a whole , it is right that we have sufficient powers to stop these limited numbers of people avoiding paying tax			2
' more than 90 per cent of people pay their taxes , but a minority take the view that they will delay paying for as long as they can get away with it , said ms @entity39			1
' we are talking about 17,000 people who do n't dispute the tax is due , they just do n't pay , ' she said			1
' we will have written to them , we will have engaged with them and they just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action			0
' of course , we can go to court , but the cost both in time and money of going to court will often outweigh or seriously diminish the amount of tax collected			0
in these cases , we believe with proper safeguards ... this is a fairer way of extracting the tax everybody is due to pay			2
' the plan to take money directly from people ’s bank accounts was announced in the @entity216			1
but the proposal to scrutinise statements emerged only yesterday when @entity6 officials were questioned by mps on the @entity41			2
at present , the taxman is only allowed to know how much interest you have received from your bank accounts			1
last night , an @entity6 spokesman insisted the new information it is demanding would not be used for ‘ any purposes other than the direct recovery of debts ’			2
he said : ‘ we would immediately destroy the information once @entity232 [ direct recovery of debts ] has been applied			0
’ warning : @entity235 celebrities such as @entity235 , the @entity238 boss @entity237 and around 1,300 other people have been warned to prepare for tax demands of more than £ 520million			0
they have been caught up in a £ 7billion crackdown by the @entity41 that forces people to immediately pay disputed tax bills if they have used an alleged tax - avoidance scheme			2
@entity235 , mr @entity237 and other investors are , or have been , clients of @entity247 , an investment company that financed films			0
the firm says it is ‘ fundamentally unjust ’ to demand payment for tax bills before a tribunal , due to begin in november , takes place			0
' this goes against the @entity100 ' @entity6 ’s new powers will ‘ go against the @entity100 ’ by allowing it to seize money without needing the permission of the courts , an mp said yesterday			1
in the @entity100 , which will celebrate its 800th anniversary next year , @entity262 39 states : ‘ no free man shall be seized or imprisoned or stripped of his rights or possessions … nor will we proceed with force against him or send other to do so except by the lawful judgment of his equals , or by the law of land			0
’ lord @entity96 , a @entity97 mp , said : ‘ we are talking here about the ability for one organisation of state to go against the @entity100 and seize – without judicial process – a bank account			0
’ @entity6 says it wants to look at the bank statements in order to make sure that a person will not suffer hardship after the money is removed to pay the tax debt			1
it has promised all those targeted will be left with a minimum of £ 5,000 across their accounts after the tax debt has been paid			0
it will also not seek to ‘ create or increase overdrafts ’			0
mrs @entity39 told @entity289 that the people who will be targeted by the new money - grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax , but simply refuse			1
‘ they do n’t dispute that the tax is due , ’ she said			0
‘ they just wo n’t pay			0
they just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action			0
’ but @entity299 , head of taxation at the @entity301 , said : ‘ there is a dangerous sense of “ @entity29 ” about it			0
' there is a fear that this will set a precedent for @entity6 and other government agencies [ such as the collection of unpaid council tax ]			2
‘ this is a dangerous route to begin to go down			0
‘ these powers , if implemented , will affect families and individuals , as well as small businesses , up and down the country and not large multi-national businesses with armies of lawyers and accountants on hand to prevent it happening			0
’ @entity6 ’s consultation document says revealing bank or @entity11 statements would ‘ strike a sensible balance ’ between ensuring it has accurate information and maintaining the debtor ’s privacy			1
but lord @entity96 added : ‘ @entity6 is asking to become judge , jury and executioner on this			2
‘ is it not very concerning that we are removing from the process that currently exists the legal process simply because it is slow and expensive ? ’			0
