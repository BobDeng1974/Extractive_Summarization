the prime minister will emphasise the commitment by insisting that @entity23 becomes part of the school curriculum			1
@entity36 stressed the prime minister ’s comments , which come in an article in today ’s @entity40 , are aimed at all sections of the community , not just @entity43			2
however , they appear to signal a key change in the stance of successive recent governments , @entity46 and @entity47 , on this sensitive issue			0

the dispute convinced mr @entity0 that it was time to lead a fightback on behalf of @entity3 values			1

‘ in recent years we have been in danger of sending out a worrying message : that if you do n’t want to believe in democracy , that ’s fine ; that if equality is n’t your bag , do n’t worry about it ; that if you ’re completely intolerant of others , we will still tolerate you , ’ he writes			0
‘ this has not just led to division , it has also allowed extremism – of both the violent and non-violent kind – to flourish			0
