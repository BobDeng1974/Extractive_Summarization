the last time a divided @entity1 passed a budget deal , president @entity0 was denying he traded arms for @entity5 hostages and the @entity7 explosion was fresh in @entity9 ' minds			1
but a @entity11 @entity10 and a @entity13 senator hope they 've found a compromise that federal legislators can live with			2
@entity17 democrat @entity16 and @entity19 @entity10 @entity18 announced a proposal late on tuesday that @entity18 said focuses ' on where the common ground is ' between @entity9 's two political parties , a deal that would balance the federal budget ten years from now and sidestep the threat of government shutdowns in january and october 2014			1
future congresses could undo the terms of the arrangement , and the current @entity1 has yet to see the plan or consider it , however			0
and conservative groups are working overtime to kill the deal while it 's still in the crib			1
' @entity37 has been a dirty word ' in @entity39 , @entity36 complained in an evening news conference			2
but ' we have broken through the partisanship and the gridlock			0
' the two promised the details of their agreement would be available online by late tuesday night			0
while it contains no new taxes , @entity59 said some new government ' fees ' will be baked into the cake but their initial outline calls for $ 85 billion in total budget savings and $ 63 billion in ' sequester relief , reducing the annual deficit by $ 23 billion			1
that includes $ 45 billion of targeted cuts in 2014			2
president @entity59 said in a statement that he wants members of @entity1 from both parties ' to take the next step and actually pass a budget based on this agreement so i can sign it into law and our economy can continue growing and creating jobs without more @entity39 headwinds			1
' ' i think conservatives should vote for it , ' @entity18 said , despite rumblings from the political right that the negotiated budget settlement still spends too much taxpayer money he praised the @entity92 – @entity36 deal as ' balanced , and includes targeted fee increases and spending cuts designed in a way that does n’t hurt our economy or break the ironclad promises we ’ve made to our seniors			1
' his use of the word ' fees , ' not ' taxes , ' agrees with @entity18 's insistence that ' there are no tax increases here			1
' but @entity36 cautioned in the joint press conference that the so - called ' sequester ' budget cuts instituted early in 2013 ' should n't be replaced with spending cuts alone			1
' she , too , said the agreement would ' roll back sequestration ’s cuts to defense and domestic investments in a " balanced " way			2
' ' this is n't the plan i would have written on my own , ' she acknowledged , and ' i 'm pretty sure chairman @entity18 would n't have written it on his own			2
' but the compromise , both insisted , would be good for the future of the @entity9 @entity18 took a poke at the @entity127 - run @entity52 , saying that his ideal budget could never become law in the current @entity1 but the resulting legislation , he said , ' reduces the deficit by $ 23 billion , it does not raise taxes , and it cuts spending in a smarter way , ' i see this agreement as a step in the right direction			1
' conservatives both inside and outside of @entity1 began carping as soon as news emerged tuesday morning that a budget bargain was in the works , guessing that it would n't likely include enough spending cuts to satisfy them			1
@entity145 @entity10 @entity144 , the ranking @entity10 on the @entity52 , warned @entity146 that ' the deal is not going to be what mainstream @entity10 hoped for			0
' it 'll probably turn out to be a very tough call for a lot of people who want to have an agreement but also want to see progress made in certain areas , ' @entity144 said			0
' i do n’t think a deal has to be reached if it 's not a good deal			0
' ' there is a lot more for @entity1 to do , ' @entity36 warned , signaling that immigration reform will be next on the @entity52 's agenda after the @entity162 allies of sessions and other lawmakers to the right of the @entity10 's center went on the offensive eary in the day			0
@entity169 , a tea party - linked organization known for anti-tax and smaller - government positions , said it would oppose the deal ' in its current reported form			2
' the libertarian @entity175 also voiced disapproval , as did @entity177 , the conservative @entity178 's grassroots organizing and political - pressure arm			0
' @entity177 can not support a budget deal that would increase spending in the near - term for promises of woefully inadequate long - term reductions , ' the group said on monday			1
' a gimmicky , spend - now - cut - later deal will take our nation in the wrong direction			0
' the group 's communications director , @entity190 , told @entity192 that his group will wait to render a final opinion until the terms of the deal are made public			0
@entity198 , another conservative group , agreed after the press conference that it would press hard for ' no ' votes and argue for continuing the sequester cuts			1
' this budget compromise is not just bad policy , it is bad politics , ' said @entity206 , ' the group 's president , in a statement			2
' this is about protecting the pocketbook of average @entity9 , not about shutting down the government or refusing to compromise			2
lawmakers should simply continue an existing , bi-partisan agreement that has already reduced overspending and has not compromising our modest economic recovery			0
' ' spending levels were set by law at $ 967 billion			1
exceeding those levels by $ 45 billion takes us in the wrong direction , ' @entity206 said			2
@entity18 and @entity36 have spent weeks hammering out the deal since october 's partial government shutdown came to a close but @entity18 fended off journalists ' questions about whether @entity11 conservatives would embrace the product of a weeks - long negotiation that could evaporate if enough tea partiers refuse to play ball with @entity11 moderates			1
house speaker @entity233 will have a hard time advancing the agreement to a floor vote if he ca n't get assent from a majority of @entity239 , in the tradition of an informal rule put in place by former speaker @entity243			0
' i think conservatives should vote for it , ' @entity18 said , predicting that the @entity11 will pass the bill			2
the deal , he explained , focuses on ' providing some sequester relief for 2014 and 2015 , and paying for that with spending reforms ... that , to me , is a good deal			1
the federal government will still spend $ 1.012 trillion in 2014 and $ 1.014 trillion in 2015.under the terms of the deal , but @entity18 predicted that right - wing @entity10 members would take a long view ' the budget number that we fought for in the last session [ in 2011 – 2012 ] wo n't be hit until the year 2017 under this agreement , ' he said			1
and @entity1 , he added , will ' start to make real reform to these auto - pilot programs that are the drivers of our debt in the first place			0
' herding cats : house speaker @entity233 will have his hands full wednesday morning when tea party - aligned conservatives in his caucus are expected to pledge their opposition to @entity18 's bargain with democrats @entity36 lamented the deal 's lack of action on ' closing corporate tax loopholes , ' but said @entity13 will warm to the fact that it includes no changes to @entity280 or @entity281			1
' and ' there is a lot more for @entity1 to do , ' she said			0
'' we know we need comprehensive tax reform			0
we need comprehensive immigration reform			0
' and @entity1 , @entity36 hoped , will ' show that we can do something without a crisis right around the corner			0
' @entity11 @entity10 leaders are itching to finish their legislative year by friday , but @entity52 @entity13 have signaled that they plan to meet next week			0
that could put the @entity10 in a tough position if the @entity52 votes to pass an amended version of the @entity18 – @entity36 proposal , since they would have to choose between gaveling back into session or enduring an extended holiday break while risking being labeled as obstructionists			1
the @entity300 will meet at 9:00 a.m. on wednesday to discuss next steps .			0

conservative groups want to stick with the ' sequester ' budget cuts instead of spending more in a deal with democrats
rep. @entity18 and sen. @entity16 unveiled a bipartisan proposal tuesday that would modestly trim the federal budget
the resulting spending levels would still exceed $ 1 trillion per year
@entity59 wants the compromise to succeed , calling it a ' balanced ' approach , a code word usually *referring* to new sources of government *revenue*
but @entity18 insisted that there are ' no new taxes ' baked into the cake of the deal
