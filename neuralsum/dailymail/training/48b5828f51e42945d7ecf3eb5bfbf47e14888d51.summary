@entity0 was found dead in @entity1 , @entity2 after attempting overdoses in the past			0
her family have said she was treated ' like a time - waster ' a charity worker who had attempted suicide a dozen times was failed by doctors when she was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose , an inquest heard			1
@entity0 was not given a mental health assessment despite suffering severe depression for years			1
the 27 - year - old , who felt doctors saw her as an attention seeker and a time - waster , was left on a ward without proper monitoring even though she had warned she would try again to kill herself			1
hours after her admission to @entity1 , @entity2 , ms @entity0 was found hanged by her hospital bed by nurses carrying out their rounds - having earlier left her cubicle curtains ajar in the hope of being found			1
@entity29 tried to revive her but she died six days later when her family agreed to let doctors switch off her life support machine			2
in the hours before her death , ms @entity0 , from @entity1 had told a worker ' there 's no point ' when asked what she wanted for tea - but her comment was treated as a remark about the quality of hospital food			1
at inquest into her death a coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure contributed to by neglect			1
the coroner condemned hospital staff for ' serious and significant failures ' and said a referral to mental health experts would have saved ms @entity0 's life			1
he also branded the hospital 's investigation into the tragedy as ' lamentable ' after it emerged some staff on duty at the time of the tragedy were not even asked to give statements			1
ms @entity0 's mother , @entity61 , 52 , said today : ' we have listened to a lack of co-operation and communication , compounded by mismanagement , lack of compassionate care lack of record keeping and a frightening confusion among senior staff regarding the hospital 's own policies and procedures			1
' unfortunately , despite pleading with her many times over the years , @entity0 did not involve us in her mental health care			1
her intention was never to die but she mentioned to friends and counsellors how variable the care would be on visits to the hospital			2
' sometimes she had a good experience but sometimes she felt largely ignored and regarded as an attention seeker and time - waster			1
' no one would regard a patient suffering from cancer or a heart complaint as a nuisance but people suffering mental illness come across attitudes like this all the time			2
' there has been a lot of talk about the need for more compassion in the @entity100			0
we would argue that a person suffering from mental illness could be deemed to be most in need of this			2
' from the evidence at the inquest we know there was a catalogue of missed opportunities for psychiatric referral from @entity0 's arrival at @entity113			1
' an inquest heard ms @entity0 had become depressed after she was branded a ' grass ' by noisy neighbours the tragedy occurred in july 2012 after ms @entity0 - who hoped to become a paramedic and was described by her family as ' a beautiful , funny , intelligent , creative and caring young woman ' - had been battling mental illness for up to 13 years			1
she had @entity122 which meant she had a fear of ' rejection and abandonment			0
' she was a youth volunteer for @entity126 and had won awards for her voluntary work			0
her commitment to @entity130 was recognised with the @entity131 , which was given to her by @entity132 at @entity133			0
ms @entity0 enrolled at @entity134 to study @entity135 but suffered a break down due to the stress of studying and being away			2
despite concerns over her welfare , she later appeared to rally and moved into a flat in @entity1 but her mental condition worsened after she complained of being hounded by noisy neighbours			1
she filed a complaint to housing officials about loud music being played next to her rented flat - but she ended up being labelled a ' grass			2
' after applying for an alarm to fitted to her home for fear of having intruders , she was admitted to @entity1 in july 2012 with a suspected overdose of medication			2
shortly after her admission she told staff she was feeling down and ' stressed ' about her neighbours			2
a coroner heard ms @entity0 told a nurse there was ' no point ' when asked if she wanted a cup of tea the hospitals - whose staff assumed ms @entity0 was complaining about food - have now apologised care support worker @entity166 said : ' i was asked to take her out for cigarette which is a routine duty			1
outside she said she was fed up			0
she was sick of her neighbours annoying her			2
she had trouble with her neighbours			2
' she could n't be bothered anymore			0
she wanted to do it again and she said she would do it again when she got home			0
i asked if she had anyone she could talk to			0
i told the first staff nurse i saw on the ward and whoever it was just said leave it with me			0
' patient @entity181 said she had been speaking to @entity182 in the minutes before the tragedy and said : ' it was pretty mundane conversation really - like she 'd been on the ward too long			2
the last time i saw @entity187 , she was lying on the bed			0
' mrs @entity181 went to the bathroom and noticed the curtains around the bed had been drawn slightly but added : ' the only time she knew something serious had happened was when the nurse rushed in and the alarm went off			0
' the hearing was told @entity0 self harmed to ' alleviate stress			0
' she had bags packed with clothes for several days and talked of holidays and returning to her studies - indicating there was no intention to end her own life			0
dr @entity205 , a consultant forensic psychiatrist at @entity100 who prepared a report on @entity0 said : ' she was impulsive and took risks which explains why she had taken overdoses as she was ' going to the edge '			0
she was always anticipating that she would be found which explains that on a previous overdose , she remained calm , was extremely helpful to paramedics and had written a list of exactly what she had taken			0
' on the day she was admitted no mental health assessment was taken and there was nothing on record			1
there is absolutely no question that a mental health assessment would have helped			1
she had no intention of dying			0
' the inquest heard ms @entity0 had moved to a property in @entity1 , @entity2 but felt intimidated @entity2 coroner @entity225 said hospital staff should have kept records about when @entity0 should be kept under observation but there was ' nothing of note recorded			1
' he added : ' @entity0 was a well - loved young woman who suffered from recurrent depressive episodes which led to self - harming to relieve inner tension			1
she was vulnerable to certain life pressures but there was no evidence to suggest she was contemplating the taking of her own life			0
' there was a series of significant failures to refer her for a mental health assessment especially as she had attempted an overdose 12 times previously			1
the fact that she had the curtains closed slightly around her bed suggested that she wanted to be found			0
' observations on @entity0 should have been increased			0
it is possible had she been referred as soon as possible for a mental health assessment her life would have been saved or prolonged			1
' in a statement dr @entity252 , medical director at @entity253 ( @entity1 ) , said : ' @entity255 would again wish to convey its sincere condolences to the family of ms @entity258			0
' we are sincerely sorry for their loss and we will cooperate fully with the coroner 's recommendations to further improve on the changes the @entity265 has already implemented			2
' following the sad death of ms @entity0 in july 2012 , we have been focusing on improving and strengthening our processes for assessing and treating patients with mental health conditions who present to our @entity113 and who are subsequently admitted to our wards			1
' we would like to apologise unreservedly to the family of ms @entity0 , our hearts go out to them			0
' we would again wish to reiterate our invitation to her family to meet with senior representatives at @entity1 if they feel this would be helpful for them			0
' since ms @entity0 's death , her family and friends have set up the @entity265 to raise money for charity @entity285			1
