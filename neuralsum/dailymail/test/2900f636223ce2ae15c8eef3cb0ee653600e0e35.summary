more than a third of health trusts are considering rationing some types of surgery and other treatments to save money , according to a new study the criteria for accepting patients for operations would be based on their @entity25 , which measures obesity			1
when senior managers at 67 @entity28 – local health trusts – were asked , 39 per cent said they were planning to ' limit access ' to routine treatment for financial reasons			1
procedures affected include varicose vein treatment , hip and knee replacement , and breast reduction surgery			1
others said smokers might be denied some treatments , most commonly @entity41			1
senior doctors criticised the plans and accused health managers of denying patients vital treatment simply because they were considered to be ' undeserving '			1
dr @entity47 , of the @entity48 , said : ' decisions about whether our patients are eligible for surgery or treatment need to be made on a case - by - case basis and by whether surgery will benefit a patient 's long - term physical and mental health			1
' it should not be the role of @entity60 to impose blanket bans on patients ' access to surgery , nor to decide who is and who is not deserving of potentially life - saving treatments based on their lifestyle choices			1
obese patients could be denied varicose vein treatment , hip and knee replacement , pictured , and breast reduction surgery , while smokers could be banned from having @entity41 on the @entity7 ' of course , some procedures can not be performed on patients who are above a certain weight			1
' in these cases , a clinical decision needs to be made about whether surgery would be beneficial if the patient lost weight – but this is a separate issue			1
' @entity83 , chief executive of the @entity84 , said : ' each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient			2
' it is easy to target vulnerable patients and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who are n't always able to speak out			2
' a @entity94 spokesman said : ' if health bodies stop patients from having treatments on the basis of cost alone , then we will take action against them			1
' there are 211 @entity60 in @entity102 so the survey by the @entity104 covered just under a third			2
last year , a @entity28 in @entity105 threatened to ban all non-urgent treatments for anyone severely obese with a @entity25 above 35			2
this is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 16st or a 6ft man being 18st 13lb			2
after an outcry , the policy was dropped			2
a survey by @entity114 last month found that 80 per cent of @entity60 ration at least one procedure to patients who are very obese			1
doctors have blamed excess sugar and carbohydrates for the surge in obesity – not the lack of exercise			0
they said poor diet was now recognised as being responsible for more disease than physical inactivity , alcohol and smoking combined			0
yet , said the experts led by cardiologist dr @entity132 , the public wrongly believed that obesity was due to a sedentary lifestyle			0
the doctors claimed that obesity has rocketed in the past 30 years , despite little change in physical activity levels			0
‘ this places the blame for our expanding waistlines directly on the type and amount of calories consumed , ’ said dr @entity132			0
‘ let us bust the myth of physical inactivity and obesity			0
you can not outrun a bad diet			0
’ in the @entity153 , the doctors added that the ‘ false perception ’ on the cause of obesity stems from corporate marketing ‘ chillingly similar ’ to that used by the tobacco industry			0
they cited @entity160 associating its products with sport ‘ suggesting it is ok to consume their drinks as long as you exercise ’			0
dr @entity132 , who works at @entity167 , @entity168 , is an adviser to the campaign group action on @entity170			0
around two - thirds of @entity172 are overweight or obese			2
the government ’s obesity adviser professor @entity173 said the doctors failed to note that the best way to lose weight was combining a better diet with physical activity			0
‘ rather than trade one off against the other – sugar vs fat , diet vs activity , individual vs population – we need to take action across the full range , ’ she added			0
tackling obesity without addressing physical activity was ‘ tying one hand behind our backs ’ said the professor			0
‘ it makes good sense to seek to change both diet and activity behaviours			0
