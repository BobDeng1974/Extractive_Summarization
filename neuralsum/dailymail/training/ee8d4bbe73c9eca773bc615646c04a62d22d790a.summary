by @entity0 a springer spaniel survived after leaping 50 feet from an infamous ‘ dog suicide ’ bridge - with no broken bones			1
owner @entity4 , 50 , was walking @entity5 across @entity6 , near @entity7 , when her pet suddenly jumped over a parapet onto the stony ground below			1
mrs @entity4 and her son @entity11 , 24 , peered over the bridge fearing the worst but were shocked to see three - year - old @entity5 struggle to her feet			1
this is the spot where @entity5 the springer spaniel jumped from the 50ft high @entity6 , near @entity7 , which has been dubbed the ' dog suicide bridge ' mrs @entity4 , a staff nurse , said : ' i will never forget the awful whine she made as she leapt			1
' my heart just dropped			0
i have no idea how she survived , the bridge is so high			2
i was almost certain that she had died			0
mrs @entity4 said @entity5 raced over to the bridge as soon she got out of their car and looked left as though she had seen something			1
@entity5 then jumped off , something mrs @entity4 said was ' so uncharacteristic , she has never done anything like that before '			1
@entity4 said she will never forget the ' awful whine ' @entity5 made after leaping off the bridge @entity5 only suffered a pulled muscle in her leg , something mrs @entity4 said was a ' complete miracle ' she added : ' my son looked down and all he could see was a dot			1
she managed to get herself up and met my son , collapsing when she saw him			0
' luckily she did n’t have any serious injuries , just a pulled muscle in one of her back legs			1
it is a complete miracle			0
' only one other dog has been known to survive falling from the 19th century bridge which is higher than a four - storey building			1
the landmark has been dubbed the ' dog suicide bridge ' as it is believed between 50 and 100 dogs have jumped to their deaths from it in the last five decades			1
mrs @entity4 was unaware of the bridge 's eerie history before she walked @entity5 there and is now campaigning for warning signs to be put up to warn other dog owners the unexplained phenomenon has prompting the @entity59 to send an animal habitat expert to investigate why dogs are jumping off			1
it is believed that the odour from male minks could be luring the dogs to their deaths			1
while some simply believe the bridge is haunted			2
professor @entity68 from the department of animal sciences at @entity71 said it was ' highly unlikely ' that the dogs were deliberately jumping to their deaths			2
he said dogs live in the present , so ' are unable to contemplate the future and how they will be feeling ' , and make plans accordingly			2
professor @entity68 said : ' of course dogs do get depressed , but this would not lead them to taking their own life			2
' mrs @entity4 said she was not aware of the bridge 's history , and had no concerns when she walked @entity5 three three weeks ago			1
' i had never heard of this happening before even though i ’ve lived here for 25 years			0
but now i know all about the stories			0
i ’m quite a spiritual person and i believe that @entity5 was protected that day			1
' how else do you explain how she escaped with no broken bones , not even a fracture			0
she should have a shattered pelvis after falling from that height			0
' the @entity7 mum - of - two is now campaigning to have a sign erected to warn other dog walkers			1
she has contacted msp @entity98 who intends to lobby the council			0
ms @entity98 said : ' this is not the first time this has happened			0
i have heard many heart - breaking stories about dog owners who have lost their pets due to this unexplained phenomenon			1
' in the last 50 years it between 50 - 100 dogs have lept to their deaths from the bridge seen below only two dogs are believed to have survived the four - storey fall			1
during one six month period in 2005 , five dogs jumped to their deaths			2
all of the deaths occurred at the same spot on the bridge			2
almost all have occurred on clear , sunny days			0
the dogs involved were all long - nosed breeds : labradors , collies and retrievers			2
it has long been thought the bridge , and nearby @entity6 are haunted			2
in @entity130 mythology , @entity128 is known as ' the thin place ' - an area in which heaven and earth are reputed to be close			0
in 1994 , local man @entity136 threw his baby son to his death from the bridge			0
shortly after he unsuccessfully tried to end his own life by jumping from it			0
professor @entity68 said it was ' highly unlikely ' the dogs were trying to kill themselves			0
