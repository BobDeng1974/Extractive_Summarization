the @entity1 ’s minute hand has been moved two minutes closer to midnight as experts warn we are closer than ever to a global catastrophe			1
in a live international news conference , the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) said that the threat of climate change and nuclear war posed a very serious threat to modern society			1

scroll down for full timeline and video in an announcement today the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) has moved the minute hand of the symbolic @entity1 forward by two minutes			1
it is now at three minutes to midnight , the closest it has been since 1984			1
the @entity5 moved the clock due to the threat of nuclear war and climate change the conference took place at 4pm gmt ( 11am est ) today			1
key topics discussed included evidence of accelerating climate change and the increasing threat of nuclear war after failed promises from various international governments			1
‘ the danger is great but our message is not one of hopelessness , ’ @entity34 , executive director of the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , said in the announcement			2
she said that there was still time to act , but real steps needed to be taken soon in order to ‘ avert catastrophe			2
’ ‘ we find conditions to be so threatening that we are moving the hand two minutes closer			0
it is now three minutes to midnight , ’ she continued			0
countries emitting carbon dioxide and other gases are transforming @entity52 ’s climate in a dangerous way , she said , leaving millions vulnerable to rising sea levels , famines and ' killer storms			0
' she also cited a failure by governments around the world to reduce their nuclear arsenal , in particular the @entity61 and @entity62			0
in total it is estimated 16,300 nuclear weapons remain in the world - and just 50 to 100 could produce massive casualties and long lasting effects on the atmosphere			0
the @entity5 was founded in 1945 by @entity71 scientists who had helped develop the first atomic weapons in the @entity73			1

the @entity5 hosted a live conference to reveal the @entity86 's decision to move the clock two minutes closer to midnight countries emitting carbon dioxide and other gases ( stock image shown ) are transforming @entity52 ’s climate in a dangerous way , according to the @entity5 , leaving millions vulnerable to rising sea levels , famines and ' killer storms			1
' the @entity5 want to see action taken to cap greenhouse gases to 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels ‘ members of the @entity5 board are today imploring citizens of the world to speak clearly and demand leaders take necessary steps , ’ ms @entity34 continued			0
the @entity5 want to see action taken to cap greenhouse gases to 2 ° c above pre-industrial levels , and reduce spending on nuclear weapons			2
‘ we are not saying it is too late , but the window for action is closing rapidly , ’ she added			0
‘ the world needs to awaken from its lethargy			0
moving the clock hand inspires changes to help push the process along			0

this graphic from last year 's @entity160 ( @entity160 ) report shows observed examples of climate change worldwide the decision to move the minute hand of the @entity1 is made by the @entity5 's board of directors in consultation with its @entity166 , which includes 18 @entity167			1
the clock has become a universally recognised indicator of the world 's vulnerability to catastrophe from nuclear weapons , climate change , and emerging technologies in life sciences			1
since it was set up , the hand on the clock has moved 18 times , and each move represents how the scientists view the world 's chances of survival in the face of these threats			1

the first nuclear age ended with the signing of the @entity202 in 1991 by the @entity61 and @entity62			0
however , according to the @entity5 , both countries have a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons that could be launched at a moment 's notice			2
at the time , the @entity5 criticised nuclear watchdogs around the world for failing to take a stand on these weapons and national policies			2

some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years - especially wheat and corn			0
violent conflict may be triggered as a result climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems , such as civil wars , strife between nations and refugees			1
fights over resources , like water and energy , hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world			0
gap between the rich and poor to widen poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change , the report said			2
climate change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities , and it is going to make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty			2
in 2014 , the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) report said there was evidence of accelerating climate change , and criticised the world 's efforts to curb greenhouse emissions			1
global temperatures last year were the highest since records began in 1880 , according to @entity61 scientists			0
and 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred in the 21st century , something highlighted by president @entity279 in his recent @entity281 address			0

last year , president @entity279 revealed his country 's 30 - year plan to modernise its nuclear program			0
the modernisation is expected to cost almost £ 660 billion ( $ 1 trillion ) , according to the @entity293 .			0

symbolic clock was established by @entity73 scientists in 1947
it 's designed to show how close civilisation is to facing global catastrophe
in an announcement the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) moved the minute hand forward by two minutes
it is now at three minutes to midnight , the closest it has been since 1984
the @entity5 moved the clock due to threat of nuclear war and climate change
last time the @entity1 minute hand moved was in *january* 2012 , when it was pushed from six to five minutes before midnight
