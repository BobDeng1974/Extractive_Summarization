by @entity0 published : 10:48 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:04 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 might be one of the best known dinosaurs , but scientists are still not exactly sure how the prehistoric giant walked			1
and in a bid to find out , a group of researchers attached fake tails to chickens and analysed the way they walked			2
while the idea might look more like a school project than a serious experiment , the scientists chose chickens because modern birds descend from a group of dinosaurs that includes the @entity3			1
@entity3 lived during the @entity29 - 66million years ago			1
while most people think the carnivorous dinosaur stood upright , it had a bird - like posture and kept its tail in the air and its head pitched forward			2
its massive skull was balanced by its heavy tail , which was around 15 per cent of its body mass. the creature would have changed direction slowly because if its massive inertia but was agile enough to run			0
@entity3 had a top speed of 25mph ( 40kmp ) which is a little slower than a horse			2
scientists from the @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 created prosthetic tails to simulate how a seven tonne @entity3 , which measured over 40ft long , would have walked			1
the fearsome dinosaur roamed the earth in the @entity29 , around 66million years ago			0
the dinosaur belonged to the theropod group of dinosaurs , which also included the foot - long @entity55 , all of which are very distantly related to birds today			0
they conducted the bizarre experiment to study the way the dinosaur ’s descendent moves with the addition of a long and relatively heavy tail , which is actually a wooden stick with modelling clay that four chickens have worn from birth			1
scientists from the @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 created the prosthetic tail to simulate how a seven tonne @entity3 ( illustrated ) , which measured over 40ft long , would have walked the scientists were careful to keep the tails at 15 per cent of the birds ' body weight , so they had to continuously replace them while they were growing , @entity71 reported			1
they chose the weight because they think the proportion is similar to the weight of a theropod dinosaur ’s tail , compared to its body			0
the researchers discovered that the chickens raised with the tails walked in a different way to those without them			0
the birds with the prosthetic tails stood with their femurs – their upper leg bones – held more vertically and moved their knees differently when walking to the control birds , the study in the journal @entity89 revealed			2
the birds with the prosthetic tails stood with their femurs - the upper leg bones - held more vertically and moved their knees differently when walking to the control birds , the study said			1
the control birds ' leg position is shown in grey and the chickens ' wearing the tails in orange the study found that while the control birds moved from the knee , the chickens wearing the tails displayed a more hip - driven movement ‘ these results indicate a shift from the standard bird , knee - driven bipedal locomotion to a more hip - driven locomotion , typical of crocodilians … mammals , and hypothetically , bipedal non-avian dinosaurs , ’ the scientists wrote			1
the scientists also raised a small brood of chickens wearing weighted coats to ensure that it was n't just the extra weight that caused the birds ’ change of posture and way of walking			0
but they found that the birds wearing the weighted coats close to the centre of their mass , walked similarly to the control chickens , indicating it was the tail that made the difference			0
the scientists said : ‘ our experimental approach , although not perfect , was effective in displacing the [ chickens ’ centre of mass ] and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods			0
‘ we expect that careful ... manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics , providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution , ’ they added .			0

scientists from the @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48 created the prosthetic tail
they studied chickens because they are distant descendants of @entity3
study reveals that the chickens with tails seemed to walk with more of a hip - driven movement , suggesting that perhaps *therapod* dinosaurs did too
