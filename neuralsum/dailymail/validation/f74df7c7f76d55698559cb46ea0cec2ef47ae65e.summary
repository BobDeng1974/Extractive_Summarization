while there are many threats to the endangered @entity4 mammals , startling photographs have emerged of a feral cat killing and eating a four - kilogram marsupial			1
the photographic evidence , which was published on the @entity8 , captured a rare moment of the predator preying on an adult female @entity12 pademelon			1
pademelons or rufous wallaby species , which are small marsupials with a relatively short tale and legs , are found in thick scrubland across @entity12			2
but the furry creatures are at an alarmingly high rate of extinction in @entity4 as it continues to be wiped out because of its ’ perfectly ‘ meal - size ’ portion for their predators			0
a camera survey has captured a rare moment between a feral cat ( right ) preying on a pademelon ( left ) one of @entity4 ’s leading researchers , scientist @entity31 found compelling evidence of predation risk after conducting a camera survey in the @entity36 in south - east of @entity12			1
the camera captured a pademelon scouring through grassland but four minutes later , a feral cat leapt into the frame as it pounced on its victim about 7.50pm on october 23			2
biting the pademelon around its neck , the cat then dragged the carcass out of the frame as it devoured most of the abdominal organs			0
the @entity49 was seen scouring through grassland before the cat pounced on top and attacked it to death the cat is seen biting into the pademelon 's neck and throat , killing the marsupial instantly the cat eventually dragged the carcass back into view almost eight hours later			0
the pademelon ’s head and body were left intact , along with her feet , arms , pouch and tail			0
the predator pulls the carcass out of the screen again but returns into the frame a minute later to clean its paw and face after consuming its meal before running away			0
@entity31 , from the @entity79 said her observation provides direct evidence that feral cats are competent of killing their prey at up to four kilograms in body mass. the abdominal cavity rips open and the cat continues devouring through the abdominal organs the sex of the species also demonstrates that medium - sized pedemelons such as adult females and juveniles are at high risk of being eaten than the larger adult male marsupials			1
the research found not only do feral cats hunt and kill their prey but they tend to scavenge on carcasses after it had been killed by another predator such as foxes or dingoes			0
despite the photo evidence , @entity31 said a single observation does not prove feral cats are entirely responsible for the extinct species , adding foxes may have been the ‘ primary causes of population decline ’ .			1

photo evidence could indicate feral cats are behind alarming extinctions
a camera survey captured a feral cat devouring on a four kg marsupial
the photographs *document* a rare moment of the predator and pademelon
@entity49 or rufous wallaby are at a high risk of extinction in @entity12
