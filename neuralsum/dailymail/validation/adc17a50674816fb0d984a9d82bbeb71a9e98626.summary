a watchdog has cleared officers over the case of a four - year - old boy starved to death by his alcoholic mother , despite years of police contact with the family			1
@entity9 's decomposed body was found in a cot at his filthy home in @entity12 in 2011 , almost two years after he had died			1
the family , including his mother @entity15 , 43 , had extensive contact with police over a number of years , but today the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) found that @entity9 's death was not something @entity22 ' could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent ' , the police watchdog has found			1
a watchdog has cleared @entity22 over the case of four - year - old @entity9 ( pictured ) , who was starved to death by his alcoholic mother despite years of police contact with the family mother - of - eight @entity15 was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of @entity9 's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children			1
at her trial it emerged that a range of agencies , including police officers , had contact with her family because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence , but no one spotted the danger the children were in			1
the @entity19 had launched an investigation into @entity22 ’s handling of concerns raised about @entity9 ’s welfare , the results of which were announced today			0
in a statement , the watchdog said : ' the @entity19 investigation concluded that @entity9 's death was not something @entity22 could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent , and that it was the actions of a @entity53 who made repeated and concerted attempts to speak to ms @entity15 that led to the discovery of @entity9 's body			1
' mother - of - eight @entity15 ( pictured ) was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of @entity9 's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children the commission said there had been no misconduct by officers but did criticise the force for not referring itself to the @entity19 at the time the body was discovered			1
it said the fact it was not referred ' hindered the @entity19 in its obligation to carry out a prompt and effective independent investigation into @entity22 's contact with the family '			2
@entity19 commissioner @entity74 said : ' there was a clear public interest in enabling the @entity19 to scrutinise the actions of @entity79 police officers after the discovery of @entity9 's body in 2011			1
' the fact that this was not reported to the @entity19 until after a serious case review had been completed in 2013 meant that that process was completed without any independent scrutiny of police action			0
' @entity15 's trial heard how @entity9 's father , @entity89 , raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for attacking @entity15 but detectives told the court these were investigated and no problems were found			1
today , the @entity19 said two officers chose not to make a referral to social services after specific allegations of neglect were made during this interview in december 2008			2
but it said in its statement : ' the @entity19 found that a number of referrals had already been made , one of which was made only five days before the interview with mr @entity9			0
a further referral to social services could have been made but there was no requirement for the officers to do so			0
' a serious case review in @entity9 's case concluded that he was ' invisible for almost a lifetime '			0
but that review was criticised at its publication by children 's minister @entity116 , who expressed ' deep concerns ' , saying it failed to fully explain ' missed opportunities to protect children in the house '			0
the minister wrote to professor @entity123 , who chairs the @entity124 , saying : ' i have deep concerns over the @entity9 serious case review			0
the child 's body was found in what police said were ' breathtakingly awful ' conditions in a bedroom at @entity15 's house in @entity12 , while the kitchen was also filled with rubbish the living room of @entity15 's home was covered in old takeaway boxes , bottles and plastic bags ' in particular , i am concerned that it fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken or not taken by children 's social care when problems in the @entity9 family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions			1
' @entity151 was living in what the report described as ' breathtakingly awful ' conditions with five of her children as well as @entity9 's mummified remains when police entered her four - bedroom house in september 2011			2
a jury at @entity158 found she had allowed @entity9 to starve to death in december 2009 and left his body in a cot with a teddy			2
the remains were only discovered due to a rookie police community support officer 's tenacious pursuit of a minor anti-social behaviour complaint because she knew something was wrong			0
the family was known to all the main agencies , partly due to a long history of violence @entity15 suffered at the hands of @entity9			0
but @entity15 failed to co-operate with many children 's services and the @entity175 found that @entity9 slipped below the radar and was invisible			2
ms @entity74 said today : ' nothing could have reasonably been done by @entity22 to predict or prevent this horrendous case of child neglect			0
in fact , it was the tenacity of one of its officers that led to the eventual discovery of his body			0

@entity9 's decomposed body found in cot two years after his death
@entity15 , 43 , jailed for 15 years for manslaughter and neglect
police had contact with family as mother was domestic violence victim
@entity202 's neglect concerns from 2008 were not referred to social services
@entity19 finds @entity9 's death was not something police ' could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent '
