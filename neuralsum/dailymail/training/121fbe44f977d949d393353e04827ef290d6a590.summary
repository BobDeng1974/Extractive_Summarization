a young lecturer who weighed 21 stone due to gorging on ready meals , crisps and up to four litres of @entity4 a day has lost more than a third of his bodyweight through a strict new fitness regime			1
@entity8 , 26 , from @entity9 , gained weight on a student diet of full @entity13 breakfasts , pizza and an addiction to fizzy drinks			1
after a doctor made an offhand comment about his weight , he began walking to work , running and taking military fitness classes , tracking his progress using his smartphone			1
after losing eight and a half stone in seven months , he looked so different some people did not recognise him in the street			1
he has now run a 10km assault course in under an hour and a half for charity , and has even been pursued by a girl for the first time			1
‘ i could n’t walk the 500m from work to my car without breaking into a sweat before and now i walk up a 4km hill to work with ease			2
‘ some people do n’t recognise me any more - i 've had to re-introduce myself to people i know , which is funny			1
‘ it felt like i was wearing a mask , but now people ’s reactions to me are different			1
‘ but my mum said , the mask is off now , this is the real you			2
’ mr @entity8 said he slowly gained weight as a teenager because of a general lack of knowledge about health and fitness , and his habit of snacking on chocolate			1
he said : ‘ the weight slowly built up ever since i was 13			1
i was always big , but not massive			1
‘ i was always the same amount of stones as my age			1
' living at home with his parents , there was plenty of fresh food food for him to make fairly healthy meals with			1
mr @entity8 said : ' i did n’t have to go shopping and so all the food was there , so i could make fairly healthy meals easily with all the food in the house			1
‘ but if i was hungry , and i fancied a chocolate bar , i ’d eat it			2
‘ if i liked the look of something i ’d just eat it without thinking about it			0
’ by the time mr @entity8 was 26 he weighed 21 stone , eating pizza , takeaways and up to four litres of cola a day a doctor making a comment about his weight spurred mr @entity8 into joining @entity95 classes which he now attends three times a week by the time he left home at 18 to study maths at @entity9 university , he weighed 18 stone			1
at university , his diet deteriorated even further as he began to eat lots of processed food , takeaways as well as fizzy drinks and nights out with lots of alcohol			1
he said : ‘ i ’d eat microwave ready meals or meal deal lunches which always involved a big white baguette			1
‘ now looking back i could have just eaten brown bread and halved the calories			0
before breakfast : full @entity13 breakfast lunch : ham or cheese white baguette with lots of mayonnaise dinner : pizza , a ready meal or a takeaway drinks : @entity128 , beer and port snacks : crisps , chocolate after breakfast : three @entity135 with soy milk or low fat plain yoghurt with fruit mid morning : protein shake , a @entity141 biscuit and a banana lunch : chicken or ham sandwiches made with wholemeal bread , and mustard dinner : soup with wholemeal bread drink : @entity150 , no alcohol snacks : snack a @entity154 , baked crisps or fruit ‘ pizza was a favourite			1
i was definitely eating kebabs on a friday night			0
‘ and huge mixed grills			0
i would go on @entity162 and i needed to make up the delivery price so i ’d add in loads of other stuff			0
’ he also began to drink up to four litres of @entity4 a day , the equivalent of more than 40 cubes of sugar			1
he said : ‘ i drank enough to warrant sponsorship from @entity4			0
‘ you can get @entity4 points			0
i was n’t that bothered but my housemate loved it because i drank so much he could have my points			0
‘ i was drinking between two and four litres a day			1
‘ you get offers from the supermarket , two 500ml cokes for £ 1.50			0
‘ then you get another one with a meal deal at lunch , then i ’d buy another two litre one and drink that			0
he would also drink a lot of beer and port , usually four or five on regular student nights out			0
after finishing a phd in maths , he moved to @entity189 to work as a software developer , but working long hours meant he still relied on processed food from the company canteen and ready meals in the evenings			1
he said : ‘ when i started at the company i ’d skip breakfast , then i ’d go for a full @entity13 with my team in my break			1
‘ they had everything in it : bacon , sausages , fried eggs , the standard			0
‘ they did have healthy options like porridge but i never went for that			0
’ ' the motivation to lose weight came when he realised his high @entity212 meant he was classified as obese and his gp made a remark about his weight			1
after getting fit , mr @entity8 was able to run a 10km assault course race in one hour and 17 minutes , raising £ 150 for charity he said : ‘ i had a pain in my knee , an annoying twingy pain			1
‘ the doctor said “ you could do with losing a few pounds ” ' he did n’t say “ you ’re going to die ”			2
' but i joined the gym the next day			1
i ’d been thinking about losing weight for a while , but now i thought i was actually going to do it			2
' he began running on the treadmill , going to the gym every other day			1
a friend ’s jibes gave him the motivation to keep going			0
he said : ‘ one of my friends and i would always have banter			0
‘ we ’d argue to the bitter end about different things			0
‘ but at the end of the argument , if he was losing he would always say “ yeah but i can run faster than you			2
” ‘ when i started training i wanted to prove him wrong			2
’ delighted to be offered a job as a research assistant at his old university , mr @entity8 moved back to @entity9 in june to start work			1
he also discovered military fitness bootcamps			1
he said : ‘ i thought bootcamps were where people ran around in gymnasiums			2
mr @entity8 has now been pursued by a girl for the first time			1
he said : ‘ now one girl pestered me			2
i did n’t have in my head how to deal with the situation because i ’d never had that before ' ‘ but it was intense			0
there was this massive bodybuilder in this skin tight t - shirt			0
‘ he was the instructor			0
he ’s from the @entity263 and has a booming @entity265 accent			0
‘ the warm up involved four lengths of a 100m sprint			0
‘ at the time i was thinking about making the gap between me and the back of the group smaller			2
‘ that was just the warm up			0
‘ then we had to run through marshland			2
we did all sorts : 20 press ups , 20 star jumps			0
‘ i said to myself if i could complete one of these classes it was an achievement			2
‘ i dragged myself through			0
’ he began to attend the bootcamps twice a week , and carried on going to the gym on other days			0
soon he had moved from the blue ‘ beginner ’ bibs at the military fitness class to the red ‘ intermediate ’ group who carry out more repetitions			1
he changed his diet , cutting out ready meals in favour of sandwiches , soups and fruit			1
he began to make small changes such as walking to work , taking different routes to increase the calories burned and tracking his fitness using his smartphone			2
on a recent holiday to a remote island near @entity305 he was even able to walk an hour each day carrying ten litres of water , a far cry from when he struggled to walk 500m			1
he was also able to run a 10km assault course race in one hour and 17 minutes , raising £ 150 for charity			1
mr @entity8 changed his diet , cutting out the ready meals , full @entity13 breakfasts he used to eat in favour of sandwiches , soups and fruit his dramatic change in appearance also saw him pursued romantically for the first time			1
he said : ‘ i was lucky – i was never bullied about my weight			2
i was always confident giving talks , i was the big confident guy			2
‘ i had a couple of girlfriends growing up , but i would n’t be confident approaching girls i liked			0
‘ now one girl pestered me			2
she was always around wanting to chat			0
‘ i did n’t have in my head how to deal with the situation because i ’d never had that before			0
' becoming more healthy has given him a renewed sense of purpose and wellbeing			0
he said : ‘ i feel more content now , there ’s this huge sense of purpose			0
‘ i ’d procrastinated about myself and my health for too long			0
' i ’ve realised , if you experiment with fitness tracking , tweak things , you find something that might work for you			2
‘ with all the apps , it ’s become convenient to be healthy			0
‘ it ’s great , and it ’s only going to get better			0
