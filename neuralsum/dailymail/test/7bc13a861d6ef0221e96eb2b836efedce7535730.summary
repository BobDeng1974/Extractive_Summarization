@entity1 programmes are set to move online as part of a new ' internet first ' strategy designed to compete with web services such as @entity5 and @entity6			1
corporation bosses fear they could be losing younger viewers who are used to watching video online rather than through their tvs , and are promoting digital services in a bid to tackle the problem			1
but the revelation could spark controversy over the future of the licence fee , because viewers are currently able to use the @entity1 's online services without paying for them			1
going digital : popular tv shows such as @entity23 could one day be migrating to the web as part of @entity1 plans to become an ' internet first ' broadcaster @entity28 , the @entity1 's chief technology officer , said in an interview that the corporation needs to remain ' relevant ' to a new generation of viewers			1
' it 's my job over the next five years to put in place the production foundations to be internet first , ' he told the @entity38			0
he added that traditional media groups such as the @entity1 would have to ' learn lessons ' if they want to ' compete with organisations that were born in the digital age ' , which are not tied to the methods used to produce broadcast tv			1
online services such as @entity5 and @entity6 have increasingly been producing their own programmes in a bid to take on major broadcasters , while catch - up services including @entity50 have been growing in popularity			0
@entity5 has won plaudits for shows such as @entity55 and @entity54 , which can only be watched by subscribers who access the service through their computer , tablet or internet - enabled tv			2
hit : @entity61 is another popular @entity1 show which could be affected by the ' internet first ' plan popular : but shows such as @entity66 , pictured , have lost viewers thanks to the rise of the internet the rise of catch - up tv , as well as the proliferation of digital services , has caused audiences to shrink dramatically - for example , the remake of @entity23 starring @entity71 attracted 6.9million viewers for its first episode , less than half the number who tuned in to the original series 40 years ago			1
while other programmes such as @entity66 and @entity61 remain popular , primetime audiences are still much smaller than the highs they reached before the advent of the internet			0
@entity28 was appointed the @entity1 's chief technology officer on a salary of £ 225,000 - more than the prime minister - in july last year			1
he was previously head of @entity1 research and development , working on digital projects including high - definition internet broadcasts			1
mr @entity28 was also involved with developing the @entity50 , and was at one point in charge of the corporation 's mobile services			2
he was educated at @entity99 , and worked as a telecommunications consultant before joining the @entity1 in 2003			2
mr @entity28 was appointed last year on a salary of £ 225,000 to pick up the pieces after the failure of the £ 100million @entity104 , which was scrapped by director - general @entity105			0
the strategy was designed to streamline all the @entity1 's online services and give its staff access to the corporation 's whole archive at once , but it collapsed in 2013			1
technology chief @entity111 was sacked over the fiasco , but last year he successfully sued the @entity1 for unfair dismissal			1
mr @entity28 told the ft : ' rather than trying to deliver one large project , we 've been taking off the different components and moving forward			0
' last year it was announced that @entity118 , the youth - oriented digital tv channel , will be taken off the air and become internet - only			2
the move could herald a new wave of services moving to the internet - but mr @entity28 insisted that other channels will remain on broadcast tv for the time being , saying : ' @entity118 was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily			1
' mr @entity28 also predicted that more and more @entity1 services will be consumed via mobile phones and tablet computers rather than on traditional channels			1
he wrote in a blog post last night : ' we will increasingly use the internet to deliver programmes and services to you in the future - whether that 's to the big screen in the living room or the smartphones and tablets scattered over the house			2
' @entity149 , which is also aimed primarily at young people , has expanded its online offerings via sites such as @entity154 - controller @entity153 said last month that it was ' no longer a music station ' but a ' multi-platform youth music brand '			0
future : the @entity1 has increasingly been promoting its services on digital platforms such as @entity50 figures released in november showed that children spend half as much time as adults watching ordinary broadcast tv , but much more time watching online video			1
if the trend continues , the television licence fee could be under threat as viewers opt out of the £ 145.50 payment and watch online instead			1
it is thought that around 500,000 people take advantage of the so - called ' iplayer loophole ' , but that figure is likely to rise if more @entity1 services become online - only			2
mps recently called for the licence fee to be amended so that viewers who only use catch - up services will have to pay it			1
mr @entity28 said in a statement today : ' i 'm not talking about the @entity1 only putting its content online			2
my role is to make sure that the @entity1 ’s technologies that underpin everything we do - from our newsroom infrastructure and new in - the - field production and editing tools , to how we keep the @entity1 on air and online - are set up in the best possible way , and take advantage of new internet - based technologies			1
' when the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) was launched in 2008 , it was hailed by @entity1 chiefs as ' the single most important initiative we are working on '			2
but before a year had elapsed , it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as ' do n't mention it			0
' the @entity1 originally appointed it firm @entity200 to implement the scheme			0
but it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in - house			0
by then , £ 26million had already been wasted but it is understood the @entity1 later recouped the cost from @entity200			0
in february 2011 , the @entity206 condemned the corporation over its handling of the @entity104 after it ran 21 months behind schedule			0
the public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated			0
the @entity213 criticised the @entity1 for awarding the contract to @entity200 without putting it out to open tender			0
the project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material on their computers			0
as hundreds of staff moved to the corporation 's new headquarters in @entity226 , this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from @entity231 , reducing production costs			0
but the costs of the project continued to spiral to £ 98.4million until it was finally halted in may 2013 .			0

@entity1 is aiming to compete with internet services which have captured younger generation of viewers
new technology boss vows to make the corporation ' internet first '
but the move will raise questions over the future of the tv licence fee
