should scientists make the dreams of a million @entity4 fans come true by designing a spacecraft capable of travelling faster than the speed of light , it would be pretty frustrating to discover such a ship would obliterate any planet it landed on			1
but that is exactly what @entity11 researchers suspect could happen after new analysis revealed a flaw in designs for a so - called ' warp drive ' - the theoretical technology that would propel spaceships to speeds faster than light - could cause catastrophic explosions the moment intrepid space explorers reached their destination			1
rocket scientists at the @entity26 have been researching the possibility of a spaceship that could achieve warp speed travel via a real - life warp drive , the fantasy version of which is familiar to fans of @entity4 and other sci - fi shows			1
world of possibility : a so - called warp drive system could propel spacecraft like the @entity37 to speeds faster than light equations based on the laws of relativity have allowed warp speed in theory ; but the energy required to make it happen would require the energy - mass of a planet the size of @entity49			2
recently scientists studying the model for a warp drive proposed by the @entity54 physicist @entity53 concluded its power requirements were not as impossible as once believed			0
but new research from the @entity58 has suggested that , while the warp drive could work , disengaging the system at the end of a journey could prove extremely problematic			0
bad news @entity63 : warp drive technology featured in the @entity4 series and other science fiction shows @entity53 's design features a ship made of a central pod surrounded by a large , flat ring - scientists are yet to establish what matter this ring would be made of , as it would need to be capable of bending the very fabric of the universe			1
nonetheless they claim that , with enough energy , space and time can be bent to allow the spacecraft to travel through ' loops ' in space			2
warp drive : this design for a warp drive system features a central pod surrounded by a large flat ring when activated , space behind the drive would expand while that in front of the drive would contract			0
in the meantime the ship would travel in a stable ' pocket ' , or ' bubble in space ' , according to extremetech.com			0
potential death star : a real - life warp drive could vaporise entire planets upon arrival , scientists say but the @entity104 research indicates that the high - energy particles that are constantly shooting around space could get swept up in the ship 's warp field and become trapped in the ' bubble ' , with more and more of the particles filling the stable pocket the longer the journey lasts			1
while this would no affect the drive 's ability to achieve warp speed , the instant it is disengaged that space - time gradient allowing it to move faster than light - and creating the bubble that holds the dangerous build - up of trapped particles - is gone			2
researchers now believe those particles would be blasted out in front of the ship , destroying anything around it			0
in theory , a long trip powered by a warp drive could see entire planets vaporised upon arrival			1
a lack of ability to reach light speed travel places limitations on fantasies of exploring the stars			0
while nothing can break the speed of light , scientists have long been fascinated by theories surrounding warp - speed travel .			0

real - life version of the technology featured in @entity4 could cause a spacecraft to explode after propelling it through space to a *distant* planet
*resulting* blast could vaporise entire planets , according to new research
