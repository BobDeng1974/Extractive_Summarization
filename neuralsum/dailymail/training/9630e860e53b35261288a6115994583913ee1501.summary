by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 1 may 2013 a renowned microsculptor has crafted what may be the world 's smallest ever piece of art - inside a hollowed - out strand of hair			1
@entity8 created his tiniest work to date using a microscopic flake of gold from a chain and a speck of his own stubble			1
the steady - handed artist brushed his face after a shave before working on the dot of hair which had become embedded in his fingerprint			2
using microscopic fragments of diamond which he adapted into a tool , mr @entity8 spent 16 hours a day over a five - week period producing the remarkable piece at his studio in @entity41			2
the chopper - which measures just 3 microns - is smaller than a human blood cell and only visible through a microscope			1
it is so small that even the pulse in his finger could have crushed the sculpture altogether			0

' i wanted to go beyond human expectations - but i wanted to personally challenge myself			2
' it drove me mad to do			0
i burst a blood vessel in my eye staring so hard through the microscope , ' said mr @entity8 ' i dabbed my finger on my chin after shaving and took the tiniest piece of stubble in between my fingerprint			2
