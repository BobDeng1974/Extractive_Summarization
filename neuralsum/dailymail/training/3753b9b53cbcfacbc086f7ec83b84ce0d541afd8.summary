we just love pubs and everything about them			2
' we have our own score cards which we fill in and we write the number of the pub on the card and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every bar we go to			2
' we also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub , inside and out , and make a note of anything special about the place			2
' it turned from a bit of fun to a serious hobby			0
i 'll be doing this for as long as i can - i intend to visit every pub i can			2
