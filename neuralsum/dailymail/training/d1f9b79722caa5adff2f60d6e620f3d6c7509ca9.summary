@entity2 's booming @entity1 scene is littered with failed start - ups that tried to take on @entity4 and other entrenched @entity6 web companies			1
but that 's not deterring a newly launched @entity10 - @entity9 outfit which believes it can unseat the @entity6 search engine in this fast - growing @entity13 market and also contend with a jittery , authoritarian government seeking to clamp down on freedom of expression online			1
like @entity4 rivals elsewhere , @entity17 , or ' @entity18 ' in @entity19 , believes the ubiquitous search engine does n't get the nuances of the local language			1
it says its algorithms make for a better , quicker search in @entity9 , while its local knowledge means the information served will be more relevant - and hence more valuable			1
competition : @entity17 has spent $ 10million and employed 300 staff at its headquarters in the capital of @entity2 , @entity34 fast - growing market : @entity17 is hoping to unseat @entity6 giant @entity4 as @entity13 's search engine of choice @entity17 also flags another possible vulnerability ; @entity4 has no office or staff in @entity2			1
the company , whose code of conduct includes the phrase ' do n't be evil ' , is concerned about the liability it faces over content hosted on its servers and having to cooperate with censorship requests by @entity2 's authoritarian , one - party government			2
unlike other past hopefuls , @entity54 is not short of cash			2
the company has so far spent $ 10 million , hired 300 staff - including 30 foreigners , mostly @entity10 - and spread itself out over four floors of a downtown office block in the @entity9 capital			1
according to @entity17 's founders , its investors have $ 100 million over the next five years to try and get a chunk of the 97 percent of @entity9 web surfers who currently use @entity4 to switch			1
they declined to name the investors			0
' when i came here , i had some understanding why @entity2 was a good market to beat @entity4 , ' said @entity70 , the company 's chief search expert and like others in @entity54 , a veteran at @entity10 's largest internet company , @entity74			1
' but after living here for one year , i understand the language and market much more deeply			0
i 'm sure it 's right			0
' close to a third of @entity2 's 90 million people are online and men and women browsing phones and tablets are a common sight in the cafes of its towns and cities			0
the country 's potential for growth , its young population and good internet infrastructure have made it an attractive destination for regional and international investors and startups in online content , e-payment and other services			0
@entity18 : the firm is contending with an authoritarian government seeking to clamp down on freedom of expression online companies , however , have to factor in legal and political uncertainties			2
shaken by an explosion in online dissent , the government is drafting laws that would tighten freedom of expression on the @entity1 and possibly force companies such as @entity4 to keep their servers inside the country			2
it routinely blocks and filters sensitive sites , sentences bloggers to long jail terms and is alleged to be involved in hacking attacks on websites critical of the ruling party			0
@entity123 , a lecturer in @entity13 internet studies at @entity2 in @entity125 , wondered whether @entity17 might be more willing to censor search results on behalf of the government , something @entity130 search engine @entity128 does for @entity132			1
while not as close as they once were , @entity10 and @entity2 have a special relationship because of their shared ideological history			2
' if a player like @entity54 came in , or @entity128 , and said " hey we are perfectly happy to filter whatever you want us to filter " and in return they would get preferential treatment from the government , that could put @entity4 in very tough spot , ' he said			1
but there is so far no sign that @entity54 is prepared to play the role of @entity34 's favorite @entity1 son			1
test searches for politically sensitive terms such as @entity152 , the overseas pro-democracy group that @entity34 regards as terroristic , were comparable with @entity4 's and did n't hint at censorship			1
yet the sensitivities surrounding the topic were apparent when one of @entity17 's three cofounders , @entity159 , was asked whether the company would censor searches if asked			2
after a minute of silence punctuated by an occasional ' um ' , @entity159 came up with an example of a search request that might not be honored : someone tapping in ' @entity125 ' , the founder of @entity2 's @entity163 and the focus of a state - manicured personality cult , and ' is a dog '			0
' a lot of queries like that are made by politically - interested people , ' he said			0
' average people are caring about more simple things like how can i find information about my life			0
in some cases , if they really want to go for that kind of information , we can offer them alternative search engines , ' he said , without elaborating			0
in a statement , @entity4 said it welcomed the competition @entity17 represented and it hoped to bring more products and services to @entity2 in the future			1
it said that for the moment it had nothing to announce regarding the opening of an office in the country			0
separately , it announced last week that it was launching @entity198 , its popular advertising network , in @entity2			0
fledgeling firm : the start - up is hoping to attract a chunk of the 97 per cent of @entity9 web surfers who currently use @entity4 to search the internet @entity4 and @entity128 were fighting over the search market in @entity130 until 2010 , when @entity4 shifted its search engine to @entity209 after a reputation - bruising dispute with @entity132 over censorship			1
@entity128 is now the dominant search engine in @entity130			1
@entity128 has a language laboratory in @entity215 and is believed to be looking to expand into other @entity13 markets , but it is not involved in the search market in @entity2			1
anti-beijing sentiment has left @entity130 web companies facing consumer boycotts in @entity2 that make it hard to launch products			0
@entity159 's parents lived in @entity10 when he was growing up , and like the other two @entity9 founders he studied in @entity226			1
the company 's ethos reflects both countries , and in its relaxed office space something of the @entity233 - style tech startup : cutoff jeans , laptops on laps , fish tanks , and as per @entity9 culture , shoes off before you go in			2
@entity4 dominates search across the globe , but there are a handful of markets in eastern @entity245 and @entity13 where it trails local companies , such as @entity248 in @entity10 , @entity128 in @entity130 and @entity249 in @entity250			1
in most cases , the local companies were entrenched before @entity4 entered			0
capturing existing market share from the @entity6 giant is a far more difficult task			0
challenge : the firm 's relaxed office space in @entity34 resembles a @entity233 - style tech start - up ' i 'm sceptical they can do it , but they are spending a ridiculous amount of money , ' said @entity266 , an editor at @entity267 , an online publication that reports on the tech industry			1
' @entity2 as a country is a pretty hard place to do business unless you are here			0
there are a few things that @entity4 ca n't keep up on			0
' @entity54 's hopes lie in the distinctiveness of @entity9 , which it believes @entity4 does n't do such a good job with because it has n't invested in understanding its grammar and syntax			1
search engines that can recognize nuanced and complex sentences can deliver better and potentially more valuable search results			0
@entity17 believes its large office means it is better placed for marketing , cutting deals with content providers and making its search results more localized			2
its camera crews are already filming and photographing streets and logging shops , cafes and businesses - data that will makes search results far richer			0
@entity4 ca n't deploy its ` street view ' vehicles in the country as it has done elsewhere in @entity13			2
' @entity4 is a foreign company , and they are not here , ' said @entity159			2
' we can serve the interests of the local market better			0

@entity17 - or @entity18 in @entity19 - is a @entity10 - @entity9 start - up
hoping to unseat @entity4 search engine in fast - growing @entity13 market
company has spent $ 10million and hired 300 staff in @entity34 headquarters
@entity4 has said it welcomes competition @entity54 represents
