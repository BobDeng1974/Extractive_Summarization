by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 12 september 2013 he never uses a safety net , and of course , he ’s unable to carry a pole			1
but today , ladies and gentlemen : step right up for @entity7 , the collie who never wobbles			2
the four - year - old cross - ozzy for short - has rightly claimed his place as @entity13 ’s most accomplished canine tightrope walker			2
for the record , he crossed a 3.5m ( 11.4ft ) rope in 18.22 seconds			2
the rare feat is just one of @entity10 ’s many remarkable acrobatic acts , which also include swinging on a chain , freerunning along a narrow ledge , or balancing on his owner @entity49 ’s shoulders as he cycles into town			2
for the avoidance of doubt , by the way , it ’s @entity49 who does the cycling , not @entity10 - although it is surely only a matter of time before this particular dog masters two - wheel travel			0
@entity10 , a chocolate and white border collie and kelpie cross , was born on a farm in @entity65 , @entity66 , before moving to @entity49 ’s home in @entity68			0
he showed an early aptitude for balance and seemed keen to improve on that tired old repertoire of standard doggy tricks , such as shake - a - paw and fetch - a - stick			0

he ’s most happy when he ’s working on the tricks that we do - he regards it as a game			0
' we only practice when @entity10 is in the mood , after he ’s done all his important dog stuff like sniffing around and meeting other dogs			0
’ they might not rank among mankind 's greatest achievements , and most of them certainly wo n't change the world			1
but there has always been a place in public 's quest for knowledge of the biggest , the best , the bonkers and the bizarre			1
who could possibly sleep , for example , without knowing what the fastest time is for running the 100 meters in high heels ? that will be 14.531 seconds , actually , clocked by leggy blonde @entity128 in @entity129 last year			0
