@entity63 affects a person 's white blood cells			0
white blood cells are the important infection - fighting part of the immune system , made in your bone marrow			1
patients with leukaemia produce an abnormal number of immature white blood cells which ' clog up ' their bone marrow			1
this stops bone marrow making other blood cells , which are vital for a balanced immune system and healthy blood			1
acute leukaemia comes on suddenly , progesses quickly and needs to be treated urgently			2
chronic leukaemia develops more slowly , over months or years			2
common treatments for leukaemia include chemotherapy , radiotherapy or a bone marrow transplant			1
it is predicted that 48 % of men and 44 % of women will survive the disease for ten years or more			0
