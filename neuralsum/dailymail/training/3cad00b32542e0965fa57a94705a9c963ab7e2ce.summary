by @entity0 couples should be able to get a divorce simply by signing a form at the register office , the country ’s most senior family law judge said yesterday			1
sir @entity7 also backed fault - free divorce , which would mean neither party would have to take legal blame for the breakdown of a marriage			1
in a radical package of reforms to the laws on divorce and relationships , he said consenting couples should no longer need the approval of a judge to end their marriage			1
couple wanting to end their marriage should be able to divorce at a registry office , according to sir @entity7 instead their break - up should simply be recorded by a registrar in the same way as births , marriages and deaths			1
and he said the grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour should disappear from the statute book			0
in a speech to fellow judges he said : ‘ has the time not come to legislate to remove all concepts of fault as a basis for divorce and to leave irretrievable breakdown as the sole ground ? ’ sir @entity7 , who as @entity45 is the head of the courts that deal with family break - ups and custody of children , also called for a cohabitation law to protect women who face ‘ the scrapheap ’ after parting with a man they have lived with for years but never married			1
such a law would see live - in couples treated as married people in the eyes of the law once they have shared a home for a set period of time			2
government advisers have already suggested a live - in couple should be bound by law after two years if they have children and five if they do not			2
but critics said the proposed divorce and cohabitation laws would be open to abuse and hard to operate			2
sir @entity7 also backed fault - free divorce , which would mean that no husband or wife would have to take legal blame for destroying their marriage after his speech , sir @entity7 told journalists : ‘ there are countries where the system is that a divorce which is by consent and where there are no children is treated as an administrative matter dealt with by what , using our terminology , one might describe as the registrar of births , deaths , marriages and divorces			1
’ he said he ‘ would not contemplate it in cases other than cases where there is consent and cases where there are no children of the family ’			0
sir @entity7 said the process of deciding where the children of separated parents should live has already been ‘ uncoupled ’ from divorce , and he hoped the system for dividing up goods and setting maintenance payments could be similarly detached from the legal declaration of the divorce itself			1
current divorce law dates from 1969 , when liberal reforms introduced elements of a no - fault system , but said couples must wait for a divorce on grounds of separation alone he acknowledged that he has not discussed his plans with ministers , but said his proposals ‘ would make divorce no easier than it is at present ’			2
he added : ‘ all one is doing is actually bringing a bit of intellectual honesty to the situation and getting rid of an unnecessary process which simply makes life more complicated			0
’ any changes to divorce law would need parliamentary legislation to be drawn up and pushed through by the justice secretary			0
ministers have indicated that present justice secretary @entity140 will not consider divorce reform before the election			0
yesterday , lawyers and family researchers warned that sir @entity7 ’s proposals are fraught with risk and difficulty			1
@entity148 , author of a study on the collapse of marriage , @entity152 , to be published shortly , said : ‘ it would be the end , the demolition , the abolition of marriage			0
‘ these ideas would mean an end to any declaration of public commitment by a couple			0
‘ they would open the door to the monster state , which would arrange your affairs and divide your money whether you like it or not			0

sir @entity7 says couples should divorce at a register office
added people should no longer need approval of a judge
backed idea of a fault - free divorce meaning nobody takes blame
but critics say proposals would be open to abuse
