@entity1 files detailing @entity3 rendition flights on @entity5 territory have been accidentally destroyed , a minister said last night			1
@entity7 claimed that documents about @entity10 prisoners flown in and out of the @entity5 island of @entity12 had been ‘ water damaged ’			1
recent reports suggest the tiny territory in the @entity16 will be identified as the location of a secret prison used as part of the rendition programme , in a forthcoming report by the @entity22			1
this has always been denied by the government			2
island : the documents focus on flights to and from @entity12 , a tiny territory in the @entity16 rendition is the practice of taking terror suspects to be interrogated in other countries with less stringent human rights regulations			1
it was said to have been used to allow the torture of suspects			0
in 2008 , @entity37 , the then foreign secretary , had to admit that @entity12 had been used twice in 2002 for re-fuelling of rendition flights in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks			1
overthrown : colonel @entity41 in 2009 ministers have consistently denied prisoners ever left the plane or set foot there			0
but since then there appear to have been more flights			0
documents uncovered after the overthrow of @entity51 in @entity52 in 2011 suggest the @entity10 sought to use @entity12 as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of @entity55 , a leading @entity51 opponent , and his pregnant wife			1
the pair are taking legal action against @entity60 , which is also being investigated by @entity61			0
mr @entity7 , a @entity62 minister in the @entity1 , said in response to a written parliamentary question that files on flights in and out of the territory from 2002 – which could have implicated @entity5 officials – were ‘ incomplete due to water damage ’			2
the admission is particularly embarrassing given mps are demanding the @entity71 urgently provide more information about 114 ‘ missing ’ files that could have contained information about an alleged child abuse network in the 1980s			0
@entity76 , director of the charity reprieve and lawyer for mr @entity55 said : ‘ it ’s looking worse and worse for the government on @entity12			2
first we learn the @entity22 ’s upcoming torture report says detainees were held on the island , and now – conveniently – a pile of key documents turn up missing with “ water damage ? ” ‘ the government might as well have said the dog ate their homework			1
this smacks of a cover - up			0
’ the island was purchased by @entity5 in the 1960s and all the islanders evicted			0
it has hosted a @entity10 naval base for decades but using it for rendition would still breach international and @entity5 law .			0

documents held details of prisoners flown through island of @entity12
tiny territory in @entity16 is alleged to hold secret rendition prison
suspects ' taken for questioning in countries with *lax* human rights laws '
government always denied this - but claims key files were ' water damaged '
