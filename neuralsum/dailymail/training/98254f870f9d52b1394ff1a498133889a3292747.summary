more than 100 years after the centuries - old practice of foot binding was banned in @entity3 , these are some of the last living women who were subjected to the practice as children			1
once a symbol of beauty and status , foot binding , also known as lotus feet , was carried out in @entity3 since the 10th century , falling out of favour in the early 20th century before it was outlawed in 1911			1
now the last remaining women to have their feet painfully bound in order to prevent growth have been photographed as part of a photography project celebrating their lives			2
' although considered fairly barbaric , it was a tradition that enabled women to find a suitable partner , ' ms @entity30 explained on her @entity42 page			2
' match - makers or mother - in - laws required their son 's betrothed to have bound feet as a sign that she would be a good wife ( she would be subservient and without complaint )			1
' a tradition that started in the @entity35 , it was originally banned in 1911			1
it continued in rural areas until around 1939 whereupon women with bound feet had the bindings forcibly removed by government decree			1
practice : the process was started when women were aged between four and nine before their feet were fully developed and was often carried out during the winter months when the girls ' feet would be numb from the cold process : feet were soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood to soften them and toenails were cut back as far as possible			2
the toes on each foot were curled backwards and then pressed downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke painful : the arch was then broken and the bandages wound around the foot , pressing the toes underneath			0
the feet would be unbound and washed regularly , when the feet would be kneaded to soften them and the bandages reapplied even tighter inspiration : ms @entity30 described her subjects , including @entity88 as ' the most amazing , kind , generous and compassionate women i have ever met ' ' the women in this project are now in their 80s and 90s			2
' in every culture there are forms of body modification that adhere to that cultures ' perception of beauty			0
from @entity101 , @entity102 , breast augmentation , scarring and tattooing , to rib removals , toe tucks and labrets			0
' the women photographed are all peasant farmers living and working in rural areas , far away from the city life where foot binding was used as a display of social status , as wealthy women who did not need to work would have their feet bound			1
status : the women photographed are all peasant farmers living and working in rural areas , far away from the city life where foot binding was used as a display of social status , as wealthy women who did not need to work would have their feet bound desirable : many young girls used foot binding because it was a mark of beauty and were was one of the main avenues for women to find a husband in @entity3 or marry into money resource : ms @entity30 said she hoped that when completed her project would be a useful aid for anthropological studies , and could be used in museum exhibits equivalent ? ms @entity30 said that in every culture there are forms of body modification that adhere to that cultures ' perception of beauty , such as @entity101 , @entity102 , breast augmentation , scarring and tattooing , to rib removals , toe tucks and labrets symbol of pride : women , their families , and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet , with the ideal length , being around 2.75 inches the process tended to be started when women were aged between four and nine , before their feet were fully developed and was often carried out during the winter months when the girls ' feet would be numb from the cold			1

damage : many of the foot bones would remain broken for years , but would start to heal as the girl grew older			0
however they were still prone to repeatedly re-breaking , especially during teenage years when the girl 's feet were soft risk : since they could not balance securely , older women who had bound feet were less able to rise from a sitting position and were more likely to fall and break their hips and other bones controversial : many women who underwent foot binding were left with lasting disabilities , and missionaries working in @entity3 in the last 1800s said the practice should be banned to promote equality between men and women many women who underwent foot binding were left with lasting disabilities , and missionaries working in @entity3 in the last 1800s said the practice should be banned to promote equality between men and women			1
ms @entity30 said she hoped that when completed her project would be a useful aid for anthropological studies , and could be used in museum exhibits			2
' this project documents and celebrates the lives of the last remaining women in @entity3 with bound feet , ' said ms @entity30 , who has spent the past eight years photographing the women			1
' in the past year alone , three of the women i have been documenting have died and i feel it is now imperative to focus on recording their lives before it is too late			0
