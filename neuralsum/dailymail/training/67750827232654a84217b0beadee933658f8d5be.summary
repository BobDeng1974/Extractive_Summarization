powerful new herbicides and modern farming techniques have seen it almost completely wiped from fields , a study has found			1
the flower is now only found on rough ground , hedgerows and in gardens			2
disappearing from @entity5 fields : the red poppy has become one of the nation 's fastest declining plant species @entity19 , which campaigns for the protection of wild plants , found that the poppy is one of more than 500 wild flowers that are now considered threatened or rare in @entity24			1
@entity25 , who wrote the report , said : ‘ despite its iconic status , our symbol of remembrance could face its own battle if action is n’t taken			1
‘ as @entity5 prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity36 , the sad fact is that the much loved red poppy now belongs to our fastest declining group of plants			1
‘ @entity24 ’s farmland is rapidly becoming the domain of a few species where once there was abundant diversity , with increased intensification resulting in wild flowers such as poppy being squeezed out of the landscape			1
iconic : the flower is widely recognised as the symbol of remembrance ‘ of the 1,556 flowers in the @entity5 flora , 580 are considered threatened or rare in @entity24			1
as they disappear , so the colour is wiped from our countryside			0
the @entity57 warned that on average one species of flower is lost from each county every year			1

@entity19 is calling for the @entity73 common agricultural policy ( @entity74 ) to include increased protections for wild flowers			0
‘ when the @entity36 broke out , farmland flowers like poppies , corn buttercups and purple milk vetch were abundant across @entity5			2
today they are still amongst our most loved species but belong to our most threatened group of flowers , ’ the report said			0
‘ many species have gone from prolific to rare within a few decades			0
across the country we are losing species that have been locally present for centuries			0
‘ changes in farming practices , including the increased use of herbicides and inorganic fertilisers , breeding of more competitive crop varieties , seed - cleaning and changes from predominately spring sown cropping to autumn cropping , have taken their toll			2
‘ we hope the government will make the right decision on cap and agri - environment funding			0
‘ negotiations within the @entity73 have reached a tipping point and the next @entity74 is being settled over the forthcoming months			0
it is imperative that environment measures within the @entity107 for @entity24 protect this unrivalled natural and cultural heritage			0

the red poppy has become one of @entity5 's fastest declining plant species
powerful new herbicides and modern farming techniques are to blame
flower is widely recognised as the symbol of remembrance
