at the heart of this powerful network of speculators is the @entity12 - where the haven status allows the rich to build colossal property empires in the @entity3 under cloaked in secrecy			1
in the last year more than £ 7billion of offshore funds has flooded into @entity3 , buying up some of @entity18 's most exclusive and expensive buildings and homes			1

exclusive : properties inside @entity29 , @entity18 's most expensive address , have been bought up by offshore investors who can avoid tax and are driving up prices expensive : flats in one @entity29 can go for more than £ 100million but offshore buyers need not pay stamp duty , inheritance tax and capital gains tax the trend has been highlighted in a joint probe by the @entity42 and the @entity44 based @entity43			1
one group of investors has bought up huge chunks of one @entity29 near @entity48 , dubbed the world 's most expensive address , with purchase prices ranging between £ 3million and £ 136million			2
others have bought up the £ 97million @entity54 development on the @entity55 , the £ 30million ' @entity57 ' building in @entity58 as well as eight homes on @entity60 in @entity61 worth £ 85million			2
economic centre : the beautiful @entity12 ' tax haven status is allowing the rich to buy in secret and make huge sums of money properties like these in central @entity18 are already worth 49 per cent more than in 2009 - five times higher than the increase in the rest of @entity3			1
as well as huge profits , investors using an offshore company also get substantial tax benefits : offshore property investments from the @entity12 are rocketing upwards , reaching £ 3.8billion in the last year , up from £ 2.7billion in 2010 and £ 1.5billion in 2009			1
there have been almost 100,000 of these transactions from abroad since 1999			0

buy : the £ 30million ' ark ' in @entity58 , @entity18 , is also owned from abroad luxury : @entity88 's headquarters , @entity54 house , which stands on the @entity55 , is worth nearly £ 100million and is owned by an offshore company this , in theory , would allow the rich to hide assets from the authorities , launder money from criminal enterprises and avoid tax in the country they own homes in			1
the @entity42 has found that a @entity102 report in 2001 warned of the abuses but the recommendations were rejected by the @entity106 government of the time			0
' @entity108 has decided that ownership of property should be in the public domain			0
the ability of owners to register land and property under names which conceal rather than reveal who they are flies in the face of the principle which parliament established			0
' making sure people must be named would be ' invaluable for law enforcement , regulatory and tax authorities ' , he wrote and ' deter the unscrupulous from putting the proceeds of crime into property assets ' and be ' helpful in tracing bankrupt persons and combating mortgage fraud '			0
' if public policy emphasises privacy above transparency , the greatest beneficiaries are likely to be criminals , ' he added			0
a consortium also bought some of these homes on @entity60 in @entity61 - worth £ 85million they are the epitome of @entity18 luxury but their purchase is part of a mad scramble for @entity18 property in recent years meanwhile the government has already promised to investigate other suspicious practices revealed yesterday			2
tens of thousands of bogus companies are set up in @entity3 and fronted by sham directors dotted around the globe is helping aggressive tax evaders and criminals keep millions			2
an undercover @entity156 probe has exposed the illegal scam after they secretly filmed brokers bragging they had more chance of ' winning the lottery ' than being caught by @entity162			0
tonight 's @entity163 lays bare a network of at least 21,000 of these companies , headed by just a few dozen puppet managers in various obscure countries who are paid just to front the tax fiddle			0
today business secretary @entity169 told @entity42 : ' i can assure you that we will investigate fully any specific allegations and ensure that appropriate action is taken … if we identify a need for further action as a result of that review , we will not be afraid to take it			0
