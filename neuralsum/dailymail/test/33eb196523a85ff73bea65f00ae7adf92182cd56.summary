@entity0 are considering a state - of - the - art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new @entity7 @entity6 franchise			1
the bold design of the new £ 400million stadium , due to be completed for the start of the 2018 - 19 season , could involve a ‘ slide - out ’ grass football pitch with an @entity7 - style synthetic surface housed underneath			1
the option of extra-large changing rooms , to accommodate @entity7 squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game , is also being explored by architects			2
@entity0 are considering sharing their new £ 400m stadium with an @entity7 franchise a spokesman for the north @entity6 club did not rule out the possibility this week , confirming that they are ‘ looking at options ’ in order to ‘ future - proof the design ’			1
the @entity7 is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in @entity6			1
indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at @entity34 this autumn , with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the @entity37 and ready to play again			2
the clash between the @entity39 and @entity40 on october 25 will kick - off at 1.30pm while the @entity47 vs @entity43 game on october 4 and @entity44 vs @entity46 contest on november 1 will both begin at 2.30pm			0
as well as allowing the @entity7 to experiment with a live game on tv at breakfast time in the @entity51 ( 9.30am eastern time ) , teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on @entity37 soil by sunday night			0
@entity0 's new state - of - the - art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018 - 19 season @entity0 ' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the @entity7 than the 90,000 - seat @entity34 if @entity0 press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the @entity7 franchise it would represent a significant blow to the @entity65 , who also see the @entity7 as a potentially lucrative partner for @entity34 , their £ 757m stadium			1
but the @entity7 are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new @entity6 stadium designed with american football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous			1
even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new @entity75 is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which @entity34 boasts			0
@entity34 does have the iconic status that the @entity7 finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium			1
not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline			0
the modern @entity7 stadiums make sight - lines for spectators a priority and the new @entity75 could overcome the problem that is experienced at @entity34 by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch			2
@entity34 has hosted @entity7 regular - season matches since the @entity98 began in 2007 @entity44 ' clash with @entity100 kicked off early , as will all three games at @entity34 later this year retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design			1
@entity104 have played on two : at @entity105 in @entity106 during the 2006 @entity107 and in the @entity108 in @entity109 four years earlier			0
the @entity110 in @entity111 also has a retractable pitch , as does the @entity113 that hosted this year ’s @entity114			0
the advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment , outside , away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface			0
a feat of modern engineering , a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours			0
a spokesman for @entity0 said : ‘ the club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important , therefore , to look at how we future - proof the design , as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium , whilst being conscious of community uses			2
at this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more			0
