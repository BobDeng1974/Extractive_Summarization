by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 24 october 2013 they sound like fairly obvious requirements for any employee , let alone an upholder of the law : do n’t turn up for work drunk ; do n’t have sex on duty ; be honest			1
the police force , however , thinks otherwise			0
so much so , in fact , that those three instructions are to be issued to all officers in a new ten - point code			2
other parts of the code tell police that they should ‘ respect and obey the law ’ , act with integrity at all times and not abuse their positions			1
new code : police officers will have to abide by the new ten - point plan ethics : mrs may used the speech at @entity28 in @entity29 near @entity30 in @entity31 to set out a new code for all police officers the code is to be introduced after a series of scandals which have shaken public confidence in the force , including the @entity40 row and the investigation into the @entity43 disaster			1
but critics said telling officers not to break the law or be corrupt – and reminding them to be courteous to the public – was a ‘ statement of the blindingly obvious ’			1
the draft @entity49 was published yesterday by the @entity51 , which was created up to set and maintain standards for policing in @entity53 and @entity54			1
it was endorsed by home secretary @entity55 , who said it was ‘ astonishing ’ that police had not had an explicit code of ethics before			0
the ten headings include honesty and integrity , courtesy towards the public , and equality and diversity			2
under the latter , officers are told to uphold the @entity69 , while under ‘ fitness for work ’ officers are told to not make themselves ‘ unfit or impaired for duty as a result of drinking alcohol ’ or using drugs			2
the ‘ work and responsibilities ’ section includes an edict to ‘ maintain strictly professional behaviour when on duty , including not engaging in sexual conduct ’			2
officers are also told not to ‘ use your professional position to establish or pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship ’ with a ‘ vulnerable ’ person			0
the @entity89 was given more powers in december 2012 for a probe into the @entity43 the code also includes a new obligation on officers to report or challenge any of their colleagues who fall below the standards of the code			1
chief constable @entity98 , the head of the @entity51 , said : ‘ it ’s right to spell out in plain language what ’s expected of people and also we have to learn lessons from the past			1
’ he added : ‘ we have a code of ethics for doctors , for lawyers for all the serious professions and i do n’t think they say they do n’t need it written down			0
’ he also accepted some individual officers had ‘ let us down ’ in the past with their conduct			0
but critics pointed to the oath which all police constables already have to take			0
in it , they swear to serve the @entity119 with fairness , integrity , diligence and to accord equal respect to ‘ all people ’			0
@entity125 , of @entity126 , said : ‘ are n’t these things that the police are supposed to have been doing on duty since 1829 when the first police force was set up ? do they know something we do n’t that they feel the need to re-state ten points of the blindingly obvious ? ’			0

@entity137 was *unveiled* by the @entity51 yesterday
comes after *warning* that public confidence has been hit by scandals
includes *guidance* for officers to ' respect and obey the law '
