by @entity0 a daughter , who was told her father was ' having a cup of tea ' while he was slowly bleeding to death in a busy accident and emergency unit , only discovered the poor level of care he received five months after his death			1
@entity12 veteran @entity11 , 70 , was admitted to @entity13 in @entity14 in december 2013 suffering from chest pains			1
his daughter @entity16 , 46 , called the hospital and was told that the former @entity19 officer was ' fine ' and was was waiting to be seen			1
@entity11 , left , who spent 25 years in the @entity19 , right , complained of chest pains in december 2013 he was admitted to @entity13 , pictured , where the seriousness of his condition was missed an anonymous member of staff in the accident and emergency unit complained about the level of care offered by the hospital which led to an internal review			1
five months after his death , ms @entity16 received a letter admitting that the hospital had made mistakes while treating her father			1
mr @entity11 was suffering from internal bleeding and according to the hospital 's own guidelines he should have been seen by a senior doctor and then monitored every 30 minutes			1
mr @entity11 was eventually moved to the hospital 's cardiac ward where he suffered a heart attack			1
he was found unresponsive and in a state of cardiac arrest 15 minutes after arriving on the ward			0
the @entity46 was full at the time of his admission			0
in a letter , the hospital admitted that the incident was a ' serious event ' however the investigation and report was ' not intended to apportion blame but act as ' an opportunity for learning '			2
the investigation found that due to a lack of monitoring , mr @entity11 did not receive appropriate blood transfusions and other fluids in time to save his life			1
no members of staff have been disciplined over the incident and no inquest into the cause of mr @entity11 's death has been held			1
she said : ' i was told at the time he was waiting to be seen , and i was told he was just having a cup of tea and a biscuit			2
' at the time of his death , mr @entity11 's family were unaware that the hospital had failed in their treatment as a result , mr @entity11 's death was not investigated by the coroner and no inquest into the incident has been held eventually she discovered that her father had been recognised as high - risk within 10 minutes of arriving at the emergency department			1
she was told he was given only two bags of blood over the eight hours he lay dying in the emergency care ward			2
he was also unable to go to the cardiac ward after his heart attack because it was full			1
ms @entity16 , a health and safety consultant , said : ' i am still of the opinion that the delay in appropriate action was either entirely or substantially responsible for my father 's death			1
' his heart had stopped because there was n't enough blood left in his body			2
' my family believe the lack of primary intervention and in particular the lack of blood , contributed to his death			2
' i made a decision to put on the @entity111 ( do not resuscitate )			0
in the state he was in , i could n't really make any other decisions			0
' the letter sent to ms @entity16 about her father 's death did n't even mention him by name - forcing her to call in to find out why she was receiving it			1
this first report into his death was deemed so badly written , lacking in detail and error - prone that a second had to be ordered			2
mr @entity11 , right , received a @entity121 from the @entity19 after his 25 years ' service ms @entity16 went in to meet dr @entity123 , the trust 's medical director and heard details of what had happened to her father			1
she said : ' i do n't think i 've ever felt so sick			0
' in an email to dr @entity123 she wrote : ' i can not begin to express my heartbreak , distress , anger , distrust and revulsion			0
' i am appalled that any fellow human being , let alone my own father , can appear to have been overlooked , ignored or downright mistreated			0
' the hospital admitted the incident was a ' serious event ' but said the report was ' not intended to apportion blame ' , and instead it would use it as ' an opportunity for learning '			0
mrs @entity16 said dr @entity123 has been helpful since the first report was released , but added : ' frankly , i do n't think comfort 's going to be found			2
' mr @entity11 joined the @entity19 as a @entity147 in 1961			1
his service ended 25 years later and included a spell as lieutenant commander on @entity151 in the @entity152			0
she was one of the first ships to arrive at the @entity12 and withstood 10 attacks and emerging unscathed earning the nickname ' @entity157 '			2
mrs @entity16 said the stoicism typical of his generation , and many others who serve in the forces , meant he did n't want to cause a fuss or draw attention to himself			2
she said : ' he was a very proud and generous man			0
' he threw himself into things whole - heartedly and would not sit on the sidelines			0
' i 'm fighting this because if @entity168 had survived he would have fought			0
i 'm doing this because he ca n't			0
' nine times out of 10 the @entity170 is brilliant , but when it goes wrong it really goes horribly wrong			0
' ms @entity16 said the hospital should introduce a ' silver advocate ' service to protect elderly patients she added that there should be a ' silver advocate ' who would monitor elderly patients to make sure they were getting the care they needed and were n't suffering in silence			1
dr @entity123 said the hospital had ' reinforced processes ' in place to make sure relatives know if the death of a relative is being investigated			0
he apologised that a second report had to be ordered and said ms @entity16 had been offered ' continual support ' from the trust			1
he added : ' @entity190 already has a number of dementia champions , chaplains and members of the friends charity and volunteers , who help care for and represent elderly patients			0
' providing an additional layer of support for our more vulnerable patients is extremely important and is something the @entity203 is very supportive of			0
' as regards to the idea of " @entity206 " , this is something we intend to look at to see if it would further enhance this support			0
