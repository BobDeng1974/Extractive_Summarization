not since @entity0 swallow - dived his way into @entity3 history 20 years ago has a foreign striker made quite such an impressive entrance into @entity7 football as @entity8			1
it is not just the goal record , which is extraordinary — with a hat - trick and seven goals in four games			1
as with @entity0 , whose scored seven in his first six games , it is the sheer force of personality of the player that has enthralled @entity7 audiences			1
@entity0 's charisma became evident with that self - parodying celebration , diving to mock his reputation for going to ground easily			1
with @entity8 , who faces the biggest test of his short @entity3 career on saturday against champions @entity27 , it is his clear relish for the physical battle that has made such an impact			1
@entity8 scores his side 's second goal during @entity34 's @entity3 match against @entity35 @entity8 scores @entity34 's sixth goal against @entity37 at @entity38 earlier this season @entity39 after scoring for @entity40 against @entity41 with one of his trademark celebrations @entity0 holds off @entity45 midfielder @entity44 during a meeting between the sides in 1997 @entity0 heads home spectacularly for @entity40 against @entity49 during a @entity3 game in 1998 plenty of wonderful players have needed time to adjust to the confrontational ways of @entity7 football before demonstrating their best ; @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 would all fit into that category			1
by contrast , @entity8 , originally @entity61 but a naturalised @entity62 , looks like he was born to play in @entity7			1
defenders might look to be provoke or unsettle him — he has already been involved in spats with @entity37 's @entity66 and @entity67 — but @entity8 genuinely does n't seem to care or even notice			1
' the reality is , for the moment , i have n't had any really physical battles , ' he said , when asked about that side of the @entity3			1
' things have been going well			2
so far , i 'm enjoying it			2
' the provocations ? ' that happens here , it happened in @entity79			1
' wherever i play , it 'll always be like that			0
it 's a perception people have of my character and people will look for any way to try to take advantage of it			2
' they go looking for it			0
you 've got to know how to manage these situations			0
the truth is i 'm fairly relaxed			0
if they provoke me , i 'll score against them ! ' clearly saturday 's test against @entity98 will be the severest yet , with @entity8 's manager @entity99 conceding that playing him with a hamstring problem is a risk			1
@entity8 celebrates scoring his third goal during @entity34 's 4 - 2 over @entity35 at @entity103 @entity8 used his power and strength to hold of @entity107 duo @entity106 and @entity108 but @entity8 seems to be a fighter by nature			1
you suspected as much when he took on @entity112 in the first leg of @entity116 's @entity115 semi-final clash last season , simply staring straight back at him as they squared up			2
then , in the return leg , he gave as good as he got to @entity120 and @entity121 as they reprimanded him for taking an age to place the ball for his penalty , which he duly scored , effectively ending @entity34 's participation in the competition			1
all this at a time when it was fairly clear he would be moving to @entity103			0
even his friends say he is a little crazy			0
' well , i do n't like to lose , i think that gets noticed , ' said @entity8			1
' it 's something that many times goes well but other times goes badly for me			2
' i 'm just like that , i just always try to win , to get better , do my best and it always annoys me to lose			0
' i think anyone in life , everyone in the world , no matter what work they do , should think of wanting to get on , to win , to improve			2
' i do n't think i am the type of person who thinks : ' things are getting on top of me			0
' but it 's not that i think i 'm any different to most people			2
i always fight with all my strength , make the best of a situation			0
' hard to believe now , but @entity8 was ignored by @entity61 clubs and was playing street football without a team until he was 16			1
@entity8 celebrates his strike for @entity116 with his then team - mate @entity160 back in 2010 @entity8 has emerged from @entity160 's shadow , and will line up against the @entity27 striker at the @entity163 on sunday he was briefly at @entity164 , a club in the local reaches of @entity167 semi-pro football , before being brought to @entity168 in @entity169 by agents			1
there his transfer value was eventually part - owned by @entity173 , the company which has @entity174 , @entity99 's agent , as a key player and investor			2
they moved him to @entity116 , where he sat behind @entity160 , his @entity27 rival today , then @entity178 in the @entity116 pecking order			1
he was farmed out on loan to @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 before eventually getting his chance			0
the transformation from being @entity160 's back - up to becoming his direct rival today is fascinating			2
@entity8 said : ' i loved watching him			1
he is , for me , the best i saw play , the best as a teammate			0
he 's one of the absolutely top - level forwards around			2
i knew when he was there , @entity160 was @entity192			0
you knew what a great player he was			0
the truth was i learned a lot with him			0
i hope things keep going well			0
now , we 'll see who comes out on top in this game			0
' another @entity61 , @entity203 , has followed @entity8 to @entity34 from @entity116 and knew him through the leaner years			1
' i played with @entity8 five years ago and his growth has been huge , ' said @entity203			1
' every year he gets better and more confident			0
if you go back in his career and look where he started and how he suffered , he has never needed time to adapt in any place			0
@entity34 fans will be praying that the striker can continue his rich vein of goalscoring form at @entity27 ' he always goes to a club and scores			1
for some players , like me , it is not easy when you get a new club , new team - mates and everything is new , especially the physicality			0
but for @entity8 it 's never difficult			1
' the @entity34 left - back also sees a clear comparison between their manager and his star signing			1
' @entity8 always wants to win and if he does n't he gets crazy , he gets mad			1
he 's that sort of person			2
@entity99 is also likes this			0
' people with ambition , they always want to win and if you do n't , it gets you mad			0
they try to get better and these sort of people really have to succeed in life			2
so even when he spent the early part of his career as second best and sent on loan , @entity8 did n't despair , according to @entity203			1
' he wanted to go			0
he wanted to prove first to himself and then to other clubs that he was a good player and that he deserved his place at @entity116			0
he is a simple person with a big heart			0
sometimes on the field he looks like he is crazy and he has one of the purest hearts i 've ever known so i am proud to be his friend			0
' video we must support @entity254 - @entity253			0

@entity8 has made a superb start to life in the @entity3
the @entity79 *international* has scored seven goals in four games for the @entity262
@entity8 's impact is similar to that of @entity0 when he *joined* @entity40
@entity8 faces his biggest test in the @entity3 to date when @entity34 travel to champions @entity27 on sunday
