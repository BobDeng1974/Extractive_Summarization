by @entity0 and @entity1 it is @entity4 ’s most famous murder mystery and a puzzle that has occupied criminologists for more than a century			0
but modern crime experts think they have finally decoded part of the @entity10 conundrum using a computer algorithm - and suggest detectives may have been very close to solving the murders at the time			1
dr @entity15 , a former @entity16 police officer who has pioneered the use of geographical profiling , thinks he has pinpointed the very street where the @entity10 lived while he was terrorising @entity20 in the autumn of 1888			1
warning : graphic content a former @entity16 police officer who pioneered the use of geographical profiling , thinks the ripper lived on @entity26 and @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity20			1
the bustling street is pictured here in 1902 using mathematical computer models which take the murderer ’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base , dr @entity15 has worked out that the killer probably lived in @entity26 and @entity27			1
it was part of a slum in @entity28 , @entity20			1
' this was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that @entity20 social reformers referred to as the “ wicked quarter - mile , " ' dr @entity15 said			2
all five victims lived in doss houses within 200 yards ( 183 metres ) of the road and frequented the nearby @entity44 at @entity45			1
the street was destroyed in the @entity47			1
using mathematical computer models which take the murderer ’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base , dr @entity15 has worked out that the killer probably lived in @entity26 and @entity27 , a slum area in the @entity28 area of @entity20			1
in 1888 , detectives conducted door - to - door inquiries along @entity26 and @entity27 in the wake of the five murders , but came up with nothing and turned their attention to other areas			1
dr @entity15 , speaking at the @entity59 yesterday , said that each of the five victims had lived in doss houses within 200 yards ( 183 metres ) of the road and had each frequented the @entity44 at @entity45 , which was close by			1
the criminologist , whose geographical profiling techniques are now used by police forces around the world , said : ‘ flower and @entity27 was destroyed in the @entity47 and no longer exists as it used to			1
but in 1888 it lay between @entity69 to the west and @entity71 to the east , north of @entity73			0
@entity26 and @entity27 ( marked ) was destroyed in the @entity47			1
but in 1888 it lay between @entity69 to the west and @entity71 to the east , north of @entity73			0
this map also reveals the locations of each victim 's murder and the @entity81 pub , believed to be where @entity10 used to frequent speaking at the @entity59 yesterday , dr @entity15 said that each of the five victims had lived in doss houses within 200 yards of the road and had each frequented the @entity44 at @entity45 , which was close by ( pictured )			1
the pub as it appeared in 2013 is shown @entity10 murdered five victims in 1888			1
‘ during the time of the @entity28 murders it contained several doss houses			1
‘ this was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that @entity20 social reformers referred to as the “ wicked quarter - mile ”			2
’ using the sites of each of the murders and the location of a scrap of bloody clothing found nearby , dr @entity15 used an algorithm to calculate the likely routes the killer had taken on the days of each murder and his most probable base			1
he found that @entity26 and @entity27 is likely to have been his home , and at the very least would have been a frequent haunt			2
dr @entity15 , who helped @entity107 capture and prosecute serial rapist @entity108 in the 1990s , said : ‘ i would be very surprised indeed if the @entity10 had not had some involvement with @entity26 and @entity27			1
he might have lived there , drank there , picked up prostitutes there , he might have had a relative there			0
there is a high chance it was within his area of activity			0
’ using the sites of the murders and the location of a scrap of bloody clothing found nearby , dr @entity15 used an algorithm to calculate the likely routes the killer had taken on the days of each murder and his most probable base			1
an image of victim @entity129 is pictured left , and a letter purporting to be from the @entity10 ( right ) he said police at the time and ‘ @entity10 ’ since had wrongly built their investigations around their suspects , rather than strictly following the evidence			2
‘ this is one of the biggest cause of wrongful convictions – choosing an early suspect and building a case around that			0
you need to follow the evidence			0
’ but he said the killer , who mutilated his five female victims after strangling them , will now almost certainly never be identified			0
‘ the only way we could find who the ripper is now is if there is a piece of evidence squirrelled away in the @entity153 files , which we might get a piece of dna from			0
you would then need to find a relative to compare it to , it is a very long shot			0
’ he said the @entity10 probably died , was taken into a mental asylum or was imprisoned for another crime – and dismissed theories that suggest the killer was linked to the @entity164			2
using mathematical computer models which take the murderer 's known movements and calculate his likely geographical base , dr @entity15 has worked out that the killer probably lived in @entity26 and @entity27 , a slum area in the @entity28 area of @entity20			1
a still from the 1959 film @entity10 is pictured ‘ this man was almost certainly anonymous			2
his psychological profile suggests he was poor , he lived or worked in @entity28 and he had a menial job			2
he was not an aristocrat			0
’ dr @entity15 , who started his career as a police officer with @entity179 and is now based at the criminal justice department at @entity181 , is working with @entity4 academics to apply his geographical profiling techniques to disciplines of healthcare and wildlife conservation			1
dr @entity187 , a biological mathematician at @entity188 in @entity20 , has refined dr @entity15 ’s computer model to track populations of invasive species , outbreaks of infectious diseases and even mosquito breeding grounds			2
he told the @entity197 audience : ‘ this is genuinely exciting – using these techniques can really make a difference for public health			0
’ detectives investigating crimes including gruesome murders may have a new tool in their crime fighting kit soon as @entity208 forensic experts have discovered how to accurately date fingerprints			2
they think their innovation could let police date crime scene prints from years ago			0
‘ it 's not quite the @entity219 of fingerprinting , but it 's a very important discovery , ’ @entity213 , a fingerprint researcher at the @entity215 ( @entity216 ) , told @entity217			0
‘ being able to date the prints means you can determine when a potential suspect was at the crime scene or which fingerprints are relevant for the investigation			0
’ fingerprints leave nearly - unique marks on a surface that can be copied and compared to a database to identify a suspect - a police technique that rose to prominence in the early 1900s			2
the prints themselves are made up of sweat and grease , including a complex mix of cholesterol , amino acids and proteins			0
‘ the chemicals in these fingerprints can be analysed			0
some disappear over time and it 's the relative proportions of these chemicals that allow us to date a fingerprint , ’ @entity243 said			0
previous attempts to crack the formula for dating fingerprints failed because they focused on the amounts of chemicals , rather than their relative proportions			0
taking into account the temperature of the original prints ' surroundings , which affects the speed of deterioration , forensic experts can now date fingerprints to within ‘ one or two days ’			0
the new technique needs to be extensively tested on real crimes scenes , leading to the creation of a database , before it can be used in prosecutions .			0

a former @entity16 police officer who pioneered the use of geographical profiling thinks the @entity10 lived on @entity26 and @entity27
the street was part of a slum area in the @entity28 area of @entity20
@entity27 was destroyed in @entity47 , but was near the sites of the murders
detectives conducted door - to - door inquiries at the addresses in 1888
each of @entity10 's victims lived in doss houses within 200 yards of the road
expert used sites , the location of a scrap of bloody clothing , and an algorithm to calculate the @entity10 's likely routes on the days of the murders
