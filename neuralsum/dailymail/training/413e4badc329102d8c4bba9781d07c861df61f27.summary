by @entity0 in one sense the @entity1 is a new venture for me because i ’m going to @entity5 as part of the @entity8 team — and honoured to be doing so			1
i ’ve spoken extensively to @entity9 and @entity10 about their tv roles and they say it ’s obviously a different experience but probably the next best thing to playing			2
i can assure you of one thing though : i ’m not quite ready to join the @entity20 retirement club just yet			1
i see myself as going to @entity21 very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me			2
pundit : @entity0 will work for the @entity8 team at the @entity1 this summer dream team : @entity0 will work with the likes of @entity9 , @entity26 and @entity10 it is feasible that in the coming weeks , perhaps even while i ’m in @entity28 , i ’ll make a decision about the next stage in my career , and when that happens i ’ll tell you about it			1
but i have options on the table from several clubs in @entity38 and overseas for next season and i ’m intending to play on if the right situation arises			1
there is , in all honesty , nothing settled yet			2
whatever i do next has to be right for me and my family and i ’m going to take it one season at a time			0
i ’m keeping myself fit and in shape , doing my running and my workouts so i ’ll be ready for whatever new club i join			1
in @entity5 , a country i ’ve never visited before , i ’m sure i ’ll catch up with all sorts of former colleagues and opponents now covering the game			0
but i also want to get out and about and explore , soak up the culture , try the food , hear the music , visit the favelas and get a proper look for myself at the other face of the carnival nation			0
end of the road : @entity0 left @entity65 this summer after 12 years at @entity66 finishing touches : the build up to @entity5 has been overshadowed by society problems and construction delays @entity5 has its well documented social problems and i want to learn about those for myself			1
the poor seem to be getting poorer , and the rich richer			0
thousands have been forcibly removed to make way for @entity1 and @entity76 projects			1
we need to educate ourselves on all this — and i intend to			0
i ’ll have expert guides part of the time in the shape of the @entity83 twins , who live in mountains outside @entity21			0
they ’re going to cook me dinner and we ’re going play volleyball on their court			0
i ’m going to beat them , obviously ; they play all the time but still ca n’t beat my touch			0
the twins are expecting a crazy @entity1 , crazy in a good sense , alive with noise and colour and home hopes			1
the further @entity5 go , the better the atmosphere will be , i ’m sure			0
@entity0 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity102			2
