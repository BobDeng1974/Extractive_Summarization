nobody is more excited than i am to learn that wavy hair is back in vogue			1
as someone who has been battling frizz and wayward natural curl for more than a decade , i have long waited for this moment			1
in fashion circles , they ’ve dubbed the must - have look ‘ the mermaid wave ’ , by which we ’re talking tousled , natural - looking , wavy locks			1
but the long and short of it is that it ’s time to pack away those straightening tongs			1
what we need is a gadget to perfect , not iron out , our curls which is why even ghd , the king of straighteners , has a new curling range			0
‘ the key to perfecting this look is not to make waves or curls look too uniform , ’ says @entity41 , senior stylist at @entity42			1
‘ you do n’t want an @entity48 - style perm			1
you want playful , feminine movement			0
’ but how easy is it to achieve this new look at home ? i ’ve road - tested eight curling tongs and wands to find out which is the best — and @entity41 also gives his verdict			1
@entity58 wicked waver £ 59.99 , markhill.co.uk @entity60 says : this has a heated , corkscrew barrel you wind hair around			1
after waiting for it to heat up , you wrap a section of hair in the grooves , hold for a few seconds and then release			1
you get a loose curl with good staying power but you need to straighten hair first with a brush for a smooth finish			1
has variable heat settings from 120c to 200c			0
@entity76 says : i am not a massive fan of the spiral barrel — if you do n’t get the hair in the grooves , you get a kink in the wave			1
but it ’s easy to use and quick			1
start from the cheek bone for a softer , natural wave that frames the face			1
that way you avoid the dropped perm look			0
ghd @entity90 £ 110 , ghdhair.com @entity60 says : the wand is tapered — it ’s round at the top narrowing to an oval tip — to achieve loose waves			1
works best if you tackle the hair in very small sections , but that means it ’s time consuming			1
twist a small section of hair at the root then wind round the barrel , hold for a few seconds and release			1
comes in a stylish clutch with a heat - resistant mat to rest the wand on , but there ’s only one heat setting			1
@entity76 says : i like wands because they ’re easy to use at home			0
do n’t look in the mirror or you will get in a tangle			0
just split the hair roughly into sections and wind it round			1
practise with the heat off , and keep the wand horizontal to avoid prom hair			2
@entity18 £ 19.49 , leestaffordelectricals.com @entity60 says : this heats up quickly ( just one temperature ) and it ’s very easy to use			2
you just wind sections of hair around the tong , hold for a few seconds and release			2
but if the sections are too small , you get really tight corkscrew curls — a great look for the young but ageing and dated if you ’re the wrong side of 40			0
one for a teen daughter or niece ? @entity76 says : the smaller the tong , the tighter the wave			2
the key here is how you section the hair			2
if you divide it into big sections , this styler is excellent for perfecting a fashionable @entity149 wave			2
if the sections are too small , you ’ll end up with an @entity48 corkscrew perm curl			0
my only gripe is the barrel is rectangular rather than cylindrical which means curls have a slight dent			0
@entity158 £ 69.99 , argos.co.uk @entity60 says : this is designed to dry , smooth and curl the hair			2
there ’s a brush on one side and a heated rotating barrel on the other , so you put sections of wet hair between the two , close it and pull hair through from roots to ends			1
it ’s quite noisy because the barrel is motorised			2
it takes a long time to dry long hair , too			1
i got a flick at the front , but it was hard to achieve a tight curl and impossible to reach the back of my hair			1
@entity76 says : this is like a hairdryer meets tong — and it would be difficult to use on yourself			0
i think it ’s better at straightening than curling , and to dry a head of hair would take ages			1
@entity197 by @entity198 £ 74.99 , richardward.com @entity60 says : this curls hair around a heated barrel using a rotating motor			2
you just put a section of hair in the clamp , starting from the ends , and press rotate			2
the barrel then spins and the hair winds up			2
once the tong is near the roots , there ’s a button to rotate the barrel the other way so you can release the curl , but it ’s hard to find so i got in a tangle a few times			2
my conclusion — best to get a friend to help			0
comes in a heat - resistant bag with heat - resistant glove			2
you can vary the temperature from 80c to 210c			0
@entity76 says : i think the rotating technology is tricky to use if you are trying to curl hair by yourself			2
you ca n’t see the control buttons easily , so i ’d suggest using it like a wand instead			0
wind hair round the barrel by hand and then it works really well as it ’s a good weight , and the barrel is big , so it makes lovely waves and curls			1
@entity241 £ 98 , hershesons.com @entity60 says : this is light to hold , though i found it tricky to master at first			0
using the long clamp , which you open and shut with a lever , you can smooth hair before curling it up which is great for banishing frizz			2
to do this , you put a section of hair in the clamp starting near the root and pull it down along the heated barrel			0
then you wind the hair around the barrel to get a curl			0
it heats up quickly , too , with variable temperature settings from 130c to 230c			0
the curls and waves had real lasting power and were shiny and smooth			0
comes with a heat resistant mat in a stylish drawstring bag			0
@entity76 says : ‘ this has a long cable so you can work round the head easily			0
it ’s suitable for any hair length too — the clamp will give you better control when you are working with shorter hair			1
use a lower temperature for coarse or fine hair			0
thicker hair will need a higher setting for the wave not to fall out			1
@entity282 £ 120 , babyliss.co.uk @entity60 says : when you close this space age looking clamp on a section of hair , it gets sucked into a heated roller chamber and held there			0
you then wait for the timer to bleep so you can release the hair — and there should be a curl			0
but it did n’t work very well on long hair , only achieving a wave at the ends			1
the hair did n’t always get sucked into the chamber either			0
comes with a heat protection mat and has two heat settings and three time settings			0
@entity76 says : this does the job but it ’s quite hard work to line up each section of hair with the gadget so it can be sucked into the ‘ curl chamber ’ correctly			1
best for shorter hair , i ’d say			0
@entity315 £ 89.99 , divapro.co.uk @entity60 says : very easy to use — it ’s like a crimper , only the grooves are much wider so you end up with a @entity322 wave			1
take a section of hair and clamp the waver close to the roots , hold a few seconds and release then continue moving down the hair section linking the waves			0
do n’t leave your hair in for too long to avoid damage			0
it ’s not just a one trick pony — if you clamp the waver shut at the ends of a section of hair , you can wind hair around the outside to get a big barrel curl			1
@entity76 says : this is excellent for achieving a slick , uniform wave if your hair is one length			1
take long sections and crimp , starting near the root			0
work your way down keeping the grooves lined up .			0
