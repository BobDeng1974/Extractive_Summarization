@entity0 is slipping in early voting in key areas of crucial swing states , bolstering the @entity6 campaign ’s claim that greater @entity8 enthusiasm will sweep their man to victory next tuesday			1
but @entity6 held back his criticism of @entity0 on the campaign trail in @entity13 in deference to the aftermath of @entity16 while the president toured devastated areas of @entity19			1
@entity20 traditionally hold a marked advantage over @entity8 in early voting			2
the @entity0 campaign has made early voting a centrepiece of its strategy with celebrities such as @entity27 pleading with @entity28 to cast their ballots before election day and president @entity0 being filmed voting early in @entity31			1
the election campaign continues : an excited crowd snaps away as @entity6 gives a thumbs up during his arrival @entity8 presidential candidate @entity6 speaks during a campaign rally at @entity37 in @entity37 , @entity13 today @entity6 gestures to the crowd in his animated speech with less than one week to go until election day , @entity6 smiles for the cameras @entity6 shakes hands with supporters during the campaign stop in @entity13 the former @entity46 gov. reaches out to greet supporters during a campaign stop at the @entity48 , at the @entity49 , in @entity50 @entity6 arrives at a campaign stop at the @entity48 in @entity52 to a crowd of cheers @entity6 is back to campaigning before the general election on november 6 @entity6 is accompanied by sen. @entity56 , @entity57 and he makes ' the @entity59 ' hand sign during the campaign event in @entity52 @entity6 picks up a baby from the audience as he campaigns at the @entity49 , in @entity50 @entity6 talks with former @entity13 gov. @entity63 as they fly on his campaign plane to @entity52 @entity6 walks to his campaign plane with @entity66 senator @entity56 , 2nd left , @entity66 representative @entity68 , 2nd right and former @entity13 governor @entity63 , right in terms of party registration , @entity20 hold a narrow overall lead of 43 to 41 per cent but are clearly not going to match their 46 to 37 per cent advantage of 2008			1
although @entity0 appeared to make big strides on the first two days of eight - day period for in - person early voting , his pace slowed on monday and tuesday			1
@entity20 netted 73,000 vote from the first two days , but gained 28,000 votes on monday and just 16,000 votes on tuesday			2
in the meantime , @entity8 lead among absentee ballots by 70,000 votes			2
@entity20 won the combined early vote by more than 360,000 in 2008 and currently lead by just 49,000			2
more republicans than @entity20 have voted early in @entity88 , suggesting that the swing state , where @entity0 campaigns on thursday , could be slipping from the president ’s grasp			1
in @entity92 , which @entity0 won by just 14,000 votes in 2008 , @entity6 has cut the @entity20 early voting advantage by 100,000			1
@entity0 has not visited the state since september and @entity20 have privately conceded that he is unlikely to win it			1
in @entity97 , @entity0 is also well behind his 2008 support in the @entity20 stronghold of @entity100 , where he will also campaign tomorrow			1
‘ we 're wildly over-performing in @entity8 @entity105 counties and @entity0 's significantly underperforming in @entity13 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity92 compared to 2008 , ’ a senior @entity6 strategist told @entity102			1
‘ you go county by county and we are very happy where we are			2
we have leads among election day voters and independents			2
the @entity0 campaign is saying it 's a 2008 model			1
@entity0 needs to win independents			1
’ on a conference call with reporters , @entity119 , @entity6 ’s political director , said : ‘ in @entity13 right now about 2.2 million votes have been cast in early and absentee			1
right now as of today only 39,645 more democrats have voted than @entity8			2
when you look at the independent break in each state , they are behind where they need to be going into election day next week			0
‘ we will win election day by double digits in @entity13 so they clearly are in a bad place going into day			0
they have three more days of early vote but they also have four so far where they have not made up any ground			0
’ in @entity107 , in counties that senator @entity105 won in 2008 @entity8 are 11 per up from where they were in 2008			0
in 35 @entity105 counties , turnout is 100 per cent up but this is only the case in 10 @entity0 counties			2
donning more casual attire , @entity0 steps down off his plane as he greets @entity19 gov @entity148 a different side to the campaign : @entity66 president @entity0 is greeted by @entity19 governor @entity148 after he arrives at @entity152 in @entity19 before surveying @entity16 damage today [ caption reassurance : president @entity0 ( left ) hugs marine owner @entity156 ( right ) during a tour of @entity158 , @entity19 , which was badly affected by @entity16 president @entity0 and @entity161 ( @entity161 ) administrator @entity160 walk from the @entity162 to @entity163 today president @entity0 , left , embraces a victim of the storm and right , speaks in a neighborhood after he tours damage done by @entity16 in @entity158 , @entity19 today the @entity6 campaign is increasingly confident it will win in @entity108 , which @entity0 won in 2008 and where his caucuses victory over @entity171 launched him on the way to the @entity162			1
‘ @entity108 is a state where there 's a very clear line of demarcation , ’ @entity119 said			0
‘ democrats tend to vote absentee and @entity8 vote on election day			0
if the @entity20 go into election day with less than a 130,000 lead on partisan registration and independents break , then we will win @entity108			0
’ campaigning in @entity184 , @entity13 , @entity6 avoided his usual ferocious attacks on @entity0 and instead concentrated on his own five - point plan for growing the economy			1
‘ you should know i could not be in this race if i were not an optimist , ’ he said			0
‘ i believe in the future of this country i know we have huge challenges , but i ’m not frightened by them , i ’m invigorated by the challenge			0
we ’re going to take on these challenges we ’re going to overcome them ! ’ @entity6 took care to call for donations to the @entity200			2
earlier , he had donated an undisclosed amount himself , according to his aides			0
‘ if you have an extra dollar or two , send them along and keep the people who are in harms – who have been in harm ’s way , who ’ve been damaged either personally or through their property , keep them in your thoughts and prayers ’ he said			0
‘ we love all of our fellow citizens			0
we come together in times like this and we want to make sure that they have a speedy and quick recovery from their financial and in many cases , personal loss			0
but @entity6 did indirectly criticise @entity0 for his handling of the economy			1
‘ my view is pretty straight forward and that is i believe that this is time for @entity66 to take a different course , that this should be a turning point for our country , and i say that because i look at where we are and with 23 million @entity66 – you think about that , ’ he said			0
‘ these are real people			0
these are folks trying to put food on the table			0
23 million people struggling to find a good job			0
this is something that requires in my view a different path than we ’ve been on			0
’ @entity0 will return to the campaign trail on thursday with events in @entity248 , @entity97 and @entity88 while @entity6 will campaign in @entity106			1
@entity6 sits with former @entity13 gov. @entity63 , left , rep. @entity68 , right , and sen. @entity56 , second from right , as they fly on his campaign plane to @entity52 , @entity13 the younger brother of former @entity66 president @entity252 and son of @entity252 , @entity63 joined @entity6 on the campaign trail today @entity63 , @entity6 , rep. @entity68 and @entity66 sen. @entity56 pose for a photo on the tarmac after a campaign rally at @entity37 with less than a week to go until the election the foursome greet supporters at @entity37 @entity6 , @entity262 , @entity56 and @entity63 step down from @entity6 's campaign jet while canvassing votes in @entity13 @entity6 was joined onstage by @entity262 , @entity56 and @entity63 while addressing supporters at the @entity49			1
