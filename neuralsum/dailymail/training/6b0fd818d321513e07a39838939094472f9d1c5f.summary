four - four - two be or not to be , that is the question			1
the other question , of course , is can @entity3 help @entity4 win the @entity5 ? top coaches from the best academies in @entity4 descended upon the @entity9 streets of @entity10 to discover how acting is taught at the @entity12			1
there were workshops about stage - fighting , lessons in voice projection , stage presence , posture and body language and they had a chance to quiz the team behind a production of @entity24 , before watching them perform			1
some of @entity4 's top academy coaches have been expanding their horizons to improve themselves this much ado about coaching is all part of the @entity32 ’s long - term quest to develop more and better homegrown footballers by focusing on the creation of elite environments			1
these same select coaches have also visited @entity37 at the @entity38 , the @entity40 - training base for many @entity41 - and @entity42			1
next they are off to meet the @entity43 and the @entity45 team			2
it is about taking them out of a comfort zone and challenging them to expand their minds beyond the confines of football			2
‘ football has been happy to be comfortable , ’ said @entity54 , who played for @entity55 and now coaches @entity57 ’s under - 13 team			1
‘ other sports looked outside for information and research but football did n’t			2
this has opened doors for us to evaluate what we do , compare it others and refine our approach			2
’ the coaches took part in workshops at the @entity12 to improve vocal skills all ’s well that ends well at international level , too , where innovative coaching at club level is clearly rubbing off on the players of the future			1
@entity78 20s the @entity4 under 20s won a @entity80 in @entity81 in october , beating @entity81 and @entity82			1
@entity78 19s @entity83 beat @entity84 3 - 0 , @entity85 8 - 0 and @entity86 4 - 2 in @entity88 qualifying in october ( in @entity85 )			1
@entity78 18s @entity89 beat @entity81 twice , 4 - 1 and 3 - 1 at @entity90 and @entity91 on sept 3 and sept 5			1
@entity78 17s @entity92 won the @entity88 in @entity93 in may			1
the coaches were surprised to find plenty of common ground with the actors at the @entity12 , who discussed stage fright , coping with audience reaction and the balancing of individual expression and direction			1
it was a far cry from @entity105			2
‘ @entity106 talked about the muscles in the tongue , projecting your voice and enunciating clearly and how that affects people listening , ’ explained @entity111 , once a full - back for @entity113 and @entity114 and now coaching the @entity116 under - 16 team			1
‘ the movement expert was phenomenal			2
she spoke about posture and the messages it sends			2
what style of communication am i using ? how am i standing ? what am i trying to project ? ’ at the @entity38 , they studied the training regime of double @entity129 gold medallist @entity128 and learned about the ‘ marginal gains ’ which have become the mantra of @entity37			2
‘ it was the ultimate focus on small details , ’ said @entity111			0
‘ does it make the bike go faster ? we spoke to a cyclist on the podium programme for @entity139 who is taught how to eat and how to sleep			0
‘ we asked what happened if he missed a session and it was like : “ @entity146 a session ? what do you mean miss a session ? ” @entity150 people would call it obsessive , but it ’s normal to them			0
’ the @entity92 won the @entity88 held in @entity93 in may at @entity40 they marvelled at how the swimming , judo , netball and bobsleigh athletes could all spark off each other and inspire			1
‘ the swimmers spend 24 hours a week in the pool , ’ said @entity158 , who started a long playing career at @entity160 and has returned to the club to coach the under - 15 team			1
‘ what they ’ve produced results-wise at @entity40 is incredible and it ’s because of the environment they ’ve created			0
‘ it ’s a discipline			0
they do that and it becomes a habit			0
all the coaches are very open , trying to drive each other on			1
you could see it was a world - leading environment for sport			1
in football it was always about doing the bare minimum and going home			0
’ these young coaches have been hand - picked by their clubs to participate in the @entity189 coach @entity187 ( @entity190 ) , a two - year course which started last year - available to one individual from each of the 22 clubs with @entity196 status			1
as well as studying elite environments , each coach is assigned four mentors , which include high - profile experts from other sports - such as former @entity4 rugby union coach @entity202 and athletics coaching guru @entity203			1
@entity204 ( centre ) celebrates scoring for @entity206 against @entity207 in september the whole process has been deliberately kept in the shadows to give it space to evolve slowly			1
it is a key element of the @entity213 ( @entity213 ) - the brainchild of @entity215 , the @entity32 ’s director of youth			1
‘ this is not about copying another sport or another discipline but about stepping into these worlds and exploring how they do it and plotting our own path , ’ said @entity215			0
‘ this is @entity225 football taking control of its own destiny			0
’ three years after @entity213 was launched , @entity215 detects subtle signs of progress			0
there was a call he took from a @entity234 friend amazed by the quality of young @entity225 players in a tournament he had seen			1
@entity4 under 20s @entity239 celebrates scoring the winning goal to seal the @entity80 and moments like the one in the @entity243 in @entity10 , last week , when he and @entity244 , @entity160 ’s head of youth development , watched on television as teenager @entity247 come on to make his debut in the @entity249 against @entity250 at @entity251			1
@entity40 ’s phone buzzed with messages from @entity251 keeping him informed about @entity247 ’s progress : warming up , taking off tracksuit , putting on pads and coming on			0
youth development can not be rushed			2
slivers of satisfaction like these ones are what pass for reward			0
‘ we do n’t know when it will tip , ’ says @entity215			0
‘ we ’re three years into a process that might take 16			0
ultimately , the aim is to develop more and better players			2
to survive in the @entity32 they must be among the best in the world			0
’ he is starting to believe the wheel is turning and can not afford a backward step at this point			0
with some , this will rankle			0
@entity247 ( right ) made his debut for @entity160 in their @entity249 win against @entity250 last month clubs exist on the mid-slopes of football ’s pyramid , where the @entity213 has not been well received			0
some fear it will squeeze the life from those who sell to survive and encourage bigger clubs to chase players at ever younger ages because barriers have been removed and compensation figures are fixed on a sliding scale , depending on age			2
one thing is sure , if @entity225 football waits for its powerbrokers to reach agreement it will be too late			0
so they all do what they think is best			0
the @entity32 , however , has the money - from around £ 8million spent by @entity299 to upgrade their @entity196 facilities to the £ 200m spent by @entity301 to build a new training campus			2
they are committed to @entity213 as a means of developing local talent in hot - house environments built for elite sports and quelling the global scramble for the next @entity308 , thus ending the occasional clamour for more homegrown quotas			1
@entity301 have built a new £ 200million training complex which includes 16 pitches ‘ the myth that you need to reach around the world is one we ’ve been keen to counter , ’ said @entity215			0
‘ while we always want the best talent in the world , there ’s a balance to it			0
bring talent in but recognise there is talent inside your own communities that can be among the best in the world			0
‘ develop locally and recruit globally , but if you do n’t get the environment right it does n’t matter where they come from because you ’ll fail			0
physiology is n’t an issue			0
it comes down to coaching , environment , development of players — and that ’s within our means to put right			2
’ the @entity190 coaches have been to @entity42 , an interesting case study for development experts because they still operate a @entity344 - only policy and a finite talent pool , but have remained successful by blending the region ’s spirit and grit with the right coaching practices			1
it all comes back to environment , in @entity215 ’s mind			0
that ’s why he has the likes of @entity54 , @entity354 and @entity111 have been preparing for manoeuvres with the @entity43 by pretending to fight each other in the @entity12 ’s @entity357			0
@entity42 still operate a @entity344 - only policy of players throughout their club ranks			1
