applying liquid eyeliner is a notoriously tricky skill that only the most die - hard fantatics seem to have acquired			2
but a new product from @entity4 promises to make a freehand straight line quite literally fool - proof			1
the they 're real ! @entity10 boasts an italicized wand , the tip of which hugs the lash line , keeping the user on track			1
the design is patent - pending and claims to make application ' beyond easy			1
though the $ 24 ( £ 18.50 ) liner does n't hit stores until june 27 , @entity4 says it already has a 35,000 - strong wait list			1
already a liquid eyeliner fan , i usually do a series of small dashes from inner eye to outer eye to achieve an even line , mistakes concealed by a lick of smudgy kohl on top			2
but could benefit help me get that perfect 1950s flick ? i decided to test it under three of my most typical make - up application conditions : in front of a well - lit mirror at home ; using a tiny compact mirror at my desk ; and in a moving vehicle en - route to an event			1
first attempt : the eyeliner tip stayed close to the lash roots , making for a neat - ish line at home with a well - lit mirror this first test scenario allowed me to get to grips with the novel tip shape and eyeliner texture			1
instead of a liquid , like most products on the market , it is more of a paste , dispensed by a single twist of the base			0
i pointed the rubber tip at my lashline , and sure enough , it stayed in place , making for a neat - ish line in a sharp , matte black			1
i then dabbed the tip into the lash line to fill in spaces where the ink was n't quite close enough to the roots			1
at work with a hand mirror next up was using a hand mirror at my desk - i 'm often applying make - up in a rush pre-meeting			2
this time , confidence boosted , i attempted a flick			0
using the wand like a @entity87 , i drew a triangle shape at the outer edge , then dragged the tip along the lashline as usual , filling in the space between the two at the end			1
this attempt was still a little shaky - eyelids not being completely even canvases - but it was easier than the first			2
i guess practice makes perfect , even with a fool - proof liner			1
second attempt : this time a @entity104 - style flick was attempted			0
it was relatively easy , even using a tiny hand mirror , but practice makes perfect , even with a fool - proof liner do not attempt on cobblestones : applying eyeliner in the back of a taxi is a risky business in the back of a moving taxi i was dreading applying eyeliner in a moving vehicle			1
as my taxi pulled away down a cobbled street , i wondered if this would end in serious injury			0
on a smooth road , however , it seemed more feasible - despite the low light			0
a single , freehand line was not possible with the jerky stop - start movements of the car , so i resorted to my tried and true technique of dashes , and ended up with a just - about - acceptable result			2
the pros : the eyeliner does hug the lashline , making a straight line easier to achieve			2
it has a lovely inky , matte finish ( some eyeliners can be a bit chalky ) , and it truly does n't budge once it 's on			0
the cons : it does n't budge			0
i looked like a raccoon when i tried to take it off			0
an oil - based make - up remover seemed to do the trick			0
a couple of colleagues who also tried the liner were n't comfortable with the italicized tip or paste - like texture , preferring their traditional liquid liners instead			1
the expert 's verdict : celebrity make - up artist @entity156 , whose clients include @entity158 and @entity159 , was immediately impressed by the they 're real ! @entity161			1
' this is great , because it 's like a @entity87 for your eye , ' she said			0
' this felt tip pen has a nice angled sharp edge			0
and it stays really nice and black			0
' once it 's dry , it really does n't move , ' she added			0
' it 's a really fantastic product			0
' benefit they 're real ! @entity10 goes on sale on june 27th in the @entity176 and june 28th in the @entity177			1
the benefit boutique in @entity179 , @entity180 , will be stocking it early , from thursday 26th june .			2

the they 're real ! @entity10 boasts a patent - pending italicized wand , the tip of which claims to hug the lash line , keeping the user on track
benefit already has a 35,000 - strong wait list and the $ 24 ( £ 18.50 ) liner does n't even hit stores until the end of june
