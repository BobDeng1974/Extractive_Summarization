@entity9 's clinical veterinary officer @entity29 said : ' the large litter is in itself unusual , but for so many to survive the birth is exceptional			0
' late pregnancy is very draining even for cats in good health , so for an underweight stray like @entity4 it would have been particularly gruelling			2
' first time mums usually have smaller litters , so it 's possible @entity4 may already have had a litter , despite being so young herself			0
' it 's hard not to find @entity4 's story heart - warming , especially at this time of year			0
one of the kittens was stillborn but ten of the kittens are all in good health after the five - hour long labour @entity4 , believed to be aged one , was handed into the charity one week earlier , after a householder who had been feeding her noticed she was heavily pregnant ' but it 's important to remember this is not a fairytale - @entity4 was a stray who has been through quite an ordeal to carry and give birth to so many kittens			1
' she is lucky that someone noticed her and handed her into us as it is likely that many more of her kittens would have perished otherwise			0
' cats usually give birth to an average of three to six kittens			1
larger litters often result in high rates of stillbirth			0
