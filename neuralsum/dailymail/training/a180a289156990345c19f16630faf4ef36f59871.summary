tv sitcoms like ' @entity1 ' in which characters make jokes at someone else 's expense are no laughing matter for older adults , according to new research			1
a new study has found that while young and middle - aged people think that ‘ aggressive humour ’ is funny , senior citizens are n’t amused			1
instead , the older generation prefer ‘ affiliative humour , ’ in which a number of characters share and deal with an awkward situation			2
the @entity29 - based team , led by @entity30 , studied the reaction of participants as they watched 14 video clips			1
they noted how often each volunteer smiled and laughed			0
they also had electrodes attached to their faces to detect muscle movements made by smiling			0
scientists are trying to harness the unintentional humour of autocorrect mistakes by teaching computers to be funny			2
the researchers in @entity45 and @entity46 took thousands of real text messages and tried to change them slightly like an autocorrect would - before asking people online to rate the humour			1
@entity52 professor @entity51 and his colleagues found taboo words increase the chance of texts becoming funny - as well as those where they are normal until the very end			1
professor @entity51 said he decided to carry out the study following an autocorrect error that had seen him sign off an email with the phrase ‘ best retards ’ , rather than ‘ best regards ’			0
he told @entity67 : ‘ it is about understanding what mechanisms lie behind humour			0
texts are a particularly good mechanism for that			0
there is a research field called ' computational creativity '			0
‘ it is about how to make computers more creative			0
telling jokes is one sort of creativity			0
some of the applications for this line of work could be in computer dialogue systems , to make them more humanlike			0
’ the paper also found ‘ meet at the bum stop ’ is a funny autocorrected text , although ‘ just off from berk ... sorry i mean work ’ is not so humorous			1
the study involved 30 participants 17 - 21 years old , 22 who were 35 - 56 years old and 29 who were 64 - 84 years old			1
the 64 - to - 84 - year - olds found clips from @entity1 around 23 per cent less funny than the middle - aged people did , and about 19 per cent less funny than the 17 - to - 21 - year - olds did			1
young adults were also more likely to laugh at the self - deprecating humor , found in clips of episodes such as @entity27			1
professor @entity107 said she finds both types of humour funny , but that the study has made her rethink the jokes she makes in her lectures			2
‘ the study raises some intriguing questions about our concept of what is funny , ’ she said			2
‘ is that concept based on factors peculiar to generations , or does it evolve over time as we age and , perhaps , mellow ? ‘ those possibilities will need to be explored in a future episode of humour research			0

the study studied reactions of young , middle - aged and older adults
they were shown clips from shows such as @entity25 and mr @entity26
64 - to - 84 - year - olds found @entity1 23 **%** less funny than the middle - aged people did , and about 19 **%** less funny than the 17 - to - 21 - year - olds
young adults were also more likely to laugh at the self - deprecating humor , found in clips of episodes such as @entity27
