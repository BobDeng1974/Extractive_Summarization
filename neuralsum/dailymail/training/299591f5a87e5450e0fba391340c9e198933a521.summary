a senior @entity1 officer who works closely with high - ranking staff in the @entity3 told @entity4 on wednesday that outgoing defense secretary @entity5 is ' relieved ' to be leaving the @entity6			1
at a coffee shop a half - mile from the @entity6 , the officer said @entity9 complained regularly about having to publicly defend president @entity11 's military policies and priorities , a job requirement he 's eager to leave behind			1
he described @entity9 as ' a good guy who ultimately looked in the mirror one day and realized he could n’t hold his nose anymore			0
' ' he jumped at the chance to get out , and could n't wait to announce it so things did n't go more to hell in @entity21 and he ’d get blamed for it			1
it 's highly unusual for an active - duty officer to speak so plainly			0
media reports last week largely repeated whispers from inside the @entity41 , concluding that @entity11 asked for @entity9 's resignation because he slow - walked the emptying of the @entity45 military prison , which is used to house suspected international terrorists			1
but @entity47 reported tuesday that @entity9 himself accelerated his departure			0
' he wanted to move quickly , ' a @entity9 confidante told the network			0
after months of frustration with the @entity41 , that source said , @entity9 wanted to ' at least control his departure			2
' his farewell ceremony , which @entity9 himself forced the @entity41 to hold before @entity11 settled on a successor , was a study in contrasts			2
while @entity11 praised him as a former enlisted soldier who spilled ' blood and treasure ' and made ' sacrifices ' on the battlefield – and turned to look directly at him frequently – @entity9 himself stared ahead and made no eye contact			2
@entity4 's @entity6 insider explained @entity9 's detached nature as the product of presiding over a @entity6 in disarray and distrustful of its commander - in - chief			1
‘ no one wants to be disloyal , ' he said			0
' but also nobody wants to be on watch while the @entity6 weakens to the point of disintegrating , and @entity78 gets pushed around the [ global ] schoolyard			2
’ asked for an assessment of former deputy secretary @entity34 , now the odds - on lock to succeed @entity9 , he said the rank and file like him personally			1
' he 's a personable guy – not warm , exactly , but clear - headed and genuine			0
' but the rank - and - file expect @entity34 to be @entity11 's next ' yes - man , ' he said – which worries them			2
@entity87 ? @entity9 ' could n't wait to announce it , ' a source said , ' so things did n't go more to hell in @entity21 and he ’d get blamed for it ' ‘ the @entity95 war is n’t going well , we ’re being weakened with budget cuts and troop draw - downs , and we can hardly float a navy anymore , ' he explained			1
' it ’s clear the president is doing this intentionally , and he ’s looking for someone new to rubber stamp him			0
’ @entity104 @entity103 sen. @entity103 , who ran unsuccessfully against @entity11 for the presidency in 2008 , told a radio interviewer on the day @entity9 announced his departure that he had recently spoken with the defense secretary – and the topic turned to their mutual displeasure with the @entity41			1
' i know @entity5 was frustrated with aspects of the administration 's national security policy and decision making process , ' @entity103 told @entity118 550 - am			0
' his predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the @entity41 and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs @entity123 's situation was no different			0

senior officer close to the @entity3 told @entity4 that the outgoing secretary was ' relieved ' to part ways with the @entity41
' he jumped at the chance to get out , and could n't wait to announce it , ' the well - placed source said
@entity9 was worried things would ' go more to hell in @entity21 ' and ' he *'d* get blamed for it '
@entity41 is close to officially nominating former deputy secretary @entity34 to *replace* @entity9
@entity6 source believes @entity11 is ' looking for someone to rubber stamp him ' as he *shrinks* the @entity78 military and *lessens* @entity78 's influence *abroad*
