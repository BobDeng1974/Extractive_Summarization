@entity1 sen. @entity0 , a leading opponent of president @entity3 's restoration of ties to @entity5 , called on the administration on tuesday to cancel talks with @entity8 until dozens of detainees are released			1
the promised release of 53 people @entity12 considers political prisoners was part of @entity3 's dec. 17 announcement that he planned to normalize relations with @entity5 after decades of hostile relations with the island			1
' the expectation right now is that they 've already made this commitment and we expect them to live up to it , ' @entity3 's spokesman , @entity19 , told reporters today , noting that the @entity28 regime promised to release the group not just to the @entity30 but also the @entity31			1
but @entity33 spokeswoman @entity32 said during her daily briefing that releasing the prisoners is not a pre-condition for holding talks or the eventual normalization of relations			1
@entity1 sen. @entity0 wants the @entity3 administration to cancel talks with @entity8 until dozens of detainees are released @entity33 plans to begin hammering out details of opening a new embassy in @entity5 even if all the prisoners are not released , @entity32 said			1
the @entity46 has steadfastly refused to give out the names of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees			1
' we ’re not in a position to talk about specific numbers , ' @entity19 said today			0
' we ’ve been careful about talking about the number of prisoners and who they are because we do n’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents , ' he explained			2
@entity32 confirmed on tuesday that some had been set free a day after saying she could not publicly confirm that even one had been let go			0
she did not provide a number			0
' they have already released some of the prisoners			0
we would like to see this completed in the near future , ' she told reporters			0
the @entity33 official indicated on monday that the @entity3 administration likely would n't release the names of the dissidents who were held even after they are no longer in captivity			1
' we ’re not going to outline who those individuals were , ' she said			0
' i do n’t expect we ’ll be releasing a public list			0
' a source with knowledge of the agreed prisoner release told @entity81 the delay stems from lack of a final deal on where the prisoners will go - leaving for the @entity30 or @entity86 , or staying in @entity5			2
in the past the @entity5 government has preferred that such prisoners leave the country when released			2
but someare likely to insist on their right to stay in @entity5 and continue fighting for their political rights			2
the fate of the detainees has provided ammunition for congressional critics of @entity3 's policy shift			1
@entity0 , who is the son of @entity5 immigrants , and others have said they will seek to slow or block moves toward improved ties with @entity8			0
lawmakers are expected to hold hearings on @entity3 's @entity5 policy in the first weeks of the new @entity106 , which was sworn in on tuesday			1
@entity0 said @entity107 , the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs , should cancel a trip to @entity8 later this month to discuss normalizing relations at least until the 53 are released			0
' to date , no information has been provided about the political prisoners to be released – regarding their identities , conditions or whereabouts , even on a confidential basis , to members of @entity106 , ' @entity0 , a @entity1 @entity111 and possible presidential candidate , said in a letter to @entity3 today			1
' just yesterday , your own @entity33 was unable to provide an explanation about the political prisoners in question			1
' the freshman lawmaker reiterated his position that the @entity3 administration 's new @entity5 policy is ' flawed ' and contended that ' the least your @entity129 can do now is hold the regime accountable ' for freeing not only the 53 dissidents but political prisoners who have since been detained			1
' a failure to do so will further embolden the regime to continue its oppression , ' he said			0
' almost three weeks after your @entity5 announcement , there is absolutely no reason why any of these individuals should be in prison or the targets of repression - or for their identities , conditions and whereabouts to remain such closely held secrets			0
' the @entity46 has steadfastly refused to give out the names of the 53 or even confirm the number of detainees			1
' we do n’t want to put an even bigger target on their back as political dissidents , ' @entity3 's spokesman , @entity19 , said today several mostly @entity111 members of @entity106 , led by @entity0 and other @entity5 - @entity30 lawmakers , have expressed deep concerns about @entity3 's decision to ditch a half - century of @entity30 isolation of @entity5			1
they argue that @entity3 's policy shift provides legitimacy - and money - to the island nation 's communist government even as it continues to violate the human rights of its people			2
whether the discord amounts in the long run to anything more than speed bumps on the way to wider detente remains to be seen			0
but at a minimum , they illustrate how benefits from @entity3 's ditching of a half - century of @entity30 isolation of @entity5 wo n't come quickly or without rancorous debate			1
on tuesday , @entity3 discussed @entity5 with @entity181 president @entity180 during a @entity46 meeting			2
@entity180 pledged that his country would be a ' tireless supporter ' of the ' audacious ' move to normalize relations			2
signaling that it will continue to suppress dissent , the government of @entity5 president @entity28 on tuesday detained more than 50 activists , dissident leaders said , to squelch a planned gathering in @entity8 's @entity192			0
and dissidents reported new detentions on thursday			0
the crackdown brought sharp condemnation from the @entity33			0
all of those detained had been released by the weekend , dissidents said .			0
