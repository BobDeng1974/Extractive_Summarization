by @entity0 from getting rid of wrinkles within 30 days to firming up your jawline in just two weeks , beauty companies are famous for their bold claims			1
but while such bold claims may have made it into the 21st century , thankfully , some of the more outlandish methods to prove them did not			1
among the more bizarre - and terrifying - is the ' atomic test ' devised by one beauty company , which involved slathering a model 's face with radioactive dust and using a @entity16 counter to see how much of it cleansing removed			1
using a @entity16 counter , a device used by scientists to measure the amount of radiation in a given location , the company was able to prove that their cold cream removed more atomic dust than the three nameless products also used			1
those tempted to buy the cold cream could then write to @entity40 for a free ' atomic test booklet ' , outlining the details of the experiment			0
although the advertisement claimed that most of the dust had been removed from the hapless model 's face , the truth remains that even small amounts are enough to lead to serious health problems			1
most experts agree even low doses of radiation can dramatically increase the risk of cancer and the risk of cancer increases as the dose of radiation increases			0
exposure to radiation over time is estimated to increase the lifetime risk of fatal cancer by around five per cent on average			0
testing : @entity40 pitted its cold cream against competitors and found it was best at removing atomic dust the shocking clip is n't the only bizarre retro beauty ad to make a resurgence			1
another unusual film is a tutorial which explains how to straighten the hair in an age before @entity78 hair straighteners existed			1
the @entity80 clip , filmed in the @entity81 in @entity82 , shows an @entity84 woman having her naturally curly hair straightened - accompanied by commentary that sounds jarringly old fashioned to modern ears			1
' now for an eye opener on women 's top question : hair , ' the commentary begins			1
' most hairdressers spend their time putting curls into women 's hair and keeping them there long enough to justify all the talk about permanent waves			2
' here at the @entity102 , we met a hair expert who does permanent waving in reverse			2
her clients are @entity84 and they are all born with a permanent wave but do they like it ? they 're women , are n't they ? ' round they come to the club in @entity111 to be un-permed			1
the idea is to take out all the kinks in the hair and give it a permanent straight look			2
' the advice includes soaking the hair with a selection of ' secret oils ' before splitting it into six and straightening it with combs heated on a stove			2
unknown : the advice calls for a ' secret blend ' of hair straightening oils to be slathered over the scalp sleek : @entity131 heated on a brazier were used to get rid of natural curls in a process that took two hours complete : the finished look was typical of the post-war period with smooth waves and elaborate fringe @entity141 , a @entity82 - based @entity142 hair specialist , comments : ' what an amazing film , i love the 40s and 50s as an era			1
' the negatives about the film are firstly how we take care of clients			2
service levels have changed immeasurably too			0
' in the film the stylist pulls the client ’s head forward – this would never ever happen today			2
' whether washing , styling or putting any products in the hair , you always pull back to avoid anything going in the client 's eyes			0
' i think in this day and age @entity167 would have a lot to say about putting ‘ secret oils ’ in a client ’s hair			0
' with all hair products , you must give the client all the information and be completely transparent regarding the product ’s content			0
despite the downsides , says @entity141 , the neatly waved result is surprisingly up to date and on trend for 2013			0
' this look however works really well for young , on - trend women in the same way that @entity184 rocked a beehive early in her career			0
' for those who do n’t fall into that category , it 's better to go for a look that suits you rather than listening to fashion			0
' it ’s interesting and influential but it should help you shape your own sense of style			0

@entity25 used radioactive dust to prove its claims
a @entity16 counter was used to show how much dust had been removed
another retro film shows how @entity142 hair was smoothed in days before @entity209
