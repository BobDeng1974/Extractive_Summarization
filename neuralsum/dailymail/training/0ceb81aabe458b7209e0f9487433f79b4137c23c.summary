by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ former @entity3 manager @entity2 believes that @entity4 can emerge from the wreckage of a dismal first season at @entity7 and evolve into an important player for the club			1
@entity2 , who was sacked in april after enduring a traumatic first campaign in charge of @entity3 , signed @entity4 from the duo ’s former side @entity12 on deadline day of last summer ’s transfer window for £ 27.5million but the @entity17 midfielder suffered a torrid debut season , making only 19 starts and failing to score a single goal			1
it is understood that @entity3 would be receptive to offers approaching £ 18million for @entity4 , with the former @entity12 midfielder emerging as a scapegoat for much of the debris of @entity2 ’ dismal season in charge			1
writing in his column for the @entity44 , @entity2 admitted that @entity4 found the ordeal a difficult experience : ‘ i felt for him over the criticism he took			1
he ’s a shy boy , a humble boy , a quiet personality			0
despite appearances - the hair makes him look like an extrovert - he ’s a gentle , sometimes , emotional soul who is so desperate to do well and he was hurting because he was n’t able to show his true self at the start of his @entity3 career			2
’ ‘ without going over old ground regarding last summer ’s transfer window , i want to make two points			0
the last thing we wanted was to makie him my first signing as @entity3 manager and the only signing of the summer			2
‘ that was always going to bring too great a spotlight on him			0
but by the time we got to deadline day the club had n’t been able to close a couple of big deals and there was no choice			0
’ past life : the duo together during their more successful period at @entity12 mucking about : @entity4 playing with a sprinkler dring @entity31 training ahead of their game with @entity82 @entity4 demonstrated his qualities with a match - turning performance from the substitute ’s bench in @entity31 ’s 2 - 1 @entity88 win over @entity33 , scoring with a crucial goal to lead his side to victory			1
‘ his size is such a threat to the opposition , ’ @entity2 continued , ’ he ’s technically gifted , especially when it comes to chest control , and he ’s formidable in the air - though , actually , i feel he should score more headers than he does			2
‘ he has brilliant fitness , a brilliant attitude			0
what we saw him do against @entity33 was what i brought him to @entity3 for			1
' he took time to settle at @entity7 but in the final month of last season was becoming an influence , a different sort of player to the ones already there and one who was having an impact in games and helping produce goals			0
i feel he still has the potential to go on and be a good @entity3 player			0

@entity4 can *recover* from poor first season at @entity3 , according to @entity2
was brought to the club by the @entity1*21* last summer , but both *disappointed*
