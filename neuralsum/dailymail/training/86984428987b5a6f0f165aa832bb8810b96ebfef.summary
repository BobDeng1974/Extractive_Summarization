by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 20 february 2013 @entity1 said his wife @entity2 had to stop him from jumping out of the window after his drink was apparently spiked with @entity6 @entity1 was taken to hospital suffering ‘ a full on psychotic episode ’ after his drink was apparently spiked with the drug lsd			1
speaking last night , the tv star revealed his terrified wife and friends locked him in a room for his safety after he tried to jump out of a window until an ambulance came to take him			1
@entity1 , wife @entity2 and their children were staying at a family friend ’s house in @entity21 last friday when he ‘ flipped ’ after returning from a country pub. he said : ‘ i do n’t like using the word , but i was acting like a stereotypical madman			1
i thought i was doomed , i thought i was going to die			0
‘ my wife and friends kept trying to calm me down as i was threatening to hurt myself			1
i was 100 per cent out of my normal character			0
’ he said he ‘ all was fine ’ when they returned to the house about midnight and estimated he had drunk no more than half a bottle of wine			0
but after going to settle son @entity34 , three , back down , he realised something ‘ very strange ’ was happening to him as he attended to @entity36 , one			0
he said : ‘ i started feeling hypersensitive and i knew something was wrong			0
i picked my daughter up and she felt incredibly light , like a grain of rice			0
‘ i suddenly had this compulsion to jump through a window			1
i went back into the bedroom and asked my wife , “ are you feeling ok ”			2
she said “ yeah , are you ? ” and i said , “ @entity47 ”			0
‘ i was staring at her and then i just flipped and had a full on psychotic episode			2
i was ranting , marching up and down , hitting walls , trying to jump out of windows			2
my wife ran out and had to get my friends who had to restrain me			1
’ they managed to ‘ corral ’ him into the living room until a paramedic arrived			0
‘ it was like having an out of body experience , ’ said @entity1 , 39 , who explained that he has never voluntarily taken recreational drugs			1
‘ it was really upsetting because my wife had to see all of this			2
‘ they had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself			0
i wanted to throw myself on a glass table and through a window			1
’ the couple were staying with friends when he ' flipped ' after returning from a country @entity69 ruled out the episode was due to neurological or psychological reasons at one point he found himself doing a recreation of a sketch from the @entity76 tv show			1
‘ i started doing very strange walks , like the @entity78			0
‘ it went from scary to comical			0
i was trying to get into bags			0
’ @entity1 asked to be restrained after a paramedic came			1
‘ i wanted them to give me a sedative to make it stop			2
the paramedic did some tests and knew that i had to go to hospital so an ambulance was called			2
‘ by now the whole experience took a different shift and it went from this aggressive episode into what i ’d call a spacey moment			0
‘ in the ambulance they were saying to my wife he must be on some sort of drugs			2
’ he said the episode lasted about six hours and he ended up ‘ very emotional and very teary ’ on saturday morning			2
@entity1 spent about 12 hours in @entity100			1
he said the hospital does not do toxicology tests so he could not find out for certain if his drink was spiked			1
as a result he spent three days having tests on his heart and brain and being seen by psychiatrists			1
@entity1 , pictured with son @entity34 , now three , is most angered by the fact that he handled his children while under a ' very psychotic drug ' ‘ i ’ve spent the last few days genuinely worrying that i was going crazy , ’ he said			1
‘ when you go through this and do n’t know why you start questioning your sanity			0
‘ but five doctors have now concluded it was almost certainly drugs and have 100 per cent ruled out that it was neurological or psychological			2
’ he added : ‘ i ’ve always been 100 per cent certain that i was spiked , however unlikely the scenario			0
‘ why would someone do it ? i have no idea			0
it seems a bit of a coincidence that i was out with my wife and friends and i was the only person targeted			1
’ he said from what he has been told he is convinced it was the hallucinogenic drug lsd			0
what most angers @entity1 most about the person who did it is that he handled his children while under a ‘ very psychotic drug ’			1
@entity1 has reported the incident to police			1
he added : ‘ what i ’ve realised from my experience is that drink spiking is a big thing			0
’ @entity1 , who sprang to fame after appearing in @entity141 in 2000 , had to postpone a five - week trip to @entity143 for a @entity145 show while the tests were completed			1
he appealed to the person who spiked his drink to come forward and explain what they had done			1
‘ i might stare at you for a while but i would forgive you , ’ he said			0
‘ i just want to know what you put into my drink and into my body			0
