@entity13 – who for five years ran the campaign group supporting abortion rights and sex education – said that she was delighted at her appointment to ‘ the ultimate feminist organisation ’			2
however , her role at @entity20 has raised eyebrows among some religious groups and those who are concerned about the premature sexualisation of girls			2
under miss @entity2 ’s leadership the fpa – formerly known as the @entity27 – sells condom demonstrators for use by girls as young as 11 and opened an online sex shop sells sex toys and aids to customers of any age , subject only to some users ticking a box to confirm they are over 18			1

miss @entity2 also insisted that there was no contradiction between her previous work at the fpa and her appointment to the £ 85,000 - a - year job			1
‘ i have worked in a wide range of settings and i have a broad insight into what affects girls , ’ she said			2
‘ i do n’t think any of this is at odds with the @entity12			2
in fact i believe the @entity12 is the ultimate feminist organisation			2
’ the move comes at a time when the movement has been in competition with the @entity61 to attract members			2
although the female - only guides have 538,000 members from the age of 11 , the @entity61 , who have been recruiting girls since the 1970s , have more than 66,000 in their ranks			1
confidence : @entity2 hopes to encourage young girls to become confident , self - assured women miss @entity2 ’s appointment was criticised by @entity74 groups and family campaigners last night			1
they claimed that the campaigner was an unsuitable figure to run the movement which should provide girls with an alternative to celebrity culture and early sex			0
back in the day : a brownie in 1970s @entity85 @entity86 , of the @entity88 think - tank , said : ‘ i do not think she is a fitting individual to run the @entity12			0
‘ @entity90 is an organisation which should protect girls from these sorts of pressures			0
’ @entity94 , an author and researcher specialising in social policy , said : ‘ one of the reasons why girls want to join the @entity12 , and their parents are happy that they should do so , is that they can learn leadership qualities and escape from the sex and television culture			0
‘ i would have hoped that anyone leading the guides would understand that			1
i do n’t believe that miss @entity2 does			1
’ the fpa was one of the leading state - subsidised organisations which , under @entity111 ’s government , attempted to reduce teenage pregnancy rates			0
although levels did fall , the campaign fell far short of its target of halving pregnancies among girls under 18			0
it is currently selling a condom demonstrator as part of a catalogue of ‘ young people resources aged 11 and above ’ alongside sex education leaflets for girls of 12 and over			0
one booklet , called @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , tells young readers they are ready for sex if they can answer ‘ yes ’ to four questions			0
it says : ‘ ask yourself these questions : do you want to have sex ( for you , not for someone else ) ? do you like , trust , respect your partner ? ‘ are you prepared to take responsibility for having safer sex ? are you prepared for the possible emotional rollercoaster of rejection or break - up ? ’ the way we were : @entity147 in @entity148 in 1950 this year the organisation has opened an online shop , @entity151 , which sells a wide range of sex toys and aids alongside condoms			0
items on sale include ‘ bondage gear ’			1
miss @entity2 said in an interview with @entity160 : ‘ everyone has heard of the @entity12 but not everyone understands that today it is very different			1
‘ they are rooted to the image of what the @entity12 were years ago			0
i want to help the public understand what they guides are now			1
‘ it is not about itchy brown uniforms and sewing and baking			0
it is a modern , contemporary , vibrant organisation			0
‘ guides in 2012 are more likely to be investigating a muddy ravine , going overseas to help on an @entity178 programme , or going to one of our pop concerts			1
