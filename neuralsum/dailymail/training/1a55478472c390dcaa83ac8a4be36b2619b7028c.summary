by @entity1 reporter published : 14:19 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 16:28 est , 5 september 2013 a judge has ruled today that controversial bite mark evidence can be used in a @entity6 murder trial , disappointing critics of the technique , who have called it a ' victory for the flat @entity13 society '			1
evidence from bite marks on victims ' bodies has helped trap notorious rapists and killers , including @entity20 , but at least 24 men have had convictions overturned since 2000 because of flaws in the forensic method			1
in the trial of murder suspect @entity28 , @entity26 @entity25 said today that bite analysis does meet the standards of evidence in @entity6 law			1
evidence : forensic dentist @entity34 presenting bite analysis at the trial of @entity20 in 1979 the forensic technique involves comparing bite marks left on the flesh of victims with the teeth of suspects			1
but , in the past 13 years , several convicts have been exonerated , some after spending more than a decade in prison or on death row , according to an @entity48 study and findings by the @entity50 , which helps wrongfully convicted inmates win freedom through dna testing			2
the @entity48 analysis is the most comprehensive count to date of those exonerated after being convicted or charged based partially or entirely on bite mark evidence			1
in allowing bite mark analysis in his courtroom , justice @entity25 declined to spell out his reasoning , but said it met @entity6 law guidelines and was ' obviously a field that has not been looked at closely by the courts in a long time '			2
@entity65 , director at the @entity50 , was at thursday 's hearing and said the judge 's decision was ' contrary to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community '			0
' it 's a victory for the flat @entity13 society , ' he said			0
the @entity50 and other defense attorneys slam bite mark analysis as sham science and argue that it should no longer be allowed in courtrooms			2
trial : bite analysis will be used in the case of @entity80 , charged with murdering @entity81 many forensic dentists defend the practice as useful , especially when trying to eliminate suspects , and say it has helped convict murderers and rapists , most famously serial killer @entity20			1
in the @entity6 trial of @entity28 , the 41 - year - old is accused of killing 33 - year - old @entity81 , whose beaten and strangled body was found wrapped in garbage bags under a bed in a hotel near @entity94 in 2007			0
a forensic dentist concluded that a mark on her body matched the teeth of @entity28 , a fugitive sex offender from @entity99			2
@entity28 told police he killed miss @entity81 in self - defense , saying she and another man attacked him in an attempted robbery after he agreed to pay her for sex			0
no other man was found			0
his attorneys declined to comment after thursday 's hearing			0
prosecutors wanted the bite mark evidence allowed at his trial to help convince jurors of @entity28 's guilt			1
his defense attorneys wanted it barred because of past mistakes involving the practice and how powerful bite mark evidence can be to jurors , even with opposing testimony			1
dr @entity120 , a @entity121 forensic dentist , testified in last year 's hearings that bite mark analysis is valid when used in a closed population of suspects and that problems of the past can be blamed on individual dentists , not the science itself			1
' the issue is not that bite mark analysis is invalid , but that bite mark examiners are not properly vetted , ' he said			2
dr @entity120 added that he could n't imagine a case today in which he would identify a biter unless ' there was other very strong corroborating evidence '			0
testifying for defense attorneys at the hearings was dr @entity142 , a @entity143 researcher who has used computer models to study bite marks made on bodies using a vice grip and dental models			0
analysis : forensic dentistry studies links between a suspect 's imprint and marks left on victims convicted : serial killer and rapist @entity20 , center , was found guilty based , in part , on evidence taken from a bite mark her research , published in the @entity163 , found human dentition is not unique and can not be accurately transferred to skin			1
dr @entity166 acknowledged that a significant limitation of her research included its use of dead bodies that have been frozen and thawed , and using machinery to create bite marks - a method far from recreating a real - life bite made on a live person during an act of violence			0
she testified that she did not feel bite marks should be admissible in courtrooms , but that more research in the field is needed .			0

forensic technique was used to help prosecute serial killer @entity20
critics have called for its *ban* after 24 *people* were wrongly convicted based on bite evidence
