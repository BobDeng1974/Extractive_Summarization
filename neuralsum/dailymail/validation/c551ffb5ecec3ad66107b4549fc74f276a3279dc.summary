@entity0 , the winner of sunday ’s @entity2 @entity1 , has told @entity4 ’s cynics that the rules of the sport should not be ripped up to slow him down			1
the world champion was replying to @entity9 team principal @entity8 , who called on the @entity10 to limit the superiority of @entity14 ’s @entity13 team to make the season a more even fight			1
@entity8 ’s view was supported on monday by @entity17 , the sport ’s commercial boss , who said : ‘ @entity9 are 100 per cent right			1
@entity0 celebrates his @entity2 @entity1 win after he finished ahead of team - mate @entity21 the @entity23 star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at @entity25 on monday ‘ there is a rule i think ( former @entity10 president ) @entity30 put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic , which @entity13 have done , the @entity10 can level up things			1
@entity13 have done a first - class job			1
we need to change things a little bit now			0
‘ what we should have done was frozen the @entity13 engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up			1
we should support the @entity10 to make changes			1
’ the indications were that the @entity10 , the sport ’s rule - makers , will not rush to act on @entity17 ’s words , which may have been intended primarily to soothe @entity9 , whose motorsport adviser @entity53 said they might walk away in light of rules that ‘ will kill the sport ’			1
@entity0 , celebrating his 34th career victory in @entity59 , detected an irony in @entity9 ’s criticism			1
also on the podium was @entity64 ’s @entity63 who , as a @entity9 driver , won four consecutive championships from 2010			1
on sunday it was third - placed @entity63 ’s turn to finish more than half a minute behind @entity0 and his @entity13 team - mate @entity21			1
@entity0 and @entity21 finished more than half - a - minute ahead of third - placed @entity63 on sunday @entity0 sprays champagne after winning the opening race of the year ; his seventh win from the last eight @entity73 cruises to victory in @entity2 gp @entity0 said : ‘ i was sitting next to @entity63 after the race and i said : “ @entity63 , you did this for four years			1
you were 30 seconds ahead			0
so i know how it must have felt back then			0
” ‘ he had nobody behind pushing him			0
at least i ’ve got my team - mate , who i was really racing			0
i do n’t remember that ever being the case with @entity9			1
’ ouch , even though @entity84 did sometimes push @entity63 , and not all of the @entity86 ’s championships were comfortable , with his first title coming down to a four - way decider in @entity89			0
@entity0 added : ‘ if you want to put someone in the same car , there is no doubt where i would be finishing			2
people say it ’s all the car			0
well , it ’s a big team that built this car			0
i ’m the one who has to get in and extract the best from it			0
there has never been a driver that has won the championship that has n’t had a great car that year			0
there ’s nobody who had a @entity107 and won the world championship , is there ? @entity110 still had a great car			0
’ former @entity9 racer @entity84 interviews his old boss @entity8 ahead of sunday 's race @entity8 's @entity9 have threatened to withdraw from the sport if changes are not implemented @entity0 ’s views will be shared by those who believe @entity13 should be allowed to reap the rewards for their hard work , but @entity9 ’s @entity53 said : ‘ we will evaluate the situation again in the summer			1
if we are totally dissatisfied , we could contemplate an @entity4 exit			2
‘ yes , the danger is there that mr @entity125 ( the owner ) loses his passion for @entity4			2
’ meanwhile , @entity17 has said @entity127 must pay for not putting out a car in @entity59			2
the team , who blamed software problems for not turning a wheel , believed they had met the terms of their contract and would collect £ 28million in prize money by turning up in @entity2			0
but @entity17 said : ‘ they had no intention of racing			2
