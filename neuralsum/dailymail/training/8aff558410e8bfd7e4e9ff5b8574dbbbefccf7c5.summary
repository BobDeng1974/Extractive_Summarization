by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 3 june 2013 the @entity1 has defended a law exam described as ' horrific ' by students because of its graphic depictions of oral sex , male rape and naked torture			1
the university 's renowned law faculty has used real - life scenarios for exams in the past , but many students were left shocked by its latest test questions			1
around 200 students sitting the exam on saturday morning were presented with a scenario involving a fictional college drinking society 's initiation ceremony which went on to describe several indecent assaults			1
test : around 200 students at the @entity1 , pictured , sat a law exam on saturday which contained graphic depictions of oral sex , male rape and torture the question in the three - hour exam at the university 's @entity29 began : ' @entity31 is president of @entity32 , a @entity34 drinking society			1
she is organising the initiation of new members			0
' after a great deal of alcohol has been drunk , the members of the society form a circle around @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 who are to be initiated			0
' the question then described three rituals in which a male student was blindfolded and given oral sex by another man , another was sexually assaulted with a bottle and a third had his pubic hair shaved off before dying from a subsequent infection			0
the students were asked to outline any offences which may have been committed during the scenario			2
after the exam students took to social networking sites with one describing it as ' horrific ' and ' beyond acceptable '			1
@ mirandajulietp tweeted : ' that 's a horrific question - so far beyond acceptable and a total misrepresentation of most socs , actually '			2
online student newspaper @entity65 said the reaction from the student body had ' varied from incredulity to mild amusement '			0
standard practice : the @entity29 at @entity72 , pictured , has used ' hypothetical situations ' in previous law exams shock : many students took to @entity77 to express their views on the ' far beyond acceptable ' questions posed in a recent law exam @entity81 , a third year law student at @entity34 , told the website : ' it was surprising to see the university directly reference drinking societies and particularly initiations , which they generally tend to turn a blind eye to			1
' but @entity65 added that other students felt that the question demonstrated that the university is keeping up with the times , with one fresher from @entity93 quoted as saying : ' drinking socs are , after all , a big part of life at @entity72			2
' @entity97 , who sat the exam , told the @entity99 that no - one in the examination hall had reacted when they first read the paper			2
he said : ' nobody batted an eyelid , nobody sniggered or looked up or glanced at anyone – you just got on with it			0
' i can see why it might look a bit funny			0
i can understand why people might think that 's a bit risqué			0
' the @entity29 has previously used graphic scenarios in its papers with one exam , which was posted online last year , presenting a similar question about a drinking society initiation ceremony which involved running naked through @entity72 while being beaten with stinging nettles			0
a @entity1 spokesman confirmed the incident , saying : ' in the @entity126 examination paper set by the @entity127 , hypothetical situations are presented in order to test students ' understanding of different aspects of @entity126			1

around 200 students sat the three - hour - long exam on saturday morning
many later took to @entity77 , describing it as ' horrific ' and ' beyond acceptable '
@entity1 spokesman said the ' hypothetical situations ' were to test students ' understanding of different aspects of @entity126
