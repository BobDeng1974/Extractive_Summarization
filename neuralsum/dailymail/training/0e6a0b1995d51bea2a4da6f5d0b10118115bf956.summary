@entity1 director dr. @entity0 began his grilling thursday on @entity3 with a stark admission that his agency is still searching for ways to combat the ebola virus as it burrows into the @entity8			1
' we 're always open to ideas for what we can do to keep @entity8 safe , ' @entity0 said in his opening statement , in a startling departure from his prepared remarks in the face of a hostile and impatient panel in a @entity18 subcommittee			2
' we would consider any options to better protect @entity8 , ' he said later during the hearing 's q&a period			2
@entity0 's statements will not inspire already - shattered public confidence			1
the first @entity25 patient identified on @entity8 soil , @entity27 , was misdiagnosed			1
two nurses caring for him have since contracted the body - destroying hemorrhagic fever – one of whom got on a flight with the @entity1 's blessing a day before she was hospitalized			1
@entity58 press secretary @entity64 told reporters that the @entity1 director was responsible – implying that president @entity67 is not			1
' you have seen , at least in a couple instances , dr. @entity0 taking responsibility ' for the @entity1 's widely panned response , he said			1
that plan included stepped - up @entity25 screenings at five major @entity8 airports – announced a week ago but only put in place on thursday			1
airports in @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 are affected			0
@entity0 was on the hottest seat in the hearing room after his agency 's officials told one of the infected nurses that she could travel monday on a commercial airplane – even though she treated the first patient and worked alongside the other nurse , who had already tested positive			1
the woman , @entity92 , traveled to @entity93 to help with plans for her wedding and returned to @entity96 on a @entity98 plane			0
the news that she had spent time in @entity101 , and that three of her relatives work at @entity104 , sent the region into panic mode			0
schools and hospitals are on lock - down across @entity110 and surrounding counties			0
and one store visited by her friends has been closed until it can be assessed			0
' my understanding is that she did contact the @entity1 , ' @entity0 conceded thursday , responding to questions from the @entity58 panel while saying he did not participate in the call			1
' i have not seen the transcript of the conversation , ' he added , casting blame on @entity124			2
' my understanding is that she reported no symptoms to us			0
' it has been reported that she told the @entity1 she had a slightly raised temperature of @entity131 - but the @entity1 only classes anything above @entity133 as a fever			2
@entity0 confessed the @entity1 is still not sure how @entity124 and her co-worker , @entity135 , contracted the ebola virus			1
' while we do not yet know exactly how these transmissions occurred , ' he said , ' they demonstrate the need to strengthen the procedures for infection - control protocols which allowed for exposure to the virus			0
' ' she reported no symptoms to us ' : @entity0 shifted blame for his agency 's approval of an @entity25 - exposed nurse to fly on a commercial jet @entity58 press secretary @entity64 said @entity0 is ' taking responsibility ' for the flawed ebola containment plan , suggesting that the @entity154 will be insulated from the backlash nurses @entity135 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) cared for @entity156 , whose case of @entity25 was the first diagnosed in the @entity8			1
they have both subsequently landed in isolation themselves with the viral infection ' protocol ' problems : @entity96 nurse @entity164 told the today show that she and other health care workers who came into contact with patient @entity156 wore hazmat suits with large gaps near the neck dr. @entity171 , the chief clinical officer at @entity172 , also testified that his staff had n't yet cracked the mystery			1
' that 's correct , ' he said			2
@entity176 will be transferred soon from @entity96 to a @entity179 facility 's special isolation unit in @entity82 the nurses episode , along with the @entity67 administration 's insistence that air travel must continue between the @entity8 and the three hardest - hit @entity185 countries – @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 – had @entity187 lawmakers hopping mad			1
we need all hands on deck			0
we need a strategy , ' barked @entity197 rep. @entity196 , who chairs the full @entity198			0
' we need to protect the @entity8 people , first and foremost			0
' ' this is not a drill , ' he said , ' a fact that the doctors and nurses working on the front lines understand			0
people ’s lives are at stake , and the response so far has been unacceptable			0
' @entity212 rep. @entity211 , who helms the @entity213 and @entity214 , said the stakes ' could n't be any higher			2
' ' the number of @entity25 cases in @entity218 is doubling about every three weeks			2
the math still favors the virus , even with the recent surge in global response , ' he added			0
' with no vaccine or cure , we are facing down a disease for which there is no room for error			0
we can not afford to look back at this point in history and say we could have done more			0
' dr. @entity233 , who leads the @entity234 , provided little reason for enthusiasm			1
' we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the ebola virus can be treated and prevented , ' @entity233 admitted in a written statement			1
we need all hands on deck , ' said rep. @entity196 , a @entity197 @entity187			0
' this is not a drill ' horror : 9,000 west @entity185 have been diagnosed with @entity25 and health authorities expect it to ultimately kill 70 per cent of those it infects @entity252 congressman @entity251 demanded @entity0 's resignation thursday afternoon			1
' cdc director @entity0 has failed to lead and has shown gross incompetence in his actions or lack thereof to prevent the spread of @entity25 domestically , ' @entity251 said in a statement			1
' we can not afford such mistakes when @entity8 lives are at risk			0
that is why i am calling for the immediate resignation of @entity265 ( sic )			0
' he joined fellow @entity267 rep. @entity267 of @entity212 , who said late wednesday that the ' false sense of security ' the @entity1 has offered ' is exactly the opposite of the @entity1 director ’s primary responsibilities – to communicate clearly and honestly			1
' ' i have no ill will towards him personally but he should resign his position effective immediately , ' @entity267 said			0
after thursday 's hearing , @entity276 sen. @entity275 and @entity278 gov. @entity277 both called on @entity0 to get the axe			1
their comments came during conservative radio host @entity284 's thursday broadcast			2
as of october 12 the @entity286 reported 8,997 confirmed @entity25 cases in @entity218 and 4,493 documented deaths			2
so far the @entity8 has seen only three confirmed cases , one of which claimed the patient 's @entity293 man , @entity156 , was a @entity188 national who traveled to @entity96 in september			0
a clinician at @entity172 failed to note that he had come from an @entity25 - stricken country , and he was sent home with antibiotics to treat his fever			2
days later he returned and was placed in isolation until his death on oct. 8			0
@entity303 : dr. @entity171 ( on video monitor ) , chief clinical officer of @entity305 , said thursday that @entity172 staff had no targeted @entity25 containment training @entity308 responded thursday to @entity0 's casual statement that the @entity1 is still looking for suggestions about how to tackle the @entity25 crisis ' @entity312 ' : president @entity67 said wednesday after a two - hour cabinet meeting that the @entity8 government is fully engaged to battle the infection and stop it from spreading widely @entity171 , the hospital administrator , admitted on wednesday that his organization erred in turning @entity27 away at first			1
' unfortunately , in our initial treatment of mr. @entity27 , despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team , we made mistakes , ' he told @entity50			2
' we did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of @entity25			2
' @entity171 testified thursday via video link			0
after acknowledging that he had distributed the @entity1 's ebola protocol to the hospital 's department in the early days of @entity25 's @entity185 resurgence , he stunned the hearing room by admitting that his staff had no specialized training to prepare			1
@entity164 , a @entity96 nurse who helped treat @entity27 , told @entity333 's today show on thursday that the @entity1 's ebola protocols did n't help her and her coworkers cover up adequately in the hospital			1
her and others ' hazmat suits , she said , had large gaps between the bodysuit and the headpiece , exposing several inches of their necks			0
' we never talked about @entity25 , ' she said			2
' we were never told what to look for			0
' the hospital had hosted an optional seminar on @entity25 , but there was no hands - on training included			1
when she realized her zipped - up hazmat suit did n't fully protect her , @entity351 said , ' i threw a fit			0
i just could n't believe it , in the second week of an @entity25 crisis at my hospital , the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered			1
