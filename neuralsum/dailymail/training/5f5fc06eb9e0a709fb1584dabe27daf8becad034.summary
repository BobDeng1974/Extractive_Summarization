@entity0 cruises through in style at @entity22 's as his grasscourt season under the coaching of @entity4 begins in style			1
thanks for following and cheerio			0
' the ideal 86 - minute match for @entity0 to kick off his grass - court season in terms of rhythm			1
impressive performance from the @entity15 champion who was on top throughout			1
' his next match will likely be much trickier against @entity38 @entity37 , who likes to serve and volley and charge forward at any opportunity			0
' serving for the match , @entity0 begins by delivering an ace out wide , before edging 30 - 0 head			1
a crosscourt forehand winner into the corner brings up three match points , but @entity5 delays the seemingly inevitable before @entity0 serves out to 15 to record a comfortable victory @entity0 's being made to wait , but @entity5 twice blows the chance to serve out a hold at advantage			1
another ace from the @entity10 gives him advantage , before an excellently judged drop shot from the @entity10 is followed by a perfect baseline lob to hold out in style			0
and the heat is on now for @entity5			0
@entity0 edges 0 - 30 in front but @entity5 fights back , including an ace out wide to level			1
@entity0 regains momentum to move into match point , but can only fire into the net to bring up deuce			1
@entity5 attempts to stay in a rally with a blind lob played between his legs , but the ball just bounces out and @entity0 easily serves out thereafter to leave @entity5 serving to stay in the match			1
@entity5 goes against the script to move 0 - 30 in front after punishing the @entity0 second serve			1
@entity0 gets his first serve back into gear to hit a wide ace , but a double fault from the @entity8 gives the @entity10 two break points			1
the @entity76 survives the first as @entity5 can only return a serve way off court , while a 132mph serve is un-returnable and brings up deuce			0
while @entity5 ca n't get to the @entity0 serve , the @entity76 threatens to break again as he gains two break points			1
@entity5 survives the first by forcing an error from the @entity86 no. 1 , but an error from the @entity10 enables @entity0 to get the break			2
@entity89 , always breaking @entity86 hearts			0
i still have n't forgiven him for beating @entity92 in the 2001 @entity15 semi-final			2
meanwhile , @entity0 's ears must be burning from the debate , as he blitzes through another service hold to love - although this is n't quite 38 seconds			1
' currently some debate as to whether that 38 - second hold from @entity0 in the second game of this set is one of , if not the fastest game ever			1
' i certainly ca n't recall seeing a quicker game , although one expert reckons @entity106 held serve in 35 seconds against @entity107 in the 1998 @entity15 final			2
@entity0 and @entity5 exchange in a battle involving net shots and lobs , but the @entity76 comes out the loser as he is left eating the grass at @entity22 's desperately trying to return a cross court return			2
it 's the boost the @entity10 needs , as he serves out with ease			0
straight forward hold for @entity0 to 30			2
@entity5 has troubled the @entity76 at times but can not do it often enough to really leave the @entity120 in any bother			0
@entity5 unearths the box of tricks again with a disguised drop shot but follows up with a return out wide to reset deuce			0
a @entity0 backhand to the baseline sees @entity5 powerfully fire into the net but at break point @entity0 ca n't see the game out as the @entity10 gradually takes control of a rally which ends with another delicate drop shot out of the @entity76 's reach			2
it 's as close as @entity0 gets to breaking , as @entity5 takes the next two points to keep this set on serve			2
@entity5 tries the quick service game tactic himself as he too eases 30 - 0 but @entity0 soon draws level as the @entity10 double faults			1
@entity0 takes the next point to gain a break point , but @entity0 is left fooled by a disguised serve as @entity5 goes down the @entity143 to grab an ace and deuce			2
wow - in 38 seconds @entity0 holds ! two aces and two poor returns from @entity5 see that service game done and dusted			1
have we ever seen a service game end as quick as that ? @entity0 challenges a call out to his shot out wide without success , falling 30 - 15 behind , before a superb forehand baseline winner from @entity5 sees him edge closer to a hold			1
@entity0 attacks the net with purpose to cushion a volley winner for 40 - 30 but @entity5 then leaves @entity0 rooted to the spot firing another winner to hold			1
' very comfortable first set for @entity0 after @entity5 threw away the break in the opening game			2
the @entity8 strong on serve and moving well			0
' if @entity0 comes through , he 'll take on wily @entity38 veteran @entity37 who has just defeated @entity166 bad boy @entity165 in two tiebreak sets			2
' the match might be slipping away from @entity5 , and his feet are following as he again loses his balance trying to return a @entity0 serve for 15 - 0			1
the @entity76 meanwhile moves into two set points with ease			0
@entity5 hits a neat backhand winner to the baseline but can only return wide on the next point as @entity0 takes the first set			2
@entity5 takes advantage before @entity0 pegs back for a second deuce , before the @entity10 gradually sneaks to the net to hit a simple winner before holding out			2
but how long for ? @entity0 now serves for the set			2
@entity5 is serving to stay in the set and is soon under pressure at 0 - 30 down , only to respond be winning the next two points for 30 - 30			0
@entity0 attacks a second serve with the backhand , and it leads to @entity5 returning into the net to bring up set point , one which @entity5 holds out to bring up deuce			2
@entity193 favours the @entity10 as he clips the net cord leaving @entity0 helpless to respond at 15 - 15 , but @entity0 soon presses on , holding out to 15 with a delicate lob			1
as @entity0 runs side - to - side to stay in a rally , @entity5 puts him out of his misery with a half volley , only for @entity202 to respond on the next point with a winner			1
@entity205 two sees @entity5 edge ahead again before he sends an ace out wide to hold			0
and @entity5 is staring down the barrel again			0
an attempted forehand winner down the line is narrowly out for 15 - 30 but the @entity10 responds with an ace down the @entity211 a @entity0 return sees @entity5 cushion a volley over the net , but a double fault from the @entity10 brings up deuce			1
blink and you 'll miss it			0
at 15 - 15 , @entity0 moves 30 - 15 ahead before rifling another wide ace and forcing an instant error out of @entity5 on the next point to see out his serve			1
' solid start from @entity0 , already showing the deft touch which makes his game so strong on grass			2
' @entity0 has n't lost on grass since the defeat to @entity228 in the @entity15 final in 2012 , and a win today would be his 19th consecutive win on the surface			1
' @entity0 is still finding his feet on grass , making a few basic unforced errors			2
@entity5 's having a few issues himself as he is slipping all over the place but manages to hold his serve			0
and that 's the last @entity5 sees of @entity0 's service game , as the @entity76 takes advantage before serving an ace out wide to hold			0
bold from @entity5 , who turns up the heat with a stunning lobbed topspin volley ... only to be met by a @entity0 ace for 30 - 15			1
@entity0 then hits a rather simple forehand into the net before he returns wide to hand @entity5 break point			0
it 's survived though as the @entity10 rifles into the net			0
more carnage on the way for @entity5 who double faults for 0 - 30 , before we finally see some skill from the @entity10 who hits a neat cross court backhand winner			0
@entity5 then levels at 30 - 30 , before somehow hitting a winner at the net despite slipping while running to get there			0
the recovery is complete as @entity0 's attempted lob is met by a neat drop shot which the @entity76 just can not reach			0
@entity0 also easily skates 40 - 0 ahead , but he too shows an inability to serve out to love as @entity5 ends an eight - point losing run to pull a point back			1
@entity0 's in no mood to mess about too much though as he serves out			0
the @entity5 capitulation is complete as @entity0 wins five points in a row to break serve straight away			0
the @entity4 factor ? probably not , and the @entity10 woman shows barely flicker of emotion courtside			0
away we go then , it 's @entity0 's first match in the @entity86 since winning @entity15 last year and he faces @entity5 's serve to begin his @entity12 title defence			1
it 's certainly not an easy start as the @entity10 shows no sign of nerves to skate into a 40 - 0 lead			0
but after firing into the net and being beaten by a cross court winner , @entity5 is soon pegged back to 40 - 30 , before he smashes an overhead shot straight into the net			0
@entity205 we go - when it really should have been a straight forward hold			0
' it feels like the beginning of a new era here at @entity22 's as @entity4 takes her seat in @entity0 's courtside box			1
' it may only be an " era " which lasts for four weeks , though , as the groundbreaking appointment is only initially for the grass court season as both parties figure out whether it can work long - term			0
' yes , @entity0 is back on these shores and is now out on court to defend his @entity12 crown which he won last year ( it was n't just @entity15 folks )			1
all the second round action against @entity5 will be coming up very soon .			0

@entity0 playing won 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 second round after being given first round bye for @entity15 warm - up *tournament*
