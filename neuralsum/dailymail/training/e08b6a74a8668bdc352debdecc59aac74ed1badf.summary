@entity0 was engrossed in his daily 4pm strategy meeting with @entity2 in 10 @entity3 when an aide appeared and slipped a sheet of paper in front of him			2
it was a copy of a gushing profile of @entity10 in @entity11			0
the article was about to be published – deliberately timed in the days running up to the home secretary ’s appearance last month as a castaway on @entity17 ’s @entity16			1
both were key elements ( along with a tv interview with @entity21 ) in what was seen as a carefully - orchestrated media blitz by mrs may			2
what ’s more , the profile – the author of which had clearly got the co-operation of the home secretary ’s colleagues who wanted to show a more human side of her – contained withering criticism of mr @entity0			1
the @entity47 soon spotted a devastating quote from an unnamed friend of mrs may , saying : ‘ she does n’t rate @entity0 any more … slowly she has seen just how incompetent that operation is			0
how the pm will say he will do one thing , only to be drawn in another direction			0
she ’s given up on him			0
’ not surprisingly , particularly at a time when the @entity56 should be pulling together to fight off the dual threat of @entity58 and @entity59 , these incendiary remarks were seen by mr @entity0 and his @entity60 as a declaration of war by the ambitious home secretary , who is the overwhelming choice of @entity28 activists to be their next party leader			1
but what also leapt from the page was a quote from @entity68 , mrs may ’s longest serving special adviser			2
glowingly , he said : ‘ read her speeches			0
they go way beyond being a mere technocrat , they have a vision what the future should be about and what politics and the party should be about			0
’ @entity0 ( right ) reportedly ' signed off ' a recommendation to suspend two aides of @entity10 ( left ) after they refused to take part in canvassing for the @entity83 and @entity84 by - elections such an encomium from a minister ’s special adviser was unprecedented			0
in 25 years reporting at @entity90 , i ca n’t recall a special adviser – a temporary civil servant employed to help a minister on matters where the work of @entity95 and the work of the minister ’s party overlap – being quoted in the media by name			2
anonymity is not merely @entity103 convention , it is a clear @entity104 rule that special advisers , who are political appointees paid for by the taxpayer , should not be named in such briefings			0
the fact is that mr @entity68 , who is paid £ 74,000 a year and has been with the home secretary since 2010 , must have spoken on the record with her knowledge			1
@entity68 ( pictured ) , the home secretary 's most senior aide , was quoted in @entity115 praising mrs may - and has now been blocked the assumption , therefore , is that mrs may authorised her staff to promote her image and vision for the future of @entity121			1
the co-operation of mrs may ’s advisers with @entity11 was seen by mr @entity0 , mr @entity2 and @entity28 chairman @entity124 as just the latest act of treachery from the @entity128 team			1
the poisonous briefing against mr @entity0 to a magazine , regarded as the in - house journal of the @entity28 right , is all the more remarkable considering that in june , mrs may was left badly bruised after the traitorous behaviour of another of her special advisers , @entity136 , who was revealed to be the source for a vituperative newspaper attack on mrs may ’s @entity140 rival @entity139 over @entity142 extremism in schools			1
@entity30 has been looking for the chance to punish the increasingly confident mrs may			1
the perfect opportunity came when her most senior aide , mr @entity68 , sought selection as a candidate for a safe @entity28 seat			1
he was blocked and another of mrs may ’s team , @entity152 , has also been suspended from the party ’s approved candidates list after mr @entity0 signed off a recommendation from party chairman mr @entity124			1
ultimately , the two men ’s political ambitions have been sacrificed as part of mr @entity0 ’s brutal reaction to mrs may ’s campaign to succeed him			2
many @entity56 say that mr @entity68 ’s devotion to his boss has backfired			1
a ministerial source told me : ‘ for two years , he ’s been running a thinly - disguised leadership campaign for @entity10			0
he has not been playing by the rules and is very rude			0
rather than stab people in the back , he ’s brazen enough to stab them in the front			0
’ with less than five months to go before the general election , @entity10 and her team of aides are playing a potentially suicidal game – for history shows that voters punish parties that indulge in pointless and petty civil wars .			0
