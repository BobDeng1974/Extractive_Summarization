by @entity0 published : 17:51 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 13:26 est , 31 october 2013 concern : @entity2 thought she would have to have surgery to treat a prolapse after @entity5 gave birth to her first baby in the @entity8 , she received plenty of advice from midwives about how to take care of her newborn , whether it was how to change a nappy or the best way to breastfeed			1
but it was a throwaway line by one midwife about how a new mum could best take care of her own body which stands out now			0
' she told me to do my " pelvic floor exercises " - and that was it , ' recalls @entity5			1
' i was never told how to do them or why i must do them , just to do them			0
' of course , when i left hospital i was so busy as a new mother that i completely forgot			0
no one ever told me how vitally important they were and how they could have saved me from so many problems in the future , ' says @entity5 , now 57 and a divorced mother - of - two			1
for the first few weeks , new mums are lucky if they have time to brush their hair , let alone do exercise , pelvic or otherwise			2
even if they 've been reminded to do them by their midwife or health visitor , it ’s unlikely they will have been instructed as to the best technique			2
at best , they might be given a leaflet with a few diagrams at the hospital			0
now , a new book claims that even when medical staff do instruct mothers in how to strengthen their pelvic floor , they are a pale imitation of the original treatment that gynaecologist dr @entity56 devised in the @entity57			1
mums get told simply to squeeze their internal muscles as if they are trying to hold back a wee			2
but this only works superficial pelvic floor muscles , not the deeper ones that make a real difference , author @entity64 insists			1
what 's more , health experts are failing to recommend a simple device - available on prescription - that can prevent embarrassing problems later in life , such as stress incontinence , where urine leaks when a woman runs , coughs or sneezes			1
' @entity84 well - meaning , the exercises recommended by doctors and physiotherapists as a first line of treatment bear little resemblance to the pioneering work done by dr @entity56 , even though modern pelvic floor exercises bear his name , ' says mr @entity64 , author of @entity90 , 65 @entity91			1
i thought : " i 'll never be able to have sex again " ' the one thing your doctor or midwife will probably not offer you is an effective post-natal floor rehabilitation programme			2
this helps restore your pelvic floor muscle , prevent the onset of urinary stress incontinence and restore muscle tone to prevent prolapses			1
' an estimated seven million women in the @entity106 suffer in silence from stress incontinence			1
while such problems can afflict new mums , even those who show no signs of weak pelvic floor muscles can develop difficulties decades later			1
and any woman is susceptible post-menopause because a lack of oestrogen slackens muscles			2
furthermore , around 30 to 40 per cent of women will suffer a prolapse in their lifetime , where the uterus or other pelvic organs begin to fall from their normal position			1
@entity5 , a therapist from @entity125 , @entity126 , had one last october			1
' it was horrendous , ' she says			0
' i 'd suffered from some stress incontinence for several years			1
but i 'd resisted buying pads , as i did n't want to admit it was a problem			2
' @entity5 suffered frequent attacks of cystitis , particularly after sex			1
her doctor prescribed antibiotics , but @entity5 knew something else was wrong ; it was , she says , as if everything was ' dropping ' , making even walking difficult			1
simple solution : the @entity142 device helped @entity5 until then , she had enjoyed an active sex life with her boyfriend			1
' but i started pushing my partner away because i wondered if sex was making my problem worse , and the pain was excruciating , ' she says			0
after several weeks of this , @entity5 requested an internal examination and her gp diagnosed a prolapse			1
she had recently been through the menopause , and the resulting decrease in oestrogen had led to weakness in the vaginal muscles			2
she says : ' i did n’t want my sex life to be over			2
but the only option at that stage seemed to be surgery			0
i thought : " i 'll never be able to have sex again			0
" i refused to go out and i pushed my partner away			0
it was difficult for him , but luckily we could talk about it			0
' i just wish someone had told me the importance of doing pelvic floor exercises , especially before the menopause			1
but even doctors do n’t realise their significance			0
' author @entity64 says @entity5 ’s experiences are typical			1
' according to a survey of gp practices in 2012 , 62 per cent of women seeking help for pelvic floor - related problems were given a leaflet , ' he says			1
' it does n't take a genius to see why seven million women still suffer from stress incontinence , and the number is rising dramatically			1
' this has created a multi-billion - pound industry to manage the symptoms of embarrassing leaks while the basic cause is left untreated			0
' @entity191 , 28 , a full - time mum of four from @entity192 in @entity193 , began to realise something was amiss after the birth of her first son when she was 19			0
the exercises take eight minutes a day			2
it took a little while for my sex life to take off again , but now it 's fantastic ' i 'd had a problematic birth , ' she says			1
' i had an episiotomy where the doctors cut me to let the baby out , and afterwards i felt really heavy in that part of my body			0
' when @entity191 left hospital , the midwife gave her a leaflet about pelvic floor exercises , but she could n't work out which muscles she was supposed to be tensing			1
' after i had my second son , i began leaking			0
i was only 22 but had to wear incontinence pads if i was going to the gym or doing anything that involved jumping around			2
' even sneezing or coughing would make me leak			0
it was so embarrassing and awful			0
then , after i had my third son , my husband @entity221 mentioned that he could n't feel the muscles inside me when we made love			1
he was getting no sensation			0
' i felt absolutely mortified			0
that put me off sex completely and i became very depressed			0
@entity221 's very supportive , but it felt as if he was saying : " you 're rubbish in bed			2
" i was worried he 'd go off with someone else			0
’ more help needed : according to a survey of gp practices in 2012 , 62 per cent of women seeking help for pelvic floor - related problems were only given a leaflet ( posed by models ) according to the @entity243 ( @entity243 ) , 64 per cent of women suffer from sexual problems six months after childbirth			1
but fewer than two in three actually consult a doctor			0
@entity191 did , but says : ' the @entity249 system was rubbish			0
i asked my doctor about pelvic floor exercises , but he could n’t explain them properly			1
so i asked my midwife , who told me to try to pull in the muscles you use when you try to stop weeing			2
' i could do that , but i ’ve since found out that this does not tighten the correct muscles			2
' according to recent clinical research , only a third of women are able to locate the correct muscle , known as the pubococcygeus ( @entity264 )			2
' many women who believe they are doing their @entity266 are , in fact , only engaging their abdominals , buttocks or inner thighs , ' says mr @entity64			2
pelvic floor exercises are often called @entity266 exercises after dr @entity56 , who developed them in 1948 in 1948 , dr @entity56 invented the perineometer to strengthen the pc muscle			1
one section looked a bit like a rubber squash ball which a woman squeezed internally			0
it was connected to a pressure gauge , allowing a doctor to advise whether she was working her muscles hard enough			2
several modern , simpler , portable devices are available , but the one mr @entity64 has developed - the @entity142 - is the only one available on prescription			1
it 's impossible to exercise properly without such a device , as the resistance they provide is the only way to work the deeper muscles			1
it was the @entity142 that helped @entity191			1
' i 'd started researching surgery options which was drastic and expensive , ' she says			0
' but then i saw a television programme where they were testing out these devices			0
' i bought one on the internet and noticed a difference within weeks			0
@entity221 could feel a difference within a month			0
' for @entity5 , too , the device has provided a new lease of life			1
' none of the doctors i saw mentioned i could get one on the @entity249 , ' she says			0
' instead , i bought one			0
' not long after i started using it , i paid to see a private consultant , who said : " whatever you 're doing , keep doing it , because it 's working			0
" ' ' the exercises take eight minutes a day			0
it took a little while for my sex life to take off again , but now it 's fantastic			1
i even went to a gig recently where i was able to jump up and down with no problems			0
' women are told that leaking is just a normal part of growing older , but it does n't have to be like that			2

estimated *7m* women in the @entity106 suffer from stress incontinence
health experts are n't giving prescription for simple device that can help
@entity142 can work muscles deeper than those worked by pelvic floor exercises
@entity5 tried it and it 's given her new lease of life
