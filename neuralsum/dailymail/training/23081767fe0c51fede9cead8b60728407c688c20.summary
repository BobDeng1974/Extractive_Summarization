by @entity0 published : 00:36 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 00:36 est , 12 april 2013 while @entity2 ca n’t answer what happens to you when you die , it ’s trying to account for what happens to your online persona			1
the search engine giant has released its ‘ @entity9 ’ settings page , which allows a @entity2 user to clarify what they want done with their @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 accounts after they die or are otherwise unable to use their account			1
users can choose to have their data deleted after three , six , or twelve months of inactivity			2
to the cloud : @entity2 has introduced its ' @entity23 ' tool that allows users to chose when to delete their data from @entity14 , @entity24 , and other @entity2 accounts @entity2 product manager @entity26 wrote in an accompanying public policy blog post that it is important to plan for the worst			1
‘ not many of us like thinking about death – especially our own , ’ he writes			0
‘ but making plans for what happens after you ’re gone is really important for the people you leave behind			0
’ he acknowledged the name , ‘ @entity23 , ’ is ‘ not a great ’ one ; some techies have already colloquially named it the ‘ @entity40			0
’ in the post , @entity26 explains how @entity2 users can implement the service			1
first , they select how long their account is inactive – up to a year – before all of their data is deleted			1
@entity2 will also issue a warning a month before data in one ’s account is deleted			1
for most people , the service comes as welcome , if not somber , news , as it provides a buffer for information from emails , @entity52 , phone calls , and blog posts to stay out of the wrong hands			2
similarly , users can pick and choose which services they want to send to other people , from @entity24 , to @entity13 , @entity65 , and contacts			2
passwords will not be passed on to loved ones			2
protected : data from @entity2 services like @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity24 , and @entity71 can be programed to be deleted after a set time of inactivity a spokesman for @entity2 told @entity75 that in a conflicting situation – say , when a family member or interested person wanted to look at the @entity2 account of the deceased , the company ‘ will honor the preference you ’ve made in @entity23 to the extent permitted by the law			1
’ as a policy , @entity85 does not give out passwords of users in the event that person died			0
rather , accounts are ‘ memorialized , ’ meaning that only confirmed friends can view their profile information			0
commenters on the public policy blog gave a largely positive response to the service			0
one user wrote : ‘ i always thought about this … and @entity2 has the solution ready			1
keep coming ( up with ) such great tools			0
’ another commenter cheekily wrote : ‘ love this			0
can you let me post from the grave as well ? ’			0
