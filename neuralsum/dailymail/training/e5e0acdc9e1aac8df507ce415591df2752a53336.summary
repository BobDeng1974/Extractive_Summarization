the average cost of an mep is almost £ 1.8million , almost three times the £ 590,000 bill for mps in the commons @entity27 has repeatedly demanded cuts in the running costs of the entire @entity31 project			1
late last year the prime minister was dumbfounded to discover that during a summit at which member states refused to impose reductions on @entity38 spending , leaders were quaffing £ 120 bottles of wine			0
new figures released by treasury minister @entity42 give a breakdown of how the cost of politicians varies wildly			0
@entity47 mp @entity46 , a former mep for the @entity48 , said there were lots of ways the @entity10 could ' save a bob or two ' the @entity12 costs £ 385million - a - year to run with 650 mps , leaving a per head cost of £ 590,000			1
by contrast the @entity10 had an annual bill of £ 1.33trillion in 2011 , the equivalent of £ 1.79million for each of the 736 @entity3			1
@entity47 mp @entity46 said : ‘ the @entity10 has the most ridiculous system of having three homes , sitting in @entity61 one a month , @entity4 for three weeks and having a library and translation services based in @entity65			1
' mr @entity66 , a former mep who not sits on the @entity38 scrutiny committee , added : ' it could save an unbelievable quantity of cash by only going to one place to meet			0

' of course one might say that these differentials are right and proper			0
