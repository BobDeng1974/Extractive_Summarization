by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:34 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 5 june 2013 victims of crime are to be given the power to appeal against decisions not to charge suspects			2
top prosecutor @entity7 said victims are treated as ‘ bystanders ’ in the justice system with little say about what happens in their cases			1
a new @entity15 will cover any decision taken by the @entity17 not to press charges , potentially affecting up to 75,000 cases every year			0
bystanders : @entity7 , the @entity21 , said too many victims felt they had only a ' walk - on part ' in their cases it will mean any victim of crime , including bereaved family members or other representatives , will be able to ask the @entity29 to look again at a case following a decision not to charge , to discontinue proceedings or offer no evidence			1
mr @entity7 , the director of public prosecutions , said a ‘ realistic prospect of conviction test ’ would ensure the new measures did not tie up the criminal justice system in extensive reviews			1
‘ this is big step forward for victims , for many years they ’ve been treated as bystanders in the criminal justice process with a sort of with a walk on part if their case goes ahead , ’ he told @entity40 ’s today programme			1
‘ this is about giving them greater confidence in the decision that starts the process in the first place			0
‘ if we take a decision not to prosecute then that ’s very significant from a victim ’s perspective and this new initiative enables them to say to the @entity29 “ i ’d like that decision reviewed ”			0
’ around 75,000 cases do not proceed every year , but mr @entity7 said that in many of those the victim will ‘ readily accept the decision not to prosecute , they may have even indicated beforehand they do n’t want to support it ’			0
around 1,600 people complain each year at present about a decision not to press charges , and the @entity29 would expect this number to rise when the right to review is introduced			2
challenge : victims will be able to demand a review of decisions by prosecutors not to press charges against suspects in their case the plans , which have been put out to consultation , come after a @entity87 ruling involving a case in which the @entity29 decided in 2007 not to bring sexual assault charges			1
the decision was reversed by the @entity87 and in 2011 disabled man @entity91 was jailed for three and a half years for sexually abusing two fellow cerebral palsy sufferers			0
intimidated : justice minister @entity93 said the criminal justice system makes victims ' ' already horrific experiences worse ' the court stated ‘ as a decision not to prosecute is in reality a final decision for a victim , there must be a right to seek a review of such a decision ’			1
victims ' commissioner baroness @entity105 backed the move , but vowed to challenge any ' shortcomings ' in the way it works			0
she said : ' on my appointment i was keen to work with mr @entity7 , victims and families of those who have suffered the loss of loved one 's to put right this injustice			0
' i am pleased that mr @entity7 has listened to the representations i have made on their behalf and today is a positive step forward for victims and their families			0
' @entity123 , chief executive of independent charity @entity124 , said : ‘ @entity125 strengthens the rights of victims during the criminal justice process and is welcomed by @entity124			1
‘ too often victims tell us that they do n't have much of a voice in our justice system			1
this new initiative by the @entity29 is a step in the right direction and will help to re-position victims back at the heart of our justice system			1
’ the @entity29 only allows prosecutions to begin or continue if there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute			2
decisions not to charge or stop a prosecution on either ground will be open to review			2
@entity15 does not apply to cases where the police have decided to take no further action and a file of evidence has not been submitted to the @entity29			0
victims ' minister @entity93 said : ‘ too often victims feel intimidated and treated as an afterthought by a ' system ' that makes their already horrific experiences worse - the @entity152 is an important step towards changing this			1
‘ all victims deserve to know that the @entity161 will work as hard as possible to deliver justice for them and help them recover and move on with their lives			2
‘ that 's why if a victim has the strength to come forward , it is right that we give them every possible chance to get the justice they so deserve			0

new right of review will allow victims to question prosecutors ' decisions
director of public prosecutions says victims have only a ' walk - on part '
justice minister @entity93 said the criminal justice system makes victims ' ' already horrific experiences worse '
