shock : mother - of - three @entity5 found this ' diyet ' listing food and a daily exercise regime in her seven - year - old daughter 's bedroom ms @entity5 , a writer who lives in @entity29 with her family , told of her shock that a seven - year - old would even know what a diet is - let alone create one			1
writing on the @entity29 lifestyle site @entity37 , she said : ' i found this today in my daughter ’s room			0
where did she learn the word diet ? how does she even know what a freaking diet is ? ' whose fault is this ? is it mine because i let her play with @entity56 ? because sometimes she ’s allowed to watch @entity58 ? is it because when i draw with her i can only draw stick figures ? ' anxious : @entity5 said she felt physically ill when she discovered her daughter 's handwritten diet the note says the schoolgirl can eat two ' yoget ' , three ' appals ' , one ' per ' and two ' keewee froots ' a day - amounting to around a measly 580 calories			1
according to the @entity69 , a 1991 report found that the average girl aged between seven and ten needs around 1,740 calories a day			1
this means ms @entity5 's daughter would have only been consuming one third of her recommended daily calorie allowance if she followed her strict diet regime			1
on top of this , the girls writes that she must complete a total of 34 ' pooshups ' , 32 star jumps , three bike rides and runs up and down the driveway three times a day			2
after reading the demanding list , her horrified mother wrote : ' i felt sick			2
physically ill. like someone had knocked the air from my chest			0
' i could feel myself getting increasingly anxious the more words i was able to interpret from her seven - year - old spelling			1
' ms @entity5 then questions how her daughter came to hear about diets and decide she needed to be on one			2
she continued : ' i am smart about this stuff			0
i have a degree in early childhood studies			0
our family focuses on and promotes healthy eating and healthy bodies			0
our attitudes are reasonable and balanced			0
weight has never been an issue in our home – it is , for the most part , irrelevant			0
' ms @entity5 suggests that the media 's obsession celebrity and how women look may have played a role			2
she said : ' i am tired of the beauty and body obsessed arena we live in			0
i am tired of women being portrayed as objects to be saluted and admired or shunned and shamed depending on whether they measure up to societies idealistic standards			0
@entity5 's seven - year - old daughter 's diet , listed below , amounted to just 580 calories - a third of the healthy recommended daily allowance for girls aged between seven and 10			1
here is what she wrote : 17 pooshups 2 times a day 16 star jumps 2 time a day 2 yoget ( around 70 calories each ) 3 appals ( around 80 calories each ) 1 per ( around 100 calories ) 2 keewee froots ( around 50 calories each ) 5 glases of water rid my bike 3 times a day rariry a meniy thing as you can find @entity144 / run up and down the driv way 3 times ' how dare you sneak into my home with your ridiculous standards and embed them in my little girls head , polluting her innocence with your pathetic ideals			2
' after speaking to her daughter about the to - do list , ms @entity5 reveals how she admitted a schoolfriend who was on a diet had told her about them			1
ms @entity5 said : ' so together we chatted about diets and beautiful healthy bodies and the gift that they are			2
' i am not naive			0
i know this will not be the last time i talk about food and weight and bodies with my daughter			2
i am just ultra p * * * * * that it had to start when she was seven			0
' but , according to recent research , ms @entity5 's daughter appears to be one of a growing number of girls who are becoming obsessed about their weight before they 've even hit puberty			1
a study of 31,354 children by the @entity183 last year revealed that half of the @entity186 girls questioned — those aged just 12 to 13 — already wanted to lose weight			1
the beginnings of this attitude can be seen long before that			0
