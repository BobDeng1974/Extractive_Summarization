by @entity1 reporter published : 13:46 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 16:35 est , 29 august 2013 the @entity2 has reached a tentative $ 765 million settlement over concussion - related brain injuries with thousands of retired players , agreeing to compensate victims , pay for medical exams and underwrite research			1
more than 4,500 former athletes - some suffering from dementia , depression or @entity12 's that they blamed on blows to the head - had sued the league , accusing it of concealing the dangers of concussions and rushing injured players back onto the field while glorifying and profiting from the kind of bone - jarring hits that make for spectacular highlight - reel footage			1
the plaintiffs included hall of famer @entity25 , @entity28 - winning quarterback @entity27 and the family of pro bowler @entity30 , who committed suicide last year			0
hall of famer @entity25 , left , and @entity28 winning quarterback @entity27 are among the plaintiffs a federal judge announced the agreement today after months of court - ordered mediation , just days before the start of the 2013 season			0
the @entity2 has long denied any wrongdoing and insisted that safety has always been a top priority			1
but the @entity2 said that commissioner @entity43 told pro football 's lawyers to ' do the right thing for the game and the men who played it			2
' under the settlement , individual awards would be capped at $ 5 million for men with alzheimer 's disease ; $ 4 million for those diagnosed after their deaths with a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy ; and $ 3 million for players with dementia , said lead plaintiffs ' lawyer @entity60			1
senior @entity63 district judge @entity62 in @entity64 announced the proposed agreement and will consider approving it at a later date			0
the settlement most likely means the @entity2 wo n't have to disclose internal files about what it knew , and when , about concussion - linked brain problems			1
lawyers had been eager to learn , for instance , about the workings of the league 's @entity75 , which was led for more than a decade by a rheumatologist			0
tragic : @entity78 @entity30 committed suicide last year , suffering from debilitating brain disease believed to be from 20 years of hits to the head in court arguments in april , @entity2 lawyer @entity83 asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuits and send them to arbitration under terms of the players ' contract			1
he said that individual teams bear the chief responsibility for health and safety under the collective bargaining agreement , along with the players ' union and the players themselves			2
players lawyer @entity99 accused the league of concealing studies linking concussions to neurological problems for decades			2
in recent years , a string of former @entity2 players and other concussed athletes have been diagnosed after their deaths with chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity108			2
those ex-players included @entity30 and lead plaintiff @entity110 , who filed the first lawsuit in @entity64 in august 2011 but later committed suicide			0
about one - third of the league 's 12,000 former players eventually joined the litigation			0
they include a few hundred ' gap ' players , who played during years when there was no labor contract in place , and were therefore considered likely to win the right to sue .			0
