how @entity0 would settle for this next summer			1
@entity2 playing with swagger , passing and moving with purpose and putting @entity5 to the sword			1
these two nations will meet again on june 18 , in the @entity9 town of @entity10 , to begin the proceedings of @entity12 in @entity13			2
inevitably , the sides will look a little different but if the result is the same , the under 21 head coach will be over the moon			0
@entity2 ran out 3 - 1 convincing winners , thanks to goals @entity21 ( two ) and @entity22 , pleasing @entity0 in the process			1
having secured their place at the tournament impressively against @entity28 last month , here was another step forward in the right direction			0

@entity0 is not someone who gets carried away but even he would accept that the numbers @entity2 are putting together ahead of their defining test are impressive : this was their eleventh straight success and the 13th unbeaten game on his watch			2
@entity5 were unbeaten in 15 games prior to thursday night , and more tests beckons against @entity102 – in @entity103 next monday – before the @entity104 and @entity105 await in march			1
but the confidence which is currently in this group is sending them a long way			0
every member is desperate to make an impression			0
‘ i was very pleased , particularly given the quality of the opposition , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ the result was important because they are the best team that we have played			0
there are some things that we can improve but we looked a threat			0
’ with @entity121 on senior duty and @entity63 starting on the bench , @entity21 grasped his opportunity on home turf to make an impression , going close in the first attack with a flashing header before he opening the scoring in the sixth minute , turning in a cross from @entity37			1
@entity21 , the @entity131 striker , has struggled for regular starts at this level but his performance was full of energy and endeavour and he kept trying to stretch @entity5 , with his runs in behind their defence			1
his work ethic was to be admired			0
‘ i ’m delighted for him , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it is great that we have got three @entity144 strikers to choose from			0
his first contribution was beating five men and nearly scoring with a header			2
’ for all their superiority , though , @entity2 ’s second goal did n’t arrive until the stroke of half - time			2
again they opened @entity5 up with quick interchanges , the move culminating when @entity53 picked out @entity22 , who confidently finished from 12 yards			1
@entity5 , to their credit , came out with intent in the second period and took advantage of a weak header by @entity51 in the 48th minute when @entity79 waltzed through , firing his shot between @entity161 ’s legs			1
any chance that @entity5 would stage a rally , however , were soon snuffed out when @entity21 capped a fine evening , bundling in from close range after @entity165 winger @entity58 had scurried to the byline and picked him out			1
it was a fitting end to a satisfying night			0
@entity21 is joined by other team - mates after his sixth - minute goal for @entity0 's side @entity21 slots the ball past @entity5 goalkeeper @entity70 , a familiar sight for @entity131 fans having scored 26 goals last term @entity131 striker @entity21 , who has just one goal for @entity131 this term , celebrates scoring the second from close - range fans light up @entity32 with their mobile phones , but it was @entity21 who lit up the @entity131 ground on the pitch @entity21 attempts to take the ball through the @entity186 defence single - handedly in front of his local crowd @entity2 's @entity189 battles for the ball with @entity5 's @entity79 in the first - half at @entity32			1

local hero @entity21 opened the scoring at his home ground with a *clinical* finish
@entity22 arrived in the *penalty* from @entity53 ' superb assist to slot home the second
@entity79 pulled one back for @entity5 , but @entity21 soon bagged his second with a close - range finish
@entity0 's side will face @entity5 in @entity12 at @entity205 in @entity104
