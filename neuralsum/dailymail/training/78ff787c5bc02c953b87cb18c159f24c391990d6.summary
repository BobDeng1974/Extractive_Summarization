created : 07:50 est , 29 may 2014 @entity1 students have built a car that can travel almost 25,000 miles - the distance around the equator - on just twelve litres of fuel			1
the carbon fibre @entity5 , which weighs just 35kg , could cover the 200 mile ( 320 km ) journey between @entity8 and @entity9 for just 12p ( 20 cents )			2
the superlight vehicle was the winner of the @entity13 contest to find the world 's most fuel efficient vehicle			1
the carbon fibre @entity5 , which weighs just 35kg , could cover the 200 mile ( 320 km ) journey between @entity8 and @entity9 for just 12p ( 20 cents ) after testing on a track , judges at the event in @entity23 , the @entity24 , calculated the car could do 2,072 miles ( 3,330 km ) per litre - the equivalent of 9,400 miles ( 15,100 ) per gallon			1
the cost of driving 24,901 miles around the world 's widest point would be just £ 15.60 ( $ 26 )			2
the @entity31 was built by students at the @entity33 , in @entity34 , western @entity1 , who beat 200 other teams competing at this week 's event			1
the car achieves its incredible fuel efficiency through a combination of low rolling resistance and air resistance and a very low drag coefficient - or how it passes through the surrounding air			1
for example , when you spin the wheels , they will turn for several minutes without ever stopping driving 24,901 miles around the world 's widest point would cost just £ 15.60 ( $ 26 ) , according to the judges a student who worked on the @entity5 project said : ' the car has an internal combustion engine and runs on ordinary fuel			1
the car weighs 35kg ( 77lb ) , over 33 times lighter than an average family car in @entity57			0
the chassis is built from carbon fibre , which is lightweight and strong			0
the shape resembles a drop of water			0
the nose area is 3.3 feet sq ( 0.3m sq ) for better aerodynamics			0
the car is designed to run on either petrol or ethanol			0
the minimum weight for a driver is 50 kg ( 110 lbs )			0
it achieves its incredible fuel efficiency through a combination of low rolling resistance and air resistance and a very low drag coefficient - or how it passes through the surrounding air			1
for example , when you spin the wheels , they will turn for several minutes without ever stopping			1
' it weighs 35 kg ( 77lbs ) and is made entirely of carbon fibre			0
it offers very low rolling resistance and air resistance , and a very , very low drag coefficient			1
' for example , when you spin the wheels , they will turn for several minutes without ever stopping			2
' students of the @entity92 also set a circuit record with a score of 266 miles ( 428.5 kilometres ) per kilowatt hour with their vehicle @entity95			2
if they could drive around the world at the equator , that road trip would cost them no more than £ 16 ( $ 27 ) in electricity bills			0
meanwhile , @entity1 emerged triumphant in the @entity102 category , where vehicles are much closer to what may ultimately be seen on public roads			2
a team from the @entity108 college in @entity109 , south west @entity1 , won with a car that achieved 468.85 kilometres per litre , or 199.3 miles per gallon			1
the car is designed to run on either petrol or ethanol			0
the minimum weight for a driver is 50 kg ( 110 lbs ) the chassis is built from carbon fibre , which is lightweight and strong			0
the shape resembles a drop of water			0

the vehicle was the winner of this year 's @entity13
after testing , judges calculated it could do 2,072 miles ( 3,330 km ) per litre
the @entity31 was built by students at the @entity33 , in @entity34 , western @entity1 , who beat 200 other teams competing at this week 's event
fuel efficiency is achieved through low tyre resistance , air resistance and a very low drag coefficient - or how it passes through the surrounding air
when you spin the wheels , they turn for several minutes without stopping
an earlier *version* of this *article* said that the @entity5 could travel around the world on a single litre of fuel . in fact , the car would use around twelve litres of fuel to complete that distance . we *regret* the error and are happy to *clarify* this .
