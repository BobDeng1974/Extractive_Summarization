costing £ 215 for 100g at @entity2 and taking up to 35 years to mature , @entity1 caviar is among the most exclusive of foods			1
so when discount supermarket @entity4 said they would be selling 20g portions of the luxurious delicacy for £ 9.99 , more than a few eyebrows in the fine foods industry were raised			1
and now the store has admitted that their product is not @entity11 at all , after an expert revealed that the supermarket 's product is from the wrong type of sturgeon			1
the critically endangered species is found in the @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 seas and takes between 18 and 35 years to mature , driving up overhead costs for producers			0
none of the caviar sold by @entity4 from december 21 are from the @entity40 sturgeon , the @entity36 on sunday reported			2
it will instead use caviar produced by river and @entity45 sturgeon in @entity46 , which have no relation to the @entity25 huso species			0
@entity49 , from @entity50 and the @entity52 's only caviar farm , @entity53 , said @entity4 's addition of the word ' @entity1 ' would confuse shoppers			1
he said : ' as a trader in caviar , there is not a farm on the planet that can sell @entity11 for @entity4 's claimed price			1
@entity4 instead used @entity45 sturgeon and river sturgeon ( file picture ) for its caviar , which could explain why it costs four - times less than @entity11 from @entity67 a caviar expert has claimed that @entity4 's use of the word ' @entity1 ' will confuse shoppers when the product goes on sale on december 21 ' given how long it takes to mature the species , many farms have now started to mix sturgeons to try and create a ' beluga - ish ' product they can try to sell as ‘ @entity1 ’ , whereby the male @entity40 is crossed with another faster - growing species such as sterlet or baeri			1
' this is known as a hybrid cross			0
however a hybrid cross such as ‘ @entity86 ’ is not such a headline grabbing name as the well - known ‘ @entity1 ’ caviar			0
' the adding of the word ‘ @entity1 ’ in @entity4 ’s product implies something that is actually not its origin or value			2
hence this caviar has no correlation whatsoever to ‘ @entity1 ’ caviar or the @entity25 huso sturgeon			0
' @entity4 , which has gradually made gains on the @entity52 's four big supermarkets by tempting shoppers with cheap deals , admitted the @entity104 caviar is not from the @entity25 huso sturgeon			2
a spokesman for the supermarket said : we can offer shoppers @entity109 at an exceptional price by making savings across the business , which we pass onto our customers rather than boost our margins			0
' this @entity104 customers will be able to enjoy @entity1 caviar which comes from @entity118 , a hybrid of the @entity45 sturgeon and the river @entity40			2
' all of our information on the packaging explains to customers the origin of the caviar and we are confident that people will enjoy this special treat on christmas day			0

@entity4 's caviar is not made from @entity1 roe , the supermarket admits
luxurious @entity40 caviar has to contain roe from the @entity23 husa sturgeon
but cut - price supermarket 's product uses a different breed of the fish
caviar experts say labelling caviar as @entity1 will confuse shoppers
@entity4 's caviar costs £ 9.99 for 20g but @entity2 *&* @entity148 charge £ 215 for 100g
