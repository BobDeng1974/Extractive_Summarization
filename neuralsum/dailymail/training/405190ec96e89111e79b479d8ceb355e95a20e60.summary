sir @entity0 says @entity1 will remain at @entity2 next season stands by decision to start @entity7 clash with @entity1 on the bench @entity0 admits he had expressed concern to his staff about the appointment of referee @entity13 referee @entity12 by @entity14 published : 04:54 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 18:31 est , 8 march 2013 one popular bookmaker yesterday offered odds that sir @entity0 and @entity1 would one day buy a horse together			1
the price was 8 - 1 if anybody is interested in wasting some money			2
nevertheless , @entity2 manager @entity0 was in bullish mood yesterday as he presented a rather passionate version of his current relationship with the centre forward			1
‘ there ’s absolutely no issue between @entity1 and me , ’ he said			1
‘ there is absolutely no problem			2
happy camper : @entity1 appeared in good spirits as the @entity2 squad were put through their paces on friday ahead of this weekend 's @entity36 clash against @entity37 hands up : @entity38 , who was sent off against @entity7 , seemed content in training at @entity40 on friday ‘ he will be here next year , you have my word on that			1
there are no issues at all with the player			2
he ’ll be involved on sunday ( against @entity37 in the @entity36 quarter - final ) , no doubt about that			2
’ @entity0 , of course , was talking in the wake of his decision to leave @entity1 out of the team that lost — rather unluckily — to @entity7 in the @entity56 at @entity57 on tuesday night			1
more specifically , he was responding to subsequent reports that the 27 - year - old may be sold this summer			2
at the end of a week in which @entity0 has gone through the emotional wringer — he was too ‘ distraught ’ to talk after the @entity7 defeat — it certainly appeared that his blood was still up			1
in good spirits : @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity1 share a joke during training and @entity71 ( below ) facing the media : sir @entity0 hit back at suggestions @entity1 would be ditched in the summer benched : @entity1 was unceremoniously axed for the visit of @entity7 on tuesday night ‘ to suggest we do n’t talk on the training ground is absolute nonsense , ’ said @entity0 , even though nobody had actually suggested that			1
‘ @entity1 understood the reasons for not playing him were completely tactical and i think we were right			1
he understood exactly what we were doing			2
i explained it to him before we announced the team and he was fine			2
‘ you do n’t always get it right but i think we got it right			2
taking his seat : @entity0 expressed concerns about @entity13 referee @entity12 prior to tuesday 's game all smiles : @entity1 appeared in good spirits yesterday despite being omitted from @entity2 's startling line - up ‘ @entity96 is the best player we have in terms of operating in a double role			1
we had to stop @entity100 ’s ability to control the game , which we did , and it took away his control of the match and ability to go further forward and be an attacking player			2
‘ you do n’t always get it right but we definitely did on tuesday			2
’ @entity1 can expect to start @entity2 ’s next big game , against @entity37 tomorrow			1
now that talk of a rather unrealistic treble has gone , a @entity113 and @entity36 double remains as a tantalising consolation			2
on the ball : @entity0 opted for @entity96 ahead of @entity1 for tuesday night 's tie as reported in @entity117 this week , @entity0 has harboured concerns over @entity1 ’s fitness but will hope he can continue what has been a pretty good scoring run between now and the end of the season			1
‘ he does need a lot of football , ’ said @entity0 once again			1
‘ he ’s always been that type and it ’s always been the case			0
‘ there are a lot of things you can do when you lose a game			0
certainly we wo n’t give in , we will get off our backsides and be ready for sunday			0
’ across @entity138 , @entity137 weighed into the issue , saying he too could n’t see @entity1 leaving			1
‘ i think that @entity1 is one of the best strikers in @entity147 but i think it is difficult he can leave @entity2 , ’ said the @entity140 , whose side showed an interest in the @entity145 man two years ago			1
‘ it was always my opinion			0
like two years ago when there was a chance he would leave because i think he ’s an important player for @entity2			1
’ for @entity0 , focus now shifts to @entity37			1
‘ a big game is the best			0
we ’re at home and with a home draw in the @entity36 we ’ll play anyone			0
‘ @entity37 have a terrific cup record themselves , the best in the last decade , and we have n’t won it for nine years so there are a lot of incentives for us			0
@entity0 will face off against former @entity167 boss @entity166 on sunday ‘ @entity168 has n’t got a medal , for example , so that ’s another great incentive for us			1
’ it is hard to look back on tuesday ’s defeat without giving some consideration to the performance of @entity13 referee @entity12 , who sent off @entity2 winger @entity38 with @entity0 ’s team a goal up before the hour mark			1
certainly the @entity2 manager does not seem ready to forgive just yet			1
blow : @entity0 confirmed @entity181 was still not fit enough to return after an ankle injury ‘ on the issue of the referee , quite simply it ’s hard to keep your faith in the game , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s the third time we ’ve been knocked out by a referee ’s decision			1
‘ i was definitely concerned before the game			0
i said that to the staff but it ’s gone			2
there ’s nothing we can do about it			0
‘ it ’s not easy to take but , in the cold analysis of the day , you realise we ’re @entity2 and we just have to get on with it			1
nothing can be done now and the important issue is sunday			0
‘ it ’s clear in my mind now and we have to get on with it			0
it ’s another day in the history of our club			0
not a good day but another day			0
dismissed : @entity38 was shown a controversial red card in @entity2 's defeat by @entity7 one might think @entity2 fans would be calmed by their manager 's words on @entity1 on friday morning			1
however , a glance at the history books shows it ’s not the first time sir @entity0 has tried to flatten a story about one of the clubs stars after which the player is sent on his merry way anyway			1
after sensationally dropping @entity222 from a crucial @entity56 2nd leg against @entity7 , @entity0 went on to say : ' i saw it as quite a straightforward decision			1
@entity228 's form has been fantastic on the right hand side			0
there are only so many times you can hit a guy over the head			0
' when someone plays as well as he 's been playing , what do you do ? leave him out because @entity222 's a great player , too ? ’ that was on april 23			0
when asked if he would sell @entity222 , @entity0 responded : ' it is totally out of the question			1
there is no way we would sell him , or any of our best players			0
' @entity222 was sold that very july			0
watching brief : @entity222 was left out of @entity2 's @entity56 match with @entity7 in 2003 sound familiar ? it then happened again when the @entity245 left out @entity246 out of @entity2 ’s biggest game of the season , the 2006 @entity249			1
on dropping the @entity250 on february 26 , 2006 , @entity0 said : ' i think @entity252 [ @entity253 ] deserved to play			2
he had scored five goals in the previous games and , since he ’s been fit , i think he ’s scored 10 in 13 games			0
i think there ’s a danger you can sometimes overlook it and not give him the credit , but today he deserved to play in the final			0
' @entity246 seemed to be okay in the dressing room and okay with the players			0
he will be disappointed , you have to be disappointed			0
i have had that disappointment myself , being dropped in a cup final , at 10 past two , when you are the top goalscorer			0
' it happens and it ’s a horrible life that way			0
finals are terrible to pull players out and to only have five substitutes , i think it ’s wrong			0
' also pressed on whether the striker had a future with the club , @entity0 stated : ‘ of course , he ’s a member of our squad , no question			2
he ’s on a long contract and we ’re very happy with that situation			0
he has been patient and he ’s never complained			0
. three months late , in july of that year , @entity246 was sold			0
so @entity2 fans , if history tells us anything , then @entity1 may be facing the exit this summer after all , whatever sir @entity0 is trying to make you believe			1

sir @entity0 says @entity1 will remain at @entity2 next season
stands by decision to start @entity7 clash with @entity1 on the bench
@entity0 admits he had expressed concern to his staff about the appointment of referee @entity13 referee @entity12
