by @entity0 the foreboding message on the door reads : warning - reduced oxygen levels			0
inside , warm air gusts out at 90 degrees @entity14 ( 32 degrees @entity15 ) with 80 per cent humidity , as strength and conditioning coach @entity4 orders everyone to pedal harder and faster on their state - of - the - art @entity7 , used by @entity11 ’s cycling champions in their training			1
welcome to @entity19 ’s special @entity18 humidity chamber , their secret weapon in how to cope with the heat of the @entity23 jungle when they face @entity25 on saturday night			1
conditions : @entity19 's @entity27 mops the sweat from his head in the heat and humidity of @entity32 humidity : @entity33 's @entity0 ( right ) samples the @entity32 - like conditions in the chamber thanks to this tiny room inside @entity19 's national training centre at @entity41 , manager @entity37 is in charge of the best - prepared group of sportsmen ever to have left these islands			1
@entity46 , @entity47 and the rest of the 23 - man squad were virtually encamped in there for four days up to the start of last week to undergo the physical preparation that could make the difference between glory and disaster in @entity56			1
there is just enough room to fit six bikes , a generator and the gadgets needed to set the temperature and humidity levels to replicate exactly what they can expect in their first game of the @entity18			2
‘ by the time the @entity19 boys had finished working , the glass was totally steamed up and people outside could n’t see in through the window , ’ said an impressed @entity4			2
‘ i think this chamber has been a massive help in preparing for the @entity18			0
the more you can be exposed to the environment that you are going to compete at , the better			0
’ ready : the @entity19 squad train in @entity32 ahead of their @entity18 opener with @entity25 this evening pondering : @entity19 manager @entity37 ( right ) looks on as @entity78 prepares for the match medical specialist @entity80 , who runs a @entity82 medical centre of excellence , concurs : ' @entity19 have trained in five locations across four countries for the @entity18			1
but it 's only the bike sessions in the 35 degree ( @entity15 ) chambers that will have given the players the body shock of a wall of heat			1
' to try and illustrate the benefits , @entity4 this week put a middle - aged and unfit hack - me - through my paces at the humidity chamber this week , accompanied by a proper former professional footballer , former @entity100 and @entity102 footballer @entity101			1
able to regulate conditions inside the chamber , @entity4 ordered us onto the bikes and to start pedaling at 70 % per cent humidity – sweaty indeed , but still below the 80 per cent that @entity19 can expect in @entity32 when the game kicks off at 6pm local time			1
after 95 seconds , the first bead of sweat appeared on my face			0
after three minutes , my heart rate was noticeably higher and there was a first overwhelming urge to swig at the cool bottle of water i was allowed as a non-athlete to take in for safety reasons			0
as breathing became a heavier , an unsympathetic @entity4 only increased the temperature and humidity , perhaps remembering the local saying in @entity32 : ' we ’ve got two seasons here – summer and @entity125 '			1
sweltering : the @entity127 opener between @entity19 and @entity25 takes place at the @entity129 hydrated : @entity19 's @entity130 takes on fluids during training in @entity32 ahead of the @entity25 match the effect was like running in a sauna			1
i was glad @entity101 was sweating even more than me , though to be fair he was peddling a lot harder too			0
the hard work that @entity37 's men put in before crossing the @entity142 will pay off according to @entity4 , whose company perform is based permanently at @entity41			0
‘ i think it ’s safe to say this is the best - prepared @entity19 team ever to go to a tournament because sports science in itself has developed massively even over the last four years , ' he said			1
‘ no stone has been left unturned so the lads are in the best possible condition			0
we ’ve studied conditions in @entity32 because with any sport you need to spend time understanding the physical demands so you can set training parameters - physiological , duration , intensity and environment			1
' and obviously in @entity32 , environment is going to be key			2
‘ normally it takes seven to 10 days to acclimatise to any sort of environmental changes so the work they have done here is certainly going to benefit the team and the medical staff			0
’ afterwards , a profusely - sweating @entity101 had some encouraging news for @entity19 fans as he clambered off the bike : ' that was tough - i was n't one of the best at @entity100 at fitness and aerobic tests , but @entity46 was very good			1
maestro : @entity19 will have to deal with the class of @entity180 ( centre ) in the sweltering conditions hot and bothered : @entity25 's @entity183 wipes his wet forehead during training in @entity32 ' @entity186 was probably the best , some of the foreign lads , but @entity46 was fine			1
he was a fit lad			0
' the level of detail in @entity19 ’s planning before they left @entity41 for their final warm - up games in @entity193 is astonishing			2
every individual player has been tested and given their own sweat profile			0
it helps determine how much liquid , and exactly what kind , each of them will be given during the @entity25 game			2
@entity4 explains : ‘ everyone has a separate sweat profile and different electrolyte balance			0
whilst it is important to balance the water intake to the amount of water you ’re losing through sweating , the most important thing is the electrolytes that we lose as part of that sweat			0
‘ we need vital things like sodium chloride , potassium , magnesium , they all play a part in how the nerves @entity225 a cognitive point of view , a mental point of view , once those stores diminish , it can massively effect your performance			0
’ the general advice for players is to refuel little and often , around 200mls every 20 minutes			2
too much in one go and you ’ll get cramps			0
up to speed : @entity19 's players are prepared for the conditions after using the humidity chamber fitness : @entity19 are taken on a warm up session in @entity32 as they familiarise themselves with conditions @entity82 will allow three - minute water breaks once temperatures go above 36 degrees but different players will get different drinks , depending on how well they retain sodium chloride and other electrolytes in the body			1
the @entity7 has the facility to determine how strong the right side of each player ’s body is compared to the left and what needs extra work			0
near to the chamber and other cardiovascular gym equipment , a £ 250,000 underwater treadmill at @entity41 ’s gave extra help to any players who ended the season with particular aches and pains			2
mercifully , @entity4 allowed me to stop pedalling after 20 energy - sapping minutes in the humidity chamber			1
one trusts the @entity19 players managed a longer spell than that if they ’re expected to chase @entity180 for 90 minutes on saturday .			2

@entity19 used the humidity chamber to replicate conditions of @entity32
the chamber has state - of - the - art @entity273 , used by @entity11 's cyclists
their @entity278 opener against @entity25 kicks off tonight
described by medical specialists as replicating the ' wall of heat ' in @entity56
players are advised to refuel 200ml every *20minutes* in heat and humidity
