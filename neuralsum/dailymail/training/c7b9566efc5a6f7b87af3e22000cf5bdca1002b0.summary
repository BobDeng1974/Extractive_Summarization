they are @entity1 ’s most sought - after schools , where parents would be delighted for their children to have a place			1
but few parents would themselves make the grade in the exam that pupils must pass to be admitted to a grammar or public school			2
just 12 per cent of parents – about one in eight – who attempted a test modelled on the @entity16 scored more than 80 per cent – the approximate pass mark			1
only 12 per cent of parents - about one in eight - passed a test modelled on the 11 - plus after scoring more than 80 per cent - the approximate pass mark ( file picture ) some scored as low as one out of 20 in the test , devised by @entity24			1
education experts say while a mark of about 80 per cent would typically gain admission to the top schools , in some areas where selective establishments see 12 or more pupils apply for each place , pupils may need to achieve closer to 100 per cent			1
a survey among the parents – a representative sample from a range of backgrounds – also found overwhelming support for grammar schools , with 72 per cent saying they supported their existence in the @entity1			1
in total , 500 parents were asked to complete a briefer set of challenging @entity16 - style questions taken from the popular @entity49 books , the study guides many of their children use to hone their exam skills			1
parent @entity51 , of @entity52 , scored five out of 20 on the @entity54 test			0
the 53 - year - old , a mature student at the @entity56 studying health and social sciences , said : ‘ i expected to do better but i found the questions a little confusing			0
‘ it was quite difficult			0
it is a long time since i did an exam			0
’ another , who preferred not to be named , scored just three out of ten in the verbal reasoning paper			0
he said : ‘ it was a bit embarrassing			0
i have n’t come across that type of question before			0
’ overall , two per cent got full marks on the test , while five per cent scored above 90 per cent			2
just 12 per cent got more than 80 per cent correct and almost a quarter – 24 per cent – got 75 per cent of the questions right			2
@entity73 , chairman of the @entity74 , said pupils taking the @entity16 in the @entity1 would normally need to achieve a pass mark of between 75 per cent and 90 per cent			1
but he said that while some regions such as @entity79 , where nearly a quarter of pupils win grammar places , were still well provided with academically selective state schools , the required pass rate shoots up in areas such as parts of @entity86 , where a few schools are so oversubscribed that most of their successful applicants score 100 per cent			2
he added : ‘ adults , however , are unlikely to do as well as their children in such tests , because they are not familiar with them or so practised in taking such tests			0
’ he added that large swathes of the country have no grammar schools , and the results of our survey showing they remained very popular – despite the decision of successive governments not to reintroduce academic selection in secondary schools – shows politicians need to rethink the issue			1
overall last year , 30,000 pupils in @entity54 took the @entity16 for places in just 164 grammar schools			1
there is also huge pressure on places at independent selective schools that use similar entrance tests – especially day schools in the @entity115			0
though comprehensive state schools are no longer allowed to select by academic ability , a number do use such tests for a proportion of their applicants , either because they have retained historic rights to do so or because they promote an area of excellence such as languages			0
in our experiment , carried out by polling company @entity128 , the 500 parents were split into four groups , each answering 10 - minute @entity54 , maths , verbal reasoning or non-verbal reasoning papers , the last two of which are widely used @entity138 - style tests			2
the maths test proved the easiest , with 11 per cent scoring more than 90 per cent , while the @entity54 test was the hardest , with nobody achieving above 90 per cent			2
mr @entity73 said this reflected the fact that adults tended to retain their mathematical ability better than other skills			0
a spokesman for @entity149 books said : ‘ @entity149 not only provides the relevant content and skills resources that grammar schools are looking for , but also the exam techniques and question styles associated with the 11 - plus test to best help your child to succeed			1

only 12 per cent of parents - about one in eight - passed challenging test modelled on the 11 - plus examination
experts warn several pupils need to achieve between 75 per cent and 90 per cent for entry to grammar schools
survey taken by 500 parents from different backgrounds found overwhelming support for grammar schools in @entity1
