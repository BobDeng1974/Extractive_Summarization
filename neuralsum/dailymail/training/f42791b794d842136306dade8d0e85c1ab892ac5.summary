a mysterious ocean ' blob ' has been recorded by a deep - sea remote - controlled underwater camera			0
the creature looks like nothing seen before , with speculators suggesting it is everything from a jellyfish to the remains of a whale placenta			1
while , at a quick glance , the description of a jellyfish makes sense , the creature has organs and appendages never spotted on a jellyfish before			2
meanwhile it could be a whale placenta , but if that is the case then the hexagonal shapes on the skin are a mystery			1
identified : the mysterious creature has been revealed to be a deep sea jellyfish objects within : the creature is a rarely studied jelly fish known as @entity28 unusual : the hexagonal markings on the creature implied the creature was not a jellyfish solved : the blob is a @entity28 - a jelly fish which grows to approximately 60cm in width if it is a jellyfish , it might be a @entity35			1
this type of jellyfish - which can grow up to six metres in length - has only been spotted 114 times in 110 years , so details on it are scant			2
but again , the appendages get in the way			0
another suggestion is @entity28 , another rarely - studied jellyfish , which like most of its kind is colourless			0
however it has reported to have a brown stomach , with one description saying the passages to the stomach are ' somewhat irregular - edged , forming a reticulate network '			0
this might explain the hexagonal markings on the top of the creature - but again , what are the organs doing there ? those markings lead one commentator on the website @entity64 - which tries to debunk or confirm rumours - to suggest this is simply nothing more than a fishing net			1
but again , the appendages get in the way			0
another mystery - a man - made one , this time - is exactly where this video was filmed			0
it was added to @entity75 on april 27 this year , and appears to have been filmed two days earlier , but the poster did not leave any other details about the sighting			2
bizarre : the creature had many bizarre appendages which have now been explained as testicles wrong : @entity75 commentators suggested it may be a whale placenta other strange organs kept viewers scratching their heads but the mystery has now been solved			1

@entity75 video leaves commentators baffled
creature could be a jellyfish - but it appears to have organs
it could be a *discarded* whale placenta - but it has strange markings
it could be a fishing net - but it seems to move under its own control
