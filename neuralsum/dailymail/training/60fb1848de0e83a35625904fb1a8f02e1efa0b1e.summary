by @entity0 @entity1 has blamed jet lag for the @entity4 gaffe that saw the @entity7 co-chairman ' favourite ' a post criticising his club 's already under fire manager @entity10			1
@entity10 ’s future appeared to be on even thinner ice than it already was after a nightmare pre-season tour of @entity14 ended with losses to @entity16 and @entity17 when @entity18 appeared to endorse a derogatory message about the manager on the social media site			1
gold has now said he inadvertently ' favourited ' the tweet but in a series of three tweets clarifying his position he stopped short of an apology to @entity10			0
backtrack : @entity7 co-chairman @entity1 blamed jet lag after he favourited a tweet calling for the axing of club manager @entity10 not intentional : @entity1 favourited the tweet from ' stephen ' about sacking @entity10 ' after a 33 hour flight from @entity14 , i was in my car scanning through my tweets and it seems i accidently favourited one , ' @entity18 posted on tuesday			1
' it has made some of the papers today ( tuesday ) so i should clarify that i did not and would never deliberately or intentionally endorse a tweet that questions our manager 's position			2
lesson : do n't use twitter when you 're jet lagged ! ' @entity10 has been made aware of the fact that @entity1 , who has 92,000 followers on @entity4 , was sent a message by a @entity7 fan that read : ‘ is today the day we get rid of @entity51 ? ? fingers crossed			0
’ ' bfs ' is a derogatory reference to @entity10 and @entity18 ’s decision to ‘ favourite ’ the message has only intensified the speculation that @entity10 ’s time at @entity58 may not last to the start of the season			2
facing the sack : @entity10 might not even make the first game of the season divisive : @entity10 wants to move @entity63 on but co-chairman @entity64 wants to offer him a contract @entity10 , who was warned at the end of last season that the owner ’s wanted an improved style of football , has recently clashed with @entity18 and the other co-chairman @entity64 over midfielder @entity63 who has become a peripheral figure under @entity10 but who @entity64 wants to offer a new contract			1
@entity1 's daughter @entity75 added further intrigue to events at @entity7 by tweeting : ' great to see @ davidgold back home after trip to @entity81 with the team & especially looking forward to the football news at dinner tomorrow night			0
' @entity64 has also insisted that the record signing of @entity86 was a huge mistake			0
the striker will miss at least three months of the season with an ankle injury and @entity64 revealed that he regretted ‘ putting all his eggs in one basket ’ by signing the @entity95 international			0
@entity64 also seemed to make @entity10 's position more awkward last week when he revealed the board and the boss were at odds over the future of @entity63 - with the owners wanting to tie the @entity102 international down on a longer contract despite @entity10 suggesting he does not have a future in his side			1
@entity1 's daughter @entity75 hinted that there might be some news in the pipeline unhappy : @entity7 co-owner @entity64 has clashed with the manager over @entity63 @entity7 appear to be closing in on the signing of @entity113 full - back @entity112			0

@entity18 said he did n't mean to favourite the tweet after getting off a flight
co-chairman said he would never intentionally endorse a tweet questioning @entity10 's position
he does n't however apologise to his club 's under fire manager
@entity10 is under *pressure* after losing both games on tour of @entity14
the manager recently clashed with board over future of @entity63
club *reeling* from news @entity86 to miss first three months of season
