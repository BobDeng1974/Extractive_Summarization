water fluoridation above a certain level is linked to 30 per cent higher than expected rates of an underactive thyroid			1
the gland is found in the neck weight gain and depression caused by an underactive thyroid is linked to high levels of fluoride in the water supply , scientists have claimed			1
a study published today has revealed water fluoridation above a certain level is linked to 30 per cent higher than expected rates of hypothyroidism in @entity18			1
the findings have prompted researchers to call for a revision of public health policy , which currently encourages the fluoridation of water to protect the nation 's tooth health			1
fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral found in water , and certain foods including tea and fish			0
its main benefit is in helping reduce the risk of tooth decay			0
as a result the mineral is added to many brands of toothpaste , and in some areas , to the water supply			0
but researchers at the @entity42 have warned the mineral may be responsible for triggering underactive thyroids			0
other experts have however , disagreed with their findings , arguing the research methods were flawed			0
@entity18 also dismissed the study , adding ' decades of research tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure , and shows no association with reduced thyroid function '			1
also known as hypothyroidism , the condition prevents the thyroid - a gland in the neck - producing vital hormones			1
that in turn , promotes weight gain , causes depression and tiredness in sufferers			1
the authors , led by professor @entity66 , at the university 's @entity67 , conclude : ' consideration needs to be given to reducing fluoride exposure , and public dental health interventions should stop [ those ] reliant on ingested fluoride and switch to topical fluoride - based and non-fluoride - based interventions			2
' in @entity18 , around 10 per cent of the population - amounting to six million people - live in areas with a naturally or artificially fluoridated water supply of 1mg fluoride per litre of drinking water			2
the scientists examined the 2012 levels of fluoride in the drinking water supply , using data provided by the @entity86 for individual postcodes			2
they looked at these fluoride levels in conjunction with the national prevalence of underactive thyroid , diagnosed by @entity92 at 7,935 of 8,020 surgeries that were eligible for the study in 2012 - 13			2
the researchers also carried out a secondary analysis , comparing two built - up areas			0
the @entity98 , an area supplied with fluoridated drinking water , was pitched against @entity100 , which was not			0
the areas in blue show gp practices where water fluoridation is below 0.3mg per litre , yellow equates to 0.3 to 0.7mg per litre of water , while red shows areas where levels are greater than 0.7mg per litre			1
the areas highlighted in green are where health authority fluoridation schemes are in place after noting influential factors , such as female sex and older age - both of which are linked to greater risks of hypothyroidism - the team found a link between rates of the condition and levels of fluoride in the drinking water			1
where fluoride levels were above 0.7mg per litre , they found higher than expected rates of hypothyroidism than in areas with levels below this dilution			2
high rates of hypothyroidism were at least 30 per cent more likely in gp practices located in areas with fluoride levels in excess of 0.3mg per litre			2
and practices in the @entity98 were nearly twice as likely to report high rates of hypothyroidism as those in @entity100			0
the authors note theirs is an observational study , so no definitive conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect			0
they said they were not able to take into account other potential sources of fluoride , including that found in dental products and food and drink			0
but they said their research echoes past studies			0
while they were only able to look at diagnosed hypothyroidism , there might also be other cases of impaired thyroid function that have not yet been diagnosed , and treated			1
however professor @entity158 , professor of @entity159 at the @entity160 , dismissed the study 's findings , criticising the researchers ' methods			2
he said : ' as epidemiological evidence goes , this is about as weak as it gets			0
the scientists argue public health policy , which currently encourages the fluoridation of water to protect the nation 's tooth health , should be revised in light of their research ' essentially the researchers have shown that after limited adjustment for demographic differences , there are somewhat higher rates of hypothyroidism - which can result from a number of different diseases - in four areas of @entity18 that have higher concentrations of fluoride in drinking water			1
' it is quite possible that the observed association is a consequence of other ways in which the areas with higher fluoride differ from the rest of the country			0
' there are substantially more rigorous epidemiological methods by which the research team could have tested their idea			0
' meanwhile dr @entity199 , director of @entity200 at @entity18 , said the body ' regularly reviews the evidence base for water fluoridation '			1
she said : ' the totality of evidence , accumulated over decades of research , tells us that water fluoridation is a safe and effective public health measure , and shows no association with reduced thyroid function			1
' @entity18 's own assessment of water fluoridation programmes in @entity18 found evidence of lower tooth decay rates in children living in fluoridated compared to non-fluoridated areas , and greater reductions among those living in the most deprived areas			1
' the study is published online in the @entity221 .			0

study found high levels of fluoride in water is linked to hypothyroidism
condition is where thyroid gland fails to produce key hormones
a sufferer is therefore likely to gain weight , suffer depression and tiredness
scientists urge change in public health policy , which promotes water fluoridation to boost the nation 's tooth health
@entity18 dismissed findings and said ' decades of research *...* shows no association with reduced thyroid function ' and fluoride
