by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 4 december 2013 women spend almost twice as much as their men on their sexy @entity4 lingerie , according to a new survey			1
in the hope of becoming a sexy mrs @entity8 this year , ladies will spend £ 47 on new lingerie over the festive season			1
however , if men are in charge of buying the gifts , they spend almost half as much - just £ 24			1
nervous : men spend half as much as their partner on sexy @entity4 lingerie because they are terrified their lover will hate their choice but the difference in spending is n't because men are skinflints - they are worried of completely misjudging their lover 's tastes so they tend to opt for the first sexy slip that they see and leave it at that			2
women are more confident about their purchases and happily splash out on three times as many pieces as their men			0

' the fact they buy three times as much as men is great for both parties - she feels fabulously sexy and confident in lingerie that suits her perfectly and he gets to enjoy the new view			0
' men tend to impulse buy when it comes to underwear and go for the first sexy slip they see			0
they 're probably unsure if their partner will like their choice so they prefer to spend less			0
