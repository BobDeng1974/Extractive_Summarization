anti-gm campaigners reacted with fury last night after the government backed an @entity4 vote that could lead to weedkiller - resistant maize being sowed in @entity6 next year			1
other @entity8 countries can ban the so - called @entity9 after @entity4 ministers said members could opt out of @entity13 planting			2
critics said @entity6 ’s first commercial @entity13 crops would spell disaster for wildlife and contaminate conventional and organic crops , with ‘ catastrophic ’ consequences for farmers			1
the @entity2 position is also at odds with those of the @entity24 and the @entity25 , which have opted for a ban			0
controversial : the government has backed an @entity4 vote which could see weedkiller - resistant maize being sowed in @entity6 next year			1
critics say it could spell disaster for wildlife and other crops the @entity4 vote allowing the planting of two types of maize resistant to the weedkiller roundup was passed by agriculture ministers in @entity38 , although the @entity39 must approve it			1
dr @entity40 , of the campaign group @entity41 , said : ‘ the government has colluded with commercial lobbyists to fast track @entity13 maize into @entity6 , despite the expected harm to @entity48 wildlife such as birds and butterflies caused by blanket spraying of these crops			1
‘ if some farmers in @entity6 press ahead with @entity13 cultivation , conventional and organic farmers across the country will face the unnecessary risk of loss of markets due to contamination with @entity13 ’ the government ’s @entity63 stance also flies in the face of public opinion , with most consumers saying they are concerned about the impact of the crops on the countryside , wildlife and their health			1
the approval of commercial @entity13 planting has been stalled for ten years because the @entity4 needed all member states to vote for it			2
@entity77 has been pressing for regulations that allow individual member states to plant @entity13 crops once @entity81 has approved them environment secretary @entity77 – the government ’s cheerleader for genetically - modified crops – has been pressing for regulations that allow individual member states to plant them once they have been declared safe by @entity81			2
he said the @entity4 decision will fast - track them into farms and supermarkets , adding : ‘ this is a real step forward in unblocking the dysfunctional @entity4 process for approving @entity13 crops , which is letting down farmers and stopping scientific development			1
‘ farmers will have more power in deciding whether to grow @entity13 crops that have passed a robust , independent safety assessment			0
’ but @entity94 , of organic industry body the @entity96 , said : ‘ in future , a committed , @entity63 secretary of state like @entity77 could take the decision to make @entity6 a “ @entity13 country ” , and once that is taken it will be difficult for a future government to adopt a different position			2
this will lead to farmers losing export markets to the rest of @entity8 and most of the rest of the world , which would be catastrophic			0
’ the @entity4 vote is a victory for multi-national biotech firms , which have spent millions lobbying @entity48 ministers and officials to speed up the approval of @entity13 crops			1
the government claims there is no risk to humans or the environment			0
but @entity8 and @entity120 research suggests there are health concerns and a threat to wildlife , and warns of the damage from ‘ superweeds ’ that develop a natural resistance to the pesticides used on @entity13 crops			0
@entity129 , director of @entity130 , said : ‘ even if a country or region does establish a ban , they will find it very difficult to protect their fields and food from contamination if neighbours start growing @entity13 ’ however , the @entity2 said safeguards would be put in place to protect conventional crops from @entity13 contamination			0
the vote by @entity4 ministers is the culmination of a campaign by the biotech industry and the government to fast - track the approval of @entity13 crops			1
the collaboration began with a @entity152 summit in summer 2012 , attended by agriculture ministers and science minister @entity154			0
organised by the @entity156 , which is funded and run by @entity13 firms , it agreed that the @entity158 would lobby the @entity4 to allow the planting of biotech crops in @entity48 , even if they were banned in other member states			2
agriculture secretary @entity77 and fellow ministers spent months persuading their @entity4 counterparts to agree			0
they were aided by an ‘ independent ’ review of @entity13 by @entity48 scientists , suggesting the crops could prevent @entity170 starvation and create plants resistant to disease and pests			0
. but the @entity174 found that its five authors were @entity13 supporters , and one was a consultant for biotech firm @entity177 .			0

@entity4 vote could see weedkiller - resistent maize sown in @entity6 next year
critics say @entity184 produce would spell disaster for wildlife and other crops
government decision to back vote at odds with @entity192 and @entity193
