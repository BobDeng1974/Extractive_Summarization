by @entity0 published : 14:41 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 31 may 2013 scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of how the skeletons of more than 200 people came to be in a frozen lake in @entity6 the skeletons , which were first discovered by a @entity9 forest guard in 1942 , were initially thought to be the bodies of @entity12 soldiers travelling through @entity13 as part of a @entity16 land invasion			1
but although the cold climate around the @entity19 , at 16,000ft above sea level , had preserved some of the hair , flesh and leather clothes of the victims , the bodies were dated to around @entity26			1
they concluded that the family were likely to be pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals as guides			0
theories ranging from a landslide to a mass suicide were put forward to explain the deaths , but it is only now that researchers believe they know what caused the cracks in their skulls			0
during @entity16 the @entity9 government feared they were the remains of @entity12 soldiers , but tested showed they were much older now scientists believe a sudden freak hailstorm is to blame for the cracked skulls of the dead the skeletons remain littered around the lake 's edge the @entity19 of @entity64 is in northern @entity13 near @entity65 a 2004 expedition to the site concluded the group was killed by cricket ball - sized hailstones during a sudden storm			1
this , they decided , was the only way to explain why the skulls and shoulder bones of the dead had all been hit by rounded objects directly from above			0
as there was nowhere to shelter in the valley , the group was at the mercy of the storm			2
their bodies lay in the lake , which regularly freezes , for the next 1,200 years until their wartime discovery			2
