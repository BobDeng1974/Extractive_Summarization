by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 03:45 est , 8 august 2013 sir @entity1 claims to have recently spotted a big cat roaming around his grounds when eccentric aristocrat sir @entity1 picked up one of his many guns last month and strode out onto his estate , he claimed he was trying to protect the public from a mysterious big cat stalking his lands			1
but it seems not everyone wanted his protection			0
a member of the public complained to the police that they felt threatened after pictures of gun - toting sir @entity1 , 67 , were published in the @entity19 and other newspapers			1
the call resulted in a visit from armed police demanding to inspect his collection of 150 ﬁrearms			2
the baronet had to intercept the ofﬁcers at the gates of @entity30 , near @entity31 , @entity32 , as he had hired the venue out for a wedding and feared the guests would be upset			0
sir @entity1 , who made his fortune as a shipping magnate , said that it was the fourth time his guns had been investigated and that he had contacted his mp to complain about the police response			1
he previously made headlines last year when police staged a dramatic raid on his home , which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured			1
on that occasion he said he had used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window			0
sir @entity1 posed for the latest pictures after numerous sightings of what he claimed was a large puma stalking his grounds			1
a staff member even managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone			2
sir @entity1 , who named the cat @entity65 of @entity66 after the village nearest his estate , told the @entity19 last month : ‘ i think it is bigger than most cats , probably bigger than a puma			1
‘ when i saw the photo , it was visibly huge			0
the grass in the picture is two - and - a - half foot high			2
‘ we need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog			0
a member of the public complained to the police that they felt threatened after pictures of gun - toting sir @entity1 were published in the @entity19 ‘ @entity87 , i need the head to put in my collection			1
’ a few days after the story was published @entity90 telephoned sir @entity1 to say they had received a complaint			1
they arranged to inspect his weapons on wednesday last week			0
mysterious : what appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by sir @entity1 at @entity30 , @entity32 he told them he had a wedding booked that day but they would not reschedule - and he had no choice but to warn the couple that their happy day could be interrupted by a raid			1
the ofﬁcers checked the gun from the photograph and were satisﬁed that it was deactivated , but sir @entity1 had to persuade them not to do a full inspection of his 150 weapons , which include 400 - year - old muskets , a tommy gun , blunderbusses , a 12 - bore @entity114 shotgun and an @entity116 assault riﬂe			1
the baronet , whose family have lived in @entity30 since 1772 and are descended from royalty , told the @entity120 : ‘ we tried to keep the police out the way			2
you ’ve got to really , it makes people nervous , they might stop drinking			0
‘ they [ the police ] wanted to check every gun in the bar and the house … there are guns on the wall everywhere			1
' they would have been all crawling around the bar and the house , pulling things off the wall , which is not very helpful			0
’ sir @entity1 said his weapons were all deactivated and had been inspected by police two years ago			1
the previous raid , last may , saw 18 armed ofﬁcers swarm the property in a raid that included roadblocks and a surveillance helicopter			0
all his licensed guns were conﬁscated and so what remains of his collection is deactivated			0
deactivated weapons do not require a licence and are not covered by any legislation			0

’ @entity174 and @entity32 police last night confirmed that they had visited @entity30			2
supt @entity175 said : ‘ we received a call from a member of the public who was concerned about a ﬁrearm			2
we attended a property to carry out a check but are satisﬁed that the weapon is decommissioned			0
