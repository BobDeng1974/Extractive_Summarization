by @entity0 published : 13:53 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 04:04 est , 13 january 2014 the ceo of the company at the center of a chemical leak in @entity6 that has left more than 300,000 people without drinking water for four days is facing mounting criticism following his arrogant display before the television cameras on friday night			1
@entity13 president @entity12 sounded rude and aloof as he attempted to cut short his press conference in @entity15 after complaining to reporters that he had had a long day			1
to make matters worse @entity18 repeatedly swigged from a water of bottle , seemingly impervious to the fact that his company had disrupted water services in nine counties , depriving 300,000 people of tap water to drink or even wash themselves			1
‘ look guys , it ’s been an extremely long day			1
i ’m having a lot of trouble talking at the moment			0
i ’d appreciate it if we could wrap this thing up , ’ he complained			0
but before @entity18 could walk away , he was quickly interrupted by local news anchor / reporter @entity52 from @entity54			1
‘ we actually have a lot of questions , ’ said the persistent reporter			2
‘ it ’s been a long day for a lot of people who do n’t have water			1
’ local news anchor / reporter @entity52 from @entity54 has won plaudits for her dogged interview style when her line of questioning started to get a little awkward for @entity18 , he made another ill - judged attempt to wrap things up by saying ‘ that ’s all we have time for			1
’ once again @entity52 was quick to stop @entity18 in his tracks			1
' we 're not done ! ' she shouted as @entity18 turned his back on the cameras			1
the look he gives her as he realizes that he is going to have to take another question is priceless			0
cart has received praise for her handling of the water crisis and for her dogged interview style on both @entity85 and @entity86 , while @entity18 's ill - judged lack of compassion has been compared to @entity89 , the disgraced former boss of @entity90			1
in the wake of @entity18 's disastrous tv appearance , @entity13 ' local public relations firm @entity93 announced on sunday that it has decided it will no longer represent the chemicals company , reports @entity54			1
video : watch @entity12 's disastrous press conference if looks could kill : @entity18 quickly grew terse when it came time for questions and he shot @entity52 an extremely dirty look when she called him back after he attempted to end their interview it could be days before uncontaminated water is flowing again for about 300,000 people in nine @entity6 counties			1
@entity105 found bottled water on saturday for his two elderly next - door neighbors			2
‘ they ca n't get out , ’ said @entity105 , 42 , of @entity108 , a coal miner			2
' i 'm keeping an eye on them			0
you got to watch out for your neighbors			0
they 're the ones who are going to watch out for you			0
' he said he was angry at the company at the center of the leak , @entity13			1
' a lot of people are facing bad situations because of this , ' he said			2
what i do n't understand is how did this happen ? ' the emergency began on thursday following complaints to @entity132 about a licorice - type odor in the tap water			1
the source : the chemical 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , which had leaked out of a 40,000 - gallon tank at a @entity13 facility along the @entity139			1
state officials said on saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked			0
some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river ; it 's not clear exactly how much entered the water supply			1
it could take days for clean tap water to flow again			1
first , water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical 's presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts per million , the level recommended by federal agencies , @entity132 president @entity147 said on saturday at a news conference			1
southern , right , made an ill - judged attempt to wrap things up by saying ' that 's all we have time for ' and turning his back on the cameras while being questioned by @entity163 , left most visitors have cleared out of @entity15 while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere			2
orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses			1
' i have n't been able to cook anything at home and was hoping they were open , ' @entity177 , 52 , said outside a closed @entity182 in @entity108 , just east of @entity15			2
' it seems like every place is closed			0
' there 's no question businesses have been hurt - particularly restaurants and hotels , said @entity191 , president of the @entity192 , the state 's largest regional chamber of commerce			0
' i do n't know that it can be quantified at this point because we do n't know how long it will last , ' @entity191 said			2
' i 'm hoping a solution by early next week so business can get back to normal			0
' the @entity192 is urging business owners to check their insurance policies to see if they can make claims over lost sales			0
it plans to hold workshops to assist businesses with those issues , @entity191 said			0
@entity209 need : employees of the @entity211 help local residents to obtain water as officials remained mum as to win the tap water would become safe again @entity217 told , 32 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea			1
of those , four were admitted to the @entity224 but their conditions were n't immediately available			0
federal authorities , including the @entity227 , opened an investigation into thursday 's spill			0
@entity231 officials said they need a 24 - hour period in which samples at the water treatment facility are below 1 part per million			0
many samples are meeting the mark , but some are still hitting slightly above 1 part per million			0
after they achieve that goal , @entity240 can begin sampling across the nine - county region and flushing the system			2
that process would take days , said company president @entity147			1
according to @entity249 officials , @entity13 is exempt from @entity249 inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals , and does n't produce them			1
gov. @entity253 said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session			2
local businesses remain closed and unable to serve food and water in @entity15 , @entity6 on sunday after a chemical spill on thursday in the @entity139 in downtown , the store @entity263 usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe			1
but the cafe was shut down by the state @entity268 on friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers			2
on saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless internet			0
manager @entity277 said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early			0
' it 's pretty annoying , ' @entity277 said about @entity13 ' response to the spill			2
' i feel like you should just be honest with people immediately			0
' at @entity15 's @entity287 , seven inbound and outbound flights were canceled			0
the reason for the cancellations was an agreement between the airlines and unions for flight crews and pilots that hotels meet a certain threshold of service , and the lack of water violates the agreement , said airport spokesman @entity301			0
state officials were working over the weekend on alternative sources of water that may allow restaurants to reopen			0
several businesses that had arranged other sources of water were inspected saturday			0
' we will work around the clock , 24 - 7 , and try to open ... as many businesses as possible in the next couple of days , ' said dr. @entity313 , health officer for the @entity15 and @entity315 boards of health .			0

more than 300,000 people have n't had water to drink or wash in @entity6 since thursday
chemical company @entity13 are to blame for the spillage which has polluted the local water supply
@entity240 president @entity12 appeared before cameras on friday evening to apologize but he failed to *convince*
he tried to cut short his press conference by complaining to reporters that he had had a long day
he *foolishly* drank from a bottle of water throughout the interview , despite the fact that his company was preventing others from that very *luxury*
when he turned his back to finish the interview , local reporter @entity52 demanded he come back because they were n't finished
@entity341 and their local pr agency parted ways on sunday following the media relations disaster for the chemical company
it could be days before the residents of nine counties in @entity350 can drink or wash in the tap water again
