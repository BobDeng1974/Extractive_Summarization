@entity0 are 80 minutes away from another @entity1 after justifying their tag of firm title favourites in a hopelessly one - sided play - off tie against @entity5			1
the reigning @entity7 champions were utterly dominant against a @entity9 side sorely missing their inspirational captain @entity10 as they ran in 10 tries in a 57 - 4 victory , their biggest ever play - off win			0
@entity15 winger @entity14 scored two of the tries and second rower @entity19 scored his first for the club since returning from rugby union , much to the delight of younger brother @entity23 - back at the end of the @entity26 season - watching from the corporate boxes			2
@entity28 ( centre ) is congratulated on his try by @entity14 and @entity31 @entity28 celebrates his try @entity33 dives over for @entity0 's fifth try of a devastating display the @entity37 ' reward is a week off and a home tie in the semi-finals while @entity5 must quickly regroup ahead of their sudden - death tie next week after suffering a 10th defeat in 13 play - off ties			1
the @entity9 had won on seven of their 10 previous visits to the @entity44 and ended the regular season with a seven - match unbeaten run but they were simply outclassed by a @entity0 side marshalled superbly by half - backs @entity50 and @entity51 , who finished with 21 points from a try , eight goals and a drop goal			1
the warning bells were ringing for the visitors as early as the third minute when teenager winger @entity28 , who revelled in his partnership with @entity31 , collected @entity50 's high kick only for his centre to lose the ball attempting to ground it over the line			0
the @entity37 ' decision to open the scoring with a @entity51 penalty suggested a tight contest and it was the visitors who went closest to scoring the first try on their first foray into their opponents ' 20 - metre area , with centre @entity75 halted by a thunderous tackle by full - back @entity78 and acting captain @entity80 losing the ball over the line			2
@entity83 ( second right ) is delighted with his try @entity19 roars with delight after crossing the line two - try hero @entity14 was all smiles after @entity0 's crushing win forced to defend throughout the opening quarter , @entity5 were hanging on grimly until full - back @entity89 conceded a scrum 10 metres out and that helped @entity0 lay their victory platform with four tries in a devastating 13 - minute spell			1
@entity78 's brilliant cut - out pass got @entity14 over for his 22nd try in 19 appearances in 2014 and then @entity51 took centre stage			0
first the former @entity101 and @entity102 scrum - half burst through the attempted tackle of @entity103 and sidestepped @entity104 for a solo score and then put substitute forward @entity106 through a gap for a try			0
@entity0 were simply irresistible at that stage and they topped an impressive first half with a long - range try , fashioned by the left - wing pairing of @entity31 and @entity28 and finished by second rower @entity113			2
@entity28 dives over the whitewash @entity51 , who scored 21 points , gets ready to overload as he 's pursued by the @entity9 ' @entity117 with @entity51 converting three of the tries , the defending champions were out of sight by half - time , when they led 24 - 0 , but the @entity9 gave themselves brief hope by scoring the first try of the second half			1
@entity103 's darting run opened up the @entity0 defence and @entity129 's kick was palmed back into his grateful arms by @entity131 for the @entity15 centre to touch down for what proved to be mere consolation as the visitors were hit by four more tries in a 12 - minute spell			0
@entity51 's half - break enabled @entity19 to power his way over for his landmark score before @entity31 took a return pass from @entity28 to score his side 's sixth try			1
@entity83 runs in to score @entity0 's final try warriors ' players can hardly contain their delight as they jump on try scorer @entity14 the @entity9 could not lay their hands on the ball and they were reeling further when @entity0 hit them with a 70 - metre try from @entity78 , fashioned by @entity50 and @entity151 , before @entity14 ran over the unfortunate @entity104 to register his second try			2
skipper @entity83 juggled with @entity50 's pass to touch down and @entity28 went the full length of the pitch after collecting a wayward kick from @entity157 to score for his ninth successive match			0
@entity51 took his goal tally to eight from 11 attempts and then rounded off the scoring with a drop goal .			0

half - back @entity51 bags 21 points as @entity0 move a step away from the @entity1
tries from @entity14 ( two ) , @entity51 , @entity106 , @entity113 , @entity19 , @entity31 , @entity170 , @entity83 and @entity28
@entity129 *replies* for @entity5
*giants* came into the game with six wins in seven
but @entity178 's *chastened* team must wait to find out who they face with *elimination* on the line
@entity0 go into the qualifying semi-finals , one win from @entity185
