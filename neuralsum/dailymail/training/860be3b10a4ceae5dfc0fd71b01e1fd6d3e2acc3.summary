whether its champagne , a private island or a @entity7 impersonator , sisters @entity1 , 34 , and @entity2 , 44 , know how to make the perfect first date happen			1
the sisters , both from @entity10 , set up their @entity12 planning business two months ago and say it all came about following a dinner party conversation			1
since then , they have put together everything from romantic picnics to beaches strewn with loving messages in a bottle for their clients			1
@entity21 ( right ) set up @entity12 romance with her sister @entity23 ( left ) and says that the pair are very close ‘ it all started a few years ago when @entity23 and i were at a dinner party in @entity29 one evening with some friends , ' explains @entity21			1
‘ the following day was the first wedding anniversary of the couple who were hosting the evening and at the end of the dinner the host stood up and said he wanted to give his wife her anniversary present – and whipped out a pair of keys			1
‘ everyone around the table presumed he had bought her a car and dashed to the window to look outside			2
but what did we see ? a sit on lawn - mower ! ' it was at that moment we realised that some people really do just need a bit of help when it comes to romance			1
’ ‘ after the ' lawnmower incident ' , everyone around the table started chatting about the most unromantic things their husbands had done and @entity23 and i found ourselves giving suggestions			2
‘ at the end of the party , we had 22 business cards in our hands from husbands who wanted our help			1
@entity21 and @entity23 enjoy a glass of champagne , @entity21 says they will often entertain clients in high end places such as @entity73 ' we now have the business cards framed , with our logo above , hanging in our office			1
it reminds us of how it all started			2
’ the sisters combined their experience of proposal planning ( @entity21 ) and production ( @entity23 ) to set up the business , which has gone from strength - to - strength			1
' when people plan something romantic they are often nervous , so seeing a smiling face is always important to them , ' explains @entity21			1
' you also have to be incredibly creative			2
one of our guarantees is that we will never arrange the same romantic experience twice			1
‘ in terms of our roles , i would say i am the ‘ creative ’ one			0
i come up with all of the ideas but sometimes i can get a bit carried away and @entity23 has rein me in			0
' she ’s more organised than me so she makes sure everything goes off without a hitch ! ' her favourite moments are many , although one - a first wedding anniversary surprise - stands out			0
' we recently planned a gorgeous first wedding anniversary surprise for one couple , ' she smiles			0
' they came from @entity10 but used to visit @entity107 quite a lot so on their anniversary they headed to the coast for a romantic weekend			2
‘ on the saturday afternoon , the husband suggested they go for a walk along the beach			0
there his wife kept stumbling across bottles in the sand with messages in them			0
' each message was a love note and in the last bottle there was a map to a personalised picnic we had set up for them			2
‘ around the picnic were reasons he loved her and promises he wanted to make to her			0
the food was the same food that had been served at their wedding – that was a big challenge ! @entity21 and @entity23 helped one client leave love notes in bottles down a beach in @entity107 for his wife @entity21 said that sourcing the food for their picnic - what they had eaten at their wedding - was a bit of a challenge ! ‘ while they were having their picnic , @entity23 and i were back at their house unveiling his anniversary gift to her - a huge marble table top , engraved with the signatures of all the guests who had been at their wedding			1
his wife was totally speechless when she saw it			0
’ successes like that , says @entity21 , are all the result of planning			1
‘ we always try and meet with clients face to face as we feel that ’s important , ' she explains			0
' we will usually meet somewhere glamorous like @entity73 or @entity165			0
although we ’re happy to travel outside of @entity10 if that ’s where they ’re based			0
‘ we try to find out as much as we can about their partner - from their likes and dislikes , to the type of person they are - sometimes we even ask for their @entity177 and @entity178 accounts so we can check them out for ourselves ! gorgeous love notes are just one of the things @entity21 and @entity23 help their clients set up ‘ once we have found out as much as we can , we then go away and come up with two personalised ideas			1
' when we give the ideas back to the guy ( complete with mood boards so he can really envisage what its about ) it ’s up to him if he wants to plan it himself or if we wants us to do it			0
' if we end up planning the whole experience then we still work with him throughout to make sure it is perfect for his partner			0
‘ most of our client 's partners want to meet us after the event and in some cases we have become lifelong friends , ' she continues			0
' just because a guy hires romance planners , it does n’t mean he has n’t put any effort in			2
in fact , we really force our men to contribute as much as possible			0
' he needs to know his girlfriend really well if we are to plan something perfect for her - that way he gets to take loads of credit too			0
’ when @entity220 decided that he wanted more from his 18 year friendship with his pal @entity222 , he called on @entity21 and @entity23 to organise what can only be described as the most over the top date ever			1
not only did he hire a @entity225 to pick her up from her home in @entity10 to take her to the coast , he hired out an entire island for her and organised performances from a @entity7 impersonator ( he 's @entity222 's favourite performer ) and a burlesque dancer			0
@entity220 hired out @entity233 for his date with @entity222 as she had always wanted to be stranded on an island with her perfect man luckily @entity220 and @entity222 's date went well and they are now a very happy couple at the end of his date he even revealed that he would soon be not only taking her to dinner at @entity165 , one of @entity10 's finest restaurants , but he 'd booked the pair of them a trip to @entity249			2
according to @entity21 all of his ( and their ! ) hard work paid off and the couple are now happily together			1
in fact @entity222 described the first date as having been , ' out of this world			2

sisters @entity1 and @entity2 set up @entity12 romance

@entity21 describes their business venture as ' the best job in the world '
