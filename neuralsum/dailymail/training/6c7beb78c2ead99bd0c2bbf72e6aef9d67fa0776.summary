just two hours after he gunned down unarmed teenager @entity1 following , he has claimed , a struggle for his life , @entity0 showed ‘ no apparent distress ’ and scant physical injury			1
information leaked by the @entity9 officer ’s supporters in the aftermath of the fatal shooting suggested that he had sustained facial injuries so severe that they called for x-rays and hospital treatment			1
now medical records released as part of the evidence presented to the @entity19 and reviewed by @entity20 reveal a very different scenario			2
the decision to @entity23 , 28 , was not a clinical one taken by his treating physician on the strength of his physical exam			0
instead it was @entity9 police chief @entity30 who demanded the officer be x-rayed			2
he claimed the teenager hurt him badly by punching him and that a third punch could have killed him @entity0 was photographed to document his injuries following the shooting of @entity1 in @entity9 , @entity39 on august 9 examined : pictures of @entity0 were taken shortly after the shooting and disclosed to the grand jury as it was considering whether to indict him for the killing of @entity1 reddening : one of the pictures showing the impact on @entity0 on what he described as being punched forcefully twice by @entity1 @entity47 : @entity0 told doctors that he was at six out of ten on the pain scale and that he felt badly hurt and the officer was discharged less than two hours after admission with a prescription for anti-inflammatory @entity54 - described in his doctor ’s statement as essentially ‘ prescription strength @entity54 ’ - and advice to ice his jaw if necessary			1
protesters tore the @entity39 city apart in the nights following the august 9 shooting			2
when the @entity19 ’s decision not to indict the @entity9 officer was announced on monday the city erupted once more with @entity1 ’s stepfather ’s screams of ‘ burn this b * * * * down ’ before @entity69 taken by some as a call to arms			1
chants of ‘ @entity77 do n’t shoot ’ - a reference to a now disputed eye - witness account - have echoed across the nation , with protests staged in 37 states			0
but while @entity9 burned @entity0 has maintained that he has a ‘ clear conscience ’ about the shooting			2
according to his statement @entity1 was the aggressor , wrestling for the officer ’s gun and punching him twice in the face so hard that he feared a third punch would kill him			1
but the medical records released in the evidence dump by prosecutor @entity90 show minimal physical injury and reveal @entity0 to be ‘ no apparent distress ’ shortly after this fatal encounter			1

notes made on the officer ’s admission quote @entity120 as stating , ‘ he needs x-rays he was hit in the face a couple of times ’ all of the x-rays taken are described as ‘ unremarkable studies			0
’ when interviewed by federal agents the treating physician recalled : ‘ he was brought in by his supervisor and two @entity132 detectives with the complaint of being punched in his jaw twice			0
‘ he complained of pain to the jaw area primarily the right jaw with a little bit of redness			0
’ evidence : @entity0 's evidence to the grand jury included his description of @entity1 's strength - ' i felt like a five - year - old holding onto @entity146 ' claim : how @entity0 told the grand jury he feared he was going to die at @entity1 's hands medical record : evidence disclosed to the grand jury showed @entity0 was ' atraumatic ' and ' in no apparent distress ' after shooting @entity1 result : @entity0 's records show he was discharged without doctors requiring further treatment , instead he was asked to discuss the assault with supervisors secret wedding : on monday morning , it was revealed that 28 - year - old @entity0 ( left ) - who has n't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer , @entity162 ( right ) , 37 , last month getting heard : protesters in @entity9 walked through various stores with their hands raised - something that has become a symbol of their anger over the shooting of unarmed @entity1 @entity0 himself rated his pain level as six out of ten on the pain scale			1

’ despite the impression of a vast disparity in size between @entity0 and @entity1 , at 6ft 4 @entity0 is the same height as the teenager though some 80lbs lighter .			0

@entity0 was examined by doctors shortly after he shot and killed @entity1 in @entity9 , @entity39 , on 9 august
medical records say he was ' atraumatic ' and showing no apparent signs of ' distress ' just hours after the killing
supporters of @entity0 claimed he was badly injured by @entity1 and @entity23 himself told grand jury he was punched twice
officer claimed he believed a third punch would kill him but medical records say he had only mild bruising and mild to minimal pain
doctors gave him mild *painkiller* and told him to ice his jaw - andx - rays were taken at insistence of police , not medical staff
