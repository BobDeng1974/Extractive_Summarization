by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 10:41 est , 12 november 2013 the flood - prone village of @entity3 near @entity6 's storm - battered coast is running out of time as coastal erosion creeps ever closer to the @entity9			1
as residents wait for a new village to be built on higher ground nine miles away , a dispute over who is in charge has led to a rare intervention by the @entity17			1
the bureau ruled that the sitting tribal council no longer represents the community of 350 as far as the agency is concerned			1
@entity23 boards connect houses in @entity3 , @entity6 - the flood - prone village near @entity6 's storm - battered coast council leaders are appealing the @entity17 's decision , which gave the funding - administrative power to a new group that claims it is the rightfully elected council			1
until the matter is resolved , millions of dollars in government funds for the relocation effort have been halted , as nature 's relentless erosion continues , oblivious to who is in charge			1
' who 's suffering here is the community members , ' said @entity41 , director of the state agency that administers the relocation grants			1
@entity3 is one of @entity6 's most eroded coastal villages and the only one that has begun a physical move , with the raging @entity47 steadily inching toward homes			1
officials estimate @entity3 , 480 miles west of @entity50 , has until the end of the decade before erosion causes severe damage			1
government funds have been used over the last seven years to build six homes , a barge landing , roads and five storage structures at the site of the new village			1
now those structures sit as reminders that a community 's dreams of a rebirth are still unrealized			2
' we 're just falling way back , ' said @entity68 , a longtime tribal administrator who is part of the group whose authority is no longer recognized			1
@entity17 has ruled that the sitting tribal council no longer represents the community of 350 residents in @entity3 , @entity6 in its ruling , the @entity17 said required elections were purportedly not held for more than seven years , so the old council had been operating on expired terms			1
the old council denies the allegations			0
the new council members were first elected in october 2012			0
the following month , members of the old council held another election			0
the resulting dispute reached a boiling point in june when the new council got more votes during a community meeting attended by both sides			1
that victory carried significant weight in the @entity17 's decision , which said its decision applies to such purposes as bureau funding			0
members of the new council have not responded to requests from @entity0 for comment			0
the state , which is not bound by the @entity17 decision , has been sitting on $ 6.5 million in reimbursable grant funds for the relocation effort , including proceeding with building out an evacuation center at the new location called @entity103			1
any payout has been delayed by the dispute and failure of the new faction to establish an official bank account until recently			2
the state expects to soon issue $ 51,000 in revenue sharing funds to the new council that should have been distributed last summer			2
relocations funds probably wo n't be disbursed until next spring at the earliest			2
adding to the complication , recent audits by the state concluded that the old faction mismanaged the administration of other relocation grants , such as changing the architectural design of the evacuation center after it took over the project from the state in 2011			2
the audit also noted apparent payroll improprieties , including exorbitant compensation for certain employees			0
the audit recommends that the tribe return about $ 300,000 to the state for alleged improprieties including duplicate payments on invoices and retroactive wages for employees			0
officials have denied any mismanagement			0
at the same time , members of the new council failed to hold a required election last month , saying they wanted to wait until the dispute was resolved , according to @entity138 of the state @entity139			2
he would have liked to have seen an election held so that anyone who wanted to run , including members of the old faction , could have done so			0
he said the issue will have to be revisited later			0
for now , there is no time to waste , so the state is recognizing the new council , @entity138 said			0
the @entity47 is swallowing more and more bank each year just south of the village			0
sinking permafrost continues to subject the area to flooding from intensifying storms blamed on climate change			0
' there 's a real need out there , ' he said .			0

millions of dollars in government funds for relocation have been halted because of a tribal dispute over who is in charge
