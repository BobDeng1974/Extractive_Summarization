when @entity1 tied the knot with @entity3 last summer , she secured her status as one of the world 's favourite style icons			2
the @entity10 - born lawyer , 37 , shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight - and her wardrobe got a high fashion makeover , too			1
she already wowed with a fashion - forward capsule wardrobe over her wedding in the summer , but as she stepped this week , @entity18 proved she 's not afraid to experiment with the season 's hottest - and most daring - trends			1
they were all the rage with the @entity36 set and boho beauties such as @entity38 , but flares are back with a vengeance this season - and @entity18 is bang - on - trend			1
how things have changed ! as a high - flying barrister , left , in 2011 , @entity18 stuck to more pared - back style classics , such as beige trench coats and muted grey suits but today , right , she is rocking the most daring trends in her own sophisticated way @entity48 2015 find some similar flares at @entity50 visit site @entity22 is really going all out for the flared trouser trend at the moment			1
it 's her second night out this week , and whilst last time she revisited the @entity32 via her bell bottom jeans by @entity56 , today 's trousers are not so subtle			2
check out the bold yellow chevron print ! they 're by @entity24 , @entity18 's go - to designer label when she wants to make a style statement			1
that floral embellished dress she wore the day after her wedding ? that was @entity24			0
the leopard print coat she wore for dinner with @entity3 's mother in @entity27 on monday ? yep , you guessed it ! @entity18 was n't in a matchy matchy mood so swapped the jacket they were shown with ( pictured ) for a black feather trim top and added platform heels and a clutch bag			1

on monday , @entity18 rocked flared jeans by @entity56 and teamed them with a retro inspired leopard print coat from @entity24 's @entity115 2015 collection featuring a cream trim detail and sheepskin collar			1
the looks - and those she has been quietly championing over the last six months - are a far cry from the more safe , corporate style she embraced before meeting @entity3			2
as a high - flying barrister , @entity18 stuck to more pared - back style classics , such as beige trench coats and muted grey suits			2
@entity129 , she toted high street handbags and chunky block heel shoes or @entity132 - a far cry from high - end looks she loves today			0
@entity22 experimented with bold colours and eye - catching accessories as she enjoyed a romantic dinner date with husband @entity3 in @entity27 @entity1 looked chic and sophisticated - and added her own stamp on a classic black dress with white gloves - at the @entity141 in january as well as pulling off the season 's most savvy trends with aplomb , she has apparently done it all by herself without the help of a single stylist			2
as the @entity149 reports : ' according to fashion sources , she has eschewed the offers of stylists and personal assistants and prefers to trust her own instincts			0
' speaking about her style transformation , fashion writer @entity155 said : ' @entity18 is surely now the first lady of @entity159 ? she has got the high - profile hubby , has her own amazing career , will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe			1
' from monochrome @entity165 to stand - out red @entity168 dresses via trendy bell bottoms and midriff - baring tops , she is working the trends in her own classy way			0
' women will want her wardrobe , and they will try and emulate her looks			0
she 's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making			0
' she is always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her			0
she wears couture exactly as it 's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence - and wears more daring looks with sophistication			0
' what a women ! what a clever woman ! '			0
her style was classic in 2011 , left , but she 's put a high - fashion spin on her signature look in recent months - and apparently does n't employ a stylist two years ago , pictured , @entity18 championed an altogether different style to today and fashion writer @entity155 says she 's come a long way and women will want her wardrobe of today			1

@entity18 , 37 , rocked season 's hottest flares twice in one week
also *trialled* the crop top trend and pulled it off with sophistication
her high fashion looks are a far cry from her *conservative* 2011 style
