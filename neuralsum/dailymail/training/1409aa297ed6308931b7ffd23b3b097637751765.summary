every @entity2 , one @entity1 player could be counted upon to give out presents to 30 or more staff at the club 's training ground as a personal thank you for their work and friendship during the year			1
@entity14 's deadline day free transfer to @entity15 wo n't have made the global headlines of @entity18 's world - record move to @entity19 , for example , but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31 - year - old @entity22 who has left @entity23 after 12 memorable years			1
@entity14 would banter with the canteen ladies , enquire about the families of the ground staff and away from the club would be seen shopping on the high street in @entity29 with his two young boys just like any other family man			1
and that , in addition to his 340 first - team appearances , is what he will be best remembered within the inner sanctum at @entity1			1
@entity1 's official @entity55 account wished him well the way he came back from a career - threatening illness , ulcerative colitis , also endeared him to the greater @entity1 family who were so desperately worried about the thinning figure in front of them , there was almost relief when the condition was announced rather than it being a terminal illness			2
in many ways , @entity14 was a historical figure , the last of the “ @entity70 fledglings ” who was personally wooed by sir @entity70 to ensure he ended up at @entity1 from @entity72 rather than a clutch of other clubs who wanted him			1
@entity70 played snooker with @entity14 at his house as he sought to sign him			1
he saw him as a long - term successor to @entity80 who was at the time on his way to @entity19			0
@entity14 could pass , get around the pitch , and had the mental strength not to be overawed by playing for @entity85 's biggest club			2
after @entity14 , the game changed – young stars could come in from around the world and in any case @entity70 got older and would start to spend more time delegating than personally overseeing the signings of the next big thing			1
we 're now seeing @entity14 in the context of his brave battle with his condition – it was so serious at one point he needed an operation to stop the risk of his bowel exploding , and he did n't play for a year after @entity101 – but it is worth remembering he was a fantastic player at his peak , with his best season probably coming in 2008/09			2
@entity14 enjoyed a memorable 12 years at @entity1 in which he appeared 342 times sir @entity70 personally secured the signature of the young @entity22 amid interest from other clubs with @entity109 injured , @entity14 was one of the star performers during a season which saw @entity1 win their third @entity113 title in a row and reach the @entity116 final			1
@entity70 at the time said @entity14 had become ' a key performer for us in major games			1
' the only cloud was he missed the final itself for a red card sustained against @entity124 in the semi			0
typically , he dealt with the setback in such an unfussy manner it is barely remembered compared to @entity129 and @entity130 being suspended for the 1999 final			0
nonetheless , @entity1 badly missed his drive in midfield as @entity134 and @entity135 dominated and @entity136 easily won 2 - 0 in @entity137			1
not surprisingly , @entity14 has n't been quite the same player since returning from his illness even though he has made 13 appearances this season			2
manager @entity32 wanted @entity14 to remain – his influence in a dressing - room of so many new signings was huge – but the club felt they could n't stand in the player 's way if he wanted first - team football , an attitude the @entity22 is grateful for			1
@entity14 's work with charity , including the @entity153 , has also bee recognised @entity155 keeper @entity154 is n't alone among new additions at @entity23 to hold @entity14 in high regard ' @entity1 are a fantastic club and i 've got so many great memories there but i feel it 's time for a new challenge for me , ' he has said following his move to join @entity163 at @entity164			1
' i have n't had as many games as i would like this season and , after everything i 've been through , i 'm a professional football player			0
i want to play football and hopefully i can do that at @entity15			2
they 've given me the opportunity to do that			0
' i 'm leaving @entity1 but i 've got so many happy memories and got to know so many great people there i 'm leaving with a smile on my face			2
' i spoke to the manager [ @entity32 ] about not playing as much as i wanted and the club did n't really want me to go but they respected my wishes			0
@entity14 is mobbed by team - mates including @entity180 after scoring during a pre-season friendly against @entity182 , however , he went on to appear just 13 times this season with only five starts @entity14 's move has't garnered the attention that met @entity18 's world - record departure , but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31 - year - old @entity72 international ' the manager and ( executive vice chairman ) @entity191 have been fantastic			1
i can not speak highly enough of them			0
i have great respect for them and how they have dealt with this			0
they helped me as much as possible and made the move possible			0
i have to thank them for being professional and catering for my wishes			0
' @entity14 won five @entity113 titles with @entity1 and has a @entity116 winners ' medal as an unused substitute from the 2008			2
but his real legacy at the club is the hearts and minds he won over			0
his international team - mate @entity209 once described @entity14 as the “ @entity210 ” of the @entity72 team			1
' you look up to him because of what he 's done , ' said @entity209			0
it could equally apply at @entity1			0
has there ever have been a more popular player in the club 's history among work colleagues , both on and off the pitch ?			0

@entity15 signing @entity14 will be missed at @entity1
the midfielder is hugely popular with fellow players and club staff
he was wooed personally by sir @entity70 and stayed for 12 years
@entity37 , @entity154 and @entity34 among team - mates past and present to pay *tribute* to the departed @entity23 *stalwart*
