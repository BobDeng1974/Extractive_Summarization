light snack : a chandelier made from over 8500 gummiy bears has been created by artist @entity24 tasty art : his sculpture take months to complete and straddle the line between sculpture and mosaic intricate : none of the gummy bears were painted and each batch had to be cast in the right colour his artwork ' @entity37 is an @entity39 flag made up of 44,450 urethane army men cast in red , white , and blue , while ' what remains ' is a five foot wide skull mosaic made up of more than 35,000 tiny flowers			1
' a @entity44 ' is another candy - themed work and uses more than 15,000 acrylic pieces of candy and weighs 75lbs			0
he starts by building silicone moulds of the original pieces , then casts them in colour , meaning nothing is painted , each hue has to be mixed and cast using various resins			0
the final objects numbering in the tens of thousands are then painstaking glued to a surface piece by piece , meaning that the entire process for each artwork spans several months to design , sculpt and cast			0
good enough to eat ? : those with a sweet tooth will be disappointed to learn the treats are cast in acrylic art : other works by mr @entity4 include a human skull made from tiny flowers and a rose created using various types of sweets			1
