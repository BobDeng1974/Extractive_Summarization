pictured are staff demonstrating at a @entity1 depot in @entity33 yesterday but the bid was deemed unacceptable and administrators @entity35 announced that 2,356 jobs at the parcel delivery firm were to be lost			1
the administrators said 371 people have been retained to deal with remaining parcels and to assist in realising the @entity43 's assets and winding down its operations			2
@entity35 said the offer made by a consortium ' offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired '			0
they said : ' the administrators proposed an alternative structure that would be acceptable and common in these situations			0
' the consortium , despite attempts to make them reconsider , declined to amend their original offer			0
' the redundancies will affect the head office in @entity59 as well as hubs and depots around the country			1
there will be 468 job losses in ' @entity65 ' , which includes head office staff , and a further 279 staff will lose their jobs in the @entity59 hub			1

@entity75 , joint administrator of @entity76 , said : ' it is with regret that we have to announce substantial redundancies at @entity76 , which ceased accepting new parcels on 24 december 2014			0
the company endured substantial losses in the run up to @entity9 and announced they were entering administration on @entity9 ' the company endured substantial losses , which ultimately became too great for it to continue as a going concern , and @entity76 entered administration following an unsuccessful sale process			1
' at meetings across @entity76 's @entity74 sites on monday 29 december 2014 and tuesday 30 december 2014 , employees were informed that there would be substantial redundancies as no new business was being taken on			2
' many of these employees were sent home , and informed that they would shortly receive formal correspondence to confirm their work status			0
' business secretary @entity19 said : " this is very sad news for the @entity1 workers and their families at a particularly difficult time of year			2
" the government has put arrangements in place to help employees who are made redundant and we stand ready to help			0
" @entity1 employees and self - employed drivers who have their contracts terminated as a result of @entity1 's administration will be able to access the government 's rapid response service , which draws together local partners such as @entity115 and the skills bodies to deliver support for each person affected			2
" in addition , a @entity120 page has been set - up to link up companies holding suitable vacancies with those who have been made redundant , so if drivers can be redeployed into new jobs in this competitive buoyant market they will be			0
" meanwhile the @entity16 union said the failure to secure jobs was a ' a disgraceful and cynical betrayal '			1
secretary general mr @entity14 said : ' the confirmation from the administrators that they have just sacked 2400 staff and are pulling the plug on any efforts to save @entity1 is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members , many of whom are owed thousands of pounds			1
' @entity16 does not believe that those pulling the strings had any interest in saving this business and were happy to cut and run leaving a trail of human misery in their wake			0
the @entity1 collapse has blown the lid off the cosy relationship between bandit capitalism and the political elite			2
administrators estimate that around 30,000 parcels are still being held at @entity1 's 53 depots around the country ' @entity16 will continue to advise and represent our members caught in this corporate failure			1
those responsible will slink away with their own resources ring fenced and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy tab			0
the @entity167 destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words			0
' while @entity176 's shadow cabinet secretary for finance , @entity175 , said : ' our first thoughts are with the workers and their families who have found out that they have lost their jobs			2
this is a terrible way for them to start the @entity184			0
' it is essential that the @entity186 now sends in a task force to provide the highest level and best quality support to the people who have been made redundant			0
many of these @entity1 depots are located in parts of @entity194 that already have high levels of unemployment			2
they can not afford more people out of work			0
' the first duty of the @entity186 now is to find work for these men and women , including retraining them for other opportunities			0
' yesterday staff returned to @entity1 depots for the first time since the news of the company 's collapse broke on christmas day			1
it saw protests held by staff and @entity16 union members outside a number of @entity1 depots across the country			1

customers who have sent parcels and intended recipients are being advised that depots remain open for items to be picked up ( file picture ) the veteran venture capitalist claimed that taxpayers would not foot ' much of a bill ' for redundancy payments for the firm 's staff as @entity1 has ' paid a fortune ' in taxes since @entity219 took it over in april 2013			1
