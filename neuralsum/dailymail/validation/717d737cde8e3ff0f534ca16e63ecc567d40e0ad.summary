@entity1 ’s title winners were handed a new incentive to reach the @entity3 of the @entity4 after @entity5 confirmed large increases in the cash sums on offer			1
champions for the last three season , @entity9 earned £ 12.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14			1
the same performance next season would bring in at least £ 16m under the new figures announced by @entity20 ’s governing body — and that does not include ticket sales			1
confirming the cash ‘ cycle ’ for the next three years , @entity5 will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to @entity4 and @entity28 clubs			1
a @entity1 club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of £ 4m			1
significantly , however , the three @entity1 clubs that enter the @entity28 qualifiers will now cover their costs via a solidarity payment of £ 150,000 – even if they crash out at the first hurdle			1
@entity9 failed to make the @entity4 this season , crashing out to @entity39 in the qualifiers @entity40 saves against @entity41 in the last @entity43 clash at the @entity44 @entity9 line up against @entity41 but the @entity47 club will be greedy for the @entity4 rewards yet , the @entity28 remains very much the lesser of @entity5 ’s tournaments and @entity50 , who failed to navigate @entity9 to the @entity4 this season , will now come under increasing pressure to deliver qualification – and bigger rewards - this summer			1
currently top of the league table and chasing four - in - a - row , the @entity47 side can expect to make over £ 10m if they retain their title and reach next season ’s group stage – even if they fail to win a point - an increase from £ 6.4m			1
broadcasting pool revenues will also rise while the prize for a win will increasing to £ 1.1m and a draw will bring in £ 362,000			0
the rewards for reaching the last 16 – as @entity9 did most recently in 2012 – will now leap by a whopping £ 4m			1
the biggest winners – as always – will be the @entity69 clubs with their huge broadcasting pool			0
if an @entity72 side were to win next season ’s @entity4 , they would earn around £ 74m from central @entity5 funds alone			1
yet what is good for the elite — and what is good for @entity9 — is not necessarily good for @entity1 football			2
most – outwith @entity79 - assume the @entity47 side will retain their title at the end of this campaign and will have another crack at the @entity85 elite			0
becoming champions of @entity1 is no guarantee of @entity4 participation , of course , yet the prospect of a £ 16m - £ 20m windfall is a strong incentive to get it right this time			1
for @entity9 chief executive @entity94 , it ’s an imperative			0
the fear is that more @entity5 cash only widens the gap between the aristos and the proletariat			2
not only in @entity20 , but in countries like @entity1 where more @entity102 money allows @entity9 to lord it while the others eat cake			2
@entity105 scores in the @entity106 for @entity9 in their 6 - 1 loss in the 2013 group stages @entity9 enjoyed a glamour tie against @entity111 in the group stages of the 2013 @entity4 instalment @entity5 said the changes are a bid to address this , to narrow the gap between the elite competition and the @entity28 — the level @entity120 clubs realistically aspire to — with general secretary @entity121 insisting : ‘ @entity5 is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the @entity4 and @entity28 but also strengthens @entity5 ’s solidarity principle , namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs			1
‘ in this way , the new system provides a better deal for everyone , especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two @entity5 club competitions			1
this is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of @entity5 ’s key values			0
’ for every pound @entity5 give to clubs in the @entity28 currently @entity4 clubs receive £ 4.30			1
from next season that ratio will narrow			0
crucially , where clubs like @entity79 , @entity148 , @entity149 or @entity150 are concerned , there will also be the new solidarity payments for those who crash out of the @entity28 at the qualifying stage			2
this has long been the norm for @entity1 clubs , their pain heightened by the cost of flying to far - flung remote outposts in @entity161 , @entity162 or @entity163			0
potentially very good for @entity9 , then , @entity5 's announcement should also make @entity102 football more appealing and rewarding to those further down the food chain			2
@entity168 , partner of the @entity169 of @entity170 , told @entity171 : ‘ what uefa are saying is that from next season the revenues from the two competitions will be put into one pot and distributed to all the clubs participating			0
‘ so there is more money going to the @entity28 and , let ’s be honest , when you are thinking about @entity1 clubs now that ’s what you are really talking about			2
‘ there is more money now coming into the @entity28 and more potentially available to @entity1 ’s participants via solidarity payments if they do n’t make it to the group stage			1
‘ in the @entity4 , which might affect @entity9 , they are going up 60 per cent			2
‘ but more pertinent to @entity1 is the fact that solidarity payments for failing to reach the @entity28 will be higher			0
‘ what that should ensure is an end to the scenario where @entity1 teams knocked out in the early qualifying rounds of the @entity28 lose money when they are sent to the furthest corner of @entity20			0
‘ some @entity1 clubs like @entity202 have lost money spending fortunes chartering planes			0
‘ to make £ 150,000 just for getting knocked out in the first qualifier plus revenue from the home tie should cover the costs of the away leg			0
’ that covering the costs of defeat has become a @entity1 priority is mildly depressing			0
yet @entity9 used the @entity28 group stage as a parachute after @entity4 failure last season			1
and , as @entity168 explained : ‘ the group stage of the @entity28 will also offer a substantial increase of 65 per cent			2
participation could see clubs make £ 4m now			2
’ for @entity223 , much of this will be a source of anguish			0
with a stated goal of competing with @entity9 as soon as possible , the gap becomes more and more difficult to bridge every year their rivals win the @entity1 title and have another crack at the @entity4			1
on a day they announced more financial losses , the @entity235 board – and others around the country - can see just how difficult it will be to challenge the @entity47 side as the country ’s dominant force			0
@entity168 argues differently , however , and added : ‘ @entity9 could make £ 3m to £ 4m for reaching the group stage and for a club like @entity9 , playing in @entity1 , that is big money			1
‘ but that barely pays for another striker , never mind his wages			0
it could affect competition if they were winning the league and qualifying season after season after season , but will that really destroy competition ? i ’m not sure			0
‘ it ’s good to see , but i ’m not sure it will widen the gulf in @entity1 football			0
‘ if anything , we will see other @entity1 clubs earn more cash via the @entity28 and , therefore , the teams finishing second , third and fourth in the @entity264 have more opportunity to earn more money			2
‘ we are talking about more money being made available to clubs that do n’t make it into any competition			0
