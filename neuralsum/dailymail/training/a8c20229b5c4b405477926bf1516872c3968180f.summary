overall , six out of ten people think public services have maintained or improved their @entity16 welcomed the poll ’s findings , but accused the @entity6 of failing to give its own poll due prominence in its news bulletins			1
glee : @entity24 expressed his delight at the @entity6 being forced to admit services had got better @entity28 chairman @entity27 said the corporation had been among the first to scaremonger about the impact of the government ’s austerity measures to reduce @entity34 ’s budget deficit , and accused it of downplaying its own findings that voters do not agree			1
‘ their survey obviously did n’t produce the results they expected			2
it did n’t fit their agenda			0
so they buried it way down their broadcast list and made it tough to find on their website , ’ mr @entity27 said			0
‘ they were the first to talk doom when we took these measures to stop @entity34 going bust			0
better : in most areas only around on in five people think services have got worse int he last five years quality : the survey revealed that satisfaction was highest among the people who actually use the services in question a @entity28 minister has lashed out at the @entity6 over its coverage of climate change , claiming it gives too much prominence to sceptics			1
the climate change minister complained that the publicly - funded @entity6 still focused on the ' sterile ' debate over whether global warming existed when most scientists are firmly in one camp			1
he told the @entity73 : ' in the case of the @entity6 they have a very clear statutory responsibility			2
it 's in the original charter to inform			0
' i think we need the @entity6 to look very hard , particularly at whether or not they are getting the balance right			2
i do n't think they are			0
' he added : ' i think there is too much focus on trying to stimulate an increasingly sterile debate on the science , given the overwhelming body of opinion that there is now in favour of the science , and perhaps if they are wanting to have an active debate they should be talking about the policy responses to that science , rather than the science itself			0
' i 'm not trying to ban all dissenting voices but we are doing the public a disservice by treating them as equal , which is not the case			0

professor @entity113 , of the @entity114 , said the findings would be used by the @entity116 to demonstrate that cuts do not necessarily lead to poorer services			2
he added : ‘ ministers are likely to use this poll to argue for further cuts			0
’ local government minister @entity122 said : ‘ this survey shows that in many areas such as rubbish collections , schools and libraries , services and value for money are improving , illustrating how councils can both deliver sensible savings and protect the frontline			1
’ a @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ we ’re surprised by any claim we have n’t reasonably covered the finding of the @entity137 report into public services			1
‘ this has been reported widely across the @entity6 , including on @entity140 , the today programme , 5live , @entity142 , and the @entity143			2
it is also currently in the running orders for the evening bulletins			0
’ they should put the same energy into explaining what ’s actually happened			0
as this government made difficult cuts to prevent this country from going bust , the @entity6 led their news with any survey suggesting @entity156 would follow			1
‘ the fact is , instead of listening to the daily scare stories of the last few years , families recognised that crucial savings needed to be made , waste has been cut , efficiency injected and services actually improved – that ’s a story that deserves proper coverage across all sides of the media			2
’ at prime minister ’s questions , @entity24 mocked the @entity6 ’s grudging report of its poll , saying he thought he had ‘ died and gone to heaven ’ when he heard it			1
