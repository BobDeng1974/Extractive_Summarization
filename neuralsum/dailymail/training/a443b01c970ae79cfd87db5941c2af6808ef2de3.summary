by @entity0 justice secretary @entity1 says the taxpayer should not longer fund the system one firm of solicitors was paid almost £ 15million in taxpayer - funded legal aid in a year , while 20 individual barristers each raked in more than £ 300,000 , startling official figures reveal			1
in a graphic illustration of the legal aid gravy train , the @entity9 released a breakdown of payments to lawyers			1
among them was that to @entity19 - based firm @entity17 , which deals with immigration and asylum cases and topped the payout list for 2011/12			2
only established in 1998 , @entity17 , which has become one of the country ’s fastest growing firms of solicitors , billed taxpayers for a total of £ 14.63million in civil legal aid			2
tuckers , based in @entity19 , @entity32 and @entity33 , earned the most from publicly - funded criminal cases , taking £ 8.27million			2
immigration , human rights and corporate fraud barrister @entity35 was the highest - earning legal aid criminal barrister , earning £ 493,022			2
his high profile cases include defending @entity40 – jailed for supplying heroin and cocaine worth over £ 1million in 2007			2
@entity43 , a @entity19 - based qc who works in a range of fields including family law and personal injury , topped the list of legal aid payments in civil cases , earning £ 428,192			1
justice secretary @entity1 said the figures demonstrated that it was ‘ not sustainable ’ for taxpayers to keep funding a legal aid system that has become one of the most expensive in the world			1
mr @entity1 accused lawyers of going into ‘ overdrive ’ and making ‘ over the top ’ claims to try to attack @entity59 plans to reduce the legal aid bill			1
barristers and solicitors have demonstrated against planned cuts to the service ministers are planning to cut £ 220million from the annual criminal legal aid budget in @entity68 and @entity69 and have already slashed £ 350million from the legal aid bill for civil cases			0
they are consulting on plans to make lawyers compete for contracts and introduce a household disposable income cap , to remove the right of the best off to ask the taxpayer to foot the bill for their representation in court			1
criminal defendants living in households with a disposable income of £ 37,500 or more will be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid , while prisoners ’ rights to support will also be curbed			0
but yesterday leading barristers and human rights campaigners demonstrated on the road outside the @entity9 , waving placards that read ‘ justice is not for sale ’ and ‘ defend legal aid ’			1
human rights campaigner and @entity99 ’s ex-wife @entity97 , who addressed yesterday ’s protest , said : ‘ the legal aid lawyers are really paid very little			1
legal workers claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with specialist expertise ‘ we are not talking about people who earn a lot of money			1
do we want to cut services and legal aid so that we will have a risk of miscarriages of justice ? let ’s remember that 45 per cent of all people that are charged turn out to be innocent			1
’ a retired senior judge , sir @entity122 , claimed plans to overhaul legal aid would remove the right of defendants to choose a solicitor and hit those who needed lawyers with specialist expertise			1
mr @entity1 accused lawyers of using an ‘ evocative and creative defence ’ to try to protect legal aid – pointing out that a single trial can cost more than £ 10million in fees			1
‘ at around £ 2billion a year , we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world			0
at a time of major financial challenges , felt by businesses and households across the country , the legal sector can not be excluded from our commitment to getting the best value for money for the taxpayer , ’ he told the @entity134			0
@entity148 ‘ our proposals absolutely protect the right to a fair trial			0
good lawyers will still be available , just as they are now , as contracts will only be awarded to those who meet clear quality standards			1
’ the justice secretary said the government currently spent more on legal aid than on preventing criminals reoffending or apprenticeships			1
‘ sir @entity122 , who retired as a @entity162 judge last year , insisted the plans risked harming a system of fair justice			1
‘ if i ’m arrested in @entity167 on a complex fraud case , for example , i would be able under the present system to find maybe a solicitors in @entity19 or @entity33 , or wherever it may be , who specialise in difficult fraud cases , ’ he said			1
someone will turn up at the door and say “ i ’m representing you			0
and by the way , i ’m employed by the following company ”			0
’ a spokesman for @entity17 said it provided legal advice and assistance to approximately 25,000 clients a year , adding : ‘ many of our fee earners have enhanced accreditation qualifications and panel memberships with the @entity188 and have been acknowledged as experts in their fields within the legal community			0
‘ at a time where the government has made and continues to make drastic cuts to the provision of legal aid , @entity17 is one of the few established firms left providing legal advice and assistance under the legal aid scheme , making it possible for members of the public , many of them vulnerable , to have continued access to justice			1
’ @entity206 @entity207 received £ 1million in legal aid the legal profession – which stands to lose more than £ 200million a year in fees – has been fighting the most ferocious lobbying campaign against cuts to the £ 1billion criminal legal aid budget			0
in order to make their case , lawyers and their supporters have focused on highly emotive issues			2
for instance , sir @entity122 told the @entity221 that – because defendants will no longer be able to pick whichever lawyer they want – disabled suspects might be left with somebody who does not understand their condition			0
the @entity9 dismisses this criticism , saying all lawyers under the new regime will have to meet rigorous standards			1
but , in any case , it is hugely misleading to suggest mr @entity1 ’s reforms are designed to target the poor and the vulnerable			1
rather , they will reduce the income of some of the best paid lawyers in the land , stop prisoners making frivolous claims against the @entity242 and turn off the legal aid tap to the very wealthy			2
currently , the best paid qcs can rake in more than £ 500,000 in a single year , usually by working on complicated cases which the legal system manages to stretch out for months and even years			2
in 2010/11 , more than £ 1.5million from public funds went to just three barristers			0
in so - called ‘ very high cost cases ’ , which last more than 90 days , payments will now be reduced by 30 per cent			2
with fees standing at £ 500 - a - day for advocacy , plus up to £ 150 per hour for preparation work , lawyers will struggle to convince the public they are being hard done by			2
in other measures , defendants living in households with a ‘ disposable income ’ of £ 37,500 or more are to be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid			0
in reality , this will not affect anybody earning less than £ 100,000 - a - year			0
but it will mean that the likes of the former fugitive @entity207 would no longer be able to take the taxpayer for a ride			0
@entity207 – who rented a £ 23,000 - a - month @entity19 residence during his trial – received £ 1,056,588			0
other criminals who have milked the system include convicted gangster @entity272 , who got £ 4.7million			2
then there are criminals who have already been convicted			0
the @entity275 ( the existence of which speaks volumes ) said mr @entity1 ’s reforms would effectively remove legal aid for all prison law issues other than parole and disciplinary hearing			1
again , once the detail is known , they may struggle to convince the public this is a bad thing			0
currently , taxpayers are handing nearly half a million pounds in legal aid every week to prisoners making human rights claims			0
last october , one of the country ’s most senior judges , @entity291 , warned that human rights laws meant ‘ unthinkable ’ cases were coming before the courts			0
he hit out as he dismissed a case brought by two prisoners – rapist @entity299 , who was given legal aid , and paedophile @entity301 – who demanded an end to ‘ slopping out ’			0
they were unhappy at having no toilet in their cell .			0
