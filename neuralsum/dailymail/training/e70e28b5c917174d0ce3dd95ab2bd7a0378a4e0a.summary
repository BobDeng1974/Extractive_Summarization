@entity0 looks at the problems surrounding @entity2 at @entity3 this term @entity3 defender @entity5 admits the forthcoming warm - weather training break is a chance for players to generate a greater team spirit			1
a dire goalless draw at home to @entity12 extended the @entity3 ' win-less run to eight matches and the @entity16 left - back accepts the growing criticism may have led some players to look after themselves			1
cracks seemed to appear against the @entity12 when @entity20 stepped up to take a penalty - traditionally the role of @entity5 with 15 successful conversions from 16 - and hit the post			1
@entity5 ( centre ) goes in for a challenge during @entity3 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity12 the @entity3 have not won in eight games and currently sit four points above the relegation zone @entity3 0 - 0 @entity12 @entity31 2 - 2 @entity3 ( lost on penalties ) @entity3 1 - 1 @entity33 @entity3 1 - 1 @entity31 @entity34 2 - 0 @entity3 @entity35 3 - 2 @entity3 @entity3 0 - 1 @entity36 @entity37 3 - 0 @entity3 forwards @entity38 and @entity39 tried to persuade the @entity40 international he was making a mistake and after his failure @entity39 could be seen publicly questioning his international team - mate with manager @entity2 on the touchline			1
with no @entity49 action this weekend the squad are heading overseas for an intensive few days training and that break may now be more important than ever			1
' it is like a mini pre-season in a way , ' said @entity5			1
' we have been spending a lot of time together anyway but to go away is a nice change of scenery			2
' hopefully it gets a bit more spirit among the lads and keeps everyone together because when you are not winning games and there is a lot of criticism it is easy to look after yourself			2
' we have to stay together and look after each other and hopefully this trip will be beneficial in all those ways			2
' the players will be challenged in a number of areas while they are away , not least in terms of why they have fallen so far off the pace they set last season			2
' it is similar to what we did last season			2
we 'll have some hard sessions in the morning and some tactical stuff in the afternoon , ' he told evertontv			0
@entity20 ( 2nd left ) demanded to take a penalty against the @entity12 , despite @entity5 ' reservations the @entity40 international reacts after missing the spot kick that would have ended @entity3 's dismal run ' it is a chance to go away , take a step back and look at where we are going wrong because we are going wrong at the moment and it gives us more time together to put things right , ' the intention is to have more opportunity to put more work in and cover some more points that we need to address so hopefully it will be beneficial			1
' @entity103 has so often been @entity3 's stronghold but this season they have taken just 14 points from 11 matches and the @entity12 display was arguably the worst seen at home under @entity2			1
@entity109 is becoming more audible by the week but the @entity3 boss could not say whether that was impacting on the players			2
' it is difficult to answer that			0
we all share the same frustration , ' he said			0
' we want to win the game and perform well			0
the players had the perfect attitude and mindset that allowed us to control the game			0
' you do n't see many games in the @entity124 when the opposition has no shots on target			1
' the second half we all got frustrated , the players to the crowd and vice-versa			0
' @entity2 watches on - his side have taken only 14 points from 33 at @entity103 this term by contrast , @entity134 has not lost a game or conceded a goal since arriving at the @entity138 the penalty furore took much of the focus away from another well - drilled @entity12 performance which had all the hallmarks of new manager @entity134			1
since he took over earlier this month they have not conceded a goal in three matches and the former @entity36 and @entity148 boss is still unbeaten			0
' as a group you ca n't criticise them in any shape , ' @entity134 said			0
' everybody has bought into what we are trying to do			0
' this is a real struggle down at the bottom			0
there are so many good teams down there and i think it will go to the wire			0

@entity3 are leaving on an overseas break to boost @entity124 season
