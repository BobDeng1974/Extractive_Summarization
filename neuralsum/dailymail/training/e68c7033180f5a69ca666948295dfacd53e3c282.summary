meteoric rise : model @entity1 raked in £ 2.4 million in the past year alone from @entity3 and becoming the face of @entity6 cosmetics as she strutted down the red carpet at the @entity8 in @entity9 last week , pausing to pose artfully for photographers , @entity1 looked every inch the supermodel			1
showing off her willowy frame in a black bandeau and long skirt by @entity17 designer @entity16 , on sunday the 24 - year - old mingled with the likes of @entity20 and @entity21 , eclipsing both with one dazzling smile			1
feted as one of the most beautiful women on the planet — that rare combination of feminine elegance and cool — she seemed perfectly at ease in such celebrated company			0
her name may not yet be as globally famous as theirs , but @entity33 has just made @entity1 the first black @entity35 woman to gain a place on its list of the world ’s highest - earning models			1
she raked in £ 2.4 million in the past year alone , working for the likes of @entity3 and becoming the face of @entity6 cosmetics			1
her high - flying career has seen her model for every major fashion house , appear on numerous @entity46 covers and appear in catwalk shows from @entity48 to @entity49			0
it has earned her a bevy of celebrity friends , including model of the moment @entity55 , as well as singer @entity56 , not to mention a jet - setting lifestyle and an army of fans who follow her every word on @entity63			0
a gilded existence indeed , but @entity1 ’s ascendency has not been quite as smooth as her polished appearance might suggest			1
the great - granddaughter of @entity69 immigrants who came to @entity35 in the early sixties in search of a better life , she comes from a long line of strong , independent women often let down by the men in their lives			2
she was raised in @entity77 , @entity78 , by a single mother who took on three jobs to make ends meet after @entity1 ’s father left the family home when she was a toddler			1
@entity1 then became a single mother herself after becoming pregnant at 18 , just as her modelling career was taking off			1
her son @entity87 , now four , was born in 2009 with sickle cell anaemia , a blood disorder he inherited from @entity90 and her then boyfriend , @entity91			2
if that was n’t enough to cope with , @entity91 was arrested ( and later jailed ) for drugs offences two months after the baby ’s birth			1
a tumultuous young life , then , but a family friend told the @entity98 that the @entity1 family are ‘ incredibly strong ’			1
‘ if you do , it ’s like fooling around with a hornet ’s nest			0
they are very loyal and they look after each other			0
they ’re survivors , particularly the women			0
right from the moment the @entity1 family arrived in this country , they were aspirational			1
’ if proof were needed of just how far the @entity1 family has come since leaving the parish of @entity116 in @entity69 in the early @entity70 , a trip to the gritty streets of @entity119 in @entity120 would provide it			2
there , outside @entity123 in july , a small blue heritage plaque was unveiled to the @entity125 , the @entity35 ’s first home - grown reggae band , which performed on @entity128 , sang with @entity129 and was , for a time , managed by @entity130			0
among the five - strong group , which still occasionally performs together , is @entity1 ’s grandfather , bassist @entity133			2
on the day the plaque was unveiled , @entity1 was jetting to @entity135 for her latest assignment			2
somehow , you imagine @entity133 would understand her not being there			0
for @entity1 ’s career has been the epitome of glamour , in direct contrast to her unstarry upbringing			2
her father , accounts clerk @entity145 , who was 21 when she was born , left the family home when his daughter was just three and has since remarried and started a new family			0
determined to support @entity1 and her two younger brothers , @entity152 , now 21 , and 17 - year - old @entity153 , her mother @entity150 juggled three jobs as a receptionist and secretary while raising her children			1
family : she became pregnant at 18 just as her modelling career kicked off			1
@entity87 ( pictured in 2012 ) is now four @entity150 ’s mother @entity160 , who knew from bitter experience how hard it was to be a single mother , also stepped in to help with her grandchildren			0
this loving but austere lifestyle might have gone on unbroken if @entity1 had n’t caught the eye of a talent scout in the @entity169 branch of @entity170 nine years ago			2
even as a 15 - year - old schoolgirl , her looks were striking			0
at 5ft 10in tall , she towered over most of her contemporaries at @entity174 in @entity78 and yet as a young teen , she claims to have been self - conscious about her skinny frame			0
‘ i ’d look in the mirror and hate myself			0
i thought i was disgusting , ’ she said a year ago			0
yet it took only moments for the representative from storm , one of the most famous modelling agencies in the world , to see she was a star in the making			2
a meeting at the agency ’s @entity78 offices with her mother resulted in a signed contract			0
a year later , in 2007 , @entity1 made her catwalk debut at @entity191			1
in 2008 , she made headline news at @entity193 when she spoke about the issue of colour in the fashion world , saying : ‘ @entity78 ’s not a white city , so why should our catwalks be so white ? ’ just weeks later , she became the first black woman to model for @entity201 since @entity202 in 1997			1
a few months after that , she was named model of the year at the @entity205			0
and now @entity1 has gone on to achieve what @entity202 , @entity35 ’s first black supermodel , could not , in part because @entity33 invented the models rich list in 2006 after the peak of @entity202 ’s success			1
but back in 2009 , having only just made a name for herself , @entity1 saw her brief modelling career flash before her eyes when she became pregnant			1
the father , @entity91 , a teenager from @entity217 in @entity218 whom she had been dating for several years , was hardly the kind of man to offer a stable future			0
given what her own mother , @entity150 , had gone through as a single mother , @entity1 was worried about breaking the news after taking a pregnancy test in a toilet cubicle at @entity229 en route to @entity69 with her mother and brothers			2
‘ it was the worst plane trip ever			0
it was very emotional telling my mum , very emotional			0
it was one of the hardest things of my life			0
she had me young , she was blaming herself , she was very angry , she was upset			0
’ journey : the father , @entity91 , was arrested and jailed shortly after @entity87 's birth			1
they are no longer together but stay in contact for the sake of their son , while @entity247 fulfills her dream of being a top model @entity1 knew she was a carrier for sickle - cell anaemia , which can have life - threatening complications , and when doctors told her the child had , indeed , inherited the disorder , she was determined to maintain a strong front			1
seven months pregnant in 2009 , she proudly strutted down the catwalk for @entity259 , but later admitted feeling ‘ so guilty and so horrible inside ’			0
the arrest of @entity91 just weeks after @entity87 ’s birth made matters even more stressful			1
in february 2010 , he was jailed for three - and - a - half years for possessing cocaine with intent to supply			2
the pair are no longer together , though 24 - year - old @entity91 ’ mother , @entity267 , told the @entity98 this week that they keep in contact for the sake of their son			1
it was @entity1 ’s mother who came to her rescue , offering to care for the child while she fulfilled her modelling assignments			1
within ten weeks of @entity87 ’s birth , she was back at work , picking up her meteoric career where she had briefly left off			1
she said : ‘ i have seen that doing this can help him and give him a better start in life			2
i ’m doing it for him			0
’ as a young , black woman making her way in an industry dominated by white models , her achievement is remarkable			0
this week when a @entity63 follower pointed out that @entity46 had n’t put an individual black model on its cover since 2002 and called for them to rectify that with @entity1 , the model furiously replied : ‘ so , if @entity46 puts me on the cover now it would be because they were bullied into it , not because i ’m deserving of one			2
’ her appearance on the @entity33 models rich list may well suggest a sea change in attitudes within the fashion industry , but having battled to come so far , @entity1 is clearly determined to be seen as a force in her own right .			1

@entity1 , 24 , fell pregnant at 18 just as she started modelling
weeks after the birth , her lover was jailed for cocaine possession
determined to give son a good life , @entity1 continued to work
she is now one of the world 's top models , she made £ 2.4m last year
