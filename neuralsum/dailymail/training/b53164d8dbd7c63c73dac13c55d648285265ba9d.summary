by @entity1 reporter published : 23:48 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 02:52 est , 9 september 2013 an artificial ‘ nose ’ can sniff out the bacteria that cause blood poisoning			2
the device uses odour - detecting sensors to test for the lethal bugs in 24 hours rather than the usual 72 , a difference that could save many lives			1
researchers hope it will be used to prevent sepsis , a condition that causes the immune system to overreact to infectious bacteria			1
breakthrough : researchers hope that the artificial nose will be used to prevent sepsis which kills an estimated 20 to 35 per cent of sufferers an estimated 20 to 35 per cent of victims of severe sepsis die			1
the device consists of a small plastic bottle that contains a chemical sensing array or ‘ artificial nose ’			2
a blood sample is injected into the bottle , which also contains a nutrient solution that helps bacteria to grow rapidly			2
the growing bacteria release odours that are detected by sensors			0
dots of pigment on the ‘ nose ’ change colour depending on which bacteria are present , alerting doctors to danger			0
it could be used in developing countries , researcher dr @entity43 , of @entity45 ’s @entity44 of @entity46 , said			0
alert : dots of pigment on the ' nose ' change colour depending on which bacteria are present , alerting doctors to danger ( file picture ) he said : ' our @entity59 blood culture bottle can be used almost anywhere in the world for a very low cost and minimal training			0
' all you need is someone to draw a blood sample , an ordinary shaker , incubator , a desktop scanner and a computer			0
' sepsis claims over 37,000 lives in the @entity74 annually - more than lung cancer , and more than breast cancer and bowel cancer combined .			1

the device can detect the lethal bug in 24 hours rather than 72 hours
sepsis kills more than 37,000 in the @entity74 every year - more than lung cancer
