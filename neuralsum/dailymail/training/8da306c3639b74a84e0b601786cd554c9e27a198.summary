the men , who worked on six - figure salaries at the @entity7 in @entity2 , made the video last week in a dripping underground vault surrounded by heavy machinery			1
it begins as all @entity4 videos do , with one mask - wearing member dancing alone , before the film cuts to a group of 15 burly men - many topless - gyrating wildly to the beats of @entity20 's viral hit of the same name			2
@entity4 : the clip begins as all @entity4 videos do , with one mask - wearing member dancing alone at one point , a miner performs the ' caterpillar ' dance move in a muddy puddle as his colleagues cavort around him brandishing orange cones and poles			1
but @entity34 , the firm which owns the mine , unceremoniously relieved the men of their duties for breaching the companies ' core values of safety , integrity and excellence ' , according to a dismissal letter seen by newspaper @entity45			1
one of the sacked workers , who would not be named , accused @entity47 of being too heavy - handed , telling the paper the tradesmen were simply ' having a bit of fun '			1
crazy dance : the film then cuts to a group of 15 burly men - many topless - gyrating wildly to the beats of @entity20 's viral hit , the @entity4 puddle dance : at one point , a miner performs the ' caterpiller ' dance move in a puddle as his colleagues cavort around him breach of values : but @entity34 , the firm which owns the mine , unceremoniously relieved the men of their duties for breaching the companies ' core values of safety , integrity and excellence ' the letter stated that the workers have now not only been barred from the @entity7 mine , but have been blacklisted by @entity47 ' at any site domestically and globally '			1
the sacked @entity78 miners are not the first ' @entity79 ' to land themselves in hot water for performing the rambunctious dance routine and posting it online			1
on friday , dozens of students were charged with violating the @entity84 ’s decency laws after they danced in their underwear to the song outside the headquarters of the north @entity91 nation 's @entity89 president @entity88 in a light - hearted political protest ( pictured )			2
a few days earlier , @entity94 ’s @entity93 threatened to expel students and sack teachers at a school in the country 's capital after they created a version of the meme			0
also last week a group of @entity104 college students were placed under federal investigation after they organised a performance on a @entity108 flight from @entity109 to @entity110			0
it is yet unclear what will happen to them or the air stewards who helped them rally passengers via the on - board intercom to take part			2
earlier this month @entity119 freshman @entity118 was facing expulsion for his attempt to create the largest @entity4 video ever by gathering hundreds of students on a central part of campus to stage the dance			2
a facebook page has since been set up in defence of the miners , sparking furious online debate			1
' an underground mine is no place for cowboys , clowns or fools			0
it ’s an inherently dangerous place to work and workers are entitled to expect those working alongside them to respect the risks and abide by rules and regulations , ' wrote @entity142 on @entity143			0
but @entity144 replied : ' @entity145 work their asses off for up to 4 weeks at a time , away from their family ! ! a bit of fun to pass the time and they get sacked			1
' according to the firm 's website , the @entity152 produces over 160,000 ounces of gold a year			0
it says most low - level workmen typically operate on an eight - days on six - days off rotation , while more senior employees spend seven days below ground before a seven - day furlough			2
as well as its mines in @entity2 , the company also has pits in @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity84			0
up to 4,000 videos of " @entity4 " variations are uploaded on the internet daily			0
the concept is simple - the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to @entity4 by @entity172 @entity20			2
each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them			0
then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild , doing crazy dance moves around the room			0
the song belongs to the trap genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine			0
many of the performers wear facemasks or helmets , strange costumes and fancy dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear			0
middle of nowhere : the 15 men all worked on six - figure salaries at the @entity7 in @entity2			1
