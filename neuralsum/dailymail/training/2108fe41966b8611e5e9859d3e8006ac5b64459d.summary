by @entity0 published : 09:51 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 11 october 2012 scientists have produced the first three dimensional map of the surface beneath @entity5 sea ice , helping them better understand the impact of climate change on @entity8			1
the team of scientists from eight countries have used a robot submarine to chart a frozen and inverted world of mountains and valleys , allowing accurate measurements of the crucial thickness of @entity5 sea ice			1
by combining the data with airborne measures of surface ice and snow , scientists can now accurately measure changes in ice thickness and better understand the affects of global warming			0
an early version of the @entity28 map ' the ice thickness is regarded amongst climate scientists as the holy grail of determining changes in the system , ' @entity5 marine glaciologist @entity29 told @entity35			1
' if we can determine the change in the thickness of the sea ice we can estimate the rate of change that is due to global warming			2
' scientists have ice thickness data for the @entity46 region dating back to the 1950s , allowing for analysis of changes in the @entity46 , but similar data has been unavailable for the ice around the frozen @entity52 continent			0
@entity29 , who is aboard an @entity54 icebreaker in @entity5 waters , is part of the @entity58 project , involving scientists from @entity54 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and the @entity66			2
a free - swimming robot submarine , manoeuvres beneath sea ice in @entity8 to collect data for the @entity28 map the robot was carried aboard the @entity73 's icebreaker , @entity74 they are using a free - swimming robot submarine , which moves about 20 meters ( 65 feet ) below the ice and travels in a grid pattern , using multi-beam sonar to measure the underside of the ice			1
@entity29 said changes in sea ice thickness affects the formation of cold , salty @entity5 bottom water that drives global ocean currents and is crucial for sea life , from phytoplankton and krill to whales			1
' we can actually get a full 3d image of what we are measuring			0
it 's never been done before and that 's really exciting , ' @entity29 added			0
the results will help set a baseline to establish how climate change affects @entity5 sea ice			1
scientists will also be able to examine how changes to sea ice affect the ecosystem			0
similar tests in 2007 used only airborne equipment and produced only two dimensional maps , which are less accurate			0
the icebreaker @entity74 awaiting the return of the scientific teams and their equipment in the @entity5 .			2

comes as @entity5 ice *levels* are at a *record* high
was created using a *specially* *adapted* robot submarine
will help *researcher* analyse the effect of climate change
