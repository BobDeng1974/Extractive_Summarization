anger : mr @entity1 reacted strongly to the prime minister 's words last year @entity1 has launched an attack on the prime minister for comparing @entity7 commemorations to the @entity8			1
the @entity10 host said the @entity7 should be remembered as a disaster , not ‘ an excuse for a knees - up ’			2
he was referring to a speech in which @entity15 promised a ‘ truly national commemoration ’ to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war in 1914			2
mr @entity15 added that he wanted ‘ a commemoration that , like the @entity8 celebrations this year , says something about who we are as a people ’			1
but mr @entity1 , whose great uncle died in the @entity7 , said : ‘ the commemorations should have almost nothing in common with the @entity8 , which was an excuse for a knees - up in the rain to celebrate the happy fact that our national identity is expressed through a family rather than some politician			1
' personally , i think @entity37 has played a blinder as queen			0
but her dull and dutiful grandfather , @entity40 , recognised that the person who should be commemorated at the end of the @entity7 was n’t him , but the unknown soldier			2
’ he added : ‘ the war was a disaster which brought stress and grief to most families in the land : there were postboys who gave up their jobs because they could n’t face the sight of another mother answering the door and breaking down on receiving the telegram with the awful news their son was dead			0
’ the @entity62 presenter criticised the prime minister ’s language in this week ’s @entity65			1
he said : ‘ our prime minister promised the @entity7 commemoration would be “ like the @entity8 celebrations ”			2
what on earth was he talking about ? ’ ' hazardous ' : mr @entity1 criticised many aspects of mr @entity15 's speech at the @entity75 last year , but mainly the decision to compare remebering the @entity7 to the @entity8 mr @entity1 also disagreed with mr @entity15 ’s description of the @entity78 as ‘ incredible ’			1
he said : ‘ these occasions , when the prime minister escapes from his speech - writers , are hazardous			0
@entity82 : @entity1 launched his attack on @entity15 's language in the upcoming edition of the @entity65 ‘ his address included the cloth - eared ambition to spend lots of public money to make the @entity78 “ even more incredible ”			1
‘ the whole point of the place is its awful credibility			0
’ in his speech , made at the museum last year , mr @entity15 said the centenary would be a ‘ personal priority ’ and promised the museum £ 5million			1
calling for the nation to remember the ‘ extraordinary sacrifice of a generation ’ , he also said the @entity7 helped shape @entity101 by prompting medical and technological advances			0
he said : ‘ for all the profound trauma , the resilience and courage that was shown , the values we hold dear and the lessons we learnt changed our nation and helped to make us who we are today			0
’ mr @entity1 said : ‘ not to recognise that it was one of the most consequential events in our history would just be perverse			2
’ but he added : ‘ a number of distinguished fellow citizens , like the poet laureate @entity116 and the thoughtful musician @entity117 , are worried the events will turn into a “ celebration ” of war			0
only a moron would celebrate war			0
’ mr @entity1 also criticised the use of @entity123 in school history lessons , saying of the @entity126 series : ‘ it ’s great – and moving – comedy			1
