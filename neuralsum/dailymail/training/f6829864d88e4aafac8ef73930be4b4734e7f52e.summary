he made friends with gangland villains in the hope they could help him pay off his massive debts			2
during one incident @entity2 illegally accessed a police database to alter the charge sheet of a suspected drugs baron who had been arrested on suspicion of a £ 495,000 drugs and money laundering racket			1
posing as a prosecution lawyer the crooked constable - based at @entity36 , @entity37 - sent ‘ advice ’ suggesting the investigation against his friend should be shelved or made subject of lesser allegations			0
his scam unravelled after he met with 48 - year - old escort @entity41 who wanted to set up her ex-lover @entity43 after a stormy break - up			2

passing sentence judge @entity97 told his offences represented a ' gross breach of trust			0
' the judge told @entity2 : ' at the time you had 12 years of service and some of that time was as a detective and i am sure for most of that time you would have been an effective police officer who gave reason for your family to be proud of you - especially your father			1
@entity41 paid @entity109 to frame her ex-boyfriend on a trumped up charge			2
she gave him £ 19,000 in cash but got cold feet the following day and called the plan off - before reporting him to police ' your personal life was out of control			1
you made extremely unwise relationships for a police officer			2
' the fact you were crippled by debt meant that when you saw the opportunity of obtaining a large sum of money you did			0
' the scandalous nature of that case is perhaps misleading as i am satisfied that there really never was any intention of planting the shotgun and you did n’t have any corrupt colleagues and anything you said to her was little more than sales patter from nothing more than a corrupt sales person			2
' this is a man who has squandered a successful @entity139 on @entity2 ' you are entirely the author of your own fortune			2
whatever your personal circumstances were , the means you used to relieve yourself of the burden was entirely wrong and criminal			0
' in mitigation , defence lawyer mr @entity145 said : ' he was crippled by debt as a result of repeated financial failure in business			0
' it prevented him from being able to provide fully to the children of which he is a father			0
' his father described his son as becoming vacant , withdrawn and illogical			0
it ’s obvious the defendant was much changed			0
' by the time he came to offer to commit the offence with @entity41 he was overwhelmed by circumstance			0
' it ’s to his credit he never acted on any of the foolish ideas proposed			0
@entity2 , from @entity81 , whose father was also a police officer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice ' he had 12 years of service and in his earlier career he did not begin his service motivated by greed or dishonesty rather than altruism and serving the public where he worked hard and well			1
' this is a man who has squandered a successful future and who will live with the consequences long after custody has expired			0
' after the case assistant chief constable @entity188 of @entity37 said : ' the conduct of former @entity191 fell well short of what is expected of a police officer			0
' police officers , staff and the communities of @entity37 would be appalled by his actions , which detract from the hard work that our officers and staff do on a daily basis			0
' @entity57 expects the very highest standards of all its officers and staff			0
they should be honest and act with integrity and should not compromise or abuse their position			0
