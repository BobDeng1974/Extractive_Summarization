' it is a parent 's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [ but ] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery			0
' however , friends of ms @entity21 described @entity26 as an ' evil , evil man ' while @entity107 herself described his pursuit of her as ' corrupt ' and ' criminal '			1
