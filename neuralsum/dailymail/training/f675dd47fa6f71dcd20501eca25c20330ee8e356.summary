schools found ‘ indoctrinating pupils about gay people ’ will face being closed down under new rules designed to promote ‘ @entity6 values ’ , the government confirmed today			1
the @entity7 insisted it was ‘ nonsense ’ to suggest teachers would have to give lessons on gay rights			2
but a spokesman insisted @entity13 , which has introduced the new rules the wake of the @entity16 plot to radicalise pupils in @entity18 , was right to ensure schools were not breeding grounds for homophobia			1
education secretary @entity22 said any schools found ' indoctrinating ' children against homosexuality faced being closed down a spokesman said : ‘ @entity13 are rightly ensuring that schools do not indoctrinate pupils about gay people - or any other people - being inferior			1
‘ the same goes for schools that do things like make girls sit separately at the back of the class			0
both are practices which go directly against the fundamental @entity6 values of tolerance and respect			1
‘ we believe schools should prepare all pupils for life in modern @entity6			2
a broad and balanced curriculum is vital for this			0
’ but the spokesman said it was ' nonsense ' to say children would be taught gay rights			1
@entity51 's shadow education secretary @entity50 said mrs @entity52 ' clearly does not believe that lgbt rights are @entity6 values '			1
he said : ‘ compulsory sex and relationship education , including lgbt rights , in all schools is common sense , not nonsense			0
‘ @entity22 should apologise for the offence that has been caused by claiming that it is nonsense for all schools to teach gay rights			1
’ it came after the education secretary @entity22 – who said last week that she had changed her mind about gay marriage after voting against its introduction – warned schools not to ‘ close minds ’			0
she told the @entity71 that schools must teach ‘ pupils to respect other people even if they do not agree with them ’			0
@entity13 chief sir @entity75 will mark down any schools which do not ' actively promote ' @entity6 values mrs @entity52 said : ‘ i should have thought this is a principle with which the vast majority of people would agree			1
all schools of whatever type have a duty to protect young people and to ensure they leave school fully prepared for life in modern @entity6			0
‘ these values — democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty , and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs — are not new			0
the requirement to “ actively promote ” them is designed to reinforce the importance this government attaches to these values			2
’ schools have been warned that those that fail to follow new rules on @entity6 values will be judged inadequate and could face closure by @entity13 inspectors			1
the move follows snap inspections by @entity13 at 40 schools , including those for @entity110 and @entity111 pupils			0
they were launched in the wake of the @entity115 affair in @entity18 as part of the government ’s efforts to combat extremism			0
mrs @entity52 is backing @entity13 chief sir @entity75 who will say that any school suspected of not teaching a broad and balanced curriculum , of rapidly falling standards or of not preparing children for life in modern @entity6 will face no - notice inspections			2
for the first time the rules give inspectors the powers to downgrade schools where teachers are breaching the @entity132 , which encourages respect for lesbian , gay and transgender people as well as those of other religions and races .			0
