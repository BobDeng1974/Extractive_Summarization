@entity1 's perfect start to @entity3 qualifying came crashing down in @entity4 after @entity5 ended their brave resistance with a second - half brace			1
despite taking maximum points from their first three matches , including away wins in @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity10 's men were under siege for the entirety of the encounter			1
yet their backs - to - the - wall defence looked as though it would yield a vital draw until right - back @entity5 struck in the 74th and 79th minutes to seal a 2 - 0 win for the new @entity26 leaders			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity5 scored two late goals as @entity4 beat @entity1 in their @entity26 qualifier in @entity30 @entity4 : @entity31 , @entity5 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 81 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 ( @entity41 58 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 46 )			1

att : 40,000 ref : @entity78 ( @entity79 )			0
the result was well deserved for the hosts , who also hit the crossbar , missed a sitter from point - blank range and had a convincing penalty appeal turned down , but @entity1 will still feel disappointed			1
they put in a monstrous defensive effort at the @entity89 , led by captain for the night @entity58 and assisted by tireless shifts from @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity92			0
@entity67 , having scored in his previous three matches , also ran himself to a standstill in an isolated forward role			1
the first half was a story of relentless , yet ultimately fruitless , one - way traffic			0
from kick - off @entity4 punted the ball towards left - back @entity57 , the first in a series of attacks aimed down the flanks			1
@entity57 and right - back @entity56 both ply their trade in @entity108 , with @entity109 and @entity110 respectively , and there was a concerted attempt to expose them			0
there were few breaks for the back line either , with @entity67 alone up front and unable to hold up possession for any length of time			0
it still took 15 minutes for @entity4 to test @entity55 , out - of - favour @entity122 defender @entity32 producing a nimble bicycle kick that the @entity125 stopper gathered at the second attempt			1
the visitors ' first chance followed almost immediately , @entity67 burrowing into the box before @entity61 slid a low shot just wide of the far post			0
@entity4 went again and should have scored when @entity39 spurned a glorious double chance in the 17th minute			1
he looked certain to convert a perfect cross from six yards but his crisp volley rebounded off the underside of the crossbar			0
@entity5 's double saw @entity4 hit top spot in @entity26 as they knocked @entity1 into second place @entity5 opens the scoring in the 74th minute as @entity1 goalkeeper @entity55 watches the ball hit the back of the net @entity5 's first goal in the 74th minute finally broke down @entity1 's resistance in @entity30 the ball then bounced over a disorientated @entity55 and fell invitingly for a second attempt , but this time @entity39 headed gently back to the grateful keeper			1
@entity60 and @entity58 were fighting fires in the centre , clearing , intercepting and heading away a raft of crosses and through balls , while @entity65 was struggling to cover @entity56 on the right			0
@entity155 has been fancifully likened to the great @entity156 but a wonderful run in the 32nd minute only improved the 34 - year - old 's credentials			2
collecting the ball just inside the opposition half he charged past @entity62 and made his way to the edge of the area where he weaved his way past @entity58 and @entity56 before cutting the ball across goal for @entity42 to slot home			0
@entity4 players bundle on top of @entity5 in celebration of his second goal in the 79th minute @entity61 ( left ) , @entity67 ( centre ) and @entity92 ( right ) look on dejected after @entity1 were undone @entity1 manager @entity10 saw his side lose their first qualifier but the striker lost his footing at the crucial moment , fluffing his connection completely from five yards and allowing @entity59 to mop up			1
goal threat at the other end was virtually non-existent but the willing @entity67 did serve a warning just before the break , muscling through on the left and working @entity31 at his near post			0
@entity42 paid the price for his earlier miss , hooked at half - time in favour of @entity192			0
@entity192 had been on the field seven minutes when his measured pass put the overlapping @entity34 one on one with @entity55			0
he attempted a delicate chipped finish but @entity55 guessed right , standing tall and smothering the shot with his chest			0
@entity199 should have won a penalty just after the hour , dribbling into the area again and tumbling to the floor after @entity57 left his foot out			2
but the referee was unimpressed or unsighted and play moved on			0
@entity10 attempted to shore things up by replacing @entity65 with the defensively minded @entity66 , but the resistance finally came to an end 16 minutes from time			1
@entity34 played provider , whipping in an awkward cross from left wing that @entity58 could only fling a trailing leg at			0
the ball landed nicely for @entity5 and he left @entity55 no chance from 10 yards			0
that knocked the stuffing from @entity1 and it was no surprise to see a second goal five minutes later , @entity5 again arriving in the right place to nod home @entity199 's cross at the far post			1
there was no coming back now , with @entity63 's late arrival as a second striker merely window dressing			2
@entity67 applauds @entity1 's contingent of travelling supporters after their loss in @entity30 @entity230 supporters packed into the away section at @entity89 to support their team in the @entity234 qualifier			1

@entity237 defender scored twice to send @entity4 top of @entity26
@entity1 had won all three of their previous games in @entity3 qualification
@entity10 's side second behind @entity4 in @entity26 after defeat
