voters could be forced to show their passport or driving licence to help prevent fraud photographic @entity6 should be made compulsory in polling stations across the country , @entity5 ’s elections watchdog warns today			1
the @entity9 says the rest of the @entity11 should follow the lead of @entity13 , where voters have long been required to prove their identity before they can cast their ballot			1
the watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so - called ‘ personation ’ fraud , where an individual pretends to be someone else in order to use their vote			1
it calls for a change in the law to ensure the new system is introduced by 2019 ‘ at the latest ’			1
but sources close to the deputy prime minister @entity31 , who is in charge of electoral reform , last night said he was against the idea as it risked creating a system of @entity6 cards by the back door			2
speaking in the @entity39 yesterday , mr @entity31 rejected a call from @entity42 mp @entity41 to introduce voter identification cards			0
he said the introduction of individual voter registration - which requires voters to provide details such as their date of birth and @entity53 numbers - would ‘ stamp out the problems of fraud ’			1
a source said : ‘ we do n’t believe that to vote in this country you should need an id card			0
we are part of a government that scrapped @entity6 cards - this is slightly different , but it is not a million miles off			0
’ individual voter registration replaces the traditional system where the head of the household was responsible for registering all members of the household			2
but the @entity9 warns that by tightening up on postal ballot fraud , the new system could make @entity5 ‘ more vulnerable ’ to personation fraud			1
‘ polling station voting in @entity5 remains vulnerable to personation fraud because there are currently few checks available to prevent someone claiming to be an elector and voting in their name , ’ the report says			1
the watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so - called ¿ personation ¿ fraud at polling stations ‘ this part of the system could become more vulnerable to fraud as other processes ( including electoral registration and postal or proxy voting ) become more secure			1
’ the watchdog says voters should be required to show their passport or driving licence at the polling station before they are permitted to vote			2
those without either document would be eligible for a free ‘ electoral identity card ’			2
@entity99 , an electoral expert at the @entity100 , said introducing @entity6 requirements would lead to lower turnout , with many voters not wanting the hassle			0
dr @entity99 said : ‘ requirements to produce passports and other forms of identification may sound reasonable enough , but they will have unintended consequences			0
' they stop people voting			0
you decide to vote on the way back from work			0
but after a busy day you realise that you forgot your passport			0
what do you do ? @entity118 back home , collect your passport and then vote ? the answer for many citizens would be head home and stay there			0
that extra time is the difference between voting and not voting			0
’ dr @entity99 said more evidence was needed about the extent of electoral fraud before such a major change is made			1
the @entity9 said there was little evidence that introducing voter @entity6 reduced turnout .			2

@entity9 says rest of @entity11 should follow @entity13
the watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so - called ‘ personation ’ fraud
