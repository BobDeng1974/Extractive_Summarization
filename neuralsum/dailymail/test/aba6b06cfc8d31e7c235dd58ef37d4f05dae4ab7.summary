@entity0 has revealed a secret			1
despite what appeared cast - iron evidence to the contrary , he does not practise free - kicks			1
he has taken only a handful in his career			2
yet with seven minutes to go in a game @entity8 dared not lose , he stepped forward , pushing aside team - mates , to curl his dead - ball opportunity over the @entity13 wall and into the net			1
‘ i surprised myself ! ’ he says , laughing			2
‘ when i saw it , @entity16 said , “ i want to shoot ”			2
but i said , “ i want to take it ”			2
@entity0 bends a free - kick over the @entity13 wall to rescue a point for @entity8 last week @entity0 jumps for joy after sealing his hat - trick in the relegation battle with @entity13 at @entity26 the @entity28 striker admitted he even surprised himself by finding the back of the net with the free kick ‘ it was n’t about the hat - trick , it was more about if i can take the free - kick or not , if i can hit the target			1
i have only taken one before for @entity8 , against @entity37 , and i hit the post			1
’ what happens should a chance come from similar range against @entity42 ? ‘ i ’ll take it			1
sometimes you have to try			2
’ @entity45 speaks a striker of soaring confidence			2
eight goals in his last six games , the latest a towering header to take all three points at @entity52 , @entity0 is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an @entity56 semi-final			1
sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at @entity8 ’s @entity60 training complex , he looks as if he would like to be on @entity62 ’s turf post-haste			1
he has been rejuvenated under @entity63 , scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new @entity8 manager took over			1
the unnerving thing for @entity42 is that he says he will get better			1
@entity0 rises above @entity67 to head the winning goal for @entity8 against @entity52 on saturday @entity0 points to the sky in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches @entity0 is in the kind of form which could see @entity63 's @entity8 escape from @entity77 relegation ‘ i still think i can do more , in everything , ’ he insists			1
‘ i ca n’t say i ’m happy to be there now , i want to do more and more			2
’ that insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year , starved first of football , then chances			2
it was april 3 , 2014 , when a loud crack was heard across @entity60 ’s training pitches signalling @entity0 ’s ruptured achilles			1
his @entity88 dream was over			1
parents @entity89 and @entity90 cancelled their tickets to @entity93			2
six months of rehabilitation followed before @entity0 ’s return last october			1
a red card on his third start against @entity52 kept him out for another brief period			2
there was a splendid goal at @entity101 , then another against @entity102			2
a third came against @entity104 in the @entity56 third round			1
dazzlingly good , but these strikes were isolated			0
@entity0 never appeared his barnstorming self			1
his movement was limited , his impact negligible			0
@entity8 ’s safety - first style was a significant factor			1
@entity113 looked cut adrift up front			0
the nadir came when @entity116 dropped him to the bench for the visit of @entity120 in february			0
‘ it was frustrating because i knew i could do better , ’ he says , reflecting on that moment			0
‘ every time after the game i said to myself , “ i can do better ”			0
it was frustrating to play a game with no chances			0
but i am not that guy who is going to complain			0
’ @entity63 ’s impact has been immediate			1
just as he did with @entity131 at @entity52 , he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting			2
@entity63 ’s tactics are tailored to @entity0 and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast			1
@entity0 was forced to watch @entity28 reach the quarter - final of the @entity88 after rupturing his achilles @entity0 praised the impact of new manager @entity63 for playing a style that suits the striker 's attributes ‘ he has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me , ’ explains @entity0			1
‘ when a manager says that , you feel more important , more responsible			2
‘ the way that we play now is comfortable for me because i ’m scoring and also for the team because i help the team			0
’ he is excited about his partnership with @entity153			0
‘ he helps me destroy the defenders			0
with two we ’re always better than one			0
’ @entity0 is grateful to @entity116 for bringing him to @entity8 from @entity157 in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager			1
‘ that ’s a tough question , ’ he pauses			0
‘ i will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up			0
’ @entity0 believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition			1
‘ i play like i used to before			0
’ those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation ’s @entity88 adventure on tv are becoming a distant , if difficult , memory			1
@entity0 is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker @entity153 the striker paid tribute to former manager @entity116 for signing him from @entity157 in 2012 ‘ it was tough , ’ he says			1
‘ i worked hard for that opportunity			0
the manager @entity181 said , “ if you want , you can come with the lads			2
” but i did n’t			0
i came back to @entity28 and my family helped get me through			1
my mum said , “ you have to be thankful to @entity187 , it could have been worse ”			0
’ becoming a father to baby @entity189 last september put things in perspective			0
‘ it was good , i forgot about my injury , ’ he says , smiling			2
doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before			0
three years ago @entity157 dismissed his @entity77 credentials			2
‘ they said i was n’t ready because the level between @entity28 and @entity201 is really high and i should stay one more season			1
but i said , “ no , i am confident , i want to go ”			0
i do n’t really listen to what people say			0
if i feel it , i just do it			0
but @entity0 concedes that sacking @entity116 was the correct decision after the lift @entity63 has given them @entity120 midfielder and compatriot @entity210 tweeted his admiration for @entity0 after his @entity52 winner ‘ it was my dream to play in the best league			1
i was a fan of @entity216			0
’ he insists he is not dreaming of scoring at @entity62			1
‘ i do n’t want a dream , i want to do it			0
’ he is not that close to compatriot @entity220 but is good friends with @entity222 and @entity210			0
‘ i have known them since i was really young			0
’ @entity210 tweeted his admiration following @entity0 ’s goal at @entity52			1
‘ he is my brother , like you say			0
for me , he deserves to be the @entity227			0
’ @entity0 will consider what he deserves in the summer			1
@entity229 have been keeping tabs on him			0
‘ since i came i have had a lot of pressure here , ’ he says			0
‘ if i want to one day , after say four or five years , be with the big club , then it is pressure every time also			0
’ he ultimately wants @entity237 football			0
that will come for @entity8 by reaching the final , should @entity216 also qualify			1
‘ i think this is the beauty of the @entity56 , now everything is possible , ’ he says .			1
