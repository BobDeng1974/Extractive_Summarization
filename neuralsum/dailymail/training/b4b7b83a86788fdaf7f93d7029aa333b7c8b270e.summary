a disturbing racist video has emerged of three girls aged between five and seven singing ' if you all hate p * * * * clap your hands ' to the tune of a popular children 's song			1
the three blonde children are shown sitting in a circle clapping their hands while singing the hate chant for the amusement of an adult filming them			1
during the racist song a toddler boy wanders around the room while the little girls sing the offensive phrase to the tune of ' if you 're happy and you know it clap your hands '			1
the video , believed to have been produced in the @entity27 area since the @entity28 , has sparked outrage online and among anti-racism charities			1
the clip - which is being circulated via @entity46 and @entity47 - has provoked an angry response online			2
writing on @entity46 , @entity49 said : ' i actually ca n't believe that ! ! ! ' if you all hate the p * * * * clap your hands ' racism taken to the next level			1
' @entity58 added : ' that video of 3 little kids singing ' if you all hate the p * * * * clap your hands ' is so upsetting			1
' @entity65 wrote : ' i 'm so baffled			0
a nursery rhyme turned into a racist chants by little kids			2
' anti-racism charities have blamed the parents for warping their children 's minds			1
one appalled man who saw the footage online said : ' it 's disgusting			2
i could n't believe it when i saw it			0
' of course you ca n't blame the girls - they 've been taught this by people much older than them			0
' it shows a whole new level of racism			0
how can we expect them to grow into tolerant and respectful adults , if they are being taught songs like this at such a young age ? ' the 13 second clip is understood to have been filmed in a living room in the @entity27 area in 2015			1
the three little girls sit in a smart - looking carpeted living room with a large leather sofa			2
it has been slammed by anti-racism educational charity @entity98 , who use football to stamp out intolerance in the wider society			2
a spokesman for the charity said : ' the fact these young people are using such an offensive term so freely openly shows a lack of understanding about the nature of the term from their guardians			0
' the fact young people are using this word does n't come as a surprise given a study from @entity118 found a quarter of people believe calling a @entity122 person a paki was acceptable			0
' blurred : the identities of the children are not known , and have been obscured by @entity126 , but they are known to be between the ages of five and seven @entity128 ( @entity129 ) said the video ' fostered hatred and fuelled divide ' and the children had been ' manipulated ' by adults			1
interim director @entity135 said : ' social media can be a tool that tackles inequalities and promotes human rights , tolerance and respect or as in this case can foster hatred and fuel divide			0
' aside from this potentially breaching the law by inciting racial hatred , what is particularly upsetting about this film is the abuse of young minds - children are not born racist - they are taught			1
' here we see this in action			0
this is a form of child exploitation			0
' these children have been manipulated by adults who have taken advantage of their innocence and then disseminated them on film to the wider public - have they had a say in this ? ' this can label them in the longer term			1
' children are like mirrors and they reflect the culture in which they live and are captive to their parents ' viewpoints			2
' in a week where we have seen events that show both the value we all place on freedom of speech , and at the same time how people can be indoctrinated and manipulated to perpetrate atrocities - here we may believe this is simply freedom of expression albeit unpalatable to many - but actually this is nothing short evidence of indoctrination on film			0
' moreover , whose freedom of speech is this ? these children had no say in this			0
' for @entity129 , films like can be also very distressing to the members of our community that these children have unwittingly maligned			0
