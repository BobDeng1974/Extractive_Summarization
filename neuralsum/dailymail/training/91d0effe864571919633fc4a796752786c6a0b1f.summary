the @entity2 regions will be given extra powers as a domino effect if @entity6 votes to remain in the @entity7 , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the move would also affect @entity9 and @entity10 and would result in a ‘ much needed rewiring ’ of how the @entity7 is governed			1
mr @entity0 described @entity2 as an ‘ unusually over-centralised country ’ and said the changes that would occur in the next parliament were the ‘ missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle ’			1
devolution in @entity6 was an irreversible process and would have knock - on effects for the rest of the @entity7 , particularly the @entity2 regions , which would be given greater powers over tax and spending			1
‘ i think it will signal a much wider rewiring of the governance and constitutional arrangements in the country as a whole , particularly governance within @entity2 which remains an unusually over-centralised country , ’ mr @entity0 told the @entity36 political and constitutional reform select committee			1
when @entity6 is granted further powers over taxation , welfare and borrowing ‘ that will signal a wider debate about how we can rewire and decentralise the @entity7 state … that ’s the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle ’ , he said			1
former prime minister @entity54 has set out his proposed schedule for new powers to be transferred to @entity57 , saying work on it would start immediately after the referendum			1
former prime minister @entity54 has set out his proposed schedule for new powers to be transferred to @entity57 , saying work on it would start immediately after the referendum @entity63 , the conservatives and the @entity64 joined together in @entity65 yesterday to promise more devolution in the event of a no vote			1
but there was continued confusion as to what powers would be devolved , as the three parties have each separately published differing proposals			1
@entity6 conservative leader @entity75 said the parties ’ devolution proposals have ‘ broad themes ’ in common and that voting no would allow the parties to mould them into a single offering			1
but @entity81 said it showed the no campaign had ‘ fallen apart at the seams ’			1
the first minister said : ‘ we now know after all of the hype of the last 48 hours they realised that the ground was shifting under their feet			1
but actually , nothing is new in this package			1
it ’s nothing approaching the powers that @entity6 needs to create jobs , to save the health service and build a better society			2
’ @entity99 , @entity64 mp for @entity100 , made an early plea yesterday for his county to be ‘ next in line ’ for devolved powers			2
mr @entity0 admitted the @entity26 announcement this week was about ‘ timetable and process ’ not the substance of the powers – saying doing so would violate referendum campaign rules			1
he defended the government against claims it blundered by not offering a @entity26 option on the ballot paper			1
‘ when you have a referendum it ’s very important you have clarity and certainty about what the choice is			2
that ’s why you only devolve powers after a decision has been made by the @entity6 people that @entity6 will be part of the @entity7			2
’ scots get home rule , @entity2 pays bill the @entity6 have been promised an array of new powers if they vote to stay in the @entity7			1
@entity132 examines the likely consequences			2
what extra tax - raising powers will the @entity6 get ? while the final details are still being hammered out , the prominent role taken by @entity54 suggests @entity63 ’s blueprint will be at the forefront			2
this would allow @entity140 to vary @entity142 ’s income tax rate by up to 15p in the pound , giving them the option of raising the higher rate threshold , and restoring the punitive 50p rate for top earners			2
there would be no new powers over corporation tax , national insurance , vat or capital gains tax			2
the @entity154 say the tax - free personal income tax allowance should remain reserved to @entity142			0
under @entity64 proposals the @entity6 would raise and spend most of their own taxes and borrow on their own terms			0
@entity81 , pictured with @entity159 in 2012 signing the referendum agreement , has been peddling the myth that @entity6 should vote @entity162 to protect the @entity163 , but it is already run entirely by the administration how will the money be collected ? as now , all income tax will be paid into the @entity7 treasury before being passed on to @entity6 in the form of a grant			0
in future , if @entity57 decides to increase – or decrease – taxes on @entity6 the @entity170 will adjust their bills accordingly and pass the appropriate sum on to @entity6			0
will @entity6 ’s benefits regime be more generous ? yes , if that ’s how @entity57 chooses to spend the money			0
under @entity63 ’s plan , control of housing benefit – which costs £ 1.7billion in @entity6 – would be devolved , so it ’s expected the so - called bedroom tax would immediately be axed , at a cost of £ 50million			0
@entity183 , paid to disabled or infirm @entity184 , will also be devolved			0
it ’s feared that , armed with the new tax powers , the left - wing @entity186 would hammer middle and higher earners with tax rises			0
can @entity6 expect a better - funded @entity163 ? @entity186 leader @entity81 has been peddling the myth that @entity6 should vote @entity162 to protect the @entity163 : in fact , it is already run entirely by the devolved administration			0
however , should @entity6 wish to devote more money to fund the @entity196 , they would be free to do so using their new tax - raising powers			0
who will pick up the lion ’s share of @entity6 ’s benefits bill ? the @entity7 as a whole would remain on the hook for the most expensive , big ticket welfare spending			0
this includes the state pension , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , maternity pay , and bereavement benefits			0
will the @entity6 continue to get a better deal than the @entity2 ? @entity63 says it would keep the controversial @entity213 formula , with only minor adjustments			1
currently , it gives @entity6 £ 1,364 per head more spending than the @entity7 average			0
while no party has spelled it out , it appears certain that @entity6 would continue to be free to spend more overall than it receives in taxes			0
are n’t @entity6 already getting extra powers ? yes			0
the @entity222 – intended to spike mr @entity81 ’s guns , ahead of the referendum – guarantees the largest transfer of financial powers in 300 years			0
this includes a new @entity6 rate of income tax – which may be varied by 10p in the pound			0
income tax can already be varied 3p , but this power has never been used .			0

deputy prime minister described @entity2 as ' unusually over-centralised '
believes proposed changes will be the ' missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle '
added that sudden announcement of ' @entity26 ' was not a panicked move
