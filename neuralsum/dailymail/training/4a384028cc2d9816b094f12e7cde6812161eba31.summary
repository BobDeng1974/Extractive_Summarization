with paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot , these eerie photographs provide a fascinating insight inside an abandoned mental hospital			1
@entity6 in @entity7 was known for its electric shock treatment - and rife with stories about inmates committing suicide in their padded cells			1
these pictures were captured by student @entity14 , 22 , after he visited the now - derelict hospital to get a closer look of what remained inside			1
but the centre - made even more unsettling now with its peeling paint - was very much an asylum impressive sight : people are ' amazed by what 's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily ' , said mr @entity14 falling apart : the series of buildings were erected more than 150 years ago , and has been derelict for almost a quarter of a century from the outside : the hospital sits in 120 acres of gardens and farmland			1
it sounds idyllic but - for its residents - the truth was often a lot more painful he said : ‘ a once busy hospital has now fallen silent and empty			2
the spaces that are left behind are huge , amazing and unique - hidden away			2
‘ every derelict place i visit has its own uniqueness and atmosphere which you can sense when walking around			2
i try to give off that feeling in my images			0
‘ the people i show are amazed by what 's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily whilst on their travels			0
’ built in 1852 , the grounds of @entity6 had their own burial site for those who never escaped from the building			1
mr @entity14 added : ‘ i also like to try and convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin			2
if walls could talk : administration of the hospital passed to the @entity86 in 1948 and , by the early 1960s , the name ' asylum ' had been sanitised from its title			1
but there is a haunting sense of history when visiting the site overgrown : mr @entity14 captured some extraordinary photographs , saying that the ' once - busy hospital has now fallen silent and empty ' butterflies and flowers : with paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot , this photograph provides a poignant image of at least a superficial attempt to brighten patients ' days open doors : mr @entity14 said he attempts in his work to ' convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin ' beyond redemption : the @entity28 's sight is now a sorry sight , and there are now firm plans to bring the buildings back to their former glory unique architecture : even though the buildings are in a sad state of disrepair , @entity14 said they were still more impressive than the ' bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities ' escape ... but no escape : fire exit doors , in various states of decay , would have provided patients with a temporary respite from the asylum - and only in an emergency metaphor : the soothing floral - pattern wallpaper in this room has peeled away to reveal the impenetrable brick wall behind ‘ this is especially important to capture as nowadays you have bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities			1
‘ the buildings built in the previous century are a thing of the past			0
’ the hospital has been derelict since 1990 and was set in grounds of 120 acres of gardens and farmland			1
administration of the hospital passed to the @entity86 in 1948 and by the early 1960s it was known by its final name of @entity38			1
a plan to transform the hospital into more than 200 homes was approved by the local council in @entity151 in april			0
property development firm @entity152 hopes to turn the @entity155 - listed building into 64 houses and 42 apartments , according to reports			0
a large number of asylums were built across @entity161 in the second half of 19th century to house the mentally ill in @entity164 society			0
doctors believed that mental health issues were primarily a physical disorder of the brain - and therefore needed physical treatment			2
one of their treatments at that time involved giving the patient a shock from a @entity175 jar - a device for storing electric charge			1
another method was said to have been insulating the patient , electrifying them and then drawing sparks from the affected part			0
one doctor from the @entity184 wrote in 1873 of a 26 - year - old female patient with melancholia who ' endeavoured in every way to destroy herself '			0
according to an article in the @entity192 in 1988 , dr @entity190 said : ' electricity was applied 26 times , positive pole to bead , negative to band			0
at first , she could only bear a very few cells , six or eight , and it seemed to make her head ache - however , she was afterwards able to bear more			0
he added that the results were ‘ very satisfactory ’ , saying that she was ‘ much brighter , converses rationally ' and ' has no desire for self - destruction ’ .			0
