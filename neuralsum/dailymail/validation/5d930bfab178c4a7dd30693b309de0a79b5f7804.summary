the @entity0 are set to decide @entity2 ’s fate today after the @entity4 defender denied allegations of spitting at @entity7 striker @entity6			1
a disciplinary hearing was hastily set up last night after @entity2 confirmed his intention to fight the charge which will carry a six - game ban if he is found guilty			1
the @entity0 wanted to make sure the matter was dealt with swiftly before the @entity13 international played in @entity4 ’s @entity16 quarter - final clash with @entity17 at @entity18 on monday night			1
@entity2 has decided to contest the @entity0 charge of spitting on @entity7 forward @entity6 @entity2 appears to launch spit in the direction of the @entity7 striker , who then retaliates @entity2 and @entity6 clash near the half - way line at @entity25 following the unpleasant exchange @entity17 ( h ) , monday ; @entity28 ( h ) , march 15 ; @entity30 ( a ) , march 22 ; @entity31 ( h ) , april 4 ; @entity33 ( h ) april 12 ; @entity35 ( a ) april 18			1
they tweeted confirmation of @entity2 ’s decision on friday , just over an hour after the 6pm deadline he had been given to respond to the charge			1
it read : ‘ @entity4 ’s @entity2 denies @entity0 charge in relation to incident involving @entity6			1
@entity46 hearing tonight , decision expected tomorrow			2
’ it is understood that @entity4 will submit video evidence to support @entity2 ’s claim that he did not spit directly at @entity51			2
both players were charged over the unsavoury incident in @entity4 ’s 1 - 0 win at @entity25 on wednesday night			2
@entity6 issued a public apology and accepted his guilt , triggering an immediate seven - match ban			1
the @entity60 striker ’s suspension is one game longer because he had already served a three - match ban earlier this season			1
@entity2 was expected to contest the charge after issuing a statement on thursday denying any knowledge of a spitting incident , which followed a tackle between the two players in the first half			1
he said : ‘ having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night ’s match			2
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at @entity6			2
‘ i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor			0
@entity6 has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the @entity0 on thursday tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from @entity7 and @entity4 gather on the pitch @entity6 was banned for an extra game after being sent off for elbowing @entity88 in december ‘ during the game @entity6 and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting			1
‘ it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do			0
it is certainly not something that i did last night			0
’ @entity4 boss @entity102 also defended his player , insisting that he believed @entity2 ’s version of events			2
spitting is understandably reviled among the majority of @entity109 players , but @entity111 striker @entity110 mounted a surprisingly robust objection on friday by threatening to leave any opponent who targeted him in such a manner ‘ eating through a straw ’			0
the @entity0 are unlikely to take any action against @entity110 but will not welcome any talk of physical violence on the pitch			0
@entity110 told @entity121 : ‘ as a player you take anything off the ball ; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up			0
little things like that go on in any match			0
‘ but spitting is pretty low			0
if it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then i think he ’d be eating his supper through a straw that night			0
i would n’t be that happy			0
it ’s the lowest of the low			0
