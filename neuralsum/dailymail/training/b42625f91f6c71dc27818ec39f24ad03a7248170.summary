by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:14 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 3 april 2013 a shocking new revelation has been uncovered in the infamous 31 - year - old mystery surrounding the death of @entity6 actress @entity5			1
@entity5 's body was found floating in the sea off @entity9 , @entity10 on nov 29 , 1981			1
she had been staying on the yacht , the @entity13 , along with husband @entity14 and their guest and fellow actor @entity15			1
the new discovery is the latest in a series of revelations in the case over the past couple of years			0
refusal : @entity14 ( left ) has refused requests by detectives to be interviewed as part of a fresh investigation into the death of his wife @entity5 ( right ) in 1981 @entity15 was a guest of @entity31 and @entity14 on their yacht on the night that she drowned authorities reopened the case in 2011 after the captain of the yacht , @entity39 , claimed he had originally lied to the authorities and a new coroner 's report published in january revealed that @entity5 sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body before she went overboard and drowned			1
now the @entity47 claims to have uncovered documentation - an official lifeguard log - which suggests @entity14 and @entity15 had engaged in a sexual act and that @entity5 may have walked in on them and set off the chain of events which lead to her untimely and still unexplained death			1
the note , which is torn and illegible in parts , reads ' also known @entity15 and @entity14 were engaged in sexual activity in cab of boat ... ( illegible ) ... that ms @entity61 found both of them together ( illegible ) ... stated they took her away in a ( illegible ) ... was the last time she was seen alive			1
' the @entity66 lifeguard , who worked with detectives on the case , told the enquirer he made the notes on the log after detectives told him that it was a scenario that were considering as a possible motive for any crime that might have been committed on the boat			0
party : ms @entity5 , mr @entity14 and actor @entity15 were aboard the boat - along with captain @entity39 ( right ) when she disappeared and drowned if legitimate , the documentation could help shed further light on the case which is remains a mystery 21 years after the tragedy occurred			1
ms @entity61 death was initially ruled an accidental drowning , caused by her slipping and falling from the dinghy , but authorities reopened the case in 2011			2
@entity39 , who said he had originally lied to authorities , now claims @entity61 and @entity14 had been fighting in the hours before her body was found			2
neither @entity14 nor @entity15 has ever been charged in connection with the case			1
in january a new coroner 's report revealed that bruises found on the actress ' face , wrists , knees , and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not , as the 1981 report had concluded , as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side			1
those bruises could have been ' non-accidental ' and she could have been assaulted aboard the yacht , the medical examiner claimed			0
beaten : ms @entity5 , seen here in 1962 , had bruises on her wrists , knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten , according to a new coroner 's report released in january the new coroner 's report poked numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death has been accidental - however it stopped short of calling her death a homicide			1
@entity14 's publicist , @entity122 , told @entity123 in january that he would not comment on the report			1
@entity126 's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that @entity5 's husband , @entity14 , was with her right up until she went overboard			1
her death was ruled ' accidental ' at the time , but in 2012 , the coroner changed the ruling to ' undetermined			1
' the coroner 's office said in the new report that it is not have enough evidence to rule on the manner in which @entity5 died			1
however , the report did pay special attention to the bruises found on @entity5 's body			1
' the location of the bruises , the multiplicity of the bruises , lack of head trauma , or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water , ' the report stated			0
fatal : this is the yacht splendor that ms @entity5 and mr @entity14 were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off @entity9 over @entity154 weekend in 1981 dangerous : ms @entity5 reportedly could not swim			1
her body was found floating in the water near @entity9 hours after she went overboard tragic : new information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that ms @entity5 's death was accidental ( pictured here with mr @entity14 ) confession : @entity39 , the skipper of the yacht , says he lied to police about what happened the night @entity5 drowned ' since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation , it is opined by this @entity166 that the manner of death should be left as undetermined , ' chief medical examiner dr. @entity166 wrote in the report completed last june			1
@entity14 has told investigators that @entity5 , who could not swim , must have fallen in the water when she got up to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the yacht			2
he is not considered a suspect by the @entity126			0
@entity5 's body was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.14 percent , nearly twice the legal limit for driving			2
she was also found to be under the influence of a motion sickness medication and a painkiller , which likely increased her level of intoxication			0
her body was found floating off @entity9 , near @entity66 , several hours later			0
the captain of the yacht , @entity39 , told ' @entity195 ' and the ' today ' show last year that he heard mr @entity14 and ms @entity5 arguing the night of her disappearance and believed mr @entity14 was to blame for her death			1
he said that after @entity5 went to bed , he heard the fight continuing in her cabin , including sounds of a physical struggle			0
he also claimed that a fight had broken out between @entity14 and actor @entity15 , who was also aboard to yacht			2
mr @entity39 claims @entity14 waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities			0
@entity5 , 43 , rose to stardom in 1947 playing little @entity209 , the girl who did n't believe in @entity210 , in ' @entity211			2
' she later starred as @entity213 in 1961 's ' @entity214 ' and was nominated for an @entity215 for her role opposite @entity217 in ' @entity218			0
' @entity14 , now 82 , admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of november 28 , 1981 , but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed			1
he maintains he had nothing to do with her death , though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her			0
however , @entity39 reportedly offered an alternate explanation for @entity5 's death			2
@entity228 , the actress ' young sister , claimed to author @entity230 that @entity39 called her and drunkenly confessed that @entity14 allowed his wife to drown			0
' he said it appeared to him as though ( @entity14 ) shoved her away and she went overboard			0
@entity39 panicked and ( @entity14 ) said , " leave her there			0
" @entity39 said he was very panicky that he was sitting and ( @entity14 ) kept drinking and kept drinking			0
‘ and he ’d say , " come on , let ’s get her			0
" and he said ( @entity14 ) was in such a foul mood , at that point , that he then shut up and was waiting for when , when are they gon na go to her rescue , until all the sound stopped , ’ @entity228 is heard telling @entity230 in recordings make for her 2001 book @entity247 : the biography of @entity5			2
@entity228 continues on to say that @entity39 did not think that @entity14 meant for @entity5 to die but he did not ‘ run to her aid			2
’ ' even if he did not kill her , which is what i understand the guy ’s saying , it was – you know , that it – it was an accident , ' @entity228 said			0
in january investigators also revealed that @entity14 has declined to be interviewed for the latest inquiry			0
detectives began re-investigating the case in november 2011			0
investigators interviewed more than 100 people – including mr @entity15 - but mr @entity14 refused and sheriff 's lt. @entity265 has said the actor 's representatives have not given any reason for his silence			1
the setup : on november 28 , 1981 , the 60 - foot yacht splendor set out for @entity9 , a rocky island off the coast of @entity10 , 22 miles from @entity66			1
aboard were @entity14 , @entity5 and the boat 's skipper , @entity39			2
the couple also brought @entity5 's newest costar , @entity15 , to celebrate their successful completion of filming for ' brainstorm , ' a science fiction thriller			2
@entity5 , @entity14 and @entity15 departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore , where they had dinner at @entity284 on the island			1
waitresses reported that all three @entity6 actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous			0
witnesses say all three were very intoxicated about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht , which was anchored offshore			0
exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery			0
the tragedy : @entity5 's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht about 8am on november 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia			1
her blood alcohol level at the time was 0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving			0
she also had motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system , which likely increased her level of intoxication			0
the time of death is estimated at about midnight at on november 29			1
' the fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight , especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm , ' according to the new report			0
however , @entity5 was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard , according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore .			2

a log has been uncovered that suggests @entity14 and @entity15 were engaged in a sexual act when @entity5 walked in on them on the night she died
