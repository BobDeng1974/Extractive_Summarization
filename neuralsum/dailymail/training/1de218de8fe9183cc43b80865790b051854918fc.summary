by @entity0 women struggling to conceive have a right to receive treatment , according to @entity5 guidelines the health watchdog yesterday told @entity8 managers to stop refusing women @entity9 , warning it is having a ‘ devastating effect ’ on their lives			1
@entity5 has been forced to issue new guidance to local trusts over concerns there is a postcode lottery in the availability of treatment to couples struggling to have a baby			1
women under 40 unable to conceive naturally are meant to be offered three courses of @entity9 on the @entity8 while those aged 40 to 42 should be offered one			1
but figures show that three - quarters of the @entity29 - led bodies fail to adhere to these rules			0
this includes six which do not offer any fertility treatment at all			2
@entity5 – the @entity5 – has also told trusts not to refuse women treatment just because their husbands or partners have children from previous relationships			1
professor @entity40 , deputy chief executive of @entity5 , said : ‘ infertility is a recognised medical condition that can affect people of any age and has a potentially devastating effect on people ’s lives			1
‘ it can cause significant distress , depression and can possibly lead to the breakdown of relationships			0
‘ unfortunately , we know that not all areas are following our guidance			0
this creates variations in treatment within the @entity8 , which is disappointing and goes against the fundamental aims of the @entity8			2
’ the latest rules also remind organisations to offer cancer sufferers and other chemotherapy patients the chance to freeze their eggs before as the treatment can leave them infertile			2
but last month , a 25 - year - old artist was refused the £ 4,000 procedure by her @entity8 trust in @entity69 , @entity70 , as it disagreed with the policy			0
@entity72 suffers from a severe form of @entity75 ’s disease and is about to undergo a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy , which is likely to trigger an early menopause			0
@entity5 first issued its guidelines telling @entity8 trusts to offer at least three cycles of fertility treatment in 2004			1
but , more than a decade on , most still fail to comply			0
the watchdog warned the ' postcode lottery ' is leaving couples struggling to conceive ' devastated ' a survey of the 211 gp - led bodies called @entity88 earlier this year found that just 24 per cent offered the recommended three rounds of @entity9			1
the guidelines are not enshrined by law so @entity92 draw up their own policies depending on their budgets			0
typically , @entity9 costs £ 3,500 a cycle – or £ 10,500 for three – and managers are reluctant to fund it			0
@entity98 , co-chairman of the @entity99 , said : ‘ it ’s high time patients were allowed to access the treatment they are entitled to			0
’ she added that @entity5 ’s action will make it clear ‘ exactly what is needed to bring the unfair postcode lottery approach to an end ’			1
last week , commons leader and former health secretary @entity108 said @entity110 had ‘ responsibility ’ to obey @entity5 ’s guidelines even though they were not law			2
the issue was raised by @entity116 mp @entity115 , who told how women in her @entity119 constituency are offered one round of @entity9 up to 35 and refused thereafter .			2

fears *rising* over ' postcode lottery ' failing couples struggling to conceive
some women are refused treatment if husbands already have children
@entity5 ruled infertility is a medical condition that must always be treated
