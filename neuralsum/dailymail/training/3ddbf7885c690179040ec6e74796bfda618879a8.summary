by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 21 april 2013 seek and destroy : the lethal predator drone is 27ft long and comes armed with hellfire missiles drones are used for lethal and non-lethal purposes : they can track drug smugglers , monitor borders and search for earthquake victims , and environmentalists use them to catch illegal whalers and loggers			1
but the driving force behind the most sophisticated drones remains the military , who use them for spying and killing			1
their proliferation has led to thousands of deaths , the disruption of entire communities and increased political instability			0
the @entity22 example of sending drones wherever it wants and killing whoever it wants on the basis of secret information is leading to a world of lawlessness			1
innocent lives are snuffed out without a trace of accountability			0
drones do n’t give their targets a chance to surrender			1
this technology extends god - like powers to democratically elected leaders – and potentially to dictators and terrorists			1
those with armed drones include the @entity22 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
some 76 countries all told have drones , with many in the process of weaponising them			1
@entity48 is supplying drones to @entity56 in @entity57 ; @entity58 is selling lethal drones to @entity60 ; @entity47 is selling drones all over @entity58 and @entity62			1
the global drones arms race , spurred on by the @entity22 , is in full cry			1
and there are terrifying reasons why we should think very carefully about a world left to their unblinking mercy			0
technology : the @entity73 's infrared camera can identify a human from 10,000ft in the air following the 9/11 attacks on @entity78 in 2001 , the @entity22 military filled its shopping trolleys with every robot it could find : tiny ones that climb walls and stairs , snake - like ones that slither , and robots to carry soldiers ’ heavy loads			1
they also snatched up every type of drone on the production line and commissioned new ones			2
they bought the 38in - long @entity94 which fits in a rucksack and can be launched by throwing it into the air			2
they invested in the 27ft - long predator with its hellfire missiles , and later the more powerful reaper version			2
the @entity73 ’s infrared camera can identify the heat of a human from 10,000ft in the air , so from 8,000 miles away in @entity105 a drone ‘ pilot ’ or operator can watch an @entity106 as he lights a cigarette or talks to friends			2
then the @entity22 bought the 40ft - long @entity112 with its long - range surveillance capability of 40,000 square miles a day			1
drones can fly low and slow over hostile terrain , and hover for hours , or all day if need be			2
the @entity116 can linger in the air for about 18 hours			0
others have an endurance of weeks			0
then there is the vulture			0
solar panels cover its massive 400ft wingspan and enable it to stay in the air for up to five years			0
@entity125 has already produced a prototype for its @entity128 drone , roughly the size of a fighter jet , which flies itself			2
powerful : the @entity116 model can ling in the air for about 18 hours but others have an endurance of weeks @entity136 ’s drones include the @entity137 , better known as the @entity137 , which has a wingspan of roughly 40ft and is said to have provided surveillance for the operation to execute @entity141			2
in 2000 , the @entity142 had fewer than 50 drones			1
a decade later , that number had soared to nearly 7,500			1
most were used for surveillance , but the number of weapons strikes kept increasing , from 74 in 2007 to 839 by 2012			0
the @entity148 has been piloting @entity116 drones from @entity150 in @entity105 since late 2007 , and they will soon be flown remotely by pilots at @entity152 in @entity153			2
the most extensive drone programme outside a war zone is run by the @entity156			0
between 2004 and 2012 , it conducted more than 350 drone strikes in @entity159 , with a spike of 118 attacks in 2010 , killing somewhere between 2,600 and 3,400 people			1
local councils , police and security agencies , private companies and even our neighbours will soon be able to pilot drones over our homes			0
a former @entity172 airfield in @entity173 in @entity174 is being used as a centre for testing military and civilian drones , including the @entity178 surveillance aircraft			0
four police forces have tried them out , and they are used regularly for surveying crops and in the offshore oil industry			0
in war zones , it has been claimed that of more than 600 hellfire missiles fired by @entity73 , 95 per cent hit their targets , with failures attributed to mechanical fault or a target moving at the last instant			0
in july 2011 , @entity46 drone operators made a mistake that killed four civilians in @entity106 with missiles fired from @entity116 drones piloted out of @entity105			1
even when they do hit their target , there is no guarantee that the victim really is a terrorist and apparently no way of avoiding ‘ collateral ’ damage			0
also undermining communities is the horrendous @entity22 practice of striking one area multiple times , a tactic known as ‘ double taps ’			1
with rescuers having been killed for their efforts , people are now afraid to assist the injured			0
drone attacks are stoking an endless fire of violence and revenge .			0

@entity112 drones arms race , spurred by the @entity22 , is in full cry
in 2000 @entity142 had 50 drones - a decade later that had soared to 7,500
