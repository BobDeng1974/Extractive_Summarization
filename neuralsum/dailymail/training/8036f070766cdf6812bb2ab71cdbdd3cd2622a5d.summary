@entity0 is convinced @entity2 ’s new swagger and style will keep them away from a relegation battle this season			1
that view comes in spite of a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity9 on @entity10 that left @entity2 only five points clear of the bottom three			1
but @entity0 believes he has seen enough in the four games since @entity2 adopted a possession - based game to be sure of survival			1
there have been signs of encouragement , namely the draw with @entity20 and the fact they dominated possession away against a team like @entity9 , but @entity2 have taken only four points since ditching their counter-attacking , direct style			1
they are enjoying having a lot of the ball rather than chasing it			0
‘ we have found a way that really suits us			0
there will be so many twists and turns throughout the season but if we keep doing what we ’ve been doing we will be fine			2
’ @entity0 added : ‘ history tells you in years gone by you have to earn the right to stay in the league regardless of how big your name is or how big the club is			2
‘ they say get 40 points and see what happens			0
we have got 20 , last year it took us until january time to get 20 so that ’s an improvement			0
’ @entity0 issues instructions to forward @entity61 in the defeat to @entity9 @entity2 have at least , and at last , witnessed a return to form for @entity65 striker @entity64 yet there is no escaping a dreadful goals tally of 11 in 18 @entity69 fixtures			1
but @entity0 insists there is not a confidence problem in his side , of whom only @entity61 and @entity73 have reached three goals this season			2
‘ the way we have played over the last few weeks is nothing to do with confidence			0
it ’s been to do with good goalkeepers — we have had some poor finishing but it ’s not a lack of confidence , ’ he said .			0

@entity2 lost 1 - 0 to @entity9 on @entity10 in the @entity69
but manager @entity0 insisted his team are improving this season
@entity0 said his team 's new style of play will help them avoid relegation
