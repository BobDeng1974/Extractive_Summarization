ever swooned over a random passer - by 's dress but been too afraid to ask them where they bought it ? a new app , which works in a similar way to @entity6 - the music app that identifies a song based on a brief audio clip - aims to help bridge the gap between those shoes you saw on someone at a party and snapping them up for yourself			1
@entity16 uses visual recognition technology , the help of personal stylists , and social media to instantly scout out the exact item you 're looking for			1
a new app called @entity16 aims to help fashion fans track down a stranger 's outfit at the touch of a button all you do is take a photo of the item on someone , a piece of fabric or a rip from a magazine and the app scans it and searches for a match in its database			1
if it 's unable to find what you 're after , it suggests a range of similar products and click - through links to buy			0
it also has a database of stylists on hand who promise to send you five similar suggestions within 24 hours via email			1
