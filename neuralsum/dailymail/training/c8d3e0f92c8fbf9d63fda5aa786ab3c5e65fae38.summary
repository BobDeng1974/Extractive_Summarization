@entity0 and a host of talented youngsters are fighting an uphill battle for @entity5 recognition at clubs deemed unfashionable in the lower half of the @entity8 , according to @entity9			1
the veteran wing , who was part of the team which reached the @entity14 final in 2007 , believes his @entity16 team - mate and some rising stars at the club , along with others outside the title - chasing elite , struggle to force their way into test contention			1
earlier this month , @entity24 director of rugby @entity25 suggested his in - form no 8 @entity27 would be playing international rugby by now if he were at a more ‘ fashionable ’ club			1
@entity0 is struggling for @entity5 recognition despite his displays for @entity31 this season no 8 @entity0 impressed during @entity5 's tour of @entity33 last summer @entity9 said : ‘ @entity25 ’s right			1
naturally , if you are in a team which is winning more games than it is losing , then your job is a bit easier			0
you can generally put in better performances week after week , so naturally the teams at the top of the league attract more interest from @entity5 coaches			1
‘ last year , there were rumours that @entity48 and @entity49 were told that moving to a more southern club would enhance their chances with @entity5			2
i hope that is n’t the case because it would be absolutely horrific for a coach to say that			0
’ @entity0 has been left out of the latest @entity5 squad despite his stellar form this season and @entity9 added : ‘ @entity61 is a classic example			1
if he were at one of the top few clubs , no doubt there ’s a lot more chance that he would be involved			0
‘ but regardless of how a club are performing , if a player is putting in outstanding performances every week , he ’s got to be looked at , whether he ’s playing at the top or the bottom of the league			0
‘ if anything , putting those performances in for a bottom - half - of - the - table team means he deserves a chance more than if he was at a top team			0
veteran wing @entity9 ( left ) has accused @entity5 of ignoring players from unfashionable clubs ‘ there are a lot of things @entity0 can do which other 10s ca n’t , and he can do it when he ’s on the back foot			1
he came away from that @entity33 tour last year with credit in the bank , but he still has n’t been given a chance			0
’ @entity0 is waiting to discover if he will be in the revised @entity5 squad announced next wednesday , as he weighs up whether to sign a new deal with @entity16 or explore the option of a move to @entity94			1
‘ the decision i make will not be based purely on @entity5 selection , ’ he told @entity95			1
‘ it ’s a difficult decision that i have to make in the next couple of weeks			0
’ sale have a number of promising rookies emerging this season , particularly teenage full back @entity105 , wing @entity106 and no 8 @entity104			1
@entity9 hopes this trio and others can go on to earn @entity5 call - ups and fulfil their potential , without having to move elsewhere			1
‘ hopefully we can keep them and they can be the heart and soul of the club for years to come , ’ he said			0
‘ but if players do n’t feel the club are really investing and showing ambition , then they ’re not going to stay around			0
guys do n’t just want to play for @entity5 , they want to be in the play - offs and win trophies			2
’ @entity104 ( left ) is one of several players hoping to realise their @entity5 dreams at sale youngsters will @entity106 ( left ) and @entity105 also deserve a call - up , according to @entity9 that is certainly the case for @entity24 ’s @entity5 prop , @entity132 , who has agreed to join champions @entity133 in the summer			1
the @entity24 are angry that the 24 - year - old tighthead showed no desire even to consider staying at @entity136 , where his career was resurrected following an ill - fated stint at @entity140			0
@entity141 said : ‘ we ’re obviously disappointed to see @entity132 head to @entity133 , as we would have liked him to stay here , at the club that has helped him to develop into the full @entity5 international he is today			2
’ @entity148 confirmed that director of rugby @entity149 has left his post and the @entity152 are poised to announce @entity154 coach @entity153 as his successor			0
