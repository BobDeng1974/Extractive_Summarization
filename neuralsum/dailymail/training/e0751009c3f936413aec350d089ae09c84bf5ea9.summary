by @entity0 for @entity1 a council has been blasted after warning undertakers it can only cremate one obese person a day on health and safety grounds			2
@entity7 have written to funeral directors informing them they can only accommodate one service a day for people weighing over 21 stone			1
they said the extra workload involved and ' health and safety issues ' meant that overweight people had to be cremated before 11am at their crematorium in @entity16			1
@entity7 has written to funeral directors with new rules banning them from cremating more than one obese person a day the crematorium can cater for coffins weighing up to 45 stones but have said only one casket will be accepted each day			1
the move has been criticised by funeral directors who say it is discriminating against the families of overweight people			1
@entity27 , who runs a funeral directors in @entity29 , said : ' to me the council are discriminating against people who are over that particular weight			1
' in fact with the weight of the coffin it will be people who are 20 stone and over			2
i think if they were challenged legally i do n't see how it would stand up in court			0
' i do n't like it and i think it is very unfair that funeral directors will have to tell bereaved families that their loved ones ca n't be cremated on a particular day because of these guidelines			1
' in a letter sent to local undertakers , @entity48 , the council 's bereavement service manager , said : ' when receiving heavy coffins into the crematorium we must follow certain procedures to ensure a dignified service is given to both the deceased and their family			0
while a standard casket typically measures between 24 and 27 inches wide , manufacturers are now producing boxes as wide as 52 inches , capable of fitting a person weighing up to 1,000 pounds ' there are also certain health and safety as well as manual handling issues that have to be considered			0
' the instructions from the manufacturers are that cremations of a larger size should be the first cremations of the day			0
' as we have a policy of not holding the deceased to the day after the service please note that the latest service will be 11am for a funeral service when the deceased is 140kg/21 stone or more			2
' critics have also pointed out that the policy will punish families from rural parts of @entity82 who will have to travel long distances to services early in the morning			0
funeral directors have previously told how they have been forced to call in fire fighters and cranes to move supersize coffins			1
mourners have also been asked to sign waivers preventing them from suing for compensation if they injure themselves while carrying mammoth coffins @entity94 , the council 's head of facilities , waste and ground services , said : ' we are one of the few councils in the country with capacity for larger coffins up to the maximum weight of 285kg/45 stones			0
' there has been no change in our policy , however , we are reminding funeral directors that when receiving heavy coffins we must follow certain procedures to ensure a dignified service is given to both the deceased and their family			2
' as with all services at the crematorium we will work with funeral directors to facilitate any request from bereaved families			1
' we can , in certain circumstances , facilitate two funerals for larger coffins on the same day			0
' this is subject to certain health and safety and @entity127 regulations together with manufacturer 's instructions that we must follow as the cremations process requires to be started from a lower than normal cremation temperature			0

@entity7 write to funeral directors with new rules
it told them only one person over 21 stone can be cremated a day
firms say it is discriminating against families of overweight people
