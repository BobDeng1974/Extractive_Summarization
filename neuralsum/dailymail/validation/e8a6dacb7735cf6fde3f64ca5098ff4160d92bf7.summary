fancy footwork : @entity1 on @entity2 my husband is holding me in his arms , gazing fondly into my eyes and leading me across the floor in a series of sinuous moves that , quite frankly , i never imagined he could make			1
such a moment never seemed possible because , like many women , i have been made a wallflower by a ca n’t - dance , wo n’t - dance partner			1
we never even had an opening waltz at our wedding 30 - odd years ago			0
@entity19 , my husband , does n’t so much as bop at parties			0
however , with the help of @entity2 ’s @entity1 , we are getting the chance to take to the floor together – and in the process improve our fitness and our general mood , and even make our marriage healthier			1
dressing up and taking your partner ’s hand to dance à deux is catching on all over again , thanks to the huge success of the tv dance show			1
‘ learning dance steps allows couples to enjoy the closeness of each other and creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy , ’ says @entity1 , who has partnered celebrities from newscaster @entity36 to pop singer @entity37 on the tv show			1
‘ some therapists suggest it as a form of marriage counselling			1
it allows men to lead and feel in charge again , and women to feel they are being taken care of by their partner			1
‘ plus it releases endorphins as your heart rate goes up			0
’ and so i found myself relearning the essential 12 steps of salsa for the first time since i did the cha - cha - cha at @entity66 ’s saturday morning ballroom classes for children , decades ago			2
dancing was in my blood : my father danced his teens and 20s away and became an eight - times ballroom dancing champion			2
@entity1 is giving @entity19 and me a taste of the weekend workshops she ’s running at @entity77 health spa over the next few months			1
but i find myself wondering how her students are going to cope with a class lasting three - quarters of an hour when we are knocked out after ten minutes of practice			0
‘ i feel like a robot , ’ grumbles @entity19 , who has zero ballroom experience but bucks up when @entity1 puts @entity84 on the sound system			1
he is musical – playing guitar – but his sense of rhythm does not extend to his feet , which @entity1 says is surprisingly common			1
as for me , although i spent two years of my teens jiving in @entity94 discos , learning specific steps 40 years on is a discipline i ’m finding taxing			2
it ’s a more demanding workout , in fact , than anything i did on a brain - improvement programme i recently attended			2
‘ you need to focus absolutely , ’ explains @entity1 , who says the extreme attention needed to learn a sequence is good for improving mood as well as fitness			2
‘ when i started partnering @entity37 he was extremely down , but felt the dancing had a very positive effect			0
‘ like yoga , ballroom dancing takes you out of yourself ; you ca n’t think of anything else while you ’re practising , so it takes you away from your everyday worries			0
’ masterclass : @entity116 dances with @entity1 as @entity19 looks on			2
the @entity2 star says learning dance steps together creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy between couples a recent study in @entity124 suggested that dancing can elicit an improvement in mood			1
another soon - to - be - published study shows that learning to dance improves leg muscle architecture in older women , while dementia patients were found to feel much better after taking a @entity134 ballroom class for a 2013 study			1
the aerobic effect is obviously a plus for weight loss ; @entity1 says @entity36 lost more than two stone while training with her for an unimaginable eight hours a day			2
i say ‘ unimaginable ’ because after 15 minutes , my reluctant partner and i are so winded that we wonder whether we can even survive till the end of our session			0
i blame my shortness of breath on the need to accomplish a full underarm twirl in just three steps , every minute or so			0
even so , given that our other steps involve only a gentle rocking back and forth and bringing feet together , my heart rate is raised in half the time it takes when i walk at nearly 4mph on the treadmill			0
@entity19 becomes furious as he keeps forgetting to switch to the side - step that kicks off the next part of the salsa sequence			0
@entity1 reassures us that we are no worse than any beginners , and half an hour later we ’re congratulating ourselves on remembering all 18 steps of our sequence and even keeping time with the music			1
i could see myself going on to tackle the foxtrot , the quickstep and tango			0
but first , i need a partner – the one i ’ve got says he prefers his salsa with avocado on a nice tortilla			0
at least @entity77 will guarantee everyone who books @entity1 ’s course someone to dance with			1
strictly ballroom weekends cost from £ 395 and take place on march 28 - 29 and may 22 - 24			0
