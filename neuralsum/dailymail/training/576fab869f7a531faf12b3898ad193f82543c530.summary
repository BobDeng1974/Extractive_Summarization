by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 09:22 est , 5 october 2012 firefighters do some of the most dangerous work of all emergency services workers			2
to save life and limb they fearlessly put themselves in harm 's way - sometimes paying the ultimate price			0
there are times , however , when no amount of courage will get the job done ; when the risks are so great that attempting to rush in is likely to do more harm than good			0
the makers of the @entity19 remote control firefighter claim it is the world 's first robot designed to help save lives by removing the human element from the dangers of disaster control			1
it can be remote controlled from up to a quarter of a mile away , meaning that firefighters can close in on hazardous blazes and battle the flames with the high - pressure hose that spews up to 600 gallons a minute			1
propelled by durable caterpillar tracks able to traverse the most rugged terrain , the @entity19 is designed to withstand conditions that would spell the end of other robots the same size			1
the robot is small enough to enter through an average size door , allowing access to hitherto difficult to reach interior spaces , yet powerful enough to drag weights of up to 1,270lbs			0
tiny but mighty : the @entity19 's powerful high - pressure hose can spew up to 600 gallons per minute invaluable tool : the robot is perfectly designed for dealing with those incidents that are too hazardous for human firefighters to get close too schematic : the robot is small enough to enter through an average size door , allowing access to hitherto difficult to reach interior spaces , yet powerful enough to drag weights of up to 1,270lbs hand - made from @entity70 steel and aircraft grade aluminium in the @entity71 by @entity73 - based @entity72 , the @entity19 could herald a revolution in handling serious disasters and out - of - control fires			1
its makers say : ' the @entity19 is a durable , compact , and self - contained fire - fighting and emergency response robot capable of handling situations and blazes that up to now needed to be tended rather than fought			2
' from hazardous materials , chemical fires , train derailments or fuel farms , with this new tool the modern responder will not only be able to attack the problem , but can feel confident that their fire - fighters are safe doing so			0
' by providing stand - off distance , remote capabilities , and a multi-directional monitor you can be assured that safety was and is our foremost concern .			0

@entity19 @entity99 firefighter can be operated from up to *1/4* mile away
propelled by caterpillar tracks , it can spew 600 gallons of water a minute
