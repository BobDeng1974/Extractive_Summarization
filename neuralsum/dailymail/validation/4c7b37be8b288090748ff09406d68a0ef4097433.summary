@entity0 might have played a key role in @entity4 's @entity3 exit against @entity5 , but the @entity8 forward 's form otherwise is as good as any other striker in @entity10			1
only @entity11 can match his statistics in 2015			0
@entity0 has 11 goals in 15 games so far this calendar year , a ratio that puts him ahead of @entity18 winner @entity17 as one of @entity10 's leading marksmen and his strikes have helped @entity4 to become the @entity23 's form team			1
their @entity8 centre forward 's impressive streak has helped @entity4 move to within a point of second - placed @entity28 and they look all - but certain to qualify for the @entity3 in one of the most competitive battles for the top four in recent years			2
@entity0 has been in fine form for @entity4 so far in 2015 , notching 11 goals in just 15 appearances @entity17 , @entity34 's prolific forward , has a lower goals per game rate than @entity0 in 2015 player appearances goals goals / game @entity0 15 11 0.73 ronaldo 15 10 0.66 @entity17 and @entity11 are generally seen as unachievable benchmarks for most players in terms of goalscoring , but @entity0 is holding his own with the @entity48 forward			1
@entity11 , though , has 20 in 19 games averaging 0.95 goals per game			2
even the prolific @entity52 at north @entity53 rivals @entity54 can not quite match @entity0			0
his 13 goals in 18 games in 2015 giving him a rate of 0.72 , just slightly lower than the 28 - year - old @entity8			2
after scoring both goals in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win over @entity61 , @entity0 's efforts are being appreciated by his manager as well as his critics			1
@entity0 gets ahead of @entity61 defender @entity64 to score the first of his two goals at the weekend the @entity8 striker scored a second goal within four minutes , nodding in a corner with ease asked if @entity0 is world - class , manager @entity71 said : ' i think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it			1
but i believe there is still room for improvement			0
' technically , he is a much better player than he was			0
his touch , his link play , his finishing , they have all improved			0
if you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now , it is obvious he is a better player			0
' he is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength			0
at 22 or 23 he played in @entity88 in @entity8 , and now he is at @entity4			2
' @entity71 now ranks @entity0 as world - class and says he has improved since joining @entity4 @entity0 blows a kiss at full time against @entity61 , and his form has earned him a lot of love of late			1

@entity0 has a better goals per game ratio than @entity17
@entity8 forward scored twice in @entity4 's 2 - 1 win over @entity61
@entity11 is the only big - name striker in @entity10 with a better ratio
