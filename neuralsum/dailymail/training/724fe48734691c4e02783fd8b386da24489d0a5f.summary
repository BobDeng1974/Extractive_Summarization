from the bright lights and constant clattering of a tenpin bowling alley to the calmness of a fine art workshop , it has been quite the career change for @entity6			1
a few years ago , the 48 - year - old was working as the boss of a tenpin bowling business			1
now he is crafting a beautiful array of bespoke globes which sell up to £ 59,000 a time			1
his artisan globe company which has a-list clients from all over the world , one of whom has already paid full price for a ' @entity18 ' mounted on an aircraft engine replica made by the heritage technicians at @entity21			1
labour of love : @entity6 , 48 , and his team built the contents of this stunning workshop from scratch after he attempted to create a homemade globe for his father painstaking : the papering and painting processes take the longest to learn according to mr @entity32			1
he says a trainee will take the best part of a year to learn the skill gentle : the sections of paper are soaking wet when applied meaning even the slightest tension can cause a rip , forcing the craftsman to start again mr @entity6 , founder of @entity41 , was working as the boss of a bowling alley business six years ago when he made his first globe for his father 's 80th birthday			1
it was the lack of well crafted globes on the market which forced the maker 's hand			1
according to mr @entity6 , he wanted a globe which was n't a ' cheap mass produced item , but also was n't a 500 year old antique			1
the self - starting craftsman decided that he would make his own , and after 18 months of what he said was ' frustration and concentration ' his first globe and his new business was born			2
speaking from the studio in @entity63 , mr @entity6 said the process of learning to make globes had been more about persistence than talent			2
he said : ' i knew i wanted to get my father something different for his birthday , and a globe was just an idea i was toying with			1
in fact , to begin with i was thinking about making us one each , that was obviously before i knew anything about the work which is involved			0
' after 18 months of toil , and with his first far from perfect globe under his belt , mr @entity6 decided he would begin making more models to cater for what he saw as a gap in the market			1
but according to the modest businessman , the transition from part time hobbyist to full time craftsman was more to do with persistence than innate talent			0
he said : ' i could n't claim to be a natural , that 's for sure			2
when it comes to making globes i 'm not sure that there are any naturals it 's all about hard work and repetition			2
' that 's why i had to stay in the business really , i 'd put some money into the venture and i knew that the only was it would be a success would be to push and keep making these things until they became the products they are today			2
' range : @entity111 produce a range of different sized globes all to specification			0
the @entity117 globe , seen here mounted on a solid oak base , costs from £ 39,000 team effort : @entity120 employ specially trained artists to help with the production and application of the maps in their @entity63 studio @entity6 's first lesson to learn , one vital to making a proper globe , was how craft a truly round sphere which could then be covered in a map			1
explaining his first attempts as trying , the entrepreneur has since come to rely on some state of the are technology to make the base for his balls			0
he said : ' my first attempts were made of plaster of @entity139 using mathematical instruments , what you quickly learn is that the margin for error is tiny and so much can go wrong			0
' every time you mess up a measurement , you 're essentially multiplying that by @entity149 by the time you 're finishing the shape			0
' nowadays we use resin which is shaped using @entity154 fabricators to help us build the molds			0
we have a very high degree of accuracy now			0
' one the shape is complete , there comes the painstaking process of applying the maps			0
something , yet again , mr @entity162 says that there is no quick trick to			0
technique : the smaller globes , left , are made from solid granite which can weigh up to 2kgs while bigger versions are hollow and covered with paper segments , right he said : ' i have a trainee at the moment who has been with me for a few months learning to paper the globe , it will probably be another five until she does her first perfect one			2
' the papering process is long and requires complete concentration			0
the paper is wet so it will take the shape of the globe properly , but that makes it very fragile			0
' at times there will be five of us papering away on a big project and there wo n't be a word shared between us , you just ca n't take your eye off it '			0
@entity6 's maps are alterations of other cartographers ' @entity198 entrepreneur says he simply does not have to the staff or time to run a cartography business too , but the decorations on his globe 's have made them highly desirable			1
modestly , mr @entity6 will not be drawn on the household names who adorn their homes with his creations			1
he said : ' it 's true that we have customers who your reader will have heard of , but they 're no more important than my other customers , so i do n't like to single them out			0
quality assured : according to mr @entity6 , his workshop operates a quality over quantity policy , he insists it would be impossible to ' churn out ' his bespoke globes ' let 's just say a few of my customers have their own wikipedia @entity224 can work it out from that , ca n't you ? ' estimating that his workshop will turn out around 200 globes this year , the craftsman says his focus remains on quality and not quantity , adding : ' i 've never had anyone come back to me to say , your globe is broke , or scratched or misshapen ... or just not good enough			1
' the thought of that makes me feel really , really bad			0
i suppose that 's our driving force really , it keeps my commitment to quality , anyway			2
leader : @entity6 , right poses with the base of a sphere ready for covering in the magnificent studio			1
before globes , he spent his days as a bowling alley manager			0

@entity6 first made a globe as a present for his father 's 80th birthday just five years ago
when he *researched* the market he realised there was only one high quality bespoke globe maker in the world
he then started his own workshop crafting the magnificent creations which are *popular* with *celebrities*
