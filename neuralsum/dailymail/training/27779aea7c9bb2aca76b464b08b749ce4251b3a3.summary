@entity0 has denied inspectors from the @entity3 ' nuclear watchdog access to a key military site - ratcheting up tensions between @entity6 and the @entity7 and effectively ending a working dialogue			1
@entity10 ( @entity10 ) inspectors were turned away from a base in @entity12 , south east of the capital , where intelligence suggests nuclear weapons could be in development			1
it led to the @entity3 declaring a two - day meeting , intended to calm fears over the @entity21 's disputed nuclear programme , to be a ' failure '			1
and it said talks with @entity0 are now unlikely to be re-started - as the @entity7 continues to step up sanctions against the major oil producer			2
@entity28 talks : chief @entity3 inspector @entity29 in @entity31 before he made his way to @entity0 for the doomed two - day meeting nuclear : @entity0 president @entity35 ( left ) visiting @entity36 and @entity38 foreign secretary @entity37 ( right ) who has urged @entity39 not to attack @entity0 the aborted meeting came after @entity39 said it planned to deploy rocket interceptors from its ' @entity43 ' defence system in the @entity44 from monday			1
the technology , which is being incorporated into the ' heart of the @entity39 military ' , served to fan speculation the nation is gearing up for conflict			2
on saturday @entity0 docked two warships at a @entity53 port , and @entity0 bombers have been accused of targeting @entity39 diplomats across the world			0
@entity39 has pointedly refused to rule out a military response , prompting @entity38 foreign secretary @entity37 and the @entity58 to warn such an offensive would have grave consequences for the entire region			2
show of military might : one of the two @entity0 warships which crossed the @entity65 before docking at a @entity53 port on saturday in a move which will undoubtedly increase tensions in the volatile region moving forward : @entity0 has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research mr @entity37 's rhetoric goaded @entity0 into cutting off oil sales to @entity38 companies after he also accused the @entity79 regime of promoting terrorism			2
but the move will have little effect on @entity38 firms , which get well under one per cent of their oil from @entity0 since the @entity85 has already slapped sanctions on the country			0
the evolving conflict over @entity0 's nuclear programme is like a ' slow - motion @entity90 ' , a leading nuclear strategy expert has said			1
@entity92 , from @entity93 , said each side has only murky intelligence , leading to tempers running high and the danger of a devastating outcome			0
he told @entity99 : ' as a student of history , i ’m certainly conscious that when you have heated politics and incomplete control of events , it ’s possible to stumble into a war			0
' watching @entity0 , @entity39 and the @entity58 , he said , ' you can see the parties , slowly but almost inexorably , moving to a collision			0
' @entity10 ( @entity10 ) inspectors wanted to inspect a site at @entity12 , southeast of the capital , where it believes there is a containment chamber			1
this , it understands , is used to text explosives and suggests that @entity0 is developing possible nuclear weapons - a charge that @entity0 denies			1
the @entity31 - based @entity10 said in a statement : ' during both the first and second round of discussions , the agency team requested access to the military site at @entity12			1
@entity0 did not grant permission for this visit to take place			0
' @entity10 director general @entity132 added : ' it is disappointing @entity0 did not accept our request to visit @entity12			1
we engaged in a constructive spirit , but no agreement was reached			0
' earlier , @entity0 's envoy to the @entity10 , @entity139 , told the country 's @entity140 news agency @entity6 expected to hold more talks with the @entity3 agency , whose task it is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the world			1
but @entity132 's spokeswoman , @entity148 , made clear no further meetings were planned and said : ' at this point in time there is no agreement on further discussions			0
' @entity0 rejects accusations that its nuclear programme is a covert bid to develop nuclear weapons , saying it is seeking to produce only electricity			1
but its refusal to curb sensitive atomic activities which can have both civilian and military purposes , and its track record of years of nuclear secrecy has drawn increasingly tough @entity3 and separate @entity58 and @entity165 measures			1
the @entity58 and @entity39 have not ruled out using force against @entity0 if they conclude that diplomacy and sanctions will not stop it from developing a nuclear bomb			0
future : @entity0 said in january it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod , and it had to find a way to make them because @entity175 sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets in @entity179 , no immediate comment was available from the @entity180 on the @entity10 statement			1
an @entity10 report , published in november , suggested @entity0 had pursued military nuclear technology			1
it helped precipitate the latest rounds of sanctions by the @entity85 and @entity58 , which are causing economic hardship in @entity0 before a parliamentary election in march			0
the @entity10 visit came as @entity0 last week announced ' key advancements in its nuclear programme ' - inserting the first domestically made fuel rod into a research reactor in @entity6 and installing a new generation of @entity0 - made centrifuges at the country 's main uranium enrichment facility in the central town of @entity198			1
@entity58 and its allies want @entity0 to halt uranium enrichment , which they believe could eventually lead to weapons - grade material and the production of nuclear weapons			1
@entity0 has been enriching uranium up to 20 per cent , while uranium enriched to more than 90 per cent can be used for a nuclear warhead			0
the @entity10 team had wanted to talk to key @entity0 scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme			1
@entity0 has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years , saying they are based on ' fabricated documents ' provided by a ' few arrogant countries ' - a phrase authorities in @entity0 often use to refer to the @entity58 and its western allies			2
the @entity10 summarised its information last november in a 13 - page document drawing on 1,000 pages of intelligence			1
it stated then for the first time that some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons			1
one key finding was information that @entity0 had built a large containment chamber at @entity12 in which to conduct high - explosives tests			2
the @entity3 agency said there were ' strong indicators of possible weapon development '			2
the @entity10 said intensive efforts had been made to reach agreement on a document ' facilitating the clarification of unresolved issues ' in connection with @entity0 's nuclear programme			2
' unfortunately , agreement was not reached on this document , ' it said in an unusually blunt statement			0
the @entity10 mission 's lack of progress may have an impact on the chance of any resumption of wider nuclear negotiations between @entity0 and the six world powers , the five permanent members of the @entity252 plus @entity253			2
the @entity7 last week expressed some optimism at the prospect of new talks , particularly after @entity0 sent a letter to @entity85 foreign policy chief @entity258 promising to bring ' new initiatives ' , without stating preconditions			0
but the @entity58 and its allies may become more reluctant if they feel the @entity264 state is unlikely to engage in substantive discussions about its nuclear activities			0
the deputy head of @entity0 's armed forces was quoted yesterday as saying @entity0 would take pre-emptive action against its enemies if it felt its national interests were endangered			0
' our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger @entity0 's national interests , and want to decide to do that , we will act without waiting for their actions , ' @entity272 told the @entity280 news agency			0
in retaliation for oil sanctions , @entity0 , the world 's fifth - largest crude exporter , has threatened to close the @entity285 , conduit for a third of the world 's seaborne oil , while the @entity58 signalled it would use force to keep it open			0
the @entity291 has said there was still time for diplomacy			0
' @entity39 and the @entity58 share the same objective , which is to prevent @entity0 from acquiring a nuclear weapon , ' @entity291 spokesman @entity294 said when asked about a weekend visit to @entity39 by national security advisor @entity298			0
' there is time and space for diplomacy to work , for the effect of sanctions to result in a change of @entity0 behaviour			0

@entity10 inspectors refused access to @entity12
