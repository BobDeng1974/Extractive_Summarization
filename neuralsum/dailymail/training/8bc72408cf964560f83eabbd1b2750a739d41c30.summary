a year before two @entity2 football players were convicted in a 2013 gang rape , campus officials concluded there was a lack of evidence that ' nonconsensual sexual intercourse ' had occurred			1
the report from the @entity11 school 's @entity9 , @entity12 and @entity13 led to the expulsion of @entity15 , @entity16 and two other players			1
however , @entity2 has refused to release its on - campus findings , leading some to wonder if the panel determined the players had , in fact , raped an unconscious female student			1
according to the @entity25 , the school 's report concluded only that @entity15 was an ' accomplice ' in violating the woman 's privacy			1
a year before , @entity2 's internal review came to a different conclusion video footage taken during the june 2013 incident shows football players carrying an unconscious woman down a hallway and laughing as they photograph her and remove articles of her clothing			1
the school is now the focus of an investigation by the @entity45 @entity47 's @entity46 for its handling of sexual violence allegations			1
while that investigation is ongoing , @entity51 and @entity16 -- both 21 -- face a possible decades - long jail sentence after they were found guilty last week of multiple counts of sexual assault			1
the two remaining defendants alleged to have joined @entity30 and @entity15 in the dorm room attack , former players @entity57 and @entity58 , probably helped themselves by cooperating with authorities , but their consequences loom much larger now that their former teammates have been found guilty			1
university officials , experts on sex crimes and survivors of sexual assault at @entity2 and all over the country hope the verdict 's loudest signal goes out to women suffering in silence - telling them that justice is possible without destroying their own lives in the process			1
most college sex assaults do n't turn out this way			0
a recent @entity81 study found that 80 percent of campus rapes went unreported between 1995 and 2013 , compared to 67 percent in the general population			1
an attorney for one of the @entity87 football players convicted of raping an unconscious fellow student says he will ask that a mistrial be declared after learning that a jury member was a rape victim			1
@entity91 says the juror was asked during jury selection about past experience with the criminal justice system , as either a victim or defendant			0
@entity91 says the juror failed to disclose the rape			2
@entity91 said the person ' lied to get on the jury ' and ' got on with an agenda			0
' the juror 's attorney , @entity103 , said her client did not make misrepresentations			2
@entity103 said the juror 's past had ' no impact whatsoever ' on decision - making at trial			1
the @entity112 does not generally identify sexual - assault victims			1
a spokeswoman for prosecutors said they do not believe the issue will overturn the verdict			2
attorney : @entity15 's lawyer @entity91 says he wants to find out if the juror lied during selection easy decision : jurors ( from left ) , dr @entity122 , @entity123 and dr. @entity124 said they knew they had to convict @entity15 and @entity30 when they saw sickening cell phone footage of the attack the victim said she hopes her experience will encourage others to discuss how to end campus rapes			1
' i want to remind other victims of sexual violence : you are not alone , ' she said in a statement read by one of the prosecutors			2
' you are not to blame			0
' in this case , the evidence was overwhelming			0
jurors saw university surveillance video and the players ' own graphic cellphone images that put them at the scene			0
@entity15 could be heard laughing and encouraging the attack on video he shared while it was happening			1
testimony showed that he passed out condoms during the june 23 , 2013 attack			2
charging all four players with rape even though not all of them engaged in the act itself sends a strong message about holding people accountable , said @entity161 , a @entity162 professor who runs bystander intervention programs at campuses			2
only two players were accused of raping the student , but all four were charged with it because prosecutors held them criminally responsible based on their actions that night			2
@entity15 gets a hug from attorney @entity171 after being found guilty			1
the 21 - year - old was called an ' accomplice ' in violating the rape victim 's privacy in an internal investigation from jsut after the june 2013 incident ' the jury has spoken			1
now it is up to the court to impose an appropriate sentence on the defendants			0
the conduct revealed by the evidence at trial was profoundly disturbing and utterly unacceptable			0
' our heart goes out to the victim			0
her testimony was forceful and brave			0
she has received our care and support			0
' many months ago @entity2 found both defendants responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy , and we quickly discharged both of them from the football team and subsequently expelled them from the university			1
we are confident we acted appropriately			0
' since @entity2 first reported the incident to the @entity200 police , we have given our full cooperation to law enforcement , including the @entity204 's office			1
we will continue to do so			0
' the safety and security of our students is @entity2 's top priority			1
sexual violence will never be tolerated			2
incidents will be investigated , victims will be supported , and perpetrators will be punished			0
we will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every @entity2 student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress			1
' the trial provided a rare opportunity to see what rape really looks like , experts on sexual violence said			2
' there 's no shortage of rape and sexual assault cases being put out in the media , but very rarely do we hear all the graphic details of a sexual assault , ' said @entity232 , vice president of programs at the @entity233 of @entity200			1
and unlike so many other rape cases , this was n't a matter of ' he - said / she - said			2
' the video made it obvious the woman was unconscious and totally incapable of consenting , so it was impossible to suggest that she was somehow to blame , @entity232 said			0
the woman testified that the last thing she remembered was @entity15 giving her drinks at a @entity200 nightspot - and that she woke up the next morning in his dorm room , feeling sick and injured			1
to this day , she has no memory of the attack , she told jurors			0
rumors swirled around campus , but she did n't learn what had happened until well after police came to her			0
the players had tried to cover it up by erasing the images			0
testimony showed at least five other @entity2 athletes saw her in distress and did not report it			2
only when @entity2 officials stumbled across closed - circuit tv showing players carrying an unconscious woman through the dormitory and into the room did they begin asking questions and summon the police , who recovered the digital evidence that made all the difference in court			1
seeing the case through was n't easy			0
the woman cried quietly throughout the trial , and doubled over and appeared to vomit at one point when @entity30 was testifying			2
but the @entity112 and other news organizations preserved her privacy , and she endured the proceedings as a @entity2 graduate			2
the attack did n't keep her from finishing her degree , and she 's now pursuing a ph.d. in neuroscience at an out - of - state university			2
that a victim of gang rape managed to keep her academic career on track is a real achievement , advocates say , something @entity2 officials hope students everywhere will consider			1
@entity294 , @entity2 's vice chancellor of academic affairs , called the victim 's response ' forceful and brave , ' and said sexual violence will never be tolerated at the school			1
' incidents will be investigated , victims will be supported , and perpetrators will be punished			0
we will also continue our comprehensive ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the importance of every @entity2 student intervening when another student is at risk or in distress			1
' ' attackers ' : @entity310 , left , and @entity58 , right , are also accused in the rape case			0
all four men were expelled from @entity2 but never accused of rape by the university ' thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this difficult process			1
i 'm thankful that the criminal justice system will hold the defendants responsible for their violent crimes			0
the hard work of the law enforcement officers , prosecutors and victims ' advocates who dedicated so many months of their lives to this case has made justice possible			0
' i want to especially thank detective @entity331 , sgt. @entity332 , detective @entity333 , deputy district attorney @entity334 , assistant district attorneys @entity335 and @entity336 and victims ' advocates @entity339 , lt. @entity340 and @entity341			0
you are my heroes and i am so proud of and grateful for each of you			0
' i am also hopeful that the publicity this case has received will lead to a discussion of how we can end sexual violence on college campuses			0
finally , i want to remind other victims of sexual violence : you are not alone			0
you are not to blame			0

@entity15 , 21 , and @entity30 , 21 , were found guilty of raping an unconscious student in a dorm room in june 2013 with two other men
however , an on - campus investigation into the issue determined only that the men were in violation of sexual misconduct rules
all four *implicated* men were expelled but @entity2 refuses to release internal records of their investigation
*critics* of @entity2 's *opaque* investigation process -- and those of school 's *nationwide* -- question if the school determined a rape had , in fact , occurred
