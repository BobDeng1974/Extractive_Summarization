@entity0 escaped and committed an armed robbery after stuffing his bed with pillows so it appeared he was fast asleep an escaped prisoner terrorised a couple in an armed raid at their home – after stuffing his cell bed with pillows to sneak out of an open jail			1
@entity0 , 32 , was serving time for a string of armed robberies when he slipped out of @entity13 , leaving officers believing he was still asleep			2
with an unknown accomplice , he travelled to an address in @entity17 , 30 miles from the multi-category 1,261 - inmate prison near @entity19 , @entity20			2
a court head how the masked men , armed with a knuckle duster and a knife , forced their way inside before @entity0 threatened to smash terrified resident @entity26 ’s head in with a brick			0
they made off with cash , mobile phones and mr @entity26 ’s £ 10,000 @entity31 following the raid in june but @entity0 was caught after a police chase			1
jail guards had no idea the violent criminal – classed as ‘ dangerous ’ by his original trial judge – was missing until police rang to say he was in custody			1
@entity42 , prosecuting , said : ‘ the prison did not realise he had left until the police contacted them			0
he had left his bed with two pillows in it			1
’ yesterday mr @entity26 , 28 , and girlfriend @entity50 told of their shock that @entity0 was able to sneak out of prison to commit the crime			2
miss @entity50 , 23 , a receptionist , said : ‘ it ’s disgusting that he was able to get out of a prison to do this to us , particularly as he had been jailed for other burglaries and violent raids in the first place			0
‘ we have suffered a horrendous ordeal and were left so fearful of our safety that we had to move house			0
’ she said they could not believe it when police told them @entity0 was a serving prisoner			0
the couple plan to sue the jail for negligence			1
on tuesday @entity0 was jailed at @entity92 for a total of 11 years and six months after earlier pleading guilty to the aggravated burglary , dangerous driving and driving while disqualified			1
judge @entity96 said it was ‘ not quite clear ’ how he had escaped , but added that it was ‘ quite clear ’ how dangerous he was			1
she also told the court : ‘ there must have been planning to the extent that someone must have met him ( outside the prison ) to take him there ( to @entity17 )			0
’ @entity0 had been seen by jail staff at 9.30pm , but at 11.40pm he was outside mr @entity26 and miss @entity50 ’s house in @entity17			0
they used the brick to smash a pane on the front door to force their way inside , screaming ‘ it ’s the police ! ’ before @entity0 began rifling through miss @entity50 ’s bag			0
mr @entity26 , who works in logistics at a factory , told the @entity116 : ‘ i stood up to try to stop him emptying the bag , but he had picked up the brick and told me , “ sit down now or i will smash your head in ”			0
it was a really nasty incident			0
’ @entity0 , of @entity122 , @entity17 , had been given an indeterminate sentence , with a minimum of ten years , in 2007 for armed robberies committed with two accomplices			2
in one they terrorised a pregnant woman and her children before stealing £ 40,000 in possessions			0
pictured left is prisoner @entity132 , and right , a dummy found in the bed of his accomplice @entity0 's method of escape from @entity13 - by stuffing his bed with pillows to make it appear he was fast asleep - is actually tactic devised in one of the most notorious prison escapes of all time			1
in 1962 @entity132 , along with fellow prisoners @entity145 and @entity146 , escaped from @entity148 prison by leaving hand built dummies with human - like heads in their beds to fool the patrolling guards			1
they then crept out of their cells through tunnels they had spent years digging , before boarding a life raft when they reached the water			0
although it 's been claimed the three men have been spotted in the years since the prison break , there have been no confirmed sightings of the three and it is likely they all died attempting to make it across @entity170			2
in the decades since , the stunt has become one of the most infamous prison tales of all time , due to the fact it was remained the only successful escape from @entity148 , and its portrayal in @entity179 films including ' @entity180 ' starring @entity181			1
the dummy heads used by the @entity148 trio to fool prison guards into thinking they were asleep in bed the prison break was the inspiration for @entity179 film ' escape from @entity148 ' starring @entity181 , pictured			1

@entity192 stuffed his bed with pillows to fool guards he was in bed fast asleep
method was also used in only successful escape from @entity148 , which was made into a film starring @entity181
he then escaped and committed an aggravated burglary with an accomplice
the two smashed into a couple 's home and stole their £ 10,000 @entity31 *vehicle*
a judge yesterday sentenced him to another 11 years and six months in jail
