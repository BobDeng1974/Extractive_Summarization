unite chief @entity0 today praised shadow health secretary @entity2 as the best performer on the @entity5 front bench militant union boss @entity0 said it ‘ would n’t matter ’ if @entity7 was run over by a bus			1
the general secretary of @entity10 stuck the knife into the @entity5 leader – by saying the politician he most respected was potential rival @entity2			1
and he said he had still not decided whether he liked mr @entity7 – four years after he became leader			1
mr @entity2 , the former health secretary , is understood to be canvassing mps to see if he can count on their support in a future leadership bid			1
while mr @entity7 had a terrible party conference , making a widely - derided speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit or immigration , mr @entity2 received a lengthy standing ovation			1
he has pleased the left of the party – and the unions – by campaigning on what he claims is the privatisation of the @entity28			2
earlier this month , @entity5 nearly lost the @entity29 and @entity30 by - election to @entity32 – sparking fresh speculation over mr @entity7 ’s leadership			1
speaking on the @entity36 4 pm programme , mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity7 , and i hope this does n’t happen , could get run over by a bus tomorrow , and it really would n’t matter who takes his place			1
‘ what matters is the policies			2
we ’ve been saying this to @entity7 since he got elected			1
@entity5 have got to show that they are on the side of ordinary working people			1
‘ if he does that , he ’ll be the next prime minister			2
if he fails to do that , then of course , he ’ll be defeated and he ’ll be replaced as the leader			2
and therein lies a huge challenge to @entity53 ’ mr @entity0 said he thought mr @entity7 was a ‘ decent man ’ but he did not know him well enough to say whether he likes him or not			1
‘ he ’s a decent man			0
i ’m not sure the last time [ we talked ] we had a laugh , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t really know him well enough to say i like him			0
any talk about “ is he the right guy ” , it really does n’t enter into our vocabulary			0
i know that when i speak to him in private , i see a passionate guy , i see a guy who ’s committed to certain things			0
’ it would not matter if @entity7 ' full under a bus ' , mr @entity0 said - because it was all about the policies that the @entity5 took up rather than the leader shadow health secretary @entity2 has grown in popularity by vowing to scrap the government 's health reforms asked who on the @entity5 front bench he most respects , mr @entity0 said : ‘ to be honest with you the person who impresses me most is @entity2			1
’ mr @entity0 accused the @entity5 leadership of not taking the @entity32 threat seriously enough – something which nearly cost them a by - election in the north west , an area which should be rock - solid @entity5			1
‘ we made it clear to the @entity5 over a year ago , that if they thought @entity32 were just a concern for the @entity88 , then they were wrong , ’ he said			2
‘ the truth is that @entity7 speaks about “ we ’re listening and we know we ’ve got to change ”			2
at the moment we ’re seeing a lot of listening but not a great deal of change			0
‘ who knows what could happen			0
we were in spitting distance of losing a safe @entity5 seat , that ’s why @entity32 have got to be challenged			2
’ the @entity10 leader revealed he was a big fan of @entity100 , and doing karaoke to the @entity102			1
‘ you ’ll go back to the times where there was almost a paternalistic [ aspect ] to society , some of the huge corporations , ’ she said			0
‘ there ’s a paternalism which was as part of , i suppose , trying to share the wealth			0
‘ i ’m a big fan of @entity100			0
although it ’s a bit sanitised , you reflect this paternalistic approach			0
’ he added : ‘ i like karaoke			0
i like @entity102 songs , my favourite song is in my life			0
i can sing a nice song			0
