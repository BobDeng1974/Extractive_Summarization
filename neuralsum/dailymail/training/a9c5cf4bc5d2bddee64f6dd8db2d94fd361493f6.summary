last month , a study published in @entity74 , found that men value women ’s looks over other traits			0

women , however , indicated similar aversion toward those with low social status			0
according the study , men and women differ mostly on the low - end qualities that they want to avoid , not the high - end traits that they ideally desire .			0

the app , called @entity22 , matches you up with three people per day
the idea is to match people based on *common* interests rather than looks
at first , it blurs out any profile photos , which you can chose to reveal later
it also provides an ' ice *breaker* ' function to help you think of conversation
