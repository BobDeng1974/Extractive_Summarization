@entity3 ’s flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to £ 6,000 will not help bright youngsters from poor homes , @entity1 ’s biggest anti-poverty group warned last night			1
in a scathing assessment , the left - leaning @entity7 said the @entity11 ’s vow to bring down fees from £ 9,000 ‘ sounds progressive … but sadly it is n’t ’			1
the charity said there were ‘ better ways ’ to use the £ 3billion - a - year cost of the policy to help the poor , such as increasing spending on sixth - form colleges in poorer areas			1
coming under fire from left : the @entity7 has criticised @entity3 ’s flagship plan to cut university tuition fees to £ 6,000 it also pointed out that because low - paid graduates eventually have their fees written off , the policy would ‘ mainly benefit mid to high - earning graduates who ’d otherwise have been repaying all or most of their loans ’			1
also , there was ‘ no evidence ’ the rise in fees under the @entity37 had hit the level of applications from poorer students , said the foundation , which added : ‘ even if poorer students are put off , there is no evidence that these students would be much less deterred by fees of £ 6,000 than £ 9,000			2
‘ the biggest factor preventing young people from poorer backgrounds from going to university is that the majority do not get good enough results at school to even attempt it			2
’ launching the policy last week , mr @entity3 said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011			1
the @entity54 have opened a three point lead over @entity56 in a poll			0
they are up to 34 per cent with @entity56 on 31 in the survey from former @entity61 deputy chairman @entity60			0
last week ’s @entity60 poll had @entity56 in the lead			0
the new poll shows 42 per cent of voters believe @entity1 would be burdened with more debt under a @entity56 government			0
for the @entity54 it is 11 per cent			0
@entity56 is well ahead on improving the @entity68			0
he insisted poorer students would benefit , adding : ‘ the scourge of debt from tuition fees is not only holding back our young people , it is a burden on our country			2
’ but the proposal has been condemned as ‘ financially illiterate ’ by experts			2
@entity78 vice-chancellors are sceptical that a @entity56 government would make up the shortfall in fees			0
and many in mr @entity3 ’s inner circle fear his plan for a £ 3billion - a - year raid on the pensions of the better - off to fund his eye - catching initiative will cost the party votes			1
former @entity56 leadership contender @entity90 told @entity91 yesterday : ‘ i think it ’s generally understood that @entity3 was the person in his shadow cabinet who felt most strongly about doing something on tuition fees			2
’ at a @entity96 event in @entity97 yesterday , mr @entity3 was accused of ‘ electioneering ’ by a member of the public , who identified herself only as @entity101			1
launching the policy last week , mr @entity3 said he was determined to keep the pledge he first made in 2011 she told him : ‘ i would like to know why you are cutting the tuition fees in the light that a record number of students from poorer backgrounds are applying to university			1
' and also the fact that it ’s middle - class , better - off students who are going to be paying less			0
‘ the only conclusion i can get to is that it smacks of electioneering			0

@entity7 say mr @entity3 *'s* plan to cut fees wo *n't* work
@entity122 said there were ‘ better ways ’ to use £ 3billion - a - year cost of policy
pointed out change would mainly benefit mid to high - earning graduates
