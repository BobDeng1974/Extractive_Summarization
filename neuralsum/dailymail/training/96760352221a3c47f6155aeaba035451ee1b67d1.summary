@entity1 's children are growing up more pessimistic and less trusting than before one - child policy was introduced according to research			1
in @entity1 the law generally limits urban families to having just one child in an attempt to prevent further overcrowding in a nation with a population of over 1.3 billion			1
but researchers say the policy , which was introduced in 1979 , has had a negative impact and new evidence suggests as a result children are less trusting , less competitive , more pessimistic , less conscientious and more risk - averse than people born before the policy was implemented			1

@entity1 's little emperors are growing up more pessimistic and less trusting than before one - child policy was introduced , according to research the study 's authors say the one - child policy has significant ramifications for @entity1 society , leading to less risk - taking in the labor market and possibly fewer entrepreneurs			1
' trust is really important , not just social interactions but in terms of negotiations in business , working with colleagues in business , negotiating between firms , ' said one of the authors , @entity45			0
' if we have lower levels of trust , that could make these kinds of negotiations and interactions more difficult			0
' choice : @entity1 women walk their babies in a park in @entity26			2
the one - child policy has led to a major gender imbalance as many families favour having boys rather than girls ( file picture ) known to many as the one - child policy , @entity1 's actual birth - restriction rules are more complicated			1
the government limits most urban couples to one child , and allows two children for rural families if their first - born is a girl			1
there are numerous other exceptions as well , including looser rules for minority families and a two - child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons			1
the new work by @entity80 of @entity81 in @entity82 and co-authors is published online friday in the journal @entity85			0
the researchers said the results do n't necessarily apply to children born outside of the situation they studied : modern - day , urban @entity1			1
they recruited 421 @entity26 men and women who were born within an eight - year period that included dates just before and just after the policy took effect in 1979			0
about 27 percent of the participants born in 1975 were the only child in their families , rising to 82 percent of those born in 1980 and 91 percent of those born in 1983			2
researchers said the sample was better educated than the general population of @entity26 but otherwise similar			0
crowding : in @entity1 the law which generally limits urban families to having just one child in an attempt to prevent further overcrowding in nation with a population of over 1.3 billion they administered tests to measure their altruism , trust , trustworthiness , risk attitudes and competitiveness , and gave them personality surveys			1
@entity80 said the participants ' ages and views on ideological changes in @entity1 did n't appear to affect the results			2
the findings - including indications that those in the study were more sensitive and nervous - are no surprise , said @entity131 of the @entity132 at @entity133 , who was not involved in the research			2
' only children in @entity1 families are loved and given almost everything by their families and they can get resources at home without competition , ' she said			1
' once they enter society , they are no different from other people			0
having been overly protected , they feel a sense of loss and show less competitiveness			0
' @entity131 said parents of an only child tend to become overly nervous , when they are ill , for example , and ' that feeling will be passed on to the children and make them become more sensitive and nervous			2
' the @entity1 government credits the one - child policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty			1
but the strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations , even though such measures are illegal			0
couples who flout the rules face hefty fines , seizure of their property and loss of their jobs			0
last year , a government think tank urged @entity1 's leaders to start phasing out the policy and allow two children for every family by 2015 , saying the country had paid a ' huge political and social cost			1
' it said the policy had resulted in social conflict , high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long - term gender imbalance because of illegal abortions of female fetuses and the infanticide of baby girls by parents who cling to a traditional preference for a son			0
the researchers in @entity82 noted that children born long after 1979 will have grown up with very limited extended family and in a society dominated by those born into one - child families			1
so the psychological effects of the one - child policy ' would , if anything , be magnified , ' they wrote			2
@entity199 , a professor of educational psychology at the @entity201 in @entity202 who studies these children , was puzzled that the study 's findings showed poor performance so consistently in virtually all measures			0
she said she would have expected a more mixed picture , and she hopes follow - up research is done			2
in any case , there 's no reason to think that the results would be similar for children in the @entity215 , she said			0
in @entity1 the only child grows up with different expectations , @entity199 said , with @entity1 authorities emphasizing that ' these kids have to be the best possible			1
most @entity215 want their kid to be happy ; they 're not aiming for a world - class child of some sort			0
' careful studies done elsewhere that look for certain qualities in the only child find that ' on average , they 're pretty much like everybody else , ' she said .			0
