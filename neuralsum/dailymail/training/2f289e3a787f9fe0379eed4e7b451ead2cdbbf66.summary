dozens of children 's bodies exhumed from old graves have begun yielding the shocking secrets of a shuttered @entity6 reform school , shedding light on decades of abuse , rape and deadly violence			1
there was the 6 - year - old boy who ended up dead after being sent to work as a house boy			1
and another boy who escaped but was later found shot to death with a blanket pulled over his body and a shotgun across his legs			1
then there was the ' rape dungeon ' where students attending the @entity24 were taken and sexually abused			1
what the researchers have learned about the horrific acts carried out at the now closed @entity29 institution is outlined in a report released by the @entity31 as researchers continue grappling with the mystery of the graves and deaths there			1
they are not only trying to identify who was buried there , but the stories behind how they and others died at the school			2
beyond studying remains , researchers are looking through the school and state records , newspaper archives and interviewing boys ' families , former inmates and former school employees to provide a history of the dead			1
' maybe i 've been doing this too long , but i 'm not surprised at what horrible things people do to one another , ' said @entity31 anthropologist @entity62 , the team leader who has researched other mass graves			2
' it 's just really sad the way people treat one another , which may be in part what 's captured the public 's attention on this â€” just the sense that it 's not right			0
' the report , prepared for the @entity109 , identifies two more people buried in graves , in addition to three who were identified previously			1
one was @entity114 , an employee who died in a 1914 dorm fire			0
while there was n't a @entity118 match , remains found are consistent with his age and cause of death			1
bring up the bodies : researchers have found the remains of 51 people buried at the school during a dig that also uncovered garbage , syringes , drug bottles and a dog encased in an old water cooler the other was @entity135 , who was brought to the school in 1915 at age 18 and later wound up dead in a case that still has unanswered questions			1
@entity135 was identified through a dna match with his relatives			0
to date , the remains of four people have been identified through dna matches			2
it 's not an easy project			0
the school underreported deaths ; did n't provide death certificates , names or details in many cases , particularly involving black boys ; and simply reported some boys who disappeared as no longer at the school			2
and many in the @entity157 community do n't want to talk about the school 's dark past			0
several of the boys were killed after escape attempts , including @entity163 , whose family lived a few miles from the school			2
he was hiding in his family 's house and men from the school came looking for him several times after the 1960 escape , according to relatives			2
first victim : @entity175 ( left ) was the first victim positively identified from one of the unmarked graves			0
pictured right is the hand of @entity180 , @entity175 's sister , gathering up an undated family photo of her brother update : @entity31 researcher dr. @entity62 , left , speaks to the media while sitting with @entity186 's detective @entity185 , right , on thursday the family came home one day to find his covered body lying in a bed			2
he had a shotgun wound and his father 's shotgun was lying across his legs			0
there 's also the story of 6 - year - old @entity196 , who the school sent out to work as a house boy in 1918			1
he was delivered back to the school unconscious and later died			0
@entity175 's 8 - year - old brother @entity200 also disappeared from school records , which simply described him as ' not here			1
' other boys died after severe beatings , being smashed in the head or other injuries			0
former inmates and employees interviewed also told researchers about a ' rape dungeon ' where boys , some younger than 12 , were sexually assaulted			1
while many of the cases are nearly a century old , some of the dead have surviving brothers , sisters and other relatives still seeking answers			0
' to some of this is history , but for many of the people who are involved it 's actually their reality every day , ' @entity62 said			0
' they 're really committed and moved by this because it 's their direct family			0
' the first of the bodies to be identified by researchers last summer was 14 - year - old @entity175 , who was sent to the school after being caught in a stolen car			1
in december 1940 , @entity175 's mother , @entity233 , sent a letter to the school inquiring after her son 's welfare			0
she received a reply from superintendent @entity239 saying that no one knew where the teenager was			0
@entity243 : former inmates and employees interviewed told researchers ( pictured ) about a ' rape dungeon ' where boys , some younger than 12 , were sexually assaulted a month later , the family was summoned to @entity157 school and led to an unmarked grave			1
@entity175 was in it , they were told - he had escaped and was found dead under a house			2
@entity233 never accepted the story			0
when @entity175 's two - foot grave was opened last year , researchers found his body lying on its side without any clothes on with his hands over is head			1
the reform school for boys opened its doors in 1900 on 1,400 acres of land and closed down only in 2011 for budget reasons			1
some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse , but the @entity274 concluded after an investigation that it could n't substantiate or dispute the claims because too much time had passed			2
many former @entity279 inmates from that era call themselves ' the @entity24 ' after the white building where they say the worst abuse took place			1
in 2008 , the @entity284 held a ceremony to officially ' seal ' the building and recognize the boys who passed through it			2
speaking out : @entity290 sen. @entity289 , center , along with @entity31 associate professor @entity62 , left , and @entity186 sheriff @entity292 , right , speak to the media about the on - going research being done at the @entity24 at its peak in the 1960s , 500 boys were housed at the @entity300 school , most of them for minor offenses such as petty theft , truancy or running away from home			1
in 1968 , when corporal punishment was outlawed at state - run institutions , then - governor @entity305 visited and found the institution in disrepair with leaky ceilings , holes in walls , cramped sleeping quarters , no heating for the winters and buckets used as toilets			0
' if one of your kids were kept in such circumstances , ' he said then , ' you 'd be up there with rifles			0
' in september 2014 , the @entity31 team identified two more sets of remains belonging to 13 - year - old @entity327 and 12 - year - old @entity328			1
@entity327 died in 1934 , reportedly of pneumonia			0
@entity328 was beaten to death in 1944 , reportedly by four other boys while in a small confinement cottage on the property , known as the ' sweat box			0
' the other boys were convicted in his death .			0
