published : 07:44 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 02:00 est , 5 september 2012 @entity0 caused a stir when she declared that she is hated by other women for her beauty , but the @entity5 journalist , who became the fourth person to be evicted from celebrity @entity7 last friday , says her experience on the show has only strengthened her views on the subject			1
the 41 - year - old insists that the fact that all of the evictees from the series so far have been women , proves her point that females are often against each other			1
‘ women do n’t like each other very much , ’ she said during an interview on celebrity @entity7 ’s @entity22			2
you 've been evicted ! @entity0 leaves the celebrity big brother house goodbyes : @entity0 says farewell to the @entity31 house on friday ‘ the fact is , there were seven women in that house and now there are just two			2
had we bonded together and formed a clique like the guys have done , there would still be seven of us in there and just two guys			2
‘ but the guys are smart , they grouped together and had each other ’s back			2
’ reality tv star @entity45 , glamour model @entity46 , @entity0 and lingerie model @entity47 have all exited the @entity49 show , meaning @entity51 star @entity50 and @entity52 presenter @entity52 are the only females remaining			1
she says that many of the male housemates , particularly comedian @entity56 and @entity58 star @entity57 , have been flying under the radar in the house , saving their best lines for the diary room			1
‘ the guys are like extinct volcanoes , ’ she added			2
‘ @entity57 just works on his sun tan , and @entity56 sits there looking bored out of his mind			1
except when they get to the diary room and it all explodes ! ’ high praise : @entity0 looked up to housemate @entity50 thought you were beautiful ? @entity0 was forced to wear warts on her face and a bald wig during a task @entity0 , who lives in @entity77 with her husband @entity78 , is desperate to be a mother and has recently been undergoing ivf treatment			1
she admits that she enjoyed mothering younger housemates such as olympian @entity82 and @entity84 star @entity83			1
baby plans : @entity0 and her husband @entity78 are hoping to conceive a child with the help of @entity90 treatment ‘ people have commented on the fact that i was like a mother figure in the house and that i looked after all the young ones like they were my own and i really liked that , ’ she said in a recent interview			2
‘ i think there is no shame in saying i would like to be domestic or a good housewife as a career choice and maybe that ’s what i ’d like to do next			2
‘ i loved it when people called me mum in the house , as that ’s my biggest aspiration right now			0
‘ during her time in the house , @entity0 was particularly critical of @entity47 and @entity46 , who she accused of emotionally manipulating the male housemates			1
but she says her opinion of @entity56 has changed considerably now that she ’s had time to watch episodes of the show ‘ he ’s a misogynistic snob is n’t he ? ’ she exclaimed			1
‘ he does n’t like women			0
he does n’t like working class people			0
he does n’t like my accent			0
i do n’t think i could ever have won him round			0
’ one housemate @entity0 is full of praise for is @entity50 , and she admits she was stunned to hear the eviction crowd shouting ‘ get @entity50 out ! on friday evening			1
‘ she ’s a 70 - year - old woman , she is registered disabled , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ she talks about everyone behind their backs , but so does everyone else			0
‘ the remaining housemates have turned against @entity50 in the last few days , and the pensioner reacted badly when she discovered that she was up for eviction , along with @entity57 and @entity128			1
‘ the problem is , the guys are really clever , as is @entity52 , ’ says @entity0			0
‘ @entity50 is the strongest housemate and they want her out			1
’ @entity0 also insisted that she had no regrets about the article that brought her into the spotlight			0
women in the firing line : @entity0 was up for eviction along with @entity47 and @entity52 teary : @entity0 became emotional when she discovered she was up for eviction ‘ that story i wrote in april was my idea , ’ she said			0
‘ it came about when i noticed one of my female neighbours consistently ignoring me and it stemmed from there			0
‘ i was made to feel that she not only did n’t like me but also that she did n’t want me in her social circle at all , purely because she felt threatened and thought i might fancy her husband			0
‘ well , that made me angry and i thought i would write down the very thing that i know lots of women have experienced but are too scared to say out loud			0
