indeed , @entity55 common pleas court judge @entity54 said that she had not decided what sentence to impose on @entity49 , who had earlier pleaded no contest to the charges following her arrest for striking @entity11 when he drunkenly stumbled onto @entity61			1
' it almost brought me to tears , ' said judge @entity54			1

' there was no reason for two lives to be lost , ' he said			0
' we already lost one			0
we ca n't change what happened to @entity11			2

' discovered dead at the scene , the police investigation led back to @entity49 , who was arrested			0

' @entity16 has been seeking counseling in the aftermath of the accident and she was n't charged with @entity11 's death at the time of her arrest because he was drunk			1
