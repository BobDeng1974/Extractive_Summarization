the congresswoman whose baby survived after a pre-natal diagnosis of an extremely rare and largely fatal condition has opened up about her ' miracle ' daughter who was the first known survival story			1
' the doctors said , " it 's 100 per cent fatal			0
she will either be stillborn , you 'll miscarry , or she will suffocate in your arms after she 's born , " ' congresswoman @entity10 told @entity11			1
her daughter , @entity15 , is now nine months old and healthy and crying like other children her age - but the difference in her case is that there was a large chance she was going to be born without lungs			1
@entity24 steps : though @entity15 is still on dialysis as she awaits a kidney transplant , her happy parents @entity10 and @entity26 are able to live with her at their home in @entity30 @entity15 is one of the 1 in 3,000 children who is afflicted with @entity33 sequence , wherein the fetus does not have kidneys or lungs			1
even though doctors said she would never survive , mrs @entity10 and her husband made the decision not to have an abortion			1
' as the doctor is saying these things , i could feel her moving			2
to me , that was a sign i was not going to be the one that ends this pregnancy , ' the 35 - year - old new mom told people			2
after announcing that her then - unborn child had the condition , a parent whose child had a similar disease reached out to @entity57 and suggested she try an experimental treatment that helped save their son			1
@entity61 , a doctor at @entity62 who specializes in high - risk pregnancies , had developed a way to inject a small amount of saline into the womb that acts create substitute amniotic fluid			0
growing rapidly : @entity10 and her husband @entity69 first publicized their daughter 's condition two months after she was born ( pictured then ) but have now opened up about how she continues to improve dramatically miracle : @entity75 is the first known case where a child survived after being diagnosed with @entity33 's syndrome , which causes babies to be born without lungs or kidneys fetuses with @entity33 's syndrome are not able to produce their own amniotic fluid because they are missing the organs - the kidneys - that are normally tasked with that job			1
babies with @entity87 typically die within a few days of being born - if not instantly , according to the @entity88			0
the most dangerous aspect of the condition is that the victims are born without kidneys , which normally produce amniotic fluid			2
because the amniotic fluid is not produced , the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus , which can lead to abnormal facial and limb development			0
the condition may also stunt the development of the lungs			0
the experimental new step that the @entity10 's decided to take was to have a small amount of saline injected into the womb which acted as a substitute form of amniotic fluid and helped the baby 's lungs form			1
the amniotic fluid helps allow the lungs to grow , and although an expert in the new procedure , even dr @entity61 was not confident about the results in the @entity10 's case			1
there were some signs of progress , however , that helped convince the @entity118 and her law student husband know that they were on the right track			0
one such instance came when the baby 's head , which was at first mishapen , suddenly grew to the normal shape and its little legs were initially clubbed and then corrected themselves			0
' the difference between 0 per cent hope and 0.00001 per cent hope is enormous , ' @entity26 said to the magazine			0
@entity15 , who was born weighing only 2lbs 12oz stayed in intensive care for the first five months of her life before being deemed healthy enough to go home			1
she will scream when her diaper is dirty			0
she is like any other baby			0
she has a few challenges , but man , she ’s determined , ' mrs @entity10 said during a @entity142 interview less than two months after the baby was born			1
the saline injection helped produce lungs for the newborn but she is not fully out of the woods as she still does not have kidneys			2
miracle baby : @entity150 and @entity151 can now hold their daughter @entity15 , who was born with a rare and usually fatal condition she is being treated with dialysis and will need a transplant but that is expected to come from her father @entity69 , who is a possible match			1
mrs @entity10 commutes to @entity160 from her home state of @entity30 in the northwest corner of the country , but her husband has taken time off from school to care for their daughter full time			1
the ongoing treatment is expensive , and @entity170 estimates that it costs about $ 260,000 but that is a price the couple is happy to pay given the grim prospects they first faced			0
@entity15 's story is already helping others , as a mother in @entity178 was given the same diagnosis and she talked to her doctor about ' this congresswoman doing amnio infusions '			1
they then underwent the same procedure and the baby was born with a healthy set of lungs			2
mr @entity26 said that like most parents , they were determined to never give up , and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help			0
rep. @entity10 ( right ) is pictured with her husband , @entity193 , and @entity196 speaker @entity195 during a mock swearing in			0
@entity198 has announced that her unborn child has @entity87 he added : ' there 's no guaranteed solutions and there 's no magical cures ... but do n't be satisfied with just one opinion because there 's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences			2
on a @entity212 page announcing the baby 's birth , the @entity210 revealed how they refused to give up on their baby			1
' multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that , if she survived to term , she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth , ' they wrote			0
' we were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible			2
the options we were offered were termination or “ expectant management , ” that is , waiting for her to die			0
instead , we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle			0

congresswoman @entity10 , 35 , gave birth to her first daughter @entity15 in july and the baby is doing well in spite of a dangerous diagnosis
doctors told the @entity210 that their baby was one of the rare cases of @entity33 's syndrome , where the child does not have kidneys or lungs
they were told that she would either miscarry or the baby would be stillborn so doctors suggested an abortion
' as the doctor was saying these things , i could feel her moving '
decided to go through with the pregnancy and learned of an experimental treatment that worked and helped the baby grow lungs
she was born *prematurely* and weighed only 2lbs 12oz and spent her first five months in intensive care before being allowed to go home
@entity15 is on dialysis because she still does not have kidneys and will have to have a transplant but her father is a possible match
