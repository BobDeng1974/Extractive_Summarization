by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:21 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 7 october 2013 an appeals court has sided with an @entity4 hospital that wants to force a 10 - year - old @entity6 girl to resume chemotherapy after her parents decided to stop the treatments			1
the court ruled that the parents ' beliefs can not outweight the state 's rights to protect the girl , @entity15 , and an attorney was granted immediate , limited guardianship over her , as well as the ability to make medical decisions for her			1
doctors at @entity21 believe @entity15 's leukemia is treatable but says she will die without chemotherapy			1
the hospital went to court after the family decided to stop chemotherapy and treat @entity15 with natural medicines , such as herbs and vitamins			1
this is the second time the court has sided with the hospital			0
battle : a court has ruled that @entity33 , pictured , in @entity4 can administer chemotherapy to a 10 - year - old @entity6 cancer sufferer after her parents stopped the treatment the appeals court ruling , issued last week , overturns a judge 's decision that said that keeping the parents from making medical decisions for their daughter would take away their right			1
' while we respect the wishes of the parents and believe them to be honest and sincere , we are unwilling to adhere to the wishes of the parents , ' the appeals court judges wrote			0
the beliefs and convictions of the parents ca n't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child , the court said			1
it also ordered that the guardian should be appointed right away			0
@entity60 , the girl 's father , said the family agreed to begin two years of treatments for @entity15 last spring but stopped in june because it was making her extremely sick			1
@entity15 begged her parents to stop the chemotherapy and they agreed after a great deal of prayer , @entity15 said			1
the family , members of an insular @entity6 community , shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious			0
they live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of @entity75 in @entity76 , about 35 miles southwest of @entity77			0
but hospital officials have said that they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care			0
they said the girl 's illness , lymphoblastic lymphoma , is an aggressive form of non-hodgkin lymphoma , but there is a high survival rate with treatment			2
traditions : @entity15 ( not pictured ) and her family are @entity6 , and their beliefs force them to shun technology and some forms of modern medicine			2
they also did not want to see @entity15 suffer the appeals court noted that a county probate court investigator found that @entity15 is not in remission and will die without chemotherapy			2
the ruling said that while adults can refuse medical treatment regardless of the consequences , children do not have those same rights because of their vulnerability and inability to make critical decisions in a mature manner			0
while state laws give parents a great deal of freedom when it comes to choosing medical treatment for their children , that 's not always true when the decision could be a matter of life or death			2
courts most often will draw the line when doctors think the child 's life is in danger and there 's a good chance that the treatments being suggested will work , according to several medical ethicists .			0
