@entity0 insists complacency will not jeopardise @entity3 ’s preparations for @entity4 as he urged his under - 21 squad to make another statement of intent			1
they will be aiming to secure a 12th consecutive victory under @entity0 on monday night when they travel to @entity11 to face @entity12 in a game the head coach believes will provide another step up in their preparations			1
@entity3 ’s performances have consistently improved this season and their 3 - 1 win against @entity21 last thursday was the particularly satisfying for @entity0 , as it was secured without a number of players who would be considered first - choice starters			1
the @entity26 side will be looking for a 12th consecutive victory under @entity0 @entity0 is confident his players will not get complacent as a result of their impressive form long winning sprees at this level , however , can occasionally provide false hope			1
@entity3 , for instance , went to @entity35 on the back of nine straight victories without conceding a goal only to flop in the tournament , losing all three games in @entity41			1
but @entity0 does not believe a sudden dip will be an issue for this group , as he is certain their preparation — which includes games against the @entity48 and @entity49 next march — will not leave them undercooked for the @entity51			1
‘ we do n’t have ( complacency ) — we certainly would n’t tolerate or allow it , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we ramp up the challenge for them each time and the fixtures will naturally do that			0
we have not got fixtures between now and the summer that will allow us to take our foot off the gas			0
@entity63 ( right ) celebrates scoring for @entity3 against @entity21 at @entity64 last week ‘ competition for places does that also			2
a run like the one we have been on would only give you false hope if you were playing teams like we faced in our group			0
we have covered a lot of things they may face and it will help before we get to the tournament			0
’ @entity0 has a fair idea of which players he will include in his squad next summer and he has again stressed that he will not be looking to flood his 23 - man party with some of the big names that are still eligible for selection			2
the game against @entity21 showed the team can function as @entity0 wants even when key individuals are absent and the performance at @entity64 showed how his methods have been taken on board over the last 15 months			0
‘ that is one of the most pleasing things , really , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ everyone who comes in knows what we want and that is reflected in the players that we pick			0
’ @entity97 wheels away in celebration as the defender , on loan from @entity101 , bags @entity3 's second @entity3 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity104 ; @entity97 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 ; @entity108 , @entity109 ; @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 ; @entity63			1
tv : live on @entity114 , kick - off 8pm .			0
