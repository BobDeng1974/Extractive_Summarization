residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build what would be @entity6 's largest @entity5 cemetery on rural land it means the development - which would include 95 parking spaces for visitors - will become the country 's biggest if it gets the green light			1
the graveyard would be able to comply fully with @entity31 law which states @entity5 are traditionally buried in their own section of land , next to others of the same faith			2
islamic law also stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies before being buried with their heads facing towards @entity42			0
today , residents of the village - which has a population of just 613 - criticised the move and said questioned the need for the cemetery			1
it would mean the facility could eventually hold over 18 times as many people as currently live in the village itself			2
locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic as well as the surrounding greenbelt land			1
@entity62 - of - four @entity63 , 55 , said : ' there is ample room for graves to accommodate the local population here			2

the application was originally withdrawn amid the storm of protest			0
but in july the plans were resubmitted and the second application for an adjacent @entity5 - only cemetery was received by the authority this week			2
both applications are due to go before the planning committee next month			0
conservative councillor @entity92 , for the @entity91 ward of @entity10 , said : ' my main concern is that they are building on the greenbelt land			1
' when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away , but it 's come back with very little adjustment			0
' i understand people 's frustrations			0
' residents say the plans , if given the go ahead will have an impact on the roads in the surrounding area one representative for the @entity109 who has lived in the area for 31 years , but did not want to be named , said : ' there 's no need for it			1
' the borough has sufficient provision for the next 20 years			0
' leader of @entity80 , @entity117 councillor @entity117 , said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met at the borough 's current plots			2
he said : ' there is no need for this extra site in @entity10			1
we have identified our population need and made provision for that			0
' this is an extremely large proposal			0
' obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around @entity9			1
' i do n't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land			2
' the development - which would include 95 parking spaces for visitors - will become the country 's biggest if it gets the green light both cemeteries - which were submitted by different applicants but through the same agent , @entity145 - have received backing from the @entity5 community in @entity10 , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces			1
funeral director @entity152 , of @entity154 - based @entity153 , said even 11,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years			1
he said : ' the local @entity5 population is growing rapidly , but the cemetery @entity5 use is mostly @entity159 which is nearly full			0
' @entity160 are making some provision but we still need more in the vicinity of the population			0
' do n't forget , the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast			0
' before , they used to send people back home to their families in @entity171 and @entity172			0
' but apparently now all their families are here and they have no - one back home			2
' they are saying ' this is our country now			0
' ' we are living here and dying here so we should be buried here			0
