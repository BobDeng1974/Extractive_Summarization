as many as 6.8million people and 1.8million children have been trapped into long - term poverty , the @entity6 says in a report			1
it would mean nearly one in five children are growing up in a workless household – the second highest in @entity15 after @entity16 where it is nearly one in four			1
entrenched unemployment : the @entity20 estate in @entity21 , where around 82 per cent of residents claim benefits the study by the @entity6 – founded by @entity25 before he became @entity26 – said parts of @entity28 in @entity29 were among the worst affected areas			1

their lives have been limited by a fatalistic assumption that they have little prospect of anything better			0
’ the report said : ‘ the vast majority of charities helping the unemployed surveyed ... say that they know of families where two or three generations have no one in work			0
’ the @entity6 said the @entity1 could not afford to delay the government ’s welfare reforms			1
the report authors write : ‘ these arguments are important as the government now spends more than one in every three pounds on welfare			1
’ however , they said there was a greater social rather than financial imperative for reforming welfare			2
‘ by focusing on income transfers rather than employment , our welfare system has made people dependent on benefits , trapping them in poverty and preventing them from achieving economic independence			2
’ handouts : in @entity38 , there are nearly 70 neighbourhoods where 30 per cent of the working age population or higher are claiming unemployment benefit struggling : charities are fighting to keep up with demand for extra services , with around three food banks opening across the @entity1 each week welfare revolution : @entity25 , secretary of state for work and pensions , founded the think tank that wrote the report one of the charities , @entity111 , said that some children do not understand what work is			1
