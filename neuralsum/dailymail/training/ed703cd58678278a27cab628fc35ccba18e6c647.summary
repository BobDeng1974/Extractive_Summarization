by @entity0 last updated at 1:09 pm on 24th october 2011 @entity2 vice-president @entity1 last night refused to rule out the possibility that he might run for the @entity4 in 2016			1
the @entity5 - who will turn 74 in the election month of november 2016 - said that his immediate focus is to help president @entity8 get re-elected in 2012			1
but when pressed on the possibility of his own future run , he replied , ' i 'm not closing anything			2
' eyeing the prize ? @entity1 , pictured with his wife @entity15 and daughter @entity16 on the campaign trail in 2008 , has refused to rule out running for president in 2016 he added : ' my one focus now is getting the president re-elected			1
' and i 'll make up my mind on that [ the 2016 election ] later			2
' the 68 - year - old also said he was in the best shape of his life and was enjoying being in the thick of politics and government			2
mr @entity1 , who ran for president twice before being chosen by mr @entity8 in 2008 as his running mate , is expected to be a key player in the president 's re-election effort next year			1
running mate : mr @entity1 insisted that his immediate priority is to get @entity8 re-elected in november 2012 he is known as a people person and mr @entity8 's political advisers see him as someone who will be particularly effective with working - class voters in key @entity42 battleground states like @entity43 and with older voters in states like @entity46			1
mr @entity1 also has a tendency to make verbal gaffes and stirred controversy last week when he warned that the number of rapes and murders in @entity2 cities would climb if states were forced by budget cuts to lay off police officers			2
the idea of a 74 - year - old @entity1 being inaugurated as @entity2 president in 2016 is n't as far fetched as it sounds			2
in 1981 , @entity58 was inaugurated less than 3 weeks before he turned 70			0
following his re-election in 1984 aged 73 , he eventually left office in january 1989 shortly before turning 78			0
more recently , @entity62 candidate @entity61 , 72 , was beaten by @entity8 in the 2008 presidential race			1
in 1996 , the - then 73 - year - old @entity64 secured the @entity62 nomination to challenge @entity66 for the presidency			0
critics questioned the statistics behind his comment			0
meanwhile , mr @entity8 is today trying to get his re-election campaign back on track as he visits @entity73 to tout his revised jobs bill			1
mr @entity8 will stop in @entity75 - which has the nation 's highest unemployment rate at 13.4 per cent - for a campaign fundraiser at the @entity79			1
he will then visit a poverty - stricken neighbourhood on the city 's far eastern side			0
in his four - hour trip , scheduled to take place between 12pm and 4pm local time , he will talk about the @entity86 that he has put forward to boost his beleaguered country 's economy			0
it would see a $ 447billion combination of fresh spending and tax cuts , offset by tax hikes on the rich			0
the @entity86 was shelved in the @entity95 last week and on friday a plan to finance $ 35billion for states to stop layoffs to teachers and public safety officers was defeated			0
@entity101 are now trying to pass a series of actions , to confront housing , education and other economic problems , in segments under the mantra ' we ca n't wait '			0
the next segment will be $ 50billion in funding and a $ 10billion infrastructure bank to finance roads , bridges , aviation and transit projects			0
mr @entity8 will kick off his new offensive in @entity73 by promoting new rules for federally guaranteed mortgages so that more homeowners , those with little or no equity in their homes , can refinance and avert foreclosure .			1
