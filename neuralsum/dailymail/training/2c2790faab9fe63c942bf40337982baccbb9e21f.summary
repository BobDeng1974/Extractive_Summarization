@entity1 sen. @entity0 told attendees of a @entity4 meet and greet this morning that ' over half the people on disability ' are undeserving and are ' gaming the system			1
' the 2016 presidential hopeful made the remarks while speaking at a breakfast for legislative leaders at @entity12 in @entity13 that was open to the press			1
his speech was videotaped by a @entity17 tracker , and an excerpt containing the remarks on persons claiming to be disabled was posted to @entity21			0
' and what i tell people is , if you look like me , and you hop out of your truck , you should n't be getting a disability check , ' he said			2
continuing , @entity0 told the small group that had gathered to hear him speak , ' over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts			1
' join the club , ' he added , eliciting laughter from his audience			2
' you know , who does n't get up a little anxious for work and their back hurts			1
everybody over 40 has a back pain			0
' in an email sent to reporters the @entity34 said @entity0 's comments were ' eerily reminiscent of @entity64 ’s infamous 2012 “ 47 percent ” remarks			1
' the incident is widely credited with tanking the @entity68 presidential nominee 's odds of beating president @entity69 in the general election			2
while speaking at a private fundraiser , @entity64 claimed that ' there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what ... who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you name it			0
' @entity64 did not know he was being videotaped			0
members of the media were invited to attend @entity0 's event in @entity4 today			1
@entity34 spokesman @entity89 told @entity90 that @entity0 's comments are ' insulting to millions of @entity91 with disabilities			1
' ' they want leaders who will help them get a fair shot , not condescend to them or accuse them of gaming the system , ' @entity89 said			0
' @entity0 has again proven he 's not a new type of @entity68 - when it comes to helping expand opportunity , he 's no better than @entity64			1
' @entity0 did not back away from his earlier remarks in a statement provided to @entity102 on wednesday afternoon			1
' we absolutely should take care of those truly in need of help , ' @entity0 said			0
' but the system is broken , and when people can game the system , they are stealing from those who are truly disabled and wo n't receive the care and aid they need			0
' we must reform the system to ensure that those who really need help receive it			0
' the @entity1 senator is in @entity4 today meeting with various local activists , business owners and politicians while his colleagues in the @entity124 travel to to @entity125 , @entity126 , for a party pow wow			0
they 'll be joined at the retreat by @entity129 later this afternoon			0
throughout the past several months @entity0 has added seasoned operatives to his political action committee all while playing coy about his 2016 plans			2
@entity0 has not formally announced a presidential campaign but his hiring of a campaign manager on tuesday signaled his intentions , and an official campaign launch is expected to come in the spring .			2

' there 's always somebody who 's deserving , and everybody in this room knows somebody who 's gaming the system , ' @entity0 said
the 2016 presidential hopeful then said , ' over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts . join the club '
@entity0 did not back away from his comments in a statement to @entity102 and *advocated* for reforms to the system
