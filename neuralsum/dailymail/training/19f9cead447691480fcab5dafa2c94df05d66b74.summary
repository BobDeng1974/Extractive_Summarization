@entity0 : @entity1 : host commentator that rather meandered along in the second half but @entity5 will be delighted			1
@entity1 - thanks to substitute @entity7 's late goal - have recorded back - to - back victories at the @entity9 for the first time in their history			1
@entity13 had levelled earlier from the spot after @entity15 gave @entity1 the lead , but @entity0 never got a head of steam			1
problems for @entity20 going forward			1
click the link above to read @entity23 's full match report			2
into stoppage time ... only two minutes ! ! @entity25 should 've finished it ! did @entity27 a kipper down the right but only fires int the sidenetting ! big , big chance			0
suarez yellow card after bringing down @entity34			0
are we to get a quality ball in ? @entity37 ... and @entity38 wanders out to collect			0
@entity40 has a yellow to his name now as @entity0 push forward ... free - kick on the edge of the box , right - hand side			1
@entity48 must step up and deliver			0
clipped in with no conviction			0
booking for @entity34 now as the visitors stand over a decent set piece here			1
83mins : @entity13 now shooting from anywhere			1
desperate for @entity0 , this , and @entity1 will just throw bodies in front of those efforts			1
if @entity1 manage to hang on for the next ten minutes it 'll be the first time ever they 've won consecutive league matches at the @entity9			1
real look to be lacking ideas here , worryingly for @entity20			1
good area on the right			0
needs a delivery ... but @entity37 ' centre is palmed away by @entity38			0
well , i did say it suited @entity1 and it 's @entity7 who 's put the visitors back in front ! a nice stepover by @entity71 inside the box and the substitute sweeps into the far corner			1
wonderful , wonderful passed finish			0
those 50 ( yes , fifty ) travelling fans are delirious			0
this has opened up somewhat , which suits @entity1 on the counter you would 've thought			1
and @entity7 again ! @entity83 's whipped cross is n't met by the substitute and @entity85 heads over for a corner			2
chance ! @entity7 cuts in from the left , opens his body up and just drives wide ! 72mins : here comes @entity91 , replacing the largely ineffectual @entity92			1
into the final 20 minutes now and we 've barely had a chance after the break			0
i wo n't lie , this has disappointed me since eight o'clock			0
and how @entity98 picks up a yellow card			0
this is ridiculous ! seven for the night			0
@entity98 , by the way , scored on his debut for his previous two clubs			0
@entity85 in the book now ! it 's not been that kind of game really			1
changes : @entity98 on for @entity109 and @entity25 is on for @entity110			0
real panic stations with @entity112 at the back who hacks for a needless corner			0
@entity116 gets above his marker - @entity27 , incidentally - at the back post but nods over			2
chance for @entity92 but his header floats into @entity38 's arms			1
@entity48 's centre was too drifty and behind @entity92			1
meanwhile , @entity7 is coming on for the booked @entity121			0
a little bit niggly here			0
@entity1 trying to slow the game down , but they have a free - kick in an advantageous position			1
ah , but it comes to nothing			0
they are n't potent enough , with @entity129 not wining enough in the air			1
54mins : booking for @entity121 , who tactically hauls down @entity48 as he rampaged on the counter			0
bit of territory for @entity1 now			2
@entity83 launches a throw - in towards the six - yard box but the hosts easily clear			2
51mins : and there 's another from way out - this time from @entity27 - that flies over			2
47mins : first shot in anger during this second half and it comes from @entity48 who blasts over from 30 yards			0
right , here we go			0
will @entity1 come out more ? they kick us back off and clear to touch			2
the referee has blown slightly early there			0
anyway , @entity15 gave @entity1 the lead with a superb near post header early doors before @entity13 bought - then scored - a penalty to level it up			1
@entity0 have been guilty of missing a number of opportunities and should be leading here			2
@entity1 have - somewhat disappointingly - sat in and absorbed too much pressure here			1
was expecting them to come out a little bit more			0
@entity129 in the book for a late one in midfield as @entity0 win a corner			1
@entity27 tries to steer towards the back post but nothing comes of it , despite @entity13 's best efforts			1
they 're getting closer though ... @entity109 tries to make amends for that fluff before but slides an effort wide after nicely cutting inside on the edge			0
ca n't have helped that half the @entity9 were jeering him as he shaped to shoot			2
horrible touch @entity109 ! @entity13 streams forward on the left , plays in the @entity172 who has all the time in the word but he miscontrols and @entity38 is out to thwart him			2
well , i expected real to flood forward after the goal but it 's been a fairly subdued five minutes or so			0
@entity13 does n't miss many , and he sends @entity38 the wrong way to level it up			2
game on ! @entity13 goes over the challenge of @entity181 and it 's given ! could barely hear the whistle and it 's barely a foul			1
think @entity13 has bought that			2
@entity116 hauls down @entity13 on the edge and picks up a booking for his troubles			2
good area this ... ronaldo over it			0
oh , no ! it 's @entity92 ! and what a save by @entity38 , diving to his left to deny the @entity197			1
poor from @entity121 , who gives away the ball in his own third , but @entity0 can not capitalise - largely because two or three defenders then harry to win back possession			1
tame header is comfortably saved			0
the @entity9 is a touch restless			2
@entity48 is in the book for protesting after not being awarded what appeared to be a clear free - kick on the edge			0
@entity83 marauds down the right and earns a corner			0
can @entity0 defend ? they struggle again but @entity109 eventually hooks away			2
very nervy at the back			0
chance for @entity48 - teed up by @entity13 - but he ca n't direct a tricky volley towards goal			1
the @entity215 struck it into the ground and it bounces harmlessly over			0
you fancy that @entity0 need a quick reply			2
14mins : @entity13 looks a touch miffed at that early goal , drives at the away area , but flashes an effort over the top			2
good from @entity181 down the left ... corner ... and goal ! @entity228 was ignored at the near post - @entity229 , @entity109 and @entity13 the guilty parties - and he nods home from a wicked @entity233 delivery			1
first bit of work for @entity236 , who plucks a @entity233 cross out of the air confidently			0
different goalkeeper this season ! @entity1 are superb at pressing high and forcing mistakes			1
we 've seen that already as the visitors turn possession over in @entity0 's third			1
this is not only one of the biggest clashes in @entity249 , but on the continent now			0
i was lucky enough to be in @entity252 for the @entity254 final a few months ago and you do n't realise how much this particular fixture means until you sample it first - hand			0
so here we go at the @entity9 , @entity0 get us underway ... well done all			1
@entity236 ; @entity85 , @entity27 , @entity112 , @entity229 ; @entity34 , @entity37 , @entity48 ; @entity92 , @entity13 , @entity109 @entity38 , @entity258 , @entity181 , @entity15 , @entity233 , @entity71 , @entity129 , @entity259 , @entity121 , @entity83 , @entity40 good evening and welcome to @entity261 's coverage of the @entity1 derby			1
this should be exceptionally fiesty - ca n't wait ! follow @entity261 's live coverage from @entity265 as @entity0 host local rivals @entity1 at the @entity9			1
@entity5 's men pipped the hosts to the title last season but both sides are already playing catch - up to @entity273 , who recorded their third consecutive win against @entity276 earlier in the day			1
@entity13 looks set to start for @entity20 's side after overcoming an ankle injury , while @entity129 is looking for his second goal for @entity280 after netting the winner against @entity282 last time out .			1

@entity13 equalises from the penalty spot
@entity15 gives @entity265 champions the lead at the @entity9 as @entity13 returns
@entity0 host @entity1 at the @entity9 on *saturday* evening
@entity13 looks set to return for @entity20 's side
@entity92 fit to play after helping @entity294 beat @entity295 on *tuesday*
@entity0 have won one and lost one so far this season
@entity5 's men beat newly - promoted @entity282 2 - 1 in their last game
*summer* *signing* @entity129 should lead the line for the visitors
