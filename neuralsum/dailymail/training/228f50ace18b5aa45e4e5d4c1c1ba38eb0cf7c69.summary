by @entity0 published : 08:18 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 16 august 2013 next year will be the tenth anniversary of the @entity3 tsunami that claimed 230,000 lives			0
it will be a poignant date for brothers @entity6 and @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , - as it was the last time they saw their parents , @entity13 and @entity14			1
but it is also the date when they hope to open a children 's home in @entity19 , the product of years of hard work to build something positive out of their family tragedy			1
the family were caught up in the natural disaster while they were staying in @entity28 in 2004			1
@entity6 and @entity8 , then aged 17 and 15 respectively , survived by clinging on to the roof of a building when the giant wave hit the coastline			1
the orphans were left with nothing and had to hitchhike across the devastated country to make it back to @entity55 where they would be cared for by their extended family and friends			0
but rather than being broken by the tragedy , the brothers decided to do something positive to honour the memory of their mother and father and help other orphaned children around the world			2
taking inspiration from their philanthropist parents , who had given up their jobs in the fashion industry to volunteer for humanitarian projects , the pair designed flip flops made from natural materials with a woven rope style			1
best foot forward : their initial design , left , used natural materials before they changed to rubber with more vibrant colours fan : sir @entity84 stocks the flip flops on his island and wears them himself in style : @entity89 , left , and @entity90 have stepped out in @entity92 flip flops under the brand name @entity96 , sales of the flips flops funds their ' orphans for @entity100 ' initiative			1
their goal is to raise enough money to open their first children 's home by the end of next year in @entity19			1
so far their enterprise has also funded a teacher and a nurse in @entity110 for a year and bought school supplies for over 100 children in @entity113			0
@entity6 , now 25 , told the @entity114 : ' we travelled the world with our parents as they carried out volunteer work			2
they wanted to quit the rat race to experience other cultures and make a difference			0
' they sold our family home in @entity126 and took my brothers and sister and i out of school and we moved initially to @entity110			0
' we 'd been travelling for three years when we became orphans ourselves and we wanted to do something positive			2
from humble beginnings : the brothers ' bedroom in @entity136 where the business started to tweets from the stars : @entity140 loves the flip flops and posted this picture ' we wanted to build a brand based on our beliefs and family values with the target of opening our first children 's home in @entity19 on the tenth anniversary of the tsunami			1
' starting out from their bedroom in @entity136 , the flip flop design evolved to be made from rubber while still incorporating the distinctive pleated toe bar			0
they have men and women 's styles with vibrant colours and patterns			0
thanks to the brothers hard work and marketing skills , the flip flops are now being stocked by @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 ( where they sold out after first going on sale ) among other well - known shoe stores			2
trip of a lifetime : @entity6 and @entity8 had been travelling the world with their parents and younger brother and sister when they were caught up in the tsunami ' she would have been proud ' : @entity6 and @entity48 with their mother @entity14 they have also garnered a celebrity following with sir @entity84 ( who now stocks them on his island ) , @entity188 and @entity89 being pictured wearing them			1
numerous other stars have tweeted their support for the brand from @entity140 to @entity193			2
@entity6 said : ' we 're amazed about how far we 've gotten in such a short time ; we really could n't believe it when we got told that we 'd sold out in @entity169			0
' @entity8 , 23 , added : ' we 've still got a lot of work to do before we can open our first children 's home next year but we know that our parents would be proud of how much we 've achieved already			1
