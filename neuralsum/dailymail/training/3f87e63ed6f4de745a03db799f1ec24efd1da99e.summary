the company would then launch a larger 5.7 - inch model shortly afterwards			0
@entity5 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity102 , and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its @entity7			1
concept images have emerged that show @entity5 's next - generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis			1
this concept , by @entity39 - based firm set solution , predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom , in order to retain the home button by comparison , @entity5 's current @entity78 , pictured , has a depth of 7.6mm			1

the first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the ' @entity33 ' - will be 4.5mm thick , while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom			0
by comparison , @entity5 ’s current @entity78 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity102 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			2

in order to make the @entity5 phone super-thin , @entity173 's concept - dubbed @entity33 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls @entity5 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity102 , pictured , which was 20 % thinner than previous models @entity188 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			1
it also appears taller than @entity173 ’s version in order to fit the larger screen			0
@entity5 ’s @entity7 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity78 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			1
@entity5 ’s ceo @entity203 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			2
however , with main rivals @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity209 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity5 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			1
last november , designer @entity216 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity7 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			1
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			0
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			0
according to @entity235 journalist @entity234 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity5 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			2
