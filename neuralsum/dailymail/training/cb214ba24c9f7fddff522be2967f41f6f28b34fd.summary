by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 04:10 est , 6 march 2014 @entity3 's wildy romantic fairytale show in @entity4 may have had fashion fans under a spell but it 's bound to rile animal lovers			2
from hand - cut fur pom poms to hooded fur gilets , the fashion house 's @entity8 was almost entirely made up of the controversial material			1
designer @entity14 , who came to the attention of the wider public after designing the former @entity18 's wedding dress , sent her models down the runway as fairy - tale heroines roaming a make - believe forest with their fur - embellished gowns trailing behind them			1
by swathing her models in super-sized hooded fur coats , @entity38 made it clear that fur is back on the fashion agenda for @entity8			1
this is a stark contrast to the late @entity45 when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a mink - trimmed cuff			2
@entity50 ( @entity50 ) was born and in 1994 five supermodels posed nude to protest against wearing fur , along with the slogan ' i 'd rather go naked than wear fur			2
' this campaign has run and run and was most recently fronted by @entity57			0
such was public disgust , those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves splattered with red paint ( or a dead raccoon in @entity66 's case )			0
but these good intentions did n't last long and slowly , fur crept back into fashion			1
even the eyelashes are furry ! a model showcases a furry jacket from @entity3 's collection fur overload ! models in super-sized hooded fur coats made their way down the runway back in fashion ? @entity38 made it clear that fur is back on the fashion agenda for @entity8 what a difference a few years makes : the show was a stark contrast to the late @entity45 when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a minktrimmed cuff behind the scenes , the fur industry is fighting back , encouraged , it seems , by fashion 's most influential - such as @entity93 and @entity94 - who trot out draped in the stuff			1
so is fur back in fashion and will we all be wearing it come autumn ? no , say @entity50 [ @entity50 ] , who point to a recent @entity101 poll which found that 95 per cent of @entity103 women say they would n't wear fur			1
' fashion designers should be forward - thinking innovators			2
in contrast , parading animal pelts down the catwalk is simply archaic , ' said a spokesman			2
' @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are just some of the designers that shun fur and instead work with luxurious , exciting , sophisticated , cruelty - free fabrics , from metals to spun acrylic and satin , and we hope to see @entity38 embrace new cutting - edge fabrics that do n't bleed			1
in this day and age , there 's absolutely no reason for animals to be killed for fashion			0
' ' i wonder how many animals had to die for @entity134 and @entity94 ’s wardrobes			1
they might be chart toppers , but they ’re also barbarians ' fashion blogger @entity138 was appalled by what he saw on the catwalk			2
he said : ' i actually gasped out loud when i trawled through the catwalk shots from @entity14 ’s latest @entity3 adventure			1
not out of joy , but of sheer horror at the amount of fur she decided to use			2
' the collection is named ‘ @entity36 ’ – but i ’m inclined to add an – ly onto the end of the latter			0
do these designers just turn a blind eye to the fur industry ? do they just think it happens to fall off the animals in a glorious , gift - giving way like apples dropping from their branches ? ' i realise there are those customers who demand fur , who love to wrap themselves up in the stuff , but it ’s down to the labels and editors ( yes , you @entity66 ! ) to stop this happening			1
you can do glamour without skinning foxes and mink alive – just look to @entity111 or brilliant faux fur label , @entity174			2
i imagine if these fashion houses decided to turn around imitation fur pieces too , they ’d sell like hotcakes			0
fur , fur , everywhere : the collection is named ' @entity36 ' - but i 'm inclined to add an - ly onto the end of the latter , says @entity138 ' you can bet your bottom dollar that the @entity18 wo n’t be seen in any furry @entity3 creations , she might even stay clear of the label altogether now			1
and i would n’t blame her			0
mr and mrs @entity191 love a bit of fur , and i wonder how many animals had to die for @entity134 and @entity94 ’s wardrobes			1
they might be chart toppers , but they ’re also barbarians			0
' celebrity stylist @entity198 added : ' unfortunately , it does not surprise me one bit that there is fur on the @entity3 catwalk			1
it 's everywhere and is not just reserved for autumn			0
this @entity205 , @entity206 have shaved mink dresses and the @entity209 catwalk is full of fur - and that ’s for the hot summer months ! ' gone are the days of supermodels posing for anti-fur campaigns with slogans such as " i 'd rather go naked than wear fur "			1
@entity218 was deemed non-pc but now that rule has been totally sidelined			0
fur seems to have been made not only fashionable but to be the ultimate in luxury by the design houses			0
wrapping up warm : supermodel of the moment @entity227 can often be spotted wearing her fur - trimmed hood coat @entity229 ? @entity230 once posed in favour of anti-fur but seems to have changed her mind remember when ... ? @entity234 also seems to be an avid fan of fur goods despite once posing for @entity50 big fan : @entity94 has no qualms about her penchant for fur coats and often sports fur stoles too generation cruel ? @entity243 , @entity93 and @entity191 have all been spotted wearing fur coats - even though @entity191 's sister @entity244 is the face of @entity50 's anti-fur campaign ' as a passionate animal lover , i find this very hard to stomach			1
i find it absolutely shocking that fur is being so accepted and is now trimmed on nearly every parka or winter coat you see on the high street			0
' there are some seriously good faux fur available now , especially from @entity174 ( sold on @entity259 ) which is the ultimate in cool and does n’t hurt a soul			0
of course it does n’t help that celebrities such as @entity191 , @entity93 and @entity264 wear fur			1
' if only they could see how it does n’t need to be real to be on trend - see how good @entity270 and @entity271 look - you ca n't even tell it is n't the real thing			0
' encouragingly , several industry heavyweights all refuse to use fur in their collections			0
@entity111 is one designer for whom pelts just do n't pay , telling @entity279 that : ' everything in my store and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here			0
' and she 's not alone			0
sir @entity296 's @entity295 , which includes @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 , as well as @entity301 , @entity290 , @entity112 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 have all pledged not to sell fur			0
even prestigious @entity305 haunt and celebrity nightspot @entity303 has vowed to turn away anyone wearing fur at the door - proving that you can have a look that kills without killing animals			1
wrapped up : @entity311 sports a fur hat to watch the races during the @entity314			0

there were hand - cut fur pom poms and hooded fur gilets on the @entity8 catwalk
is @entity14 trying to bring fur back despite the *nationwide* hatred for it a few short years *ago* ?
