surely we ’d welcome @entity1 back to @entity2 with open arms ? in full - flight , there ’s no more awesome sight in @entity8 football than the @entity9			1
until , that is , he falls flat on his face under little or no contact with an opposing defender			2
well , that ’s @entity1			1
a quite brilliant football player one moment , and a shame to the game the next			2
rightly , or wrongly , diving is now part of football			2
and while @entity1 is one of the world ’s best players , he ’s also one of the planet ’s expert divers			1
the way he flails his arms about with a face that suggests he ’s just been hit by a bus is not befitting of a man so highly talented with a ball at his feet			0
penalty : referee @entity42 awarded @entity43 a spot - kick after @entity45 appeared to catch @entity1 full flight : @entity1 falls to the deck inside the @entity16 box to win his side a late penalty in their last - 16 clash his latest @entity53 impression came in yesterday ’s thrilling 2 - 1 @entity55 second round win over @entity16			1
@entity1 insists @entity16 skipper @entity45 ’s did make contact with him in the split seconds leading up to his theatrical fall in the box to earn @entity43 ’s decisive injury time penalty			1
but @entity16 boss @entity61 was n’t having any of it			2
‘ today it was not a wonderful goal that put us out , it was bad decision by the referee , an invented penalty , ’ said the manager			0
‘ it seems to me that the reason we were eliminated was the man with the whistle			0
if the referee invents a penalty of that size , you leave the @entity55 after circumstances not created by you			0
‘ and @entity1 dived three times for penalties that did n’t exist			1
he should have been cautioned			0
if you do that to the guy who tries to cheat , then he ca n’t cheat again			0
’ daley-esque : the @entity86 screams as he throws himself into the air as @entity88 dives in to a tackle dramatic : @entity1 begins falling to the floor inside the penalty area while playing for @entity93 and while @entity1 is keen to stress that @entity95 was correct in pointing to the spot , the @entity9 himself admitted that he tried to con the referee against @entity16			1
‘ that one was a penalty , but the other in the first half was a dive			0
’ he confession at trying to deceive into officials into awarding his side a free - kick just outside the @entity109 penalty area leaves bitter taste			0
for all intents and purposes , it ’s cheating			0
do we want cheaters in the @entity116 ? most certainly not			1
for every elegant fake or drop of the shoulder , there would be a theatrical fall in the box to earn his side an unfair advantage			0
outrage : @entity126 boss @entity125 labelled @entity1 ' a very good diver ' in march we already have a big enough problem in combating diving in our game without @entity133 ’s premier diver adding to the problem			1
and it ’s not like yesterday ’s dive was n’t an isolated incident			0
he was accused of diving against @entity126 in the @entity140 last summer ; @entity125 calling him a ‘ very good diver ’ in march			1
there other such instances to throw at him			0
for that reason - and that reason alone - @entity1 is not welcome back on these shores			2
his skill with the ball at this feet would light up the @entity116 , his diving would plunge it into darkness .			1

the @entity43 speed *merchant* has been linked with @entity152
but the @entity93 *attacker* *'s* *reputation* for diving means he is unlikely to ever return to the @entity116
in march , @entity126 boss @entity125 said @entity1 was ' a very good diver '
