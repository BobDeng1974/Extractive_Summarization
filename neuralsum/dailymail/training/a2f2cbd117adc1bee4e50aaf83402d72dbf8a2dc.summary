@entity17 was adjudged to have brought down @entity18 in the area late in the match @entity21 dives to his left but is unable to keep out @entity8 's late , controversially awarded , penalty @entity0 have every right to feel aggrieved at the loss of two points in @entity27 as a @entity29 referee showed that he is no better than a couple of @entity14 referees who gave poor penalties last weekend			1
no matter how many times i watch replays of the 86th - minute challenge by @entity17 ( left ) i can not understand why a penalty was awarded			0
