but walkers have been warned to take care when walking along a stretch of the famous @entity12 after tonnes of chalk crashed into the @entity15 when part of the cliff - face sheared off			1
a giant mound of clay was left on the shore near @entity21 after the collapse between between @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25			1
landslide : tonnes of chalk were left piled on the @entity25 coastline after part of the @entity12 collapsed warning signs : the collapse happened in @entity21 between @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25 , and the @entity32 has now put up signs telling walkers to beware further collapses in the area @entity36 said a bench and fencing which sat on the cliff - top were also sent tumbling to the base , prompting warnings to coastal walkers			1
fortunately , no one was hurt			2
the collapse is thought to have been caused by a combination of high winds and rain freezing after being absorbed into the chalk and then expanding , causing the cliff to weaken			1
a similar collapse saw a chunk of the cliff - face slip in march last year			2
a @entity36 spokesman said : ' there was a similar fall in 2012 but this one is smaller than that one			2
a bench and fence have gone down with it			0
rubble : @entity32 , which owns the stretch of land said that the collapse was smaller than a similar one last march ' coastguard rescue officers were tasked to make an assessment of the area and take some pictures which were sent off to the relevant authorities			1
' the cliff - fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level , and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high			1
' on a clear day you can see right across from the @entity23 cliffs to the cliffs on the @entity79 coast at @entity80 , proof of the continuous strata of chalk			1
about 70million years ago this part of @entity85 was submerged by a shallow sea			0
the sea bottom was made of a white mud formed from the fragments of coccoliths - the skeletons of tiny algae which floated in the surface waters of the sea			0
this mud became the chalk			0
it is believed to have been deposited very slowly , probably only half a millimetre a year			0
in spite of this , up to 500 metres of chalk were deposited in places			0
the coccoliths are too small to be seen without a microscope but if you look carefully you can find fossils of some of the larger inhabitants of the chalk sea such as sponges , shells , ammonites and urchins			0
( source : @entity114 ) @entity32 , which owns the land , were told of the collapse and have put up signs warning walkers to beware			1
a @entity32 spokesman said : ' this cliff fall is part of a process of natural regeneration that happens on this world famous stretch of the @entity25 coast , helping to keep this special place , recognised by millions across the world , so distinctive			1
' we ’ve installed signs and information to help keep access open to this @entity5 icon			2
' throughout the year we closely monitor how the elements affect the chalk cliffs , helping us to manage the coastal footpath			0
' the @entity25 landmark , immortalised by @entity139 ’s wartime song @entity138 , has suffered large falls before , and is thought to recede by around half an inch each year			1
experts believe that the cliffs could move up to 200 yards further away from @entity79 by the end of the century			0
parts of the cliffs are now supported by concrete			0
the chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in @entity151 history , including the first arrival of the @entity153 and the return of @entity5 forces rescued from @entity156 in the @entity157			0
they are also home to a rich array of wildlife such as the @entity163 blue butterfly and peregrine falcons , @entity25 ’s only kittiwake , and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots			1
last year , the @entity32 , which owns five miles of the white cliffs , successfully raised money to buy a mile of the coastline from a private owner in a campaign backed by celebrities including @entity175 , singer @entity176 and chef @entity177			1
more than 16,000 people and organisations backed the appeal , which was launched in june last year and saw an average donation of £ 40.21 , including @entity182 , from members of the public			0
collapse : the cliff - fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level , and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high famous : the @entity12 are an iconic symbol of @entity5 freedom and independence and were the inspiration for one of the most famous wartime songs by @entity139			2
