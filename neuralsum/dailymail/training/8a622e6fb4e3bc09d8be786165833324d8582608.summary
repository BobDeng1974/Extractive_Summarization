cyber insecurity : @entity1 , a security consultant for organizations like the @entity3 and @entity4 , has a forthcoming book about how technology may give the upper hand to criminals it is n't just researchers finding applications for brain scanning and artificial intelligence , but rather criminals who may be able to exploit these emerging technologies faster than they can be secured			1
a new book from security consultant @entity1 called @entity17 exposes the possible threats that a technologically advanced future poses			1
' i could see a horrific scenario wherein somebody is kidnapped and threatened that unless they pay an exorbitant sum , their lifelong memories of their wife or daughter would be erased , ' @entity1 told @entity28			2
' we 're a long way away ' from that scenario , according to @entity1 , a @entity31 , which publishes @entity28 , though technology like neuropharmeceuticals , which the @entity34 is exploring to minimize traumatic brain activity caused by @entity36 , make it a possibility in the future			1
having also consulted for law enforcement organizations like @entity4 as well as the @entity3 , @entity1 cautions that criminals may be among the first adopters of emerging technologies			1
one particular area of concern for @entity1 is the advancement of artificial intelligence , the ability of computers to perform traditional cognitive functions such as reason , learn and plan			1
' we ’re using ai every day , ' says @entity1			2
' whether it ’s in our gps devices , in our @entity54 recommendations , what we see on our @entity57 status updates and streams — all of that is controlled via @entity50			0
' but even these forms of ' narrow ' artificial intelligence could be pressed into service by criminals , and @entity1 points out one instance where @entity66 was used to help cover up a murder			1
' in one case , a @entity69 student was accused of killing his college roommate for dating his girlfriend , ' said @entity1			2
' what does he do with the dead body before him ? ' ' he had never murdered anybody before , and he had no idea how to dispose of the body			0
so , he asked @entity66			0
the answers @entity66 returned ? mine , swamp , and open field , among others			0
' other existing technology that is growing more sophisticated , like @entity85 headsets , could also be utilized for criminal activity			0
infiltration : cyber criminals could find a way to insert malware that could access an @entity85 headset , like the @entity91 , pictured with its developer edition device , which could be used to scan for personal info a study by researchers from @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 in 2012 found electroencephalogram devices , which measure the electrical activity in the brain , could be used to steal banking information			1
the study found that just by showing an image of a pin pad to a person strapped to an @entity85 headset , an attacker revealed the victim 's pin 20 % of the time , much better than random chance			0
while the term ' cyber @entity111 ' has been tossed around as a way to warn about the grave risks associated with not improving the @entity117 ' electronic security , @entity1 has argued that a ' cyber @entity118 ' is really what is needed			1
the convergence of public and private expertise , like the effort that led to the development of nuclear devices , could lead to technology that secures computers against increasingly frequent attacks			0
@entity1 writes that computer systems at banks and major retailers like @entity131 and @entity132 that were attacked over the last couple years , as well critical infrastructure are vulnerable			2
' we ’ve wired the world , but failed to secure it , ' @entity1 said .			0

security adviser @entity1 predicted criminals will exploit technology like artificial intelligence and brain scanning
his forthcoming book , @entity17 , examines the state of security *architecture* and the change electronic threats posed by criminals
@entity1 , who has advised @entity150 and @entity4 , has called for a cyber ' @entity118 '
