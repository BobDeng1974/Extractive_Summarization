by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 8 july 2013 for those who live in fear of our eight - legged friends , it 's the stuff of nightmares			1
engineers in @entity8 have made a robotic spider that accurately replicates the creepy leg movements of real arachnids			2
the @entity13 robot contains 26 little motors under its @entity16 printed case to make the spider move in a way that will certainly scare those terrified of the creatures			1
the @entity16 printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called @entity38			2
the means that the master of the octopod does not have to send the robot intricate instructions			2
using a wireless controller , an individual can select a gait and tell the spider in which direction to travel , making it ideal for stealth attacks and pranks			0
the engine handles all the complex mathematical theory and calculations required to control a multi-legged walking robot , leaving the operator free to focus on what it actually wants the spider to do			1
for example , a user can tell the spider to walk forward at a certain speed , while the engine takes care of detail such as inverse kinematics , leg trajectory planning and motor control			0
the company selling the robot says : ' this makes it quite easy even for absolute beginners to play with advanced robotics			0
' the @entity16 printed spiderbot is powered by a microcontroller that runs a movement engine called @entity38			0
it handles all the complex maths needed to control a multi-legged walking robot so the user only has to issue simple instructions unlike the @entity82 robot , real tarantulas ( pictured ) come in over 900 varieties and it is thought that they produce small quantities of silk from their feet , enabling them to cling to smooth surfaces owners of the scary toy may want to refrain from shocking a friend with arachnophobia and a good aim though , as the robotic mini beast costs over £ 900			1
the robot is the brainchild of a research , engineering and design company called @entity101 in @entity8 , which specialises in making innovative robotics systems			2
it is on sale from the @entity13 website that creates bio-inspired multi-legged robots and is expected to ship in september			0
luckily , for those who want more terror for their money there is a slightly less - realistic six - legged robot available for just over £ 160			1
the @entity112 is a hexapod version of the @entity82 that contains 18 motors instead of 26 , so there are still three in each leg			1
as there are no motors in the insect critter 's body , it ca n't pose like it 's spider peer , but still uses the same engine to move around in a realistic way			1
both scary products come as kits and need to be built			0
the controllers cost extra but there is scope for technophiles to create their own communication methods with the robots as they are open devices			0
users of spider bot can choose between pre-programming their own sequences or directly controlling the robot in real time with the wireless @entity138 .			0

the @entity82 robo - tarantula has 26 motors under a 3d - printed shell to move in a super realistic way
engineers in @entity8 created the £ 900 octopod , which *includes* a *clever* engine to do the complex maths required to make the mini *monster* move
a smaller , *cheaper* six - legged robot is also available for techie *prangsters*
