by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 13:06 est , 15 november 2012 this incredible picture shows a dying sun which has burst back to life for a final , doomed blaze of glory			1
the perishing star - which was once like our own @entity8 - has burst briefly back to life after casting gassy shells out into the surrounding space			1
the image of the planetary nebula @entity14 is a composite of visible images from the @entity19 / @entity18 @entity17 and x-ray data from @entity18 ’s @entity21 and @entity19 ’s @entity23 space telescopes			1
@entity14 30 : this born - again planetary nebula shows how our own @entity8 may one day look as it burns out it is 5,500 light years from @entity27 , but mimics the possible fate our own solar system faces in a few billion years			1
' planetary nebula ' is the name given to the often - concentric shells of stellar material cast into space by dying stars like this one			1
the intricate pattern of planetary nebula @entity14 30 revealed in the picture above combines optical @entity17 ( @entity17 ) images with @entity21 and @entity23 x-ray data			1
in the main image a large spherical shell is seen in emission of hydrogen ( blue ) and oxygen ( red ) as the result of the star ’s outer shell being stripped off by a dense wind and expanding outward over the last 12 500 years			2
during the ‘ born - again ’ phase in the star ’s evolution , it expelled knots of helium and carbon - rich material			0
a subsequent fast wind is streaming past this material to form the flower - like structure seen in oxygen emission ( red ) to produce shock - heated gas seen in @entity66 ( purple )			0
the inset panel zooms in to the heart of the planetary nebula to reveal intricate details closer to the star			2
the tail - like structures ( orange ) mark the dense knots of material from the ‘ born - again ’ event and are seen in @entity17 images			0
x-ray emission from this evolutionary phase is shown in purple			0
to astronomers of the 18th century , these objects looked like the colourful ‘ blob ’ of a planet through their telescopes , and the name has stuck			0
now scientists know that as a star with less than eight times the mass of the @entity8 swells into a red giant towards the end of its life , its outer layers are expelled via pulsations and winds			2
ultraviolet radiation shining out from the stripped - down , but still hot stellar core then lights up the ejected shells , resulting in intricate artwork - like phenomena that can be seen by modern telescopes			2
a ‘ homeless planet ’ which floats through space without orbiting a star had been discovered for the first time			0
scientists have speculated on the existence of such a planet and have been trawling the night skies for more than a decade , although the hunt was described as looking for a ‘ needle in a thousand haystacks ’			0
the isolated planet , shown below in an artist 's impression , which astronomers believe may have been flung away during its formation , is not tied by gravity to a star and in 100 light years away			1
the star at the heart of @entity14 experienced its first brush with death 12,500 years ago – as seen from @entity27 – when its outer shell was stripped off by a slow and dense stellar wind			1
optical telescopes see the remnant of this evolutionary stage as a large , near - spherical shell of glowing material expanding out into space			0
then , about 850 years ago , the star suddenly came back to life , violently coughing out knots of helium and carbon - rich material			2
the star ’s outer envelope briefly expanded during this born - again episode , but then very rapidly contracted again within 20 years			2
this had the knock - on effect of accelerating the wind from the star to its present speed of 4,000 kilometres per second – over 14million kilometres per hour ( 8.7million miles per hour )			0
as this fast stellar wind catches up and interacts with the slower wind and clumps of previously ejected material , complex structures are formed , including the delicate comet - like tails seen near the star in the centre of this image			0
the stellar wind bombarding these dense clumps of material provides a chilling look at the possible fate of @entity27 and its fellow planets in our own solar system in a few billion years ’ time			1
when our @entity8 emits its final gasps of life at the heart of a planetary nebula , its strong stellar wind and harsh radiation will blast and evaporate any planets that may have survived the red giant phase of stellar evolution			1
if any distant civilisation is watching with high - power telescopes at the time , they might see the glowing embers of the planets light up in @entity66 as they are engulfed in the stellar wind .			0

planetary nebula @entity14 30 has burst briefly back into life after casting gassy shells out into surrounding space
5,500 light years from @entity27 , it 's fate mimics that which probably awaits our own solar system in a few billion years
