@entity8 believes @entity42 never would have wanted @entity13 to be a part of reality television and she ca n’t quite grasp why anyone would want to be a on a television show with women fighting and getting drunk , ’ an unidentified source close to the 80 - year - old socialite told @entity23			1
‘ fortunately , she lives in @entity69 and that puts some distance between her and the sensational headlines			0
