by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 published : 07:18 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 10:18 est , 13 march 2014 @entity5 is preparing to face down demands to increase the 40p tax rate which has hit an extra 1million workers since the coalition was formed			1
the chancellor is under growing pressure to stop dragging more middle - class earners into the tax bracket which was once targeted at the wealthy			1
workers now get hit with the 40p rate when they earn £ 41,450 a year			1
but with a rise to £ 44,000 costing the @entity17 £ 1.5billion , mr @entity5 is expected to instead to turn focus his focus on lower earners in next week 's budget			2
by freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate , the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition chancellor @entity5 is expected to focus his attention on low earners in next week 's budget the flagship @entity28 tax policy has been to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax at all , and will reach £ 10,000 in april this year			1
but to help pay for it , mr @entity5 has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start paying the 40p rate			2
in 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £ 43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate			2
but this year the threshold has fallen to £ 41,450 , which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate			1
in 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate			0
critics say the higher rate is no longer faced only by the ‘ highly paid few ’ but hitting middle earners like teachers , nurses and small businesses			1
the national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £ 6.50 later this year , giving more than a million workers a pay rise			2
the rate for 18 to 20 - year - olds will go up by 10p to £ 5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase			0
for 16 and 17 - year - olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to @entity58 , also 2 per cent			0
the minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £ 2.73 an hour , with all the new rates coming into force in october			0
the government said it had accepted recommendations from the @entity65 , including plans for bigger increases in future than in recent years			0
business secretary @entity69 said : ' the recommendations i have accepted today mean that low - paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since 2008			0
' this will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy			0
' with the @entity28 policy implemented in full , and another £ 500 rise in the income tax threshold to £ 10,500 expected in next week ’s @entity86 , @entity82 pressure has mounted for action to help middle earners			1
conservatives say the time has come for mr @entity5 to do something for the ‘ squeezed middle ’ earning between £ 40,000 and £ 60,000 @entity93 said : ‘ paying 40 pence to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £ 41,450 is at best demoralising			1
at worst , it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration			0
‘ the number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4 million this year to more than 6 million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation			1
’ @entity105 told @entity106 : ‘ it is affecting not just those at the threshold limit , who find that a payrise disappears , but people further down the income scale with aspirations			0
we need lower taxes across the board			0
’ however , the @entity17 insists that anyone earning less than £ 100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £ 10,000 , although basic rate payers have saved most – worth £ 700 - a - year			2
a spokesman said : ' the government believes the most effective way to support those on low and middle incomes , and to help them to be more financially secure , is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn			0
' that is why we have taken significant steps to increase the personal allowance – the amount an individual can earn before paying income tax			0
' although these increases have been targeted at low and middle income earners , higher rate taxpayers have also benefited			2
' as a result , a typical higher rate taxpayer will be around £ 56 better of this year than under inherited plans			0
' increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010 senior @entity82 say they have been told mr @entity5 will not act on the 40p rate because of the huge costs involved			1
meanwhile , mr @entity5 is facing calls to use any spare cash to offer a £ 5.4 billion national insurance break for businesses			1
right - leaning think - tank @entity154 argues the move would provide an incentive to boost jobs , pay and productivity and save firms £ 250 for each worker they employ			1
it urged the chancellor to focus on increasing the 2015/16 employer ni threshold to £ 192 per week , the equivalent of £ 10,000 per year , instead of changes to income tax .			2

chancellor faces calls from @entity82 *mps* to offer help for middle earners
by lowering 40p tax bracket to £ 41,450 the number caught is now 4.4million
think tank demands £ *5.4billion* in national insurance tax break for firms
