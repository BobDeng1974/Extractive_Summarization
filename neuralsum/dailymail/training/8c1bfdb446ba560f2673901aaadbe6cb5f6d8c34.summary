by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 4 september 2012 defeated : deputy prime minister @entity1 said he hoped plans for @entity4 reform would be revived in the next parliament @entity1 said today he hoped his plans to reform the @entity4 can be revived in the next parliament as he formally confirmed the proposals had been abandoned by the current government			1
the deputy prime minister has led calls for a mainly - elected second chamber , but was forced to concede defeat last month when faced with entrenched opposition from @entity14 mps and @entity16 's refusal to back a crucial timetable for the @entity18			1
as mps returned to @entity20 following the summer recess , mr @entity1 confirmed the @entity22 had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had ' inched us forward ' towards his goal of a reformed @entity4 - a flagship @entity27 policy			0
speaking in the @entity28 , he allowed himself a rueful smile as he told @entity13 : ' i would like to make a statement on @entity4 reform ... or what ’s left of it			1
' the formal announcement that the @entity22 had been killed off was greeted with cheers by @entity14 backbenchers sat behind the deputy prime minister			1
' i can confirm that the government has today withdrawn that @entity22 , about which i am not as happy as members behind me are , ' mr @entity1 said			2
he continued : ' regrettably the coalition will not be able to deliver @entity41 during this @entity42			0
' but mr @entity1 said that the ' hard work ' of mps and peers on the proposals had ' inched us forward '			2
the legislation was given a second reading by @entity13 earlier this year , as @entity16 backed the principle of the reforms			2
but the @entity22 's progress was halted as @entity16 sided with @entity14 rebels in refusing to back a timetable necessary to prevent it being talked out			0
scroll down to see @entity1 face the @entity55 little progress : mr @entity1 confirmed the @entity22 had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had ' inched us forward ' towards his goal of a reformed lords prime minister @entity61 failed to reach an agreement with his backbench rebels over the reforms and mr @entity1 was forced to concede defeat			1
mr @entity1 condemned @entity16 ’s actions , but told the @entity55 : ' my hope is that we will return to this in the next parliament , emboldened by the historic second reading vote			2
' for now , the immediate decision for the government is how we fill the gap in the legislative timetable and we will bring forward measures to promote growth			2
' deputy labour leader @entity79 said she shared mr @entity1 ’s ' disappointment at the lack of progress ' in reforming the upper chamber			1
status quo : legislation to reform the @entity4 received a second reading earlier this year , but mr @entity1 was forced to admit defeat for his proposals last month ' it ca n’t be right that in the 21st century we have an unelected chamber making decisions on the law of the land , ' she added			1
the fallout from mr @entity1 's humiliating defeat has widened cracks in the coalition government			0
when the deputy prime minister announced the end of the proposals last month , he claimed that the @entity103 had broken the coalition ' contract '			1
he revealed that , in retaliation , @entity27 @entity13 could no longer support changes to constituency boundaries for the 2015 general election			2
pressure point : @entity61 leaves 10 @entity111 today			0
cracks in his coalition government have widened after @entity14 rebels failed to support proposals for reform of the @entity4 @entity61 denied the contract had been broken , and said he intends to press ahead with the boundary changes , which would reduce the size of the @entity28 from 650 to 600 seats			1
it is thought the changes could deliver as many as 20 extra seats to the @entity103 , by equalising the size of constituencies across the @entity126			2
sympathy : deputy labour leader @entity79 said she shared mr @entity1 's ' disappointment at the lack of progress ' in reforming the upper chamber ms @entity79 asked mr @entity1 whether the process of boundary changes would now be stopped in its tracks as a result of @entity27 opposition			1
' is n’t it pointless and costly to allow the @entity137 to carry on with its work for a further 14 months ? ' she asked for an early opportunity for mps to vote on the issue , promising @entity16 support for mr @entity1			0
ms @entity79 asked : ' will you turn your words of august 6 into action ? the ball is in your court , will you assure the @entity18 that at least we have a deputy prime minister who is a man not a mouse			1
' but mr @entity1 attacked @entity16 , who he blamed for the @entity153 ’s failure , giving ms @entity79 ' 10 out of 10 for spectacular insincerity '			0
' the @entity16 used to campaign against privilege and patronage , ' he said			0
' the @entity16 used to say it was the party of the people			0
' the @entity16 used to believe that the second chamber should be abolished altogether			0
' and yet when push comes to shove what did they do ? ' the deputy prime minister continued : ' they voted for the idea of reform but not for the means to deliver it			1
' they delivered lofty speeches about the need to give the people a say about how to elect the legislators in the other place , but they would n’t even tell us how many days they wanted for the timetable motion to make that lofty rhetoric a reality			0
' i think the history books will judge the @entity16 very , very unkindly indeed			0
' mr @entity1 said that , faced with the opportunity to build on the work of former ministers @entity185 and @entity186 and be the ' friends of reform ' , @entity16 instead ' turned into miserable little party point - scoring politicians instead ' .			0
