the international break may represent a change of scenery for the players but for their managers it 's a time when nerves are frayed			1
they watch helplessly as their stars fly off to the four corners of the globe to represent their countries and can only pray they do n't return injured or fatigued			1
but tiredness seems inevitable when you take a look at the air miles some of the @entity16 players will be racking up over the next fortnight			2
@entity19 's @entity18 will fly over 14,600 miles to represent @entity20 in @entity21 friendlies with @entity22 and @entity23 @entity25 's @entity24 will also be part of the @entity20 squad making a long - haul trip to the @entity21			1
@entity29 , seen tackling him , is in the @entity31 squad also heading to @entity32 for friendlies @entity34 is just one of the @entity16 managers concerned their players will come back jet - lagged the @entity19 trio of @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity18 , as well as @entity25 's @entity24 , are named in the @entity20 squad for their friendlies against @entity22 in @entity41 and @entity23 in @entity42			1
they face a gruelling 14,600 - mile round trip to fulfil the money - spinning fixtures in the @entity21 , something that wo n't please @entity34 or @entity48 with important club games to come			1
@entity19 's @entity50 and @entity52 's @entity51 have already been withdrawn from @entity54 's squad for the friendlies , on saturday and tuesday , through injury			2
@entity58 manager @entity57 went public with his frustration at summer signings @entity61 and @entity62 having to fly 12,000 - plus miles to turn out for @entity22 in two friendlies			1
as their unconvincing 2 - 1 win over @entity67 on sunday proved , @entity64 needs time to work with his team ahead of a tough run of fixtures that includes @entity19 , @entity52 and @entity71 in the next six weeks			2
@entity61 is jetting off with @entity22 for matches against @entity20 in @entity41 and @entity73 @entity62 will also be part of the @entity76 party making the 12,276 - mile round trip to the @entity21 so he was understandably irritated that @entity61 and @entity62 are travelling so far to play in meaningless games			1
discussing @entity58 's poor second half performance against @entity67 , @entity64 said : ' that is why we have to train , but now all my players are gone			0
the rest are injured so we can not train			0
now i have to wait			0
' @entity61 and @entity62 are coming back from @entity73			2
they are playing two friendly games			0
they are coming back with jetlag so i can not train at once and then i have to wait			0
' then i have only two or three days before the game with @entity90			0
that is my problem i know and we live in this football world			0
' i was also a national coach [ with @entity95 ] but it is not so easy as everybody thinks			0
' @entity58 manager @entity57 expressed frustration that some players are going so far for friendlies @entity102 and @entity103 will play friendlies with @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity107 this week as mentioned earlier , @entity22 are in @entity41 to play @entity20 in the 2014 @entity108 , a fixture that can easily be taken and marketing around the globe , and then play @entity73 three days later			1
@entity64 can only count his blessings that @entity58 's match with @entity90 is n't until the monday night , giving him extra time to prepare			0
and he 'll take some consolation in the fact @entity102 , who opened his scoring account on sunday , is ' only ' going 6,900 miles over to @entity107 and back for friendlies with @entity105 and @entity106			2
others , like @entity71 boss @entity120 and @entity122 's @entity121 , have less time to get ready for the return of the league action			0
@entity126 ( right ) is heading off on a 14,577 - mile round trip back home to play two friendlies with @entity130 @entity120 can only wait and hope that all his players return from the international break without injury both will wave off the @entity136 members of their squad - @entity126 , @entity138 and @entity139 - on a 14,577 - mile round trip back home for friendlies against @entity143 on friday and @entity144 on tuesday			1
@entity71 play @entity145 at the @entity146 on saturday afternoon but with @entity126 unlikely to resume training until thursday at the earliest , he may feel a little sluggish come matchday			2
@entity150 , meanwhile , is one of five @entity16 and @entity152 players included in the @entity31 squad that will be making a 13,200 - mile whistlestop tour of @entity155 in @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity158 for two friendlies			1
he is joined by @entity29 of @entity90 , @entity159 of @entity67 , @entity160 of @entity161 and @entity162 of @entity163 for the long - haul trip			0
@entity67 's @entity159 has been called up to the @entity31 squad for matches with @entity156 and @entity158 @entity167 's @entity166 will feature for @entity158 in two home friendlies with @entity169 and @entity31 other players clocking up a five - figure mileage are the @entity173 duo of @entity166 of @entity167 and @entity174 of @entity175 , who will make the 11,119 - mile jaunt home and back for games with @entity169 on friday and @entity31 on tuesday			1
most players will be taking part in @entity152 qualifiers , meaning short - haul trips , but there is also competitive action taking place in @entity186			0
the qualifiers for the @entity188 next year have reached ther half - way point and all the leading nations are in action over the next few days			0
the @entity192 face a home and away double - header with @entity195 and @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 are all named in the squad for a round trip of over 8,000 miles			1
for the managers , it 's time to cross fingers they wo n't come back tired or , even worse , injured			0
@entity196 is in competitive action for the @entity192 as they take on @entity195 home and away @entity20 ( vs @entity22 in @entity41 on saturday and @entity23 in @entity42 on tuesday - 14,602 - miles all - round ) @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , @entity24 ( @entity25 ) @entity136 ( vs @entity143 in @entity208 on friday and @entity144 in @entity209 on tuesday - 14,577 miles ) @entity126 ( @entity71 ) , @entity138 , @entity139 ( @entity122 ) @entity31 ( vs @entity156 in @entity155 on friday and @entity158 in @entity157 on tuesday - 13,327 miles ) @entity29 ( @entity90 ) , @entity159 ( @entity67 ) , @entity160 ( @entity161 ) , @entity162 ( @entity163 ) , @entity150 ( @entity71 ) @entity22 ( vs @entity20 in @entity41 on saturday and @entity73 in @entity73 on tuesday - 12,276 miles ) @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 ( @entity52 ) , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity58 ) , @entity213 ( @entity214 ) , @entity215 ( @entity167 ) , @entity216 ( @entity217 ) @entity173 ( vs @entity169 in @entity218 on friday and @entity31 in @entity157 on tuesday - 11,119 miles ) @entity166 ( @entity167 ) , @entity174 ( @entity175 ) * distances calculated from @entity219			1
