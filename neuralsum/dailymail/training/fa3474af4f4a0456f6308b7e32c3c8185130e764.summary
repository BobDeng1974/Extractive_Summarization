sir @entity0 , the former head of @entity1 , praised the security services ' handing of threats from @entity6 terror cells , saying the law must keep ahead of the threat the former head of @entity1 today warns there are ‘ several thousand ’ individuals of concern in @entity6 as he demands tougher anti-terror powers to prevent a ‘ ghastly 7/7 - style attack ’			1
sir @entity0 also speaks out against the criticism of security services over their handling of @entity18 – unmasked as @entity19 – who is known to have been on their radar for at least six years			1
he will tell @entity22 ’s today : ‘ the threat that we face from terrorists here has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that			2
‘ what we do n’t want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7 - style terrorist attack here in the @entity6 before political opinion changes			2
‘ the whole point is to move incrementally to ensure that the powers and resources available to the security services , intelligence services , are ahead of that threat			2
’ sir @entity19 , who stepped down from @entity1 last november , added : ‘ i think in general when you look at the challenge that the security services are facing with the number of extremists here in the @entity6 , elsewhere in @entity43 , they do a really professional job and , of course , they know many of these individuals , most of them who end up taking part in terrorist organisations			1
‘ they ’d be more subject to criticism if someone came and committed an atrocity in this country or elsewhere who they had no knowledge of whatsoever			0
‘ they ’re doing their professional job by being aware of these people			0
but there are probably several thousand of these individuals of concern and the numbers are rising as more people go to @entity68 and @entity69 and are radicalised out there			0
‘ and no one is talking about rounding up all these people or keeping 100 per cent coverage , there ’s just not the resources to do that and it would be contrary to our principles of human rights to do that … so you do have to find a balance in there			1
’ sir @entity19 also dismissed claims the treatment of @entity85 by @entity86 that may have helped radicalise him as ‘ very specious arguments ’			1
however , the counter-terrorism laws watchdog @entity89 said the intelligence agencies may have made a ‘ slip - up ’ in failing to impose tighter controls on @entity85 due to the sheer number of suspects they have to cope with			2
mr @entity95 said he was not surprised that @entity18 was not subject to measures such as house arrest , despite being on @entity86 ’s radar , because the @entity6 ’s spies and counter-terrorism police were very busy			0
his warning came as @entity102 attacked ministers yesterday for scrapping control orders on terror suspects that could have prevented the murderer from slipping out of @entity6 to join @entity108			1
butchers : heavily armed is fanatics in @entity69			0
security services fear their followers could use the same sort of weapons on @entity6 ’s streets in what was seen as stinging criticism of home secretary @entity121 ’s decision to replace the orders – under which suspects are tagged and confined to specific areas – with less restrictive measures , the @entity117 mayor said : ‘ what this shows is we need to keep a very , very close eye on these people			1
‘ the decision to modify the control orders , to water them down , i think looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able , when you are controlling these people , to be able to relocate them , to take them away from their support networks and … to monitor them			1
’ mr @entity102 spoke out after it was revealed that @entity18 , 26 , had been on the radar of the security services for six years as part of a support network for @entity117 - based terror suspects and extremists , some on control orders			1
but these were replaced in 2011 by the @entity148 – under intense pressure from the @entity150 – with less restrictive @entity151 and @entity152 ( @entity153 ) making it harder to monitor movements of terror suspects			1
‘ the balance , the benefit of the doubt was , i am afraid , given too much to those who wish us serious harm , ’ mr @entity102 said			1
@entity163 , the government ’s former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , said @entity18 would have been placed under a control order			2
shadow home secretary @entity167 said : ‘ we warned the government not to abolish control orders			1
’ @entity171 said he is ' worried ' about the spread of @entity173 , and the threat pop - up cells pose to the @entity6 police forces may have to work more closely with the @entity177 under plans to thwart ‘ pop - up ’ terror cells			2
defence chiefs are investigating how troops could give back - up to armed officers and how military helicopters could be used to move police around the country in the event of a @entity190 - style atrocity			0
special forces are already being prepared for urgent intervention against @entity108 fanatics , the @entity191 said yesterday			0
@entity171 added : ‘ we are facing @entity108 in @entity68 and it is on the borders of @entity43			0
it is becoming a very direct threat to @entity43			0
' we need to do something about it			0
i ’m worried about the fight against @entity203 , i ’m worried about this spread of @entity203 , this kind of pop - up is , which can link up very easily			0
‘ the home secretary has been looking at how you can deploy sufficient numbers of armed officers in areas outside @entity117			0
‘ and if they had an incident or two incidents or people fleeing from @entity216 or @entity117 out to the countryside , do they really have enough armed officers to deal with that ? ’ he said that it was in those circumstances that the @entity177 could be drafted in for large - scale operations , such as searching a forest or cordoning off a railway station .			0

sir @entity19 says @entity1 needs to strike balance in policing terror suspects
said thousands are known to agents , but can not be *constantly* monitored
warning comes as @entity102 attacked scrapping of control orders
