the @entity0 are one of the most iconic images ever to be captured by the @entity3			2
now , astronomers have produced the first complete three - dimensional view of these beautiful columns of interstellar gas and dust			2
the image , together with data collected by @entity11 , suggests these structures only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms			1
the original @entity3 image of the famous @entity0 was taken two decades ago and immediately became one of its most famous and evocative pictures			2
the jutting structures , along with the nearby star cluster , @entity26 , are parts of a star formation region called the @entity26 , also known as @entity26 or @entity26			0
the nebula and its associated objects are located about 7000 light - years away in the constellation of @entity32 ( @entity33 )			1
located in the @entity26 , @entity35 16 , researchers used the @entity37 instrument on @entity39 's @entity38 ( @entity38 ) create the @entity41 view			1
the new study reports fresh evidence for two gestating stars in the left and middle pillars as well as a jet from a young star that had escaped attention up to now			2
for more stars to form in environments like the @entity0 , it is a race against time as intense radiation from the powerful stars that are already shining continues to grind away at the pillars			2
by measuring the @entity0 's rate of evaporation , @entity37 has given astronomers a time frame for when the pillars will be no more			1
they shed about 70 times the mass of the sun every million years or so			1
based on the their present mass of about 200 times that of the sun , the @entity0 have an expected lifetime of perhaps three million more years			1
some scientists have put forward the theory that the @entity0 were already killed by a neighboring supernova some 6,000 years ago			2
if this is the case , astronomers on @entity72 wo n’t know for another 1,000 years , when the light from the descruction reaches our planet			2

' this view shows how the @entity37 instrument on @entity39 's @entity38 has created a three - dimensional view of the iconic @entity0 in the star - forming region @entity26			1
each pixel in the data corresponds to a spectrum			0
the ' slices ' of data correspond to some of the different chemical elements present			0
' since then , these billowing clouds , which extend over a few light - years , have awed scientists and the public alike			1

the @entity0 are a classic example of the column - like shapes that develop in the giant clouds of gas and dust that are the birthplaces of new stars			0
the columns arise when immense , freshly formed blue – white o and b stars give off intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds that blow away less dense materials from their vicinity			0
denser pockets of gas and dust , however , can resist this erosion for longer			0
behind such thicker dust pockets , material is shielded from the harsh , withering glare of o and b stars			0
the original @entity11 / @entity16 @entity3 image of the famous @entity0 was taken two decades ago this shielding creates dark ' tails ' or ' elephant trunks ' , which we see as the dusky body of a pillar , that point away from the brilliant stars			0
@entity39 's @entity37 instrument on the @entity38 has now helped illustrate the ongoing evaporation of the @entity0 in unprecedented detail , revealing their orientation			1
@entity37 has shown that the tip of the left pillar is facing us , atop a pillar that is is actually situated behind @entity26 , unlike the other pillars			0
this tip is bearing the brunt of the radiation from @entity26 's stars , and as a result looks brighter to our eyes than the bottom left , middle and right pillars , whose tips are all pointed away from our view			1
astronomers hope to better understand how young o and b stars like those in @entity26 influence the formation of subsequent stars			0

instrument on @entity39 's @entity38 ( @entity38 ) captured image
shows exactly how the different dusty pillars are *distributed* in space
the pillars shed about 70 times the mass of the sun every million years
they are expected to have a lifetime of perhaps three million more years - which is relatively short in cosmic terms
