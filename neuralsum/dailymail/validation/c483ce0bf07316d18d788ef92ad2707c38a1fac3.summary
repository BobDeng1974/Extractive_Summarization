the @entity0 , @entity2 federal judge who blocked president @entity5 's executive action on immigration has ordered the @entity7 to answer allegations that the government misled him about part of the plan			1
@entity14 district judge @entity13 on monday denied the @entity5 administration 's request to lift a time - out he enforced on feb. 16 , when he ruled that a lawsuit filed by 26 states might succeed			1
his order was designed , he said , to prevent a situation that could n't be undone if it were declared unconstitutional			0
it also seemed to fire a shot across the @entity25 's bow , blaming the administration for failing to keep illegal immigrants out of the country			2
hot seat : president @entity5 , seen tuesday signing the ' student aid @entity32 ' law in the @entity33 , faces the possibility that his immigration plans will die in federal court here comes the judge : federal jurist @entity13 is calling the @entity5 administration on the carpet about the president 's immigration plan ' the court finds that the government 's failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country , ' @entity13 ruled in february , saying that states were being financially ' drained by the constant influx of illegal immigrants			1
' his stay will remain in place for at least another 10 days , pending a march 19 hearing where the @entity7 will have tough questions to answer			2
last week the government 's lawyers admitted in a paper filing that the @entity5 administration had already granted three - year deportation reprieves to 100,000 people , and granted them work permits , as part of the 2012 @entity62 ( @entity62 ) program			1
that program 's guidelines provided only for two - year reprieves , unlike @entity5 's latest executive actions			1
plaintiff : @entity2 gov. @entity69 is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors @entity7 attorneys had previously told @entity13 that the federal government would n't accept @entity62 requests with longer timeframes until feb. 18			2
the judge 's order came on the 16th , legally prohibiting them from issuing any three - year permits			2
the president 's more recent attempt to mainstream illegal immigrants , announced in november , will cover 5 million or more people and will ultimately go into force unless the judiciary blocks it			1
the group of 26 states suing to stop @entity5 's immigration plan argue in their legal complaint that the government falsely claimed it had n't implemented any part of the november plan before @entity13 blocked it			1
@entity13 's injunction had no effect on the @entity62 program , but his demand for a new hearing suggest he 's looking at that program in addition to @entity5 's more recent executive actions , which concern illegal immigrant parents of @entity14 citizens born in the @entity14 , and other permanent residents who have been in the country for years			1
the government has asked him to lift the stay completely while they appeal it to the 5th @entity108 in @entity109 , or at least to limit the impact of his decisions to @entity2			0
with monday 's ruling , that wo n't happen until at least march 19			0
@entity114 : conservatives have bristled at the idea of the @entity25 tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay @entity120 : more than 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the @entity14 , including millions who were brought to @entity14 as children and many born here to illegal immigrant mothers advocates on both sides of the immigration fight told the @entity129 on tuesday that @entity13 is seen as a fairminded jurist			2
' that gentleman is constantly hearing the prosecution of drug cartel violence in his courtroom , ' @entity132 state rep. @entity131 told the @entity129			0
' when he says we need to have proper border enforcement , it â€™s because he sees the worst of it			0
' and a @entity143 trial lawyer who was among @entity13 's law school classmates said that he supports the @entity25 's position ' 100 percent			0
' but still , he said , ' i would disagree with anyone who would say @entity148 has any prejudice			0
his decisions will always be based on sound legal grounds			0
' another classmate , @entity108 judge @entity152 , sits on the 5th circuit panel that will likely hear the case next .			0

@entity5 administration told judge @entity13 that it had n't moved past implementing @entity5 's 2012 ' @entity62 ' immigration plan
but now the government admits it began implementing @entity5 's newest executive actions , giving illegal immigrants 3 - year deportation reprieves
march 19 hearing will sort it out , but the president 's november 2014 plan remains on hold
@entity13 ordered a *standstill* on feb. 18 in a case where 26 states sued to block 5 million people in the @entity14 illegally from getting @entity176 *nymbers* , work permits and green cards
