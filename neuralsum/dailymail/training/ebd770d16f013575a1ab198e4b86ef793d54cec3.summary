by @entity0 if you ’re baring your legs this summer , spare a thought for bin men who have been banned from wearing shorts			2
despite temperatures reaching @entity8 , @entity9 council chiefs say staff ca n’t wear the shorts which were issued last year			1
they claim ditching trousers would create a health and safety risk and say the @entity13 would need to declare a health warning - with temperatures averaging @entity16 - for shorts to be worn			1
hot : bin men have been banned from wearing shorts by @entity19 , despite the mercury hitting @entity21 @entity24 staff and union representatives dismissed the ruling as ‘ ridiculous ’			1
one council worker said : ‘ last year we were given the option of having one pair of shorts as part of our uniform			2
‘ a lot of people took this up but now we have been refused permission to wear shorts because it 's not hot enough			2
former bin man and @entity37 union rep @entity35 said : ‘ it is ridiculous , i have never heard anything like it			0
when it is warm , as long as they are wearing the right foot - ware in case they drop bins , i do n't see a problem			0
’ a letter was sent by the council stating that staff , which include bin men , gardeners and street cleaners , can only wear shorts if they have authorisation and the weather is ‘ extreme			1
’ risk : council gardeners have also been stopped from baring their legs because council chiefs reckon they present a health and safety threat councillor @entity61 , who is a member of the @entity37 union , said : ‘ i do n't have any problem with them wearing shorts ; they are out in all weathers and they need to be comfortable			1
’ but his fellow councillor @entity69 said it was up to council bosses to decided when staff can wear shorts			1
he said : ‘ the shorts are only worn during spells of extremely hot weather and our managers will decide when it is appropriate to wear them			2
’ protection : the council said workers had to cover up to protect themselves from injury ‘ our staff turn out in all kinds of weather to carry out hard physical work around the city			0
making sure they feel comfortable and valued at work is good for the council and good for the city too			0
’ a council spokesperson said workers ’ legs needed to be covered up to protect them			0
‘ the trousers are designed to protect them from sharp objects , flying glass , thorns and other hazards they may encounter during their day - to - day work , such as discarded needles			0
‘ our main priority is protecting our workers from harm , because it would be unforgiveable if we put them in danger , but unfortunately the shorts offer little protection against injury			0
‘ the only reason we would let staff wear shorts is if we received warnings from other agencies , such as the @entity116 or the @entity13 , that the weather was hot enough to pose a health risk			1
there is no trigger temperature involved - we just use common sense and listen to expert advice			0
‘ we have to weigh up the risks and decide whether the heatwave danger outweighs the need for workers to protect their lower legs from injury			0
‘ we 're one of the few councils that allow staff to wear shorts at work , and it was very popular with the staff when we tried it out during last summer 's spell of extreme hot weather			1
