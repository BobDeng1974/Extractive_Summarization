argan oil is something of an all - round beauty superhero : the skin , hair and nail saviour is beloved by stars @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 for its rich , moisturising properties			1
and the oil , often dubbed ' liquid gold ' due to its rarity and expense , is also providing a lifeline for @entity18 women and their families in the semi-desert @entity21 valley of south western @entity22 , one of the only regions in the world where the argan tree grows			1
long used as a traditional remedy by @entity18 women to treat wrinkles , scars , and acne , argan oil is renowned for being incredibly moisturising , highly anti-inflammatory and easily absorbed			1
it 's recently become one of the beauty world 's biggest new breakthroughs , despite being known to @entity22 since the thirteenth century			2
beauty secret : @entity39 beauties @entity7 , left , and @entity40 , right , swear by the power of argan oil - and the production of it in @entity22 is helping women earn a living in a remote desert where work is hard to find a relatively small geographical area - 9,900 square miles in southwestern @entity22 - produces nearly all of the world ’s argan oil			1
because the trees are under threat , @entity53 ( @entity53 ) has declared the region a biosphere ( an artificial structure enclosing a self - contained ecosystem ) reserve in 1998			2
one large @entity62 company makes just over half of the argan oil , and then there are lots of smaller cooperatives			2
one of the biggest companies to reap the oil is @entity70 , who support the @entity72 , the world ’s first @entity75 certified women ’s @entity73 cooperative			1
they the first women ’s only argan cooperative and the first @entity75 argan cooperative			0
nyr as a company were awarded 100 per cent for it ’s ethical standards			0
established in 2007 by women who met at a literacy class , it has now become a hugely successful cooperative providing women in the region with work to support their families			2
today , the 60 members of the cooperative work in every area of the business , from collecting , transporting ( by donkey ) , hand - cracking and pressing the nuts , and all have access to top administrative positions			1
@entity99 say is an incredible achievement anywhere , but particularly in the traditionally male - orientated @entity18 community			0
hard at work : one of the biggest companies to reap the oil is @entity70 , who set up the @entity72 - a team of 60 @entity18 women who collect and harvest the nuts - all whilst clapping and singing where it all begins : @entity110 and her team produce 1,000 litres of oil every month by hand cracking each and every nut to produce thousands of litres of argan oil the income is helping to change not only the women ’s lives , but also their family ’s too			1
once completely financially dependent on their husbands , the women can now contribute to the household income ; many providing the family 's only regular salary			0
they have money to send their children to school beyond primary school , giving them to opportunity to progress to high school and even university ; and the women have access to literacy and health care training			0
not surprisingly , the women ’s self - esteem has had a massive boost			0
according to a spokeswoman at the cooperative , women now have more confidence in themselves because they feel important in their home			0
making a living : a relatively small geographical area - 9,900 square miles in southwestern @entity22 - produces nearly all of the world 's argan oil lifeline : @entity151 , natural health director at @entity70 with @entity153 , president of the @entity72 @entity110 , 37 , is married with four boys under 13 and was one of the original cooperative workers when she joined seven years ago			1
@entity110 , who is the main breadwinner in her family , said : ' we speak together , dance together , work , joke and enjoy life together			0
' here in the countryside there would be no other work without argan			0
in the city you can do cleaning , but nothing else here			0
' @entity110 and her team produce 1,000 litres of oil every month			0
a spokesperson for @entity70 said : ' in 2012 we were ordering one kilo of argan oil , since its popularity has grown so rapidly in last couple of years , we are now ordering 900 kilos			1
finished product : the women collect , hand - crack and press the nuts to create this £ 17.50 @entity185 's @entity184 argan oil ' at @entity70 we sell the oil on its own as part of our base oil collection , as well as including it in other products , such as our organic lipsticks , mascara and body care products for its nourishing properties			1
' we have always strived to go above and beyond to be as ethical as possible , and recently we were awarded the first @entity197 company to achieve 100 % under the @entity200 's ' @entity199 ' scheme			0
' and it seems the a-listers ca n't get enough of the beauty weapon			0
supermodel @entity204 has long said that argan oil is an essential part of her beauty routine , while @entity40 said that the oil is her ' total skin secret ' and described it as ' spectacular '			1
@entity210 counts it as a huge part of prepping for a photo shoot and celebrities stylists say that when @entity216 and @entity217 prepare themselves for photoshoots , they douse a few drops of argan oil into their skin and hair			1
other fans include @entity224 , @entity8 , @entity7 , @entity225 and @entity62 beauty @entity226			2
