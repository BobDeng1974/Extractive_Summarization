they are the feminists famous for staging topless protests , with @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity5 's @entity4 among those treated to a bare - breasted display			1
now founder member and leader of @entity10 , @entity11 , 23 , has thrown open the doors of the organisation 's @entity13 to a @entity16 film crew			1
@entity11 , who was given political asylum in @entity10 last year , has masterminded the expansion of the feminist organisation , adding branches in @entity21 , @entity5 and @entity22 to the original @entity24 movement			1
' when they ask me how [ @entity27 ] started , i say i have a big reason because i was born as a woman in this time and in this society , ' she elaborates			2
' and at some point , you look around and you understand that you do n't want to live like your mother , you do n't want to live like your aunt , you do n't want to live like your neighbours			0
' you want something different but you do n't know what because no one told you that there was something different			0
' at the beginning it was just anger inside and we still keep it inside and it 's growing with every new action - it 's growing			2
' militant : @entity11 at @entity27 's @entity13 and right , taking a chainsaw to a wooden cross in central @entity55 leaders : @entity57 ( centre ) with fellow @entity27 leaders , @entity60 ( left ) and @entity61 ( right ) ' actions ' over the last year have included an angry protest against violence during a @entity66 rally in the @entity68 city of @entity69 , mobbing @entity71 prime minister @entity70 during a visit to a polling station and interrupting anti-abortion rallies in @entity21 and @entity75			1
other targets have included @entity77 's president @entity2 ( still a favourite ) , religious groups of all denominations and prostitution			1
@entity11 herself is no stranger to any of them , and is regularly to be found in the thick of the action , topless and daubed with painted slogans			1
' we 're using topless style of protest to show that women are protesting , ' she explains of the group 's famous bare - breasted protests			2
the method even extends to the internet with @entity2 ( yes , him again ) becoming the target of a slew of topless photos , each featuring the legend : ' @entity99 ! ' it 's an approach that can sometimes prove controversial , as @entity11 herself knows only too well after being forced to flee @entity24 following a stunt that provoked the ire of authorities and church groups alike			1
angry : @entity11 , pictured right , says she and activists from @entity27 will continue for as long as they 're angry fighting back : @entity110 police drag a @entity27 activist protesting about @entity113 's behaviour away no to fashion : a pair of @entity27 activists stormed the @entity117 catwalk during @entity3 last autumn ' one year ago i chainsawed through an eight - metre wooden cross in the middle of main square in @entity55 , ' she remembers fondly			1
' we were protesting about the connection between the garments of church and the influence of religion on society			0
' but her protest , which made headlines around the world , would have serious consequences for the then fledgling campaigner			0
' one morning i woke up because i heard the secret service knocking on the door , ' she reveals			0
' i was kind of ready for that situation and i left the country through the window , through the balcony of my apartment			0
thrown out : a pair of @entity27 activists are manhandled by guards after storming @entity5 's @entity4 plastic : an activist bearing the slogan , ' life in @entity144 is not fantastic ' , outside the @entity148 in @entity5 protest : a @entity27 activist is dragged away after a protest during a @entity152 rally in @entity69 in @entity68 ' it was on the first floor and i had my passport and mobile telephone and since that day i did n't come back to @entity24			1
' her flight left her cut off from friends and family in @entity24 , although the bullish @entity11 says being part of @entity27 makes up for the separation			2
' it 's not my job , what i do , ' she explains			0
' it 's not my job , it 's my life			0
i 'm activist more than daughter of someone and i 'm activist more than , i do n't know , friend of someone and i 'm activist more than girlfriend of someone			0
' it 's not my job , it 's my life			0
how many times do i have to repeat it ? ' @entity11 appears on @entity181 with @entity182 , friday at 10pm on @entity183 .			2
