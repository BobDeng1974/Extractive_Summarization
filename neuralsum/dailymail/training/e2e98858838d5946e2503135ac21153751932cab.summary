by @entity0 sex offender : @entity2 served 13 months in prison in 2007 for relations with teen girls victims of billionaire sex offender @entity2 have won the right to see the negotiations that led to an apparently lenient plea deal that saw him avoid federal prosecution			1
an appeals court ruled that the two victims , known only as @entity14 1 and 2 , can soon view the documents - as their attorneys ask whether @entity2 's wealth and connections affected his sentence			1
@entity2 , 61 , had counted numerous celebrities , politicians and socialites as friends , including @entity25 , prince @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
the financier was first arrested in 2005 , after the stepmother of a 14 - year - old girl told @entity33 police that he 'd paid the girl $ 200 for an ' erotic massage '			2
an @entity38 investigation led to @entity2 being accused of keeping a harem of women - many of them teenagers - at his luxury homes in @entity44 and @entity45 , and on a private @entity47 island			1
by 2008 , the @entity38 believed it had identified at least 20 victims who might level sexual allegations against the financier in court			0
but @entity2 struck a plea deal with prosecutors , which saw him plead guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution			1
the rest of the case was dropped			0
he received an 18 - month jail sentence , of which 13 were spent behind bars , and was put on floridaâ € ™ s sex offenders register			0
he escaped prosecution on more serious pedophilia charges , which might have seen him jailed for life			0
scene : he allegedly paid underage girls for ' erotic massages ' at his private @entity47 island , @entity73 but it also also resulted in civil suits being filed against @entity2 , who reportedly settled claims from about two dozen young women , some as young as 14 , who he allegedly paid for massages			1
the latest ruling in the case was issued on friday and orders federal authorities to disclose the correspondence that took place between @entity2 's attorneys and federal prosecutors when they were negotiating the 2007 agreement , the @entity80 reported			2
' we 're trying to figure out if @entity2 used his political connections and great wealth to secure this kind of arrangement , that was unheard of , frankly , if you look at these charges , ' said attorney @entity98			0
court filings say that when federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with @entity2 in september 2007 , the victims were n't told			2
' not only did the @entity106 neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with @entity2 , it also failed to notify them of its existence for at least nine months , ' circuit judge @entity103 wrote in the decision			2
friends : among his good friends were @entity25 ( pictured ) , his wife @entity116 , @entity27 and @entity28 now the two victims are hoping that the documents will shed light on the deal , and their attorney hopes that the deal will be invalidated and that @entity2 will face a new prosecution			1
they have yet to see the documents , however			0
the attorneys were initially told they would receive them on monday , but they were not yet ready to be viewed			0
one of @entity2 's attorney 's , @entity127 , insisted that the plea agreement was ' reached in good faith ' and that there was nothing improper about the dealings			1
he said he will ask the appeal court to review their decision .			0
