' deeply offensive ' : @entity1 , who incredibly claimed being in the @entity2 is ' unaffordable ' to normal people because peers only get £ 300 a day serving in the @entity2 is ‘ unaffordable ’ for normal people because peers only get a tax - free allowance of £ 300 a day , a senior @entity5 said last night			1
@entity1 , deputy chairman of @entity10 ’s @entity9 team , said the lavish expenses paid to peers were too low to allow people to give up their jobs			1
critics last night said her comments would be ‘ deeply offensive ’ to millions of people earning far less			1
but @entity19 , who was handed a peerage by mr @entity10 last year , complained that the irregular nature of payments from the @entity2 meant it was difficult to even get a mortgage			1
asked about the composition of the @entity2 , she told @entity25 : ‘ what you do n’t get is a hairdresser , what you do n’t get is a bus driver			2
and why do n’t you get those people ? because it ’s unaffordable for most people to do this kind of thing unless you are relying on a partner			0
‘ a salary in the @entity2 alone , a bank wo n’t accept it as payment for a mortgage			1
it varies dramatically because you clock on when you sit - because it ’s an allowance , rather than a salary			0
’ @entity45 are eligible for a tax - free allowance of £ 300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in			2
they are not required to speak in debates or vote , and do not have to stay all day			0
peers can claim a lower rate of £ 150 even if they are doing other paid work outside the @entity2 on the same day			1
official figures show that @entity54 , a former pr executive and media pundit , attended the @entity2 on 81 days in her first six months and claimed £ 20,850 in attendance allowances in that time			1
the allowances are equal to a pre-tax annual salary of just under £ 60,000 a year – more than two - and - a - half times the average annual salary for a full - time job in the @entity61			0
by comparison , the @entity62 ’ 2012 salary survey found that the average hairdresser earns just over £ 10,000 a year , while the average bus driver earns less than £ 23,000			0
@entity68 mp @entity67 said @entity54 ’s comments showed she was ‘ completely out of touch ’			1
mr @entity67 , mp for @entity72 , in @entity73 , said : ‘ she is talking total , absolute nonsense			0
i could find plenty of hairdressers round here who would happily turn up to the @entity2 for £ 300 a day – they would be queuing up to do it			1
‘ it just shows she is part of an out - of - touch @entity83 elite – many people will find her comments deeply offensive			1
’ nice little earner : @entity45 are eligible for a tax - free allowance of £ 300 a day simply by turning up and clocking in			0
they are not required to speak in debates or vote , and do not have to stay all day @entity90 , campaign manager for the @entity91 ’ @entity89 , said : ‘ a hairdresser or a bus driver would be delighted by a tax - free cheque of £ 300 a day			0
' @entity2 does n't sit full - time and there are plenty of peers who do additional jobs to top up their income			2
' it 's comments like these that only serve to widen the perceived divide between @entity83 and ordinary taxpayers			1
’ the expenses system in the @entity2 has been mired in controversy			2
earlier this year the former @entity108 peer @entity109 was suspended from the @entity2 after he was caught on camera ‘ clocking in ’ for his £ 300 allowance and then leaving immediately for his home in @entity113			1
dangerous place : @entity54 also revealed she has been the victim of sexual harassment at @entity83 meanwhile , @entity54 also became the latest @entity5 woman to reveal she has been the victim of sexual harassment at @entity83			2
asked if she had suffered unwanted sexual advances , she said : ‘ yes , from an mp , who ’s now dead			0
when i first started working in @entity120 in my early 20s , i would say that i had no idea i could complain that i was being sexually harassed by somebody who was a member of parliament			0
it just did n’t even occur to me			0
and i ’m really pleased it now occurs to people			0
’ @entity54 said the scandal caused by allegations of sexual harassment against former @entity5 chief executive @entity129 had cast a ‘ dark cloud ’ over the party			2
she added : ‘ i think it ’s been damaging and divisive in the party , but i think we are where we are and we all need to just move on			0

critics last night called *baroness* @entity1 's comments ' deeply offensive '
