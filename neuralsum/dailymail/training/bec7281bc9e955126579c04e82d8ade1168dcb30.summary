@entity0 will be sitting pretty this @entity0 after swapping his tired wooden sledge for this high - tech ' super sleigh '			1
the £ 200,000 ( $ 313,000 ) carriage comes complete with built - in gps navigation , parking sensors and a chimney camera			1
it also features a bulletproof @entity10 polycarbonate front window , a convertible roof and a built - in nose wiper for @entity14 's magical reindeer			1
pimp my sleigh : the £ 200,000 ( $ 313,000 ) carriage comes complete with built - in gps navigation , parking sensors and a chimney camera and more presents could get delivered this year as @entity22 and his friends will have access to hybrid - powered rocket boosters when they are running low on energy			1
other features include an e-reader mount for easy access to the naughty - and - nice list , a mistletoe air freshener and a cup warmer with hot chocolate			1
the concept @entity36 900 ( @entity37 - 900 ) has been designed by @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 in time for @entity41			1
' we just felt like @entity14 deserved a bit of an upgrade , ' said customer service operative , @entity46 said : ' his old wooden sleigh is a little bit dated and we wanted to bring him into the 21st century			2
' move over @entity49 : the sleigh also features a bulletproof @entity10 polycarbonate front window , a convertible roof and a built - in nose wiper crackers : more presents could get delivered this year as @entity22 and his friends will have access to hybrid - powered rocket boosters supersonic : the concept @entity36 900 ( @entity37 - 900 ) has been designed by @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 in time for @entity41 ' the rocket boosters can give the reindeer a hand too if they get tired			1
' the sleigh is streamlined , for maximum efficiency and , for the first time ever , @entity14 can now listen to festive tunes on his travels , with the integrated sound system			1
according to science , the speed at which the reindeers fly will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight he 's making a list , and checking it twice , to find out who has been naughty and nice			1
but @entity14 might also want to jot down a few equations and sums , as he 'll need to grapple with the laws of physics come @entity41			1
of course , it 's unlikely @entity14 has to deal with the rules of science in quite the same way as regular people , but he might want to take a glance or two at the task awaiting him on his trip this year			0
for starters , assuming that @entity14 does n't handle certain faiths , he 'll have about 378 million children to deliver to in a fairly short time frame , according to one scientist			2
that means he has 822.6 visits per second to cope with , requiring a stay of about one thousandth of a second to deliver presents to each home			0
all in all , @entity14 's sleigh will need to move about 650 miles ( 1,050km ) per second , which is 3,000 times the speed of sound or 0.35 per cent the speed of light			2
if each child were to receive a present no more than 2lbs ( 0.9kg ) in weight , the sleigh would still weigh more than 320,000 tons - just shy of the weight of the @entity108 , 370,000 tons			1
an average reindeer on @entity110 can pull only 300 pounds ( 135kg ) , so in this scenario 214,200 reindeer would be needed			0
but with the weight and speed of the sleigh , it appears that the front two @entity118 and @entity119 , until @entity22 's inclusion - will be subjected to 13.4 quintillion joules of energy per second			1
this will cause them to burst into flames almost immediately after taking flight			0
the entire reindeer team , assuming only eight are used , would be vapourised in 4.26 thousandths of a second			0
if anyone but @entity14 wants to fly through the sky , they 'll need to stump up a hefty of £ 200,000 ( $ 313,000 )			0
mr @entity46 said : ' we 've had a lot of interest but no - one has actually ordered one yet			2
if anyone does order one , we will build one complete with all the features			2
' the @entity140 's product page comes with fake reviews from @entity142 , mrs @entity143 and an elf			0
' i love the sleigh			0
it makes my job easier and the nose - wiper is perfect			0
i 've noticed my nose shining brighter than ever , ' wrote @entity142			0
mrs @entity143 said : ' the @entity151 is far better than the wooden sleigh and also much safer			0
he 'll get back from his trip much earlier this year which is great as i always give him a little treat on his return			0
' early designs : the sleigh is streamlined @entity14 can now also listen to festive tunes on his travels , with the integrated sound system elf and safety : ' the sleigh makes my job easier and the nose - wiper is perfect			2
