long - standing issues throughout the @entity2 game have led to disappointment in their home @entity5 , according to @entity6			1
the 2002 @entity5 winner believes the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) needs to work closer with the government , club sides and ex-professionals to improve football at every level in the country			1
having won the right to host the 2014 tournament - despite their bid leading to mass protests due to the amount of money required to stage the @entity5 - @entity22 could not deliver the trophy and were humiliated in the semi-finals as they crashed out following a 7 - 1 thrashing at the hands of @entity27			1
better times : @entity6 ( right ) was part of the 2002 @entity5 winning squad in @entity31 and @entity32 nightmare : injured @entity34 could n't bear to watch as @entity22 went down to @entity35 @entity35 then inflicted more pain as they beat the hosts to win the third - place play - off 3 - 0 and @entity6 reckons the problems are much deeper than the current crop of internationals simply not measuring up to their predecessors			1
' it is hard to say where things went wrong , ' he told @entity48 's @entity47			0
' it is not all about the national team - it is about what is happening in @entity2 football			2
' they way people administrate football and run football in this country , they must work better on coaching schools and academies			2
' there is something also with the country 's problems - at some point that is nothing to do with football but at times they come together			1
' everyone expected us to win as a solution for the problems in our country but i hope people pay attention and try to work better to find a solution , that is what i want			0
' devastation : a tearful @entity77 is comforted by @entity78 after the @entity27 result that shook @entity22 deep - rooted : @entity22 's media blamed @entity82 's team but @entity6 thinks the problems are bigger tackling the problem : @entity6 blamed footballing administrators and says he predicted the failure months ago the former @entity88 midfielder revealed he had teamed up with a number of former internationals to raise concerns about the running of the @entity2 game 12 months ago - but their approach fell on deaf ears			1
' there are group of players who have good sense , i 'm involved with them and we are trying for better solutions on the football side and i hope from now on that people pay attention to what we are asking for , ' he said			0
' a group of players , we have good sense , we asked for months - we spoke to @entity8 and the government to speak about the situation and the football			0
dream start : @entity115 scores from the spot against @entity2 goalkeeper @entity117 in the third minute down and out : @entity118 scored the 10th goal against @entity22 in two games - a new low ' now people are starting to pay attention about what we asked , sometimes they do n't pay wages for the players and are not very good at administration there are a lot of problems and they cant solve that			2
' at some point the crack comes and today is n't the factor for what has happened now in the @entity5 it has come from the last 10 years			0
' year by year there is something wrong and at some point you feel the pain - slowly and slowly it has come to this point			0
