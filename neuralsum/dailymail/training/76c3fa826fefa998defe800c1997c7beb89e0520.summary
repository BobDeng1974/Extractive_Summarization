' the reason we expect fewer @entity11 minis compared to the 3rd gen is because of the lack of the wireless option and newness of the smaller form factor for consumers , ' @entity187 said in a note to clients			2
' we believe that over time that will change			0
' reviewers have applauded @entity5 for squeezing most of the @entity11 's features into a smaller package that can be comfortably manipulated with one hand			1

the image is really good and it 's got the fast @entity228 chip too , ' @entity206 said			0
the @entity11 was launched in 2010 by late @entity5 boss @entity229 and since then it has taken a big chunk out of pc sales , upending the industry and reinventing mobile computing with its apps - based ecosystem			1
