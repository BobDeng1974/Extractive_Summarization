by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 17 october 2012 @entity1 and @entity2 insist they enjoy a more cordial alliance than some previous occupants of @entity6			0
but their pets are not afraid to get their claws out over who would make a better pm – that is , @entity13			2
just before dawn yesterday , @entity14 , the chancellor ’s cat , took on @entity18 , the prime minister ’s pet , in a very public catfight			1
the pm 's cat @entity18 takes a claw to the neck in the scrap with @entity2 's pet @entity14 outside @entity27 this morning @entity14 ( right ) nudges into @entity18 in the early morning scrap the two cats circled each other before @entity14 went in with a claw to @entity18 's neck after circling her opponent with what onlookers described as a ‘ deathly stare ’ , the street ’s feisty newcomer attacked			1
@entity18 attempted to put up a fight , but after @entity14 landed a paw on his neck he was forced to flee back to @entity27			1
witnesses said that relations between the two cats have been strained since @entity14 usurped @entity18 from his role of prowling the corridors of power			1
@entity18 was appointed @entity46 to the @entity47 shortly after he was brought in to deal with the rodent problem on @entity6 in february last year			2
but his kill rate failed to meet @entity51 targets , and like his owner he became the subject of accusations that he spent too much time ‘ chillaxing ’			0
swiftly earning a reputation for napping rather than ratting , it took him 18 months to record his first confirmed kill			0
slinking back : @entity14 gloats as she returns back to her home ( left ) while @entity18 cuts a humble figure on the doorstep after his defeat a police officer looks the other way as @entity18 cowers in a window of @entity65 and @entity14 prowls along @entity6 then last month it emerged that @entity18 had been victim of a government reshuffle as the prime minister sacked him as @entity46 to the @entity47			1
mr @entity1 , who admitted @entity18 was a ‘ terrible mouser ’ , had apparently grown tired of his lethargy			2
he is thought to have found @entity18 dozing in the @entity27 study as a mouse ran across the room			0
the chancellor ’s tabby @entity14 was then given the role of @entity46			1
@entity14 , who arrived in @entity6 in june after going missing from mr @entity2 ’s previous home for three years , is thought to be an altogether more tough and street-wise predator and has been described as a ‘ lethal feline killing machine ’			0
after the pair ’s altercation just before 7am yesterday , @entity14 later walked past @entity27 to stare at @entity18 , who was seen sitting in the window while mr @entity1 held a @entity47 meeting inside			1
a @entity6 regular said : ‘ apparently they have not got on for a while , she has clearly taken over the turf			0
scuffles between them have been going on			0
’ when asked about relations between the two cats , the prime minister ’s spokesman said simply : ‘ they co-exist			0
’ @entity1 is said to have become exasperated by @entity18 dozing as mice run around @entity27 better neighbours : prime minister @entity1 , left , and chancellor @entity2 , right , own the cats and at least appear to get on better than the pair			2

the pm 's pet @entity18 and the chancellor 's cat @entity14 trade blows at dawn
a policeman looked on as @entity14 struck @entity18 at the throat
@entity18 was later seen cowering in the window
no 10 *refuses* to get drawn into the cat fight , saying the two pets ' co-exist '
