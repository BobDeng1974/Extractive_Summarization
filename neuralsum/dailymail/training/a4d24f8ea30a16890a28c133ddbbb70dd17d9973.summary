allegations : prosecutors said @entity1 , left , had a plan to kill then - congresswoman @entity7 , right , during a meeting with constituents in @entity65 prison officials in @entity67 , where @entity1 has been held , have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs to make him fit to stand trial			1

according to the indictment , a search of @entity1 ’s home yielded a letter stashed in a safe in which @entity7 thanked him for attending an earlier @entity44 on your corner event			1
also in the safe was an envelope with handwriting that said , ‘ i planned ahead ’ and ‘ my assassination ’ and @entity7 ’ name , ‘ along with what appears to be @entity1 ’s signature , ’ the indictment said			1

but shortly after his arrest , the 23 - year - old ’s mental fitness to stand trial has been called into question by his defense team			0
