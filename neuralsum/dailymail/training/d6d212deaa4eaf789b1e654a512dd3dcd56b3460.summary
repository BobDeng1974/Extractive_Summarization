by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 08:00 est , 27 march 2012 @entity2 should be forced to stop people flouting privacy injunctions online by censoring its search results , an influential report said today			1
so far the search engine has refused requests to filter out results that breach court orders like the one obtained by footballer @entity11			1
but a cross-party committee of mps and peers blasted the internet giant for its ' totally unconvincing ' objection to weeding out illegal information			1
@entity2 is under pressure from mps to crack down on the breach of privacy injunctions online it follows increasing concern about a series of high - profile cases last year where @entity25 privacy injunctions were repeatedly breached online			1
in the @entity11 case , the @entity27 and @entity28 star took out an injunction in april to prevent reporting of allegations that he had an extra-marital affair with model @entity34			1
but details and speculation about that injunction were spread so widely on social networking site @entity39 that eventually @entity41 mp @entity40 ' outed ' him in the @entity43			1
mr @entity44 used parliamentary privilege to name the player , saying 75,000 people had already identified him on @entity39			1
in december , the footballer settled his action against ms @entity34 , 28 , when he admitted his allegations that the former @entity51 contestant blackmailed him were untrue			2
in may last year , a committee was set up by prime minister @entity53 to examine privacy and free speech after the controversy			0
details of an injunction brought out by @entity11 , pictured here with his wife @entity60 , was spread over the internet despite the court order banning the use of his name @entity34 outside the @entity25 in december , when @entity11 accepted that there was no basis to accuse the reality star of blackmail in its report out today , the committee said sites like @entity2 , @entity73 and @entity39 present numerous challenges to the rule of law in the @entity76			1
it added : ' @entity2 and other search engines should take steps to ensure that their websites are not used as vehicles to breach the law and should actively develop and use such technology			1
' we recommend that if legislation is necessary to require them to do so it should be introduced			0
' mps and peers argued injunctions should routinely apply to websites such as @entity39 and @entity73 as well as newspapers			1
@entity2 had claimed that such a policy could threaten the unfettered flow of information online			1
the committee heard from former @entity99 boss @entity98 , centre , who claimed he has spent £ 500,000 trying to remove a video from the internet the company 's associate general counsel @entity104 said a mechanism that identified banned pictures or text would ' not be a good idea ' because it could not assess the context			0
but the committee concluded : ' we find their objections in principle to developing such technology totally unconvincing			0
' @entity2 and other search engines should take steps the ensure that their websites are not used as vehicles to breach the law and should actively develop and use such technology			1
' we recommend if legislation is necessary to require them to do so , it should be introduced			0
' last month cabinet minister won a gagging order to hush up ' private information ' concerning her teenage son			2
environment secretary @entity127 was granted the @entity25 injunction banning publication of a story about 17 - year - old @entity131 , a promising rugby player			2
the nature of the story can not be disclosed , but mr @entity134 said it contained ' sensitive personal information ' regarding which the boy was entitled to privacy			2
however he refused the minister 's application for her family to remain anonymous in the proceedings , citing the principle of open justice			0
it is thought to be the first time the courts have suppressed a story about the child of a cabinet minister since 1997 , when then home secretary @entity152 's son @entity151 bought drugs from an undercover reporter			0
mr @entity152 famously led his son to a police station to report his misdemeanour			2
in this case , there is no suggestion that privately educated @entity131 , who has represented @entity162 at under - 16s rugby , has done anything illegal			2
the committee heard evidence given by @entity98 , the @entity168 boss who said he had spent at least £ 500,000 in 23 countries attempting to remove traces of a video filmed covertly by the @entity173 video from the internet			0
it also urged the attorney general to be more willing to launch contempt of court claims against internet users if they are suspected of breaching privacy injunctions online			1
the @entity181 on @entity182 and @entity183 said people who ' actively seek publicity ' should accept there is ' enhanced interest in their private lives by the media '			0
however , the report stopped short of arguing for a new privacy law and instead set out recommendations for an ' enhanced ' press regulator			1
in a series of recommendations on the future of press regulation , the committee said a reformed @entity199 should have the power to fine newspapers and determine the prominence of printed apologies			0
it urged advertisers to withdraw funding from newspapers and major blogs that opt out of the reconstituted regulator , and threatened ' statutory oversight ' from a body such as @entity212 if the industry can not agree a credible package of reforms			0
@entity216 mp , chair of the committee , said : ' the committee spent some time debating whether additional laws to clarify the right to privacy were necessary or desirable			0
' however , we concluded that the existing position , where each case is judged by the courts on an individual basis , is now working reasonably well			2
' we are concerned that individuals with grievances about invasion of privacy should have an alternative to costly legal action available to them			0
' it is clear that media self - regulation under the @entity199 did not work			0
we therefore wish to see a stronger self - regulatory system that is seen to be effective and commands the confidence of the public			0
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' requiring search engines to screen the content of their web pages would be like asking phone companies to listen in on every call made across their networks for potentially suspicious activity			2

report blasts giant for refusing to filter information breaching court orders
it follows case of @entity11 , who was outed on @entity39 despite an injunction
mps also call for crack down on sites like @entity73 and @entity39 if they break the law
