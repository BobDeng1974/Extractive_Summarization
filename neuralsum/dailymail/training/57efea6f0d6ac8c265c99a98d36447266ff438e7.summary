@entity0 appears set to shelve plans to make her comeback next week at a low - key event in @entity4			1
the former @entity5 no 1 , whose last appearance came more than 12 months ago at the @entity8 , had been considering a return at a $ 25,000 lower - tier tournament at a place called @entity12 starting next monday			1
her agent , @entity13 , was quoted in @entity14 last month as pinpointing this as her comeback schedule ahead of making a return to the full @entity18 at the much higher profile @entity21 event in early march			0
@entity0 is not likely to appear in the lower - tier surprise , @entity4 , tournament as initially planned however , informed sources say that , while there has not been any major setback in her rehabilitation , her wrist is still not ready for the rigours of full - on competition			2
the 21 - year - old former @entity5 no 1 is adamant she wo n't rush back from a long - suffered wrist injury while @entity13 was not responding to inquiries , it is also suggested that it is far from certain that she will play at @entity21 or the @entity36 that follows it later next month			1
@entity39 was struggling with wrist problems from late 2013 onwards and in late april of 2014 underwent surgery , putting her in a cast for the rest of the summer			0
she was able to return to training and practice later on last year , working mostly in @entity47 , but as with all wrist injuries in tennis it has proved a torturously long process , and the watchword has always been caution			0
former @entity55 champion @entity54 is the most prominent example of this and has been plagued by issues off and on for nearly four years , having undergone surgery on both wrists			0
he played at the @entity62 event in @entity63 last month but then had to pull out of the @entity8 , and has subsequently had another minor procedure done on his left wrist			2
although she has found the hiatus in her career immensely frustrating , @entity39 is adamant that she will not be rushing back until she feels absolutely ready , although she is said to be doing plenty of hitting			2
a clue to her immediate plans could be found in a reply on her ever - lively @entity74 feed , which said she planned to go and see @entity76 this weekend			0
@entity39 's endured a frustrating recovery and has n't competed since last year 's @entity8			1

@entity0 was *due* to return to action at event in @entity12 , @entity4
the 21 - year - old has n't appeared since last year 's @entity8
despite being frustrated , @entity39 is adamant she will not rush back
