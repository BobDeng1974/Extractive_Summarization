by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 18:56 est , 10 march 2014 @entity2 has @entity3 , a condition causing extreme facial pain @entity2 was enjoying a meal with friends when she first felt the pain in the right side of her jaw			1
' it was a gradual thing , and i thought it must be toothache , so i made an appointment with my dentist a few days later			0
he thought it was a filling that needed changing , ' says @entity2 , 53 , who lives in @entity18 with her husband , @entity20 , a software architect , and their three children			1
' he replaced the filling and said the pain should start to settle , but it did n't			1
' i went back about a week later and this time he thought the tooth might be infected , and so decided to do root canal treatment on it			1
' root canal involves opening the tooth to remove bacteria from the soft tissue inside , and then filling the root of the tooth			1
it is notoriously uncomfortable and can take several hours - but for @entity2 it made things worse			1
' the pain became extreme			1
i was having difficulty talking or opening my mouth and painkillers did n't touch it , ' she says			0
the problem was , there was nothing wrong with @entity2 's teeth			1
in fact , she had trigeminal neuralgia , a condition where the trigeminal nerve - which runs through the face and sends pain messages to the brain - becomes damaged			1
@entity3 affects some 19,000 people in the @entity55 and is most common in the over- 50s			0
it causes bouts of severe facial pain , and as the condition is still not well known , these are often mistaken for dental problems with disastrous results			1
many patients endure years of unnecessary dental work - some patients have even had all their teeth removed			1
it took 2½ years - and an astonishing four sessions of needless root canal treatment on different teeth - before @entity2 was given the correct diagnosis			1
not only is trigeminal neuralgia often slow to be picked up , it 's thought to be one of the most painful conditions known to medicine			1
it 's even been called the ' suicide disease ' , because patients can begin to feel suicidal , so debilitating are the symptoms			2
many sufferers describe the pain as like an electric shock , but for @entity2 it felt ' like a knife stabbing into my jaw '			1
gp prescribed carbamazepine , an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain , and it got things under control the condition causes faulty pain messages to be sent , especially when the face is touched			2
the lightest touch - even a hair brushing against the skin or a gust of wind - can trigger the excruciating feeling , although it can also happen spontaneously			0
the neuralgia tends to strike for just a few seconds or minutes			2
' i could be sitting talking to a friend and the next minute be in tears with the pain , ' says @entity105 became difficult , too			2
' after the first root canal treatment , i could n't even put a cup to my mouth , ' @entity2 recalls			1
' at one point i was having soup through a straw			0
i lost about 2st in weight over a period of a few months because eating anything would set it off			0
' she saw her gp who prescribed carbamazepine , an anti-convulsant that helps with nerve pain , and that gradually got things under control			2
she also learned to eat on the left side of her mouth , avoided very crunchy foods like apples , and slowly regained some weight			0
but as various specialists struggled to work out what was causing the problem , @entity2 's ability to cope with the outside world started to shrink			1
' i could n't go out in cold weather or wind , as that would set it off ; sometimes even the vibration of walking on a gravel path would do it			0
i could n't go out to eat and was always worried that if i did go out i would have an attack , so i became very isolated			0
even the fear of it happening was enough to set it off			0
' @entity2 also hated the side - effects of her medication			1
' it left me drowsy and wanting to sleep all the time			0
as soon as i had it under control i 'd try to reduce the quantity , but if i did n't get it right the pain kicked in again			2
' the neuralgia also placed a strain on her family			2
' they were extremely worried about me - my life had completely changed and there was nothing they could do			0
my daughter recently admitted it was really frightening to see me in such pain			2
' eventually , in late 2010 her dentist referred her to the @entity166 where she saw professor @entity167 , a leading expert in trigeminal neuralgia			1
@entity2 was referred for an @entity169 on her head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed ' people had mentioned trigeminal neuralgia before but for some reason my dentist did n't believe that was what i had , ' says @entity2			1
' after examining me , professor @entity167 knew immediately that was it			0
it was such a relief to talk to someone who understood totally what i was going through			0
' there are two trigeminal nerves , one on each side of the face and each with branches that run around the eye , forehead , cheek , nose , jaw and mouth			1
trigeminal neuralgia seems to occur when the myelin - the material that insulates nerves - wears away , especially at the point where the nerve enters the brain , says professor @entity167			1
' all sensation is felt in the brain and interpreted in the brain , ' she explains			0
we think when the myelin is lost , there 's some cross circuit between the nerves , so a normal sensation like touch is wrongly interpreted by the brain as pain			2
' it 's an extremely severe pain , and although it lasts for only a few seconds it can feel continuous because it keeps happening in quick succession			1
' people with multiple sclerosis are at raised risk of trigeminal neuralgia , as this condition causes the degeneration of myelin			1
however most cases occur in otherwise healthy people due to a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve , wearing away the protective surrounding layer			2
it 's still not clear why this should happen in some people			0
the condition tends to be diagnosed over the age of 50 ( although it has been seen in younger people , and even in children ) and professor @entity167 speculates it may be a disease associated with ageing			2
and some studies have linked trigeminal neuralgia with high blood pressure			1
' it could be that hypertension causes greater pressure in the blood vessel next to the trigeminal nerve , ' she says			2
however there are still many unanswered questions surrounding the condition			0
' when you operate to move the blood vessel out of the way , 70 per cent of patients will be pain free , but not all of them , ' says professor @entity167			2
' also , if you scanned the brains of the whole population , you 'd see around 15 per cent of people have this blood vessel next to the nerve , but nowhere near that number have trigeminal neuralgia			1
' her team now wants to run genetic studies to see if this has a role			0
awareness of trigeminal neuralgia is improving , but @entity266 , of the @entity267 , says that misdiagnosis is still a huge issue			1
' the stories we hear really are quite horrifying			0
many people have teeth removed or root canal treatment ; we have heard from people who have had all their teeth out , though that 's unusual			2
' after seeing professor @entity167 , @entity2 was referred for an @entity169 on her head which confirmed the trigeminal nerve was being compressed			1
the number of people who take time off work for dental problems each year ' i 'd had an mri two years before , but it had shown nothing , apart from ruling out a tumour or multiple sclerosis			2
' this time they knew what they were looking for			0
the neurosurgeon said it clearly picked up the blood vessel pressing on the nerve , and so i 'd be a good candidate for surgery			0
' six months later , in the summer of 2011 , she had the two - hour procedure			0
surgeons made an incision just behind the ear and drilled through the skull to reach the trigeminal nerve			0
they then placed a pad made from @entity305 fibres next to the blood vessel , to stop it pressing against the nerve , so allowing the myelin to regenerate			0
@entity2 recovered in hospital for four days before going home			1
' it was fantastic , ' she says			0
' it took me a long time to be confident again about things like eating and exercising , because i was so scared of setting it off again			0
' but , touch wood , i 've been free of pain ever since then			0
' @entity319 , which is normally suggested only after anticonvulsants have been tried , can be successful for many but in some people the neuralgia can return			0
in this instance , they may be tried on anti-convulsants again , or they may be offered ablation therapy , where heat or radiation is used to destroy part of the trigeminal nerve itself			0
this carries a risk of long - term numbness in the face , but can provide relief from the pain for about four years			1
ablation therapy may also be offered to the minority of people with trigeminal neuralgia where there is no sign the nerve is being pushed against by a blood vessel			1
@entity2 is crossing her fingers she will remain pain free			1
' i consider myself lucky , ' she says			0
' and i appreciate things now - walking in the wind and seeing friends			0
but , of course , i do look back and think : “ did i really need to have all that root canal treatment ? ” ' contact the @entity267 @entity55 on 01883 370 214 or at @entity353			0

@entity2 , 53 , from @entity18 , had severe pain in her jaw
it took 2½ years and four needless root canals before she was diagnosed
painful , debilitating trigeminal neuralgia is often slow to be picked up
many describe pain as like an electric shock , even knife stabbing into jaw
