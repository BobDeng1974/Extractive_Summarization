by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 16:15 est , 24 february 2013 the 400 - year - old chapel in which the @entity3 sisters were baptised has been desecrated by stone thieves			1
crowbar - wielding looters ripped up two 200 - year - old burial slabs from the graveyard , wrenched stones from the chapel walls , and tore up part of the nearby @entity12 footpath			1
it is feared that they will have thrown away the irreplaceable marked gravestones when they realised they were among their haul of valuable @entity18 stone			2
desecrated : bare earth is exposed where thieves tore up a @entity23 stone burial slab outside by the old bell chapel in @entity25 , @entity23 volunteers have worked for 12 years to restore the cemetery and grade two - listed ' @entity29 ' , next to @entity30 in the village of @entity25 , near @entity32 , @entity23			1
although the @entity33 are more closely associated with the @entity34 a few miles away in @entity35 they were actually born in @entity25 where their clergyman father had his living from 1815 to 1820			1
all three of the literary sisters and their brother @entity42 were baptised in the chapel , where their father @entity44 preached his first sermon about the @entity47 ’s 1815 victory over @entity48 at @entity49			1
organised : it would have taken four men to carry away the two 200 - year - old burial slabs irreplaceable : the slabs bore inscriptions that were much more detailed than those on the headstones themselves @entity44 once described his years in @entity25 as ' the happiest in his life ' , before the family was torn apart by the premature deaths of its literary prodigies			1
on saturday , members of the action group set up to restore the site came along to tend the graveyard - and discovered thousands of pounds of damage			1
thieves had removed two horizontal grave slabs measuring six foot long by three foot wide and four inches thick - which would take four men to lift			1
greedy : the looters also took pieces of stone from fifteen other graves , and paving slabs from the @entity12 , a footpath linking @entity3 landmarks across @entity23 search : there are concerns that the thieves will have dumped the slabs once they realise their significance they had also taken slabs from the @entity12 , a footpath linking points of interest across the moorland that inspired @entity89			1
one of the graves marked the final resting place of tragic @entity92 and the five children who predeceased them in the 1820s			2
the other stone covered the plot of @entity98 and @entity99 and their 28 - year - old daughter @entity100 who were all dead by 1828			1
the thieves did not touch the actual headstones , but the inscriptions on the slabs were more extensive			1
pieces of @entity18 stone had also been removed from the top of 15 other graves			0
coping stones had been ripped from the chapel itself and much of the churchyard footpath torn up			1
restored : local volunteers had been working hard to restore the ' @entity115 ( pictured ) , of @entity116 in @entity25 historic : the @entity3 children were baptised in the chapel ( pictured as it was ) , where their father @entity44 was clergyman yesterday the attack was roundly condemned by the local people who had worked tirelessly to restore the site , @entity125 , and civic leaders			1
churchwarden @entity127 , the mastermind of the chapel restoration , was sickened			2
' we are proud of our achievements in making @entity29 and surrounding graveyard a place where people can now visit to enjoy its history , beauty and nature			0
literary genius : @entity138 by @entity3 ( left ) and @entity89 by @entity139 ( right ) are two of the greatest works of nineteenth - century @entity143 literature ' it is a historic site and it has been desecrated			1
this was a despicable and awful crime			0
thousands of pounds of stone have been stolen and the graves are irreplaceable			0
' the thieves probably dumped them in a hedge or threw them over a wall once they realised there were inscriptions which made them identifiable			2
' the action group of nine volunteers have put a lot of hard work in and are devastated			2
family : @entity161 by @entity162 ( left ) is still popular today			0
@entity44 ( right ) was parson in @entity25 between 1815 and 1820 ' it is absolutely disgraceful and disgusting			1
the morons who did this must be sick and have no respect for life , death or social history			0
' ' we were celebrating 400 years of its history this year and it has taken the edge off it			1
' the graveyard was the final resting place of many local worthies before the last plot was filled in 1965			0
the @entity33 were one of the most important families in @entity143 literary history			0
sisters @entity184 , @entity139 and @entity162 all began to write at an early age at their home in @entity35 , @entity23			1
their stories started as a game based around brother @entity42 's toy soldiers			0
@entity184 's @entity138 and @entity139 's @entity89 are regarded as classics of @entity143 literature			0
@entity162 's @entity161 remains a huge bestseller			0
@entity139 and @entity162 both died of tuberculosis in 1848 - 9 aged 30 and 29 respectively			2
@entity42 and @entity184 were also killed by the disease			0
their deaths added to the heartbreak of clergyman father @entity44 , who had already lost two younger children to tuberculosis and his wife to cancer			2
the gates are left unlocked to allow their ancestors to pay their respects and for families to enjoy the peace and quiet			0
the churchwarden added : ' what has happened has been devastating			0
the two graves taken are over 200 years old and were irreplaceable			2
' local stonemasons have been contacted but they do not hold out much hope of getting them back			0
' police patrols were stepped up around @entity219 on @entity220 after the damage was discovered			0
detective inspector @entity222 said : ' this is quite clearly a despicable act which will cause great offence in the local community			0
' police are aware of the theft of @entity23 stone and these gravestones from the church and have been in contact with officials there			1
' unfortunately , there are no positive lines of inquiry at this time despite investigations			0
' so we appeal to anyone who has information and furthermore , to any local stonemasons who are offered what are clearly gravestones to contact us			0
' councillor @entity245 , @entity246 ’s portfolio holder for tourism , described the sacrilege as ' sickening '			0
she added : ' @entity249 has a strong significance to the @entity3 story , and is a major tourist draw for the @entity32 district			1
people who commit these crimes throw away hundreds of years of history			2
