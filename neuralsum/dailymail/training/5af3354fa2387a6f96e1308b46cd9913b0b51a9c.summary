by @entity0 in a guest diary column for the spectator , @entity1 shows that she has a rather lively sense of humour as most authors would confirm , you ’re only as good as your last book			1
which is probably why @entity10 has been thinking hard about what she writes next			2
@entity12 of @entity14 ’s sister , known as much for her shapely derriere as her royal connections , says she has already come up with the perfect follow - up to her book celebrate ! ‘ maybe i should write a sequel and call it @entity22 , ’ she says in this week ’s edition of @entity20			1
‘ now that could be a bestseller			2
’ in a guest diary column for the magazine , @entity1 shows that as well as the shiny smile and glossy mane of a @entity10 , she also has a rather lively sense of humour			1
she acknowledges that her party - planning book , which she produced in a £ 400,000 publishing deal , has been widely derided as a bible of the blindingly obvious			1
@entity1 , 29 , seems to know about all the jokes			2
and she has a few of her own to add			2
‘ i have been much teased for my book , ’ she begins in the @entity20 column			1
‘ lots of journalists are saying that my advice is glaringly obvious			1
a spoof @entity41 account called @ pippatips offers such pearls as “ enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle ”			2
’ she admits the criticism is all good fun but points out that writing a guide means you have to cover the basics			1
‘ if i were to write a cookery book , for instance , i would be compelled to say that , to make an omelette , you have to break at least one egg			1
actually , that ’s not a bad idea			0
or maybe i should write a sequel and call it @entity63 ? now that could be a bestseller			0
’ the @entity20 , an intellectual weekly magazine first published in 1828 , might not come to mind as the natural platform for the thoughts of the gal from @entity68 , widely celebrated as a ‘ rear of the year ’ contender			0
this week , however , she joins the hallowed ranks of previous diarists including @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
and @entity1 really warms to her theme , using the spoof @entity41 account that pokes fun at her as inspiration for some @entity82 entertaining tips			1
inspired by @ pippatips , are my excruciatingly self - evident tips for festive entertaining in the workplace , ’ she writes			1
‘ 1 : choose , if you can , a @entity82 - themed menu			0
a turkey , for example , can be perfect for large gatherings			0
‘ 2 : do n’t not invite any members of staff , as this can cause offence			0
‘ 3 : keep speeches brief and cheerful : @entity82 is not a time to talk about redundancies			0
’ ' i have been much teased for my book , ' @entity1 begins in the @entity20 column			1
critics have said the @entity12 of @entity14 's sister stated ' the obvious ' with her party tips but as well as her tongue - in - cheek advice , her column also gives a glimpse of christmas chez @entity10 , revealing that her father @entity106 traditionally surprises the family by wearing fancy dress			1
‘ a couple of @entity111 ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit , ’ she discloses			0
( no prizes for guessing that such an outfit is available for hire from the @entity117 company the @entity118 run )			0
the column records variously that she recently landed two grilse on a fly - fishing trip in @entity122 ... that she is planning a running , cycling and kayaking triathlon in @entity126 ... and that she apparently has a soft spot for @entity128 , ‘ a man who exudes so much grace and beauty that he inspires anybody with a pulse , ’ as she puts it			1
last night those close to @entity1 insisted the @entity20 article was all her own work , and that she deliberately intended to send herself up			0
‘ it is completely intentional and good humoured , ’ a source told the @entity138			0
yesterday miss @entity10 was hard at work at a book signing in @entity142 , recently slashed to half price in some @entity145 outlets and outsold by such great works as the @entity147 and a @entity149 calendar			2
in a knee - length @entity151 peplum dress the colour of a @entity154 wrapper with matching purple suede heels , she posed in front of a store in @entity159 , stacked high with copies of her book			2
all these book signings have done wonders for her literacy skills , she confides in her @entity20 column			1
‘ i have finally perfected my signature			0
it took hours of practising			0
’ after @entity168 from @entity1			0

@entity12 of @entity14 's sister pokes fun at herself in a guest column for the spectator
she admits her literary *attempt* at a party planning book was regarded as full of blindingly obvious tips
