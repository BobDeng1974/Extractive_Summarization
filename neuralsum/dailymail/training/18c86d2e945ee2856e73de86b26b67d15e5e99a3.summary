hate preacher @entity0 has lodged an appeal against his deportation to @entity3 in @entity5 's highest appeal court - in a move which could keep him in @entity7 for months			1
home secretary @entity8 ordered his arrest yesterday after she secured a landmark deal which she hopes will see him sent to @entity3 to face terror charges			1
but his lawyers lodged a last ditch appeal in the @entity15 last night in an attempt to halt his deportation			1
scroll down to watch video @entity0 is driven from a @entity19 hearing in central @entity20 yesterday @entity22 staff arrive to collect @entity0 - one of whom appears to have his possessions in a black bin liner - before he is escorted out of the house in north west @entity20 and taken away in a car a spokeswoman for the court said the deadline for the appeal was midnight - and it was made after 11pm last night			1
she said : ' it was literally last minute			0
' as the situation descended into deeper farce , it emerged that the home secretary spent last night as a guest of celebrity agent @entity37 was was celebrating his 50th birthday			1
@entity41 's legal team claims that judges at the @entity15 were wrong three months ago when they ruled that he would not be at risk of torture if returned to @entity3 , a court spokeswoman said			1
the court 's @entity15 will decide whether to hear his appeal , but the radical cleric , once described by a judge as @entity52 's right hand man in @entity5 , can not be deported until the court has reached a decision			2
a panel of five will now meet to decide if the case can go before a @entity15 of 17 judges			0
the spokeswoman could not give any indication the whole process would take			0
the move comes as the 47 member nations of the @entity64 prepare to meet in @entity65 tomorrow for talks aimed at reforming the court and the types of cases it hears			0
home secretary : @entity8 may spebnt yesterday evening at celebrity agent @entity37 's 50th birthday mrs may admitted yesterday it could be ‘ many months ’ before the fanatic is put on a plane to his home country			1
@entity0 was given three months to appeal the @entity15 ' decision when they handed down their judgment on january 17			2
his appeal was received just after 11pm last night - april 17			2
however , the @entity83 claim that the deadline expired at midnight on april 16			1
a @entity83 spokesman said : ' @entity41 has no right to refer the case to the @entity15 of the @entity15 , since the three - month deadline to do so lapsed at midnight on monday night			1
' his case should be heard in @entity7 courts , as the home secretary outlined to @entity92 yesterday			1
in the meantime , he remains in custody			0
' yesterday within hours of his detention , @entity41 ’s lawyers were demanding he be let out again on bail and making it clear that they would do everything possible to thwart deportation			1
that could mean a string of further appeal hearings , adding to the £ 1.5million bill in legal costs and benefits already run up by @entity41 , who has links to convicted @entity112 terrorists			2
mrs may was forced to seek the deal with @entity3 following january ’s ruling by the @entity15 that he would not face a fair trial if sent home			0
the ruling also led to @entity0 ’s release on bail in february			0
since then he has been at his family home in @entity123 , north - west @entity20 , under strict bail conditions			1
the £ 1,900 - a - month rent on the house is paid through benefits , and a surveillance operation to monitor his every move cost @entity7 taxpayers £ 100,000 a week			0
just after midday yesterday , smirking @entity41 was led from his home by immigration officers and taken to a hearing of the @entity19 , in @entity20 , which rules on terror immigration cases			1
the hearing was delayed when @entity41 demanded a translator , although he has lived here since 1993			2
the judge , mr @entity138 , said he still posed a risk of absconding and denied bail			0
he indicated a full hearing could be delayed until october			0
it is likely a further application for bail will take place within days , but last night @entity41 , whose real name is @entity0 , was in @entity149 high security prison			2
next year will mark two decades since he first cheated his way into @entity7 on a fake passport , and nearly a decade since efforts began to remove him			0
yesterday ’s hearing was told that the @entity3 government had agreed to ‘ bend over backwards ’ to ensure @entity41 received a fair trial			2
five smartly dressed officers were in the house for around 15 minutes before emerging with @entity41 , who left the house and was not handcuffed the @entity15 found that sending @entity41 , 51 , back without assurances that torture evidence wo n't be used would be a ' flagrant denial of justice ' shadow home secretary @entity164 called for mrs may to explain the steps she was taking to deport the cleric the deal means that if returned @entity41 ’s earlier conviction in @entity3 , handed down in his absence , will be quashed			1
his new trial on terror charges will be heard in public with civilian judges , he will have full access to lawyers and will be able to summon defence witnesses			0
following the @entity182 ruling , which said torture evidence might be used against @entity41 at trial , mrs may and other ministers embarked on a frenetic diplomatic effort to secure the deal that would make deportation possible			2
mrs may insisted it would be impossible simply to put @entity41 on a plane at once as his lawyers would obtain a court order preventing deportation			1
@entity192 , counter-terrorism expert from the @entity193 , said : ‘ @entity8 deserves praise for her persistence and determination to expel @entity0 from the @entity7			0
he is a senior jihadist ideologue and his presence is clearly not welcome in this country			0
furthermore , the @entity200 must , as a basic principle , be allowed the legal freedom to deport national security threats			0
’ ministers insisted last night that @entity7 is on track to get a deal this week to curb @entity182 ’s human rights judges			0
despite suggestions that key proposals had been watered down or ditched , sources said justice secretary @entity210 expected to secure wins on measures to protect the importance of decisions made by national courts , to make the court more efficient and consider fewer cases , and on the nomination process for judges			0
