at a first glance these incredible images could be mistaken for portraits of our feathered friends , but on a closer inspection it 's clear to see they feature painted models			1
the set of fascinating photos was created by expert bodypainter @entity18 who transformed naked men and women into birds using nothing but a lick of paint and inventive photography			1
the peacock symbolises the search for a mate , the lovebirds perched on a branch represent the intimacy of a relationship , and the stalk delivering a baby stands for birth			0
the incredible images took eight months to plan , paint and perfect , and @entity18 juggled creating the collection with being pregnant with her first daughter @entity51			1
