by @entity0 published : 14:49 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 24 may 2013 found : convicted killer @entity1 , 44 , who went missing from @entity2 in @entity3 has been found by police and returned to the hospital blundering police allowed a convicted killer , dubbed the ' @entity8 ' to remain at large for 12 hours after he escaped a secure mental institution and spent the afternoon drinking in a gay bar , before finally being reported by members of the public			1
@entity1 , 44 , was detained indefinitely under the @entity14 after paralysing a gay man during a pub fight in 1989			1
a year later he killed a gay man who was a fellow inmate at @entity19 ’s @entity18 with his dressing gown cord , later claiming he was convinced his victim had turned him into a black dog			1
but on januray 1 , this year , he left his clothes in a pile at @entity2 , @entity3 , after asking to use the toilet during an escorted visit before disappearing			0
incredibly it took three hours after the initial report of his escape for officers to change his status to ' unlawfully at large ' and still no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled			1
an inquiry into the botched hunt for the twice - married @entity36 , found officers had failed to adequately assess the risk he posed to the public			1
@entity41 , @entity42 , has published the findings of her investigation into the police ’s response to @entity1 ’s escape , that happened on january 2 this year			1
in it she says the police were ' lulled away from recognising @entity36 ’s status as an escapee ' as they often receive reports of voluntary patients going missing			1
the reports says that it took three hours after the initial report for the police to change his status to ' unlawfully at large ' but even then no risk assessment was done and no photograph was released until about 10 hours after he had fled			1
' mr @entity1 was recognised by a member of the public less than two hours after a photograph was issued and was arrested with no difficulty , ' the report says			1
' it is of note that he , the killer of one gay man and who had slashed another ’s throat in licensed premises , was found drinking in company , in a renowned gay bar			1
drinking : the murderer apparently spent most of the afternoon in @entity77 gay bar before finally being found by police ' it seems likely that had the police not been lulled away from recognising @entity36 ’s status as an escapee , a timely risk assessment would have led to circulation of fuller information including a photograph and perhaps to his earlier recapture			1
' but ms @entity42 concludes the report by reassuring the public that the force has been in the process of correcting their failings			0
' my principal concern is to reassure the public that insofar as any aspect of the @entity41 role in this event fell short of what the public would expect , it has either been or is in the process of correction , principally through the force ’s own internal efforts , ' she said			0
this has included staff being trained in risk assessment and to understand the difference between voluntary psychiatric patients and those committed by the courts			0
performer : drag artist @entity117 was on stage at the time @entity1 was arrested staff at @entity77 said @entity1 could have spent all afternoon in the bar , adding that he did not seem to stand out despite being ' a bit vacant '			1
@entity117 , the drag artist who was performing at the time , described the moment the killer was taken away by police : ' he had been in there all night - he was chatting to one of the regulars who was buying him drinks			2
' he was just sat drinking a pint , nothing unusual , which was why it was so unexpected			0
' ten or 12 policemen came in and went up to the smoking terrace			2
there was no scuffle , he was just led away			0
' it was all over within about five minutes			0
as they took him out of the bar he came right past the @entity140 booth , but he did n't have much of an expression - he just looked as if he had resigned himself to the fact he was going to be taken back			2
' ' one of the group he was with saw the picture the police had put out on @entity147 and recognised his tattoos , ' @entity117 added			2
' he called the police			2
' there was quite a crowd outside because people had seen the police vans and there was a buzz for a while , everyone was talking about it			2
' a manager of the company which owns @entity77 said @entity36 could have been caught earlier if the photograph had been available			2
' although he looked a little different , his distinctive tattoos gave him away , ' @entity161 said			0
' he had been drinking in the bar most of the day , but as his photo was n't released till late at night no one knew who they were looking for			1
i ca n't believe that it was n't put out more quickly			0
' officers said they had concerns for @entity36 's welfare as he is diabetic			2
he has a pump fitted and police said he has enough insulin to last three days			0
he has previously been detained at high security psychiatric hospital @entity178 , joining high profile detainees such as @entity181			0
escape : @entity2 in @entity3 , where convicted killer @entity1 escaped on wednesday after pretending that he needed to use the toilet @entity1 has also been detained at @entity184 , @entity185			1
his life in detention has not been without incident			0
he married fellow patient @entity189 at high security hospital @entity178 but they divorced in 2000			0
@entity1 then began a secret romance with a nursing assistant @entity193 who worked on his ward at @entity184 high security hospital in @entity185			1
the pair reportedly wed at a social club in the hospital in november 2008			0
