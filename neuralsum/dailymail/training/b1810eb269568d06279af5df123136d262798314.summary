so @entity3 must have been very relieved to visit the dentist at @entity5 - and she even got to sleep through the whole procedure			0
the 23 - year - old panda was given an anaesthetic by the zoo â€™s veterinary team so that they could fill her lower canine with a dental composite			1
painless procedure : @entity3 was given an anaesthetic so she slept through the treatment after the procedure , the tooth was cured with a light to seal the filling , then the teeth were cleaned and more x-rays taken while the panda dozed			1
