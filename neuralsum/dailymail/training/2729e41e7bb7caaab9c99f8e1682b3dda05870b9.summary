by @entity0 published : 09:14 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:19 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 is undergoing its biggest effort to date in exhuming the victims of its bloody civil war , which took place from 1980 until 2000			1
an estimated 70,000 died in the conflicts as local @entity11 rebels called the @entity12 , fought against soldiers and paramilitary allies in the hills of the @entity16			1
a team of forensic anthropologists are currently working in @entity20 district in the @entity16 and expect to remove hundreds of bodies , mostly of women and children who were killed by government troops believing they supported the rebels			1
the grave contains the long - buried remains of two women and 13 children , and @entity56 believes the hand the team has just unearth is that of his mother			2
@entity56 was just nine years old when he was forced to watch as soldiers and their paramilitary allies dismembered and killed his mother and other women and children left behind by fleeing @entity12 rebels			1
civilians suspected of backing the rebels were hunted down and killed			2
two weeks later , troops and their civilian confederates caught and killed men from @entity82 's village , including his father			2
three decades later , this isolated corner of @entity3 is witnessing the biggest exhumation to date of victims of the nation 's 1980 - 2000 internal conflict			1
the worst of its carnage occurred on these hills between the @entity16 ridge and @entity95 jungle			1

just over half were slain by @entity11 - inspired rebels , over a third by security forces , the commission found			1
human rights activists blame politics , including resistance from the military , for the delay in exhuming the bodies			0
fifty criminal investigations were only launched into the killings in 2011 , said the prosecutor in charge , @entity149			0
in november , forensic anthropologists began their work in the @entity20 district and expect to remove 202 bodies in all - mostly women and children			2
at least 1,384 people were killed in @entity20 , an area slightly larger than @entity159 geographically but has only 6,000 inhabitants			2
people there are constantly uncovering bones but very few graves have been exhumed by professionals			2
the killing fields are an 18 - hour walk from the nearest road in a region known as ‘ @entity170 , ’ or @entity171			0
it is a place where health care , schools , police and other state institutions barely exist			0
there are no roads , electricity or phones			0
the hills are still patrolled by @entity12 rebels , and drug traffickers flaunt the state 's absence			1

there are no roads , electricity or phones in nearly all of the isolated region known as ' @entity170 ' - ' @entity220 ' survivor : @entity221 , said to be the oldest survivor of the conflict , rests under the shade of a tree in @entity32 , a village in @entity20 , an area where health care , schools , police and other institutions barely exist and where the hills are dominated by @entity12 rebels and drug traffickers protection : soldiers stand guard at an antiterrorist military base in @entity238 region of @entity239 - the gateway to the @entity20 region at the edge of a shallow pit , @entity82 provides security for the forensic team while armed with a worn @entity247 shotgun			1
he watches the technicians uncover a skull here , a swath of clothing there and finds himself overwhelmed by memories			0
‘ i drank my own urine to survive , ’ @entity56 remembers , having fled into the forest after his mother was killed			0
the exhumers gather the diminutive bones of children , 26 found so far in the district , in boxes made to hold sweet bread			0
@entity264 , 52 , still suffers from her 1984 horror , when she was gang raped by soldiers at the nearby @entity269 barracks			0
after rebels killed her husband , the soldiers came for her and her mother			2
her mother was murdered after the soldiers cut her breasts off , the customary way of marking a raped woman			0

the survivors are mostly on their own , and villagers say no one has received any mental health counseling rebuilding : @entity282 is embraced by her son @entity283 as his daughter stands by his side in their front yard in @entity20			0
@entity282 's first husband was killed in 1984 when the couple tried to escape from soldiers who accused villagers of collaborating with @entity12 rebels keeping watch : villager @entity45 has a @entity294 shotgun slung over his shoulder while he keeps am eye on the forensic team exhuming graves in @entity32 looking for a solution : @entity300 , right , visits paralegal @entity301 at the one - room schoolhouse in the @entity32 village in the hopes of help to find and exhume the remains of her father - in law proof : @entity311 provides a blood sample to a forensic biologist , hoping that his dna will help identify the remains of his disappeared father a forensic anthropologist , top left , works in a shallow , tennis court - sized pit where the investigating team unearthed the remains of 13 children and two women the poor conditions in the area were what prompted the poor farmers of @entity210 to initially welcome the @entity12 before the civil war			1
in 1965 , other @entity330 - inspired guerrillas had freed farmers there from grinding servitude , assassinating the two powerful ranchers responsible			2
the @entity12 persuaded farmers to abandon their homes and live in forest camps to avoid encounters with soldiers , but their rule soon took a sinister turn			1
wary of being discovered , the rebels prohibited people from lighting cooking fires , forced women to give birth in caves and killed children who did not keep quiet when soldiers neared , said @entity349 , an anthropologist who interviewed hundreds of survivors in the 1990s			1
today 's @entity12 only numbers in the hundreds , taxes the cocaine trade and still has a reputation for cultivating local farmers			1
@entity356 , a worker from the @entity358 government development agency @entity357 , said little has changed for poor farmers in @entity20			0
‘ the basic conditions that generated the internal armed conflict - poverty , exclusion , discrimination - are exactly the same as they were in 1980 , ’ @entity356 said .			0

more than 70,000 people died in the 20 - year - long @entity3 civil conflict between the government and @entity11 rebels
not until now have forensic teams been sent to exhume the mass graves hidden in the @entity16
the @entity12 movement *convinced* farmers to leave their homes and live in rebel encampments in the hills
*eerily* *similar* to @entity382 's @entity381 , the rebels proved as *ruthless* as the government they were *fighting*
just over half of the victims were killed by the @entity12 , over a third by government soldiers and allies
