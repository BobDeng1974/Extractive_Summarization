the mother and father of a eight - year - old boy who allegedly died of scurvy will no longer face criminal charges , prosecutors said today			1
@entity6 , 46 , and her husband @entity7 , 47 , had faced trial amid accusations of child neglect following the death of their son @entity12 in 2011			1
but @entity14 @entity13 heard today that the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) decided to drop the case against the @entity18 couple following a ' detailed review '			1
@entity6 , 46 , and her husband @entity7 , 47 , pictured outside @entity21 after the @entity15 dropped the case against them over the death of their eight - year - old son @entity12 district crown prosecutor for @entity28 said mrs @entity6 was too unwell to stand trial while saying it was ' not in the public interest ' to pursue the case against mr @entity33			1
' we have recently concluded a detailed review of the prosecution case against @entity7 and @entity6 , in relation to the tragic death of their son @entity12 , ' he said			1
' due to the very complex and serious nature of this case , expert advice and guidance has been sought from a number of sources by both the prosecution and defence teams			2
the case against the parents was dropped after lawyers concluded @entity6 was too ill to stand trial and it would not be in the public interest to pursue proceedings against her husband ' taking account of the very many factors involved , it is our view that @entity6 is unfit to face criminal charges on health grounds			1
' in relation to @entity33 , our conclusion is that it is not in the public interest to pursue a prosecution against him			1
' there are a number of public interest factors weighing against the need for a prosecution of mr @entity33 in this case			1
' these are related to concerns about his health and the likely effect of a prosecution on him , as well as the nature of the case and the likely penalty that a court would impose in the event of a conviction			2
' the couple denied any wrong doing and claimed that @entity12 had a medical condition which meant he was n't getting enough vitamin c. the @entity15 added its decision did not ' imply any finding concerning guilt or criminal conduct '			2
mr @entity28 added : ' the cps makes decisions only according to the test set out in the @entity96 and it is applied in all decisions on whether or not to prosecute			0
@entity98 used to affect anyone who was at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored			0
they would begin to suffer when they could not get enough vitamin c - vital for the body as it needs it to make collagen , a type of protein found in many different types of tissue , such as skin , blood vessels , bones and cartilage			0
without vitamin c , collagen ca n't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down			0
signs of the condition included muscle and joint pain , fatigue , red dots on the skin , and bleeding and swelling of the gums , which can lead to teeth falling out			0
in 1753 a @entity133 @entity132 surgeon , @entity131 , realised that citrus fruits - which have large amounts of vitamin c - could combat the condition and published a study on it			0
modern treatment involves taking vitamin c supplements and eating food that 's high in vitamin @entity143 ' as a result of our review conclusions , we have today informed the court the prosecution offers no evidence against either @entity7 or @entity6			1
' while criminal proceedings have now concluded , a coroner 's probe into @entity12 's death is yet to take place			1
his inquest was opened and adjourned three years ago			0
at the full hearing a coroner will be unable to apportion blame over the death due to law			2
however , is it is expected that the fact - finding mission will give an official cause of death as well as looking at the events leading up to the @entity166 was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea			0
but it is almost unheard of due to modern diets and health care			2
symptoms of scurvy are lethargy , spots on the skin , spongy gums and bleeding from the nose			0
treatment involves taking vitamin c supplements and eating food that 's high in vitamin @entity143 this should quickly reverse the harmful symptoms of scurvy , the @entity186 says			0
@entity190 such as cabbage , grapefruit , sweet potatoes , lemons , broccoli , limes and tomatoes are all good sources of the essential vitamin .			0
