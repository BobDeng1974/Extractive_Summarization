it 's perhaps the only opportunity most of us will have to ' visit ' two monuments to the great age of exploration - in considerably more comfort than their first inhabitants			2
@entity8 's @entity7 has created 3d explorable panoramas of the huts used by two fo the greatest @entity13 explorers - @entity11 and @entity14			1
the huts have been preserved by the intense cold - and offer an insight into the grim conditions faced by @entity14 and @entity11 a century ago			2
the panoramas were created by a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens			1
in the winter of 1913 , a @entity22 newspaper ran an advertisement to promote the latest imperial expedition to @entity13 , apparently placed by polar explorer by @entity11 the interior of the hut has remained as it was when the explorers set sights on the @entity31 @entity8 said its new @entity33 backpacks , which took more than a year to develop , were ‘ another step forward ’ in its plans to produce an interactive and comprehensive map of the world			1
the 40lb backpack holds up a number of 15 - megapixel cameras , an on - board hard drive , and enough battery to run for an entire day			2
cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured			2
at the launch earlier this month , the @entity47 company said : ‘ there ’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot			2
' @entity53 solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the @entity57 so anyone can explore them			0

' @entity8 's @entity7 blog has launched a 360 - degree 3d version of the huts			1
the company first created @entity7 imagery of @entity13 in 2010			0
' today we ’re bringing you additional panoramic imagery of historic @entity13 locations that you can view from the comfort of your homes			0
we ’ll be posting this special collection to our @entity88 site , where you can learn more about the history of @entity31 exploration , ' says @entity92 of @entity8			1
' with the help of the @entity94 at the @entity95 and the @entity97 @entity96 , we ’ve now expanded our 360 - degree imagery of the continent and are making views of many other important spots , such as the @entity102 , @entity11 's hut , @entity14 ’s hut and the @entity105 , available to people around the world			0
' this new imagery was collected with a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens — equipment typically used to capture business interiors through the @entity114 program			1
we worked with this technology because of its portability , reliability and ease - of - use ( our @entity7 trikes would n’t be much use in the snow )			0
for all its planes and vans mapping out the world , there have been places even @entity8 can not reach			1
now thanks to its latest weapon , the internet giant will be able to chart everywhere from the depths of the jungle to the narrowest city alley			0
the desolate exterior of @entity14 's hut illustrates the conditions the explorers had to face @entity11 's hut has been preserved exactly as it was for decades the @entity139 panoramas were created by backpack cameras with fisheye lenses equipment in @entity14 's hut : this new imagery was collected with a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens its backpack camera , which is carried by a trekker on foot , will be able to get to places that @entity8 wings and wheels can not			1
the device , a more portable version of its controversial @entity7 cameras , is able to go ‘ offroad ’ , potentially photographing and mapping everywhere from the base of the @entity57 to the top of @entity158			1
campaigners have warned that privacy risks being sacrificed in a commercial race between @entity8 and its rival @entity163 , which unveiled its latest mapping technology yesterday			1
the two are competing to produce three - dimensional maps and have deployed spy planes to photograph streets and homes			0
the planes will be able to operate in @entity22 skies without special licensing or permits			0
@entity8 has also used its @entity7 cars to gather ground - level panoramic photographs .			1

@entity178 camera can go ' offroad '
campaigners warn privacy is being sacrificed in race between @entity8 and @entity163
