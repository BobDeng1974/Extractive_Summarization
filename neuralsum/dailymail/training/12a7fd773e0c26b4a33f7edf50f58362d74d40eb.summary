by @entity0 @entity2 researchers have developed adapters that enable a smartphone to capture images of the front and back of the eye plenty of people put off eye tests because of the expense or the time it takes to see a specialist			2
but these problems could become a thing of the past as researchers have developed cheap adapters that let a smartphone take high - quality pictures of the front and back of the eye			2
they claim to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it and then store it as part of a patient ’s electronic records			1
‘ @entity35 for the eye , ’ said one of the developers , @entity31 , who is assistant professor of ophthalmology of @entity34			2
they believe their technology can increase access to eye - care services as well as to improve doctors ’ ability to advise on patient care remotely			1
current equipment used to photograph the eye costs tens of thousands of dollars and requires extensive training to use properly			0
some rural areas of the world do not have access to it at all			0
ophthalmology resident dr @entity49 , who is lead - author of the paper describing the technology , said : ‘ adapting smartphones for the eye has the potential to enhance the delivery of eye care - in particular , to provide it in places where it ’s less accessible			2
‘ whether it ’s in the emergency department , where patients often have to wait a long time for a specialist , or during a primary - care physician visit , we hope that we can improve the quality of care for our patients , especially in the developing world where ophthalmologists are few and far between			1
‘ imagine a car accident victim arriving in the emergency department with an eye injury resulting in a hyphema - blood inside the front of her eye			0
normally the physician would have to describe this finding in her electronic record with words alone			0
the researchers believe the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions			0
while microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available , they are time consuming			0
a view of the retina showing diabetic retinopathy associated with diabetes mellitus is pictured it 's a cheap adapter that lets a smartphone take high - quality pictures of the front and back of the eye			2
the gadget claims to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it			1
it could increase access to eye - care services as well as to improve doctors ’ ability to advise on patient care remotely			1
the device offers point - and - shoot ability in seconds , not minutes , with instant upload to a secure server to store patient records			2
first prototypes were built using inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers , leds , switches , universal mounts , macro lenses and even a handful of @entity127 bricks			1
a computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3d - printed versions , now dubbed @entity131			1
a clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the @entity135 , while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes			1
‘ smartphones today not only have the camera resolution to supplement those words with a high - resolution photo , but also the data - transfer capability to upload that photo securely to the medical record in a matter of seconds , ’ he explained			0
dr @entity49 believes the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions			0
while microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available , they are time consuming and inconvenient , he explained			0
‘ given the fast pace of patient care , he wanted point - and - shoot ability in seconds , not minutes , with instant upload to a secure server , ’ dr @entity49 said			2
so they started designing a pocket - sized adapter that makes the phone do most of the ‘ heavy lifting ’ and after several prototypes , found a combination of magnification and lighting elements that worked			0
‘ it took some time to figure out how to mount the lens and lighting elements to the phone in an efficient yet effective way , ’ said dr @entity49 , who built the prototypes with inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers , leds , switches , universal mounts , macro lenses and even a handful of @entity127 bricks			1
the scientists believe their technology can increase access to eye - care ( illustrated ) services as well as to improve doctors ' ability to advise on patient care remotely after successfully imaging the front of the eye , he focused on visualising the inside lining of the back of the eye , called the retina			1
‘ taking a photo of the retina is harder because you need to focus light through the pupil to reach inside the eye , ’ dr @entity49 said			0
he worked out the perfect distance and lighting conditions for a simple adapter that connects a conventional examination lens to a phone to do this			0
a computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3d - printed versions , according to the study , which was published in the @entity221 in @entity222			1
a clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the @entity135 , while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes			1
a small batch of adapters , currently dubbed @entity235 will be produced for distribution and will be available for purchase for research purposes only .			0

researchers from @entity34 , @entity241 , believe their adapters make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye
they claim their technology can increase access to eye - care services as well as to improve doctors ’ ability to advise on patient care remotely
first prototypes were made using inexpensive parts including leds , macro lenses and @entity127 bricks , while the current @entity235 device is 3d - printed
a clinical study of the quality of the images will be conducted and the gadget tested for its ability to track eye disease in patients with diabetes
