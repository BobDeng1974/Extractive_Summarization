@entity1 manager @entity0 has labelled @entity6 ' exceptional ' after the former @entity2 forward wreaked havoc on @entity4 at the @entity5			1
@entity6 scored one and could have had a second were it not for an offside ruling during @entity1 's 3 - 2 win on saturday , and @entity0 feels his summer signing is repaying his reported Â£ 3million cost			1
the 24 - year - old joined from @entity2 in july on a four - year deal , and nabbed his second @entity16 goal this season as @entity18 's @entity4 left @entity1 with nothing			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 has labelled former @entity2 starlet @entity6 an ' exceptional ' player @entity6 scored one ( pictured celebrating ) and could have had a second were it not for an offside ruling the 24 - year - old joined from @entity2 in july on a four - year deal and helped @entity1 beat @entity4 3 - 2 ' it was an outstanding second goal by @entity6 , who once again has put in a really impressive performance , ' @entity0 said			1
' i think since he 's come back into the side he has played four or five games and i think he has been our man of the match in every game he 's played since he 's come back			1
he 's playing exceptionally well			2
' he 's showing everybody that not only is he a good player technically but , in terms of his work rate and what he tries to do for the team , he 's very much a team player as well and we 're reaping the benefits of that			0
' he 's integrated very , very well because he 's a good personality as well , works hard every day to get better and works hard for the team			0
' @entity6 would have had a brace when his shot from distance crept in but @entity50 was flagged for offside , the linesman deeming the striker to be interfering with play			0
@entity18 's @entity4 left the @entity5 with nothing as @entity53 beat the @entity54 3 - 2 on saturday but manager @entity0 feels @entity6 was denied a perfectly legitimate goal			1
' it was a really disappointing decision of the referee to chalk out an outstanding individual goal by @entity6 , created by himself , ' @entity0 continued			0
' you really should look to encourage positive play rather than look for a reason to penalise us			0
' so we 've gone from a situation where we could have been 4 - 0 up , that puts a spring in their step and very quickly we 're looking at 3 - 2 and we 're hanging on when the game should have been dead and buried			2
' but we 've got ourselves together and for the most part we saw it out quite comfortably			0
' @entity1 manager @entity0 felt summer - signing @entity6 was denied a perfectly legitimate goal to nab his brace			1

@entity1 manager @entity0 has hailed summer signing @entity6
@entity6 scored one and was denied a second during 3 - 2 win over @entity4

' i think he has been our man of the match in every game he 's played since he 's come back , ' adds @entity0
