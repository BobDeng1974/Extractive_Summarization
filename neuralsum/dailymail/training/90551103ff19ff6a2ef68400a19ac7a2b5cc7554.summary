by @entity0 @entity2 ’s flagship restaurant in @entity3 has been given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers			1
the four - star @entity6 , which is on the 25th floor of @entity9 , although it has now been revealed they failed a visit by the @entity13 in march			0
the abysmal rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure , confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary			1
@entity2 's flagship steakhouse , on the 25th floor of @entity9 in @entity3 ( pictured ) , has been given a zero rating by food safety inspectors a restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating , but said staff are working with the council to address the issues the restaurant boasts stunning views of @entity3 , and costs around £ 50 per head			1
a @entity34 spokeswoman said : ' @entity2 was informed their @entity13 rating would drop and it has been published on the @entity13 website			1
' a certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on march 25 , 2014			1
' despite the bad review , a spokesman from @entity2 said they have acted on what needed addressing and continue to work closely with the council			1
the spokesman said : ' we can confirm that we received a visit from the @entity50 of @entity34 earlier this year			0
' the feedback was provided in an informal manner by the eho with some recommendations			0
' these were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive			0
' we continue to work closely with @entity34 and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice			0
' @entity2 trained with @entity64 and @entity65 at @entity66 and @entity64 once described him as ' my little bunny ' the zero rating will remain valid , until the date of the next inspection , which could be between six and 18 months ’ time			1
the restaurant can call inspectors back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved , but so far the @entity13 have not revisited			1
the @entity6 joins a list of 140 eateries in @entity3 with a zero rating			2
the @entity34 spokesman added : ' in @entity3 most food business operate to a good standard , but if they fall below satisfactory standards , our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve			2
' where premises pose an imminent risk to health - eg where there is an active rodent infestation , severe drainage problems or filthy conditions - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has rectified the problems			2
the restaurant , where meals cost roughly £ 50 per head , serves up 28 day aged ' native beef ' steaks ( file pic ) ' this usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs			1
' on average , we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year			0
' therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly			2
' the news comes just a week after it was revealed @entity122 's upmarket butcher @entity123 , in the @entity119 , was forced to close after failing a health inspection			2
on that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings , out of date wagyu steak and mouldy cow carcasses			0
@entity123 , next to @entity129 in the @entity119 , shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it ' hazardous '			1
@entity132 was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including wagyu beef , oxtail , onglet , and @entity139 - style pork called @entity140			0
dirty slicers and vacuum packers were also found , as well as a ' heavy presence ' of mouse droppings			0
old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed was found to be relabelled with a later use - by date			0
