by @entity0 at last a comprehensively good day for @entity1			1
a come - from - behind victory — a rare thing indeed in this troubled season — and a pre-match show of bravado clever enough to earn some new respect from the @entity8			0
@entity1 has at times shown himself a little awed by his first season at @entity11			1
not on this occasion , though			0
the @entity11 manager ’s pre-match walk down the touchline ahead of his team ’s emergence from the tunnel could have backfired dreadfully			2
one - nil ! @entity1 won a personal victory after receiving support from @entity11 fans at @entity22 respite : @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and a first goal from @entity27 helped @entity11 to a 4 - 1 victory over @entity29 damp squib : a fly - by protest calling for @entity1 to be sacked was largely met with derision at @entity22 @entity1 , though , had judged the mood of his crowd better than the media and certainly better than the classless goons who dug in to their pockets to hire a plane trailing a banner denigrating their manager above the stadium at kick - off			1
the @entity8 ’s applause was generous and genuine			0
they respect a bit of ‘ front ’ in @entity47			0
they got used to it during 27 years of sir @entity50 and here was a bit of @entity54 gallus from their new man			0
@entity56 : calls to remove @entity1 ' @entity59 banner were also ignored teenage kicks : @entity61 came on to unlock @entity29 's defence with a through ball for the final goal @entity1 is yet to name the same starting xi in two competitive games			1
this was his 47th different starting team			0
it made for superb theatre and @entity11 ’s subsequent victory would have pleased @entity1 , too			1
trailing early , they could have capitulated , given their recent dismal efforts at home			0
here , though , despite some more suspect defending , @entity11 muddled through			2
a 4 - 1 scoreline perhaps flattered them a little			1
@entity76 wo n’t be too worried ahead of tomorrow ’s @entity78 quarter - final game at @entity22 but @entity11 left back @entity79 at least struck a positive tone			1
‘ if we lose a game we should n’t be looking at the manager , it is the team , ’ said @entity79			2
‘ today we fought for each other , the fans and for the gaffer			0
we have a very important game on tuesday and it was great for our confidence that we beat @entity29			1
if we had lost the confidence would have been low but now we have a good feeling			0
’ @entity94 engineering : @entity11 will be more severely tested when they face @entity76 in the @entity78 @entity96 courage : @entity79 ( @entity25 ) will line up to play against @entity76 in the absence of @entity98 with @entity98 suspended for the game , @entity79 will start against the @entity101 champions			1
this is where the bad news starts			0
@entity1 ’ team can score goals — they created some good ones on saturday — but they look vulnerable through the centre of the defence and @entity76 wingers @entity111 and @entity112 will certainly be enthusiastic about getting at @entity113 and the @entity115 @entity114 , if he recovers from the thigh injury that forced him off at half - time on saturday			1
@entity11 remain short of numbers at the back and the timing could n’t be worse			2
@entity121 , supposed to be resting ahead of tomorrow , was forced on as an emergency central defender at half - time against @entity29 as @entity124 shuffled across to replace @entity114			1
injury blow : @entity11 defender @entity114 ( r ) could also miss the game after being taken off with a knock wing men : @entity11 's defenders will have to deal with @entity111 ( @entity25 ) and @entity112 ( r ) be afraid ! @entity76 have already sewn up the @entity101 with seven league games to go leading 2 - 1 at the time , @entity11 should have been pegged back on two occasions , @entity132 wasting both opportunities , and this is what will worry @entity1 more than anything ahead of a two - legged tie against a team that has won 27 of its last 30 games			1
‘ i ’ve never played against @entity111 before and i have n’t watched videos or anything like that to study him but i know enough from what i have seen to know how he plays the game , ’ added @entity79			1
‘ this kind of big game is why you play football			0
it is what it is all about			0
it would be good for my career if i could do well against him			0
’ whatever happens tomorrow , @entity79 ’s career at @entity11 will end this summer			1
the @entity96 defender is sadly not quite good enough			0
@entity157 : @entity79 is unlikely to remain at @entity22 beyond this season as @entity11 begin plans for rebuilding headstrong ! @entity132 missed several chances against @entity11 ... the @entity94 will not be so profligate good luck with that ! @entity164 ( r ) has warned @entity11 that they will not have much possession against @entity76 for @entity166 , however , the next 10 days or so will be critical			1
nobody expects @entity11 to get past the defending champions and , remarkable as it sounds , defeat with honour would be acceptable			2
another pounding , though , may still prove fatal for the @entity11 manager			2
on saturday @entity76 ’s scouts will have seen a typically determined performance from @entity24 and some improvement from @entity27 and @entity177			2
villa manager @entity164 , once a @entity101 player , struck a salutary note , though			1
‘ @entity11 are going to be without the ball for a long time , that ’s a big thing , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s going to be really tough			0
you would n’t back against @entity11 but they are going to have to play — over two legs — one of the best teams in @entity188			0

@entity1 earned a reprieve after @entity11 defeated @entity29 4 - 1
@entity22 fans showed their support for @entity1 , despite a fly - by protest
@entity11 face a sterner test when they face @entity76 on tuesday
@entity79 will be asked to mark @entity111 with @entity98 out
the @entity94 are regarded as the best side in their *history* and have already won the @entity101
@entity164 has warned @entity11 they wo *n't* see much of the ball
