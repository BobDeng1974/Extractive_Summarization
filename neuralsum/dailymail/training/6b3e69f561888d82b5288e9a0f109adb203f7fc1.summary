by @entity0 published : 16:22 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 4 october 2013 it is the latest in the ' poopertrator ' saga that has left @entity4 college students bewildered and angry			1
@entity6 students were woken in the early hours of this morning to find a laundry line of soiled t - shirts , pants and towels hung across campus			0
not only that , but at 3.35am students received an anonymous email from the alleged ' poopertrator ' to inform them of his latest ' masterpiece '			2
students at @entity17 , which is one of @entity20 ' residential colleges , received the email from ' @entity21 ' which said : ' last time , i promise			2
' dirty laundry : @entity26 it may be , but someone at @entity4 is causing a stink it was signed ' forever yours , @entity31 ' and included three photographs of the items of clothing with what looked like feces smeared over them , the @entity29 reports			1
in a 10:32am follow - up email , the anonymous ' poopetrator ' sent another photograph of the line of soiled clothes with the comment : ' it ’s still a good morning ! ' news of the ' poopertrator ' made headlines earlier this week after someone at @entity46 residential college had been urinating into washing machines and even dropping their feces in			1
the matter was brought to campus officials ' attention after a student brought physical evidence of the crime to the @entity46 master @entity56 's office			0
according to the @entity29 , the pooper has been on the loose since early september , but it was n't until student @entity59 showed the evidence - her soiled laundry - to college authorities that @entity4 police joined the search			1
they have not yet commented about the line of dirty clothes			0
on september 7 , @entity59 went to @entity46 's laundry room to collect her clean washing from a dryer after it had already been urinated in the laundry earlier in the day			1
she had rewashed the clothes , but when she removed her clothing from the dryer she realized that they were covered in feces			1
' i simultaneously wanted to throw up , cry and punch someone , ' @entity59 told the @entity29			0
the serial - pooper quickly became the talk of @entity78 , with students dubbing the trending scandal # poopgate2k13			0
it seems that while not engaged in intellectual pursuits , a person , almost certainly a @entity4 student , had been throwing food and urine into dryers for some weeks before @entity59 's dryer discovery			1
the recent escalation to fecal matter has college residents watching their clothing for the entire dryer cycle , and some campus colleges fear a spate of copy - cat laundry poopers			2
some students , however , are unconcerned about the nefarious laundry - soiler and ' @entity100 ' parties have been thrown around the university			0
exclusive : @entity4 is one of the nation 's most sought - after colleges and others have taken a more academic approach to the issue			1
' leave it to @entity29 , @entity110 , and the @entity4 administration to miss a work of art , even when it hits them like a stinking pile of s * * t. this is clearly an act of the avant - garde , not a criminal mind , ' wrote a commenter on @entity29 , only identifying themselves as ' @entity121 '			2
' defying bourgeoisie standards of etiquette , and destabilizing the hegemonic " clean / dirty " binary ( which itself is underpinned and constructed by hidden economic , racial , and gender ideologies ) our intrepid defecator ( though perhaps we can not assume that the artist recycled his or her own byproduct ) juxtaposes the filthy with the sanitary , making the thought - provoking suggestion that we are all full of it , always and at all times , even at our most pristine , ' wrote the former student and consummate stirrer			0
according to the @entity29 , there have been at least four separate incidents involving human feces in the @entity46 laundry			1
' we have asked our students not to leave their laundry unattended , the affected machines have been thoroughly disinfected , and we are actively seeking information about who the perpetrator might be , ' @entity56 told the @entity29			0
dryer disaster : many students have had their clothing ruined by someone throwing food waste , urine and feces into the dryer with their clean clothes @entity56 also sent an email addressing the matter to students : ' @entity159 , ' he wrote			1
' someone has been doing weird , creepy , and ( frankly ) disgusting things in the @entity162			0
if you have observed something of this nature , or know who the perpetrator might be , please let me know			0
i ca n’t imagine why someone would do these things , but it has got to stop , and we will take measures to be sure it does			0
' student @entity176 told the @entity29 that students have been standing watch over the dryers to ensure their clothes do n't get ruined , and that many students think the college should employ 24 - hour security guards in the laundry			2
' it ’s ruining people ’s quality of life , ' she said			0
the search continues for the @entity4 poopertrator - and when he or she is found , the poop will surely hit the fan .			1

someone at a @entity4 residential college has been urinating and throwing human feces into dryers with other people 's clean clothing
there have been more that four incidents over the past month
@entity4 police are now searching for the person dubbed the ' poopertrator '
