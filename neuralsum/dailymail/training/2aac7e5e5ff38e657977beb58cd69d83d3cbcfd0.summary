from @entity1 to modern day murder mysteries , the nation is gripped by the ins and outs of major crime cases			1
but , with the gritty details of forensic examinations and police investigations often remaining out of the public eye , it 's usually left to tv dramas such as @entity12 and @entity13 to fill us in on what really happens behind closed doors			2
however , soon we will be able to get close to the experts who started it all , because a new exhibition featuring historic figures from the world of forensic medicine is set to launch - and it will feature never - before - seen case notes of autopsies as well as prototypical mug shots from the @entity26			1
never - seen - before handwritten autopsy index cards by notorious forensic pathologist sir @entity28 will form part of the hotly - anticipated ' forensics : the anatomy of crime ' exhibition , which will run for four months at @entity36 's @entity35 museum in 2015 the exhibition , which examines the history , science and art of forensic medicine , will run from february until june and will feature an array of ancient artefacts and artwork including the first prototypes of mug shots , dating back to the 19th century , by @entity47 several artworks will also be on display , including this 18th century watercolour showing the decomposition of a @entity53 noble lady the exhibition , called ' forensics : the anatomy of crime ' , will even include a literal murder scene - the floor tiles on which a friend of @entity56 artist @entity55 was killed			1
set to launch at @entity36 's @entity35 museum next february , the exhibition examines the history , science and art of forensic medicine and will bring together all manner of macabre treasures , including artworks and artefacts dating back as far as the @entity73			1
among the displays are intricate 18th century @entity53 watercolours capturing the decay of a dead noblewoman , and prototypical mug shots from forensic pioneer @entity47 alongside their 1970s identikit progeny			1
however , the most anticipated exhibits are likely to be a selection of never - before - seen case notes handwritten by notorious forensic pathologist sir @entity28			1
the yellowing index cards document some of the 20,000 autopsies sir @entity28 performed during his career , which spanned some of the most gripping whodunnits of the early 20th century			0
his profile was such that the satirical journal @entity95 featured his portrait in a 1928 issue , on display in the exhibition , declaring : ' when arsenic has closed your eyes , this certain hope your corpse may rest in : sir @entity102 will kindly analyse the contents of your large intestine			0
' @entity106 , curator of the @entity35 exhibition said : ' i get the impression that perhaps it became a default to go to @entity28 rather than anyone else			1
' @entity113 's reputation did become damaged towards the end of his career , i do n't think that necessarily means that he got everything wrong			0
' i think he probably just got a little bit too caught up in his own ego and then perhaps was n't doing as much of a thorough job as he should have been			0
' judging by his workload , he probably had far too many cases			0
' @entity106 , the exhibition 's curator , studies the @entity125 ( @entity126 ) - a book printed in 1491 by @entity128 the 15th century botanical book , which was printed in @entity130 in @entity131 by @entity132 , will be on display for all to see many suspect that sir @entity28 made serious blunders during his career , including in what was arguably his best known case - the trial of dr @entity140			1
the @entity142 - born doctor was convicted at the @entity143 in 1910 of poisoning his wife @entity144 following her disappearance , and sentence to be hanged			0
investigators discovered human flesh in his cellar that sir @entity28 testified must have come from the missing mrs @entity140 , all but delivering @entity140 to the gallows			0
but nearly 100 years later , @entity142 scientists called the pathologist 's findings into question , with dna testing revealing the flesh had more than likely belonged to a man			0
whether or not the gruesome find in @entity140 's home did indeed belong to his late wife , ms @entity106 - who has spent nearly three years poring over the documents in the forensics exhibition - does not believe an innocent man was hanged			1
' ( @entity140 ) was definitely up to no good , ' she said			0
handwritten autopsy index cards document some of the 20,000 autopsies sir @entity28 performed during his career in the @entity167 the autopsy notes will give visitors a never - before - seen insight into the world of forensic medicine dating back to the @entity73 the exhibition will give the public an insight into forensic medicine , which is normally divulged on tv in dramas such as @entity12 ( above ) the success of @entity181 drama @entity13 ( pictured ) only highlights the appetite for murder mysteries and crime solving in @entity185 ' he had a mistress , he had a reason to leave the country , so it must have been fairly serious			1
' there are a lot of question marks that are left hanging , but i 'm sure he was n't squeaky clean			0
' though sir @entity28 's notes on the @entity140 case are not among the thousands owned by the @entity35 , the forthcoming exhibition will feature press clippings and courtroom portraits from the trial			1
the public will also get a rare glimpse at lesser - known cases pursued by sir @entity28 , including that of young @entity207 , who died when she had dry shampoo applied at the @entity210 hair salon in 1909			2
ms @entity106 said there may well be whispers , hidden in the trove of terse post-mortem examination notes , of innocent men sent to their deaths thanks to sir @entity28 's testimony			2
' it would be an interesting task for a present - day forensic pathologist to undertake if somebody had an interest in reassessing his work , ' she said			2
' we worked quite closely with a coroner at the beginning of the exhibition as a consultant , and i took him to see the @entity28 cards			0
' he was absolutely bowled over			0
a series of 18th century watercolour paintings will form part of the ' forensics : the anatomy of crime ' exhibition in @entity36 next year the exhibition at @entity35 – the museum of medical history and oddities in @entity241 , - runs from february 26 to june 21 ' he 'd read so much about them , heard so much about them in the field , but never actually seen them - so i 'm sure there are a lot of people who would love to get their hands on them			1
' @entity253 , head of public programmes at @entity35 , said the museum was looking forward to welcoming new visitors following its £ 17.5million expansion			2
he said : ' forensics ' reminds us of the human body 's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance			0
' this unsettling truth is the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination			0
' challenging , affecting , at once familiar and disquieting , it 's a perfect subject for @entity35 to explore as it welcomes visitors to its new expanded spaces			2
' the exhibition at @entity35 – the museum of medical history and oddities in @entity241 - will run from february 26 to june 21 .			1
