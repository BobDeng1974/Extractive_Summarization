by @entity0 published : 13:15 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 18 february 2013 warning : @entity1 television chef @entity2 has added fresh squirrel to the menu of one of his restaurants			2
@entity7 braised in a tomato and red wine sauce is being served up to customers at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the unusual dish comes as the food world is still reeling from the horsemeat scandal but its inclusion on the menu conforms to @entity2 's belief in promoting wild food from sustainable sources			0
he says the meat has a gamey flavour , similar to rabbit			0
@entity40 squirrel is plentiful and widely regarded as a pest by both farmers and growers and conservationists but it has yet to catch on as a delicacy among foodies			0
' it will be interesting to see how the guests react to it , because it is nice for us to offer something different , ' said front of house manager @entity54			0
sustainable : sous chef @entity35 , left , says the squirrel dish shows @entity11 does not play safe but its inclusion also conforms to found @entity2 's , right , belief in promoting wild food seven squirrels were shot at @entity11 and it took chef @entity35 an hour and a half to butcher them it took mr @entity35 an hour and a half to butcher the seven squirrels , yielding a modest amount of meat			1
he said : ' you 'd need one and a half squirrels for a main course			2
that 's why we are serving it as starters			0
' the sous chef adapted a recipe for braised rabbit from @entity2 's meat book , using squirrel in its place			1
the squirrel joints are marinated with red wine and juniper berries for 24 hours , both to tenderise the meat and to give it flavour			1
they are then cooked very slowly with root vegetables and onions in red wine and tinned @entity92 tomatoes until the meat is tender			1
the chef says squirrels have a gamey flavour and the recipe was adapted from one for rabbits appetising : the grey squirrel does not give much meat and one and a half animals are needed for a main course although they are only being used as a starter now , mr @entity35 says they could feature on the menu again in the autumn when the squirrels are more plump			2
he said : ' that is when they are at their heaviest , after they have been eating nuts and fruit all summer			0
' you 're meant to eat squirrel in the late summer or autumn , because that 's when they are at their heaviest			0
' he said the inclusion of squirrel also silences critics who say the menu at @entity11 is ' too safe '			2
the joints are cooked with root vegetables and onions in red wine and tinned @entity92 tomatoes			1

the squirrels are shot at @entity11 and served used as starters
they are braised in tomato and red wine and cooked with root vegetables
sous chef @entity35 says it shows they are willing to take risks
