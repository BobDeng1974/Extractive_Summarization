by @entity0 published : 08:28 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 12 april 2013 ever since the first bride appeared in an over-sized crystal - embellished dress , viewers of @entity3 's @entity2 have been wondering exactly where the travelling community finds the funds to pay for them			2
now , their questions are to be answered in a new documentary , @entity11 , which reveals the secrets of the traveller economy and explains how the system has produced some of the very poorest people in society as well as some of the richest			1
the show , which goes out on sunday night , follows two very different members of the traveller community , starting with 15 - year - old @entity22 , @entity23 , whose father , also called @entity23 , is worth more than £ 100 million			1
at the other end of the income scale is fellow @entity28 and former x-factor wannabe @entity37 , who lives in a tiny caravan and has to ' graft ' for every penny he gets			1
@entity37 , who made the news for all the wrong reasons when he was given 200 hours of community service after admitting five counts of fraud in 2011 , has , like @entity23 , turned to ' hawking ' or selling door - to - door to keep himself going			1
despite making heavy weather of teaching 10 @entity63 apprentices to create her spectacular wedding gowns in her own spin - off show , @entity60 's @entity66 , dressmaker @entity60 also appears on the show to explain why gypsies are being unfairly maligned			2
' this misconception about all travellers being on the dole is the biggest load of c * * * i 've ever heard , ' says the straight - talking @entity75			2
' all these men are self employed			0
they do n't work for anybody else			0
even if they 're going round getting scrap and doing things like that ... jobs that we probably do n't want to do ! ' hardworking : according to dressmaker , @entity60 , travellers work harder than most extravagant : @entity88 ( left ) gave his eldest daughter @entity89 a wedding with eight bridesmaids and 300 guests i think this gets up people 's noses as well because we 've become lazy in our society			0
we sit there and wait for someone to say : " here 's a job "			0
' they get up of their bums and go and look for that work			0
' my @entity11 also meets @entity106 , who spends her time blinging up household goods and selling them on , and her husband @entity108 , whose dream is to breed dogs to take part in the gypsy pastime of ' lamping ' , or catching rabbits with dogs			0
last but not least is @entity88 , who is planning a wedding for his eldest daughter @entity89			0
like the stars of @entity2 , @entity88 is planning a lavish bash for @entity89 , complete with eight bridesmaids , 300 guests and a huge white dress			1
none of this will come cheap , but @entity88 is determined that his daughter has nothing but the best and says that @entity86 have a ' secret way ' of financing their larger - than - life nuptials			2
so what exactly is this secret ? you 'll have to wait until sunday night to find out ! my big fat @entity11 , 9pm sunday 14th april on @entity3 lavish : according to @entity88 , travellers have a ' secret way ' of funding extravagant weddings like @entity89 's extravagant : @entity88 plans to give his daughter @entity89 a wedding with eight bridesmaids and 300 guests			1

new tv show stars @entity23 , 15 , whose father is worth £ 100 million
