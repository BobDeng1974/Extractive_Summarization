a secret desert camp used by @entity1 has been found intact almost 100 years after he left it			1
the hideout in modern - day @entity5 was still littered with spent cartridges and broken gin bottles when a team of archaeologists found it - thanks to an @entity13 pilot 's vaguely - sketched map			1
it was used as a vital base by @entity1 , the @entity16 intelligence officer who would pass into legend for his guerilla raids against @entity20 forces in the @entity21			1
a piece of history : this photograph of an armoured @entity25 helped researchers track down a desert camp ( pictured ) from which @entity1 launched guerilla attacks on @entity29 - allied @entity20 find : @entity16 archaeologists have found a secret desert camp used by @entity1 , pictured , almost 100 years after he left it with a campfire and empty tins of food still intact			1
his biographer called it a ' time capsule ' immortalised : @entity40 ( left ) played the war hero in the 1962 blockbuster @entity1 evidence : the men returned to excavate and discovered spent cartridges and a broken @entity47 bottle but the camp would have gone unnoticed for many years more had it not been for a chance discovery in the @entity51			1
@entity52 , an archaeologist at @entity53 , found a loosely - sketched map from 1918 by a pilot who recalled the camp from memory after a reconnaisance flight			1
he scoured through images on @entity60 to find a part of the desert which matched the drawing in a 10 - year investigation called the @entity65			0
finally he found the small camp , which @entity1 said was ' behind the toothed hill facing tell @entity69 station ' , in november 2012 exactly where he predicted it would be			1
accompanied by project directors @entity73 and @entity74 , both based at @entity76 , he found ashes still in a camp fire and broken biscuit boxes strewn across the 100 - yard square			2
mr @entity74 told @entity81 : ' when you 're talking about the field of modern conflict archaeology , it 's the closest we can get to finding @entity87 's tomb			1
the relics included a steel hawser clamp for holding or gripping steel rope ( left ) and gin bottle fragments ( right ) haul : the archaeologists found a spark plug from one of the armoured @entity95 driven across the desert modern history : another relic from the camp , which @entity1 would go on to describe in his memoirs clues : the archaeologists tracked down the ashes from the soldiers ' brushwood campfire , pictured ' what was extraordinary was that we did n't expect to find anything on site			1
our assumption was that we 'd go there and find nothing but at least we knew where it was			0
' we were looking up at the landscape rather than down , then suddenly @entity52 said : " i think that looks like a broken rum jar "			0
' the whole site was meticulously excavated and recorded and we pieced together fragments of the rum jar into a whole			0
' it was incredibly exciting to be there and so very , very close to where @entity1 himself was			2
' in his book @entity128 he has this very vivid description of eating bully beans and biscuits and drinking tea with condensed milk , watching the sparks rising into the night from the brushwood fire			0
' we even found the ashes from that fire			0
' mr @entity52 said finding the camp took him four years from start to finish			0
the breakthrough came , he said , when he combined the sketch map with a photograph of soldiers standing with armoured @entity146 next to a distinctive hill			1
desert : the location of @entity1 's camp , which researchers found with @entity60 and an old map distinctive : mr @entity52 told @entity81 he recognised the hill by its unusual shape travelling in style : @entity16 forces had crossed the remote desert in an armoured @entity25 , pictured ' i immediately recognised what it could be and put the pieces together , ' he told @entity81			1
' i then used @entity60 to find a location precisely , and we logged the co-ordinates			0
' we punched the data into a gps receiver and marched across the desert , and there it was , exactly where we predicted			0
it 's easy when you know how '			0
he added : ' this camp had been used as a staging post for many for the epic raids on the @entity179 at @entity180 and @entity181			2
' scattered in the desert floor was the remains of their last meals of rusty tin cans from @entity187 and fragments of rum jars and gin bottles			1
' @entity1 's authorised biographer @entity191 told the @entity192 : ' it 's a time capsule			2
unlike on the western front , in the empty areas of the @entity196 it just stays there			0
' so you get a remarkable picture as if you have walked in the day after they left			0
' @entity1 stayed at the camp in 1917 and 1918 and was joined by @entity16 officers who were used to a higher standard of accommodation - having driven across the desert in armoured @entity146			1
the period in the desert would see some his most cunning attacks on @entity20 supply routes , which provided a crucial distraction to @entity212 troops and allowed an @entity214 revolt to be victorious			1
drama : @entity1 ( 1962 ) , starring @entity40 ( right ) as the officer who disrupted supply routes legendary : @entity1 barefoot in the desert during the campaign			2
he was just 46 when he died during the @entity21 the @entity20 , allied with @entity29 and facing the end of their old empire , were beset by an @entity214 revolt which @entity16 wanted the @entity214 to win			1
gifted operator @entity1 would become a crucial part of that plan			2
born in north @entity226 in 1888 , he learned @entity227 on an archaeological dig in @entity229			0
as he spent three years there in the run - up to the war he became sympathetic to the @entity214 people , who had lived under the rule of the @entity212 for centuries			2
when the war broke out in 1914 , @entity1 became an intelligence officer based in @entity238 and two years later the hostilities spread into an @entity214 revolt			2
the @entity16 colonel became the adviser to the son of the revolt 's leader , @entity244			2
renowned for his cunning tactics , @entity1 's small band of forces hit supply routes which distracted @entity20 troops from the fighting they were supposed to be doing			1
his efforts were vital in helping @entity244 's forces win a victory which enabled them to establish a unified state spanning large parts of the @entity259 peninsula			0
the story would later be immortalised by @entity40 in the epic 1962 film @entity1			0
after the war @entity261 appointed @entity1 as an adviser , but he quit the role as he hated the publicity it gave him			0
the war hero died aged 46 in a motorcycle accident just three months after he left the @entity13 .			0

@entity270 stumbled upon a sketch map of the camp by @entity13 pilot from 1918
archaeologists found gin bottles and spent cartridges still in @entity5 desert
@entity1 stayed in the camp to launch guerilla raids on @entity20 troops
@entity16 wanted @entity214 forces to beat the @entity20 , who were allied with @entity29
modern conflict archaeologist : it 's our *equivalent* of @entity87
