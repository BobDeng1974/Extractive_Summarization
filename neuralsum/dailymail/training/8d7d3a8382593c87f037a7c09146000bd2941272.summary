while this agreement is n't fully finalized , we are hoping we can wrap things up quickly			0
@entity10 , who founded the news site @entity3 before joining @entity12 , paid $ 1.3 million for the spacious 1890s house in @entity14 ' over the last few days we 've watched as comments and emotions flared on both sides of the issue			1
some folks arguing for homeowner rights , others for the preservation of old homes			0
we 've read all of this , along with your emails , and took it all to heart			0
' we decided on @entity14 not as an investment property , or vacation spot , but as a place we hope to one day call home , a place to raise our family			0
we love so much about your beautiful city , and your strong community bond is high up on that list			0
while we could have legally put our heads down and proceeded forward , that 's not the type of relationship we want with our neighbors and our new city friends			0
but when he revealed plans to demolish the five - bedroom house and build a new one on the site , neighbors started a petition to try to save the property updates : @entity10 and his wife had planned to remodel the five - bedroom house extra work : the couple then put in plans to demolish the family home because of concern over asbestos the house , which was built in 1892 , has been described as one of the ' great icons of @entity14 '			1
last week however , a permit was issued to tear the property down after @entity10 had it removed from an historic homes inventory			1
@entity112 , who was one of the agents who listed the property , said he knew @entity10 and his wife @entity10 planned a remodel , but said he was shocked to hear it was going to be pulled down			1
' we did expect him to do a substantial remodel , but you pay $ 1.3 million and tear a house down ? in @entity14 ? that does n't happen in , ' he told the @entity122			0
an online petition set up by the couple 's new neighbors attracted more than 1,100 signatures since being set live			1
in an open letter addressed to @entity10 and his wife , the petition states : ' when several of us met you at this year â€™s @entity132 , we were eager to find out about your plans			2
' we were reassured that you had no plans to build on the spare lot , and were relieved to hear that you were committed to remodeling rather than demolishing the house			0
' it added that the neighbors had been shocked to later hear that the property had been removed from @entity14 's landmark inventory and was set to be demolished			0
@entity10 then responded to the petition , releasing a statement that claimed the couple had been left no choice after receiving a quote for remodeling that was more than the house price			1
despite having surveys done before agreeing to buy the house , the couple later discovered extensive repairs were needed			0
@entity10 said that they asked the previous owner to buy back the house and fix the asbestos and other issues with it , and said if the demolition went ahead the materials would be recycled			2
unlisted : @entity2 had the house removed from a list of potentially significant properties ' we never intended to deceive anyone , as some of you have accused			0
we simply wanted to create a beautiful home for our family , ' @entity10 said			2
he added that the house had been listed as potentially significant on a voluntary register , but when an independent architect inspected it , they assured the couple it was not historically important			0
@entity10 said the couple had hoped to just carry out an extensive remodel but ' the costs were higher than we anticipated , and we knew we could never recoup that kind of money on a 100 year - old house '			1
@entity182 and @entity183 , who the @entity184 bought the house from , have also backed the petition to save the property , issuing a statement praising neighbors for raising concerns about the demolition			1
' the only solution acceptable to us is to save the house , not to remove it , ' the couple wrote .			2
