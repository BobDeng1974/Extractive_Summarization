by @entity0 high blood pressure is the @entity3 's biggest silent killer ; affecting 16million people in the @entity3 at least one in four people with high blood pressure have abandoned their medication or take too little to combat their higher risk of heart problems , warn researchers			1
a new study shows ‘ alarmingly high levels ’ of patients failing to take prescribed drugs , which may lead to them needing costly further treatment			1
high blood pressure is the @entity3 ’s biggest silent killer ; affecting 16million people in the @entity3 , with many taking drugs			1
it is estimated more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the @entity3 could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure			1
experts are calling for wider use of a simple test to determine whether patients are taking their pills , or if they are not working			0
a study team from the @entity30 of @entity31 and the @entity32 used the test to analyse urine samples from 208 patients with high blood pressure attending a specialist clinic			1
they had poor control of their condition or resistant hypertension , which meant they appeared not to be responding to drugs			0
of the group , 125 were new patients sent by their gp , 66 had poor blood pressure control and 17 had been referred for renal denervation , a kidney procedure to lower blood pressure when other methods have failed			2
the tests showed one - quarter of patients either did not take their tablets at all or only occasionally - with 10 per cent not taking any tablets and 15 per cent just some of the time			0
patients with poor blood pressure control were least likely to stick to their medicines regime , along with those referred for the kidney procedure			2
the less likely people were to take their medicines , the higher their blood pressure readings , says a report in the journal @entity67			2
the team said most patients with hypertension referred for extra hospital care ‘ would routinely undergo many additional tests and procedures ’ in a bid to find out why the drugs were n’t working			0
recent guidance from the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) suggested between a third and a half of medicines prescribed for long - term conditions are not used as recommended			0
professor @entity81 , of the @entity82 at the @entity83 , in an editorial , said patients failing to take blood pressure drugs was a particular problem because they usually had no symptoms			2
it is estimated that more than 120,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in the @entity3 could be avoided if people lowered their blood pressure ( file picture , posed by model ) he said it was a ‘ shock ’ that 23 per cent of those referred for the kidney procedure had no detectable drug in their system , potentially wasting @entity103 resources			1
analysing urine samples could ‘ solve at a stroke the problem of monitoring adherence and should rapidly transform practice ’ , he added			0
@entity109 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity110 , said ‘ although this is a small study , it highlights a big problem			0
‘ high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart and circulatory disease			1
‘ not taking prescribed meds means blood pressure levels are uncontrolled , which could increase the risk of heart attack or stroke			1
‘ if you ’re thinking about stopping your medication because you ’re experiencing side effects , make sure you talk to your gp			0
‘ they will talk things through with you and may suggest changes to your meds , which could help resolve the issue			0
’ a high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury ( @entity135 )			1
the first figure , the systolic pressure , corresponds to the ‘ surge ’ that occurs with each heart beat while the diastolic reading is the pressure in the ‘ resting ’ stage between beats			0
if readings are consistently at 140/90 or above , high blood pressure is diagnosed .			2

high blood pressure is @entity3 's biggest silent killer ; affecting 16million people
around 120,000 heart attacks could be avoided by lowering blood pressure
study shows ' alarmingly high level ' of patients fail to take prescribed drugs
not taking medication could increase risk of having heart attack or stroke
