a woman and her money are easily parted when it comes to anti-ageing beauty treatments			1
or , to be more accurate , this woman and her money are easily parted			2
i ’m intelligent and educated , but tell me that you can knock ten years off my face , no matter how daft the procedure , and i ’ll be rushing to the cashpoint quicker than @entity9			2
in the past i ’ve been lasered , @entity11 , scrubbed and had everything from snake venom to leeches or flakes of gold rubbed into my face without a moment ’s hesitation			2
@entity19 keeps till as an ice - cold exfoliating paste made of nightingale droppings is applied but , when it came to the prospect of my most recent procedure , i have to admit i did hesitate			1
it may be reassuringly expensive and loved by a-list celebrities , but the problem is that it just does n’t sound very nice			2
why ? because it involves having bird poo slathered all over my chops			2
sometimes it is referred to as the ‘ @entity35 facial ’ , other times it ’s known as the ‘ @entity36 ’ ( the species that provides the raw ingredient ) or ‘ @entity40 facial ’ , but no matter how it ’s dressed up it all boils down to one thing : having animal excrement smeared on your skin			1
the facial is said to have anti-ageing qualities as well as being highly effective in the treatment of acne scars			1
@entity50 is reported to be a huge fan as is @entity52 and even @entity54 ’s @entity53			1
the droppings in question do n’t come from any old nightingale — they are collected from a particular type , native to the @entity40 island of @entity60			1
so rare are the ingredients used that very few places offer the treatment and , when they do , it comes with a hefty price tag attached			1
today i ’m at the only salon offering it in the @entity67 — spa to you at the @entity70 on @entity71 , where clients pay £ 180 for a 90 - minute session			2
my therapist , @entity74 , tells me that nightingale poo was first used as a beauty treatment in @entity40 back in the 17th century when geisha girls and kabuki ( @entity40 dance - drama ) performers discovered it helped repair skin damage caused by the heavy lead - based make - up they wore			1
a gauze mask containing more nightingale guano goes on as the ingredients used are entirely natural ( albeit slightly gross ) it is suitable for every skin type including my own very sensitive one that ’s prone to flaring up with any product that ’s too heavily perfumed or chemical - packed			2
the nightingales are fed on a special diet of seeds and berries ( no juicy worms for them ) , therefore the droppings are organic and vegan			1
so that ’s ok then			2
first , @entity74 cleanses my face in preparation for exfoliation with my first dose of droppings			1
i ask to see the nightingale poop and am relieved			2
i had envisaged a lumpy , gloopy grey mess similar to the one pigeons leave on my windscreen			2
in fact , the droppings are powder - fine and a soft yellow colour			1
after collection , they are treated with uv light to sanitise and dehydrate them before being turned into a fine powder and shipped to salons			1
my mixture is a combination of the nightingale poo mixed in with a little rice bran			2
bird dropping paste mixed with water reduces eye bags while the nightingale ’s song may be sweet , its droppings most certainly are not			1
the exfoliator feels icy cold when applied to my face and smells like the inside of a hamster cage : musty , ripe and a little mouldy			0
@entity74 uses a steam machine to help the exfoliation process as it warms the skin , so the dead skin cells lift off more easily			0
after five minutes , the bird poop is wiped off my face			0
my face is then toned with rose water before being massaged in order to heat up the surface of my skin prior to the next stage — the application of a mask also containing nightingale guano ( that ’s excrement to you and me )			0
a barrier cream is applied to prevent the mask from sticking to the hairs on my face and a series of gauze swatches are laid over the top			0
@entity74 warns me that some clients find the mask procedure claustrophobic as it sets and tightens on the skin and the mouth is usually encased			0
this time , the droppings have been mixed with a little water to form a paste — which turns the yellowy powder blue — which is then painted on to my face and neck			1
second time around it does n’t smell so bad , although i ’m not sure if that ’s because i have grown accustomed to it or whether the water has diluted the pong			0
in addition to anti-ageing your skin , one of the other alleged benefits is that it helps to lighten pigmentation marks caused by sun damage and reduce the effects of unsightly eye bags			0
the nightingales are fed a special diet of seeds and berries so that droppings are organic and vegan this is because the droppings contain an enzyme called ‘ guanine ’ that ’s present in our own dna			1
the amino acid works as a natural bleaching agent , lightening dark circles and blemishes			0
@entity200 ( a waste product excreted in urine ) is also found in the droppings and , while it ’s another unappealing aspect of the treatment , it ’s been found to help lock moisture into the skin			1
@entity209 as it all sounds , if it works , it ’s just what i need as , in my teens before the dangers were fully known , i used sunbeds every weekend , resulting in lots of unsightly brown marks around my forehead and on my cheeks			0
the mask hardens after ten minutes , making me look like @entity219			0
after another ten minutes , it is lifted off in one piece			0
any remaining residue is then cleaned away with rose water while a layer of moisturiser is applied			0
immediately afterwards my skin feels and looks very soft and dewy but , in fairness , it feels that way after any pampering facial treatment			1
the question is , does it look and feel sufficiently good to justify the jaw - dropping price and the ignominy of the whole thing ? on balance , i think the answer is yes			0
i notice a definite improvement in my dark circles and the sun damage marks on my forehead			0
i also have bad scarring on my chest following an unfortunate incident with hot oil and a chip pan some years ago and the marks there are also significantly reduced			0
@entity74 advises me not to clean my face for at least 24 hours and explains that , for best results , the facial should be repeated monthly			0
little does she know that , to get my money ’s worth , it will be a lot longer than 24 hours before my cheeks see any soap or a flannel — and with that price tag it is unlikely i ’ll be returning every four weeks			0
two days later , i meet a friend for her birthday lunch and she tells me i look glowing before miming a needle going into my forehead to suggest i ’ve had @entity261			0
but i have n’t actually had any for more than a year			0
since i reckon @entity261 takes around five years off my face and that my friend thinks the nightingale droppings have done the same , that ’s a result i am more than pleased with			1
the mask is removed and moisturiser is then applied of course the bird poo facial is n’t that much cheaper than @entity261 but , as @entity74 explains , the reason the price is so high is that the ingredients are very hard to come by			0
‘ the droppings come from one farm in @entity40 and are very difficult to import			1
the birds are now protected and their droppings are no longer allowed to be @entity276 ’s only the existing supply that can be used and , once it ’s gone , that ’s it — the nightingale facial will no longer be available			1
’ she estimates they have about another year ’s supply left			0
it ’s been several days since my treatment and , although sceptical , i have to say my skin has taken on a translucent quality that seems to have lasted			1
what about my wrinkles ? it has n’t made any impact on the deeper lines , but the fine ones around my eyes and lips are n’t nearly so noticeable			0
at £ 180 a pop , the nightingale facial will not become part of my regular beauty regime but as a one - off treatment to brighten , lighten and rejuvenate the skin — all i can say is , do n’t poo - poo the idea .			1
