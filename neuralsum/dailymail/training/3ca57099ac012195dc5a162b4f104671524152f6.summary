by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 7 august 2013 a biologist from the @entity2 has discovered while that some sharks can be aggressive , others can be ' mellow '			1
he said that his evidence points to the existence of a ' personality ' in the much maligned fish			0
biologist @entity9 added that it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species			1
a study of young @entity15 , like the one pictured , found they have personalities and fish that were novelty - seekers , were less sociable than sharks that played it safe when exploring a new enclosure in a study of young @entity15 , he found that some of the fish were novelty - seekers while others were less sociable and played it safe when exploring a new enclosure			1
mr @entity9 , of the @entity32 in the @entity2 , conducted the first study of its kind into the behaviour of @entity15 , which are relatively easy to capture and handle , measuring less than a metre when they are young			1
the biologist caught and tagged sharks living around 60 miles east of @entity40 and studied them in pools			2
in a bid to determine if the sharks were sociable he watched them swim together for 20 minutes and documented their behaviour every 30 seconds			2
mr @entity9 told @entity47 that two sharks typically follow each other and are sociable			2
in another test that looked at solitary sharks in a new pen measuring 80 feet squared , they displayed distinctive personalities			0
he said : they are not machines , they have personality			0
' a @entity2 biologist believes some sharks ( a @entity61 is pictured ) can be ' mellow ' and it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species certain sharks were more inclined to explore and were described as novelty - seeking , while others were more sociable , according to repetitive tests designed to ensure consistency			1
the scientist presented the results of the study - which found novelty - seeking sharks tended to be less sociable then their peers and vice-versa - at the @entity76			1
he said : ' you ca nâ€™t generalise behaviour of one individual to a species			1
' despite the species ' reputation as a fearsome predator and an aggressive hunter , mr @entity9 says some sharks are ' pretty mellow ' compared to their peers			2
the biologist believes animals that usually live as part of a group take fewer risks than solitary creatures that are more prone to danger			0
his work sits neatly within a new field of science called behavioral syndromes that studies how creatures ' behaviour differs from one individual to another , but how their reaction is also consistent in a certain situation			0
mr @entity9 believes animals that usually live as part of a group like @entity103 ( pictured ) that hunt together , take fewer risks than solitary creatures that are more prone to danger scientists are interested in comparing research into animals ' personalities across different species to see how the quality has evolved			1
a mixture of personalities in a group could potentially have a huge bearing on the survival of certain species			0
however , the idea that animals have personalities is not new and perhaps originated in the 1920s when @entity122 famously described his observations of different responses in dogs			0
in the 1930s , an @entity127 psychologist created a way of grading the behaviour of young chimpanzees , but now studies are more mainstream and many scientists agree that animals can behave as individuals .			0

biologist from the @entity2 believes some sharks can be ' mellow '
@entity140 should not generalise behaviour of one animal to an entire species
@entity9 of the @entity32 studied @entity15 and found some were novelty seekers and less sociable that others
the research adds to an *increasing* amount of evidence that shows some *intelligent* animals can act as individuals with distinct personalities
