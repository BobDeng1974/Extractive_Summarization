by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:18 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 08:38 est , 20 february 2013 a millionaire businessman today won his fight to keep a large @entity5 slogan which he painted on the side of his house			1
@entity8 had been ordered to remove the words because they were a form of advertising comparable to a @entity13 's billboard			1
but he appealed the ruling , and successfully argued that the slogan was not disproportionately large or garish and did not damage the character of his neighbourhood			1
' breaches planning laws ' : millionaire businessman @entity8 has won a court battle over this @entity5 slogan on his house in @entity23 , @entity24 , after the council ordered it be removed because it is ' advertising ' the 54 - year - old painted an @entity29 message meaning , ' there is no god but @entity32 and @entity33 is his messenger , ' on the side of his semi-detached eight - bedroom home in @entity23 , south @entity24			1
the council later ruled that he required planning permission to display the slogan , saying that it fell under the same category as a commercial advertisement			2
today planning inspector @entity40 overturned that initial ruling , judging that the sign was not so obtrusive that it damaged the interests of other locals			1
mr @entity8 spoke of his joy at the decision , saying that it set a positive precedent for others who wished to express their faith publicly			1
' it ’s a good way forward so people can feel comfortable living in the @entity54 , ' he said			0
' if a neighbour wanted to put a @entity57 on their house i would n’t have any objection whatsoever			2
i would respect it fully			0
' ' @entity62 ' : the message , in 2ft - high lettering , is written across a first - floor archway on the detached house the message on the side of @entity8 's house comes from the @entity5 creed , known as shahada , which declares the belief in the oneness of @entity74 and acceptance of @entity33 as his prophet			1
in @entity78 , this translates as : ' there is no god but @entity74 , @entity33 is the messenger of @entity74 ' a single , honest recitation of the shahadah in @entity29 is all that is required for a person to become a @entity84			1
this declaration , or statement of faith , is called the kalimah			0
in some sects in @entity91 , the creed is expanded with the addition of a phrase concerning @entity8 at the end to say : ' and @entity8 is the wali ( friend ) of @entity74 '			1
taking this creed is one of the five pillars of @entity91			0
the complete shahadah can not be found in the @entity101 , but comes from hadiths , sayings or or tacit approvals ascribed either validly or invalidly to the @entity5 prophet @entity33			2
he added : ' it is not there as an advertisement , the sign was just to bless the house , that ’s the purpose			2
' the green colour means peace			0
this sort of thing is common in cities like @entity117 and @entity118			0
' mr @entity8 had the sign placed onto the side of his £ 750,000 home in @entity23			1
but the city 's council later decided he did n't have the right planning permission to display the message across the home 's stone archway			2
the sign , which is around two metres wide and 60cm high , includes the declaration of the @entity5 faith , called the @entity5 creed			2
business consultant mr @entity8 has also applied for permission to illuminate the sign in low voltage lighting			1
a family member , who did not wish to be named , added : ' it 's our home and we should be free to do whatever we want			0
' we 're suppose to have freedom of speech in this country and be allowed to express our faith however we please			0
' mr @entity8 applied for retrospective permission , but it was turned down			2
legal fight : council officers accused the slogan of being similar to an advert for the likes of @entity13 's @entity147 argued that the sign is an obtrusive ' advertisement ' according to planning regulations			1
under these guidelines , an advertisement includes any word , letter , model , sign , placard , board or notice used for advertising , making an announcement or direction			0
a council statement read : ' the property is domestic property and is not a mosque where such signs might be expected			0
' the sign consists of letters and words that announce religious faith and so can be considered to be an advertisement and express planning consent is required			0
' the advertisement is prominently sited upon the host building and is also prominent			0
its size and position on the building make it obtrusive			0

' there is no god but @entity32 , and @entity33 is his messenger , ' sign reads
planners *banned* slogan saying it was like a @entity13 's billboard
but @entity8 , 54 , wins right to keep sign after ruling is overturned
' i would n't mind if my neighbours painted a cross on their house , ' he says
