by @entity1 reporter published : 08:15 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 17 september 2012 @entity3 children eat as much salt as adults — about 1,000 milligrams too much , or the same amount as in just one @entity7 – with its effects in some cases tripling children ’s blood pressure rates			1
while extra salt is already linked with higher blood pressure , even in kids , government research says those who are overweight and obese may be the most vulnerable to its effects , according to the new findings from the @entity18			1
previous research has shown similar results in adults but studies on salt , weight and blood pressure are scarce in children , the research published in the journal @entity21 on monday revealed			2
consumption : the recommended daily salt or sodium intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily , or about 2,300 milligrams though on average , kids were found consuming 3,300 milligrams daily the @entity18 researchers looked at data on 6,200 kids aged 8 to 18 involved in 2003 - 08 national health surveys			1
the children were asked twice over several days to detail all foods they 'd eaten the previous day ; the researchers calculated salt intake from their answers			1
overall , 15 per cent had either high blood pressure or slightly elevated blood pressure called prehypertension			0
those who ate the most salt faced double the risk of having elevated blood pressure , compared with those who ate few salty foods showing that for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in the children 's diets , a one - point increase in blood pressure was found			1
among overweight or obese kids , the risk was more than triple , showing that for 1,000 mg of sodium consumed , there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points			2
the recommended daily salt or sodium intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily , or about 2,300 milligrams			1
on average , study kids ate 3,300 milligrams daily			1
according to previous data from the @entity18 , @entity3 adults consume 3,466 mg of sodium per day by comparison			1
too much : children were found eating about 1,000 milligrams too much of salt daily , equaling the same amount as in just one @entity7 ( pictured ) @entity18 researcher @entity73 says it 's unclear why heavier kids would be more sensitive to salt but it could be due to obesity - related hormone changes			1
the results raise concerns because studies have shown that elevated blood pressure in childhood , even just prehypertension , can lead to full - fledged high blood pressure in adulthood and potentially premature heart disease			0
' we should n't underestimate the potential harms of a 1 - mm increase in systolic blood pressure , ' said dr. @entity91 , chief of pediatric nephrology at @entity93 at @entity94 in @entity95 who was involved in the research			2
' the antecedents of adult cardiovascular disease are seen early on in the pediatric age group			0
' prehypertension and high blood pressure in children younger than 17 depend on age , height and gender			2
in those 18 and up , readings between 120 over 80 and 140 over 90 are prehypertension ; 140 over 90 and higher is high blood pressure			0
while health authorities across the globe warn consumers to cut back on dietary salt , a number of recent studies have suggested that not getting enough salt can be as harmful as getting too much			0
getting a rise : for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in children 's diets , a one - point increase in blood pressure was found while for overweight or obese children there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points the salt industry has pounced on that research , saying the dietary guidelines for sodium intake are flawed and should be withdrawn			1
dr. @entity131 of the @entity132 in @entity95 cautioned that it 's not clear that cutting back on sodium will do most kids any good			0
' there is nothing in this paper - and there is no information that i 'm familiar with - that suggests reducing sodium intake is of value for people eating an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day , ' he told @entity148			2
@entity131 said he has been an adviser to the @entity149 , which represents the industry , and received $ 750 from the group in 1995			0
he said he has no ties to the group today			0
@entity154 said bread is the biggest source of dietary sodium in the @entity3 , adding that deli meats also contain a lot of the ingredient			0
eating a healthy diet - including whole grains , vegetables , fruits , and fresh fish and meats - will automatically reduce sodium intake , she noted .			0

children were found consuming 1,000 milligrams too much according to study by the @entity18
the recommended daily salt intake for children and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon ( 2,3000 mg )
survey found kids consuming 3,300 mg daily or *160* mg less than adults
