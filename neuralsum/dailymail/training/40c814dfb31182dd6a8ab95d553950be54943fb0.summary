by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter former @entity5 player @entity4 has been granted permission to transfer to a jail closer to @entity8 for easier access to his lawyers , a judge ruled monday			1
the accused triple murderer was allowed the move to provide him with easier access to his lawyers as he awaits multiple murder trials			1
@entity4 smiled while in court for the hearing , which addressed mostly procedural issues , and also mouthed messages to his family as he arrived			1
@entity4 is also charged in @entity8 in the 2012 killings of two men			1
he has pleaded not guilty in both cases			0
prosecutors did not object to moving @entity4 from the @entity39 in @entity40 , which is about an hour and 20 minutes ' drive south of @entity8 , but they shot down defense lawyers ' claims that the former tight end 's privacy and due process rights were violated by the jail administrator			1
judge @entity48 ordered the move without addressing his privacy concerns			2
it is not clear when @entity4 will be moved or where he will be going			2
@entity48 did not specify a jail when she approved the request , other than saying it should be closer to @entity8 , such as in @entity56			2
@entity4 would be moved back to @entity57 if the @entity34 case goes to trial , she added			2
@entity48 also said she was concerned that a tentative trial date of oct. 6 was not realistic given the amount of evidence and additional motions she anticipates will be filed			0
one of @entity4 's lawyers , @entity65 , told her he anticipated that it was possible they would file for a change of venue			1
' we 're not prepared to do that now , ' he said			0
' that may well be coming			0
' when asked outside court for his thoughts on a possible venue change , district attorney @entity73 would say only that it would be debated , and it did not sound as if that was something the judge was considering			0
@entity48 asked both sides to get back to her with their thoughts on whether oct. 6 is a realistic trial date			0
she set the next hearing for aug. 11 .			0

@entity4 is currently being held in @entity86 , almost one and a half hours from @entity8
