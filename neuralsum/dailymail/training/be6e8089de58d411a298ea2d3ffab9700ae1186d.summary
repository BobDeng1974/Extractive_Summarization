by @entity0 it has been suggested that the @entity2 , complete with its powerful armies , ambitious architectural feats and impressive reach , came to an end because of lead poisoning			1
but now an international team of scientists studying the lead content of ancient tap water has largely disproved the theory			2
the team found that @entity15 tap water contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs nearby , but the lead content was probably not enough to put ancient citizens at risk			2
like a game of @entity23 : scientists and archaeologists are not convinced that lead piping used to transport water to wealthy @entity15 ' villas ( pictured ) is to blame for @entity28 but say it contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs lead poisoning is caused by increased levels of lead in the body , which is toxic to many organs and tissues , including the heart , bones and kidneys			1
symptoms include abdominal pain , confusion , headaches , irritability and can result in seizures , coma and death			0
some historians claim that as lead levels in water drank by powerful and wealthy @entity15 were high , leaders were incapacitated or killed off , which helped lead to the decline of the @entity2			1
however , this latest study largely disproves their theory			0
there is ongoing debate as to what happened to the @entity2 in the 4th and 5th centuries but many include the disintegration of political , military , economic and social institutions combined with invasions at the peripheries of the sprawling empire			0
@entity66 , a geochemist , argued in a 1983 book that ' lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the @entity2			2
' his work centred on the fact that the @entity15 had few sweeteners besides honey and often made a syrup called defrutum or sapa in lead pots to sweeten wine and food , leading to the creation of lead acetate - as well as drinking water carried in lead pipes and bathing in it in municipal baths			1
he calculated the level of lead that wealthy @entity15 consumed and linked the findings to levels of the metal found in preserved bones			0
however , his work proved controversial and has been criticised by leading historians			0
wealthy and powerful @entity15 drank water from lead cups and jugs , carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes , which some historians argue weakened the @entity15 elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire which they ruled			1
the study says : ‘ it is now universally accepted that utilisation of lead for domestic purposes and water distribution presents a major health hazard			0
the ancient @entity15 world was unaware of these risks			0
‘ how far the gigantic network of lead pipes used in ancient @entity117 compromised public health in the city is unknown			2
’ in a bid to find out , the scientists and archaeologists from the @entity123 research centre in @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 in @entity127 and the @entity128 , took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at @entity133 , which was an industrious port in imperial @entity117 , as well as from a channel of the @entity135			1
they compared the lead isotopes in the samples with those extracted from @entity15 lead pipes to make a historical record of water in @entity117			1
the team discovered that @entity15 water probably contained around 100 times as much lead as spring water			0
however , while the levels are high , the experts said that the lead content in water was unlikely to be high enough to be harmful to humans and all but ruled out the role of lead poisoning as a reason for the demise of the powerful empire , @entity146 reported			1
wealthy and powerful @entity15 drank water from lead cups and jugs , carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes , some of which lined aqueducts ( like this one on major @entity164 , the @entity165 ) which some historians argue weakened the @entity15 elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire the experts said that the lead content in water was unlikely to be high enough to be harmful elite @entity15 , pictured in this marble relief pipes were only one source of lead contamination at the time as lead was used to make cooking pots , to store food and some wine , as well as for jewellery and make - up , which could cause some historians to argue that their theory of lead weakening the @entity15 elite still has credence			1
the argument that the @entity15 civilisation collapsed as a result of poisoning was first made around 30 years ago by geochemist @entity66 and has even been used by a handful of scientists to try and persuade governments to ban lead from gasoline			0
‘ although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of @entity117 ’s demise , its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes ( fistulæ ) still stands as a major public health issue , ’ the scientists wrote			2
in their study , published in journal @entity206 , the experts charted lead content at major events in @entity117 ’s history , such as the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity214 repairs to @entity15 aqueducts and the ninth century @entity217 sack of @entity117			2
‘ @entity221 [ lead ] isotope record shows that the discontinuities in the pollution of the @entity135 by lead are intimately entwined with the major issues affecting @entity117 and its water distribution system , ’ it says			0
the scientists think their research will help historians who are tracking the changing character of @entity232 ’s capital			0
scientists and archaeologists took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at @entity133 , which was an industrious port in imperial @entity117 , as well as from a channel of the @entity135 ( pictured near the @entity239 ) to analyse lead content			1

some historians have argued that lead poisoning killed off many elite @entity15 that drank water carried to their homes by a network of lead pipes
scientists took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at @entity133 , which was an port in imperial @entity117 and from a channel of the @entity135
they analysed the lead content and said that while levels were high , they were unlikely to have contributed to the fall of the @entity2
