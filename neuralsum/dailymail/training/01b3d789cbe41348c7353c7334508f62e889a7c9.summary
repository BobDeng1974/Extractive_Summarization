an independent @entity0 will not be able to compete in the @entity1 in @entity2 , a senior games official has warned			1
@entity5 vice president sir @entity4 said @entity0 athletes were highly unlikely to be able to represent their new country at the next games if the country votes for independence next week			1
sir @entity4 , who is also president of the @entity12 , said there would not be enough time between @entity0 independence in march 2016 and the start of the @entity16 that summer to allow @entity0 into the event			1
the revelation comes amid mounting concern in @entity20 over a surge in support for independence			0
a poll for @entity25 put the ‘ yes ’ camp ahead on 51 per cent to the no camp 's 49 per cent			0
panicking @entity20 politicians have drawn up a last - minute plan to save the union – promising @entity0 sweeping new powers on tax and welfare			2
the prospect of missing out on the world ’s biggest sporting event will offer the ‘ no ’ to independence camp further ammunition against separation			0
for @entity0 to be allowed to compete , the country ’s new sporting body will have to show that it is ‘ an independent nation recognised by the international community ’			1
but because of the short time frame between independence and the opening of the @entity16 , sir @entity4 told the @entity48 he thought it would be ‘ very , very difficult ’ for a newly independent @entity0 team to take part			1
he said : ‘ i have no idea how long that process of recognition will take			0
in practical terms the @entity5 has tended to use recognition by the @entity57			2
‘ many of the sports will have qualifying competitions that have all but finished			0
i do n't know if it could be done in time			2
i suspect it would be very , very difficult			0
’ a working group on @entity0 sport , set up by the @entity64 and chaired by former first minister @entity65 , concluded in may that a @entity0 team at the @entity16 was feasible			1
’ he said he believed some athletes may choose to continue representing @entity70 regardless of the outcome of the vote			0
the @entity73 , chaired by @entity74 , said it had not formed a view on what it would do if @entity0 voted for independence .			2

@entity79 will not be able to compete in the 2016 *olympics* in @entity16
@entity5 vice president @entity4 says @entity0 athletes unlikely to compete
there is n't enough time between independence and the start of the @entity16
