human evolution and @entity122 body modification artist @entity119 is largely credited with popularising sub-dermal implants			0
while @entity119 only uses silicone implants , @entity124 ( @entity124 ) and biocompatible materials are used for similar effect			0

however , users face several health risks , including infection , tissue resorption , nerve and muscle pressure , migration , and implant rejection , among others			0
immediately after the horns are implanted into the head , it will feel swollen and sore			1
about a week later the person may experience some black eyes and puffy eyelids			0
