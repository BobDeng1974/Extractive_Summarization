given that the @entity158 's national debt is £ 1.4trillion , the size of the cut in global gdp is truly colossal and would create suffering on a scale never before seen			0
a @entity2 euro exit alone would be manageable , but must be avoided to forestall a domino effect , said economic research group @entity162 in a study commissioned by the @entity164			0
the researchers did n't just calculate the losses of creditors who had lent money to the crisis - hit nations , they included the likely impact of a euro collapse on economic growth in the 42 most important industrial and emerging economies constituting 90 per cent of the global economy			0
' in their overall assessment , the authors of the study come to the conclusion that an isolated exit of @entity2 and an insolvency of this @entity182 country might well be something that the @entity15 could cope with from a merely economic point of view , ' the @entity164 said			1
' at the same time , however , it is extremely difficult to assess if and to what extent this might trigger a wave of further euro - zone exits in @entity7 's south			1
' if so , the implications for the global economy could be devastating			0
' the country is clinging to solvency with the help of two massive international bailouts worth a total 240billion euros			0
to secure them , it committed to drastic spending cuts , tax hikes and reforms , aimed to cure years of profligate government spending			0
but while significantly reducing budget deficits , the measures accelerated a recession that after five years is closer to a depression			2
the protests in @entity2 come as @entity147 chancellor @entity207 called for stronger central powers to intervene when @entity15 member states break budget rules			1
speaking ahead of a summit at @entity10 , she rebuffed demands for the quick creation of a pan-european bank supervisor			1
in a speech to the lower house of parliament , mrs @entity207 put herself on a collision course with @entity221 @entity220 president @entity219 and others , who are reluctant to cede sovereignty over fiscal policy and want the @entity225 ( @entity225 ) to get new watchdog powers by the end of the year			1
voicing support finance minister @entity229 's idea of a @entity7 ' currency commissioner ' , she said : ' we are of the opinion - and i speak for the whole @entity147 government on this - that we could go a step further by giving @entity7 real rights of intervention in national budgets			1
' on banking supervision , she said quality must come before speed , reiterating her view that rushing to meet a january 2013 target date for giving the @entity225 new powers was a recipe for disaster			2
mrs @entity207 also made clear that funnelling aid directly to @entity7 banks from the bloc 's new rescue mechanism , the @entity253 , could not happen until the new supervisory body was fully operational			1
the urgency of the situation is clear - by the end of next year , the @entity2 economy is expected to have shrunk by about a quarter from 2008 levels			0
and with one in four workers out of a job , @entity2 has the worst unemployment rate in the 27 - nation @entity15			1
difficult times : @entity2 is clinging to solvency with the help of two massive international bailouts worth a total 240billion euros more peaceful : members of trade union congresses of the private and public sector demonstrate against the new austerity package not a fan : a protestor holds a poster depicting @entity207 as no better than @entity275 mrs @entity207 today called for stronger central powers to intervene when @entity15 member states break budget rules @entity280 's economic growth tumbled to the lowest in more than three years in the latest quarter , but retail sales and investment improved in a possible sign a painful slump might be stabilising			1
the world 's second - largest economy grew 7.4 per cent in the three months ending in september , data showed today			0
that was down from the previous quarter 's 7.6 per cent and the lowest since the first quarter of 2009			0
retail sales rose 14.4 per cent , a small acceleration over the first half of the year , and investment in industrial assets and some other indicators also showed small improvements			0
@entity299 , spokesman for the @entity300 , said : ' judging from the third quarter figures , we can see a clear sign of steady economic growth			0
' there is a smaller margin of decline and some major indicators have been growing faster			0
' analysts expect @entity280 's economic growth to rebound late this year or early next year but say a recovery is likely to be too weak to drive global growth without improvement in the @entity312 and @entity7			1
' in general , we 're going from bad to worse , ' said 85 - year - old pensioner @entity313			0
' salaries are being reduced , pensions are being reduced , everything is getting more expensive , from food to health care to hospitals , medicines , everything			0
so how will people live ? how will we live ? ' the country 's four - month - old coalition government is negotiating a new austerity package with debt inspectors from the @entity15 , @entity327 ( @entity327 ) and @entity225 ( @entity225 )			1
the idea is to save 11billion euros in spending - largely on pensions and health care - and raise an extra 2.5billion euros through taxes			0
after more than a month - and - a - half of arguing , a deal seems close			0
on wednesday , the @entity15 , @entity327 and @entity225 troika said there was agreement on ' most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform ' and that the rest of the issues should be resolved in coming days			1
@entity22 hopes to get the next loan installment around mid-november , shortly after which it will run out of cash			0
that would probably force @entity2 to default on its mountain of debt and potentially abandon the 17 - strong eurozone			0
unions say the cost of securing the money is too high			0
@entity351 , secretary - general of the @entity353 civil servant union , said : ' what people can shoulder new measures , when approximately 70 per cent of it is caught between poverty and destitution ? it is absolutely impossible			0
' on the noteworthy day of the summit in @entity10 , we want to tell the leaders of the @entity15 " that 's enough			1
we ca n't take any more			0
" ' this is not worthy of @entity7			1
it is a policy of exploitation , of profiteers and loan sharks			0
