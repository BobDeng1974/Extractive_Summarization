president @entity0 said in an interview on tuesday that he ahs had to tell families of dead @entity4 hostages like 26 - year - old @entity5 that the @entity4 will not pay to ransom their loved one , and it 's ' as tough as anything i do			1
' but the @entity0 administration 's handling of the @entity12 saga – attempting , according to a member of @entity14 , to pay an intermediary for his safe return and then trading five high - value @entity18 terrorists for him when that failed – suggests the @entity21 's policy is less than consistent			1
@entity0 told @entity22 that ' as a general rule , what we do n’t want to do is make other @entity4 citizens riper targets ' for groups like the @entity30 terror army by handing over millions of dollars for hostages			1
' we devoted enormous resources , and always devote enormous resources , to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world , ' @entity0 said , ' and i deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only [ @entity5 ] , but the other individuals that had been held and probably missed them by a day or two			1
' president @entity0 told @entity22 in his latest unconventional media interview that @entity4 still wo n't pay to ransom hostages , but his handling of the @entity12 saga raises questions about how the situation of @entity5 's capture was handled @entity5 , 26 , an @entity4 humanitarian worker from @entity49 , @entity50 , died – according to @entity30 – when a @entity52 airstrike leveled a buildign in @entity54 @entity56 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) , the aunts of @entity5 , grieved on tuesday after the 26 - year - old 's death was confirmed – although the circumstances in which she perished remain unclear @entity0 launched a similar rescue mission to go after @entity12 , a @entity62 soldier who walked away from his post in 2009			1
but unlike in the @entity5 case , the administration also tried to make what a @entity67 congressman characterized as a random delivery to free @entity12 , who will likely be charged with desertion when the results of a @entity73 investigation are made public			1
rep. @entity74 said in november that the @entity73 attempted to pay the terrorist @entity75 in @entity76 , which was holding @entity12 , but was duped by a con man who ran off with the money			1
the @entity73 said on june 9 , 2014 that ' there was no money exchanged for @entity12 ’s release			2
' the @entity21 's @entity82 insisted a day later that ' the @entity4 did not provide money in exchange for sgt. @entity12 ’s release			1
' those carefully parsed statements , however , allow for the possibility that @entity74 is right : money was sent but never reached its intended recipient			0
@entity74 press secretary @entity88 told @entity89 in november that the @entity75 ' wanted to deal			2
they were desperate to deal			0
' the administration ' can deny it all they want , ' he said			0
he added that the federal government has long included ransom plans among possible outcomes during hostage crises , using third - party ' cutouts ' to maintain deniability			0
' we do n't pay a ransom in the sense that the @entity4 government officially makes payments to a foreign entity , ' @entity88 said , emphasizing the word ' officially			2
' ' the way we 've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround			0
' @entity67 @entity112 rep. @entity74 told the defense secretary in november that he had learned of an attempt to ransom @entity12 through a middle - man @entity12 ( right ) was captured by @entity18 fighters shortly after he abandoned his post in 2009 the @entity0 administration secured @entity12 's safe return by releasing five @entity18 leaders from the @entity122 , @entity118 military detention camp @entity74 wrote in a november 5 , 2014 letter to then - defense secretary @entity125 ' that a payment was made to an @entity128 intermediary who " disappeared " with the money and failed to facilitate @entity12 's release in return			1
the payment was made in january - february 2014			2
' ' i recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom , ' the congressman added , whiel claiming that the botched payment was indeed made ' regardless of how the transaction is described			2
' @entity0 's sit - down with @entity22 is the latest in a series of occasions where the @entity21 has given liberals in nontraditional media outlets rare access to the leader of the free world			0
last month three @entity150 celebrities interviewed @entity0 , including one comedienne best known for eating @entity152 while sitting in a bathtub filled with milk and the cereal			0
the folllowing day the president spoke with @entity157 , a newish left - wing website known for ' @entity160 ' news concepts – and attracting digital slaps from people eager to correct its mistakes			0
@entity22 's interview covered other topics related to @entity167 , the 2016 elections , and companies ' reactions to restrictions placed on them by the @entity172			0
@entity173 : @entity174 , bottom , and her mother , @entity176 , placed flowers at a makeshift memorial for @entity5 on tuesday in @entity49 , @entity50 @entity30 claimed the rubble of this house was where @entity5 died following a @entity52 airstrike , but that has not been confirmed the president also tried to square his vaccilating postions on gay marriage through the years , claiming that he always supported the idea although his opinion clashed during the 2008 elections ' with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there			2
' in the aftermath of the @entity5 murder at @entity30 's hands , @entity0 cautioned that paying ransoms would mean ' not only are we financing their slaughter of innocent people and strengthening their organization , but we ’re actually making @entity4 even greater targets for future kidnappings			1
' after the 5 - for - 1 @entity12 swap , a @entity18 commander in @entity128 told @entity207 that @entity4 can expect to see more kidnappings as terrorists seek to free more of their leaders from @entity4 custody			1
' it 's better to kidnap one person like @entity12 than kidnapping hundreds of useless people , ' the commander said			0
' it has encouraged our people			0
now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird			0

the president said tuesday that the @entity4 continues to refuse to pay ransom for hostages held *overseas*
that position may have *doomed* @entity5 , a 26 - year - old aid worker killed in the custody of the @entity30 terror army
but a member of @entity14 insisted in november that the @entity4 tried to random @entity62 sgt. @entity12 by paying a middle - man – who then *allegedly* ran off with the money
@entity0 *ultimately* made an in - kind payment to the @entity75 in the form of five high - value @entity18 terrorists who were held at @entity122
