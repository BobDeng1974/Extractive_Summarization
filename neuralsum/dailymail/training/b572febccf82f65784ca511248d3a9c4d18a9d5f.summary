a new novel about a predatory female teacher who preys on young boys has been banned in some book shops and branded ' disgusting ' by those shocked by its graphic sexual content			1
@entity9 , by @entity8 author @entity7 , tells the story of the ' insatiable ' eight - grade teacher @entity11 , 26			1
she has a ' husband who is devoted to her ' but has a ' singular sexual obsession - 14 - year - old boys '			2
in fact , she only chose the teaching profession so she could get close to school boys and the novel unfolds with sexual scenes of her seducing her pupils and caring ' nothing for anyone or anything but her own pleasure '			1
causing controversy : author @entity7 has written a book that has been banned in some shops and she wo n't let her parents read it @entity31 have described the book as a ' twisted tale ' and ' the sickest , most controversial book of the summer ' and it has been banned in some @entity36 book stores			1
@entity7 , a new mother , has forbidden her own @entity38 parents from reading it and has admitted some of the abuse she has received from outraged readers has been ' difficult '			2
but she told @entity43 the whole point of the book is to shock and offer a ' social satire ' on the way male victims of predatory teachers are treated by society in comparison to females			1
she said : ' when these cases occur there is all this " nudge , nudge , wink , wink , what a lucky boy			0
" gender differences : @entity7 said the cases of teachers @entity61 , left , and @entity62 , who both had relationships with their students , were handled differently by society ' it 's one thing for an adult male to think , ' gee , she looks great , i 'd like to have sex with her ' - assuming the boy is able to consent as we are , which i think is untrue			1
when the victim is female we do n't do any of that			0
' she points out that when the victim is a male , the tendency is for people to think he wanted the attention from the teacher because he 's an adolescent with raging hormones			1
whereas female victims are always seen to be ' taken advantage of '			2
' we eroticise the ( female ) teacher			2
i 'd like to guide the reader into understanding how uncomfortable and upsetting that tendency is ' this has been shown in the @entity91 press recently with the case of married teacher , @entity62 , who was jailed for running away with a 15 - year - old pupil			2
there has been numerous cases of female teachers seducing school boys but these do not get the same coverage or condemnation according to @entity7			1
she said : ' i wanted to satirise the ways that these cases are received in society			0
always looking to excuse the woman rather than looks at it as a criminal case , the way we do with men			0
' explicit : @entity9 is about a female teacher obsessed with having sex with teen boys she said through the sexual content in her book and the extreme character of @entity11 - who wo n't even have children because she 's scared she 'd want to have sex with her son when he 's a teen - she wants to change people 's way of thinking when the seducer of a pupil is a woman and not a man			1
she explained : ' portions of the book will shock and should shock			0
that 's what 's missing from these cases			0
' we eroticise the ( female ) teacher , fetishise them , use them for our own arousal			0
i 'd like to guide the reader into understanding how uncomfortable and upsetting that tendency is			0
' @entity7 's inspiration came from the media attention surrounding the case of @entity61 , a teacher in @entity142 who pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14 - year - old boy			1
@entity7 had gone to school with @entity146 and was alarmed at how in the press coverage , more focus was made on the fact she was an attractive blonde ( often pictured in a bikini ) than on her crimes			2
implying the school boy had ' got lucky ' rather than been abused			0
she said : ' with a boy , the reaction is so extreme as to have people say no crime was committed - ' what a wonderful learning experience , it will make him more popular '			0
' if the table were turned , those comments would be so obviously appalling			0
