@entity0 has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the @entity3 needs a global strategy to tackle it @entity0 has warned that terrorism motivated by religious extremism is growing and the @entity3 needs a global strategy to tackle it			1
the former prime minister said the battles of the 21st century will no longer be about extreme political ideology like the last			1
alongside security measures , including military action , the @entity3 must tackle conflicts by educating people about religious tolerance , he added			1
' the fact is that , though of course there are individual grievances or reasons for the violence in each country , there is one thing self - evidently in common : the acts of terrorism are perpetrated by people motivated by an abuse of religion			2
' it is a perversion of faith			2
but there is no doubt that those who commit the violence often do so by reference to their faith and the sectarian nature of the conflict is a sectarianism based on religion			2
' there is no doubt either that this phenomenon is growing , not abating			0
' he said recent terror attacks and violence , including those in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 as well as @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 , can not be viewed as separate acts of killing but need a global strategy			0
the challenge could ' define the nature of peace and conflict '			0
' the battles of this century are less likely to be the product of extreme political ideology - like those of the 20th century - but they could easily be fought around the questions of cultural or religious difference , ' he added			1
' the answer is to promote views that are open - minded and tolerant towards those who are different , and to fight the formal , informal and internet propagation of close - minded intolerance			0
in the 21st century , education is a security issue			1
' he announced the creation of a new online forum and database run by his @entity77 in collaboration with the @entity80 , which he hopes will become the world 's leading source of information and debate about religion and conflict			0
@entity89 victims of the @entity90 are planning to sue @entity0 for allegedly conniving with @entity91 to block compensation over @entity93 used in attacks which had been supplied by @entity49			2
mr @entity0 has been accused of helping to broker an agreement between the former @entity49 leader and president @entity97 which resulted in @entity49 paying Â£ 1billion in compensation to @entity101 victims of terrorism but ended compensation hopes of the @entity89 victims of @entity90 attacks			1
@entity106 of @entity107 is representing around 200 @entity89 victims of @entity90 attacks carried out with @entity93 supplied by @entity49			0
prime minister @entity0 ( left ) embraces @entity91 ( right ) after a meeting on may 29 , 2007 in @entity111 , @entity49 he told the @entity112 : ' it 's bad enough being a victim of @entity93 bombs supplied by @entity49 for the @entity90 campaign			1
' [ but ] it 's sheer horror then to be informed that the @entity89 government and @entity0 may have connived with @entity91 to ensure the few brave @entity89 victims that justly sued and stood up to the dictator received no compensation from the @entity49 , ' he said			2
but a spokeswoman for mr @entity0 said : ' the story is absurd and wrong			1
mr @entity0 was not involved in the issue of compensation at all			1
' he has never had anything to do with it and he has never discussed any such terms			0
' the letter they cite is not evidence of involvement on this issue all it reflects is government policy of the time which was to reengage with the @entity49 after they gave up their @entity138 programme and chose to cooperate rather than sponsor terrorism			0
' a @entity141 spokesman added : ' the government believes compensation claims are best pursued directly with the @entity49 government through private campaigns			0
' the claim that @entity142 officials took any deliberate action that denied other @entity89 victims compensation in the 2008 settlement is wrong			0
