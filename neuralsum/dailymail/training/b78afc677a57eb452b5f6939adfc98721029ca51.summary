by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 20:07 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 11 june 2013 soaring petrol prices , motoring taxes and a ‘ plague ’ of year - round potholes mean @entity9 ’s ‘ battle - scarred ’ drivers are at their most miserable for 25 years – many of them women , a new @entity3 report reveals today			1
a boom in aggressive driving and bad manners , widespread mobile - phone abuse – not forgetting speed cameras which did n’t exist in the ‘ golden age ’ of 1989 when even mobiles were in their infancy and weighed a ton - has left motorists fuming – though more reliant than ever on their wheels			1
price : the report charts the rise in fuel prices over 25 years			1
costs have soared by 264 per cent @entity27 : nine out of ten drivers say they are more reliant on their cars now than they were 25 years ago significantly , a much greater number of drivers – 16.7 million in total - are now women as the proportion of female licence - holders has swelled over the two and a half decades from 40 per cent to nearly half ( 46 per cent )			1
but so bad is motorists ’ morale over rising costs that a third ( 31 per cent ) say they would even accept @entity40 plans for controversial road tolls if road tax and fuel duty were both cut in return – though this is down on nearly four out of ten ( 38 per cent ) last year			1
some 42 per cent disagree with tolls and 27 per cent undecided ( compared to 43 per cent who disagreed last year with 19 per cent undecided )			2
the snap - shot of attitudes – and how they compare with a quarter of a century ago – is revealed in the 25th @entity51 for 2012			0
some 61 per cent of drivers cited rising costs as their biggest gripe over quarter of a century : ‘ the biggest perceived change in the last 25 years is the increased cost of motoring ’			1
but nine out of ten drivers ( 89 per cent ) admit to being more reliant on their cars than 25 years ago with almost as many ( 78 per cent ) saying they ’d find it difficult to have a ‘ car - free ’ lifestyle			1
just 17 per cent of drivers think motoring taxes ‘ fair ’ , it notes : ’ nearly half of motorists ( 49 per cent ) are unhappy with the balance and there is significant support for shifting the weighting from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty towards paying to drive on motorways an in city centres			1
’ ‘ almost a third of drivers ( 31 per cent ) would support the introduction of more toll roads in return for a reduction in current motoring taxes. , though this percentage has dropped from 38 per cent last year			1
’ ' some 29per cent were prepared to pay tolls for motorway driving , while 33 per cent backed city - centre congestion charges as long as the cost of fuel and car tax was ‘ significantly ’ reduced			1
angry : a combination of greater expense and poor driving etiquette is what frustrates drivers most back in 1989 – when @entity101 was prime minister , @entity100 president @entity99 left the @entity102 in january , and the fall of the @entity104 in november marked the end of the @entity106 , unleaded petrol was around a third of the price today at 38.5p a litre ( £ 1.75 a gallon ) compared to 134.2p a litre ( £ 6.10 per gallon ) today			2
@entity112 has also soared nearly three-fold from 36.1p a litre ( £ 1.64 a gallon ) to 138.9p a litre ( £ 6.31 a gallon )			0
fuel duty has also increased from 17.7p a litre for petrol and 17.3p a litre for diesel to a standard rate of 57.95p a litre			0
and that ’s before the vat tax is added at 15 per cent in 1989 but 20 per cent today			2
there were 10 million fewer cars on the road ( 24.2 million compared to 34.5 million today )			2
top five sellers in 1989 were the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
the top five sellers the year - to the end of may 2013 are the @entity132 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity134 and the @entity139			0
there were seven million fewer drivers			0
but much of the increase since then is down to women			0
of the 27.8million drivers on the road in 1989 , 11.1 million ( 40 per cent ) were women , the remaining 16.7million ( 60 per cent ) were men			1
today , of the 35.2million drivers , 16.3million ( 46.3 per cent ) are women , compared to 18.9million ( 53.7 per cent ) who are men			2
and it would be around three years before the first speed cameras arrived			0
the @entity3 report notes : ’ one of the biggest changes to motoring in the past quarter of a century has been the huge increase in fuel prices – a whopping increase of 264 per cent in just two and a half decades			2
’ and on tax it adds : ’ today the total cost of fuel duty has soared by over 240 per cent			0
’ in 1989 vehicle excise duty on a family car was £ 100			0
today under the ‘ polluter pays ’ policy it ’s on a sliding scale based on @entity170 emissions from zero tax for ultra clean cars up to more than £ 1,000 for gas - guzzlers , with mid-range cars facing around £ 475 a year			0
on lack of courtesy , two thirds ( 65 per cent ) of drivers think road rage has got worse with almost as many ( 62 per cent ) bemoaning a growing lake of courtesy , with more than a quarter ( 28 per cent ) saying driving is ‘ more aggressive ’ than 25 years ago			1
more than 1 in 5 ( 22 per cent are frustrated by growing jams and congestion on motorways and in towns and cities with almost as many ( 20 per cent ) saying it ’s harder to find a parking spot			0
and three quarters ( 76 per cent ) point to illegal hand - held mobile phone by other drivers use as a growing source of stress			1
unhappy : road rage has increased in the past 25 years the report notes : ‘ those who were driving in 1989 look back on this as a golden age of motoring and feel that driving in @entity9 in 2013 is less enjoyable			1
‘ currently the harsh reality for many motorists is one where journeys to work or just to the shops are fraught with traffic jams , road works , potholes and fuel prices over £ 1.39 a litre			0
’ @entity3 technical director @entity212 said @entity9 's motorists and roads have been left ‘ battle - scarred ’ bearing an unfair burden : ‘ the report suggests that motorists would prefer to see a higher share of motoring taxation levied on those things over which they have greater control - such as whether or not they choose to drive into city centres or use a particular motorway			1
’ the cost of driving was the biggest concern for 49per cent of motorists , with 41per cent saying maintenance of local roads and motorways is their top spending priority			2
some 84per cent of the 1,542 drivers polled believed their local roads were deteriorating			2
on the positive side today ’s cars are safer , less - polluting , and far more fuel efficient than 25 years ago			1
this is the 25th published @entity51 on @entity241			0
the first was published in 1989 , using data collated at the end of 1988 and early 1989			0
@entity3 is calling it the ‘ @entity246 ’ edition .			0

61 per cent of drivers said rising costs have been the most noticeable *negative* change in the last 25 years
