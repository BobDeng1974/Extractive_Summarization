by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 04:14 est , 5 october 2012 what do you get if you mix @entity6 's world famous @entity4 check with @entity9 conceptual artist @entity8 's distinctive stripes ? the answer : a 1960s extravaganza showcased in a dramatic , geometric setting			2
@entity6 's @entity14 show , helmed by @entity6 's creative director @entity15 and with the space curated by @entity17 , opened in typically spectacular style with models in bold checks rendered in acid brights , pale grey or stark black and white , streaming down escalators into the @entity24			1
@entity17 , known for his minimalism , rose boldly to the occasion , creating a shopping precinct with four full - scale escalators , each decorated with his signature 8.7cm stripes , that wowed spectators inside the museum - many of whom described the scene as ' exquisite '			0
back to the future : the @entity6 show was a vision of checks - and managed to feel both retro and futuristic at the same time ' it was already big , all i did was make it bigger , ' said @entity8 of his transformation of this most famous of @entity9 art galleries			1
' it was others that called me a minimalist , not me			0
' of course , the sky 's the limit when you 're backed by @entity56 's richest man and @entity58 - owner @entity57 , with whom @entity8 mingled before the show			1
from a fashion point of view , the collection was certainly unforgettable , with 64 retro looks with echoes of @entity64 making a bold optical statement			1
while most silhouettes were slim and clean , subtle volume came in the form of gentle puffed shoulders or a flippy pleat at the bottom of a miniskirt			0
miniskirts , beehives and exposed midriffs galore pointed to one thing : the swinging sixties are back ( viz @entity79 's flower power show earlier this week )			1
simple silhouettes were decked out in @entity4 , while skirt and trouser suits made an impact in taupe , black and white geometric prints			0
@entity6 is a house that is proud of its tradition , but also likes to evolve			0
the collection saw the ubiquitous monogram banished for the first time			0
instead , one recurrent feature was - according to the show notes - ' the smallest sequins ever produced			2
' thousands of those microscopic sequins added dazzle to the @entity4 check and brought metallic shimmer to dresses and skirt suits			2
' it 's all about being graphic , ' @entity15 said after the show			1
and yes , it most certainly was			0
drama : @entity15 ' chose dramatic staging that saw models in chartreuse column dresses and maxi skirts descend escalators into the show space taking a bow : @entity15 receives his applause at the bottom of the stairs as the show ends @entity6 's trademark @entity4 check was used in jumbo form across slim column skirts and maxi dresses			1
the check - most commonly seen in the contrasting brown and tan of the @entity6 brand , was given a @entity125 makeover in bright yellow , black and white or greys and browns gently puffed shoulders added volume , while exposed midriffs suggested next summer we 'll be seeing a lot more exposed stomachs			2
right : pleated mini skirts and bows in beehive - styled hair gave @entity125 - style dresses a cute twist a micro shorts suit would suit the younger @entity6 fan , while the tunic would look just as sophisticated over a pair of white trousers			0
right : @entity145 has been a strong theme of all three fashion weeks so far , joining a bold palette including hot pink , bright red and juicy orange as colours we 'll be wearing next spring setting the scene : the @entity24 was transformed by artist @entity8 , adding his own distinctive stripes to the escalator , and @entity6 's checks to the runway itself			1
