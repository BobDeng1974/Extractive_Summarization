on tuesday , @entity7 posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with @entity14 were ' out of line ' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize			1
' having reflected on my interaction with @entity14 , including what i said and how i said it , it ’s clear that i was very much out of line , ' wrote @entity7 on his website			1
' i aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others , no matter what the situation			0
clearly i failed to do so			0
i am sorry , and i intend to do better in the future			0
' @entity52 said he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well			2
@entity14 said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as @entity56 offering donations and support with his website and legal advice			1
apologetic : @entity14 , the son of the restaurant 's owners who manages the @entity64 , located inside the @entity66 location of @entity9 , responded to @entity7 in a courteous way ' i just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress			1
we have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family			0
your support and kind words are more then enough , ' he wrote			2
@entity14 said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received ' overwhelming ' support from @entity1 graduates and the student body			1
' i believe that one man ’s actions should not be the burden of another			0
i just want to apologize to @entity1 for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal			1
i also believe that something good can come out of all this situation , ' he wrote			0
@entity14 manages the @entity64 , located inside the @entity66 location of @entity9 , a @entity3 restaurant founded by his parents and appeared in a recent issue of @entity102 hailed as ' @entity103 '			2
the incident began on friday when @entity7 ordered $ 53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $ 4 more than he had added up using the online menu			1
he emailed the restaurant , who admitted that their website was ' out of date ' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $ 1 , causing the @entity1 professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by @entity118			1
scene : @entity7 had ordered takeout from the @entity9 in @entity10 ( pictured ) ' under @entity123 law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price , ' @entity7 wrote			1
' i urge you to cease this practice immediately			0
' in the interim , i suggest that @entity9 refund me three times the amount of the overcharge			2
' the tripling reflects the approach provided under the @entity123 consumer protection statute , @entity137 , wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations			2
' please refund the $ 12 to my credit card			1
or you could mail a check for $ 12 to my home			1
' @entity7 recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from @entity14			2
' we are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic @entity9 cuisine , ' @entity14 wrote			1
' i will honor the website price and honor you the $ 3.00			2
' however this only seemed to infuriate @entity7 further			2
not happy : after initally going to great lengths to get the restaurant to credit him $ 12 over the so - called mishap , @entity7 has now apologized profusely for his bullying behavior ' it strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred , ' @entity7 wrote back			1
' to wit , your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout			2
' you did so knowingly , knowing that your website was out of date			2
' you do n't seem to recognize that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far - reaching resolution			0
' nor do you recognize the principle , well established in applicable laws , that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer , the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge			0
' @entity14 responded with an obvious question : ' you seem like a smart man			0
but is this really worth your time ? ' again , @entity7 came back firing			0
' you 're right that i have better things to do , ' @entity7 's replied			2
popular : @entity14 was featured in @entity102 last month and hailed as ' @entity191 's most imaginative bartender ' ' if you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund i requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it			0
' the more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault , the more determined i am to seek a greater sanction against you			0
' @entity7 ' passed the matter on to the authorities ' in @entity10			1
@entity14 wrote back : ' once again thank you for bringing it to my attention , i will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation			0
' once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you , we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on			0
' i will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill			0
' i have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit			0
' i hope you understand i want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly			0
' i will keep you updated as soon as they contact me			0
' according to @entity118 , besides @entity1 , @entity7 also operates a consulting practice that works at ' preventing and detecting online fraud ( especially advertising fraud ) '			1
his clients include @entity227 , the @entity228 , the @entity229 , and @entity230			0
@entity7 sent a statement to @entity232 saying he believes how he handled the situation with @entity9 was helping other people as well			1
' we all rely on trust in our daily lives , that when sales tax is added , it actually applies and equals the specified amount ; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance ; that when you order takeout , the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant , ' he told the website			1
' we all take most of this for granted			0

@entity23 , an associate professor of business administration at @entity1 , posted his apology on his website on *wednesday*
