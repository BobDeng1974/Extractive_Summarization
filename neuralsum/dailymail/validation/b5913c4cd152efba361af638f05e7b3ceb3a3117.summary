property tycoon @entity15 bought it as a rundown wreck for £ 5 million in 2006 and then set about transforming the property into his dream home			1

there is 24,000 sq / ft of space on a 2.4 - acre plot , with an exceptional frontage and thus , the property has huge kerb appeal for an ultra-high net worth purchaser			1

' our objective was to acquire it for our client who recognised the immense potential of @entity8			0
they are naturally very excited about buying it and intend to spend many millions upgrading the property			0
' the accommodation is arranged over three floors only which is very unusual as most trophy homes in @entity2 with similar square footage invariably have 30 - 40 per cent of the accommodation below ground			2
' i firmly believe that , in the right hands , the property has the credentials to command a figure in the region of £ 50 million as in many respects , it is the ultimate trophy home			1
' needless to say , we are thrilled to have successfully acquired the property for our client			0
