commands will be sent to @entity9 today instructing the rover to collect a third scoop of soil from the ' @entity17 ' site of windblown @entity8 sand and dust where the rover is currently			1
it comes after engineers decided to abandon one scoop after spotting shiny material they believe may have fallen off the rover			1
its robotic arm scooped a sample and shook the dust and grains over the scooper ’s metal surfaces			0
the ‘ used ’ soil was then unceremoniously dumped			0
the is being done to scrub away any terrestrial contaminants , such as fine layers of oil that may have settled on the instrument after leaving @entity46 ’s clean rooms			0
manipulating the rover 's robotic scoop , engineers sent commands to simply dump the scoop , before digging for another one			1
however , they are now interested in signs of another shiny material on the martian surface - believed to be of @entity8 origin			1
pending evaluation of this , the engineering team say a sample from the scoopful is planned as the first sample for delivery - later this week - to one of the rover 's internal analytical instruments , the @entity69 ( @entity68 ) instrument			0
a later scoopful will become the first solid sample for delivery to the rover 's other internal analytical instrument , the @entity75 at @entity8 ( @entity77 ) instrument			1
the rover 's second scoopful , collected on @entity80 ( oct. 12 ) , was intentionally discarded a day later due to concern about particles of bright material seen in the hole dug by the scooping			1
other small pieces of bright material in the @entity17 area have been assessed as debris from the spacecraft , @entity46 said			0
' the science team did not want to put spacecraft material into the rover 's sample - processing mechanisms , ' it said in a statement			0
' confidence for going ahead with the third scooping was based on new assessment that other bright particles in the area are native @entity8 material			2
' one factor in that consideration is seeing some bright particles embedded in clods of @entity8 soil			2
the rover has also spotted some unique shiny objects in the soil which the team hope to analyse			2
although some particles nearby were explained as debris from the rover , @entity46 believes these images show martian material a clod of soil near the top center of the image above contains a light - toned particle			1
the observation that the particle is embedded in the clod led scientists to assess this particle as @entity8 material , not something from the spacecraft as they had first assumed			2
this assessment prompted the mission to continue scooping in the area , despite observations of a despite observations of a few light - toned particles in the area being scooped			0
researchers have also taken more pictures of a piece of material discovered near the rover			0
it initially baffled @entity46 , but it is now believed to be a small piece of plastic dislodged during the rover 's trip and landing on the red planet			0
the rover also sent back new high resolution pictures of a piece of debris engineers now believe fell from the rover			2
