as if @entity0 has n't had enough leaks of late			0
for a short time on friday night , the official website of sunday 's @entity3 posted what appeared to be this year 's winners in two top globes categories , setting off some momentary excitement in the industry trade press			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were named as the two top winners for the 72nd annual @entity3 , which are set for sunday night			1
scroll down for @entity12 whoops ? ! this grab of the @entity3 website from the @entity15 shows the captions reveal @entity9 and into the @entity17 are winners , while keeping pictures of last year 's winners , 12 years a slave and @entity22 the @entity15 , which runs the annual awards , referred all inquiries to its site administrator , @entity26			1
' while testing the official website of the @entity3 for sunday 's ceremony , @entity26 inadvertently took the test live , ' said a company statement			2
' we randomly selected two film titles with no knowledge of the category winners			0
we are solely responsible for the error			0
' the apparent inadvertent reveal named @entity9 , the historical drama about @entity38 and the civil rights movement , as the winner of the outstanding motion picture in the drama category			2
front runner : @entity9 , which documents the work of @entity38 and the civil rights movement is a favorite for @entity47 's glory stars : @entity49 is one of the stars of @entity10 , which also features new @entity52 host @entity51 fantasy drama , @entity10 , which stars upcoming @entity52 host @entity51 , was named as the best motion picture , musical or comedy			1
