@entity101 : but while the pictures may seem charming , the @entity51 armbands worn by the teenagers hint at the dark truth gathering : one image shows all the participants in the @entity35 standing under a huge swastika flag @entity110 , a historian at the @entity111 , said : ' although it was never compulsory to join the @entity5 , in practice it more or less was			1
' parents really had to send their sons along for training			0
the @entity117 represented it as a @entity41 version of the @entity120 - which it certainly was not			0
' the boys were soldiers of tomorrow and the training had a strong military element to it and involved firearms			0
' a lot of the @entity5 were drafted in the the anti-aircraft batteries but those who had a reputation for being fairly awesome fighters joined the @entity131 outing : other images appear to show the @entity5 outside the setting of the camp on a visit to a city collection : these photo albums are going up for auction in @entity33 and are set to fetch £ 750 ' in the last days of the war the @entity5 was mobilised in the @entity41 version of the @entity142 and fought on both eastern and western fronts			1
