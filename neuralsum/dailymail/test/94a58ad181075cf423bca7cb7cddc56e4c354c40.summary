@entity0 argued that animals can express emotions with their face and body , like humans do			0
now researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents			1
the study suggests that as well as expressing their emotional state , the pained faces of rats may have a ‘ communicative function ’			2
they may even use expressions to warn other rats of danger or ask for help			2
researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents			1
researchers based at different institutions in @entity26 , noted that rats flatten their ears , narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain ( shown in the images on the right ) – an observation in previous studies researchers based at different institutions in @entity26 , noted that rats flatten their ears , narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain – an observation in previous studies			1
the experts wanted to find out whether the rodents do this as a reflex reaction , or to communicate their discomfort to others			2
they found that @entity49 rats can read pain on other animal ’s faces and use the information to makes decisions , @entity47 reported			2
the scientists first took photographs of rats who were in pain and others with neutral expressions			1
to test the rodents ' response to rats ’ pained expressions , they showed them the photos in a specially made cage , to test whether they responded to the face , rather than the smell of another animal , for example			1
the rats chosen are described as ‘ naive ’ in the study , published in the journal @entity76 , and were between eight and 12 months old			0
individuals were put into a cage composed of three interconnecting rooms , one of which had images of a rat in pain , which had been given an electric shock			2
to test the rodent ’s response to rats ’ pained expressions , they showed them the photos in a specially made cage ( pictured )			1
they found that rats spent less time in the room showing rodents in pain , than they did in the other compartment showing rats with neutral facial expressions male mice sing to woo females , scientists claim			1
they also change their tune depending on whether she is within sight or not			0
the females , meanwhile , seem to like some of the songs more than others			0
in a quirky study that could shed help shed light on autism and other conditions that involve difficulties in communication , researchers from @entity109 in @entity110 studied male mice that were either placed in a cage with a female – or one with just her scent			2
special equipment was used to record and analyse their squeaks , which are so high - pitched that people ca n’t hear them			0
this revealed that they sang one song when they could simply smell a female and another one when they could see her			0
when they could merely smell a potential mate , they belted out an extremely shrill and complex song , perhaps in an attempt to make themselves known			0
but when she was within sight , they serenaded her more softly			0
these songs also had a more simple structure and were longer			0
they entered one - by - one through a central compartment without any images on the walls and made their way to a compartment off the central room with pictures of pained rats on the walls and another offshoot room with photos of happier rats on the walls			2
each rat was allowed to wander freely around the cage for 10 minutes while the researchers recorded how long it spent in each room			1
they found that rats spent more time in the rooms where they did n’t have to confront the image of a rat in pain			1
' … the rats stayed longer in the compartment with the images of neutral expressions than in that with the images of pain expressions , ’ the study says			1
‘ this indicates that the rats were able to discriminate the category of emotional expression			0
’ on average , they spent one minute less in the pain room , than the compartment showing a rat with a neutral expression			1
while the scientists did n’t say that the study suggests mice can empathise , they believe that their facial expressions have evolved to communicate pain			1
they wrote : ‘ emotional expression in rodents , rather than just a mere “ expression ” of emotional states , might have a communicative function			0
’ ‘ the emotional expression of pain might have an adaptive function for both the expresser and receiver , such as emitting a warning signal or promoting carer behaviour from the receiver , ’ they hypothesised			0
previous studies have shown that several kinds of primates make faces and can discriminate between different expressions .			0

researchers in @entity26 placed rats in a cage with three compartments
one room showed photos of rats in pain , and another with neutral faces
rats spent more time in the ' neutral ' room suggesting they recognise fear
experts believe facial expressions are used to communicate with others
