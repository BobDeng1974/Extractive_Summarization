the ultimate water fight is on with not one but two street water slides headed for @entity3 's @entity2			2
radio station @entity4 has announced it will be transforming @entity6 on january 24 into a giant slide			1
the station will beat @entity9 to the punch who publicised the same event on the same street but for february 15 and march 9 earlier this month			2
' we â€™re taking this @entity27 backyard tradition to the next level , ' the station 's website read			2
' get your mates together and get ready for some adrenaline pumping slip - sliding fun and much more to keep you entertained throughout the day			0
' like @entity9 's @entity22 has reassured the street slide will be recycling the water used on the day			1
' the event organisers will pay local authorities to access water equivalent to 300 average showers , which will be circulated and reused throughout the slide during the course of the day , ' its website said			0
' the water will be constantly monitored , filtered and tested to ensure that @entity46 regulations are met and exceeded			0
' similar to the one in @entity47 ( pictured above ) , @entity22 's will transform @entity3 's @entity6			1
this follows @entity49 announced it would do the same in november , it is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down @entity18 in @entity47			1
when @entity9 announced its @entity55 event , it claimed the slide would be ' the longest city street slide anywhere in the world '			1
it promises to be three lanes wide and 400 metres long			1
like @entity22 's version , @entity9 guarantees no drop will go to waste			1
its ' @entity65 ' outlines the slide 's water consumption equals that of 400 showers			0
the used water will then be recycled and used to keep @entity3 's gardens looking green			0
but it is also asking participants to do their bit as well			0
' imagine if on the day you slide with us , you promise to only have a two - minute shower , ' @entity9 's website said			2
' if you promise to do that then you and @entity49 could actually save over 100,000 litres of water			0
' for a $ 40 and a ' small booking fee ' , sliders can get the most bang out of their buck for two hours			0
@entity9 said ticket holders could fit in at least three slides in their session			0
like @entity9 's @entity22 has reassured the street slide will be recycling the water used on the day both events will transform @entity6 in @entity3 into a giant water slide @entity9 's will be 400 metres long , while @entity22 's will be 315 metres long			1

@entity22 will transform @entity6 in @entity2 into giant slide
it comes after @entity9 announced it would do the same this month
radio station 's will be 315 metres long , while the other will be 400 metres
it follows *success* of a similar one in @entity47 , which *attracted* 11,000 sliders
