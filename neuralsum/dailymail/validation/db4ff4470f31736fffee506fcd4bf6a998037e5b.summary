for more than 16 years the @entity0 and its team of astronauts have given us unprecedented access to breathtaking and awe - inspiring sights of our planet			1
and now the current crew , on @entity7 , has created a collection bringing together some of the most stunning images of @entity12 's landscapes			1
from the glittering lights over the @entity16 to the sand dunes in @entity18 and the concrete nature of @entity20 , the world 's varied landmarks have been recorded from on board the orbiting craft			1
it has distinctive dune formations and covers 250,000 square miles ( 650,000 square kilometres ) including regions of @entity29 , @entity18 , the @entity30 , and @entity31 the current @entity7 crew on @entity0 has created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on @entity12			1
one of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of @entity40 and the north coast of @entity42 , taken above the @entity16 in january ( pictured )			1
it shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the @entity49 glows all of these images form part of the @entity52 : landscapes by @entity55 collection			1
ms @entity55 is one of six astronauts on board the station as part of @entity7			1
her colleagues include commander @entity61 , flight engineer @entity62 and @entity64 cosmonauts @entity63 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
the expedition began on 9 november last year , when @entity68 undocked and they are due to return in may			1
one of the most striking images in the collection shows the glittering lights of the south coast of @entity40 and the north coast of @entity42 , taken above the @entity16 in january			1
it shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance , on the curvature of the @entity12 , a green light that looks like the @entity49 glows			1
a second image was taken above the big island of @entity83 in the @entity84			2
it was captured on 28 february and the peaks of volcanoes @entity87 and @entity89 can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile ( 10,432 square kilometre ) land mass. @entity87 is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes the expedition also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of @entity20			1
the grey , concrete - coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean			0
in particular , the midtown areas of @entity104 are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black			0
larger , more open spaces of airports including @entity108 can just be distinguished the entire @entity0 was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station			1
the remarkable manoeuvre saw a @entity115 spacecraft ‘ slow ’ the speed of the station			2
this changed the height of its orbit by about 1.6 miles ( 2.5km ) , before the station was spun back again to its original position			2
a second image was taken above the big island of @entity83 in the @entity84			0
it was captured on 28 february and the peaks of volcanoes @entity87 and @entity89 can be seen towards the centre of the 4,028 square mile ( 10,432 square kilometre ) land mass. @entity87 is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes			0
it does n't erupt as frequently @entity132 , but when it does eruptions produce rivers of lava that have threatened the nearby town of @entity137			0
it rises almost 5.5 miles ( 9km ) and almost 90 per cent of its surface is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old			0
from the relatively remote island of @entity83 , the expedition has also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of @entity20			2
the grey , concrete - coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean			0
further west , ms @entity148 captured this image above @entity151 in @entity152			1
the snow - topped mountains in the region , including @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 are shown			0
the small lake in the bottom of the picture is called @entity162 with @entity163 in the centre			0
the park covers a staggering 1,190 square miles ( 3,081 square kilometres ) during its orbit over @entity168 , the crew captured the coastline of @entity170 ( pictured )			2
the coastline is rocky and jagged , especially near @entity172 , and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles ( 6,942 km ) @entity174 from the @entity175 of @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , told @entity178 this image of @entity12 shows the @entity180 , in particular @entity181 , @entity182 to the left and @entity184 to the right of centre in particular , the midtown areas of @entity104 are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black			1

during its orbit over @entity168 and heading across the @entity203 and into @entity204 the crew captured the coastline of @entity170 , @entity206 and @entity207 , and @entity208			1
the coastline of @entity170 is rocky and jagged , especially near @entity172 and its total coastline stretches for 4,313 miles ( 6,942 km )			0
elsewhere in @entity168 , @entity210 between @entity211 and @entity212 is shown , photographed from almost 250 miles ( 400km ) in orbit around the @entity12			1
it is the world 's largest manmade lake and reservoir and was filled in the early 1960s after the @entity217 was completed			0
@entity207 is a petroglyph site in the @entity219 , @entity206 , around 74 miles ( 120km ) to northwest of @entity220			0
the majority of the 5,000 petroglyphs are in the main canyon and are mostly from the @entity224			0
the name @entity207 in @entity206 means ' painted or marked place ' and the region became a @entity228 in 2004			0
over @entity208 , ms @entity229 photographed the @entity231 - an area of the @entity233 country where @entity231 flows into the @entity234			1
on either side of the delta are @entity237 and @entity238 and the dry arid region receives between 10 and 19 inches ( 25 and 50cm ) of rainfall a year			2
the delta is home to mangrove forests as well as the @entity244			0
the crew also captured distinctive dune formations of the @entity24 , also known as the ' @entity24			2

on either side of the delta is the @entity237 and @entity238 and the dry arid region receives between 10 and 19 inches ( 25 and 50cm ) of rainfall a year the @entity0 marked its 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 november 2010 and since expedition 1 in 2000 the space station has been visited by more than 215 people			1
as of november 2014 , there have been 100 @entity64 launches , 37 space shuttle launches , one test flight and three operational flights by @entity271 ’s @entity270 as well as a test flight and two operational flights by @entity275 ’s @entity274			2
a total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours , or approximately 48 days			2
the space station , including its large solar arrays , spans the area of a @entity284 football field , including the end zones , and weighs 924,739 pounds			2
the complex now has more livable room than a conventional six - bedroom house , and has two bathrooms , a gymnasium and a 360 - degree bay window .			0

the @entity0 will *celebrate* its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation in november
its current crew , on @entity7 , has created a collection of stunning images taken from the station of @entity12
landscapes include the @entity16 , the @entity231 in @entity208 and @entity151
the expedition began on 9 november last year , when @entity68 undocked , and the crew is due to return in may
