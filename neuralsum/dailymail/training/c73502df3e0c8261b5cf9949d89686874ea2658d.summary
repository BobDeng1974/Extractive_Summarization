by @entity0 published : 12:13 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 2 january 2014 a museum is appealing for experts to help them decipher mysterious codes written on the side of a @entity7 kamikaze plane			1
the @entity9 ' @entity8 ' aircraft , captured in the @entity11 70 years ago , has been hanging in the rafters of an air museum for more than three decades			1
but when it was taken down and inspected more closely , curators found two sets of symbols etched on to the side of the plane , which was intended to be used by a suicide pilot as a flying bomb			1
antique : this @entity8 kamikaze plane from @entity7 is being restored at the @entity24 mystery : curators are appealing for experts to decipher these faded symbols on the aircraft hatch one of the messages is found on the hatch cover , which would have held more than a ton of explosive material , while the other is on the left side of the plane			1
both appear to combine @entity9 symbols with other markings whose significance is unknown			2
staff at the @entity24 in @entity42 , @entity43 are now hoping that an expert will come forward who can explain the meaning of the writing			1
@entity8 2 aircraft , which were used by the @entity9 military towards the end of the war , were deployed on kamikaze missions which killed thousands of @entity54 sailors			1
display : the plane has been hanging from the rafters of the museum in @entity42 , @entity43 for three decades bizarre : the drawings are a combination of @entity9 characters and mysterious marks insignia : the plane is also emblazoned with a cherry blossom , which gives the aircraft its name they were fixed to the underside of bomber planes , before being flown up to a height of 12,000ft and released			1
the vessels would be piloted by suicide pilots , who aimed for @entity54 ships and would inevitably die on impact			0
they could travel unaided for 21 miles , reaching a maximum speed of 475mph			0
only 800 of the aircraft were ever made			0
the name of the plane means ' cherry blossom ' in @entity9 , and a picture of the flower is painted on its side along with the mysterious symbols			1
in action : a photograph of the @entity8 flying bomb when it was in use during @entity7 crashed : an @entity8 plane captured in @entity91 after failing to hit its @entity54 military target the model held by the @entity24 is believed to have been captured by @entity54 troops in the @entity11			1
it is owned by the @entity96 in @entity97 , which lent it to the @entity24 in 1982			2
' it is chilling to look through the cockpit window of this piloted rocket and through the ringed sight , ' said @entity103 of the the @entity24			2
' there 's a grab handle fixed to the inner wall of the cockpit as acceleration generated by the three solid fuel rockets would have been incredible			0
' the aircraft is set to undergo a forensic restoration , with layers of paint being stripped off to reveal its original colour and markings			0
fearsome : a group of suicide pilots waiting to be dispatched on their deadly final missions kamikaze missions are notorious due to the fanatical devotion shown by @entity9 suicide pilots over the last few months of @entity7			2
the pilots would fly in planes packed full of explosives and direct them into @entity54 ships in a bid to cripple the war effort in the @entity11 theatre			2
thousands of @entity54 sailors were killed in the attacks , which continued until the end of the war in september 1945 , according to experts			0
the advantage of kamikaze attacks was that planes being piloted right up to the moment of impact were able to hit their targets more accurately than bombs dropped from a height			0
to begin with , the air force simply used conventional planes fitted with explosives , but they soon developed purpose - built aircraft such as the @entity8 2			1
nearly 4,000 @entity9 pilots lost their lives in the missions , but the death toll was considered acceptable because of the huge damage they could do by taking out large ships			0
however , fewer than 15 per cent of kamikaze attacks are thought to have been successful , with the vast majority missing their targets			0
attack : a kamikaze mission on the @entity158 carried out in may 1945			0

@entity8 2 plane was captured in the @entity11 and ended up on display at the @entity24 in @entity42
when it was being restored experts found *undecipherable* @entity9 codes
curators want experts to help them work out what the symbols mean
