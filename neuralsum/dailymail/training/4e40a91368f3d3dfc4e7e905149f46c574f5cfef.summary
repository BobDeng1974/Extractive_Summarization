hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts to stop them overbreeding on @entity3 the unusual move to dose 300 of the ponies is the latest attempt to control growing numbers ' they just bounce forward and carry on eating , as if they had just had a bee sting , ' she told the @entity32			1
' everything is about making it the very best as we can do it and it seems to be working very well			0
' at the moment there is a problem – we need the ponies to look after the habitat but the by - product of that is foals – we need the stallion to keep the mares in the right place and this is the end result			0
' we now have about 100 on this drug but we wo n't know the final result of the trial until may			0
' each gas - fired dart contains a dose of the drug @entity53 , a much cheaper and longer - lasting way to prevent mares becoming pregnant than the old system of injections			1
conservationist @entity7 ( pictured ) has been roaming moorland in the @entity10 national park firing doses into the hides of mares using a gas powered rifle ' the gun has been brought over from @entity65 and uses an infra - red beam to judge the distance so you do n't overshoot or hit them too powerfully – their welfare has been really carefully worked out			2
' once the pony has been dosed a sharp - eyed assistant needs to retrieve the tiny dart			0
ms @entity7 has previously spoken out in favour of eating ponies to save their species , saying a meat trade should improve a pony 's chances of finding a new home			1
' strangely , having a meat trade should improve a pony 's chances of finding a new home at sales , ' she wrote in a letter to @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , the numbers of hill ponies have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today the native ponies – not to be confused with their pure - bred @entity3 cousins – are an essential part of the ecology of the national park by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control			1
but their numbers have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today			0
with ponies selling for as little as £ 10 at auction , they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation			0
in 2013 it emerged that unwanted @entity3 ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos and their hides were being crafted into ' wild pony ' drums			0
ms @entity7 said she believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a ' sustainable market ' for them			2
the tails of the ponies shot with contraceptive darts are trimmed back to mark them out in the autumn			1
the initiative has been backed by @entity126 and the @entity127 .			0
