a devoted dad who has snapped a picture of his son nearly every day since he was born has turned them into a touching film charting his life - from bouncing baby boy to blowing out the candles on his 21st birthday cake			1
@entity10 's video clip - which speeds through pictures of his son @entity12 asleep , laughing and pulling faces - has now become an internet sensation after the proud father posted his labour of love on @entity18			1
the six - and - a - half minute time - lapse film , which has been watched over 600,000 times online , is believed to be the first of its kind			1
' it was a daft idea really			2
one i came up with after a drink or two , maybe , ' said mr @entity10 , from @entity37 , @entity38			1
' i was thinking i could do it for two years at most			2
' but then you get to the point where you wonder if you 'll regret it if you stop			2
you brush your teeth twice a day , what 's hard about a click ? ' this boy 's life : @entity10 's film shows his son @entity12 as a toddler on @entity51 , left , and smiling for the camera in the garden , right growing boy : @entity55 gave @entity57 instructions to take his own picture when he was away on school trips or holidays to make sure the record was as complete as possible mr @entity10 duly stuck to his routine of taking his son 's picture almost every day for more than two decades - although minor mishaps along the way mean there are a couple of gaps in his record of @entity12 growing up			1
a whole month 's worth of pictures were lost at one point when the film in his camera was n't winding , and on another occasion it was stolen while the family were on holiday in @entity79			2
' i used to find it awkward , i did n't realise the value of it ' @entity84 at other times , the clock slipped past midnight before mr @entity10 realised he had n't taken a picture , but @entity12 said his dad never succumbed to the temptation of substituting a photo from another day			1
' he 's never cheated , ' he said			2
' even at five minutes past , he would n't take it			0
' mr @entity10 , who said he panicked the first time a day was missed , has slotted sketches of his son into his time - lapse film to make up the gaps			1
persistent mr @entity10 followed @entity12 to friends ' houses and armed his son with a camera of his own for school trips and holidays to make sure the photo record was as complete as possible			1
when the 21 - year - old spent three months travelling around @entity104 with friends last year , his dad made sure he did n't miss a single day			1
' my dad 's had to drive to a friend 's house before , ' @entity12 said			1
' i got a bit of stick for that			0
i used to find it awkward , i did n’t realise the value of it			0
' it was only when i got to 16 or 17 that i started to appreciate it , and realise what it could be , ' he said			0
school days : @entity12 says he is n't fazed by his father 's epic project , which takes in pictures of him in school uniform , left , and pulling faces for the camera , right growing up : @entity12 , now 21 , is seen with friends as a teenager , left , and as a student at @entity131 , right , where he is studying film and television production the film starts with the first picture of @entity12 as a newborn at @entity137 , and documents school days , childhood football matches , new jobs and trips to @entity143 and @entity144 in @entity145			1
but the majority of the pictures were taken at home , typical photos of a cherished son ; eating an ice - cream , enjoying a family @entity153 , or suffering with a hangover			1
' there are lots i look back at now and think i wish i had n’t pulled that face , ' said the @entity159 fan			0
mr @entity10 said he had been left stunned by the overwhelming response to the results of his ' chaotic ' project			1
' we just did n’t know , ' he said			0
' it was like we were unleashing something unreal			0
i had been a bit wary , my hand hovered over the upload button			0
it was like opening @entity171			0
' when i started this , there was no @entity18 , ' added mr @entity10 , who works at a picture framers and also as a care assistant with disabled adults			1
' all i had in mind was a video			2
that was as far as the idea went			0
' labour of love : @entity10 , seen left with @entity12 , has now handed over the project to his son , who has left home to study film and television production at @entity131 @entity55 spent three months scanning the pictures one at a time last year			1
in the end there were more than 7,500 images , in 71 albums			2
' it ’s never been straightforward			0
we were n’t organised , it ’s always been chaotic , ' he said			0
in the two weeks it has been online , the video has had more than 610,000 hits			2
bizarrely , 300,000 of these were in @entity203 in just one day last week , and @entity12 has seen his @entity205 followers increase dramatically after a particularly enthusiastic response from female viewers of the video			1
' i 'm not fazed by it , it 's like i 'm on @entity211 , ' he said			0
' someone commented that i should show my face more , but then someone else pointed out that it shows a story			0
you ca n’t say i ’ve got a boring life			0
' the project is still ongoing , but is in @entity12 ’s hands now as he is living with friends while studying film and television production at @entity131			2
' when do you stop ? ' he asked			0
' i do n’t think i can			0
we ’ve come this far , we may as well carry on			0
