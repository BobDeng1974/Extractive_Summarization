by @entity0 and @entity1 he was making a speech about the rights of working fathers to see their families			1
so who better for deputy prime minister @entity7 to call on for support than his wife @entity10			1
@entity12 - born mrs @entity11 appeared to hijack her husband ’s press conference with a colourful intervention , suggesting that men who treat women as equals have ‘ more cojones ’ than those who do n’t			1
for those whose @entity12 is a little rusty , cojones means b * * * s. ms cojones : @entity11 was told men who treat women as equals have more ' b * * * s ' ... by his own wife @entity10 it seemed to be a spontaneous interjection , but aides admitted it had been planned to generate publicity about an issue the couple believe needs debating			1
‘ it was just a slightly different way of making an important point , ’ an aide said			0
mrs @entity11 also hit out at ‘ dinosaurs ’ who believe childcare should be left to women and asked her husband to send out a message that caring for children ‘ does not affect your level of testosterone ’			1
mr @entity7 feigned surprise at her intervention , joking to the audience : ‘ gosh , @entity10 has put up her hand			2
i ’m terrified about what is about to come			0
’ he began his answer : ‘ of course , i agree with you			2
’ speaking yesterday at the launch of @entity61 , an organisation for working fathers in the @entity63 , mr @entity7 said it was time bosses stopped ‘ raising an eyebrow ’ when men asked for time off work to care for their children			1
it was a highly unusual intervention from the @entity72 's wife , who is normally very careful not to comment on politics he said fathers should not be made to see themselves as breadwinners rather than carers			2
mrs @entity11 , a lawyer who earns four times as much as her husband , then put her hand up and said : ‘ this is the moment of truth			2
you have spoken a lot about measures , which is all well and good			0
but an awful lot is about attitudes			0
‘ there are many , many dinosaurs , not here but out there , that still think that a man who takes care of his own children , he is some kind of less of a man			0
' so if you and other modern working fathers could start saying not only loudly , but also proudly , that taking care of your own children and being responsible for those children does not affect your level of testosterone – and that men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones			1
’ mr @entity7 joked that he would not be translating ‘ cojones ’ for the audience			0
he said he ‘ massively agreed ’ with his wife , adding : ‘ the idea that it is not manly to care is as absurd as saying that it is not womanly to work			0
’ @entity7 ’s salary is vastly outstripped by his wife			0
