a teenager is living a unique double life both as a man - and a woman			0
some days @entity4 , 18 , wakes up and chooses to wear a dress and heels to work , while others she 's a man and dons baggy jeans and workmen boots			1
the youth centre volunteer from @entity12 , @entity13 , can spend as long as three months as her male counterpart @entity14 then suddenly switch to @entity4 for as little as a day			1
but , at the age of 16 , she realised that she missed the feminine side of herself and gradually realised that she identifies as bi-gender , a term used for people who move between both sexes			1
some past employers have done a double take when @entity4 suddenly turns up for work dressed as @entity14			1
@entity4 said : ' it is very confusing when i first meet someone			2
a lot of people just do n't understand it as it 's something they 've never come across before			0
@entity4 says she has no control over whether she 's going to be @entity14 ( above ) or @entity37 on a certain day ' it is n't a case of me waking up and choosing to dress a certain way			1
i 've got no control over whether i 'm going to be @entity14 or @entity4 on a certain day			1
' living as bi-gender is extremely frustrating			2
' as @entity4 , i wear lots of make up and love showing off my cleavage			2
yet , when i 'm @entity14 , the sight of my breasts make me cry and i hate my feminine body			1
' it 's painful but i bind my breasts and often wear a fake facial hair to give me a more masculine look , ' she explains			2
the youth centre volunteer from @entity12 , @entity13 , identifies as bi-gender @entity4 's unusual gender identity does n't just affect her clothes , it also affects her sexuality			1
as @entity14 , she is attracted to women and , as @entity37 , she is attracted to men			1
' relationships are nearly impossible as i constantly switch between two genders			1
i 've been on dates before and i do get chatted up but it never goes any further as they find it hard to come to grips with my situation , ' says @entity4			2
her mannerisms even change , with friends saying that is she is much quieter and more giggly when she is @entity4 while @entity14 is outspoken and fiery			1
@entity14 loves football and is a bit of a lad and @entity4 prefers time alone and hates sports			1
growing up with her aunt , @entity4 first began questioning her sexuality when she was 13 , originally identifying as bisexual and then wondering if she could be transgender as she felt uncomfortable with her feminine body			1
as a child she preferred trousers to skirts and begged her aunt to let her cut her hair short			0
by the time she turned 16 she was dressing as a male every day for school and , soon after , began living as transgender , binding her breasts and wearing male clothes			2
yet after two weeks she realised that she missed being a woman and found the term bi-gender while researching online			2
@entity4 says she has no control over whether she 's going to be @entity14 ( left ) or @entity37 ( right ) on a certain day @entity4 hopes to raise more awareness for bi-genderism , which has become a gender option on @entity93 she said : ' i found a bi-gender group on @entity93 with hundreds of members and suddenly i did n't quite feel so alone			1
it was an amazing moment			0
' i started talking to other bi-gender people from all over the world and at last felt comfortable in my own skin			0
' sometimes i envy people who know which gender they are supposed to be			0
for me , it 's a constant battle			0
' i have spent most of my teenage life in turmoil over this			0
sometimes , i wonder why i ca n't wake up as the same person for the rest of my life but i 've gradually learned to accept both @entity14 and @entity4			1
' being bi-gender has also caused problems for @entity4 finding work			2
after finding a bi-gender group on @entity93 with hundreds of members shed suddenly did n't feel so alone ' most employers are n't very understanding when their feminine worker suddenly turns up dressed as a man			0
no i work at a youth centre and thankfully they 're completely supportive of my gender			0
they even let me have two name tags depending on which sex i come into work as , ' she says			0
' i know some people may think it is an act , but it is something that i ca n't help			0
it is all subconscious - i even have to have two types of shower gel to please both genders			0
' it has taken a while but i have finally accepted that i am bi-gender , it is just something people have to get used to and it is completely natural			0
' @entity4 has set up an @entity93 group for people to go to for advice @entity4 hopes to raise more awareness for bi-genderism , which has recently become a gender option on @entity93			2
she has set up an @entity145 ( called lgbtq nationwide ) for people to go to for advice who may be confused over their sexuality and gender			0
@entity4 said : ' making friends is so hard , they are always really confused when they have known me as @entity14 for two or three months all of a sudden he has transformed into a woman with no explanation			1
' i have to explain myself to everyone and i wish there was more information available to people who have never heard of the term bi-gender - i still have n't met another bi-gender person			0
