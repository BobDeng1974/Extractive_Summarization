by @entity1 reporter published : 19:06 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 24 august 2013 the final winner from among the three tickets that struck gold with all the matching numbers in this month ’s $ 448 million @entity7 jackpot has finally come forward			1
the world already knew the third ticket had been sold in @entity10 , @entity11 , but @entity12 was not revealed to be the winning ticketholder from the august 7 drawing until friday			2
@entity12 ’s name was buried deep in a @entity17 press release that listed winners of lesser amounts as well as the other winners from the historic august jackpot			1
@entity12 chose a lump sum cash option totalling $ 62 million after taxes			1
solved : there was no name on this cake displayed at the @entity10 , @entity11 grocery store celebrating its sale of one of three tickets for the august 7 $ 448 million jackpot , but it has now been filled in @entity12 , who lives in the @entity33 area of @entity10 , claimed the prize along with his two adult sons , according to @entity17 spokesman @entity36			1
according to @entity39 and @entity36 , details on the lucky winner are scant			0
this , paired with his apparent unwillingness to appear at a celebratory press event suggests @entity12 and his sons have no intention of publicizing their luck any further			0
the same can not be said for the other winners			0
the first winner of the massive jackpot wasted no time in coming forward to claim his prize			2
name and a place : the @entity55 in @entity10 , @entity11 sold one of three winning tickets for the third largest @entity7 jackpot in history to @entity12 still mysterious : @entity12 's name was slyly buried a page into a @entity17 press release friday			1
unlike the other winners , he has not held a press conference a day after the numbers were picked , @entity64 and his elated girlfriend and coworkers came forward at a @entity69 press conference			1
the beaming @entity70 , @entity72 divorcee and dad held a novelty check made for the news cameras and envious public			2
the next winning ticketholders to go public at least waited a few days to get their ducks in a row before their press conference			0
but come forward they did			0
jubilant : quite unlike @entity12 , one of the other winners , @entity64 ( here with partner @entity83 ) of @entity72 all but ran to a press conference following his win the @entity88 ’s 16 , a group of 16 public employees from @entity91 , @entity11 came forward the following week to claim their chunk of the winnings			1
like @entity64 had already done and @entity12 would soon choose to do , the @entity88 ’s 16 chose a lump sum			1
each will get about $ 3.8 million after taxes , @entity36 said			0
one among the 16 , garage worker @entity97 , even achieved fleeting internet fame following the win			0
an outspoken fan of @entity102 and one of the @entity104 16 who won the other third of the jackpot holds their novelty check aloft i quit : sixteen @entity11 municipal workers won a third of the $ 448 million jackpot as a group , only the second time two jackpot winners came from the same state sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures , a t - shirt promoting the popular @entity118 reality show @entity102 , camouflage pants , sun glasses and a long beard , @entity97 gleefully proclaimed that he and his 15 co-workers were a ‘ happy bunch ’ at a @entity11 press conference			1
' we 're very happy , happy , happy , ’ @entity97 , said as he held a giant yellow check aloft and channelling the bearded @entity102 patriarch @entity129			0
but for every @entity97 and @entity64 , it seems , there is a @entity12 and we may never truly know the man behind the historic lottery win			2
the august 7 drawing marked only the second time two @entity7 jackpot tickets have ever been sold in the same state			0
in 1993 , two winners came from @entity137 , @entity137			0

like the other winners , @entity12 will take the same $ 62 million lump sum , but unlike them has *declined* to appear at any press events
the first winner to come forward was divorced dad @entity64 of @entity70 , @entity72
the so - called oceans 16 were the other winners , a group of @entity11 municipal workers
this is the first time since 1993 that two jackpot winners have come from the same state
