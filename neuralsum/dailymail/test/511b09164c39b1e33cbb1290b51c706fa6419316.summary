there ’s no doubt that @entity2 is an easy target for ex-pros and pundits			1
but when he ’s at his best he is worth paying to watch			2
i ’d much rather see a quality player do something special than a bunch of grafters with nothing to show for it			1
against @entity13 , @entity2 was at his brilliant best in a massive game			1
you do n’t become a @entity18 hero or win the @entity19 without being something special			2
@entity2 wheels away to celebrate after his brilliant first half free - kick against @entity13 @entity2 is congratulated by his team - mates during @entity25 's impressive 4 - 1 victory on saturday afternoon @entity26 has been involved in seven goals in his last eight league games , scoring three and setting up four			1
241.9 - the @entity29 sets up a goal every 241.9 minutes in the @entity31 , the seventh - best tally in the competition ’s history			1
47 - @entity2 only played for 73 minutes against @entity13 , but made 47 passes in the opposition half , more than any other player when things do n’t come off for the @entity29 , people are quick to criticise			1
we do that too much in this country — looking at what people ca n’t do rather than what they can — and it ’s where we go wrong so often			2
no , @entity2 does n’t charge around like @entity48 so people say he does n’t care			1
just ask @entity13 if @entity2 cared about the game on saturday			1
people have been quick to criticise @entity2 , but the @entity29 star is worth paying to watch when at his best hazard so cool when it counts a few weeks ago i was talking to @entity56 and we got round to discussing @entity53			1
@entity56 told me that @entity53 was the most relaxed player he had ever played with			1
he is so chilled out on and off the pitch but that ’s exactly what @entity60 needed against @entity62			1
in a match where some of his team - mates looked overcome with fear , @entity53 was playing a different game			1
he ’s only 24 but the @entity67 is already the man @entity60 seek out when they need something special			1
it was his desire and creativity that led to @entity73 ’s winner and that could be a defining result in their bid for the title			2
it ’s premature to speak of him in the same breath as @entity79 and @entity80 — @entity80 added another five on sunday to take his tally to 47 goals this season and @entity79 has 43			2
hazard has 17 , which is good , but those two are on another level			2
hazard , at least , is moving in the right direction			2
@entity53 steps up to stroke home the opener for @entity60 from the penalty spot in the first half hazard jumps in the air to celebrate his goal during the hard - fought win over @entity62 in west @entity96 @entity73 finishes to put @entity60 back in front after another driving run for the little @entity67 it ’s tough at @entity100 , even for the best ... it 's a good job @entity102 have already earned 35 points this season			1
if they had n’t , they would be in serious trouble			2
but i do n’t blame @entity109 for one second			0
even @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 would struggle with this group of players			0
it just shows you what a good job @entity118 was doing			0
he won 26 of those 35 points at 1.4 per game			0
since he left , @entity102 average 0.8 per game			0
@entity109 looks on as his @entity102 team suffer a @entity126 defeat against @entity127 against @entity127 , they were poor and the fans deserve better			0
they love a hero in the @entity131 , but where is the stardust in that team right now ? as for @entity127 , that is such a big result for them and @entity136 at the bottom			0
@entity139 ’s strike was absolutely fantastic and i ca n’t remember the last time we had such a good weekend for great goals			0
@entity139 ( centre ) fires a left - footed volley past @entity145 to give @entity127 a 1 - 0 lead @entity139 celebrates after his stunning volley put @entity127 into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity102 @entity62 must be feeling the pressure who would have thought at the start of 2015 that @entity152 would be sitting fourth in the table ahead of their game on monday night ? on january 1 , they were level on points at the top with @entity60 and had the same goal difference , too			1
now @entity25 and @entity160 have overtaken them and they face a real fight just to finish second			1
that is not how the owners , players or manager will have expected things to go after winning the title last season and investing heavily in the summer			2
they need a result at @entity171 , but that is easier said than done these days			0
@entity173 will be feeling the pressure as his @entity152 side sit in fourth place @entity177 will know they must beat @entity171 on monday night to stay in the title race with @entity181 gone , @entity180 is the star at the start of the season , i picked out @entity180 as one to watch			1
as the weeks went by , i started to wonder if i ’d made a mistake			0
i watched him at @entity187 and he ’s always had something about him			0
he ’s powerful and is built for the @entity189			0
he ’s strong , you can play off him and he ’s technically very good — his two finishes against @entity192 were outstanding			0
when @entity181 left , i feared for @entity193 , but @entity180 has come into his own			1
it shows how well that club is run			0
even when they lose players like @entity181 or @entity199 , they have already lined up quality replacements and the same goes for the managers			1
it ’s good to see @entity180 finally becoming the player i expected him to be			1
@entity180 unleashes a thunderous overhead kick shortly before half - time against @entity192 on saturday @entity180 roars with celebration after giving @entity193 a 2 - 0 lead against @entity192 at the @entity208 @entity209 is raring to go much like @entity180 , @entity209 was another in my ‘ 10 to watch ’ list			1
he had a difficult start and had to win over the trust of @entity112 , but now he looks like he ’s enjoying himself			1
@entity209 is a good technician but he likes a tackle			0
i like that about him			0
at @entity217 he was not afraid to take on @entity218 after he saw @entity218 go through his pal @entity219			0
he does not fear reputations and stood up to @entity218			0
i met him in a @entity96 restaurant and he was a bright kid who clearly loves life in @entity225			2
he ’s had to be patient , but now he ’s starting to show his class			0
@entity160 star @entity209 ( right ) scores his side 's opening goal against @entity229 @entity209 , who has played his way back into the @entity102 side , celebrates opening the scoring against @entity229 1 - only once before has a @entity234 team conceded four goals at home in the @entity189 — when @entity60 beat @entity62 4 - 0 in january 2013			1
hope for @entity237 a few weeks ago in this column i said it was no time for @entity240 to be playing the kids			0
at @entity243 it was his most experienced men who gave him a result to savour			0
scoring four goals away at a team managed by @entity234 is no mean feat. @entity243 ’s defence has improved under their new boss but @entity237 were terrific			0
it was a result and a performance to give them a glimmer of hope			0
with @entity258 winning and others struggling , it makes things a whole lot more interesting in the battle at the bottom			0
@entity237 went 2 - 0 up thanks to @entity265 ( right ) and finished the first half with a 3 - 0 lead against @entity243 @entity237 boss @entity240 will hope to lead his side out of the @entity189 relegation zone			2

@entity2 was brilliant during @entity25 's 4 - 1 victory against @entity13
the @entity29 is first to get criticised , but he is a special talent
@entity53 's *composure* has been *key* for @entity60 this season
@entity173 will be feeling the pressure on monday night
@entity279 is enjoying his *football* after a difficult start
@entity180 is proving there is life after @entity181 at @entity193
