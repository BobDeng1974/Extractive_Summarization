by @entity1 science correspondent in @entity2 published : 10:54 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 18 october 2012 as any bleary - eyed plane passenger will confirm , a crying baby is almost impossible to ignore , no matter how hard you try			1
now scientists believe they may have worked out why			0
an infant ’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries do n’t , researchers found			2
researchers found that the sound of a baby crying can trigger unique emotional responses in the brain , making it impossible for us to ignore them - whether we are parents or not			1
just milliseconds after registering the cry , the brain ’s emotion centres are hard at work			1
it had been thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of sound in such a short time			2
other types of cry , including calls of animals in distress , fail to elicit the same response – suggesting the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby ’s cry			1
a team of @entity38 scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries			1
after 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up			1
their response to a baby ’s cry was particularly strong , the @entity49 ’s annual conference in @entity2 heard			2
the response was seen in both men and women – even if they had no children			0
when we hear a baby cry , after 100 milliseconds , roughly the time taken to blink , two regions of the brain that respond to emotion light up			1
the response occurs in both men and women - and in people who have no children of their own			0
experts say the response ' make sense ' from an evolutionary perspective			0
researcher dr @entity70 said : ‘ you might read that men should barely notice a baby and step over it and not see any of them but it ’s not true			0
‘ there is a specialised processing in men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that both genders would be responding to these cues			0
‘ the study was in people who were not parents , have no particular experience of looking after babies and yet they are all responding at 100ms to these particular sounds , so this might be a fundamental response present in all of us regardless of parental status			0
’ fellow researcher @entity92 said it may take a bit longer for someone to recognise their own child ’s cries because they need to do more ‘ fine - grained analysis ’			0
the team had previously found that our reactions speed up when we hear a baby crying			2
adults performed better on an arcade game requiring speed , accuracy and dexterity when they were played the sound of a baby crying than after they heard recordings of adults crying or high - pitched birdsong			2
the findings could help shed light on post-natal depression – where mothers struggle to bond with their newborn – by showing how a healthy brain responds to a baby ’s cries			0
the researchers found the sound of a crying baby was triggered within 100 milliseconds of hearing it			1

researchers find the cry of a baby triggers emotional responses in the brain *unlike* any other sound - even in *non-parents*
@entity38 team found cry triggers brain *'s* emotional response in just 100 milliseconds
