researchers at @entity1 in @entity2 are working on a breath test to determine if a driver is under the influence of marijuana			1
the @entity7 reports that law enforcement officers have a test for alcohol , but they do n't have a tool to test for marijuana impairment			1
right now , officers must use blood tests to determine if @entity15 is present in a driver 's blood			1
but @entity1 chemistry professor @entity18 says existing technologies like those used by airport security agents to detect drugs and explosives can be altered to test breath for @entity15			2
new technology : @entity1 are developing a handheld device that police officers would use test drivers for marijuana impairment			1
there is no current such tool for cops conducting traffic stops @entity18 says his team hopes to start testing on humans early next year			0
the @entity37 says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road			0
the issue of stoned drivers has only increased for police since the state legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012			1
the handheld device being developed is not likely to be able to determine how much @entity15 is in a driver 's system			2
the current legal limit is five nanograms of active @entity15 per milliliter of blood			2
however the test will be able to determine whether there is @entity15 present			0
that will be enough for officers to make an arrest of an impaired driver and then do further tests that could be used in court as evidence			0
' we believe at least initially that it would lower the false positives that an officer would have , ' @entity18 told @entity65			0
' they would have a higher level of confidence in making an arrest			0
' a state patrol spokesman said they were excited about the new technology , but would not be willing to implement it until the tests are ' rock solid '			0
under development : tests on the @entity15 technology are due to start at @entity1 ( pictured ) in january			1

@entity1 developing a device that would test drivers for marijuana impairment
officers currently have to use blood tests
the new technology would test positive or *negative* to @entity15
@entity89 legalized recreational marijuana in 2012
