@entity0 is set to add voice calls to its app for the first time in a bid to take on @entity5 and other messaging firms			1
the move is expected to open up major new markets for the firm @entity9 bought for $ 19bn			1
it will allow users of the app to make voice calls to contacts in the same way they would send a message			1
the screens of the feature were recreated by a @entity20 web site from code in the app @entity20 site @entity23 uncovered the screenshots in test code			1
the ' screenshots ' above have been created by @entity29 's @entity28 , who extracted layout files , images , and text from the raw code of the app hosted on @entity0 's website			1
it is expected the feature will work exactly like text or picture messages			1
users will be able to use either their handset or a bluetooth headset to make calls			2
a phone - like page will show calls made an received			2
earlier this month the firm , the firm updated its app to make it harder to avoid @entity0 messages , or at least claim that you have n't seen them			1
the @entity9 - owned app will display two blue ticks in the bottom right - hand corner of an individual message to show that it has been read			1
and clicking on the message will show you the precise time the recipient opened and read it			2
the app update is available across all mobile platforms			1
from now , a single grey tick means the message has been sent , a double grey tick means it has been delivered , and two blue ticks mean it has been read ( pictured ) more information about the features can be found on @entity0 's faq page			2
before the update , there were only two types of tick - a single grey tick meant the message had been successfully sent , and a double grey tick meant it had been delivered			2
now , when a message has been sent , delivered and read , the double grey tick turns blue			2
in a group chat , the second ticks appear when all participants in the group have received the message			2
@entity0 , the global messaging system owned by @entity9 , has begun using a new encryption program aimed at protecting users ' conversations from unwanted surveillance and snooping			1
the messaging service , which has 600 million users , added the new encryption to its last update for @entity92 smartphones , according to @entity93 , the @entity94 - based software group			1
privacy advocates say @entity0 's decision to incorporate so - called ' end - to - end ' encryption will help users communicate without the fear of someone reading their messages			0
@entity0 cofounder @entity102 has said he 's deeply committed to user privacy because he grew up in the @entity104 during the 1980s , when his mother and other adults routinely assumed that authorities eavesdropped on their phone calls			0
the two blue ticks only appear when all participants in the group have read the post			0
to see what time the messages were read users can now press and hold down on a particular post			0
selecting the @entity116 option reveals the time the message was read , and in the case of group messages , what time each member read it			0
@entity0 has rolled out the changes to all variations of its app , across @entity125 , @entity92 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
users need to update the app on their devices to see the changes			1
however , these changes have divided opinion , especially on @entity134			0
some users are concerned the update makes it harder for them to ignore others , and makes it easier for people to keep tabs on them			0
as @ the_baba1 wrote : ' so @entity0 now shows blue ticks to indicate a message has been read			0
now stalk with more vengeance			0
' twitter user @ carpocarp said : ' the @entity0 blue tick is going to ruin friendships , ' while @ archielbar added : ' those blue ticks will be the death of some of us ! ' but not all @entity134 users were concerned about the update - @ tnicole91 explained : ' i do n't get why some people are stressed about this new @entity0 blue tick			0
' for me , if i do n't feel like replying , i just do n't			0
' in a group chat , the blue ticks only appear when all participants have read the @entity162 see what time the messages were read , users can now press and hold down on a particular post and select the @entity116 option			0
in the case of group messages , this reveals what time each individual member read it ( pictured ) @entity0 explained the changes and revealed what the new check marks look like on an official blog post in an official blog post , @entity0 tried to reassure users who may be concerned about why a person had n't received or read their messages			0
' if you only see a single check mark next to your message , there is likely nothing wrong with @entity0 or your phone , ' explained the developers			0
' there may be several reasons why your message has been sent , but not delivered to your chat partner such as their phone might be off , they could be sleeping , especially if they live in a different time zone , they might be experiencing network connection issues or they might have seen the notification on their screen , but did not launch the app - especially common if the recipient uses an @entity200			1
' it is not currently possible to opt out of this feature			0
@entity0 is owned by @entity9 , which has a similar feature on its @entity205 app. when a message is opened and read , a tick appears in the message list and the time it was read appears in the bottom right - hand corner of the post			1
@entity213 's @entity212 also use this feature .			0
