front gunner @entity0 , from @entity1 , was on the way back from a raid with @entity4 over @entity5 on september 7 , 1941 when he was shot down and captured by the @entity7 a man who was fascinated with his grandfather 's plane crash behind enemy lines during the @entity12 has tracked down the wreckage in a forest in @entity15 after years of research			1
front gunner @entity0 , from @entity1 , was on a raid over @entity5 on september 7 , 1941 - one of the most dangerous missions for @entity4			1
returning from the @entity22 capital , the @entity20 plane he was flying in was badly damaged by flak and then attacked by a night fighter			2
with the starboard outer engine in flames and the wing badly damaged , pilot @entity25 gave the order to bail out of the stricken plane			2
@entity0 , who was 20 at the time but had already flown in 13 missions in @entity34 bombers , and the rest of the crew made a lucky escape , but were soon captured and put in prison camps			1
@entity0 's grandson , @entity39 , has been fascinated with the story since childhood			1
in 2008 , 20 years after his grandfather 's death , he decided to track down the crash site			1
the 32 - year - old said : ' i had been lucky enough to make contact with @entity25 's daughter @entity48 on the internet			0
' sadly , both of our relations had passed away , so i felt it my duty to locate the spot in @entity15 where the @entity20 bomber crashed that fateful night			1
' that night @entity25 gave the order to bail out into the unknown , and the story goes that my grandfather helped him put on his parachute			0
' the crew survived the jump and landed in a forest but local security captured them and they were marched into prison camps for the rest of the war			1
' mr @entity0 's research suggested @entity69 , a city in western @entity15 , could be the location of the doomed @entity20 's final resting place			1
he wrote to the local newspaper and contacted the town archive to see if anyone had any information			0
' i had numerous replies from eyewitnesses from 1941 , ' he said			2
' some of them gave me an exact road name where the bomber came down			2
this made me delve deeper into the web of information i had unearthed			0
in 2008 , his grandson @entity39 decided to track down the wreckage of where the plane crashed , finding large chunks of the bomber @entity0 and his five crew members bailed out of the @entity20 bomber ( file picture ) after it suffered damage from flak and a night fighter after help from town archivist @entity106 , mr @entity0 contacted @entity107 , the head of a search group for missing @entity12 airmen , which scours @entity15 and recovers remains for a proper funeral			1
in the end , the precise location of the crash site was only pinpointed by chance when @entity117 , a member of the search group , spoke to a young boy passing on his bicycle , who just happened to know where the wreckage was			2
mr @entity0 said : ' a whole host of wreck parts , from bullet cases , aluminium parts , flexi glass and cockpit fragments , were lying on the floor			1
' one of the most notable finds was a pressure gauge from the pilot dash board			0
all had the @entity34 markings and maker 's stamps on			0
' mr @entity0 flew out to @entity15 this summer with his father , @entity138 , and @entity139			1
after working out where the plane had come to rest , @entity39 ( left ) travelled to @entity15 with ( from l - r ) @entity139 , pilot @entity25 's daughter , crash site locator @entity144 and his father @entity146 a plaque stands at the crash site in a forest outside the city of @entity151 , western @entity15 he said : ' it was an awe - inspiring visit			1
it signified the start of a journey that would change my grandfather for the rest of his life			0
' he would suffer harsh winters , lack of food as a prisoner of war and never quite know if he would ever make it home			0
' i later sent a plaque to @entity15 and it was recently erected at the crash site by @entity107 and @entity117 at their own cost			1
i ca n't thank them enough			0
' he added : ' on that visit to @entity15 i felt i was the closest i had ever been to him since he passed			1
' @entity0 was eventually repatriated and married @entity173 , mr @entity0 's grandmother , in 1946			1
they went on to have three sons , @entity138 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
mr @entity0 added : ' he never spoke about the war nor did he go to the reunions			2
' i think the things he witnessed he wanted to forget and move on with his life			0
' my grandfather was one of the lucky ones in certain respects , but had to endure the harshness of being a prisoner at such a young age and live with this for the rest of his life			0
' mr @entity0 is now trying to track down the family of crew members flight officer @entity192 , sgt @entity193 , and sgt @entity194			1
he has already contacted the family of fellow crew member sgt @entity196 , and sgt @entity197 , who is still alive and living in @entity198			0
anyone with information can email mr @entity0 at ian - davenport@hotmail.com @entity202 's role during the @entity12 was to bomb the enemy 's airbases , shipping , troops , communications and other industries connected to the @entity22 war effort			1
@entity210 had to use long - range bombing after @entity212 in 1940 until d - day in 1944 as it had no other way of attacking the @entity22			0
the job fell to @entity34 air crews - some of who were just 18 - who flew increasingly heavier types of long - range bombers			0
it was so successful that @entity223 was forced to divert nearly a million men , 55,000 artillery guns and a large part of the @entity22 air force on to defending the nation instead of fighting offensively			0
@entity4 flew almost every day and mostly at night during the war to avoid being shot down - but this meant it was difficult to locate small targets			1
in 1941 it was decided whole industrial cities should be priority targets			2
larger four - engine bombers and improved navigation equipment then followed to create a formidable fighting force			0
the repeated and persistent attacks on @entity22 cities which followed became a critical factor in the liberation of @entity242 and the defeat of @entity15 in 1945			2
@entity4 's targeting of large industrial areas was considered controversial by many , with firebombing killed tens of thousands of civilians in @entity248 in just two days			2
working class housing areas were targeted because they had a higher density and firestorms were more likely			0
this disrupted the @entity22 workforce and the @entity22 capability of producing more weapons			0
the plan was highly controversial even before it started , but the @entity257 thought bombing was the only option available to attack @entity15 directly as a major invasion of the continent was years away			1
the tactic has been strongly criticised leading to accusations of war crimes .			0

@entity0 was a front gunner for @entity4 during @entity12
his plane was shot down after raid over @entity5 in 1941 , but the crew survived
they bailed out of the plane but were soon caught by the @entity7
in 2008 , 20 years after his death , his grandson decided to find the wreckage
@entity39 spent six years working out the final fate of the bomber
*amazingly* the wreckage was found in a dense forest in western @entity15
