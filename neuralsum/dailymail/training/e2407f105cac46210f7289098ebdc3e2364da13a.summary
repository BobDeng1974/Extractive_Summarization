by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 28 june 2013 updated : 04:47 est , 28 june 2013 family chats are becoming a thing of the past as the majority of parents now communicate regularly with their children through social network sites , according to a new report out today			1
a staggering seven in ten parents have admitted to now using social sites such as @entity11 and @entity12 as a regular channel of communication in their family			1
and more than one in ten admit they did n’t have meaningful chats in person with their children at all throughout a typical week			1
tech family : a staggering seven in ten parents have admitted to now using social sites such as @entity11 and @entity12 as a regular channel of communication in their familyis it has been revealed that the average @entity25 has just six face - to - face conversations with others in their family each week – that 's less than one a day			1
instead , we send five emails on an average week , post on walls three times a week and comment on photos twice a week via social networking sites			2
furthermore , over a third of parents claim to rely heavily on other social websites such as @entity38 and @entity39 to really understand what makes their child tick			1
an overwhelming 62 per cent of those parents quizzed revealed that they checked what their children were ' liking ' or ' wanting to be seen in ' at least once a day			2
80 per cent of those parents who keep an eye on things that their child has shown an interest in online - whether it ’s a hobby or an item of clothing or a place to go to - say it has significantly helped their relationship with their child			2
however , nearly all ( 98 per cent ) admitted to not really wanting to be ' friends ' with or ' followers ' of their children , but felt that they needed to as this was the only way they would get the quickest response			0
prying eyes : over a third of parents claim to rely heavily on other social websites such as @entity38 and @entity39 to really understand what makes their child tick @entity68 , co-founder of @entity69 / , who carried out the research , said : ' it ’s definitely a sign of the times that parents are using social tools as the main way to communicate with and understand their children			1
' who would have thought ten years ago that the web would play such a big part in a family ’s everyday life ? ' our research clearly shows that it ’s these technically adept parents who are the smart ones as they ’ve realised that children can hide the majority of content in their @entity11 feed from them so their “ friendship ” with their child can be meaningless			2
' instead they have turned to things like @entity38 to understand what their children are really about			0
' professor @entity95 , psychologist at @entity96 added : ' as children develop and are able to spend more time away from their parents it leaves mothers and fathers ignorant of what their children are doing , and also feeling they know them less well			0
' this survey reminds us that it is vital that parents keep up with technology and become familiar with the social tools used by the younger generation			0
this way the tech savvy parents will be better able to keep tabs on their children			0
' by being able to see what their child likes and dislikes online they may also gain better insight into their child 's behaviour			0
this will not only enhance the parent - child relationship but may also help ensure child safety on - line			0
' although face - to - face communication is important for healthy family functioning , we also all have to accept that we live in a digital age and need to adapt to new ways of interacting			1
' catching their attention : nearly all parents admitted to not really wanting to be ' friends ' with their children online , but felt that they needed to as this was the only way they would get the quickest response			0
