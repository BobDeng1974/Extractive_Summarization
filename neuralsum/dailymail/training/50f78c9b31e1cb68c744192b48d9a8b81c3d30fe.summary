@entity0 are this season ’s ‘ crisis club ’ and manager @entity2 is already clinging to his job with the campaign just six games old			1
a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity7 on monday night has reopened the debate over his future – not that the subject was ever closed – and leaves the @entity13 joint bottom of the @entity14			1
indeed , they have collected just 19 points from a possible 81 since @entity17			0
owner @entity18 , however , is set to keep faith with the 53 - year - old in the short term and a trip to @entity23 is next up on saturday			1
but there is very definitely trouble in @entity27 right now			2
here , @entity28 looks at 10 contributing factors to their peril … @entity0 fans show their frustration with the current regime during the @entity14 clash with @entity7 @entity35 scores @entity7 's winner to continue @entity0 's winless run that leaves them bottom of the table midfielder @entity41 looks dejected after @entity0 fall to another league defeat @entity2 – the manager has been in charge for four years , enjoying good times and bad			1
do n’t forget , he was @entity14 and @entity46 in 2012 and there was talk of admiring eyes being cast from the @entity50			2
but sometimes a tenure simply runs its course and there is a definite feel of that with @entity2 and @entity0			2
supporters have , at times , accepted the boss , but very few have taken fondly to him			0
a change for both parties seems like the sensible solution right now			0
no ambition – @entity18 ’s wish is to renew the club ’s top - flight status season on season , thus lining the coffers			1
there is no desire to follow the model of a club such as @entity73 and , with similar resources , make a bid to break the top four			0
manager @entity2 appears to have run his course on @entity78 after a dismal run of results owner @entity18 manages to applaud after watching another drab defeat at the @entity82 when they did finish fifth in 2012 , @entity0 ’s subsequent involvement in the @entity84 was viewed as an inconvenience and the season almost finished in relegation – and @entity18 does not want that			1
hence , then , the policy of deprioritising the domestic cup competitions , something which has angered supporters starved of silverware since 1969			0
poor relations – the club have banned three local newspapers and several national titles are also barred from @entity99			1
@entity100 , therefore , are strained to say the least and this has eroded any notion of ‘ good will ’ towards the club , something which is particularly important from your local papers in times of trouble			2
fan frustration – the @entity0 will never accept @entity18 and , as long as he remains in ownership , unrest will always lurk beneath the surface , even in good times , should they ever return			1
they , like all football fans , want to be sold a dream , a vision , a reason for putting down £ 50 every fortnight			0
sadly , romance is dead on @entity78 and fans love nothing more than to hate the regime right now			0
@entity0 fans unfurl a banner in protest of @entity18 's ownership of the club @entity129 core is no more – when @entity0 won promotion back to the @entity14 and then re-established themselves as a top - flight outfit – first under @entity134 and then @entity2 – they did so with an @entity129 blue - chip brigade			1
@entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 were the standard bearers and kept affairs on and off the pitch in check			0
none of those players remain at the club and have instead been replaced by foreign imports who see @entity0 as a stepping stone to bigger things – @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 are four who have used @entity78 as a launch pad			1
poor signings – ‘ super scout ’ @entity161 can point to some fine discoveries on the continent , but this summer ’s soccermarket sweep is yet to bear fruit			0
@entity166 has looked more like a 12 - year - old on a playground than a £ 12million playmaker on a @entity14 pitch			1
@entity0 have lost their @entity129 spine of players like @entity140 ( c ) and @entity141 ( r ) new signing @entity174 is yet to score a @entity14 goal for the @entity13 in six attempts striker @entity174 – a £ 6m addition from @entity179 – is yet to score in the league and was hooked at half - time against @entity7			1
at least @entity174 has been judged good enough to start , which is more than can be said for fellow frontmen @entity184 and @entity185 , a pair of unknowns who remain a mystery			2
no goals – @entity0 have drawn a blank in four of six league games this season and failed to score in 13 from 20 at the back end of the last campaign			1
the club have known since may that a goalscorer was needed to replace @entity154 , yet no - one with any @entity14 pedigree has arrived			1
@entity198 – scorer of two against @entity199 – offers a glimmer of hope , but he was horribly out of form last season and netted just twice in the league			0
@entity206 international defender @entity205 ( r ) struggles to keep @entity207 at bay no case for defence – on paper , @entity0 ’s back five makes for assured reading – @entity206 internationals @entity214 and @entity205 , skipper @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity219 lad @entity218			2
on grass , however , they are a constant source of worry for @entity2 and supporters			1
opposition teams rarely have to work hard for a score against @entity0 and they have shipped 12 from six in the league this season			0
injuries hurt – injuries , of course , happen – that is why squads are built and allowance made for cover			0
@entity0 , though , do not have the depth to absorb loss in key positions			0
@entity240 captain @entity239 had looked the most promising of the summer signings until a torn thigh muscle ruled him out until @entity243			0
@entity0 have been denied the services of promising @entity239 ( c ) through injury @entity246 are the only top seven side to play @entity0 , yet @entity13 have collected just three points and it says a lot when a hamstring injury suffered by 18 - year - old @entity251 – who is yet to start a league game – is described by @entity2 as a ‘ major blow ’			1
playing catch - up – the @entity14 fixture list was kind to @entity0 , opening against champions @entity246 apart			2
but subsequent home games against @entity259 and @entity199 – as well as trips to @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity7 – have produced just three points			2
those games are gone now , you do n’t get them back			0
that means away matches at last season ’s top seven still lie in wait , while all of the big boys – other than @entity246 – are yet to visit @entity78 .			0

*newcastle* are joint bottom of @entity14 after their 1 - 0 loss to @entity7
@entity2 is clinging to his job amid *massive* unrest from supporters
owner @entity18 seems *satisfied* with merely *avoiding* relegation
the @entity13 have banned local newspapers from their ground
@entity129 players have been replaced by foreign imports as a stepping stone
@entity27 have failed to score in four of seven games with new striker @entity174 yet to open his account in the league
injuries have hit important players , *including* new signing @entity239
a defence featuring several internationals is not living up to *expectations*
