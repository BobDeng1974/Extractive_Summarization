poverty affects the intelligence of children as young as two , a study has found - and its impact increases as the child ages			1
deprived young children were found to have iq scores six points lower , on average , than children from wealthier families			1
and the gap got wider throughout childhood , with the early difference tripling by the time the children reached adolescence			1

a stock image of children on a condemned estate in @entity25 are show scientists from @entity28 , @entity29 compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents as part of the @entity34 ( teds )			1
the study is an on - going investigation socio - economic and genetic links to intelligence			1
children were assessed nine times between the ages of two and 16 , using a mixture of parent - administered , web and telephone - based tests			0
technology may be getting smarter , but humans are getting dumber , scientists have warned			0
evidence suggests that the @entity50 of people in the @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 have declined in the last decade			0
opinion is divided as to whether the trend is long - term , but some researchers believe that humans have already reached intellectual peak			0
an iq test used to determine whether @entity53 men are fit to serve in the military has revealed scores have fallen by 1.5 points since 1998			2
and standard tests issued in the @entity52 and @entity54 echo the results , according to journalist @entity67 , writing in @entity68			0
the results , published in the journal @entity71 , revealed that children from wealthier backgrounds with more opportunities scored higher in iq tests at the age of two , and experienced greater iq gains over time			2
dr @entity78 , from @entity28 , who led the study , said : ' we ’ve known for some time that children from low socioeconomic status ( @entity85 ) backgrounds perform on average worse on intelligence tests than children from higher @entity85 backgrounds , but the developmental relationship between intelligence and @entity85 had not been previously shown			2
' our research establishes that relationship , highlighting the link between @entity85 and @entity93			0
' we hope that our findings will drive future research into the specific mechanisms and factors that underpin the link between @entity85 and @entity93 and thus , contribute to widening the iq gap			0
' last year , a study by the @entity100 revealed that children from poor backgrounds and one - parent families are more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , which could affect their ability to excel at school			2
researchers found a link between social and economic status and childhood adhd in @entity52 by analysing data from the @entity111 - a database of more than 19,500 @entity52 children born between 2000 and 2002			1
while young children were found to have iq scores on average six points lower than their wealthier peers , the intelligence gap was found to triple by the time they reached adolescence , which means their background arguably puts them at a disadvantage in exams such as @entity127			1
a stock image is shown the study , published in the @entity130 , showed that there was a greater prevalence of @entity109 among children from families living below the poverty line			0
the researchers found the average family income for a household with a child affected by @entity109 was £ 324 ( $ 509 ) per week , compared to £ 391 ( $ 614 ) for those with unaffected children			2
they also revealed that the chance of parents in social housing having a child with @entity109 was roughly three times greater than for those who owned their own homes			0
mothers with no qualifications were more than twice as likely to have a child with @entity109 as those with degrees , and lone parents were more likely to have a child with @entity109 than households with two live - in parents .			0

scientists compared data on almost 15,000 children and their parents
the research was part of the @entity34 ( teds )
study aims to study socio - economic and genetic links with intelligence
deprived young children were found to have iq scores six points lower , on average , than children from wealthier families
and this gap widens throughout childhood , with the early different tripling by the time the child reaches adolescence
