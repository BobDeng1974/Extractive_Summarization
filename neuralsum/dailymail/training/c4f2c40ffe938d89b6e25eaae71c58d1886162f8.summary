new @entity1 chief executive @entity0 wants to stop customers deserting for discounters @entity3 and @entity5 top executives at @entity1 have been forced to shop and cook like housewives as part of a plan to put them back in touch with their customers			1
the bosses were sent food shopping at @entity1 and at all its main rivals then whisked away to a small , remote holiday cottage in @entity18			2
the plan was the brainchild of @entity0 , who took over the chief executive job at @entity1 last month , in an effort to encourage his 15 most senior executives to see the business from the point of view of ordinary shoppers			1
he arrived seven weeks ago only to be faced with a massive profits slide at the company and a shock accounting scandal that has rocked the stock market and seen @entity1 shares slump			2
but he wants to quickly find ways to stop customers deserting for @entity34 discounters @entity5 and @entity3 and to sweep away a culture at @entity1 that included operating six corporate jets			1
he is already close to selling two of them			2
mr @entity0 told @entity39 : ‘ i think if you ’re in our business and you ’re not spending all of your time looking at the quality and the presentation and the taste of the food and the products you serve – what are you doing ? ’ ‘ i took my executive team away for a day and a night			1
it ’s been a very frenetic time and i wanted to get to know the people and talk about where the business was and where it was heading			0
‘ so i took them off to a tiny self - catering place in @entity18			0
‘ let ’s just say it was a damn sight cheaper than most hotels would cost you			0
apart from discussing strategies , they also prepared meals			0
‘ i said to them , “ you two get breakfast for the group , you do lunch and we ’ll do dinner			0
” ‘ the meals had to come from @entity1 and the competition so we as an exec group had a hands - on experience of going shopping , buying , preparing , eating and we sat and we looked through it all			0
’ mr @entity0 also wants thousands of head office staff to spend one day a fortnight in stores over @entity94 as another part of his overhaul of company culture , mr @entity0 wants thousands of staff at the head office in @entity100 , @entity101 , to spend one day a fortnight in stores in the run - up to @entity94			1
he explained : ‘ i ’m trying to get the business to make time for and think about – if they were n’t doing already – the things that matter from a customer point of view ... service , availability , quality			1
