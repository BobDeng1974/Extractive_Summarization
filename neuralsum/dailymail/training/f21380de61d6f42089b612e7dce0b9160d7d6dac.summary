@entity0 gained a small measure of revenge for last month 's @entity4 defeat by knocking @entity6 hero @entity5 out of the @entity7 on friday			1
and another key member of the victory at @entity10 also fell by the wayside at @entity12 as defending champion @entity13 suffered his second successive defeat			1
@entity13 lost by two holes to @entity18 's @entity17 to miss out on the knockout stages for the first time in four appearances in the event , the @entity15 having reached the quarter - finals in 2011 , the final in 2012 and winning last year in @entity25			1
@entity5 was brought back down to earth with a bump by @entity0 after his @entity4 heroics @entity29 @entity4 star @entity0 enjoyed his day at the @entity12 on friday afternoon 11.40am : @entity0 vs @entity30 11.55 : @entity32 vs @entity31 12.10 : @entity17 vs @entity33 12.25 : @entity35 vs @entity34 @entity37 's @entity36 had already been eliminated after losing his first two matches , leaving @entity32 and @entity35 to fly the flag for the victorious @entity6 team this weekend			1
@entity35 and @entity0 will enjoy a re-match of their @entity4 singles clash in the semi-finals if they can see off @entity34 and @entity30 respectively in the last eight , with @entity32 taking on @entity31 and @entity17 facing @entity33 in the other quarter - finals			1
' @entity35 will have revenge on his mind but i will too , ' said @entity0 , who beat @entity35 on the 18th at @entity10 to finish as the top @entity29 points scorer on his debut			1
' i might have the ' w ' in the singles but he has the cup and i do n't			0
' @entity5 , who secured the winning point against @entity54 to make it three wins from four matches on his debut was never ahead against @entity0 , who carded six birdies but was also crucially gifted the 11th when @entity5 three - putted from close range			2
birdies on the 12th and 14th took @entity0 four ahead with four to play and although @entity5 kept the match alive by almost holing his second shot to the par - five 15th and hitting his tee shot to two feet on the next , @entity0 also made birdie on the 16th to seal the win			2
@entity0 hit the headlines at the @entity4 for signalling to the @entity6 fans to keep quiet when he made crucial putts , but admitted he expected more banter with the crowds this week			2
@entity32 plays his shot from the fairway on the 15th hole during day three of the @entity73 @entity34 of @entity74 hits a shot on the first hole of his play - off against @entity78 at the @entity12 @entity17 chips out of the rough on the 13th during his match against @entity13 @entity32 and @entity36 on the eighth green at the @entity7 @entity7 ' i had a couple of shushes on eight the par three , ' he said			1
' if i had made the putt i would have turned round to do it back and try to get them going but unfortunately i missed it ! ' i thought i would have heard more because it was the first time i was playing a guy on the @entity4 team since the @entity4 but the fans loved the golf we were playing			2
' the best golf of the day came in the match between @entity34 and @entity96 's @entity78 , who both finished 10 under par and went into a sudden - death play - off to decide who finished second to @entity0 in their group			1
a par at the first extra hole was enough for @entity34 to advance after @entity78 's approach found water guarding the green			2
@entity13 was ' only ' three under in losing to @entity17 , who birdied three of the last four holes to become the only player to win all three of his group matches			2
@entity4 star @entity35 sealed his progress into a quarter - final against fellow @entity113 @entity13 plays from deep rough into the 18th green during his defeat by @entity17 ' a bit like yesterday , i ran into a guy on form , ' said @entity13 , who was three up after eight holes			1
' i thought i had the match in control but the putter abandoned me at the 11th hour			0
i just kind of used my putts up against @entity126 ( @entity127 ) on wednesday			0
' i 'm very disappointed by my defence of the title but there was a lot of quality golf out there			0
if you 're not shooting 64 or 65 you 're going home			0
but i hit the ball beautifully with a new set of irons and a new ball in the bag this week and i ca n't wait to get to @entity141 now			0
i 'm in the mood to get on a plane now to @entity141 , so bring it on			0
' @entity35 made sure of his place in the quarter - finals in style by holing his second shot to the 17th to beat 2013 runner - up @entity150 2 & 1 , while @entity30 advanced despite losing by the same score to the already - eliminated @entity153			1
after 10 straight singles defeats @entity36 defeated @entity155 & 1 in their dead rubber , while @entity33 - who chipped in on the 18th to beat @entity36 on thursday - defeated @entity158 's @entity157 by the same score			0
' i feel i just need to work a wee bit on my game , ' @entity36 said			0
' i 'm not far away			0
i came here working on something anyway and i 'll just keep chipping away and see what happens for the last four or five tournaments of the year			0
