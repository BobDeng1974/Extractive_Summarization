@entity0 does not believe @entity1 should beat themselves up after only defeating minnows @entity3 5 - 0 on thursday night			1

when asked if @entity16 's side should have scored more goals , @entity0 told @entity18 : ' the main thing was that we got the three points			1
@entity0 defended @entity1 's scoreline after they only put five goals past @entity24 ' we 're hoping not to win the group on goal difference , we 're hoping to win it by two or three points , so two , three , four , five tonight does n't really matter that much			1
' the manager has always shown faith in me and although it was only against @entity3 it was nice to come on and get my goal and repay the manager 's faith			1
' @entity37 , who was named man of the match , hailed the professional performance from the @entity1			1
the @entity42 winger said points , not goals , are the most important factor in qualification he said : ' we have done what we had to do			1
we knew we were going into a game that we were going to win			0
it was just a matter of keeping our concentration			0
' we knew it could take 20 - 25 minutes ( to score )			2

' in the first half of these games when a fit and healthy team is getting 10 men behind the ball , that is the time you have to wear them down and keep plugging away and keep doing the right things and know if you keep doing that and score one or two goals , in the second half it is going to open up and there will be chances for lots and lots of goals			0
