death toll reaches 37 after city battered by heaviest downpour in 60 years disaster has affected 1.9 million and is estimated to have caused almost one billion pounds worth of damages the torrential rain saw roads submerged and caused blackouts across @entity8 residents took to the internet to express their anger over the city 's ' flawed ' infrastructure by @entity14 published : 11:41 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 11:41 est , 23 july 2012 a devastating rainstorm that claimed 37 lives in @entity8 over the weekend has raised serious concerns over the @entity20 capital 's ability to cope with flooding			1
@entity8 was hit with the heaviest downpour seen in the city in 60 years on saturday , with many roads submerged under waist - deep water for hours			1
the death toll had reached 37 by sunday night according to the municipal government , after 25 people drowned , six were killed in cave - ins in houses , five were electrocuted and one was killed by lightening			1
deluge : non-stop rain saw roads turned into rivers in the city , with parts submerged in up to 17 feet of water chaos : cars can be seen floating in floodwaters surrounding a residential building in @entity8 , following fierce rainstorms over the weekend record rainfall : two men watch as emergency services try to retrieve a damaged bus left submerged in a flooded car park after storms hit @entity8 at the weekend , leaving 37 people dead disaster : cars remain partially submerged in rainwater in the aftermath of heavy storms that hit @entity8 , @entity20 at the weekend the rain and flooding caused blackouts and road closures across the city			1
the @entity8 - @entity62 - @entity61 was still yet to reopen on monday as part of it remained submerged			2
the disaster affected 1.9 million people and caused almost 10 billion yuan ( almost Â£ 1 billion ) of damages , according to state news agency @entity68			1
the exact economic loss is still being verified by local governmental departments , according to @entity8 flood control and drought relief headquarters			2
government officials faced criticism as local people took to the internet to criticise the city 's inadequate drainage systems			1
' the situation of the sewers reflects the real quality of the city 's infrastructure , ' one user called brother @entity80 posted on popular micro-blogging site @entity87			1
another going by the name of ' @entity90 ' wrote : ' @entity20 has been investing heavily in construction in recent years , and the glossy appearance of the cities is eye - catching			0
' however , the huge loss from the rainstorm in @entity8 has exposed the flaws of the city 's infrastructure , which should raise an alarm for the policy makers			1
' wreckage : flash floods receded to reveal cars left piled up in a ditch in @entity104 in @entity8 at the weekend devastation : the rain and flooding in @entity8 is estimated to have caused around one billion pounds worth of damages swept away : a vehicle washed away by flooding in @entity104 in @entity8 can be glimpsed still partially submerged in the muddy rainwater bereft : a @entity8 family try and salvage their belongings from their damaged home after a storm wreaked havoc in the city at the weekend scenes such as those witnessed in @entity8 across the weekend are becoming an all too familiar sight in @entity20 this summer , with rainstorms and flooding wreaking havoc in cities including @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			1
experts believe the floods are largely down to urbanisation , with vast networks of roads and the elimination of greenbelts reducing some cities ' ability to cope with heavy rainfall			0
@entity141 , from the @entity142 , said more than 80 per cent of @entity8 's roads are covered in impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt - which prevent the infiltration of rain water			2
but an investigation led by @entity150 , a professor at the @entity151 , about half of the city 's drainage networks are filled with sediments - with some layers as thick as ten to 15 per cent of the pipes ' diameter			2
urban flooding : @entity20 's flooding problems are not limited to @entity8 - this picture shows waterlogged streets in @entity164 township in @entity166 district in @entity167 , in southwest @entity20 's @entity168 at the weekend submerged : this picture taken in @entity129 in southwest @entity20 over the weekend shows people wading along a flooded street @entity173 , an engineer at the @entity174 , said the mass construction of tall buildings and underground parking lots in some @entity20 cities had also slowed the rate at which rainwater is absorbed into the ground			2
@entity182 , from @entity8 's flood control and drought relief headquarters , said the drainage systems in the city 's downtown area are for the most part build to withstand rainfall of between 36 and 45 millimetres per hour			1
only a few places , such as @entity191 , have a more robust system that can withstand 56 millimetres of rainfall per hour			0
@entity194 , an environmental and engineering professor at @entity196 , said the flooding would not be so severe if drainage systems were designed to handle more severe rainfalls , adding that the flooding could be avoided if regulations governing urban drainage took population growth , water usage and sewage treatment into consideration			0
@entity207 , an engineer at the @entity208 , said storm drainage systems are supposed to be designed in accordance with the @entity211 approved by the @entity212 in 2000			0
a central government group responsible for drafting regulations related to urban drainage engineering gathered on may 18 to discuss the problem of urban flooding			0
new regulations are expected to be launched next year , according to a source with the group			0
but experts have pointed out that the reconstruction of the drainage systems would be a very expensive and difficult undertaking			0
since the lay - out and the functional structure of the cities are already in shape , renewing the drainage systems to bring them up to the level of developed countries would be hugely costly , according to @entity141 at the @entity142			0
experts have urged the government to launch a uniform urban flooding drainage standard to guide the urban planning of @entity20 cities , @entity68 said .			0
