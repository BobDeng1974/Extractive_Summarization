as they were n’t uncovered in a funeral context , as is the case with other quipus , researchers believe that these may have been used for administrative purposes , according to a report in @entity33			0

a quipu has one main cord , called a primary cord , from which a number of other pendant cords hang the @entity13 stretched from @entity51 through central @entity52 , with its centre in @entity54 , a city in the southern @entity55			2
the @entity13 called their empire @entity13 , the ' land of the @entity58 , ' and its official language was @entity60			2

despite their short rule , they controlled more than 12 million from 100 different cultures and speaking at least 20 languages			0
to support this empire , a system of roads stretched for almost 25,000 miles ( 40,000 km ) , which is around three times the diameter of the @entity69			0
while the @entity13 did not develop a formal system of writing , they did use devices such as the quipu			2
researchers today are unable to read them , but they believe they would have been used for creating records such as a census			2
attached to these pendant cords are up to 12 additional cords , which are called subsidiaries			0
each quipu cord may have several knots , which researchers believe the @entity13 empire used as a decimal system of counting			2
the knot type , researchers believe , may indicate the magnitude of a number in units of one , 10 , 100 or more			0
their positions and colours likely revealed what was being counted such as gold , corn , or other products			0
