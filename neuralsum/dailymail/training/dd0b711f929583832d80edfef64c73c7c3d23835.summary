by @entity1 reporter published : 14:15 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 17:23 est , 28 august 2013 ' totally unacceptable ' : justice secretary @entity2 said it was ' clear ' that actions taken @entity6 staff needed to be investigated by police a private security company faces a police investigation after the government uncovered potentially fraudulent behaviour in its multimillion pound prison escorting contract			1
@entity6 employees allegedly recorded prisoners as having been delivered ready for court when in fact they were not , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) said			1
the figures are a key performance measure for the £ 285million contract			2
the contract , which covers prison transfer services in @entity24 and @entity25 , has been put under administrative supervision with immediate effect			1
justice secretary @entity2 said : ' it ’s become very clear there has been a culture within parts of @entity6 that has been totally unacceptable , and actions which need to be investigated by the police			1
' we have not seen evidence of systemic malpractice up to board level , but we have been clear with the company - unless it undertakes a rapid process of major change , and becomes completely open with @entity10 about the work it is doing for us , then it will not win public contracts in future			0
' the taxpayer must know that their money is being properly used			0
' both the @entity14 and @entity6 ’s directors have asked @entity24 police to investigate the actions of the staff working on the prison escorting contract			1
the government department said differences between @entity6 ’s records of contract performance and the actual situation on the ground has been subject to investigation for some months			1
a @entity6 security van : @entity6 employees allegedly recorded prisoners as having been delivered ready for court when they were not			1
the figures are a key performance measure for a £ 285million contract evidence of potentially fraudulent behaviour emerged as part of the audit work announced by mr @entity2 in july in the wake of an electronic tagging scandal , in which @entity74 and @entity6 were both accused of overcharging the government for monitoring offenders			1
the time at which prisoners are made available for legal visits , prior to being delivered to the courtroom dock , is a key measure of @entity6 ’s performance on the contract , the @entity14 said			1
the latest investigation into @entity6 comes in the wake of allegations that taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘ phantom ’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead , in jail or had left the country			1
the private security firm and its industry rival @entity74 are both accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which had either been removed or simply never fitted			1
estimates suggest up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the @entity14 was billed for every day were not real			0
justice secretary @entity2 in july took the dramatic step after pledging to recover ‘ every last penny ’ owed to the public purse as he asked fraud investigators to prove the scandal			1
he told mps the scandal could date back as far as 1999 , when tagging of criminals began in @entity107 and @entity108			2
since then the taxpayer has spent £ 1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders			2
the current contracts began in 2005			0
mr @entity2 at the time condemned the overcharging as ‘ wholly indefensible and unacceptable ’			0
in some cases , bills were paid for months or years after tags were taken off , he said			0
the process of getting a prisoner from the prison van to the point where they are ready for legal visits can be lengthy , as they have to go through comprehensive security checks and processing			2
the audit findings suggest some @entity6 staff have been manipulating their performance figures			2
in light of the new findings , @entity6 have agreed to repay all past profits made on the prison escorting contract and to forgo any future profits			1
the @entity136 giant has told the @entity14 that no member of the board had knowledge of the allegedly fraudulent practice			2
the annual contract value is £ 40.7 million , with the current projected contract value over seven years at £ 285 million			0
@entity143 , chief executive of @entity6 , said : ' the justice secretary is right to expect the highest standards of performance from @entity6			2
' i am deeply saddened and appalled at the misreporting of data by a small number of employees on the contract			0
' this is a very serious matter for the customer and for us			0
we will not tolerate any wrongdoing and that is why we have referred this matter to the police			0
' it is also why i have immediately initiated a programme of change and corporate renewal			0
' the overwhelming majority of our people work hard every day to deliver important public services and will share my deep concern about this matter			0
' @entity167 , director of the @entity168 , said : ' everyone wants to see proper rehabilitation but , if the ' rehabilitation revolution ' means handing shed loads of money to apparently untrustworthy private companies , it will be a disaster for the taxpayer and for the criminal justice system			0
' it 's not too late for the @entity14 to deliver rehabilitation reform by driving up standards and building on best practice in probation , prison and voluntary services			0
