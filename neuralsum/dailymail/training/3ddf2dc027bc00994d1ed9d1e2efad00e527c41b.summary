by @entity0 a row over hi - tech experts under new @entity4 - related sanctions has sparked a major row over the @entity6			1
extensive cooperation in space between @entity9 and @entity10 came under renewed pressure after the @entity12 banned high - tech exports to @entity14			1
@entity14 pledged tit - for - tat measures in revenge for @entity12 sanctions it said would hit its space industry , a symbol of national pride and a sphere of fierce competition with the @entity12 dating back to the @entity24			1
two @entity12 astronauts are currently aboard the station - @entity32 , flight engineer and astronaut @entity33			1
@entity33 has already begun to pack cargo and personal supplies for his return to @entity37			0
the home - bound crew will enter their @entity41 spacecraft for a 3.5 hour trip home next month			0
@entity32 is set to return at a later date			0
a deputy prime minister suggested that @entity12 astronauts , who depend on @entity14 rockets to get to the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , use trampolines to reach it instead			1
however , analysts said @entity10 was unlikely to curb its shuttle service to the @entity6 , for which @entity12 space agency @entity28 pays more than $ 60 million per person , as it provided essential financing for the cash - strapped industry			1
the @entity55 said on monday the @entity12 would deny export licences for any high - technology items that could aid @entity14 military capabilities and revoke existing licences			1
' the seriousness of these measures is absolutely obvious for us , ' deputy foreign minister @entity60 told gazeta.ru in an online interview , highlighting high - tech cooperation between the two countries , including launching satellites , either @entity12 - made or containing @entity12 components			1
' all this hits at our high - tech enterprises and industries			0
' deputy prime minister @entity73 , responsible for @entity14 's defence industry and known for @entity76 rhetoric , suggested space may be the next frontier in the standoff over @entity4 , which has taken relations between @entity9 and @entity10 to their worst since the @entity24			1
@entity33 's space selfie , taken while on a recent spacewalk to fix a computer			0
there are now fears his return trip could be cancelled over a sanctions row ' the @entity12 introduced sanctions against our space industry ... we warned them , we will reply to statements with statements , to actions with actions , ' he wrote on @entity96			2
' i propose that the @entity12 delivers its astronauts to the @entity6 with the help of a trampoline , ' he added			1
the @entity12 and the @entity101 were locked in the so - called " space race " for decades			2
@entity14 's @entity103 was the first man in space in 1961 and @entity105 of the @entity12 was the first @entity103 in 1969			1
with the @entity24 over , competition gave way to cooperation			0
while @entity28 was banned earlier this month from contacting the @entity14 government due to sanctions , operation of the space station , a $ 100 billion research project owned by 15 countries , remains exempt			1
@entity33 ( pictured ) also got fellow spacewalker @entity115 to take this picture of him in front of the station 's @entity119 module but @entity121 , director at the @entity123 think - tank in @entity10 , said many other joint space projects would suffer immediately			2
' this is a very sensitive issue since our defence industry was completely unprepared for such developments , ' he said			0
' both sides will suffer but @entity14 will lose out more in terms of technology transfer			2
' ' for us , this cooperation was largely a technology school			0
' analysts said @entity14 still lagged in production of high - tech electronic components - including microchips for satellites - and that meant its space and arms sectors were overwhelmingly reliant on imports from the @entity144			2
@entity146 rocket booster with @entity148 space ship seen prior the launch at the @entity14 leased @entity150 , @entity151			0
depending on the scale and scope of the sanctions , at stake could be up to five commercial satellite launches contracted by foreign clients by the end of this year at the @entity159 , a state - run @entity14 spacecraft maker			2
' we are ready to carry out all the commercial launches we have planned for this year and we hope that will be the case			0
' we have all the necessary permits to that end , ' said @entity166 , the @entity159 's spokesman			0
but in a sign of market concern over the sanctions , shares in @entity169 satellite operator @entity168 fell on tuesday despite the company saying the schedule of satellite launches for its new faster broadband network was not affected .			0
