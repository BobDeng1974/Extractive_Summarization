in the hunt for life elsewhere in the universe , one of the key questions has been how and when other planets formed ; and was @entity6 an early or a late bloomer by comparison ? now astronomers may have an answer , as they have discovered a planet in our own @entity11 that is a staggering 11.2 billion years old - more than twice the age of our solar system			1
more importantly , the planet is an @entity6 - sized world , suggesting planets like our own have been forming long into the history of the universe			1
a team from the @entity22 has found an ancient planetary system containing five planets ( shown at the bottom of the illustration , compared to other planets at the top )			1
the planets are the size of our own , suggesting @entity6 - sized planets - and maybe life - have formed throughout the history of the universe the discovery of the extrasolar system - 117 light - years away in the @entity36 - was made by dr @entity37 , an astronomer from the @entity22			1
with his team , he studied the star called @entity40 ( @entity40 stands for ' @entity41 ' ) , which had been found by the @entity42			2
around the star were five planets , all smaller than @entity6			2
and they were able to estimate that the system is 11.2 billion years old , give or take 900 million years			1
by comparison , our sun is only 4.56 billion years old			2
the astronomers estimated the age of the planets from that of the star			2
by working out the age of the cluster in which a star resides , its age can be estimated			0
the @entity60 questions why have we not found aliens , despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve			2
physicist @entity67 devised it in 1950			0
he believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected			0
he claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent , self - aware , technologically advanced , space - colonising civilisations			0
this barrier is sometimes referred to as a ' @entity80 '			0
the absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct			0
and , as most planets are thought to form early in the life of the planetary system , it has been reasonably assumed they formed at the same time - but there is a sizeable margin of error owing to this method used			1
' that implies that @entity6 - size planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe 's history when metals were more scarce , ' dr @entity37 said in a talk earlier this year			1
' @entity102 , a system of terrestrial - sized planets , formed when the universe was less than 20 percent of its current age , so that suggests that @entity6 - sized planets may have formed throughout most of the @entity109 's history , leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy			1
' the system 's innermost planet is the size of @entity117 , the middle three are the size of @entity120 , and the outermost is slightly smaller than @entity122			0
however , it is unlikely any of these planets host life - all of them orbit very close to their host star , closer than @entity117 orbits our own star			1
despite @entity40 being 25 per cent smaller and 700 degrees cooler than the sun , this distance is thought to be too small , and the temperatures too hot , for life to survive			0
but , it is the age and size of the planets that it is of most interest , however - and it is not unfeasible to think @entity6 - sized planets in more habitable orbits may have formed elsewhere in the universe			1
the discovery of the extrasolar system - 117 light - years away in the @entity36 - was made by dr @entity37 , an astronomer from the @entity22 in the @entity144			1
with his team , he studied the star called @entity40 , which had been found by the @entity42 ( illustration shown ) it is unlikely any of these planets host life - all of them orbit very close to their host star , closer than @entity117 orbits our own star ( shown in diagram )			1
but it is the age and size of the planets that it is of most interest , and it is not unfeasible to think @entity6 - sized planets in more habitable orbits formed elsewhere life on @entity6 is thought to have taken billions of years to reach the state it is in today , leading some to believe we might be one of the first planets in our galaxy to have formed complex life			1
but , if other planets have been around more than twice as long as @entity6 , it 's likely life could have started elsewhere			2
others have suggested a lack of life discovered elsewhere might be due to complex life being extremely rare			0
in december , however , @entity174 scientist dr @entity173 argued that life was actually common			0
in a series of talks given to several universities , he said the origin of life ' should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill			0
' he added : ' you start with a random clump of atoms , and if you shine light on it for long enough , it should not be so surprising that you get a plant			0
' other @entity6 - sized worlds like @entity191 ( illustration shown ) have been found before			1
however , its age was not too dissimilar to @entity6			0
the discovery that some @entity6 - sized worlds are much older than our own planet is hugely important , and could have big implications in the search for life the reason for this , and the underlying aspect of his theory , is that while all matter - from rocks to plants - absorbs and dissipates energy , life is much better at redistributing it			1
this means atoms will eventually reorganise themselves into life because it is better at dissipating the energy in the water			0
if true , the implications of dr @entity219 's theories are vast			0
perhaps most importantly , it may suggest life elsewhere in the universe is not as rare as once thought , but rather is as common as planets and stars themselves			2
and together with this latest discovery of ancient planets , it brings us one step closer to finding out if we are alone in the universe or not .			0

@entity22 team has found an ancient planetary system
at 11.2 billion years old , it is more than twice the age of our solar system
the system has a star with five planets in tight , *uninhabitable* orbits
however , the planets are the size of our own , suggesting @entity6 - sized planets have been forming throughout the history of the universe
this means that life could have formed much earlier than first thought
astronomer dr @entity37 said it leaves open ' the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy '
