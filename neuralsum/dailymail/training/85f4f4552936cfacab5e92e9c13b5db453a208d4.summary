by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:02 est , 22 january 2014 updated : 13:05 est , 22 january 2014 @entity4 is preparing to launch two new big screen iphones in june , it has been claimed			1
one will come with a 4.7inch screen , and one with a 5.7inch screen			1
previous rumours have pointed to a super slim ' @entity11 ' model , which could be the smaller handset			1
it is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements			0
if announced , the hansets are expected to go on sale within weeks			1
the latest claims come from @entity27 analyst @entity26			1
he told @entity27 - language website qq tech that @entity4 will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes			1
according to @entity32 , the @entity31 will come with a 4.7 - inch screen , with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels			2
the company would then launch a larger 5.7 - inch model shortly afterwards			0
@entity4 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity40 , and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its @entity31			1
concept images have emerged that show @entity4 's next - generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis			1
this concept , by @entity50 - based firm set solution , predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom , in order to retain the home button by comparison , @entity4 's current @entity56 , pictured , has a depth of 7.6mm			1
this makes it 1.7mm thinner than the @entity61 and 1.37mm thinner than the @entity62 up until august last year , @entity63 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity67 , at 6.18mm			0
this was then replaced by the @entity69 at just 5.75mm			0
by comparison , @entity4 ’s current @entity56 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity40 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			1
@entity73 's @entity72 is 7.9mm thick , while the @entity74 is 9.3mm			0
two concept images have emerged that show @entity4 ’s next - generation handset with a slender chassis , as well as a larger 5 - inch screen similar to those seen on the @entity72 and @entity74			1
the first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the ' @entity83 ' - will be 4.5mm thick , while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom			0
by comparison , @entity4 ’s current @entity56 has a depth of 7.6mm , while the @entity40 is slightly thinner at 7.5mm			2
up until august last year , @entity63 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity67 , at 6.18mm			0
this was then replaced by the @entity69 at just 5.75mm			0
in order to make the @entity4 phone super-thin , @entity97 ’s concept suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys			2
[ embed in order to make the @entity4 phone super-thin , @entity97 's concept - dubbed @entity83 - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls @entity4 surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin @entity40 , pictured , which was 20 % thinner than previous models @entity112 ’s concept , instead , keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top			1
it also appears taller than @entity97 ’s version in order to fit the larger screen			0
@entity4 ’s @entity31 has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the @entity56 would be the first to break the 4 - inch mark - but it did n't			1
@entity4 ’s ceo @entity126 has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they ’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand			2
however , with main rivals @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity132 releasing phones with screens in the 5 - inch region , analysts claim @entity4 may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people			2
last november , designer @entity139 created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the @entity31 's screen size , without drastically increasing the size of the handset			1
in his image , the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges			0
however , because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident , when it ’s picked up for example , the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced			0
according to @entity158 journalist @entity157 : ' the only way i could see something that thin working for users , is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket			0
' he continued that if @entity4 was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest , which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis , it could also pave the way for foldable devices			2
