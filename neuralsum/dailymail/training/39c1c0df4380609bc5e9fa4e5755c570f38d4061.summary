the awards season is upon us and personally i think it ’s a toss up for @entity3 between @entity4 as @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 as @entity8 in @entity9 and @entity10 as @entity11 in @entity12			1
somehow , even though there is plenty of video footage of @entity10 the lip going down more easily than @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity13 is not on the list of @entity22 nominations just announced in @entity23			2
nevertheless he gets this column ’s gong for his role as a simulator , holding off challenges in the second half of 2014 from several men he left behind in the @entity31 , including such unlikely candidates as defenders @entity33 and @entity35			1
a mock - up of how @entity37 striker @entity10 may look accepting an @entity22 @entity10 had an eventful 2014 , nearly winning the title with @entity39 before being banned for biting in the @entity40 and finally sealing a multi-million pound move to @entity37 @entity10 clutches at his incisors after biting the shoulder of @entity46 's @entity45 's shoulder at the @entity40 @entity10 clashes with @entity47 's @entity33 after sinking his teeth into the @entity49 in 2013 @entity50 goes to the preposterous loan system which allows major clubs to abuse the original intention of reserve players and small teams helping each other			1
thus we have seen two innocent footballers dragged into the mire , unwittingly no matter how much it may suit their pocket and purposes in the end			0
in yet another example of the ills of multi-club ownership , which is supposed to be banned , @entity64 finds himself on the bench for @entity69 for at least the rest of this season when he thought he had signed to play for @entity69 ’s subsidiary in @entity73			0
on the red side of @entity75 one @entity76 , who was led to believe that @entity77 intended to make his transfer permanent when they borrowed him from @entity79 , now discovers he is a loan of convenience at @entity82 , not primed as a £ 45 million purchase			0
@entity64 is top billing in @entity73 , but the arrival of the midfielder has been somewhat delayed @entity64 moved to @entity69 , via @entity87 , where he will stay until the end of the season @entity76 has been used sparingly by @entity90 and the @entity92 looks set to leave @entity77 the rest of our awards in full : best film – the @entity97 @entity98 – the @entity99 best weepie – unlucky seven , starring the @entity102 football @entity103 @entity104 – @entity105 in @entity106 biggest flop – @entity108 in @entity109 @entity110 – @entity112 in @entity113 , even though some scoffed at me for rating him superior in @entity102 2014 to @entity115 worst @entity116 from @entity103 – @entity117 in were you watching in @entity102 ? even though @entity119 has been pilloried for picking him ahead of @entity112 , @entity115 and the rest of the matinee idols best actor in a comedy – @entity124 , hopelessly mis - cast in @entity117 ’s role in were you were watching in @entity102 ? @entity117 has had another outstanding year for @entity37 and @entity126 the hapless @entity124 sums up @entity102 's 7 - 1 semi-final defeat to a ruthless @entity129 with a confused stare @entity112 poses alongside the award - winning @entity131 , @entity133 and @entity134 best farce – i ’m not voting for you , starring @entity112 and @entity115 @entity139 @entity138 – @entity140 in @entity141 , again best newcomer – @entity143 best director – @entity145 for @entity146 , the remake @entity98 adapted screenplay – @entity148 , @entity149 , from the original novel by @entity151 @entity152 – @entity153 for @entity154 – and for continuing to live and pay taxes in @entity156 unlike @entity157 in @entity158 and @entity159 in @entity160			2
@entity145 has overseen @entity146 's magnificent season , with the @entity146 currently in third spot multiple exposures show @entity153 completing her final gold medal run in @entity165 the golden girl celebrates her sensational victory in the skeleton best referee – no award @entity172 - @entity171 , @entity173 , starring @entity174 and @entity175 as themselves @entity177 – maybe @entity178 , starring @entity179 and @entity180 if they ever get themselves together best quote – @entity184 for ‘ do n’t count the years , make the years count ’ on the eve of his @entity186 ’s defying 73rd birthday this saturday .			0
