it was one hell of a strike to announce yourself to the @entity3 - but perhaps we should expect nothing less from someone who goes by the nickname ' @entity7 '			1
@entity7 's 70mph missile for @entity10 in their 2 - 2 draw with @entity12 on monday night left the @entity13 and the millions watching on tv open - jawed in amazement			1
as well as being an early contender for the goal of the season award , it offered hope to the @entity10 faithful that this season might be more than another miserable relegation struggle			2
but who is the man with rockets in his boots ? here 's a look at @entity30 's career so far , from @entity31 to the @entity32			1
his childhood was spent kicking a ball around and at the age of 16 , he left home to join the youth ranks at @entity56 , the same club that nurtured the talents of his namesake @entity30 ( no relation )			0
he was originally a winger but gradually converted into a striker when it became apparent that he packed a fearsome shot			0
after three years there , @entity7 was spotted by @entity64 , one of the country 's most prominent teams based in the city of @entity68			1
@entity7 celebrates after scoring the first of his two goals in the 2 - 1 @entity71 win over @entity72 in an interview back in his homeland , @entity7 's father said his son was so passionate about football he would get all his chores out the way and even skip dinner to make sure he could spend the rest of his day kicking a ball around			1
@entity83 said : ' he did all his chores when he came home from school - milk cows , pack and load products and clear water from the canoe - and then would not eat to go and play soccer			0
' @entity30 hails from @entity92 stock and from a very poor area of the country			2
when he arrived in @entity68 , he had no money for lodgings and had to sleep at the club 's @entity98			0
it took a little time for the forward to break into the first team but under @entity105 coach @entity104 , the man who led @entity106 at the @entity71 this summer , he started getting opportunities			2
his first goal for @entity64 came on march 10 , 2010 away to their rivals @entity109 , helping secure a vital win			0
the goals had begun to flow			0
a reliable @entity113 @entity30 quickly became a fixture in the @entity64 side and contributed nine league goals in 30 outings during the 2011 campaign			1
unfortunately , his efforts were in vain as the team lost 1 - 0 to @entity123 over the two legs of the @entity126 final , the second year in succession they had missed out at this point			0
@entity30 showing his trademark pace as he nips between @entity131 's @entity130 and @entity132 incredibly the following year it happened again and in heart - breaking circumstances as city rivals @entity133 trumped them			2
but while the team missed out , it was @entity7 's most successful season yet , with 13 goals in 40 league appearances			2
his scoring feats did n't escape the notice of national team manager @entity145 and @entity7 made his debut on february 12 , 2012 in a friendly with @entity72			0
@entity148 it was fourth time lucky for @entity7 and @entity64 in 2013			2
the forward scored a number of crucial goals as the club ended its 11 - year wait for the title			0
he was also the top scorer in the @entity157 , the @entity159 equivalent of the @entity160 , with five goals in four matches			0
@entity64 did n't advance beyond the second round , however			0
but it was enough to attract the attention of @entity167 side @entity166 and a deal was agreed in january this year			1
@entity30 celebrates his towering header in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity171 in @entity172 just before the @entity71 @entity7 earned his ' @entity7 ' nickname while in his final season at @entity64			1
fans admired his power and pace , not to mention his uncanny ability to pop up and score a vital goal at the perfect moment			0
@entity7 immediately found the @entity181 to his liking and in just 17 outings during the second half of the regular season he notched 12 goals			2
in the end - of - season play - offs , he scored a hat - trick in a 4 - 2 away win at @entity189 and a vital goal in the semi-final , second leg at @entity193			1
and when he scored twice more in a 3 - 2 first leg win over @entity195 in the final , @entity166 looked odds - on for success			1
however , they blew it , losing 2 - 0 at home after extra time to end the season on a low note			2
international recognition following the tragic death of @entity207 in july 2013 , opportunities opened up for @entity7 and his form in @entity31 's 2014 friendlies made him a natural choice for the @entity71			1
the first time an @entity213 audience caught a glimpse of his abilities was when he powered a bullet header past @entity217 in the early stages of @entity31 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity171 in @entity172 just before the finals			1
@entity30 is fouled by @entity12 's @entity221 during monday night 's match at the @entity13 he again demonstrated his aerial prowess to put @entity31 ahead in their opening @entity71 match with @entity227 and grabbed two more in the win over @entity72 a few days later			1
his efforts were n't enough to secure a last 16 berth , however , as @entity227 progressed alongside @entity131			0
@entity7 was firmly in the shop window and his value rocketed			0
@entity233 amid interest from a number of @entity237 clubs , @entity10 tabled a £ 12m bid and secured @entity7 's signature on a five - year contract at the end of july			1
upon arriving in @entity242 , he said : ' i really appreciate the welcome i 've bene given and i 'm excited to be here			0
' i 've already watched and read a lot about the club to learn about it - i know the fans are really passionate and i 'm really glad to have signed			0
' he came off the bench to replace @entity250 with nine minutes remaining of the opening day clash with @entity252			0
but it was that goal against @entity12 that really signalled his arrival in @entity171 and @entity10 fans will hope it 's the first of many			1
@entity7 uses his arm to hold off the challenge of @entity12 's @entity259 during the 2 - 2 draw			1

@entity7 hit the *headlines* with a stunning 70mph strike in @entity10 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity12 on monday night
he shot to prominence in @entity213 with his *performances* for @entity31 at the @entity71 over the summer
his three goals *persuaded* @entity10 to part with £ 12m to sign him
@entity30 , 24 , hails from an *impoverished* and remote part of @entity31
as a youngster he would skip dinner so he could play football
he developed into a regular scorer for @entity64 in his homeland
@entity30 then moved to @entity167 side @entity166 before coming to @entity242
his nickname is ' @entity7 ' so we should expect the spectacular
