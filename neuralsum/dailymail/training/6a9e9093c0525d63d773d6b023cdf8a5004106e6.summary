the days of unreliable forecasts could be over - as the @entity1 has started using a computer programme so powerful it can foretell the weather across every mile of the country			1
it is hoped the @entity7 model will be able to accurately predict the thunderstorms , black ice , and flash floods which are caused by weather systems too severe or small to be seen by current programmes			1
the breakthrough comes after the @entity1 was criticised for its ‘ pitiful ’ forecasts last winter – thought to be the worst predictions since @entity17 ’s infamous reassurance that there was no hurricane on the way in october 1987			1
the @entity1 has started using a computer programme that can foretell the weather across every mile of the country			1
it was criticised for its ' pitiful ' forecasts which predicted a dry winter , only for the country to experience some of the worst flooding since records began - including in @entity29 ( pictured ) @entity7 will work by building a virtual model of the @entity31			1
the technology will then enable meteorologists to pinpoint the weather at 100 metre points on the ground and up to 11 miles above ground			0
last winter forecasters predicted a large area of the country which includes the @entity41 – still under water after more than two months of flooding – would most likely see rainfall levels well below average			2
instead it was confirmed the @entity31 had instead suffered the wettest winter since records began			0
the @entity1 stopped publishing its long - range forecasts for the public to see in 2010 , after its disastrous prediction of a ‘ barbeque summer ’ in 2009 – which ended in washouts throughout july and august			1
the three - month forecasts are now sent only to contingency planners , such as councils , government departments , and insurance companies			0
until now , even powerful super-computers have been able to perform only slightly better than chance when predicting long - term weather conditions			0
but the latest model , which simulates the climate on a more detailed scale , was found to be 62 per cent accurate at broad predictions of weather conditions when it was tested on 20 years of retrospective data			2
dramatic : a stormy winter this year followed wrongly - placed reassurances from the @entity1 and scientists at the @entity1 claim the reliability will improve , estimating that accuracy will increase to 80 per cent			1
the breakthrough is due to stronger computing power , allowing scientists to take into account much smaller changes in the gulfstream and @entity80 sea ice coverage , which impact on the @entity31 climate			2
dr @entity83 , manager of the @entity84 , said : this development took 10 years and in the past two years staff from across the @entity1 have tested and evaluated its impact and prepared our operational systems for its implementation			0
stuff of legend : @entity17 famously failed to predict the 1987 hurricane - but he relied on others ' data ' in global models , @entity7 's improved accuracy and reduced damping produces more detail in synoptic features such as cyclones , fronts and jet stream winds			2
the last of these is particularly important for the aviation industry , which relies on accurate forecasts of the jet streams for planning intercontinental flights			0
' @entity7 's improved scalability means that we can produce a global weather prediction as quickly as our current operational system , but with its resolution increased from 25 km to 17 km. this enhanced resolution ( or higher definition ) provides additional improvements to forecast accuracy			1
better scalability means that we will be able to further increase the model 's resolution on delivery of our next supercomputer			0
' the programme was designed by professor @entity125 from the @entity126			0
@entity7 stands for even @entity127 for general atmospheric modelling of the environment .			0

scientists developed new model to forecast weather months in advance
@entity7 will predict thunderstorms , black ice , and flash floods
it comes after @entity1 was criticised for ' pitiful ' forecasts last winter
