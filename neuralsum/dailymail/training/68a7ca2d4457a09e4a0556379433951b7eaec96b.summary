by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:40 am on 28th february 2012 mix - up : a new mother was given the wrong newborn in hospital , which she subsequently breastfed not knowing it was n't her child a new mother was left breast - feeding someone else ’s baby after blundering hospital staff gave her the wrong child , a hearing was told yesterday			1
two newborns had been taken away to be cared for just hours after being born , while their mothers rested , the @entity17 heard			0
but ward staff later returned the wrong babies to the women , known as @entity23 and @entity24 when the mix - up was noticed , midwife @entity25 failed to record it and even tried to convince a student not to ‘ drop anybody in the s * * * ’ by keeping quiet about it			1
@entity32 , for the @entity17 , said @entity25 also told @entity23 that her baby had not been fed , when in fact it had been breast - fed by the other mother			2
the blunder happened at @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , on november 13 , 2007			0
mr @entity32 said : ‘ both of the babies were having some trouble settling and were taken from their mothers , with the agreement of the mothers , to a different area where they were looked after by midwives and health care assistants			0
there was a mistake on their return – in fact there were two mistakes – as @entity54 was returned to the @entity23 , and @entity55 was given to @entity24 ‘ when the mistake had been realised , they were recovered and given back to the correct mothers			0
’ when @entity25 returned @entity55 to @entity23 , she told her the child had not been fed without checking if this was the case			2
probe : the blunder happened at @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 , on november 13 , 2007 ‘ as it turns out , ’ said mr @entity32 , ‘ the baby had been fed ; breast - fed by @entity64 , who at the time had thought she was feeding her own baby			0
