the married practitioner , who goes by the name of dr @entity16 , denied he was at fault and insisted it was how he had been instructed to check breasts while training in @entity20			1

@entity31 where dr @entity16 worked			2
the married practitioner denied he was at fault yesterday the @entity33 in @entity34 found dr @entity16 , 48 , guilty of misconduct and suspended him for a year			1
the doctor , who has an @entity38 post as consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at @entity41 , was also found to be at fault for failing to offer a chaperone or make a record of the breast check in the patient ’s notes			2
the panel was told how during the consultation in october 2010 at @entity50 in @entity51 , dr @entity16 asked the woman to lift up her top and bra , before cupping and squeezing her breasts with both hands from behind			2
@entity57 told the hearing she still ‘ beats herself up ’ for allowing herself to be ‘ sexually assaulted ’			0
she said : ‘ i left the room that day and i just ... it just felt so wrong			0
i could just not get the examination out of my head and i actually said , “ what just happened in there ? ” ’ describing the doctor ’s response to her complaint , she added : ‘ he did n’t deny anything i said			0
he said that ’s how he was taught in @entity7			0
’ she told the panel she was so disturbed she could not even bring herself to tell her husband			0
the panel was told that dr @entity16 , who qualified from the @entity75 in 1988 , had been questioned over the incident by director of nursing @entity77			2

panel chairman @entity93 told dr @entity16 : ‘ the panel accepted that this is an isolated case and that the breast examination was clinically indicated			1
‘ however , the manner in which you conducted the breast examination on @entity57 was clearly sexually motivated			1
your conduct ... amounted to serious misconduct			0
