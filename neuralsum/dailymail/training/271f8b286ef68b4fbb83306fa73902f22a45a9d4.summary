by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 21 february 2013 @entity2 holidaymakers were last night warned to expect less cash in their pockets when they head abroad as the value of the pound tumbles			1

tough journey : the gbp drop against the euro and the @entity10 dollar is going to hit @entity2 travellers hard with holidays becoming more expensive going down : this 18 - month graph shows how sterling fell to a 16 - month low against the euro yesterday the slump has pushed up the cost of travelling abroad for @entity2 , with everything from hotel rooms in @entity33 to ski passes in the @entity35 far more expensive			1
analysts warned that the slump was likely to continue in the coming months as @entity2 teeters on the brink of a triple - dip recession and the national debt spirals higher			2
‘ the market has sterling in its cross hairs , ’ said @entity40 , a currency strategist at @entity41 in @entity42			0

this is n’t great news for cash - strapped brits			0
’ the pound has not suffered such an aggressive fall since the financial crisis and it is feared the slump has further to go as the chances of a disastrous break - up of the eurozone recede , at least for now , and @entity2 ’s coveted @entity80 credit rating comes under pressure			0
@entity82 , market strategist at trading firm @entity83 , said : ‘ @entity7 finds itself under renewed pressure as the possibility of a ratings downgrade looms ever larger			0
- @entity46 , @entity47 banking group ‘ if indeed the @entity2 does lose its @entity80 credit rating , then any last embers of a safe haven type environment , established because of the even weaker performance of rival economies , would likely dissipate , especially if investors decide , rightly or wrongly , that the eurozone and @entity10 are finally emerging from the doldrums			2
’ @entity97 , @entity2 economist at @entity98 , said : ‘ @entity7 ’s sharp drop against the euro seems to have reflected markets ’ increasing belief that the economic outlook for the @entity2 is broadly as bad as it is in the eurozone			2
