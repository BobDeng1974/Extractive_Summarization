by @entity0 published : 00:16 est , 10 july 2012 updated : 20:34 est , 10 july 2012 @entity1 is standing behind his comments about shadow chancellor @entity3 @entity1 is refusing calls to apologise for saying @entity3 had ‘ questions to answer ’ over the bank rate - fixing scandal			1
demands for an apology from the chancellor were even backed by some senior @entity11 , including his predecessor @entity12 , who said mr @entity1 had ‘ overplayed his hand ’ , adding : ‘ if there is an allegation @entity3 was involved , it does n’t stand up			1
’ conservative mp @entity19 , a member of the @entity20 , triggered fury in the @entity22 by saying mr @entity1 had clearly made a mistake and should now say sorry			1
@entity1 had tried to link the 2008 rate - fixing scandal to his opposite number mr @entity3 , who was a key figure in the @entity28 government at the time			1
but mrs @entity19 said evidence to mps from @entity33 deputy governor @entity32 , who insisted there had been no pressure from @entity28 ministers to persuade banks to manipulate their rates , had ‘ completely squashed ’ mr @entity1 ’s allegations			1
obviously he made a mistake and i think he should apologise , ’ she told @entity43 ’s @entity44			2
‘ i think it was a very valid discussion at the time about who knew what and it has now been completely squashed by @entity32			0
’ @entity22 spokesman @entity50 described mr @entity32 ’s evidence as ‘ the final nail in the coffin of the @entity11 smear campaign the chancellor led last week ’			2
deputy governor @entity32 rejected claims @entity28 ministers , including former city minister @entity3 asked him to pressure @entity59 to lower @entity61 submissions but @entity63 ’s spokesman insisted mr @entity1 would not apologise , saying : ‘ @entity64 has been making the position clear that he wo n’t			1
he [ the prime minister ] agrees with the @entity22			1
’ a @entity22 source said : ‘ @entity28 protests too much			0
can they say that no @entity28 figure was aware of @entity61 low - balling ? @entity32 , pictured , denied he was ever encouraged to ' lean on ' @entity59 to lower its @entity61 submissions ‘ can they say no @entity28 figure implicitly or explicitly condoned it in conversations with the banks ? they have n’t been able to so far			0
’ mr @entity32 , who is a frontrunner for the role of governor when sir @entity78 steps down , told mps this week a record of a contentious phonecall he had with former @entity59 boss @entity82 about @entity61 gave the ' wrong impression '			2
appearing in front of the @entity86 , the senior banker said he had intended to ensure @entity59 was not ' inadvertently sending distress signals ' about its financial health at a time when the market viewed the bank as the next in line for a government bailout			0
the deputy governor rejected claims that the then @entity98 chief of staff sir @entity99 , then @entity96 minister @entity3 and former treasury minister @entity97 had asked him to pressure @entity59 to lower its @entity61 submissions			2
he expressed concern that the rates for borrowing in @entity104 dollars were falling faster than those in sterling			0
in one email , sir @entity99 asked mr @entity32 if he had heard that @entity61 is high ‘ because @entity59 are bidding it ’			0
however , at no point do the email exchanges show sir @entity99 encouraging mr @entity32 to tell @entity59 to manipulate its rates artificially			0
other figures mr @entity32 suggested had raised concerns about borrowing rates include @entity116 ’s private secretary @entity115 , another senior adviser sir @entity115 and treasury permanent secretary sir @entity117 .			0
