too bewildered and dehumanised to show any emotion , a dozen young faces peer out from a world beyond comprehension			1
witnesses to unfathomable depths of human savagery , these are among the last occupants of history ’s most infamous slaughterhouse			1
to stand in the @entity13 chill of @entity14 today , it seems extraordinary that anyone survived what unfolded here			1
yet , astonishingly , most of the people in this photograph – taken exactly 70 years ago today – are still alive			1
what ’s more , four of them – including a victim of the abominable human vivisectionist , dr @entity22 – have returned to @entity14 to mark the 70th anniversary of the day that @entity26 troops liberated this place			1
and around 100 survivors will gather here this afternoon , alongside world leaders , to remember all of the 6million @entity61 victims of @entity63 ’s trans - contintental programme of industrial genocide			1
having beaten such insuperable odds to stay alive , it is a solemn sense of obligation to both past and future generations which has persuaded this small , heroic band to make this painful return journey for today ’s anniversary			1
ahead of the ceremonies , there have been some extraordinary and deeply moving scenes here , not least a reprise of that famous liberation photograph by @entity79 photographer @entity78			1
after extensive detective work , the @entity81 - based @entity80 , created by director @entity82 , has tracked down the names of nearly all those in the photo to arrange this week ’s reunion			1
@entity41 was a few days short of her eleventh birthday when the @entity26 suddenly arrived , along with @entity78 and his ‘ huge ’ cameras			1
‘ we could n’t believe that we really were free , ’ @entity41 tells me			2
‘ so we kept walking out of the gate and then back in again			2
to do that without being shot – well , that was such a feeling of freedom that i still do it when i come back all these years later			2
’ @entity96 a holocaust survivor , centre , prays with fellow survivors upon arriving at the @entity14 in a private visit to the camp today mr @entity96 is comforted by fellow survivors after becoming emotional on returning to @entity14 to mark the 70th anniversary of the camp 's liberation mr @entity96 is embraced by @entity105 , the president of the @entity106			1
mr @entity96 's mother and sisters died at the camp when he was 11 tears of emotion as survivor , @entity112 , 82 , returns to the death camp for the 70th anniversary of the liberation of @entity14 @entity116 , 85 , right , a survivor of @entity14 , and her husband @entity118 , 85 , visit the former death camp			1
mrs @entity116 's parents and four siblings died at @entity14 mrs @entity116 and her husband show the tattoos on their arms that they were both forced to have when arriving at @entity14 with their families @entity128 survivor @entity127 shows the tattoo he was forced to have at @entity14			1
tomorrow survivors will join heads of state at an event to mark 70 years since the camp was liberated at 80 , she is a magnificent monument to the power of positive thought , proudly rolling up her sleeve to show me her prison number – a- 7063 – tattooed on her arm			1
‘ people ask why i did n’t get it removed			2
well , i paid a high price for this ! ’ @entity41 owes her survival to the fact she arrived from @entity151 - occupied @entity150 in 1944 with her twin sister , @entity152			1
most @entity61 children too small for slave labour would be taken straight to the gas chambers but the camp doctor , @entity22 , had issued special orders for twins			2
they were needed for his gruesome medical research			2
the ten - year - old sisters were dragged from the family they would never see again and the experiments began almost immediately			2
‘ monday , wednesday and friday , we had hours of measurement of every part of our bodies – so demeaning , ’ says @entity41 matter of factly			2
‘ tuesdays , thursdays and saturdays , i had five injections in my right arm and , to this day , i have no idea what was in them			2
’ on one occasion , she was left so ill she heard @entity22 tell medical staff she would be dead in a fortnight			2
‘ i was only ten but all i could think was “ i am not going to let @entity22 win ”			0
once one twin was dead , the other was superfluous to requirements and would be executed			0
@entity41 had to stay alive to save @entity152			0
weeks later , she risked hanging to steal two potatoes from the kitchens for her sister			0
‘ @entity152 had dysentery and i thought the only way to keep her alive was to get her potatoes			0
’ having returned home after the war , the sisters found rampant anti-semitism – ‘ there were local rumours about @entity61 vampires ; people believed them ’ – and emigrated to @entity190 before , finally , moving to the @entity191			0
@entity152 died in 1993 , but not before returning with @entity41 in 1985			2
‘ you know the first thing we did ? we went and touched the barbed wire to feel what it was like not to be electrocuted			0
’ @entity41 still has one burning ambition			0
‘ there must be files somewhere saying what was in those injections which @entity22 gave me			0
i have to find out			0
’ mr @entity127 walks alongside the perimeter fence at the concentration camp			1
he was one of the survivors paying homage to those who died during the @entity212 @entity214 survivor of @entity215 walks among the barracks at the former concentration camp past a picture , wearing his military medals an elderly survivor is led into @entity14 today for a private visit to the camp ahead of tomorrow 's anniversary of its liberation by the @entity26 army @entity227 with survivor @entity228 visit @entity14 ahead of tomorrow 's anniversary of the liberation of the camp a group of visitors to @entity14 hold up an @entity190 flag at the front gate of @entity14 below the infamous ' @entity236 ' sign at the former @entity63 death camp shoes that were taken from the past prisoners have been piled up and put on display in the memorial museum at the former death camp site every survivor has some sort of heartbreaking unfinished business here			1
beneath one of the @entity248 ’s most despicable lies , @entity96 is consumed with grief			0
‘ i do n’t ever want to come back here ever again ! ’ he shrieks			0
‘ ever ! ’ the first time he saw the gates of @entity14 , he was a bewildered 11 - year - old from @entity150			1
now , at the age of 82 , this founding father of the state of @entity190 is once again standing beneath the infamous archway to @entity14 and its grotesque slogan : ‘ @entity236 ’ – ‘ @entity236 ’			1
though it is the third time mr @entity96 has been back here since the war , every attempt to articulate his feelings is quashed by emotion			2
but he does n’t need to say a thing			0
for 1.1million people , including most of mr @entity96 ’s family , @entity14 meant death			1
for many others , this dismal railway town in southern @entity268 was an horrific transit point on the way to being murdered somewhere else – in a labour camp or on a ‘ death march ’ to another prison - mortuary			1
among the many millions who met their death here were @entity268 , gypsies and @entity26 prisoners of war			1
only 8,000 emaciated prisoners were still inside @entity14 and its sub-camps when @entity284 ’s forces arrived in january 1945			1
the rest – like mr @entity96 – were already being herded across central @entity286 with just flimsy pyjamas and wooden clogs to protect them against the winter			0
most were dead by the time @entity286 was liberated in may 1945			1
another survivor on a painful quest here is @entity294			0
having arrived in 1943 , his training in his father ’s @entity298 barber ’s shop landed him with an horrific assignment – shaving women prisoners destined for the gas chambers			0
after the war , he emigrated to @entity304 and built a successful hair salon on @entity307 ’s @entity306			0
until this week , he had never been back to @entity286 , let alone @entity14			1
now he is here with his son , @entity308			0
‘ i had to see where my mother and my baby sister were murdered , ’ he says , walking slowly but purposefully through the slush to the site of the original @entity14 gas chamber			1
‘ and i had to come with the next generation to show them what really happened			0
’ today is the first time since @entity308 was a child that @entity294 has seen his son cry			1
he himself can not stem the flow as he stands in the unlit chamber of horrors			0
‘ you ca n’t imagine the smell , ’ he whispers again and again			0
‘ my heart is breaking … ’ @entity294 keeps asking our guide to show him where his mother and sister might have breathed their last but , as with so much else here , no one can be sure			0
no explanation is needed as we walk through @entity334 where the hair of 50,000 prisoners – unearthed by the sackload after liberation – is piled the length of the building			2
next door in @entity342 , we see another large glass - fronted display case			2
as powerful as any words or photograph , it contains thousands of children ’s shoes			0
@entity294 throws up his hands and walks out			0
back at the gate , @entity294 is accosted by a young woman pushing a pram			0
‘ i am @entity355 and all i can say is how sorry i am , ’ she says , and presses a tiny flower brooch into his hand			0
afterwards , he tries to explain how much it means to him			0
‘ such a small thing and such a very big thing … ’ and he can find no more words .			0

@entity14 survivors visited the @entity63 concentration camp today ahead of the 70th anniversary of its liberation
four of the survivors were pictured with an image taken exactly 70 years ago when the camp was freed
they travelled from all over the world for the visit with many returning to the camp for the first time to pay respects
several gathered together entering the camp to say a prayer *underneath* the infamous ' @entity236 ' sign
the camp in @entity63 - occupied @entity268 was liberated at the end of the @entity49 by the @entity26 army in 1945
