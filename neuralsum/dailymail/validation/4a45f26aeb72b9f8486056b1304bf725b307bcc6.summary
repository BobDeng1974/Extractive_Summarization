@entity0 is considering a women ’s @entity2 championship to give fans extra value for money during grand prix weekends			1
@entity0 , the sport ’s chief executive , floated the idea at a meeting with team bosses before sunday ’s @entity12			1
if he manages to get his way , the likes of @entity15 test driver @entity14 , her counterpart at @entity16 , @entity18 ’s @entity17 and emerging @entity21 talent @entity19 could all be handed drives			2
@entity0 floated the idea at a meeting with team bosses before sunday ’s @entity26 @entity12 ‘ i thought it would be a good idea to give them a showcase , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ for some reason , women are not coming through — and not because we do n’t want them			0
of course we do , because they would attract a lot of attention and publicity and probably a lot of sponsors			0
‘ we have to start somewhere so i suggested to the teams that we have a separate championship and maybe that way we will be able to bring someone through to @entity2			2
they could race before the main event or perhaps on the saturday qualifying day			0
‘ it is only a thought at the moment but i think it would be super for @entity2 and the whole grand prix weekend			0
’ the likes of @entity15 test driver @entity14 could feature in @entity0 's proposed women - only race @entity52 was the last woman to start a @entity2 race , in 1976 , and the only one to score points			1
@entity0 ’s support for a female series comes 15 years after he controversially joked that women should dress in white like all domestic appliances			2
