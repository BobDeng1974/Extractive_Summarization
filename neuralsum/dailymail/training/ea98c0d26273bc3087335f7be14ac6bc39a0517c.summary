it sounds a little like something @entity3 might have dreamed up			0
but do n’t panic – not all the fires that raged across @entity5 during @entity7 ’s bombing onslaught were homes and factories ablaze			1
for a cunning plan to build decoy towns and set them alight bamboozled the @entity13 into believing they had hit their targets			1
burning : a starfish basket fire is pictured in an unknown location			1
the starfish sites - which got their name from the initials ' sf ' , standing for ' @entity23 ' sites - were intended to simulate burning cities during the @entity25 decoy : a boiling oil fire is pictured at an unidentified starfish site			1
starfish sites were first created in december 1940 and received five blitz attempts just that month the so - called @entity32 towns , named after initials that actually stood for ‘ special fire ’ sites , were commissioned to avoid the kind of disaster that destroyed @entity37 during the @entity25			1
the dummy towns were sited miles away from communities and cities likely to come under attack			2
as soon as the first wave of @entity45 bombers lit up or attacked a real target , emergency teams raced to extinguish the flames – then lit the decoy fires			1
the aim was to convince the second wave this was the target and to fool them into dropping bombs harmlessly on the decoy site			2
the ruse was developed by colonel @entity56 , a respected engineer and retired @entity58 officer			0
but the construction , deployment and ignition of the fires may have been more akin to a stroke of @entity65 - style genius			0
tanks containing paraffin or diesel were placed on top of 20ft towers , arranged to resemble rows of buildings or industrial complexes			1
ready for action : an anonymous starfish site is pictured			2
@entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 were protected by the sites - with the @entity45 pilots thinking that a starfish site 14 miles away from the latter was @entity83 a valve that operated like a toilet flush was opened to release the fuel on to burning coal , creating an instant blaze and engulfing the area in black smoke			1
then the fire was flushed with water to send a column of steam into the night sky			1
result : a rather convincing mock - up of a bombing raid that hit its target			0
dummy sites were a key tactic to preserving important transport hubs and cities in @entity5 during the bombings of @entity104			2
there were around 230 dummy airfields in the @entity5 and 400 dummy urban and industrial sites			2
dummy railway marshalling yards and docks also existed in an attempt to trick the @entity13			0
by the end of the war there were 237 starfish sites protecting 81 cities , factories and other potential targets			0
official figures reveal that 730 bombing raids were diverted to these dummy targets			0
among them was one built several miles outside @entity83 , home of @entity126 aero engine production			0
@entity127 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity128 and @entity129 were some of the other major cities protected			0
starfish towns were among several decoy projects used to dupe the enemy during the @entity104			1
other masterstrokes included building depots of cardboard tanks , or planting landing lights to look like airfields			0
from above : this is an aerial photo taken in 1944 of @entity141 , the decoy in @entity143 in south - west @entity144			0

starfish decoy towns in @entity5 helped to dupe @entity148 *aircraft* during @entity25
they were built to lure enemy bombers away from more *populated* areas
tanks containing diesel and paraffin were placed on top of 20ft towers
@entity160 was released onto coke or coal before water was released on top
caused a *virtual* *explosion* of fire and steam , looking like a burning town
