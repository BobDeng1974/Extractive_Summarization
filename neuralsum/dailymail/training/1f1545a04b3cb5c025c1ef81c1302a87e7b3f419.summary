the brother of one of @entity3 's murderers said today that the decision to give his sibling a whole life prison sentence was islamophobic			1
@entity7 believes @entity8 should not be forced to die behind bars and claims the judge in his @entity12 trial caved in to ' pressure ' after ' gave the public what they wanted '			1
last month @entity8 , 29 , was given a whole - life term , while @entity18 , 22 , was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years			1
@entity8 was given the longest possible sentence because the judge believed he had no hope of rehabilitation , but his brother said today if released he would ' pose no danger to the public ' and ' lead a very productive life were he to be released '			1
defence : @entity8 described himself as a ' soldier of @entity31 ' and attempted to decapitate @entity3 , but his brother @entity32 , right , says his whole life sentence was islamophobic @entity35 life lost : @entity3 was walking innocently along a @entity37 road towards his barracks when he was run down and butchered the @entity40 - born extremists mowed down @entity41 in a car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near @entity47 in south - east @entity48 in may last year			1
accomplice : @entity18 was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years - meaning he could be back on the streets by the age of 67 they both claimed that they were ‘ soldiers of @entity31 ’ and were motivated by the plight of @entity57 abroad to carry out the killing , and have shown no remorse			1
today @entity7 , who like his brother is a @entity60 convert , told the @entity61 today that his sibling was unfairly treated			1
he pointed to the sentencing of @entity64 , who was jailed for 40 years for killing a man and planning to bomb three mosques to start a ' race war ' in @entity40			2
' it seems strange to me that a man can be sentence to ( whole ) life for the death of one man and another can be sentenced to 40 years for the death of one and the attempted murder of many others , ' he told @entity79			1
' i wonder what the difference is here , aside from the guilty plea , aside from that i see that someone has died in both cases			0
' it seems strange that @entity86 can suggest there is no prospect of rehabilitation for my brother but there is for the @entity93 man who openly stated he wanted to start a race war ' yes ( it is islamophobic )			1
not only that i think it was trial by the public			0
there was a lot of public outrage , as could be understood			0
the death of a soldier in any country would provoke that , but i would suggest that @entity86 was giving in to that pressure '			0
during their sentencing last month violence broke out in the @entity12 dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards			0
anger : the @entity61 has received criticism for allowing his brother on the air in the first place fight : during @entity8 and @entity18 's sentencing , violence broke out in the @entity12 dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards			1
above , a court sketch of the violence taken away head first : mr @entity86 was forced to sentence the men in their absence after they were bundled out of the courtroom following their violent outburst in extraordinary scenes , the two @entity60 extremists yelled ' @entity136 ' and ' you ( @entity40 ) and @entity138 will never be safe ' during their sentencing at the court in @entity48			0
shocking : a blood - drenched @entity8 ( pictured ) told witnesses in a video his attack on @entity3 was an act of revenge - ' an @entity146 ' justice @entity86 was forced to jail them while they banged on the ceilings of their cells below the courtroom			1
the judge said the pair 's behaviour was ‘ sickening and pitiless ’ , and that @entity8 had no hope of rehabilitation			1
‘ your sickening and pitiless conduct was in stark contrast to the compassion and bravery shown by the various women at the scene who tended to @entity3 's body and challenged what you had done and said			0
’ @entity7 also said his brother should not have been tried for murder			2
' @entity3 was performing a public service			0
it would have been more fitting , i think , that my brother , a @entity40 citizen , be charged with treason for killing a soldier			0
it is the first time that a man has killed another man and been sentenced to a whole life tariff , ' he said			2
when asked if he should one day be released he said : ' i believe my brother would lead a very productive life were he to be released			2
were he to be rehabilitated i think he would lead a productive life – i think it ’s important not to forget that he has young children himself			2
' @entity79 also asked him if he had sympathy for @entity3 's family , but would only be drawn on his son @entity189			0
' i have a tremendous amount of sympathy towards the son of @entity3 who will grow up without a father , and i think my brother does too '			0
the @entity61 defended the interview today			2
' all interviews broadcast on @entity61 5 live are carefully considered , ' a spokesman said			2
' we decided this interview , which was robust and challenging throughout and let listeners hear for the first time the reaction of @entity8 ’s family to his sentencing , was in the public interest '			1
demand for justice : the bereft family of @entity3 wore t - shirts in his honour on the day his killers were sentence ( left to right ) stepfather @entity215 , his mother @entity205 and sisters @entity208 and @entity209 walked into the @entity12 together moving : the only son of @entity3 , @entity189 , holds the hands of the loved - ones as he attended his father 's funeral in july			2
his mother @entity221 told @entity86 that he will grow up to see images of his father ' horrific murder @entity8 is already appealing his conviction on technical legal grounds , using public funds to pay his legal fees			2
his qc told the court that sentencing his client to life without parole would make him a ' martyr ' , while @entity18 's legal team said a whole - life term would be ' inhuman ' for a man that age			1
during their trial , @entity3 's bereft family were forced to watch footage and hear gruesome accounts of the soldier being run down at 40mph and hacked to death in the street			0
the jury , who were all offered counselling , took just 90 minutes to find the killers guilty of the fusilier ’s murder , but not guilty of the attempted murder of police			0
before impact : this @entity255 footage shows a @entity256 about to crash into @entity3 as he crosses the road @entity8 and @entity18 mowed down @entity3 in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers			1
the streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street @entity7 concentrated on the case of @entity93 white supremacist @entity64 , 25 , who murdered a @entity60 pensioner and bombed three mosques as he waged a one - man race war in @entity40			1
just five days after arriving in the country last year he killed @entity277 by stabbing him three times from behind as the 82 - year - old made his way home from evening prayers			0
the ‘ evil and calculating ’ phd student – who once posed with the @entity40 ambassador when he was awarded the chance to work in @entity40 – also ordered bomb - making materials online as he plotted mass murder in a series of mosque attacks			0
guilty : @entity93 born @entity64 admitted the murder of @entity277 , 82 , who he stabbed as he walked home from a mosque , and also planting a series of bombs outside mosques horrifying : nails recovered from the scene of one of three bombings planned by murderer @entity64 crazed : @entity64 catches a bus from @entity303 to @entity304 calmly carrying a home made bomb in this green bag - incredible nobody was killed in the three bombings he planned @entity64 also admitted causing an explosion on july 12 near the @entity313 mosque in @entity314 , and engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts between april 24 and july 18 this year			0
this included planting bombs near mosques in @entity304 and @entity321 , researching locations to plant bombs and buying chemicals on the internet to make explosives .			0
