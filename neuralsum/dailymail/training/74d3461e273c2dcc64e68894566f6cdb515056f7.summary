by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity2 boss @entity1 has jumped to the defence of club president @entity4 - despite the @entity6 owner seeming to marginalise his manager in the lead up to their championship opener away at @entity11			1
@entity13 ’s quirky leadership style has come under close scrutiny since he completed his takeover of the club in april - and this week has seen him quoted in the press with comments that have n't always painted his manager in the best light			0
the @entity2 owner told @entity21 about his frequent disagreements with coaches and even said on one occasion he had told @entity1 to ' shut the f * * * up ' , before the season had even begun			1
defending the owner : @entity2 boss @entity28 says @entity4 is ' great to work with ' thanks for coming ! @entity4 sacked @entity29 shortly after taking over at @entity30 @entity1 , however , believes @entity13 will bring the good times back to the club and insists he has enjoyed a healthy relationship with the colourful @entity6 since being installed in the role in june			1
@entity4 has made wholesale changes and has delivered financial stability , but his unconventional methods , including superstitions about the colour purple and number 17 - both banned from @entity30 - remain central to the debate over whether he will be successful			1
' it ’s been great , ' @entity1 said			0
' i know there will be a bit of conjecture , but we get on fine			0
controversial : @entity4 has told players to bring own sandwiches to training and demanded they live in @entity2 and he 's gone ! @entity2 sold star striker @entity53 to @entity54 at the beginning of the summer ' the superstitions ? i do n’t wear number 17 on my back or purple ! again , there ’s a lot of stuff going out there which i appreciate you media guys have got stories to write and papers to sell or whatever			1
' but do n’t read into to it too much			0
do n’t believe everything that you read and hear on the grapevine			0
' he ’s great to work with because he ’s so passionate about the football club			0
' @entity4 and director of football @entity76 , not the head coach , identify all new signings , but @entity1 insists he has no problem with his limited role in player recruitment - despite having any player requests rejected by the owner because of his previous time at @entity85			2
@entity86 : new owner @entity4 is one to take swift decisions and does n't suffer fools new arrival : @entity2 signed striker @entity90 from @entity91 on a three - year deal ahead of the new season in action : @entity95 of @entity2 challenges @entity97 's @entity96 during a pre-season friendly ' if there ’s somebody i do n’t particularly like then i ’ll voice my concerns and they ’ll go and get the best one they can for @entity2 , ' @entity1 said			1
' that makes sense to me			0
' i think the media have had a bit of fun at @entity2 ’ expense over the last few weeks and now we ’re at the business end , so let ’s concentrate on @entity11 on saturday			2
' @entity2 are fifth favourites to drop into @entity114 under @entity4 's unconventional leadership but fans will hope @entity1 can guide them to an opening day win at @entity118 to give them a good start in the @entity120 on saturday .			2
