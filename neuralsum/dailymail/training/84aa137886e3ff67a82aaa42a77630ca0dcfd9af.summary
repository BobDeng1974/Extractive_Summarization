from right down south in @entity1 , from the capital @entity3 and from @entity5 ’s home town in @entity6 , they are arriving in @entity7 in camper vans , minibuses and beaten - up old cars			1
they are even opening up @entity12 , where the @entity13 normally takes place , to accommodate them all as they stream into the city			0
they are an invading army of @entity20 hopefuls , brought here by a desire to be present at an historic coronation			0
flights are full so the only way to be part of the show is to settle down for the long drive — two days from @entity3 — up through the country and into @entity30			0
@entity5 is carrying a nation here in @entity7 as @entity35 once did			1
as @entity47 , the 1986 @entity34 winner , wrote : ‘ as in politics , in @entity37 we are always looking for one man to save us			1
if @entity37 win , the people will crown him with laurels ; if not they will give him a crown of thorns			1
’ and it has been a mixed @entity34 so far for the world ’s greatest player			1
@entity5 carried the team through the group ; he provided the crucial assist against @entity59 in the last 16 ; he was by far the most influential player against @entity60 in the quarter - finals ; by the semi-final , though , he looked fatigued , jaded and unable to offer much energy to the team			1
focused : @entity5 , left , heads the ball during a training session in @entity67 , near @entity68 ‘ my only fear is that the kid is tired , but in the final game you can not be tired , ’ said @entity35 of his heir			1
‘ he ’ll understand that			0
even if he does n’t score , he will be the best in the world , just the same			2
’ @entity5 has had a season disrupted by a hamstring injury at @entity79			1
he does not look to have the energy levels he displayed a few years ago when @entity81 convinced him to contribute to @entity79 ’s pressing game			2
here he has been a different player , performing deeper , rather than as the farthest forward striker , and has influenced midfield			2
the semi-final against @entity86 was played in trying circumstances for the @entity37 team			1
they had woken up on the morning of the game to tragic news that @entity20 journalist @entity92 had died in a car crash in @entity94 the night before			2
@entity92 knew many of the squad and even shared a flat briefly with @entity5 in @entity79 when the player was still a teenage hopeful			1
sealed with a kiss : an @entity37 fan with a replica of the @entity34 on @entity102 in @entity7 for @entity47 , though , too much rests on one man			1
‘ how can we build a competitive team ? how can we fulfil expectations ? how can we make up for the lack of intensity , the lack of goals ? until now , the answer to all these questions has been in one man : @entity5 , ’ wrote @entity47 after the group stages			2
‘ but the name that captivates @entity20 and dazzles the world , frustrates the manager , who is trying to ensure that the team is more solid behind @entity119 , to create more options and mobility up front			2
‘ if the manager can get a collective unit playing well , then he can have confidence in the team rather than continually hoping for the inspiration from the @entity127			0
’ up for it : @entity37 fans park in a camp after arriving in @entity7 for the @entity34 final that manager , @entity132 , has stiffened up his team by bringing in @entity134 alongside @entity135 , which has brought greater defensive balance to the line - up			1
@entity139 has been a sturdy presence at the back and @entity142 , alongside him , a surprisingly calming presence			0
but it is still @entity5 who elevates this @entity37 team from being merely a good one to potential @entity34 winners , especially in the likely absence of @entity149 and the limited fitness of @entity151			1
‘ he represents 80 per cent of our creative capacity , ’ said @entity152 , the 1978 @entity34 - winning coach			2
‘ he can solve the match in just one second			0
even though the @entity156 can create more space , @entity37 enjoys the luxury of having @entity5 , which the @entity156 lack			1
’ backing : @entity20 fans with a flag of @entity35 on @entity102 that said , @entity152 has also compared @entity156 with the @entity164 side of 1970 , indicating the size of the task @entity37 face			1
‘ even after a bad season with @entity79 , @entity119 turned out to be the man at the @entity34 , ’ said @entity168 , @entity152 ’s principal striker in that 1978 @entity34 win			1
‘ he wo n’t be able to do it alone , but i ’m sure he will show his best form in the final game			0
’ while @entity175 doubts that @entity5 is at his physical peak here , he concedes that even if not at 100 per cent he could still intimidate @entity156			2
@entity178 felt similarly cowed facing @entity35 in their @entity34 quarter - final in 1986 , according to @entity180			1
‘ subconsciously , you know what you ’re up against : a phenomenal talent , ’ said @entity175			0
‘ there was a feeling if he ( @entity35 ) had a bad day then you ’ve got half a chance			2
i ’m sure it would be the same now if you played against @entity5 or @entity190			2
they score a goal a game			0
‘ the @entity156 will know that and i ’m sure they ’ll make plans for that , but it ’s hard to change your entire system for someone			2
but when i look at him at the moment , i think he ’s quite easy to mark			0
’ rivals : @entity37 and @entity30 fans ( below ) trade chants on @entity102 on saturday maybe @entity5 has done enough simply be getting to the final to satisfy the honour of @entity20			1
it is noticeable that the @entity156 , losing finalists in 2002 and semi-finalists in 2006 and 2010 , have greeted every victory here with an understated sense of satisfaction			0
for this generation of @entity156 players , only victory today will mark a job well done			0
they will not accept another glorious failure			0
‘ normally after a 7 - 1 victory you would be really happy , ’ said @entity220 ’s @entity219 following the semi-final against @entity30			0
‘ but we were all subdued			0
only the final matters to us now and that comes down to winning or losing			0
’ by contrast , @entity37 were euphoric even to win their quarter - final , ending what they regarded as a 24 - year curse of not making the last four			2
clearly their semi-final was a degree more tense than @entity156 ’s , but it has unleashed a cascade of euphoria in @entity37 , prompting the march on @entity7			1
colourful : @entity37 fans gather on @entity102 on saturday ahead of the @entity34 final @entity135 spoke of his soul soaring upon reaching the final			1
‘ we are just one little step from writing eternal history for our football , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s hard to explain and this is a unique moment			0
’ perhaps it is simply the difference in how @entity254 and @entity255 cultures express themselves , but the @entity20 have been noticeably more effusive			0
but now that the massed ranks are here , there is only one result imaginable			0
and that means one man will shoulder the responsibility			0
even @entity47 , who preaches the virtues of the team above the individual , might concede that			0
prior to the @entity34 he was asked who was the best player in the world and , of course , selected @entity5			1
and who ’s the second best , he was asked ? ‘ @entity5 injured , ’ he replied .			1
