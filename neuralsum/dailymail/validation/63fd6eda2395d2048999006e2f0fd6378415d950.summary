overly ambitious , feasible or simply just a scam - whatever your view on the @entity5 mission , it has at least inspired people to think of colonising other worlds			1
and now a sketch for the project has revealed the habitat the first astronauts on @entity12 could reside in - if they ever get there			1
it includes living quarters , a laboratory , a greenhouse and even a holodeck to give the crew the best conditions possible on the red planet			1
@entity22 cursor over the image below to zoom in @entity25 space architect @entity24 revealed his sketch for @entity5 's habitat on the red planet ( shown )			1
the concept includes living quarters , a laboratory and even a holodeck			1
there are two habitats in total , one for ' living ' ( left ) and one for ' work ' ( right )			1
credit : @entity24 / @entity38 the concept , drawn up by @entity5 's @entity40 , @entity24 from @entity25 , consists of two long cylindrical inflatable habitats - with a total area of 2,150 square feet ( 200 square metres )			1
in february 100 people - including five @entity44 - were shortlisted for the questionable @entity5 mission , which claims it will send people to live on the red planet			1
they are hoping to be chosen to be among the final crew of four who are set to begin their new lives in just 10 years time - and ultimately die on @entity12			0
the team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven - month journey from @entity54			0
' the large cut in candidates [ from 200,000 to 100 ] is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to @entity12 , ' said @entity60 , co-founder of the @entity62 @entity5 mission			1
' these aspiring @entity63 provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be			0
' the @entity69 candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews			0
they include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round			0
at the front , each has a module to which a lander can attach and the crew can enter			0
one of the habitats is designed more for living , while the other seems to be geared more towards work			2
in the residential habitat , there is a kitchen for food preparation with a total area of 320 square feet ( 30 square metres )			2
moving further into the habitat and you come to a social area of a similar area , which has a ‘ holodeck ’ to keep the crew entertained			2
this appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat , to simulate being in another environment			0
further along , are the private crew quarters , measuring about 65 square feet ( six square metres )			0
and finally , the crop section , which grows the food the astronauts will need to survive , is found at the end			0
it has a watering system and humidity controls to keep everything in working order			0
in the ‘ work ’ habitat , there is a laboratory and science section for various experiments - including an insects cabinet and biology laboratory			2
there ’s also a storage area to keep cargo , while the section is also curtailed by a crop system as well			0
@entity5 made headlines around the world in february when it revealed the final longlist of 100 applicants who will train on @entity54 for a one - way mission to the red planet in 2025			1
but the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011 - and experts have said this latest announcement does nothing to silence the sceptics			1
lack of funding , no signs of development and an overly ambitious ‘ reality tv ’ approach have all been cited as reasons that @entity5 will never be more than a pipe dream			1
‘ you have to applaud the ambition , but sadly the whole project feels very much like wing - and - a - prayer stuff when you start to look into the details , ’ @entity146 , author of @entity12 : a new view of the @entity148 , told @entity149			0
‘ they say they can put a first crew on @entity12 for $ 6 billion [ £ 3.9 billion ] , which is a shoestring budget compared to the @entity155 programme which cost $ 25 billion [ £ 16.2 billion ] - and that was in 1960s money ! ’ it could be you : pictured are some of the @entity5 hopefuls , who will be spending eight years in training ahead of what they think will be a mission to @entity12 , although the mission has been widely criticised for the lack of a feasible plan to actually get to the red planet in the sketch the habitat has a social area with a ‘ holodeck ’ to keep the crew entertained			1
this appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat , to simulate being in another environment - so it 'll likely be a bit more primitive than the holodeck used in @entity181 ( shown ) dr @entity182 from the @entity183 at the @entity184 added : ‘ ‘ there are a large number of technological considerations for safely sending a human mission to @entity12			2
‘ these include the long - term reliability of life - support systems and how to grow sufficient food and for a balanced diet , and these necessary technologies are not yet mature enough or well - tested in less risky situations - such as on a moon base			0
‘ but even the first step of securing enough large rockets to launch the mission to @entity12 has not been demonstrated by @entity5			1
’ however ceo and co-founder of @entity5 responded to the criticism , telling @entity149 he believed they ‘ have a good plan and we can overcome the challenges			2
’ later in february , though , the production company @entity206 announced they would no longer be making an accompanying tv show for the venture			0
this would have documented the training and lives of the astronauts on the red planet			1
@entity5 said they were now working with a new production company to record the colonists ’ progress			2
the latest sketch seems to be a bit different to previous concepts shown by @entity5			2
this one shows habitats and a rover on the surface			0
who will build these habitats is not quite clear , although they appear to bear some similarity to @entity231 's proposed @entity230 capsule			0

@entity25 space architect @entity24 revealed his sketch for @entity5 's habitat on the red planet
the concept includes living quarters , a laboratory , a greenhouse to grow crops and even a holodeck
there are two habitats in total in the sketch , one for ' living ' and one for ' work '
@entity5 recently revealed its ' longlist ' of candidates for the mission , but the plan has been widely criticised
the mission is still without *suitable* funding , any signs of development , a *spacecraft* or a place on a rocket launch
