police forces across the @entity1 are considering changing to new hi - tech firearms - specially designed not to kill suspects			1
departments are under severe pressure to find effective non-lethal weapons following the spate of high - profile fatal shootings by the police last year			1
two models currently being considered for use are the @entity13 and the @entity14			1
new technology : the @entity17 defender : the state - of - the - art @entity13 can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas , zapping them with a stun gun and disorientate them with a strobe light the state - of - the - art @entity13 can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas , zapping them with a stun gun and disorientating them with a strobe light , @entity25 reports			1
the @entity14 consists of a small metal ball that is clipped to the end of a normal gun			1
when the firearm is discharged , the bullet embeds itself into the orange ball as it speeds towards the target and the force of the impact is significantly lessened			1
a direct hit would be extremely painful but would be very unlikely to kill you			2
another non-lethal weapon : the @entity14 consists of a a small metal ball that is clipped on the end of a gun			1
when the gun is discharged , the bullet embeds itself into the ball as it hurtles towards the target and helps lessen the bullet 's impact the device is made by @entity54 - a direct hit is painful but would be very unlikely to kill you the picture above shows how the bullet is embedded into a ball which lessens its impact as it hurtles towards a target the efforts to develop better non-lethal weapons come after concerns over police practices following a number of lethal shootings last year			1
in august 2014 , unarmed 18 - year - old @entity68 was fatally shot by police officer @entity69 in @entity70 , @entity71 - causing months of civil unrest and protests			1
and in november , a police officer in @entity75 shot 12 - year - old @entity76 dead after the young boys was reported for waving a weapon around in a park - which turned out to be a replica firearm			1
@entity81 are believed to be considering the use of the @entity14 gun setting - to diminish the force of bullets fired			1
@entity86 , founder and ceo of @entity54 , the company that makes the device , said : ' it 's going to feel like you 're getting punched in the chest by @entity92			2
it 's going to break some ribs			2
' another company , called @entity96 , offers a variety of less - lethal ammunition than can be fired from 40mm grenade launchers			2
this includes projectiles containing pepper gas , or colored liquid to identify suspects			1
there 's also a ' malodorant round ' which contains ' a highly noxious payload that delivers an appalling odor ' - designed to disperse crowds			2
historically , tasers have been favored as the most effective non-lethal tool in a police force 's arsenal			2
but questions have been raised over the device 's safety with @entity117 claiming more than 500 people have died in the @entity1 ' after being shocked with a taser either during their arrest or while in jail '			2
a taser fires electricity into people and shocks them			0
on its website , @entity122 says its electric pulses ' affect the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system and cause incapacitation			0
' the company , @entity134 claims that the weapons do not damage vital organs , have ' been safely deployed more than 3.5 million times ' and saved 125,000 people from death or injury			0
the firm also disputes the @entity117 figure , claiming the tally of deaths directly linked to being stunned is closer to 60			0
killed by police : @entity68 , 18 , ( @entity147 ) was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer in @entity71 while 12 - year - old @entity76 ( r ) was shot dead in @entity75 by an officer while carrying a replica gun @entity122 has now provided @entity70 's police officers with body cameras			1
the @entity1 military has also been researching new non-lethal weapons - specifically a futuristic device to disperse crowds			0
developed by @entity158 , the new weapon is said to work like a giant microwave , repelling crowds by blasting them with invisible heat rays			0
@entity158 describes the device - the @entity163 - as a weapon that ' emits a focused beam of millimeter wave energy that penetrates the skin to 1/64th of an inch , producing an intolerable heating sensation that causes targeted individuals to flee '			0
@entity171 , an employee working in the development of the device , volunteered to get zapped by it on five occasions			0
she compared it to the sudden heat you would feel from opening an oven door - even though she was 3,000ft from the source of the beam			0
she told @entity25 : ' i felt an intolerable heating sensation			0
i felt its heat ramping up quickly and lasting a few brief seconds on my entire body			0
my immediate reflex was to move quickly away from the beam			0
' the @entity190 says the @entity163 insists the device is not radioactive , does not cause cancer or infertility , and can only be lethal if the beam is ' sustained and prolonged many times '			0
the weapon was deployed to @entity196 in 2010 but , aside from testing , has never been used on people .			0

police under pressure after spate of fatal shootings by officers last year
two models being considered are @entity207 and the @entity14
the defender can stop suspect with pepper gas , stun gun and strobe light
other uses metal ball to slow a speeding bulelt and lessen impact of shot
