by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:12 am on 7th february 2012 @entity3 rapper @entity2 is said to be blaming ' nerves ' and ' adrenaline ' for her controversial rude gesture during a performance at the @entity7 yesterday			1
the singer - best known for the hit song @entity10 - flipped her middle finger and swore into the camera during her rap solo as over 100 million fans around the world watched the performance			1
while all eyes were on @entity19 for a scandalous moment , the broadcasters were caught by surprise by the 36 - year - old and scrambled to obscure the gesture in time			1
rude : @entity2 flipped the middle finger during her performance with @entity19 and @entity27 at the @entity7 halftime show with one foot up on the podium , the 36 - year - old rapped : ' i do n't give a s * * * ' and pulled the rude gesture during a live performance of @entity19 's new song , @entity37 , alongside the pop queen and fellow rapper @entity27			1
the screen briefly went blurred in what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the camera shot and @entity19 , who at this point was lying on her back behind the rapper , appeared blissfully unaware of the controversial move			1
the @entity48 , which produces the show , and the broadcaster , @entity51 , both apologised immediately but blamed each other for the incident			1
too late : the screen briefly went blurred in what seemed like a late attempt to cut out the scene veteran and young guns : the singers performed their new song , @entity37 @entity62 , the league 's vice president of communications , said : ' there was a failure in @entity51 's delay system			1
@entity67 : @entity68 exposed her nipple as she performed with @entity70 at the 2004 show ' the obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate , very disappointing , and we apologize to our fans			2
' and @entity51 's spokesperson countered : ' the @entity48 hired the talent and produced the half - time show			1
' our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers			1
' @entity2 's publicists at @entity83 have not commented			2
but a member of @entity2 's camp claimed the rapper was struck with ' a case of adrenaline and nerves			1
' ' she was n't thinking , ' said the source , who requested anonymity but was with the artist at @entity94			0
" it was n't any kind of statement			0
' she was caught in the moment and she 's incredibly sorry			2
' but it may be a costly mistake - sources tell @entity102 that @entity2 may end up paying any fines imposed in the wake of the drama			2
she is said to have signed a contract with the @entity48 for the halftime performance in which she agreed to indemnify the @entity48 for any money it might be forced to pay if the @entity111 comes down on the @entity51			1
the controversy mirrors that caused by @entity68 's ' wardrobe malfunction ' during the 2004 show , which put @entity115 in hot water with the @entity111			1
the singer was performing with @entity70 when he ripped open her costume to expose her breast for nine - sixteenths of a second , a moment for which @entity115 was fined $ 550,000 by the @entity111			2
@entity70 was quick to distance himself from the furore which left @entity68 ostracised by the mainstream for some time after			0
upstage you : @entity2 and @entity19 are labelmates , and are both preparing to drop new albums the network challenged the fine and last autumn , a federal appeals court ruled against the @entity111 despite an order from the @entity133 @entity132 to review the case			1
the three - judge panel reviewed three decades of @entity111 rulings and concluded the agency was changing its policy , without warning , by fining @entity115 for fleeting nudity			2
after last night 's incident , @entity62 said that @entity2 had not done anything similar during rehearsals and the league had no reason to believe she would pull something like that during the actual show			2
@entity19 had been nervous about her performance , hoping to position herself as the queen of a new generation of pop stars with an opulent show and a sharp performance that mixed her new release with more familiar songs			1
but it seems she should have been more worried about the performance of her co-star who is no stranger to controversy			0
musical sisters : the hip hop star is a new label - mate of @entity19 's , and has just released a new video @entity165 @entity167 - born @entity2			1
- real name @entity168 - is best known for her @entity171 nominated song @entity10 - which featured in film @entity173			2
a graphic video for 2010 song @entity176 was given an adults - only rating on @entity179 and drew parallels with racism			0
@entity176 takes place in an alternate reality where people with red - hair or ' gingers ' are rounded up by @entity133 paramilitary style gang and then executed and bombed for sport			0
@entity2 defended the work and said she felt that the work of @entity191 , the teen heart - throb , was more of an assault on the senses than her video			0
the hip hop star , who gave birth to son @entity198 in february 2009 , is a new label - mate of @entity19 's , and it should come as no surprise that they both have new material to promote			1
@entity19 's @entity204 will first be issued via @entity83 when it 's released in late march			1
while @entity2 , has just released a video for her new single @entity165			0
in the video for the track she takes aim at @entity210 's laws which bans women from driving			0
courting controversy : in the video for the track she takes aim at @entity210 's laws which bans women from driving @entity217 academics warned in december that allowing women to drive would ' provoke a surge in prostitution , pornography , homosexuality and divorce '			0
and in the video , @entity2 is seen heading a crowd of dancing women dressed in traditional @entity228 dress to take part in a drag race			0
in her family 's native @entity231 she has been accused of being ' a cheerleader for terrorists ' – separatist @entity237 guerrillas – in the country 's civil war			0
as the ' only @entity241 in the western media ' @entity2 says she has a responsibility to say ' what is going on ' in the country			0
but the majority of people reportedly view the rebels as ' terrorists ' who are on the verge of being wiped out by government forces			0
and some @entity231 musicians have criticised her for ' spreading blatant terrorist propaganda '			0
@entity254 ? @entity19 put on an energetic and spectacular half time show during halftime at the @entity258 game meanwhile , @entity19 had declared she had to put on ' the greatest show on earth , during @entity261 ' and she certainly did n't disappoint			1
though she may be left more than a little put out that her labelmate has garnered the headlines today			0
the singer , 53 , put on an impressive performance during half - time show of the football game between the @entity268 and the @entity269			0
she arrived onstage like @entity271 royalty when muscle - bound men carried her extravagant throne across the football field to the stage for her opening song , @entity278			0
the @entity7 , shown on @entity51 this year , is routinely viewed by more than 100 million people , and is the biggest tv event of the year			1
still got it : @entity19 performed tricks women half her age would struggle to complete as well as her performance with @entity2 and @entity27 , she sang her way through classic hits @entity287			2
while the pressure to perform well was immense and greatly felt , @entity19 appeared to rise to the challenge and suffered just one small slip - up throughout the show			1
as she was strutting her way across the bleachers to @entity293 , the second song in her set , she was unable to step up onto one of them and had to repeat the dance move to hoist herself up			0
but @entity19 proved a true professional and laughed the error off throwing herself into the next sequence of the set			2
aside from that trivial mistake the singer put on an energetic and fun show with help from chart - toppers @entity306 , and @entity308			0
the show opened with a huge procession of @entity312 soldiers carrying a large platform as the intro to @entity278 began			0
light it up : @entity19 performed during the @entity316 at @entity94 in @entity317			2

@entity3 born rapper 's ' middle - finger malfunction ' steals the headlines from the @entity19
@entity51 apologizes for ' *spontaneous* gesture ' but blames @entity48 who ' hired the talent '
@entity48 blames @entity51 for ' failure in delay system '
