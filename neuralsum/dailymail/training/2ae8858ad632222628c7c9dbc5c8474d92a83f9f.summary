i would go months , sometimes years , without talking to family			2
i would never visit family and friends because i was so ashamed			0
i went from being a very rah - rah , outgoing , front - of - the - crowd person to being more withdrawn			2

more than 90 percent of patients who undergo weight loss surgery experience loose skin , @entity166 said			0

' as for reality weight loss shows like @entity240 said they ’re a ' total crock			0
' ' those people have every celebrity fitness trainer , every celebrity dietitian , every celebrity everything , ' he said			0
' they lose 100 pounds , they go off the show and then six months later , you see them on the red carpet somewhere enjoying their 15 minutes of fame - and they ’ve gained it all back , plus 20 pounds			0
' i ’d really just like to stress that it does not happen overnight			0
do n’t believe what you see on tv - with the magic diets and people having these weight loss surgeries and all of a sudden they ’re smaller			1
