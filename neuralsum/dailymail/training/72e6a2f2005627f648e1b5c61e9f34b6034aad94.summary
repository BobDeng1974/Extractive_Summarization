@entity0 was working punishing hours as an investment banker when a trip down to a lunch truck gave her an idea			1
if lunch could be delivered quickly and easily to her downtown @entity8 office , why could n't a manicure ? that lightbulb moment inspired her to quit her job in finance and launch @entity13 , the first on - demand mobile manicure truck catering to time - short professionals in need of a quick fix			1
based in @entity19 , a company can call to book the truck to park outside its office			1
@entity13 then pulls up curbside , and opens to employees or passers - by			2
polished : based in @entity19 , a company can call to book the @entity27 manicure truck to park outside its office			1
it then pulls up curbside , and opens to employees or passers - by ' when i was in banking i was working such crazy hours			2
i never had time to run beauty errands or do anything for myself , ' the 33 - year - old told @entity36			1
' nails were the one thing i did for myself and it was always such a hassle to take my one saturday or sunday and schlep across town to get my nails done			0
but while i was working , i would run downstairs to food trucks all the time			2
i thought to myself , if only there was a way to combine the food truck model with beauty service			1
' @entity0 put together a business plan , purchased a 26ft @entity49 trailer and even went back to beauty school to get her manicurist license			1
@entity13 was born in january 2014 and @entity0 has been on a roll ever since			1
manicures in @entity13 's pink plush interior range from $ 16 to $ 38 , with pedicures costing between $ 19 and $ 45			0
the manicures are full salon quality from top coat to base polish , and the pedicures are given ' dry ' with a hot towel wrap to soften the skin			0
lightbulb moment : @entity0 came up with the idea for @entity64 while getting a bite at a food truck			1
if lunch could be delivered quickly and easily to her office , why could n't a manicure ? ' a lot of salons skimp out			1
they 'll use the nice polish but everything else is lower quality ' @entity0 explained			2
' our products are all top - quality salon products			2
the polishes are @entity80 and @entity81			0
' up to three nail technicians are on - site at all times ready to accommodate walk ins , and @entity0 herself even pitches in			1
' i thought to myself , if only there was a way to combine the food truck model with beauty service ' ' i 'm on the trailer at all times doing work			1
i oversee the nail techs , i roll up my sleeves and do services when we 're busy			0
i check people in , i check people out , i help people pick colors			0
i also do all the finance and accounting for the business , ' she said			0
the truck is a large part of what immediately brought @entity13 attention			0
@entity0 spent a year renovating the gigantic 1960s trailer she purchased on @entity110 , and installed plush seating , pink curtains and a crystal chandelier			2
' people love the @entity49 - i think that sets us apart , ' @entity0 says			1
it was a challenge to get the power running , and getting the trailer up to the @entity121 's standards took time , but once complete , word about @entity13 traveled fast			0
retro vibe : the manicures and pedicures take place in @entity0 's 26 - foot @entity49 trailer ' @entity128 is a big place , but word travels so quickly ' @entity0 said			1
' once people started posting [ on social media ] the requests started coming in			0
' @entity13 is now regularly parked at @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			1
there 's even a waitlist for the trailer , and @entity0 has begun sending nail techs to conference rooms to perform manicure meetings			1
no additional salon services are available at the moment ( such as eyebrow waxing or massage ) , but that is definitely in phase two or three @entity0 confirmed			2
' hopefully it will all come soon , ' she says			0
' we just have the one truck at the moment			0
' trucks may eventually roll into other cities , too			0
' we 're still a young company , so i 'm trying to get us self sufficient here and then we can focus on expansion			0
' but ' expansion is definitely always in the back of my head ' @entity0 admits			2
in the meantime , she may need to hire more drivers			0
' driving the 26 - foot trailer is the craziest part of my morning , but i 've gotten used to it			0
i 'm working for myself and i love my job			0

@entity0 , 33 , came up with the idea for @entity64 while getting lunch at a food truck near her office
based in @entity19 , firms can call to book the manicure truck to park outside their offices - @entity134 , @entity136 and @entity138 are already fans
