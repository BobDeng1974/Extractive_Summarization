drama in the writer 's room : @entity3 kicked a writer out of a script - writing session after she protested a sub-plot about campus rape which aired in this week 's penultimate episode of @entity9 a writer on @entity3 's soon - to - end @entity12 series @entity9 , says she was kicked out of a script - writing session when she objected to a controversial story line about rape on college campuses which aired on this week 's episode			1
and now @entity3 , who came to fame writing @entity19 and @entity20 , says he 's ' disappointed ' writer @entity21 violated the privacy of the writer 's room			1
sunday night 's penultimate episode featured a sub-plot about a news producer dispatched to @entity28 to pre-interview a rape victim for the fictional nightly news show			1
the sub-plot 's subject matter was especially sensitive considering the timing of the episode , airing just days after @entity35 issued an apology for their ' misplacement of trust ' in a @entity40 student , whose account of being gang raped at a campus fraternity is now in question			1
the @entity9 scene follows show producer @entity46 ( played by @entity47 ) speaking with a female student who set up a website that lets rape victims like her report their attackers ' names anonymously			2
their conversation largely covers how campus rape is under - prosecuted by law enforcement and universities alike , and the journalistic ethics of reporting a rapist 's name when the suspect has not been charged			0
while @entity46 told the victim he believed her story , he finished the interview by urging her against coming on the show since he was ' morally obligated ' as a journalist to consider the rapist innocent until proven guilty in a court of law			2
viewers and critics were mostly aligned online , in their tweets criticizing @entity46 's extreme care in covering both sides of the story , which ends up silencing the victim			1
apparently @entity9 writers had a similar debate when they were writing the story months ago			2
writer @entity21 , who joined the show 's writing staff for the third and final season , revealed on @entity84 that she had been kicked out of a script - writing session when she disagreed with show creator @entity3 's decision to push forward with the rape story			1
sensative topic : the constroversial scene in question follows show producer @entity46 ( played by @entity47 , pictured ) interviewing a rape victim at @entity28 , and telling her he 's compelled to believe her attacker 's story until he 's proven guilty ' so when i tried to argue , in the writers ' room , that we maybe skip the story line where a rape victim gets interrogated by a random man ... i ended up getting kicked out of the room and screamed at , ' @entity21 wrote			1
' i found the experience quite boring			0
i wanted to fight with @entity3 about the @entity103 , not gender			0
i did n't like getting cast in this outdated role , ' she added , referring to another plot line in the episode about @entity103 leaker @entity109			0
@entity3 himself later responded to @entity21 's comments , and admitted that he did ' excuse ' her from the writing room			1
' i heard @entity21 ’s objections and there was some healthy back and forth			0
after a while i needed to move on ( there ’s a clock ticking ) but @entity21 was n’t ready to do that yet			0
i gave her more time but then i really needed to move on			0
@entity21 still would n’t let me do that so i excused her from the room , ' @entity3 told @entity124			2
however , @entity3 says he was surprised to hear @entity21 's unhappiness about the episode , since he went on to write another draft of the script that she allegedly gave her ' enthusiastic support '			1
he added that he was disappointed that @entity21 broke the confidentiality of the writer 's room by tweeting about the episode			1
' it was a room in which people felt safe enough to discuss private and intimate details of their lives in the hope of bringing dimension to stories that were being pitched			0
that ’s what happens in writers rooms and while ours was the first one @entity21 ever worked in , the importance of privacy was made clear to everyone on our first day of work and was reinforced constantly			0
i ’m saddened that she ’s broken that trust , ' @entity3 said			0
this is n't the first time @entity3 has made the news , with his show about the news			0
when @entity9 debuted in 2012 , he was largely criticized for his one - dimensional portrayal of female characters - especially a gossip reporter character he allegedly modeled off a woman he dated who worked for the @entity163 's @entity162			2
finale : @entity9 , which follows a team of journalists putting on a fictional nightly news show , will air it 's final episode next sunday			1
above , main character @entity170 , played by @entity171			0

sunday night 's episode of @entity12 show @entity9 featured a sub-plot about a character interviewing a rape victim at @entity28
the story line caused heated debate among viewers and critics , especially since the episode aired in the midst of the *current* @entity40 rape *scandal*
@entity21 , who was a writer on the show , says she objected to the story line in a script meeting with show creator @entity3
she says @entity3 , who came to fame writing @entity19 and @entity20 , kicked her out of the room when she protested the story
@entity3 responded to say he was disappointed @entity21 ' violated ' the privacy of the writer 's room
