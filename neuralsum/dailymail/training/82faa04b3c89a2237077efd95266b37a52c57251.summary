by @entity0 published : 17:12 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 17:14 est , 2 april 2013 ' people used to ask , when are you getting married ? ' @entity3 says , leaning across the table at a north @entity6 donut shop next to her wife , @entity8 , and their daughter , @entity9			2
' i always told them , " well , the entire state of @entity13 has to vote on it first			2
" ' ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 got that nod in november			2
two months after @entity13 voters approved @entity18 , the couple were legally wed in their synagogue			2
same - sex wedding : @entity3 ( second left ) and @entity8 ( second right ) had a @entity23 ceremony in @entity6 , @entity13 , on january 13 , accompanied by their daughters , @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) high school sweethearts originally from @entity29 , ms @entity8 and ms @entity9 had first been joined in a commitment ceremony in 1984 , but waited to legally marry until they could do so in their own state			1
that 's a trend among same - sex couples , says @entity35 , the @entity36 - based co-founder and editor in chief of @entity39 , an online magazine devoted to same - sex weddings			1
' as more states are legally recognizing same - sex marriage , couples are choosing to wait to marry in their home states , ' says ms @entity35			1
' we 're not seeing as many people flying to @entity48 or @entity49 for their big weddings			1
' ms @entity35 also cites a growing interest in incorporating religion into same - sex ceremonies , as ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 did			1
' for a time , there was a backlash against including religion in same - sex weddings			1
now couples seem proud to put religion and cultural traditions back into their ceremonies , ' says ms @entity35			2
there 's more freedom these days to choose a wedding that reflects a couple 's relationship and budget , according to @entity68 , author of @entity68 's @entity69			1
this generation of gays and lesbians is creating a new set of rites and rituals incorporating both old and new traditions , says mr @entity68 , who lives in @entity77 , @entity78 , a state that does n't allow same - sex marriage			1
' the maid of honor might be a man or the best man may be a woman			0
and honored attendants are often a mix of close friends and family ' he cites one new tradition of sending the rings around to be blessed by all those in attendance			1
' it 's like a metaphor for a group hug , ' says mr @entity68			1
' it 's incredibly moving			2
' today 's same - sex couples often go with non-traditional wedding party configurations			1
' the maid of honor might be a man or the best man may be a woman , ' mr @entity68 says			1
' and honored attendants are often a mix of close friends and family			0
' often the couple walk down the aisle together , ' or if they have kids , the whole family may process , ' he says			0
ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 sent their two adult daughters , @entity26 and @entity113 , down the aisle before them			0
bringing back traditions : now that gay marriage is becoming more mainstream , there is a growing interest in incorporating religion into same - sex ceremonies , as ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 did ' it was a very family wedding , ' says ms @entity8			1
' my kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and it was a crackup			0
' like these two women , many same - sex couples tying the knot are in mid-life , and have well - established relationships and children			1
while their parents may be given honored roles in the ceremony or reception , such as the first dance , many couples are planning and paying their own way			0
it remains to be seen how younger same - sex couples will structure their weddings as they marry earlier in life			1
' my kids pulled a prank on me in the middle of the ceremony and it was a crackup			0
everyone was laughing ' mr @entity68 notes that while his generation of gays and lesbians had no expectation of getting married , today 's kids are growing up expecting to have the choice			1
and just because they have the right to marry does n't mean a couple will choose to do so			0
' it 's impolite to hassle people - gay or straight - about getting married , ' he says			1
it is acceptable , he says , to ask how a same - sex couple who are getting married would like to be described			1
while many choose ' husband and husband ' or ' wife and wife , ' he says it 's a matter of respect to call them as they want			2
listen to how they refer to themselves , and follow their lead			0
bigger issues at stake : ' we did n't want it to be a political event , ' said ms @entity9 of their wedding ( pictured )			0
' but [ it ] was bigger than us , ' ms @entity8 says			0
' it 's a civil rights issue ' ' until five years ago , the standard title was " partner , " ' says mr @entity68			1
' that 's really changed			2
' while many same - sex weddings are apolitical , many other couples are passionate about politics and choose to include it in their weddings , says ms @entity35			1
ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 included a reminder of their newly gained right by involving @entity6 gay rights activist , former judge and former deputy mayor @entity196 in their ceremony , alongside rabbi @entity199			0
' we did n't want it to be a political event			0
it 's a wedding , ' says ms @entity9			2
' we did n't want it to be a political event			0
you 're being asked to show up and love a member of your family ' ' but our wedding was bigger than us , ' ms @entity8 says			0
' it 's a civil rights issue			2
' while political undertones are often present in same - sex ceremonies , mr @entity68 reminds guests , ' you 're not being asked to vote for gay marriage by choosing to attend a wedding			1
you 're being asked to show up and love a member of your family			0
' guests should decline to attend if they ca n't support the couple 's relationship , he added			2
' same - sex weddings , like straight weddings , are at their heart about love and commitment			1
if you ca n't honor the couple , please stay home			0
' ms @entity9 and ms @entity8 even bristle at the term ' gay marriage			0
' ' i do n't gay park			0
i do n't have gay lunch , ' says ms @entity8			0
' you do n't say you 're going to an interracial marriage			0
it is n't a gay marriage			0
