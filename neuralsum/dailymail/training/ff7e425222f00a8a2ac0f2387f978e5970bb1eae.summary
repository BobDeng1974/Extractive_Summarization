dark energy , the mysterious cosmic force thought to be the fuel behind the accelerating expansion of the universe , is real , according to an @entity7 - @entity6 team of astronomers			1
after a two - year study , scientists at the @entity10 in the @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity6 have concluded that the likelihood of dark energy 's existence stands at 99.996 percent			1
that 's the same level of certainty as this year 's celebrated discovery of the @entity20 , or a subatomic particle that looks very much like it , by scientists at the @entity24 research center near @entity25			2
a 2009 simulation of dark matter in the @entity28 : researcher now say they are ( almost ) certain it exists			2
although accepted by many scientists as the best explanation for why the universe is expanding at an ever - faster rate , the theory of dark energy has its skeptics			1
astronomers studying the brightness of distant supernovae over a decade ago won the 2011 @entity42 for their conclusion that the expansion of the universe was accelerating			1
but some scientists argue this is an illusion , caused by the relative movement of @entity49 in relation to the rest of the cosmos			2
others suggest shortcomings in our understanding of gravity are more likely responsible than dark energy			2
' dark energy is one of the great scientific mysteries of our time , so it is n't surprising that so many researchers question its existence , ' said @entity66 , a member of the @entity68 team involved in the research , which was published in the academic journal @entity71			1
' but with our new work , we 're more confident than ever that this exotic component of the universe is real - even if we still have no idea what it consists of			1
' a basic premise of modern cosmology is that the visible universe of stars , planets and gases makes up about 4 percent of the cosmos and is sitting like flotsam in a massive sea of unknown material referred to as dark energy			1
dark energy is thought to make up 73 percent of the cosmos , while the slightly less mysterious dark matter comprises the remaining 23 percent			0
one of the strongest pieces of evidence for dark energy is in the so - called @entity97 effect.in 1967 , @entity92 and @entity93 theorized that light from the radiation from the heat left over from the @entity101 , would become slightly more blue as it passed through the gravitational fields of lumps of matter in the universe , an effect known as gravitational redshift			1
the existence of dark energy would cause light from this residual radiation to gain energy as it travels through large lumps of mass. in 1996 , astronomers @entity114 and @entity116 suggested overlaying a map of the local universe on the picture of the residual cosmic radiation could provide clues about where to look for the effect			1
in 2003 , it was spotted , albeit weakly			0
researchers have spent decades investigating the phenomenon - but have never been able to prove it actually exists			0
it was seen as supporting evidence for dark energy and hailed as the ' @entity130 ' in @entity131			0
but some scientists argued it could have been caused by cosmic dust and questioned the discovery			0
the @entity7 - @entity6 team that carried out the latest study was led by @entity114 and @entity138			1
they re-examined all the arguments against the detection and have improved the maps used in the original work			0
they conclude that dark energy is almost certainly responsible for the hotter parts of the cosmic microwave background			0
' we have methodically addressed all of these issues and concluded none of them can explain the observations we see , ' @entity148 told @entity154			0
' in the end , the only remaining explanation is dark energy - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's probably a duck			0
' radio telescopes like the huge @entity163 that will be sited in remote areas in @entity165 and @entity166 , should improve the tricky process of measuring distances in the universe and give more definitive data , he said			2
" what dark energy could be , theoretically , is another question , " @entity148 said .			0

@entity11 and @entity6 team say the fuel *believed* to be expanding the universe is real
however , they admit they still have no idea what it consists of
