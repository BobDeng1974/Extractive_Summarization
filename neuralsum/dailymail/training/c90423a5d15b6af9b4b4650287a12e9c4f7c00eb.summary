by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 , pictured here with her children , has suggested girls should ditch university and focus on becoming a mother when it comes to domestic matters , she has always been outspoken			2
but @entity2 ’s latest advice to girls to forget university and concentrate on having babies first has attracted howls of outrage			0
she said that rather than go to university , young women should focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘ falls off a cliff ’ at 35			1
the 42 - year - old television presenter – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – said if she had a daughter she would give her this advice : ‘ i would say , “ @entity26 , do you know what ? do n’t go to university			1
start work straight after school , stay at home , save up your deposit – i ’ll help you , let ’s get you into a flat			0
and then we can find you a nice boyfriend and you can have a baby by the time you ’re 27			2
” ’ the @entity39 , who has been in a relationship with property developer @entity42 for ten years , said it is time to speak ‘ frankly ’ about fertility			1
‘ at the moment , women have 15 years to go to university , get their career on track , try and buy a home and have a baby			2
‘ that is a hell of a lot to ask someone			0
as a passionate feminist , i feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue			2
do n’t go to university because it ’s an “ experience ”			0
no , it ’s where you ’re supposed to learn something ! do it when you ’re 50 ! ’ however , her comments in a newspaper interview yesterday attracted fierce criticism			1

’ conservative mp @entity79 described miss @entity80 as a ‘ bit 1950s ’			1
and psychologist dr @entity83 said : ‘ it seems quite an antiquated idea that because we have ovaries , we should n’t have a career			0
i think this is telling girls to not do what is the most important thing at that age , which is to invest in your education , become self - sufficient			1
‘ it ’s certainly not advice i would give my daughter			0
’ miss @entity80 – who did not go to university – divided opinion among her 348,000 followers on @entity101			1
some called her ‘ stuck in the past ’ but others agreed with her			0
