@entity1 's biggest bank @entity0 has been dragged into yet another potential scandal over claims that it set up offshore accounts in @entity6 for suspected drug - dealers and fraudsters			1
@entity9 launched an investigation after a whistleblower leaked details of £ 700million allegedly held in more than 4,000 accounts hidden in the island tax haven			1
many of the account - holders are now being probed for tax evasion , while @entity0 could face sanctions from regulators if it is found not to have flagged up suspicious deposits to the @entity6 authorities			1
scandal : @entity0 is accused of setting up thousands of accounts in @entity6 for clients that include drugs and arms dealers the latest revelations come just months after it emerged that @entity0 allowed rogue states and drug cartels to launder billions of pounds through subsidiaries in the @entity33 and @entity34			1
it is expected to face fines of up to £ 1billion over the affair			2
tax accountant @entity38 , a long - time campaigner against @entity6 ’s tax haven status , said the leaked @entity0 accounts could be the tip of the iceberg , claiming : ‘ i do n’t see any reason why @entity0 is worse than any other bank in @entity6			1
’ but he added of @entity0 : ‘ this bank was clearly out of control			0
it confirms what we ’ve begun to realise , that this is a bank that was , during the period that the @entity51 lord @entity51 was in charge , the world ’s biggest money - launderer			2
’ former chairman @entity51 , an ordained priest in the @entity55 , is now a trade minister in the @entity57 government			0
idyllic : @entity6 serves as a tax haven where thousands of @entity0 customers have their cash			1
@entity62 is alleged to have deposited more than £ 2 million in an account there those whose account details were leaked to @entity9 are said to include @entity67 , a suspected drug - dealer now living in @entity68			1
mr @entity67 refused to return from @entity69 , allowing his father , @entity70 , to be tried and convicted alone after police found £ 500,000 of cannabis at his farm in 2006			1
@entity0 was founded as the @entity74 in 1865 to help finance trade links between @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
the inspiration came from @entity81 @entity80 , who worked for shipping giant @entity82 and saw the demand in @entity85 banking facilities			0
it began building up branches in @entity88 and printed @entity90 's first banknotes after being the first bank to open there in 1888			0
recession and political turmoil in the 1930s caused uncertainty and most of the bank 's staff became prisoners of the @entity101 during the @entity102			0
but out of the ashes it rebuilt itself on large reserves built up in peace time and was central to rebuilding @entity108 's economy			0
in the 1970s it began to focus more on strategies for the @entity1 , buying @entity111 in 1992 and then making them @entity0 in 1999 with a huge re-branding			2

while most of the accounts are held by rich @entity135 bankers and professionals , others were said to have been opened by people with no obvious legal source of wealth			2
@entity140 , @entity6 ’s chief of financial regulation , said he would ‘ robustly ’ investigate whether rules had been breached but said tax evasion was ‘ ultimately a police matter ’			1
he insisted that @entity6 co-operates with other nations but said it had no plans to adopt the system used by most @entity76 countries , who automatically pass on financial data about non-residents to their home tax authority			1
but mr @entity38 said : ‘ what ’s the only reason to offer someone the chance not to tell the tax authorities what they ’re earning ? it ’s because you know the person you ’re dealing with is a tax evader			0
’ @entity0 said of the leaked list : ‘ we are investigating the reports of an alleged loss of certain client data in @entity6 as a matter of urgency			1
‘ we have not been notified of any investigation in relation to this matter by @entity9 or any other authority but , should we receive notification , we will co-operate fully with the authorities			2
@entity0 remains fully committed to adoption of the highest global standards including the procedures for the acceptance of clients			0
’ @entity9 said : ‘ we can confirm we have received the data and we are studying it			2
