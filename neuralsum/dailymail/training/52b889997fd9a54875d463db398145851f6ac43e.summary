spectacular images that show how a summer park becomes a lake each spring complete with underwater trees have been captured by two divers			1
the snaps were taken at the @entity6 , or @entity7 as it is called in @entity8 , located in the southern @entity10 province of @entity11			1
during the summer and late winter the lake , located near the town of @entity14 at the foot of the snow - capped @entity17 mountains , is only around three feet deep and the surrounding area is part of the country park			0
trees have adapted to being underwater for upwards of a month every year at a time , with the water typically around 40 feet deep through most of the spring			0
and as these spectacular images show it creates an eerie landscape which in the crystal clear waters flooding down from the melting ice and snow still allow the light to filter onto the grass and shrubs below			2
the images show how a summer park becomes a lake each spring complete with underwater trees trees have adapted to being underwater for upwards of a month every year at a time , with the water typically around 12 - metres - deep through most of the spring two of @entity10 's leading underwater photographers , @entity61 and @entity63 , photographed the unique underwater landscape the @entity66 fish in @entity67 find their way to the underwater forest to join the trees in a little piece of paradise the photographs are part of the project to highlight @entity10 's investment in making sure it 's rivers , streams and lakes remain crystal clear and unpolluted			1
they are being shown at a new under water world exhibition at the @entity83 in the southern city of @entity85 to highlight the country 's aquatic beauty spots			0
the inhabitants of the @entity10 forest have to adapt as the snow melts and the landscape becomes underwater zebra mussels take advantage of the changing landscape as they flourish when the snow melts and river levels rise a school of common bleaks in @entity99 ; these spectacular images show an eerie landscape is created when water meets forest two of @entity10 's leading underwater photographers , @entity61 and @entity105 , also captured some of the plants and animals beneath the underwater lake which can now be seen at the photography exhibition			2
exhibition curator @entity111 said : ' many people are surprised that images like these have been captured in @entity10 rather than in somewhere more exotic like the @entity114 but we really do have a beautiful aquatic landscape that is perhaps sometimes overlooked against the backdrop of the country 's other natural wonders			0

the melting snow means the water level of the @entity6 in @entity10 rises higher than trees and rocks
two divers capture *incredible* underwater *scenes* as park is *transformed* into underwater landscape
*heralded* as a beauty spot highlighting the pollution - free waters of the province of @entity11
