by @entity0 he follows in the rather large footsteps of notable @entity3 of yesteryear , notably @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 ... so just who is senator @entity11 ? he has had the defence portfolio for a year now but not much is known about him except , according to his web page , that he 's 58 , was born in @entity14 , lives in @entity15 with his wife @entity16 and three adult children			1
most recently , however , he 's been dragged into the debate over whether @entity14 would deploy troops to @entity20 , clearly at odds with the prime minister			2
@entity23 will not rule the possibility out , a stance which has irked his defence minister			2
most would be able to name @entity29 ( @entity14 's foreign minister , second from left ) and @entity31 ( @entity33 secretary of state , second from right ) but who are the other two ? far left is @entity14 's defence minister , @entity11 and far right , @entity33 defence secretary , @entity38			1
senator @entity11 lists his interests as being cycling , sailing on the @entity42 and that he is ' an avid @entity43 supporter ' but he also tops a list of little - known or anonymous ministers in the @entity46			1
there are more than 2 million businesses registered in @entity14 , @entity47 is the minister for small business			2
he has just over 4000 followers to his @entity53 account			0
if you think that is a low count for a government minister , then @entity54 is the deputy prime minister and just 3,500 bother to read his tweets			1
guess who ? from left to right : @entity47 ( @entity61 ) , senator @entity62 ( minister for veterans affairs ) and senator @entity63 ( human services minister ) curiously , the @entity66 shares the name of a famous type of bridge , the ' @entity54 ' was patented in 1848 , it consists of longitudinal and angled cross-members			1
@entity11 ( defence minister ) @entity54 ( deputy prime minister ) @entity71 ( health minister ) @entity73 ( finance minister ) @entity47 ( small business minister ) @entity62 ( @entity75 ) @entity63 ( human services minister ) perhaps his greatest claim to fame though is how he came to , bizarrely , rate a mention in the popular tv series ' @entity82 ' , a few years back			1
in one episode one of the main characters , @entity84 , is challenged over the apparent headbutting of the ' honourable @entity54 , minister for agriculture '			2
his @entity89 counterpart , @entity88 put it bluntly			1
' no one knows who @entity54 is , that 's because he 's not doing anything , ' mr @entity88 said			1
he 's not the only one suffering from an identity crisis with voters			0
@entity97 mp @entity71 is a former police officer who scored the plum dual roles of minister for health and @entity100			0
he did make a name for himself four years ago though , when he refused to attend parliament for the official apology to the ' @entity104 ' by then prime minister @entity105			0
@entity106 - born senator @entity73 may be well thought of within @entity107 ranks but is hardly a household name as minister for finance			0
he visited @entity15 in 1994 after learning @entity110 during a one - year exchange program in @entity112 , migrating to @entity14 a short time after			0
little - known finance minister @entity73 did come to some prominence when he shared a cigar with treasurer @entity116 after the budget ' given @entity116 's performance this past week , if he 's the best they 've got it 's in the government 's interest for people not to know who the ministers are , ' mr @entity88 added			1
' perhaps on the other hand , the government should promote some of these no - name ministers , they 'd have to be able to do a better job than @entity116 , @entity23 and the other so - called big names			1
' @entity133 senator @entity62 , 60 , is also on the list			0
he worked as a barrister and solicitor in @entity137 before choosing a political career			0
he 's now the minister for veterans ' affairs			0
@entity89 mp @entity88 did not mince words , suggesting the ' no - name ministers ' should be given a chance to enhance their public credentials because ' they 'd do a better job than @entity116 and @entity23 ' on paper they are three government ministers of note ( left to right ) @entity54 ( deputy pm ) , @entity71 ( health minister ) and @entity73 ( finance minister ) @entity151 ( 1931 - 32 ) @entity152 ( 1939 - 41 ) @entity153 ( 1941 - 45 ) @entity154 ( 1969 - 71 ) @entity5 ( 1975 - 82 ) @entity6 ( 1984 - 90 ) @entity8 ( 1990 - 96 ) @entity7 ( 2001 - 06 ) @entity9 ( 2010 - 13 ) we know that @entity63 , who has the @entity157 portfolio , has just moved into a newly built home in @entity159 and ' cooks for therapy '			1
@entity11 graduated with a law degree from the @entity163 in 1979			0
at the same time @entity5 was midway through his tenure as one of the longest serving @entity3 in @entity14 's history			2
@entity11 entered politics as a member of the @entity170 in 2002 after a career as a barrister			0
he had earlier made an unsuccessful bid to enter the @entity174 during the 1987 election , when the lost @entity177 race to @entity178			0
@entity11 had served in the shadow defence role under @entity154 and @entity23 from 2010 , taking over the ministry when the @entity107 won power last year			1
other prominent ministers to have occupied the portfolio include former @entity89 leader @entity6 ( 1984 - 1990 ) and @entity9 ( 2010 - 2013 ) .			2

@entity14 senator @entity11 has the key portfolio of defence
@entity54 is *arguably* better known as the name of a type of bridge and his mention in tv series ' lost ' than as deputy pm
as @entity23 and @entity116 *hog* the *headlines* , very little is known of some others in *pivotal* *cabinet* roles
@entity89 mp @entity88 says ' it 's in the government 's best interests for people not to know who these ministers are '
