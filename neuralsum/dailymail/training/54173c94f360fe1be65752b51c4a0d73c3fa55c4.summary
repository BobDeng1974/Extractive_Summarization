by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 05:30 est , 26 december 2012 plans to allow grands prix and motor races to be held on @entity5 roads are being considered by government ministers			1
towns in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have all expressed an interest in holding road races with proposals to scrap laws that require race organisers to get special dispensation from @entity17 to hold a event being drawn up			1
under the proposals , which will be revealed in a formal consultation , plans for road races would only have to be approved by local authorities			2
proposals : scenes like this could be coming to a street near you with the government considering changing the law to make it easier to hold races and grands prix on @entity5 streets current laws require a suspension of the @entity37 for a race to be held on a public highway			1
speed limits would be legally lifted under the plans			0
should the move be agreed , towns and cities in the @entity5 could follow the lead of cities such as @entity47 and @entity48 which famously hold races on the @entity51 calendar			1
towns in west @entity53 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity8 and the @entity54 are all understood to have expressed an interest in holding events , with @entity57 hoping to hold an environmentally friendly race			1
