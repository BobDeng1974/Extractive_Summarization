by @entity0 published : 03:16 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 02:54 est , 21 december 2012 @entity2 chairman @entity1 faced renewed calls to resign yesterday after he accused a parliamentary committee of ‘ shabby ’ treatment when it criticised ex-director - general @entity7 ’s bumper payoff			1
the @entity9 peer clashed with @entity11 mp @entity10 , chairman of the @entity12 , over a report which attacked the ‘ cavalier ’ use of public money to give mr @entity7 a ‘ reward for failure ’ after a mere 54 days in the job			1
@entity1 accused @entity19 of ‘ taking no notice ’ of 12 pages of legal advice the @entity23 had supplied – which he said showed it would have faced a bigger payout had they not agreed the deal			1
defence : @entity23 chairman @entity1 has maintained that the package was a good deal for taxpayers in a scattergun approach , he attacked mps , the @entity36 and the @entity37 , and said his hands were tied by the corporation ’s lawyers			1
he suggested some newspapers , naming the @entity42 and @entity43 , were overly critical of the payout although he seemed finally to accept that mr @entity7 was the ‘ wrong man ’			1
on mr @entity7 ’s appointment to the job of director general , he added : ‘ with the benefit of hindsight , we chose the wrong one			1
but we chose him from a very distinguished field			0
' it was the unanimous choice of the whole of the @entity23			2
’ he defended the @entity2 ’s approach to the @entity58 scandal – saying it had acted more swiftly than the @entity59 in response to the revelations about the tv presenter ’s sordid past			2
the @entity36 , which has received allegations from former patients at three trusts , has still to start formal inquiries into what went wrong			0
miss @entity10 said the @entity2 chairman should accept there might be ‘ different views ’ about his decision to rush through a generous deal with mr @entity7 , adding : ‘ he may not be right			1
’ she pointed out that there had been a culture of generous settlements to former executives , including former chief operating officer @entity79 who received £ 670,000 earlier this year after she was passed over for the director general ’s job			2
‘ they just do n’t get it , ’ she said			0
scandal : @entity7 ( left ) was paid £ 450,000 to leave the @entity2 after 54 days in the job - which @entity12 chairman @entity10 ( right ) says was an unacceptable ( amount ) senior @entity11 backbencher @entity88 said he was shocked by @entity1 ’s comments , saying the remarks ‘ merits his resignation ’			1
last month mr @entity7 was given a full year ’s salary – £ 450,000 – double what he was entitled , to ensure a speedy resignation amid the crisis caused by @entity97 ’s dropped @entity99 investigation and the botched report which wrongfully linked @entity101 to the abuse of children			2
his deal also provided a year ’s private healthcare , fees for lawyers and even £ 10,000 to pay for press advice			1
the @entity12 said the deal was ‘ out of line both with public expectations and what is considered acceptable elsewhere in the public sector ’			2
mps also criticised ‘ excessive ’ severance payments to ten other senior managers , including miss @entity79			2
on @entity118 ’s today programme , the @entity2 chairman said : ‘ you are not supposed to criticise the @entity12 ... in politics it is sort of the equivalent of swearing in church			0
the @entity12 - ‘ i do think the treatment we have had from them is a bit shabby			0
’ @entity36 over @entity129 - ‘ it has to be said that the @entity2 has moved to tackle all this more rapidly than some of the other institutions in the country – hospitals and so on ...			2
’ press speculation that @entity99 report was pulled to protect tribute programmes - ‘ i was quite surprised by the fact that there was newspaper after newspaper making that allegation			0
’ @entity79 ’s £ 670,000 payoff - ‘ she negotiated her departure with the executive			0
it is not an issue which the trust has the responsibility of dealing with			0
’ agreeing @entity151 payoff - ‘ the legal advice we had was that if we fought it we would fetch up with a bigger bill			0
’ ‘ but i do think the treatment we have had from them is a bit shabby			0
i do not think they have been fair because they did not look at our legal arguments at all			0
’ in a question to commons leader @entity163 , mr @entity88 said @entity1 ’s accusation of ‘ shabby ’ treatment ‘ merits his resignation ’			0
@entity1 said legal advice pointed out if the @entity23 had not made the settlement to mr @entity7 ‘ there and then ’ it would have probably ended up having to pay out for constructive and unfair dismissal claims			1
he said he knew and liked miss @entity10 , ‘ but i do n’t think this is a fair way of treating us ’			0
miss @entity10 told the @entity42 yesterday that her committee ‘ did give them a fair hearing ’ and said the @entity23 ‘ called it wrong ’ by not letting the @entity174 look at the deal			1
‘ i think they do n’t understand that the public really do get irate when they see their licence fee being used on such big handouts which are rewards for failure			0
’ the mp said she did still not understand the whole package of mr @entity7 ’s deal and did not know if his pension was based on what he was earning for the 54 days as @entity2 chief			1
she said the committee was ‘ gobsmacked ’ and ‘ astounded ’ when it was revealed what was in his exit package			0
@entity1 said the @entity2 has taken legal advice on whether it can recoup some of the £ 450,000 payoff given to mr @entity7 , but was not hopeful			1
decision : @entity1 and the @entity23 chose @entity7 for the @entity198 's top job - but it was a terrible mistake he admitted			1

@entity7 was paid to leave the @entity2 in *november* after 54 days in the job
he was also handed private healthcare for a year , legal fees and a pr *budget* as part of the deal
@entity23 chair @entity1 says they are looking into getting some of the @entity211 money back after *damning* @entity213 review
the peer also admits he chose the wrong man when he employed him as director - general
mps looking at the pay - off said it was an ' unacceptable use of public money '
@entity11 's @entity10 goes to war with @entity2 over pay and gold - *plated* benefits of its senior staff
