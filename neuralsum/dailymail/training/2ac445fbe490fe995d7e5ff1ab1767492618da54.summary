scandal : ex leader of the @entity2 , @entity3 , was jailed for child sex offences , and claimed today that ' @entity5 and co ' made no effort to remove him or other members fresh questions emerged today about how influential a despised paedophile group were in the civil liberties organisation that @entity12 helped run before she became an mp			1
the former leader of the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) said the @entity15 and the @entity16 of @entity17 ( @entity18 ) made ' no attempts ' to ' kick out ' his group			1
@entity3 , who has been convicted of a number of child sex offences and was described as ' one of the most infamous perverts on @entity25 ' , sat on the @entity18 's gay rights sub-committee in the late 1970s			1
in the eight years @entity2 was given affiliate status , @entity3 said he spoke at the @entity18 's 1977 @entity29 conference , two years after he helped lead a campaign to cut the age of consent to as low as ten			1
today he told the @entity33 that ms @entity12 and @entity34 , then general secretary of the @entity18 , and later a @entity15 health secretary , ' did n't even try ' to remove him or other members because they ' did n't want to rock the boat ' to protect their own careers			1
' really they did n't do much to oppose @entity2 's presence in my view because there were these other liberal forces , or radical forces , within @entity18 , ' he told the @entity48			1
' the support did n't come from @entity5 and co but it was there			0
the gay liberation front was very radical and at that time @entity5 and @entity34 could n't just kick out @entity2 , well they could both try but they did n't even try and the reason they did n't try is they did n't want to rock the boat because their careers within @entity18 depended on them not rocking the boat too much			1
he said : ' i spoke to her when we were just going up a floor or two in a lift and she was somewhat frosty			2
' i said something to her , i think as a pleasantry , and she did n't take it that way			0
she said that i 'd been rude to her afterwards , which i had n't been			0
' my impression was that she simply had great distaste for being in the same lift as me			0
' his comments were rubbished today by people including , @entity69 , who said the convicted paedophile has no credibility			2
mr @entity69 said in a statement : ' quite simply , no one will believe a man like @entity3			2
' big players : @entity12 once legal officer of the @entity18 , now @entity15 deputy leader and husband @entity69 , right , a left - wing firebrand , now a shadow minister @entity3 was not the only prominent member to find themselves in court charged with appalling sex offences			1
they included @entity103 , a member of its governing committee , prosecuted for indecent assault , child rape and possession of 1,129 indecent images of children			0
@entity34 : general secretary of the @entity18			2
@entity3 said he met her in a lift but never met mr @entity69 or ms @entity12 they also included @entity114 , a prep school teacher and @entity2 organiser jailed in @entity116 for sexual corruption and sex with a minor ; @entity120 , a former chairman , who was jailed for possessing indecent images ; and @entity123 , a co-founder			1
@entity12 belatedly expressed ‘ regret ’ yesterday that the vile paedophile group was allowed to forge links with the @entity18			1
but she still refused to apologise over the @entity18 ’s extraordinary relationship with the notorious @entity2			2
@entity15 ’s deputy leader has repeatedly resisted calls to comment on the @entity132 ’s revelations that she , her mp husband @entity69 and former health secretary @entity34 held key roles in the pressure group that granted ‘ affiliate ’ status to @entity2 , a group of predatory paedophiles who openly campaigned to legalise child sex			1
on monday evening , miss @entity12 dismissed the revelations as a ‘ politically - motivated smear campaign ’			0
but hours after a disastrous @entity143 appearance she abruptly changed tack			0
faced with questions over why she found it so difficult in the interview to condemn the link with @entity2 – who wanted the age of consent to be four – miss @entity12 issued a statement yesterday through her spokesman , who said : ‘ she regrets the existence of @entity2 and she regrets their involvement with @entity18 before she joined , although it was immaterial to her work			1
’ document : this is the cover page of the @entity18 's submission to @entity161 on the 1976 @entity162 held at the @entity164 library , which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14 damning : on page six of the document it is argued that ' a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent ' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten ' if the child understood the nature of the act ' former culture secretary @entity176 has said ms @entity12 had been a lifelong feminist and ' was n't chasing wacky causes ' during the 1970s			1
she told today : ' @entity12 , @entity69 , were completely consistent in their opposition to the vile influence of the @entity2			1
' ms @entity176 said there was ' not one shred of evidence that they gave any comfort to this revolting organisation '			0
she added : ' there 's no question of post-hoc justification here			0
the evidence shows how vigorous @entity69 was in his attack on the @entity2			2
' @entity12 's work at @entity18 did n't bring her into contact with them at all			1
' 1978 briefing : the @entity18 legal officer @entity12 wrote this briefing paper on the @entity198 , which sought to ban child pornography			1
she argued that it would lead to an ' increase in censorship ' argument : the second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed recommendations : miss @entity12 's briefing went on that the @entity18 would argue that the @entity210 to protect children should be amended signed : the @entity15 deputy leader 's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered @entity69 has spoken out for the first time and said he is ' proud ' of his support for a controversial civil liberties organisation in the 1970s			1
he also said that he led the fight to stop paedophiles having any influence in it			0
mr @entity69 said he chose to stay within the civil liberties organisation and led the fight against paedophile attempts to infiltrate it			2
he said : ' i took them on and defeated them			0
they published a leaflet denouncing me			0
' asked why he did n't simply resign from the @entity18 when the @entity2 became involved , he said he believed it was important to stay and fight them			2
' i stayed and took them on			0
' i 'm proud of the stand that i took			0
and i 'm proud of the stand that i took taking them on			0
' so the idea that we should allow these sinister men , and they were sinister , to infiltrate the @entity18 and then we should walk away - that was not appropriate			0
' @entity18 did outstanding work			0
that includes the early foundations of work on children 's rights			0
' the @entity132 revealed that during the 1970s and 80s , the @entity18 described @entity2 – granted formal ‘ affiliate ’ status from 1975 to the mid-eighties – in glowing terms as ‘ a campaigning / counselling group for adults attracted to children ’			2
agm minutes : this page reveals how the @entity2 was represented at an @entity265 at the @entity266			0
below the list of organisations present is @entity69 's name , after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the @entity18 in 1977 the @entity18 – now the respected @entity18 – filed a submission to @entity161 claiming that ‘ childhood sexual experiences , willingly engaged in , with an adult , result in no identifiable damage ’			1
@entity18 lawyers also acted for @entity2 members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour			2
ms @entity34 was general secretary of the @entity18 from 1974 - 83			1

mr @entity69 sat on the @entity18 executive committee from 1970 to 1979			1
police are investigating @entity2 as part of @entity283 , launched after the @entity285 affair , with one source saying there is evidence that @entity2 members were abusing children ‘ on an industrial scale ’			0
the @entity291 is also carrying out a ‘ thorough , independent investigation ’ into shocking claims that the @entity15 government of the 1970s may have helped finance the notorious group			0
ever since december , when @entity132 first investigated the @entity18 ’s links to the paedophile lobby , we have been sending detailed questions to @entity5 , @entity300 and mr @entity69 about their links to @entity2 and whether they now regret supporting such a group .			1
