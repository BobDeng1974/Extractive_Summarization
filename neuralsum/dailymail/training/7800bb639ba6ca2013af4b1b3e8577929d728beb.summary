a @entity1 angler got the surprise of his life when he discovered the mysterious fish he had just caught had human - looking teeth			1
bringing a new meaning to the phrase ' getting a bite ' , @entity8 thought he had caught a simple common bream until a closer inspection revealed the fish had large incisors bearing an uncanny resemblance to those found in a human mouth			1
' we know @entity8 can tell some tall tales but when he came in and said he had a fish with human teeth we thought he 'd certainly been drinking , ' his friend @entity54 said			2
' but then he got it out and we were totally shocked ... none of us had ever seen anything like it in our lives , ' the 60 - year - old added			0
mr @entity8 initially believed the fish to be a common bream and was considering discarding it as the animal was already dead when he caught it			1
but as it still smelt fresh , mr @entity8 decided to inspect the fish more closely in the hope of working out how long ago it had died			0
it was upon doing so that he discovered its unusual teeth			0
experts at the @entity76 believe the fish is some sort of vegetarian piranha surprise : @entity8 initially dropped the fish after spotting its human - like teeth			1
he quickly regained his composure , however , and rushed off the show his friends at the local pub comic : when his friends heard @entity8 ( pictured ) had caught a fish with human teeth on the @entity49 , their initial reaction was to assume it was just another one of his many jokes after showing the fish to his friends , mr @entity8 contacted the @entity76 for their expert opinion on the mysterious creature			1
institute expert @entity96 said : ' we had to do an autopsy and carry out a series of examinations to determine the species and an explanation for the teeth			0
' we are convinced it is a member of the @entity106 , and that it is a herbivore piranha - not one of the meat eating ones you see in films			0
' it is very unlikely that it made its way from its natural tropical waters to our @entity117 and then into the river , so we can only assume it was dumped by an owner of exotic fish , ' he added			0
for his part mr @entity8 is simply happy to have proved his cynical friends wrong , saying : ' i do n't think people will be doubting my fishing stories again after this			2
