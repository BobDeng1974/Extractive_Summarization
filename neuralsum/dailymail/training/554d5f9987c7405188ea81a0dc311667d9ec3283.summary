by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 23:05 est , 24 february 2014 @entity4 : 07:58 est , 25 february 2014 @entity7 mp @entity6 's constituency home was raided by police last year a conservative mp was questioned by police over an alleged benefits fraud , it emerged last night			1
@entity6 's home was raided by police as part of a year - long inquiry into whether his elderly mother - in - law ’s assets were deliberately concealed during her time in a care home			1
today the mp for @entity19 insisted he is ' totally innocent ' of allegations of benefit fraud			2
he also criticised both the county council and the police force over their handling of the case			0
@entity26 refused to be drawn on the case , pending the outcome of the legal investigations			0
mr @entity6 was questioned in relation to a dispute with @entity32 about the funding of residential care for his mother - in - law , @entity35 , which is currently the subject of a civil court case			1
the @entity39 reported that questions were asked about concerns that the council was not given accurate information about mrs @entity35 's assets before providing benefits totalling around £ 100,000			1
anyone with assets of more than £ 23,250 is expected to pay their own care home fees			1
in november , a file was sent to the @entity51 , which will decide whether there is enough evidence to lay charges			1
last night mr @entity6 , who denies any wrongdoing , told the @entity56 he was facing a ‘ personal nightmare at the hands of the police ’			1
he said that today he will complain to the @entity51 about the way he had been treated			2
mr @entity6 said : ' ultimately , the issue at the heart of this dispute is very simple : either @entity64 and i have looked after her mother properly , or we are devious , thieving , crooks			1
' i know the answer to that question and based on all the evidence , which they have , they should know too that we are totally innocent			0
' mrs @entity35 has lived in a private care home for seven years but for part of that time , some of the fees were paid by @entity32			2
the local authority is supposed to pay care fees only if the person has assets of less than £ 23,250			1
the police acted over concerns that mrs @entity35 had just sold a house and therefore should have been paying the full amount for her care because she had assets			1
there is no suggestion that she acted improperly			0
@entity90 said a 61 - year - old man had been interviewed under caution in april ‘ in connection with alleged fraud offences ’			2
@entity6 and his wife @entity64 pictured at home			2
he has denied any wrongdoing mr @entity6 said he accepted there was ‘ a dispute regarding part of the care home fees ’ , and that his family have paid ‘ substantial funds ’ towards the fees			1
‘ it is absolutely untrue that any of mrs @entity35 ’s assets were hidden , ’ he said			1
‘ they were all declared on the appropriate forms to the county council and this has never been challenged			0
there is no shortfall to the county council for £ 100,000			0
' mr @entity6 added : ‘ since march last year , my wife and i have been living through a surreal nightmare – two people who have always supported and respected the police , who have had their belief shattered			1
’ the mp denied the council ’s claims and said a civil case with it was ongoing			2
he has written to the chief constable of @entity90 about the handling of the case			0
mr @entity6 is one of the @entity127 ’ most colourful characters , often referring to ‘ @entity129 ’ when posing questions to ministers			1
he so regularly phrases questions to @entity133 as being on her behalf that the prime minister once told the @entity127 that ‘ a very big part of my life is trying to give pleasure to @entity129 ’			0
asked about the allegations today , the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ‘ i think there 's a process going forward here with the appropriate authorities and that 's what should be followed			2
’ mr @entity6 said the ‘ most hurtful ’ aspect of the affair was the suggestion that the couple may have ‘ stolen ’ his mother - in - law 's money			1
he pointed to a sworn affidavit in which she made clear she had signed over power of attorney so that her money could be used by her daughter ‘ to pay off personal debts incurred while she was ill and towards my grandson 's school fees , as well as care home fees and personal expenses ’			2
a @entity90 spokeswoman said : ‘ a 61 - year - old man was formally interviewed under caution in april 2013 in connection with alleged fraud offences			0
‘ a police file was submitted to the @entity51 in november 2013 and we await their decision			2
’ a spokesman for @entity32 said : ‘ we have read the comments made by @entity6 and contest many points he has made			0
‘ because of ongoing legal considerations we can not comment on this matter any further			0
’ the @entity51 said in a statement : ‘ in november 2013 , the @entity51 received a file from @entity90 concerning a 61 - year - old man formally interviewed under caution in april 2013 in connection with alleged fraud offences			1
‘ we will reach a decision in this case as soon as is practicable			0
’ it is estimated that around 20,000 pensioners a year sell their homes to pay for their own care			0
under @entity192 rules , the majority of pensioners with assets worth more than £ 23,250 must fund their own care - including practically everyone who owns property			1
councils carry out assessments on people who are taken into care , and those who exceed the cap must contribute to costs			0
between £ 14,250 and £ 23,250 the cost is shared with councils , but above the threshold it is entirely up to those in care			1
below £ 14,250 , councils will still draw on a resident 's income but will not touch their assets			2
councils are required to leave those in care with just £ 23.50 of their own each week to spend			0
there are exceptions to the rules if a stay turns out to be temporary , and for those who have mental illnesses			0
recently councils have become more willing to investigate the financial affairs of the elderly in order to claw back costs of care			0
‘ avoidance inspectors ’ trawl through records to try and identify what they call ‘ deliberate deprivation ’ of assets			0
age @entity235 has called for the cap to be raised to £ 100,000 so that pensioners can protect their homes and pass on more savings to their children			0
the charity ’s director general @entity241 has previously said : ‘ the £ 23,250 cap is so sharp and is unfair on many people who have worked hard all their lives , because all their assets – including their home – are taken into account			1
they can see their savings swept away			0

@entity253 mp @entity6 's house was raided by police last year
