with eight in 10 mums planning to vote on may 7 , @entity17 and @entity18 are neck - and - neck , with 15 per cent saying they have been impressed with both the @entity21 prime minister and the @entity23 leader			1
it reveals that 55 per cent of them are not impressed with any of the current party leaders			1
@entity45 leader @entity44 was ranked third on 10 per cent , behind mr @entity17 and mr @entity18			0

@entity3 was especially popular among mums in @entity56 , where 19 per cent wanted to hear his views on politics , and among the under - 30s , where the figure was 21 per cent			1
more than a fifth ( 22 per cent ) of mums under the age of 30 would like to hear from @entity8 , who is currently on maternity leave from the popular daytime show			2

after the recent row over @entity89 ' second jobs , 57 per cent said they would be more likely to support someone who had ' normal lives ' outside politics			2
coming across as honest and not too stage - managed or polished would also woo 57 per cent			0
almost half want less jargon and less bickering and in - fighting			0
only 14 per cent said a politician having children would help win them over			0
the survey suggests that 80 per cent of so - called @entity100 are planning to vote , equivalent to 8.4million women			1

more than half ( 56 per cent ) focus on what politicians are saying , a third notice the language they are using and 30 per cent notice how trustworthy they sound			0
mr @entity17 last year used a @entity112 reshuffle to promote women including @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0

but such moves are seen as stunts			0
a third thought the reshuffle was a pr exercise			0
only 4 per cent thought it would make any difference to the political system			0
@entity128 , from @entity35 , said : ' with 80 of mums planning to turn up and cast their vote on polling day , @entity100 are an incredibly powerful force and most of them have n't made up their minds on which they 'll vote so it 's still all to play for			1
' through @entity138 , we 're giving mums across the country the chance to join the campaign trail and tell politicians directly what they want to see from next party in power			0
' they 've told us the policies they want and they 've told us what they 're looking for in the country 's next leader			0
one thing is clear : it 's a vote for mum if politicians take note			0
' mums want politicians to be honest , passionate and straight - talking , to have real - world experience , ideally gained in jobs outside of politics , and to do what 's right for them and the country â€“ it 's definitely substance over style that matters most to mums			1
