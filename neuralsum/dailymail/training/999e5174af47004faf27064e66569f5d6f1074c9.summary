by @entity0 you can play championship manager			2
you can be a @entity3			2
but there is no such game as fantasy executive chairman			2
and do you know why ? because you ’ve sort of got power , but you have n’t			2
the manager : he decides what happens on the football field			2
he picks the team , he devises the playing strategy , the fans recognise this and , during the good times , sing his name			2
star of the show ? or was @entity20 just the @entity23 family 's banker at @entity24 ? the owner : he provides the money			1
ultimately , he signs the cheques			0
he tells the manager who he can buy and for how much			2
the executive chairman , or chief executive ? well , ostensibly , he ’s in charge ; except he never picks the team and his business plan relies entirely on the patronage of a higher authority			0
@entity37 , chief executive of the @entity38 , is supposedly the most powerful man in football			0
yet his power only goes so far			0
@entity37 consistently opposes the loan system but loses whenever he puts the issue to the vote before his @entity38 chairmen			0
he is the boss right up to the point where the people calling the shots say ‘ no thank you ’			0
@entity20 found that out this week when a very rich woman decided she could spend her fortune , or not , without his assistance			1
he really should have known			0
one of his final statements as @entity24 ’s executive chairman spoke of his manager @entity55 in the coldest terms			1
‘ the manager is basically a department head like the others , ’ he told a @entity57 in @entity58			2
with a stunning lack of self - awareness , he forgot that this was all he was , too			0
he might have been the head of the department heads but he was an employee just the same			0
it was n’t his money , he merely acted as if it was			2
technically , he is correct about managers , although he failed to acknowledge that if the head of the football department fails he takes just about every other department down with him			0
it is hard to run an efficient commercial or financial operation from bottom of the league because revenues will be affected			0
@entity24 have long had a well - structured and successful academy ; they did not have much opportunity to showcase this , however , because they kept getting relegated			1
then a wonderful person turned up , a true saviour			2
not cortese but @entity23 , a @entity83 billionaire who had made his money in crane and construction equipment and was now in the mood for a little fun			1
he barely got to have it			0
@entity23 bought @entity24 on july 8 , 2009 , removing it from administration , and died of a heart attack on august 10 , 2010			1
in this brief period he had installed an ambitious young banker as executive chairman			0
@entity20 had impressed , most recently , at @entity94 in @entity95 and had a background on the financial side of sport and entertainment			1
overhaul : @entity101 ( centre ) became @entity24 's owner after the death of her father , @entity105 highly - rated : but it remains to be seen if @entity55 will be at @entity24 after this season saviour ? @entity83 billionaire @entity23 bought @entity24 and removed them from administration after @entity23 ’s death , his shattered family pledged to continue supporting @entity24 to honour their father ’s vision and , as this was to make the club a presence in the @entity116 , that meant honouring @entity20 ’s vision , too			1
he proved an excellent administrator and @entity24 returned to the @entity38 through two divisions			1
@entity121 did his bit , and more significantly @entity123 , who won both promotions			0
helping hands : @entity121 ( left ) and @entity123 ( right ) played a role in @entity24 's progress yet @entity20 ’s managers never seemed to get much of a mention when he did his interviews			1
he was part of a new breed : the manager - chairman			2
he spoke as if @entity24 was a one - man show — and he was the star			1
occasionally stories would appear linking him with a move to @entity137 or another top club as if he was a player			0
the first inkling of trouble ahead this week came when those rumours resurfaced on monday			0
and what seemed to be forgotten in all this was that the bill for @entity20 ’s grand plan — impressive though it was — always landed at the door of @entity23 ’s daughter , @entity147			1
without her , @entity20 might as well have been playing a computer game			1
one anecdote retold in newspapers on friday detailed @entity147 ’s only previous meeting with manager @entity55 before thursday ’s five - minute conversation in the wake of @entity20 ’s departure			1
it took place at a dinner for staff and players at the @entity161 , arranged by @entity20			1
talented squad : but without the necessary investment , @entity24 would n't have been able to spend @entity101 was present too , it was reported			1
indeed , because she was paying for it			0
big - hearted @entity166 was in the chair as usual , but it was @entity170 money he was spending : £ 14million to buy the club , £ 38m in loans converted to equity and £ 75m on players over five years			2
@entity20 did a fine job but that is all it was , a job			1
he invested a rich man ’s money , as bankers do , for a fee			2
in the season @entity24 returned to the @entity38 , @entity20 received £ 1.6m			1
and @entity101 may prove to be a dud , by comparison			0
she may have no interest in football and might no longer feel the emotional pull that existed when her father died ; it is now suggested she wants to sell			0
this would be a great pity			0
but , as @entity20 of all people would understand , it ’s also business			1
sometimes rich people like to cash in			0
as long as she does n’t want to change the colours to blue , move @entity24 to the @entity201 or sell to a crook , that ’s her prerogative			1
impressive ? @entity20 did a good job at @entity24 but needed financial backing to do so so what happens from here ? the prediction was for a tearful exodus of distraught staff and players but @entity55 needed five minutes with his new boss on thursday to decide he was staying			1
he will consider his position at the end of the season , he says , but would have done that anyway			0
with significant investment needed to secure @entity116 football , @entity24 will soon hit the glass ceiling			1
if @entity55 gets a better offer , a club with greater potential , he may angle to leave			1
he may even use @entity20 ’s departure as his cover story , but it will be a ruse			1
few coaches , and no players , quit over the demise of an executive chairman , no matter how visionary			0
successful youth policy : @entity229 and @entity230 showed @entity24 only needed money to progress @entity20 has been good for @entity24 , but his was hardly a lone mission			1
by the time he arrived in 2009 @entity230 was at @entity234 , @entity229 was at @entity235 , @entity236 was established enough to be sold within the year and @entity237 had been a professional there since 2006			0
this was a club with a successful , established youth policy , a strong fan base and a new ground , languishing in @entity243 due to poor financial management			0
@entity245 restored the natural order , @entity23 money , and @entity20 spent it well , as the best bankers do			1
that ’s why billionaires use them .			0

former owner @entity23 was @entity24 's real saviour
@entity20 would n't have been able to do much without @entity23 's money
if manager @entity55 leaves it wo n't be because @entity20 has
@entity24 will soon hit the glass ceiling if more money is n't spent
