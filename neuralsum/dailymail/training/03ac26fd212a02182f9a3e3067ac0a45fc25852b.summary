by @entity0 last updated at 10:26 pm on 29th november 2011 as a new sex allegation threatens to unravel @entity4 's @entity3 bid , an ex-business partner of his accuser today shedding new light on the woman 's past			2
@entity11 businesswoman @entity10 came forward last night during a tv interview to reveal that she has carried on a 13 - is an unemployed single mother - of - two with numerous evictions on her record - including one just this month			1
she also had a protection order sought against her by an ex-business partner , @entity16			0
but somewhere along the way , their business relationship soured , with miss @entity16 seeking a ' stalking protective order ' after ms @entity10 sent out a defamatory email about her in december , according to miss @entity16 's lawyer , @entity38			1
miss @entity16 accused ms white of sending her repeated emails and texts threatening a lawsuit , as well as defamation of character			0
while that case was later dropped , miss @entity16 then filed a libel lawsuit on june 9 and won after ms @entity10 never responded to the case			1
the case will now go to a jury to decide a dollar amount for damages			0
meanwhile , @entity4 told staffers today that he 's reassessing his campaign a day after @entity11 businesswoman @entity10 alleged a 13 - year extramarital affair with the @entity54			1
he has fiercely denied the affair as well as several other accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour that have surfaced over the past month and he has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race			2
coming forward : ms @entity10 , an @entity11 businesswoman , she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first ' here we go again ' : @entity4 went on tv to deny the allegations that he had an affair ... before they fully emerged he told senior staff in a mid-morning conference call lasting roughly 10 minutes that all public events will go forward this week but he will review the campaign 's strategy over the next several days			1
one participant on the call , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the conversation , said that as part of that assessment , @entity4 's campaign is examining the impact of the newest allegations			2
this person described the tone as positive but also said there was some uncertainty coming from @entity4			0
' he said obviously it 's taken an emotional toll on his family , but he 's moving ahead with the campaign , ' said @entity90 , @entity4 's @entity91 campaign chairman			0
' he said that they will be reassessing the campaign			0
' @entity90 added : ' he said this lady was a friend , someone he thought was a friend , that he was trying to help out financially and had been a friend for some period of time			0
but that nothing inappropriate occurred			0
' when asked about the libel case and its impact on her accusations against @entity4 , ms @entity10 said : ' well , because i admit it			1
whatever happened with @entity105 and i - um - happened			0
' just as , what , what , there would make no sense to come out with these allegations against @entity4 if it absolutely was n't true			2
' ms @entity10 ’s attorney told @entity112 that she did n’t respond because to the case because she thought it had already been settled			1
also , in 2001 , she filed a sexual harassment claim against her former employer , which was later settled			0
standing by her man : @entity4 's wife @entity117 , who married him in 1968 , has been consistent in her support for her husband going on : mr @entity4 said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her mr @entity4 denied the affair , but a statement from his attorney side - steps the question entirely by claiming the allegations are not a matter open for public scrutiny			1
but they represent the most serious claims yet against mr @entity4 , who has been accused of sexual harassment against four other women			1
and mr @entity4 began defending himself before the allegations even surfaced			1
he broke the news himself on @entity136 that ms @entity10 would make claims against him			1
' this appears to be an accusation of private , alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public , ' said a statement from mr @entity4 's lawyer			1
the statement , however , does not explicitly deny the affair			0
in an interview with @entity112 in @entity11 yesterday , ms @entity10 said she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story before she herself could			1
' i 'm not proud , ' she said			0
' i did not want to do this			0
' mr @entity4 has been accused of sexual harassment by four other women , two of whom have come forward publicly with their allegations			1
as well as an alleged relationship with @entity10 , mr @entity4 has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women : however , to this point , the only accusations were about inappropriate advances or comments			1
ms @entity10 is saying he cheated on his wife for more than a decade ' it was pretty simple			2
it was n't complicated , ' she told the local tv station			0
' i was aware that he was married			0
and i was also aware i was involved in a very inappropriate situation , relationship			0
' mr @entity4 has been married to his wife @entity117 since 1968			2
both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment			2
and mr @entity4 's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete			1
' i just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up , " here we go again , " ' he told @entity186 on @entity136 's @entity187			0
the @entity189 native said he knew the woman as an ' acquaintance who i thought was a friend			0
' he denied having an affair , instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems			0
@entity4 also deflected criticism and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him out of office			2
as proof of the lengthy relationship , ms @entity10 offered her mobile phone , which has mr @entity4 's private number			1
ms @entity10 also showed mobile phone records dating back four months that have 61 phone calls and text messages to or from mr @entity4 as early as 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm			1
' he made it very intriguing , ' ms @entity10 told @entity210 5			2
it was something that took me away from my humdrum life at the time			0
' ms @entity10 said the two met in @entity219 , @entity220 , in the late 1990s when mr @entity4 was the president of the @entity221			1
that night , she says , mr @entity4 took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room			2
' i 'd like to see you again			0
you are beautiful to me , and i would love for us to continue this friendship , ' ms @entity10 claims mr @entity4 told her			1
from then , he paid for her to fly to his speaking engagements across the country , where he put her up in fancy hotels and restaurants like the @entity233 and the @entity234			2
