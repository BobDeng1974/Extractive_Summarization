by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 16:13 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 09:11 est , 7 march 2014 business tycoon @entity3 said thursday that the @entity1 is ' becoming a third - world country , ' declared the nation 's true unemployment rate is ' probably 21 or 22 percent , ' and warned that @entity8 's approval ratings were approaching the malaise of ' the late , great @entity10			1
' @entity10 , the 39th @entity1 president , is very much alive			1
the gaffe took the luster off of an otherwise energetic presentation at the @entity14 near @entity15 , one that was lacking any hint that @entity3 might run for president in 2016			1
railing against federal tax and other economic mandates that will trigger in the years after president @entity8 leaves office , @entity3 said he predictions of ' economic catastrophe ' in 2017 and 2018 are flying through the business community			1
' whoever 's president [ then ] , good luck ! ' he exclaimed			2
you 're going to have to be very smart			0
you 're going to have to be very sharp			0
' we owe $ 17 trillion – our debt			0
how do you pay off $ 17 trillion ? ... we have deficits that no one can even comprehend			0
' @entity8 , he insisted , is ' so weak and so pathetic ' that @entity42 's leaders know they can devalue their currency without any consequences			1
' they believe that they can get away with it , ' @entity3 said			1
' and believe me , they 're taking our jobs , and they 're taking them big - league ...			0
they have no respect for our leader			0
' unemployment , @entity3 told thousands gathered at the @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , is ' probably 21 or 22 percent ' in ' real numbers			1
' ' when you give up looking for a job , it 's like they consider you employed , ' he complained			0
the @entity1 @entity67 said in january that the nation 's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent			2
but the so - called ' @entity71 ' unemployment measure , which counts short - term workers and those who have taken themselves out of the labor force , ' is early twice as high – 13.1 per cent			2
@entity75 could n't find any economic research suggesting a 21 or 22 per cent unemployment rate in the @entity1 @entity3 could get into the presidential race in 2016 , but seemed to suggest he 'll sit it out rough life : @entity3 flew to @entity15 on thursday after opening the new @entity81 at his @entity82 in @entity83 @entity3 said he sees ' so little leadership from the @entity85 , ' topped off with a crumbling infrastructure – airports , roads and bridges – that slows down business entrepreneurs ' we 're becoming a third - world country , ' he complained			1
after noting briefly that the @entity94 law ' has to be changed – has to be ! ' @entity3 warned conservatives that siding with advocates of immigration reform will bring @entity98 legitimacy to a slew of new @entity102 voters			1
' every one of those votes goes to the @entity102 ...			0
you will not get any of those votes no matter what you do , no matter how nice you are , no matter how soft you are , ' he said			2
coming down on the side of closed - border hawks , an exasperated @entity3 threw up his hands			1
' we 're either a country or we 're not			0
we either have borders or we do n't , ' he told an appreciative crowd			0
' i mean , you have a border , you have a country , and if you do n't have a border , what are we ? uh , uh , uh – nothing			0
' @entity3 will appear at an april 12 summit in @entity122 alongside @entity124 sen. @entity123 , @entity126 sen. @entity125 , former @entity128 gov. @entity127 ; former house speaker @entity129 and @entity131 rep. @entity130 .			2

@entity3 referred to @entity8 's *tanking* approval ratings as nearing the lows of ' the late , great @entity10 '
he hinted that he might sit out the 2016 presidential race
@entity3 's unemployment figures are far higher than those of *government* or *academic* economists
*relaxing* the @entity144 *platform* on immigration , he warned , would bring in millions of new voters and ' you will not get any of those votes no matter what you do '
' @entity3 ' spoke at the @entity151 near @entity15 , *entertaining* thousands of right - wing *partisans*
