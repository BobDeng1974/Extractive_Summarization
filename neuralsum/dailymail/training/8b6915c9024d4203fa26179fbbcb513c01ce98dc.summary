scientists have found the brain 's ' misery molecule ' believed to be responsible for all of our feelings of stress and anxiety scientists have found the brain 's ' misery molecule ' believed to be responsible for all of our feelings of stress and anxiety			2
researchers believe that the protein - named @entity11 - could also be linked to depression			1
a team from @entity15 , a medical company based in @entity16 , used one of the world 's most powerful x-ray machines to study the brain 's pituitary gland			2
it has long been known that the gland controls stress , depression and anxiety by releasing stress chemicals , the @entity22 reports			0
now , scientists have discovered the response is triggered by @entity11 - which is found in the outer membranes of pituitary cells			1
@entity31 , chief scientific officer at @entity32 , told the paper : ' stress related diseases such as depression and anxiety affect a quarter of adults each year , but what many people do n't realise is that these conditions are controlled by proteins in the brain , one of which is @entity11			0
' she added that now they have worked out the structure of it and how it works it could open up potential to design drugs to control it			0
@entity11 sits in pituitary cells and detects the stress molecules detected by the hypothalamus , a portion of the brain which produces hormones that control , body temperature , hunger and moods - among others			1
a team from @entity15 , a medical company based in @entity16 , used the @entity63 ( pictured ) one of the world 's most powerful x-ray machines to study the brain 's pituitary gland when it picks one of these molecules up , it triggers the parent cell to release the hormones which lead to stress and anxiety , the paper reports			1
using the @entity63 , based in @entity76 , @entity77 , which produces powerful x-ray beams , researchers were able to study the protein 's structure and pin point areas which could be targeted by new drugs			0
ms @entity31 said they had identified a ' crevice ' which would be an ideal area to aim a molecule which could be specially designed to block @entity11 - effectively disabling it			2
she said the team now hope to use this research method to analyse molecules involved in type 2 diabetes - with the hope of one day developing a drug which can be taken orally as opposed to the injections which sufferers of the condition have to use .			0

researchers found the protein - named @entity11 - in the pituitary gland
it triggers cells to release hormones linked with stress and anxiety
they now hope to create a drug which can target and block this function
