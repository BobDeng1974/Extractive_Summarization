sky diving is not for the faint of heart and neither is this footage of a student skydiver who almost falls to his death during a sky diving lesson gone very , very wrong			1
@entity8 reports that a student skydiver named @entity10 ended up in a dangerous position mid-air and his instructors frantically managed to re-position him to safety			1
' during an accelerated free fall level 3 lesson , this student skydiver named @entity10 experienced an incredibly tense moment after ending up on his backside			2
luckily one of his quick thinking instructions managed to stabilize his spinning motion after getting into a safe position , ' says @entity8 's description of the video			0
the instructors are seen holding the student in the air by either side to make sure that he does n't spiral out of control			0
unfortunately for the student , gravity is a force to be reckoned with and despite being thrown into the correct position , what goes up sometimes goes upside down			0
the instructors weave from side to side do their best to get below the student who is spinning repeatedly			0
one instructor finally manages to grab onto the student , stop him from spinning , and help him release his parachute			2
all three sky divers land safely from a flight they 'll never , ever forget			1
reverse is the curse : @entity25 spins and begins falling on his back , a position from which he can not release his parachute to ensure a safe landing heroic endeavor : from far away , the instructor can be seen bringing @entity25 to safe position for falling so that he may release his parachute and land safely safe landing : both instructors and @entity25 manage to release their parachutes and fall safely in the correct face - down position towards the ground			1

@entity81 student skydiver @entity10 spirals onto his back while skydiving , a deadly position from which it 's *impossible* to *launch* a parachute
