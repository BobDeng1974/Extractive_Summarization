' her comments in @entity24 yesterday came after mr @entity8 wrote to unions saying he was willing to meet but the ' direction of travel ' on key issues was ' fixed '			2

this week , mr @entity8 wrote to the @entity2 and the @entity34 ( @entity28 ) to say he was willing to meet the unions to discuss the issues , but insisting that the ‘ direction of travel ’ on both pensions and pay is ‘ fixed ’			1
ms @entity1 said : ‘ negotiation is about sitting across the table having an exchange and listening to people			0
‘ what he ’s saying is pay and pensions are done and dusted , and there ’s no reason to talk about it			0
that ’s not our view			0

’ delegates at the @entity2 ’s annual conference are expected to debate a priority motion today confirming the union ’s plan for industrial action with the @entity28			2
money woes : the two main reasons for the teacher walkout are the government 's controversial public sector pension reforms and plans to introduce performance - related pay ( file photo ) ms @entity1 said ‘ while it is entirely possible for members to seek to amend the priority motion , the purpose of the motion is to go forward from conference with a ringing endorsement of the strategy with the @entity28			1
’ she also rounded on mr @entity8 for previously calling his critics ‘ enemies of promise ’			0
‘ i think people were astonished when @entity8 used the expression ‘ enemies of promise ’			0
