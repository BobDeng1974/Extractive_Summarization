a goal to restore some @entity2 belief , a goal to stop @entity4 turning the @entity5 into their own private show			1
they will be thankful for this much further afield than @entity9			2
it was , it must be said , something of a throwback moment			0
only seconds remaining and the ball hits the back of the net at the @entity16 so hard that it could have burst			0
in the car parks , those who had abandoned their seats — abandoned hope — minutes earlier must have felt the ground tremble a little beneath their feet			0
this time , the cause was a little different of course			2
over the years , @entity2 have scored late goals to win titles and cup ties			1
there was a period when it was n’t a case of wondering whether @entity2 would equalise but whether they would go on and win , too			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity34 takes his shirt off as he celebrates his late equaliser against @entity4 on sunday @entity37 makes no mistake as he fires home to score a late equaliser for @entity2 at @entity9 here , it was n’t about that			1
this was a goal — struck purely from the laces of @entity34 — that gave @entity2 a little of their self - respect back			1
the point it earned them probably wo n’t matter particularly at the end of the season but if it brings with it some momentum then it could prove priceless			1
this was a fixture that @entity2 supporters had been eyeing with some trepidation for a while			1
the first ‘ big ’ game of the season			0
there was a question , nervously asked , that if @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 could beat @entity67 ’s team then just what could the leaders of the @entity5 do here ? so , yes , this was not so much about the here and now but the future			1
there may have been some fortune about the free - kick awarded to them when @entity75 tangled with @entity76 down the left side , which resulted in a red card for a second booking			1
but the way @entity82 arrived to power a header towards goal said as much for his own restored confidence as it did @entity2 ’s conviction that they could take something			1
@entity37 ’s finish , meanwhile , was reminiscent of better days			0
@entity4 defender @entity75 is sent off for a second booking towards the end of the match @entity2 's @entity76 lies on the ground in pain after a late challenge by @entity75 at @entity9 @entity2 ’s centre forward had been poor prior to that moment , as he has been for much of the season			1
twice he had failed to beat @entity4 goalkeeper @entity98 in one - on - one situations while he had also been partly culpable when @entity100 headed @entity4 in to the lead early in the second half , drifting off the near post a fraction before the ball arrived			1
@entity37 remains some way from his best			0
with @entity108 back from suspension for next week ’s @entity111 derby and @entity112 expected to be fit , he may not even start			0
his assessment of his team after the final whistle was nevertheless interesting			0
‘ in my opinion we are better every day , ’ he said			0
‘ in training and if you look at games you can see we are comfy on the ball and we are playing better			0
’ @entity2 midfielder @entity82 ( right ) chases down the ball with opponent @entity75 @entity37 ( left ) attempts to score past @entity4 goalkeeper @entity98 but misses had @entity2 been playing a full - strength @entity4 they may have suffered			1
the league leaders missed injured striker @entity124 desperately			0
@entity100 fought manfully at the point of @entity4 ’s attack but the absence of @entity124 ’s pace served to undo much of the terrific approach play of @entity130 and the @entity132 oscar			1
@entity2 were missing players too , though , and the way @entity135 dragged improved performances from @entity82 and young @entity137 said something about him and indeed the way his team are finally beginning to understand the principles he likes to talk so much about			2
@entity82 was terrific on sunday			0
he looked focused , athletic and energetic			0
he used to be like that at @entity146 before he succumbed to the ‘ big club syndrome ’ that similarly afflicted his manager @entity148 last season			0
@entity100 rises above @entity150 to fire his header towards goal and score the opener for @entity4 @entity2 's @entity137 ( right ) looks to take the ball past @entity4 's @entity155 here he worked manfully to stifle @entity155 and it worked			1
@entity4 ’s playmaker will rarely have a quieter game			2
the @entity159 was similarly influential at the other end of the field , though , and may well have played his way in to next sunday ’s derby team			0
@entity4 will have gone home disappointed			2
denied victory by @entity168 ’s late goal at @entity169 last month and by @entity37 ’s strike here , @entity165 knows that his team ’s lead over the champions @entity169 could already be 11 points			2
as it is , it is a much more modest six			0
@entity165 ’s team have the look of the best in the country at the moment			0
there is an energy and dexterity about the @entity4 midfield that can appear irresistible at times			2
on sunday , though , they were matched — if not bettered — for long periods by @entity2			1
for @entity135 and his team , that represents progress			0
like our @entity2 facebook page			2
@entity4 manager @entity165 ( left ) and @entity2 boss @entity67 embrace after the final whistle			1

@entity34 equalised deep into injury time to rescue a point for @entity2 in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity4
the goal could bring some momentum with it for @entity67 's side
@entity4 were matched - if not bettered - for long periods by @entity2
