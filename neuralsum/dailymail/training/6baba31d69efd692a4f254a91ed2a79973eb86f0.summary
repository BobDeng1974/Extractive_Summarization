for a studious , well - behaved private schoolgirl looking forward to a milestone coming - of - age , it was the perfect early 18th birthday present			0
and @entity3 , 17 , was undoubtedly looking forward to the trip to @entity5 with her mum @entity6 - presumably to hit the shops , see the sights and maybe even take in a show			2
what probably was n’t in her plans was an unexpected online flirting session with a @entity14 superstar almost twice her age			0
in the @entity35 this week , the excited @entity34 teenager spotted @entity18 outside the stage door of the @entity25 production in which he is starring at the moment			1
miss @entity3 , who attends prestigious independent school @entity39 in @entity40 , reached for her mobile and took some pictures of the @entity43 and @entity45 star , and then - as teenagers are wont to do – she turned the lens on herself and took some ‘ selfies ’ with the 35 - year - old box office hit in the background			1
it is understood that @entity18 spotted miss @entity3 taking the photos and shouted to her that she should put the photographs on the online picture - sharing site @entity20 and ‘ tag ’ him so he would be alerted to them			1
according to @entity14 gossip websites , the pair later started an internet conversation that led to the now - famous rejection			0
in what appear to be screenshots from @entity20 , @entity18 works fast to establish where @entity63 is from and how long she will be in @entity5			0
he then seems to fire off three questions in quick succession : ‘ you ’re 18 ? ’ ‘ who are you with ? ’ and ‘ do you have a bf ( boyfriend ) ? ’ making a move : the alleged messages show @entity18 asking @entity3 if he should ' rent a room ' in her hotel and attempts to convince her it is really him ' do n't tell ' : the teen asks the star to send her a photo of himself holding a piece of paper with her name on , which he apparently does miss @entity3 replies : ‘ nearly 18 , my mum and not if you ’re around			1
’ @entity18 then asks exactly when her birthday is and where she is staying in @entity5			2
the conversation then appeared to switch to text message , and @entity18 asks ‘ can i see you ? you ’re single ? what ’s the hotel ? should i rent a room ? ’ when miss @entity3 , from @entity39 , voices concerns the conversation could be an @entity94 by an imposter , @entity18 posts a picture of himself to prove it is genuine			1
the sensible teen then decides : ‘ i ’ll come back when i ’m 18			0
’ @entity18 responds : ‘ if you do n’t want to meet text me when you do			0
’ the screenshots of the conversation have taken @entity102 and @entity104 gossip sites by storm – although it is unclear whether they are genuine or not , and fans claimed they could just be a publicity stunt			0
it is worth noting that @entity18 ’s next film is the story of a high school teacher who is dating one of his pupils – and several eagle - eyed online commentators last night floated the suggestion that the exchange with miss @entity3 could be a sophisticated joke			2
one man who has come out of the story very well is miss @entity63 ’s boyfriend @entity120 – an 18 - year - old fellow @entity39 pupil who seemed pleased to have beaten @entity18 in the love stakes			1
during a conversation with a friend posted on @entity20 , miss @entity3 said : ' @entity18 asked me to meet him alone @entity127 ! it was really him and i rejected him ! ! [ what ] am i doing ? ! ' ' why are you thirsty for underage ones ? ' : @entity18 tweeted this after the news broke but later deleted it meeting : @entity3 shared this photo on @entity20 with @entity18 in the background outside the @entity25 he had performed in , sparking the flirting she then added : ' i am going to regret this for years - it 's given me a confidence boost though lol			1
' the friend named @entity127 then said : ' " damn strait [ sic ] it should also give @ dbrodieb a f * * * * * * huge confidence boost that you 'd say no to @entity18 for him hahaha that is true love			0
@ dbrodieb who appears to be @entity3 's boyfriend , said : ' i 'm on top of the world @entity127 ! ' another woman of the @entity3 family – miss @entity3 ’s grandmother @entity153 – seemed equally unimpressed with @entity18			1
what controversy ? : @entity18 ignored the claims on thursday and instead boasted that he now has 1.6million @entity20 followers publicity stunt ? : @entity3 shared this photo in @entity159 on @entity20			1
@entity18 ' alleged actions could be to promote his new movie @entity162 , in which he plays a soccer coach who seduces his 14 - year - old babysitter ' not if you 're around ' : @entity3 , who also posted this photo of herself and her mother , apparently told @entity18 she was ' nearly 18 ' and that it did n't matter whether or not she had a boyfriend she said : ' at our age we do n't know who this actor is - i 've never heard of him			1
' trust our @entity3 though , she is a very pretty girl and she 's just finding her feet now as a young woman			2
' i 'm not surprised she gets noticed			0
but better that she does n't marry a hollywood star just yet ! ' @entity18 has not released a statement regarding the incident but did tweet in reference to a comment that he liked younger women saying : ' i ’m not ! i hope parents keep their teens away from me			2
’ - with a link to an @entity20 photo that has since been removed			0
the age of consent in @entity5 is 17 , so even if the exchange is genuine , @entity18 is not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law – but his actions drew criticism from fans last night			2
on gossip site @entity198 , a user called moooose wrote : ' it ’s interesting how someone could go from a charming sexy intellectual to a disgusting creepy perv over night			0

messages allegedly from @entity18 ask her age and if she has a boyfriend
when she write that she 's staying in hotel he asks ' should i rent a room ? '
