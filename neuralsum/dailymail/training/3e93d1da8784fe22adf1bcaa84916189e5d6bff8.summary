a court in @entity1 has ruled that it is acceptable to masturbate in public as long as it is not directed at anyone			2
the ruling came in a landmark judgement following a case brought against a man seen touching himself on a beach			1
the 65 - year - old man , who dropped his shorts close to the water at @entity15 beach , @entity16 , and started to masturbate , was initially charged with sexual assault			1
but in a surprise ruling , the @entity18 acquitted the man			1
while the judgement stated it ' may be proven that the man exposed himself and masturbated on this occasion ' , it subsequently added that no offence had been committed			2
@entity18 , pictured , has acquitted a man accused of sexual assault for masturbating on a beach , because it was not directed at anyone it based its finding on the fact that the man was not pleasuring himself towards a specific person , according to @entity1 's @entity35 news website , @entity36			1
prosecutors held their hands up in agreement , underlining that the law calls for the act to be directed at another person to count as a crime			2
public prosecutor @entity44 told the @entity46 newspaper that he was n't planning to appeal the ruling			0
he told the paper , quoted in @entity36 : ' for this to be a criminal offence it 's required that the sexual molestation was directed towards one or more people			2
i think the court 's judgement is reasonable			0
' the 65 - year - old man was initially accused of sexual assault after he pleasured himself on an inland beach at @entity58 , near @entity16 , @entity1 the decision raises questions about whether public masturbation will now be acceptable across @entity1 , so long as it is not directed at another person			1
mr @entity44 appeared to think so , ' the district court has made a judgement on this case			0
with that we can conclude that it is okay to masturbate on the beach			2
the act may be considered to be disorderly conduct ' he said			0
@entity1 , like its @entity73 neighbours , tends to have a more tolerant and sometimes progressive approach to social issues			0
in the @entity78 , indecent exposure comes under the @entity79			1
it involves the public display of parts of the anatomy in a manner that may be offensive to others and morally unacceptable			0
instances brought to court include people exposing themselves in a manner considered indecent and particularly offensive to others on trains , buses and other public areas			2
masturbation or touching oneself in view of the public in a blatantly sexual manner is covered by the law			0
the test of decency or otherwise depends on the audience , the community rules and whether or not the exposure is intended to and / or does repel the public			0
sunbathing for example , in few or even no clothes , is unlikely to cause offence and therefore constitute indecent exposure			1
if convicted , the most likely penalty is a fine and / or community service rather than a custodial sentence , although indecent exposure can result in a maximum jail term of 24 months , depending on the circumstances			1
but this landmark ruling raises concerns over the extent to which people will take advantage of the freedom to masturbate with impunity in public			0
dr @entity126 , a reader in @entity127 at @entity128 who has carried out research into @entity1 's child protection system , said she thought this ruling was surprising			0
' @entity1 has a really robust child protection system and very rigorous investigation around sexual abuse			0
' so this judgement is surprising given that such an act could be witnessed by children as well as adults ' she said			0
the case comes hot on the heels of a recent similar judgement , in which a 15 - year - old boy was acquitted of sexual assault after he threw his underwear into a lake and stood naked in front of two underage girls			1
both girls had requested the boy be charged with molestation , but the @entity18 ruled that his behaviour was not of a sexual nature so the charge was dismissed , according to @entity36			1
in the @entity78 anyone who masturbates in public or exposes themself in any way faces an indecent exposure charge .			1

man , 65 , acquitted of sexual assault after masturbating on beach
@entity18 ruled he committed no crime since he was not directing his action towards a specific person
anyone doing the same in the @entity78 would face charge of indecent exposure
