an @entity1 councillor donated a kidney to someone he barely knew on monday and credited his strong faith for inspiring him			0
@entity6 councillor @entity5 , 34 , and @entity7 , 46 , had met only a couple of times before but the pair just got a whole lot closer after @entity12 gave @entity7 his kidney in a life - saving rare organ donation surgery			1
' words ca n’t describe what he ’s done for me , ' said @entity7 , to @entity18			1
blessed : @entity7 , 46 , was given a life - saving kidney donation from @entity6 councillor @entity5 , 34 , whom he 'd only met a few times before blood brothers : ' he ’s given me life , ' said @entity23 as he held back tears from his hospital bed ' he ’s given me life , ' said @entity7 as he held back tears			1
@entity7 told @entity18 that he was never the type to get a check - up and remained in relatively good health for most of his life			0
all of that changed in february of this year when a friend of @entity7 died at age 50 without warning and @entity7 decided it would be a good idea to see a doctor to evaluate his own well - being a few months later			0
following the check - up , the doctor gave @entity7 some unfortunate news			1
@entity7 was in renal failure and was told to report home and go to @entity42 where he was fitted for a catheter for dialysis			0
@entity7 lost 18 pounds in just one week and the function level of his kidneys dropped from eight per cent to four per cent			0
@entity7 needed a new functioning kidney and the gift @entity12 gave him on monday is nothing short of a miracle			1
doctors told @entity7 to survive that he would need to get a new kidney from a living donor			0
most kidney donations come from cadavers but the average wait for receiving one can take up to four years			0
@entity7 ’s wife @entity57 offered her kidney but she was turned down because she has diabetes			1
miracle : had @entity7 not had undergone a routine check - up he may not even know that his kidney was failing out of desperation , @entity57 took to social media to talk about her husband ’s need for a living donor			2
@entity12 saw the post and felt an explainable urge to help a man he ’d met only a handful of times before			1
‘ i ’m a spiritual guy , ’ @entity12 said in an interview last week			1
‘ i ’ve gone to church all my life			0
but i ca n’t say i ’ve ever had something happen to me where i just felt that i was not making the decision			1
i read this , and i just felt moved to do something			2
’ @entity12 was tested by the hospital and the kidney was a fit and so he made the decision that would save @entity7 ’s life			1
@entity12 ’s wife @entity86 also urged him to give @entity23 the gift he would keep with him for the rest of his life			2
‘ it ’s a sacrifice , ’ said @entity12			2
‘ after feeling what i have felt the last couple of days , i think i agree with that a little more			0
but really it ’s such a privilege because you ’re in a position where i ’m going to be up and around in two weeks and my life ’s going to be back to normal			0
new beginnings : @entity12 may have lost his liver by giving it to @entity7 but what he gained was a lifetime friendship ‘ you see what it means to these guys here , and it means the world to me			2
’ the @entity110 held a meeting on tuesday and the members were blown away by @entity12 ’s great deed			1
‘ i ’m absolutely blown away by what councillor @entity12 has done , ’ said mayor @entity114 ‘ i feel honored to know someone who would give this gift that is beyond measure			2
… @entity5 ’ gift is a shining example of selflessness , ’ she added			0
‘ when you hear about something like this , you tend to ask yourself , “ would i do that ? ” said @entity122 , @entity6 ’s city manager / ‘ for family , for a close friend ? maybe			0
but for a friend of a friend ? i do n’t know of many people who would do that			0
’ @entity7 feels blessed for people like @entity12 and if he has one word of advice for anyone reading it ’s they go to the doctor and get a check - up that just might save their life .			1

@entity6 councillor @entity5 , 34 , and @entity7 , 46 , only met a couple of times but @entity12 gave @entity7 his kidney and saved his life
