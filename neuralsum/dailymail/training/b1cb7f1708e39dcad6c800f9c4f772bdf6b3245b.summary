taken by photographer @entity6 , 59 , from western @entity7 , these inventive birds can be seen catching the drops before they hit the ground in @entity10			1
the honeyeater is a bird indigenous to @entity7 , well known for their diversity and their peculiar ' brush tipped tongue ' which they use to take nectar from flowers			1
a brown honeyeater catching a water droplet falling from a tap photographer @entity6 , 59 , took the pictures in @entity10 in western @entity7 the bids are similar to the @entity25 , but they lack the evolutionary biology that the hummingbird has , preventing them from having consistent hovering flight			1
most honeyeaters eat nectar , but many also feast on insects , with some eating more insects than nectar depending on their whereabouts in the country			0
many also feed on the pollen , berries and sap of plants as well as the sugary secretions of plant bugs			0
many honeyeaters are very territorial , with larger types often fighting it out with smaller species for the largest and most nectar - filled flowers many of the birds move around a lot , searching out different sources of nectar , such as flowering eucalyptus			2
other types are more sedentary , and some species are strongly territorial			0
while several different species of honeyeater often compete for the same resources in the same area , the larger species tend to win the battles for access to flowers , because they can fight off the smaller ones			2
however , some smaller species can coexist with the large species because they do n't need as much food and can sneak into flowering plants if there is enough foliage cover for them to hide from the larger birds			0
the honeyeater diet is distinctly diverse , and this has caused a rapid differentiation in the amount of species , some focusing on pollen and others focusing on insects the birds are somewhat similar to the hummingbird , but they lack the biological adaptations necessary for extended hovering flight because gardeners tend to grow plants with large floral displays , urban areas can give lots of food for honeyeaters , meaning that they tend to congregate in towns and cities			1
however , the small honeyeaters often find it hard to compete in these areas , because there is not enough foliage to provide cover for them to hide from the larger species .			0

pictures were taken in a *national* park in western @entity7
the honeyeater is a bird indigenous to @entity7 , one of their most diverse
birds are *prolific* in large city gardens because they feed on open flowers
