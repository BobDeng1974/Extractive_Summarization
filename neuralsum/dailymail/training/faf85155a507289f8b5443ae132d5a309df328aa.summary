sandwiched between a @entity1 and a charity shop and filled with overflowing rubbish bins , this dank and dingy alleyway is far from the perfect home			1
but the unusual south @entity6 plot captured the imagination of one buyer desperate for a place in the city and fetched £ 260,000 at auction			0
the narrow lane , which measures 900sq			0
ft , on @entity14 in @entity15 was snapped up for more than five times its guide price of £ 55,000 when it went up for sale earlier this week			1
cramped : the passageway is between a @entity1 and a charity shop on @entity14 in @entity15			1
the narrow lane , which is partially covered , fetched more than five times its original guide price at auction filthy : the alleyway , which sold for £ 260,000 at auction is currently used as a dumping ground for rubbish @entity28 : a view of the road from inside the alleyway reveals just how dark it is beneath the brick archway neat and narrow : this site plan from @entity36 shows the alleyway , circled , wedged between two other retail sites			1
planning permission allows for the construction of a first - floor extension the new owner will be hoping to transform the dark passageway into something more appealing			1
planning permission included in the price means that it can be converted to a comfortable residential space and there is even suggestion that it could be used as an artist 's studio			1
and while the neat site does not come with any outdoor space - the bustling south @entity6 road is just a short walk to both @entity57 and @entity58			2
in an online description , @entity59 said : ' local amenities are available along the length of @entity14 , including its popular street market			2
' planning permission granted by @entity36 allows for the construction of a first - floor extension beneath the covered portion of the alleyway that can extend out to the open - air rear			1
the building work means that the new owner could build a comfortable 900sq			0
ft home , a spacious artist 's studio - or a combination of the two			2
to keep the new property on the busy south @entity6 road safe , the planning permission also allows for the installation of entrance gates and a ground - floor lobby			1
@entity81 , director of @entity59 , told the @entity82 that he was only a ' little bit ' surprised by the amount the alleyway sold for as it had ' attracted a lot of interest '			0
he said : ' this is a classic example of a property finding its value in the auction room			0
the area around the property is red hot			0
' we have sold all sorts of stuff over the years but this is maybe one of the most unique lots			0
' at £ 260,000 , the partially - covered alleyway comes in at just £ 15,000 less than the average current value of a home in the @entity102 - which comes in at £ 275,000 , according to the @entity103			1
for the same price , property - hunters could buy a five - bedroom detached home in picturesque @entity108 or a spacious four - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity111			0
the purchase of the narrow street is the latest in a string of extraordinary @entity6 property deals			0
last month , @entity102 's smallest home , which is less than half the size of an average train carriage and measures just 188 sq. ft , was sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds			1
room to improve : the new buyer will be allowed to develop both the area beneath the archway and the small open - air section at the back of the service package , seen in the picture above rubbish real estate : disused cardboard boxes and waste from nearby businesses line the floor of the alleway @entity135 : in this picture taken of the alleyway this week , the property looks far from a comfortable place to live the tiny flat in @entity142 , north @entity6 - which is so compact that the front door opens underneath the bed - went on sale for £ 275,000 and was bought after an extraordinary amount of interest			1
and earlier this month , a one - car garage off the @entity147 in @entity148 , central @entity6 , measuring just 11ft by 7ft , became the @entity102 's most expensive garage when it sold for £ 550,000			1
for the same price , property hunters could buy a pretty semi-detached home with a garden in @entity111			0
the quaint vine - covered house boasts four bedrooms and a ' cottage - style garden '			2
further north , £ 260,000 would fetch a five - bedroom detached home in a picturesque @entity108 village			2
and the buyer would have enough money leftover to make sure that upgrades could be made			0
while those looking to maintain a metropolitan lifestyle could look at the outskirts of @entity167 - where £ 260,000 is enough for a four - bedroom family home with a garage and beautiful conservatory			2
or , if the potential buyer wanted to stay closer to @entity6 , £ 250,000 could buy a two - bedroom bungalow in the popular commuter town of @entity175 , @entity176 - less than an hour from central @entity6 by train			0

the partially - covered 900 sq. ft alleyway is on @entity14 , @entity15
it is wedged next to a busy @entity1 and is currently used for bins
planning permission means it can be converted to a residential space
the average current value of a home in the @entity102 is £ 275,000
