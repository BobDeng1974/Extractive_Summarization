male fish are becoming part female at unusually high rates in three @entity4 rivers , sparking concerns the water is tainted with chemicals			1
male smallmouth bass and white sucker fish carrying eggs in their testes were found in the @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 rivers , according to research from the @entity17			1
researchers have linked the increasing number of intersex fish , or fish with two genders , to a ' complex mix of chemicals ' flowing into waterways from nearby farms			1
research : intersex bass ( with two genders ) are turning up in polluted waterways in the @entity31 region a sign of endocrine disruption : this magnification of a cross-section view of a smallmouth bass ' testes shows immature eggs , which are round circles ' i did not expect to find it quite as widespread , ' @entity17 biologist @entity39 told @entity42			1
' ( with the mutant bass ) we keep seeing ... a correlation with the percent of agriculture in the watershed where we conduct a study			2
' scientists have discovered intersex bass in several areas of the @entity53 , including near the @entity54 , since 2003			1
previous studies detected abnormal levels of chemicals such as herbicides , veterinary pharmaceuticals and manure from farms flowing into the nesting areas of the fish			1
these chemicals disrupt the endocrine system , throwing off functions which regulate hormones and the reproductive system			1
location : studies show a high level of chemicals from animal farms and human waste at bass nesting areas in the @entity53 the @entity42 reported the problem extends beyond the @entity31 , which includes @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity13 and @entity79			1
@entity17 scientists found intersex bass in the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 river basins in 2009			2
however scientists have yet to identify a single chemical responsible for altering a fish 's sexual characteristics			2
a new @entity90 report found there 's a high incidence of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in the @entity31 , and tighter monitoring of fertilizers and other chemicals used at farms is necessary			0
' farmers should more carefully manage these manure and chemical fertilizers , and reduce them in areas where excessive amounts are being applied , ' the report said			0
' @entity104 will need better monitoring data in small sub-watersheds dominated by agriculture to accurately track pollution from farms			0
' last year , democrats in the @entity111 and @entity112 sponsored a pair of bills requiring growers to submit records of their use of insecticides and herbicides to the state			0
researchers welcomed the proposal , saying it would help focus research on chemical ' hot spots '			0
however the requirement was changed when growers said it would be a major financial burden			0
state lawmakers instead passed legislation to create a fund paying for mandatory pesticide reporting in the future			0
meanwhile @entity39 said the presence of intersex fish ' is an indicator that something else is really wrong			2
' ' what are these things doing to the natural environment ? if we find these things in wild organisms , there ’s a good chance they ’re also affecting people , ' she told @entity42 .			0

new study shows male smallmouth bass and white sucker fish in 3 @entity4 rivers have eggs in their testes
this means the male fish are intersex or have two genders
abnormal levels of herbicides , veterinary pharmaceuticals and other chemicals are flowing into their nesting areas
the chemicals disrupt the hormonal and reproductive functions of the fish
