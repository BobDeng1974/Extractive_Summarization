by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 07:28 est , 9 april 2013 life , they say , really kicks off at the age of 40			2
and it appears that for women this really is the case			2
the fairer sex is more content , satisfied and fulfilled when they hit their fifth decade than at any other age - and even feel some 10 years younger than they actually are - according to a new study			1
so stars such as @entity15 ( 45 ) , @entity16 ( 45 ) , @entity17 ( 43 ) , @entity18 ( 40 ) and @entity19 ( 40 ) will be feeling more vibrant and youthful now than they were in their early and mid-thirties			1
actresses @entity15 , left , and @entity16 , right , are both 45 years old more than half of women over 40 ( 55 per cent ) also say they are more confident in their appearance than when they were in their thirties			1
and a 86 per cent insist 40 is now the new 30			0
with many saying they feel rejuvenated , 17 per cent put this down to having a better sex life than ever before , while 27 per cent say their dress sense is better than ever			1
today 's women in their forties are happier in a wider range of clothes than ever			2
the research by health food company @entity37 found nearly two thirds - 59 per cent - still feel confident enough to wear a bikini			1
and 60 per cent insist their generation should still feel happy wearing figure - hugging tops or showing a glimpse of cleavage			1
the study by health food company quizzed 2,000 women aged 40 to 65 about their lives to discover the effect of passing the milestone			2
it seems many insecurities are banished as women hit their forties , with an overwhelming 81 per cent saying they are happier in themselves than younger women			2
actresses @entity18 , left , 40 , and @entity17 , right , 43 , should now feel more confident , secure and happy with themselves than they did a decade ago this may be due to almost a third , 32 per cent , being more financially secure than ever , while 48 per cent said they were in a stable relationship			1
actress @entity57 , 40 , who played @entity58 in @entity59 , said : ' the days when your 40th birthday represented the start of a slow descent into a quiet middle - age are long gone			0
' not only are women of 40 still full of energy , they are enjoying lives full of promise and possibilities			0
' women who are 40 and older are not slowing down , with many having babies , caring for children , supporting their own parents and working hard to maintain careers			0
' at 40 years old both @entity19 , left , and ex-eastender @entity57 , right , should be feeling more like 30 - year - old spring chickens @entity77 from @entity37 said : ' these survey results reinforce that age really is just a number			0
' @entity81 and over are as full of life as ever and feeling fabulous has much more to do with how satisfied you are in life , from organised finances to a healthy diet , small changes can make a huge difference			0
' @entity89 , 44 , a teacher from @entity90 , @entity91 , said : ' i definitely feel better about myself and my life since turning 40			1
' i was more confident in my thirties than in my twenties and more comfortable in myself again now i 'm in my forties			0
' i feel like a stronger person and i care much less what others think			0
i 'm more confident in my work , my relationship and motherhood			0
