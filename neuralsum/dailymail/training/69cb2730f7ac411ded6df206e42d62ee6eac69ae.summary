she said : ' he seemed to be in hospital for weeks , texting most days , saying how much he loved me			0
but even after he was supposedly discharged he claimed he did n't feel ready to see me			2
' all the time she thought @entity49 was getting life - saving treatment , he was actually with his other women			1
he married @entity42 in march 2012 and in another blow to @entity27 , paid for the wedding using money he had stolen from her			1
@entity27 , who has two children from a previous relationship , had given @entity49 valuable family heirlooms to look after			1
he used her £ 30,000 jewellery collection to fund his nuptials , telling his other bride that he had found the bag of gold in his father 's attic			0
@entity27 said : ' it was mainly family heirlooms - hundreds of pieces , including solid gold necklaces , earrings and diamond rings			1
he warned me i should n't leave it lying around in case i got burgled			2

' around the time @entity49 married @entity42 , @entity27 finally suspected he was up to no good but still believed his tumour was the reason they were ' drifting apart '			1

' equally shocked : @entity42 did n't know about @entity27 and said she 's angry @entity7 ' pulled the wool over my eyes ' @entity27 said she 's glad @entity49 is now behind bars so he ' ca n't con anyone else '			1
it was only in court that she discovered he had never been ill and had three other women			2
his wife , care assistant @entity42 , was equally stunned to discover she was not @entity49 's one and only and they are now getting divorced			2
