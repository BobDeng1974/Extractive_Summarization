@entity1 supremo @entity0 has criticised four times world champion @entity2 for the way he reacted to failure this year			1
the @entity5 , who has now left @entity7 for @entity8 , ended the season without a win after dominating the previous four championships			1
@entity7 started the season on the back foot with an uncompetitive and unreliable @entity15 turbo hybrid engine but @entity2 's new @entity17 team mate @entity16 still won three races			2
@entity2 failed to win a race for @entity7 last season and has now left to join @entity8 ' i 'm a super supporter of @entity2 , but i 'm a little bit disappointed with his attitude , which i think has changed , ' @entity0 wrote in the foreword to the official @entity1 season review			1
' he 's acting like a defeated guy , and he is n't - that 's not his mentality , ' added the 84 - year - old			2
@entity0 and @entity2 , who won the last nine races of 2013 , are close and the @entity31 will be happy at least to see the 27 - year - old move to @entity33 after achieving all his success with @entity7			1
@entity8 are going through considerable change and , now on their third team principal of the year , are under pressure to perform after a dismal season in which they too failed to win a race for the first time since 1993			0
' @entity8 was very disappointing , getting lost somewhere , ' said @entity0			0
@entity1 chief @entity0 has admitted his disappointment at @entity2 's attitude last season ' @entity45 ( @entity46 ) got a little bit like @entity2 halfway through , so i 'm a little disappointed in him , too			1
' @entity49 @entity46 has made way for @entity2 and is now expected to join @entity51 , who have not won a race since 2012			0
@entity54 won both titles this year , with @entity56 taking his second driver 's championship , but @entity0 said the sport had been lucky the @entity31 and his @entity5 team mate @entity60 were allowed to race each other			0
' it 's good that @entity54 allowed them to do that , ' he said			0
' if not , we would have had a really lousy championship			0

@entity2 has left @entity7 for @entity8 after failing to win last season
@entity0 believes the @entity5 acted ' like a defeated guy '
@entity1 chief also *expresses* disappointment at performance of @entity8
