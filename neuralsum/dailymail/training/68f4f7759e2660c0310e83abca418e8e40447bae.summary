by @entity0 published : 01:54 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 05:21 est , 13 january 2014 when authorities searched the apartment of @entity6 gangster @entity5 , they found $ 822,000 in cash and a large collection of guns hidden in holes cut into the walls			1
other than the cash , there were few valuables			0
books , hats , sweatshirts and household items bought at discount stores filled the rent - controlled @entity19 , @entity21 , apartment the notorious crime boss shared with his longtime girlfriend while he was on the run			1
proceeds of crime : @entity26 ' @entity5 , captured in @entity19 , @entity21 , after 16 years on the run but authorities are hoping they can attract buyers for @entity5 's belongings so they can compensate his victims			1
@entity5 's possessions will be sold to the highest bidders during a criminal forfeiture auction expected to be held over the next few months			1
prosecutors in @entity38 attorney @entity37 's office are now trying to decide which of @entity5 's belongings should be auctioned			1
they are trying to balance their desire to compensate relatives of @entity5 's murder victims with avoiding @entity43 or his crimes and staying within the boundaries of good taste			1
' we want to certainly be able to obtain funds to go back to the victims who were harmed by @entity5 , but we do n't want to do that in a way that glorifies @entity5 or potentially causes some offense to the victims or others who have been impacted by @entity5 , ' said assistant u.s. attorney @entity55			1
@entity5 was convicted in august of orchestrating or participating in 11 killings during his reign as leader of the @entity59			2
he was sentenced to two life terms plus five years in prison			0
the cash and proceeds from the auction will be split among the estates of murder victims who choose to participate and several extortion victims			2
there are a few things likely to bring in a substantial amount of money , including a gold and diamond claddagh ring with an estimated appraised value of $ 48,000 , a replica of a 1986 @entity78 championship ring and a 40 - inch flat - screen tv			1
but most of the items found in the apartment @entity5 shared with @entity83 are ordinary things that have no intrinsic value			1
authorities are hoping they could appeal to crime memorabilia collectors or other buyers			0
there 's a rat - shaped cup used to hold pens and scissors , a collection of books about the mob and @entity5 's gang , an assortment of cat figurines and ' @entity101 ' magazines			1
there are also @entity103 and @entity105 cards @entity106 sent to @entity5			2
modest : the apartment in which @entity5 hid with his girlfriend had few items of value authorities have n't yet decided whether personal items should be auctioned , @entity55 said			1
' it 's looking at those items that on their own do n't have value and which of those would be appropriate to auction , knowing that they would sell only because of who owned them , ' she said			1
' it 's definitely a question of balance			0
' families of @entity5 's victims have mixed feelings about the upcoming auction			1
@entity5 was convicted of gunning down @entity128 's husband , @entity127 , in 1982 while targeting a different man who offered him a ride home that night			2
she said she is n't opposed to the auction			2
' i ca n't imagine anybody wanting his things , but if they can sell them and make money and give the money to the victims , i think that 's great			2
i 'm sure a lot of the victims can use the money , ' she said			2
peaceful retirement : @entity26 ' @entity5 pictured with his then - girlfriend @entity145 in this undated photo but @entity147 said he does n't like the idea of an auction			1
the jury was unable to reach a decision on whether @entity5 was responsible for his sister @entity152 ' death			2
' i wish they would burn everything right in front of all of us , ' @entity147 said			0
' they should just destroy everything			0
that would kill the memories we have of him			0
' @entity164 , assistant chief inspector of the asset forfeiture division of the @entity166 , said the program has two goals : to compensate victims and to deter future criminal activity			0
' it 's a very important piece of the law enforcement process			0
compensating victims is paramount in our program , ' he said			0
auctions in other high - profile cases have brought in millions			0
the @entity166 , which is responsible for selling seized and forfeited properties , raised $ 232,000 through a 2011 online auction of @entity182 's belongings , including 20 personal journals and the hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses depicted in his famous @entity187 sketch			2
this photo provided by the @entity38 attorney 's office shows inside @entity191 and @entity83 's apartment at the princess @entity194 complex , in @entity19 a two - day auction in @entity196 in 2011 brought in $ 3.2 million in the case of convicted financier @entity198 to compensate victims of his $ 65 billion @entity200			1
the sales included fine jewelry , coins and even 14 pairs of @entity198 's underwear			0
@entity207 , an online retailer who bought some of @entity198 's clothing at the auction , said he thought @entity198 's status would attract buyers , but he does n't expect @entity5 's possessions to draw much interest			1
' @entity198 was more of a celebrity			0
@entity5 was a downright killer , ' he said			0
' i do n't even want anything of his			0
' @entity5 , now 84 , fled @entity6 in 1994 after being tipped by a former @entity187 agent that he was about to be indicted			0
he was finally captured with @entity106 in 2011 .			0
