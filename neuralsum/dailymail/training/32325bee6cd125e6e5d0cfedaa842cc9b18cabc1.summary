by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 13:19 est , 2 may 2013 children who spend more time playing outside are less likely to suffer from short - sightedness			1
two new studies have added to the body of evidence that daylight plays an important role in preventing the condition			1
it is not known why daylight is important but some experts believe levels of the brain chemical dopamine play a role			2
high levels of dopamine in the eyeball have been associated with a lower risk of short - sightedness			1
until recently it was thought that short - sightedness was inherited , but scientists are discovering that other factors , such as sunlight exposure , play a role short - sightedness , or myopia , is an eye condition that causes a person to see things clearly close - up but struggle to see things when they are far away			1
in childhood it is correctable , but it is also linked to the development of severe forms of the eye disorder in adulthood , which increases the risks for potentially blinding diseases such as glaucoma and retinal detachment			0
research on short - sightedness is intensifying as the condition nears epidemic status in @entity45 and other regions , primarily in developed countries			1
shockingly , it has increased by more than 65 per cent since 1970 in the @entity49			1
although it often inherited , researchers are now assessing environmental factors to help explain why rates are rising so rapidly in some populations			0
the @entity56 study observed 333 students who spent their break between lessons in the playground			0
these children , many of whom had formerly spent recess indoors , now spent a total of 80 minutes per day outdoors			0
@entity56 scientists are suggesting enforced outdoor playtimes would help stem the growing number of children who suffer with shortsightedness			0
the condition has rocketed by nearly 65 % since 1970 in the @entity49 a nearby school acted as the control group because children were not forced to spend their break outdoors			1
students at both schools received eye examinations at the study outset and one year later			0
the results showed that significantly fewer children became short - sighted or shifted toward short - sightedness in the school that required outdoor breaks , compared with the control school			1
the researchers recommended that primary schools should add frequent breaks and other outdoor activities to their daily schedules to help protect children 's eye development and vision			0
‘ because children spend a lot of time in school , a school - based intervention [ such as an outdoors break ] is a direct and practical way to tackle the increasing prevalence of myopia , ’ said the leader of the study , @entity96 - @entity95 , of @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity56			2
a separate study on the impact of daylight exposure on eye development analysed data collected in a 2005 clinical trial that included 235 @entity114 school children with short - sightedness			1
of the children who played outside , significantly fewer became short - sighted or shifted toward short - sightedness , compared with the control school participants were divided into seven groups , each of which represented a different time of year			1
because daylight hours fluctuate dramatically with the seasons in @entity114 - from seven hours in winter to nearly 18 in summer - access to daylight was distinct for each group			2
@entity128 eye length – the distance from the front to the back of the eye – and vision were tested in each group of children at the beginning and end of their seasonal interval			0
axial length is an important measurement because elongation of the eye shows that myopia is worsening			0
in the children with access to the fewest hours of daylight , eye growth averaged 0.19 mm ; in those with access to the most daylight , eye growth was just 0.12 mm. ‘ our results indicate that exposure to daylight helps protect children from myopia , ’ said the leader of the study , @entity153 of @entity155 , @entity156			2
‘ parents should encourage [ children ] to spend time outdoors daily			0
‘ when that 's impractical due to weather or other factors , use of daylight - spectrum indoor lights should be considered as a way to minimize myopia			2
’ both studies were published in @entity172 , the journal of the @entity174 .			0

short - sightedness has increased by over 65 *percent* since 1970 in the @entity49
playing outside made children less likely to develop short - sightedness
those exposed to the least amount of daylight had elongated eyeballs , which causes the condition
