billionaire @entity0 has created a new company that will launch satellites and people into space from the world 's biggest plane			1
the @entity8 co-founder this week unveiled ' @entity9 ' , which will look after the space programs of @entity11			1
this includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft ( 117 metres )			1
@entity0 , the @entity8 co-founder this week unveiled ' @entity9 ' , which will look after the space programs of @entity11			1
this includes an ambitious project to launch spacecraft and probes into orbit from of a huge carrier aircraft with a wingspan of 385ft ( 117 metres ) the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from @entity28			1
this will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite			2
initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity28			1
@entity0 's vision is to create a giant air pad in the sky , allowing payloads to reach space faster and at a lower cost than existing technologies			2
the @entity11 carrier aircraft will be powered by six 747 - class engines , is currently being assembled at @entity43 , @entity44			1
initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity28			1
the plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude , avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from @entity28			1
the company will ' shift how the world conceptualises space travel through cost reduction and on ‚Äê demand access , ' according to @entity9 president @entity53 who made a presentation in @entity55 this week			2
the @entity11 project was inspired by @entity57 which won the $ 10 million @entity58 in 2004 for becoming the first privately funded manned vehicle to reach space			1
' @entity11 's ability to launch from variable locations will enable satellites and humans to be efficiently inserted into their most optimal orbit at a time of the customer 's choosing , ' @entity53 wrote			1
the @entity11 carrier aircraft 's 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for @entity71 and 225 feet for @entity72 earlier this year , the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit			1
picture is its twin fuselage sections ' launching far away from populated areas ( i.e. middle of the ocean ) also significantly reduces public safety risk			0
the @entity11 carrier plane is on track to make its first test flight in 2016 , according to @entity89			1
the rocket is being developed by @entity91 , and the designs uses solid - fuel lower stages and an upper stage powered by @entity96 engines			1
but according to @entity97 , @entity53 indicated that the company is also looking at other launch vehicle options			0
@entity100 : 385 feet ( 117 metres ) engines : six 747 - class engines fuselage length : 238 feet ( 72 metres ) weight : 1,200,000 lb ( 544,311 kg ) maximum speed : 460 knots , 530 mph ( 850 km / h ) maiden launch : flight testing will begin in 2016			1
the first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018			0
satellite delivery : initially , the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity28			1
launch sites : several sites are under consideration , including @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
an animation of the moment the @entity11 carrier aircraft delivers a rocket high into @entity28 's atmosphere before it goes into orbit each of the twin fuselages of the the @entity11 carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and , when complete , will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels ' what we really want to do is focus on a lower - cost propulsion system that is evolvable in some fashion , ' he said			1
' we 're still looking at @entity91 as a potential option , ' he said			0
' we 're widening our aperture to see if this is the right path forward			0
' @entity11 could someday support several launch vehicles , he said			2
as a result , @entity11 said it is temporarily halting work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the @entity91 booster			2
that company added that it is deferring work on a crewed vehicle that would launch on the @entity91 booster to focus more heavily on getting the @entity11 carrier aircraft off the ground			1
the world received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane			0
its 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the @entity71 and 225 feet for the @entity72			1
pictured is one of its twin fuslage sections rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by @entity160 , a @entity161 tv station , show its huge size , according to a report by @entity164 in @entity165			0
hours after unveiling its next - generation ' @entity9 ' rocket this week , @entity166 ( @entity166 ) , ran into its first problem - the rocket 's name			0
' @entity9 is a trademark of @entity9 and we have informed @entity166 of our trademark rights , ' @entity53 , president of the @entity0 - backed @entity9 , told @entity175			0
' @entity0 and @entity9 were early leaders within space exploration with the launch of @entity57 more than a decade ago			0
we are flattered by @entity166 's tribute to our legacy by naming their new rocket ' @entity9 ' , ' @entity53 said			0
@entity166 , a joint venture of @entity183 and @entity184 , selected @entity9 as the name of its new booster , which will be developed in phases beginning in 2019 , after it won more than 1 million votes in a crowdsourcing initiative			0
' we have done our due diligence regarding the legal right to use the name @entity9 , ' @entity166 spokeswoman @entity190 wrote in an email			0
' @entity166 is committed to taking every reasonable step to avoid any confusion with other entities using this name and we are confident we can do so , ' she said			0
the images show one of the two twin fuselage sections under assembly			0
in the news report , @entity204 president @entity203 says the company has so far built ' roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure ' for the vehicle			0
instead of a satellite , the @entity11 airplane could launch a @entity212 spaceship , which would be outfitted with an as - yet - unspecified upper - stage rocket motor			2
' @entity212 seemed to be the logical way to go , ' @entity11 executive director @entity214 said in october			2
the @entity11 carrier aircraft 's 385 feet ( 117 metres ) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the @entity71 and 225 feet for the @entity72			1
each of the twin fuselages of the @entity11 carrier aircraft is 238 feet long and , when complete , will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels			2
@entity11 has produced computer - generated images and videos of the aircraft , but the tv footage was the first time images of the real vehicle have been shown			2
@entity0 has previously said his project would ' keep @entity230 at the forefront of space exploration and give a new generation of children something to dream about '			0
several companies are competing to develop spacecraft to deliver cargo and astronauts to the @entity240			0
the @entity8 billionaire criticised the fact that government - sponsored space programmes are waning			2
@entity244 is paying @entity72 and @entity245 to build the capsules and fly them from @entity247 , which has n't seen a manned launch since the shuttles retired in 2011			0

new company will look after the space programs of @entity11
this includes plane which has a wingspan of 385 feet ( 117 metres )
it will be powered by six 747 - class engines during first flight in 2016
will initially deliver satellites weighing up to 13,500lbs ( 6,124 kg ) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles ( 180 km and 2000 km ) above @entity28
