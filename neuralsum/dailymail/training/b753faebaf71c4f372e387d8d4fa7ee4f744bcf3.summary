@entity0 , all tribal tattoos and rippling muscles , is seen as the human wrecking ball of the @entity5 rugby squad set to play @entity6 in @entity7 today			1
recognised around the world as one of the most exciting talents in the game , the 6ft and @entity12 will be hoping to make a huge impact on this year ’s @entity15 tournament following his return from injury			1
but back in the small beach village of @entity20 , on the @entity22 island of @entity23 where he grew up , the 21 - year - old is far from being the most conspicuous member of the @entity0 clan			1
for there it is his equally strapping 6ft brother @entity28 who catches the eye – dressed as a woman and known as @entity31			1
night out : @entity0 is close to his cross-dressing brother , who calls himself @entity31 @entity31 is the third eldest of seven boys in the @entity0 family – five of whom have professional rugby careers , including @entity12 , the youngest , who plays for @entity39			1
@entity31 , 34 , has previously shied away from media attention			1
but now in her first interview , given exclusively to @entity42 , she has told of her delight when @entity12 buys her make - up and designer handbags			1
and she explains how she has steered clear of the sport which dominates her family – happy instead to stay at home and do the ironing for her elderly parents			2
‘ @entity52 in my life have i played rugby , ’ she shudders			2
‘ i ’m not a very rugby lady			2
my favourite sport is netball			1
however , if i played professional rugby then i would do better than the others			2
i am a very strong woman ! ’ she may joke about her physical strength , but @entity31 – who enjoys strutting around in perilous stilettos and has a passion for glamorous dresses – certainly exhibits a stoutness of character			1
in the @entity65 , @entity31 would be described as a transvestite and her striking looks would command significant attention			1
but in @entity22 , she attracts barely a second glance because of the deep - rooted @entity71 culture of the fa’afafine , or third gender , which defies @entity75 sexual conventions			1
back home : @entity0 's brother , pictured here , as cross-dresser @entity31 known for their hard work and dedication to the family , the fa’afafine – which translates simply as ‘ in the manner of woman ’ – are ubiquitous in the @entity86 nation			1
born male , they are said to embody both genders and can have relationships with both men and , less commonly , women			0
@entity31 remains silent on her relationships and will only bashfully describe them as ‘ confidential ’			1
but she resolved from a very young age to live as a woman , apparently without @entity97 grew up knowing she was different in a well - respected family			1
her father , @entity99 , was a former politician and the high chief of the village council , while her mother , @entity102 , ran the local food shop			0
‘ i was born a fa’afafine , ’ @entity31 explains , simply			1
‘ i realised i was a fa’afafine when i was really young			0
‘ when i grew up , i did lots of girly things			0
i wore a girl ’s dress and my parents let my hair grow long , even when i was at primary school			0
’ it is inconceivable to most parents in @entity65 that their son could happily attend school dressed as a girl			0
but in @entity22 , @entity31 says , it was unremarkable			1
‘ i always played with girls and i always hung around with them			0
there were lots of my fa’afafine friends who used to go to school together			0
‘ my parents understand the life of fa’afafine , they understand and accept me – the boys do too			0
‘ i feel sorry for those people who discriminate against us			0
we do not have a problem – they are the ones with the problem			0
’ in a recent interview , @entity12 said of @entity31 : ‘ it ’s just the way he is			1
he was born like that and he wants to dress up as a woman			2
but not just dress up , he lives the life of a woman – he has the eyelashes , eyebrows , has make - up done and wears a bra			1
he ’s our brother and a great guy			2
’ growing up , @entity31 dedicated herself to helping her parents around the house , taking on the role of dutiful daughter			1
it is a respected part of the fa’afafine tradition and @entity31 has accepted it gladly			1
‘ i cook for them , i tidy , i iron their clothes			0
that ’s the life of a fa’afafine in @entity22 , ’ she explains			1
‘ they help and do everything in the family			0
’ @entity31 is , in effect , gay as she is attracted to men			1
some of @entity31 ’s friends have embarked on surgery to become more feminine and to formally change genders			1
@entity31 has not so far made this decision , but has not ruled it out			1
‘ some of my fa’afafine friends have had their full operation and got married			0
i have n’t had any surgery but maybe in the future , if i want to			0
‘ for me , i would rather stay alone and keep myself as a princess rather than become a slave of some kind			0
if i am thinking of getting married , then i ’m getting married to a man			0
i have n’t made up my mind			0
i want to stay alone at the moment			0
’ despite her domestic commitments , @entity31 has an openly flamboyant side			1
‘ of course i dress up , ’ she admits			0
‘ when we go out , i dress up like a princess , i dress up like a model			0
everywhere i go – nightclubs , town – i dress up like a supermodel			0
it ’s my personal choice			0
‘ @entity12 and i are very close			2
we respect each other because we are from a very respected family			0
without them , i would never dress up like this			0
‘ i ’m the only princess in the @entity0 family , but if @entity12 wants to wear one of my dresses that ’s all right , no problem			1
’ but while @entity31 enjoys nightclubs , she also holds some deeply rooted religious beliefs			2
the @entity0 family are regular churchgoers and , when @entity31 spent the period between 2003 and 2006 living in @entity39 with her rugby - playing brothers , their parents would ring on sundays to make sure they were going to church			1
in action @entity5 rugby international @entity0 is making a name for himself for the national team , while his cross-dressing brother is a big name back home at the time , @entity207 and @entity208 were playing for @entity39 , a third brother @entity209 was also living in @entity39 , and @entity210 was playing in @entity211			1
it is clear that living as a woman , in the body of a muscular , tall @entity22 man in the middle of @entity39 , was particularly hard			1
‘ discrimination was worse when i was in @entity5 , ’ she admits			2
‘ when i met some people , i could tell by their body language that they rejected me			0
i could tell that , when i left , they would be talking behind my back			0
‘ i would always stand in the vip queue at @entity225 in @entity39			0
people would ask me why i would stand in that line and i would answer , “ because i ’m the vip girl ”			0
’ these days , @entity31 has returned to @entity22 , where she and her parents live in a three - bedroomed home			1
life is far easier in a @entity22 culture where she is understood			2
‘ we have a big fa’afafine association here , ’ says @entity31			2
‘ we have a beauty pageant annually and we donate all the money to those who have special needs			0
lots of my friends are fa’afafine , but i can be friends with anyone			0
‘ i am very happy as the kind of person i am			0
’ it is also surprisingly easy for @entity31 to buy clothes			2
‘ most of the goods in @entity22 are imported from @entity250 so they have sizes for fa’afafine			2
i know how to maintain my body			0
’ meanwhile , @entity12 has built his rugby reputation			1
he began playing with @entity257 ’s youth team while living in @entity258 in 2004 , after brother @entity259 switched to the @entity260			2
at 15 , @entity12 moved back to @entity39 , winning a place at the @entity39 academy , but after three years and on the verge of signing a professional contract , it was discovered that he had long overstayed his six - month tourist visa			1
the rest of his family were here legally , and local politicians and the local newspaper lobbied to keep @entity12 in the @entity65 on the basis that he had the potential to play for @entity5			1
he finally won indefinite leave to remain in july 2010 and in august 2011 made his @entity5 debut			2
he was later selected for @entity5 ’s @entity275 squad for the tournament in @entity277			2
his decision to play for @entity5 , rather than @entity22 , caused some controversy back in his homeland , but @entity31 is still incredibly proud			1
‘ @entity12 has made history			2
it ’s a rare opportunity for any islander to play in the @entity5 team			2
’ in fact , @entity31 is proud of all her rugby - playing brothers			1
‘ when they play , they put all their heart and effort into it , with the talent that @entity293 gave them			0
when they come home , we live like a normal family			0
we joke , we play , we party , we go out			0
‘ my relationship with @entity12 and my brothers is fine			2
we enjoy being together and they respect me			0
‘ they buy me designer handbags on my birthday , like @entity306 or @entity307			0
@entity12 got me a big box of cosmetics from @entity310			2
he also gave me @entity312 perfume and some handbags			0
’ @entity31 will be watching when @entity5 play @entity6 today in their @entity15 clash , and it is clear there are no hard feelings between @entity22 and its famous son			1
‘ i am very excited about the @entity15			0
we are all proud of @entity12 , ’ @entity31 says			1
‘ all my relatives and the people of my village cheer for @entity5 because they know @entity12 is their flag - carrier			1
‘ we are all for @entity5 here when @entity12 ’s playing			1
