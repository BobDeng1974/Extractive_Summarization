@entity2 - @entity1 women have to eat fewer calories or take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight as @entity8 women from their genes to the speed of their metabolism , people come up with an enormous range of excuses for their failure to shed their extra pounds			1
now , new research suggests ethnicity could be a valid explanation for dieting disasters			0
researchers discovered @entity2 - @entity1 women have to eat fewer calories and take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight as their @entity8 counterparts			1
scientists at the @entity25 believe this is because they have slower metabolic rates			0
during their study , they found @entity2 - @entity1 women lost , on average , 7lbs less than @entity8 women on the same diet			1
previous studies have shown that black women do not lose as much weight as white women when they diet			2
dr @entity36 , associate professor at the @entity37 at @entity38 , explained : ‘ at first , it was thought that perhaps the @entity2 - @entity1 women did n’t adhere as closely to their calorie prescriptions or that the interventions were not culturally sensitive			2
‘ but even in research projects that were designed to address those possibilities , the difference in weight loss remained			0
’ dr @entity36 ’s team decided to see if there were metabolic reasons behind the discrepancy			0
they examined body weight changes , energy expenditure , physical activity and calorie intake in 39 severely obese african - american and 66 @entity8 women who were participating in a six - month weight loss programme			2
they measured body composition and daily energy expenditure at the beginning and end of the diet and assessed physical activity levels			0
the researchers found the @entity2 - @entity1 women lost about seven pounds fewer than the @entity8 women , even though their starting body mass index measures were comparable and they stuck as closely to the calorie restriction and exercise regime			1
@entity2 - @entity1 women have slower metabolisms than @entity8 women , meaning they find dieting harder the @entity2 - @entity1 women had lower resting metabolic rates and expended less energy daily than the other group			1
‘ we prescribe how many calories are allowed and how much activity is needed during weight loss interventions based on the premise that people of the same weight have similar metabolic rates , ’ dr @entity36 explained			0
‘ but to account for their lower metabolic rate , @entity2 - @entity1 women must further reduce the number of calories they eat , or use up more of them with exercise , in order to lose the same number of pounds in the same time span as a @entity8 woman of the same weight			1

this means they have to eat fewer calories or take more exercise to lose the same amount of weight
researchers found that @entity2 - @entity1 women lost , on average , 7lbs less than @entity8 women on the same diet
