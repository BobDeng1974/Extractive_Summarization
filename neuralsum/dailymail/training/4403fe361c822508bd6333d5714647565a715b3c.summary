@entity1 striker @entity0 has revealed the pain he caused @entity4 captain @entity3 when he told him he was leaving @entity5 for @entity6 three years ago			1
the striker signed for @entity1 in a £ 50million deal in january 2011 , on the same day @entity4 signed @entity9 from @entity10 for £ 35m			1
@entity0 scored 81 goals in 142 games for the @entity13 , playing arguably the best football of his career and even though his form dipped at the end of time there , the @entity5 faithful was understandably miffed to see him leave - as , it seems , was @entity3			1
@entity22 to watch how many attempts does it take @entity0 to score past @entity24 ? good times : @entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 celebrate a goal during the @entity28 's time at @entity4 euphoria : @entity0 says he doubts that he 'll ever find a team - mate as compatible to his style of play as @entity3 ' one day , @entity3 came to say to me , " @entity0 , now , you have to think of yourself			1
do what you have to do " , ' @entity0 told @entity36 magazine @entity35			2
' but when i went to tell him that i was going to accept the @entity1 offer , it destroyed him			2
announcing my departure from @entity4 to @entity3 was one of the most difficult moments of my career			1
' he was my best team - mate and i am not sure of finding another like him in the future			1
we were made for each other			2
' @entity0 added that he felt he had to leave @entity4 at that time in order to win trophies			1
key departures : @entity0 says @entity4 failed to replace @entity50 ( left ) and @entity51 adequately ' at @entity4 , i had almost everything but titles			2
there , i felt like a king but the team was falling apart			0
' the directors had sold [ @entity50 ] @entity50 to @entity57 , then @entity51 to @entity58 without investing any of the money to compensate for the departure of these two key players			0
' i was 27 , i wanted to know what it was like to lift the @entity64 and i had the feeling it was not going to happen with @entity4			2
' then they were in full transition , the club was being sold and in that case , unless you are @entity71 or @entity72 , it can be a long road before you are again competitive			0
' struggle : despite winning the @entity64 , things have n't worked out at @entity1 for @entity0 and even though @entity0 went on to realise his dream of lifting the @entity64 with @entity1 , his form has been patchy and as a result , he was in and out of the team under the management of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
' at the time , @entity85 and myself went to see @entity81 together because we had been the last arrivals , we were told we would be important , but , in reality , we were n't playing			0
they finished by saying to us : ' we are going to finish the season with the team that started it '			0
'' i understood nothing of what had happened			0
i started to know the experience of the bench			0
i reassured myself by saying things would soon change			0
@entity82 arrived , then @entity83 but it was always the same : one day i played , the next not			0
