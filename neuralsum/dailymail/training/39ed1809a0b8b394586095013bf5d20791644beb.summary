by @entity0 it is the size of a small cat and enough to strike fear into anyone who sees it – but it could become a common sight in cities around the country			1
a giant rat was caught in @entity10 and measured two feet long from its nose to its tail			1
the menacing super rat was caught on an industrial estate by a pest controller from @entity17 , one of the country 's largest independent pest prevention companies			1
huge rats are being caught across @entity22 ( file picture ) @entity17 has offices in @entity25 , @entity10 and @entity26 and all locations report a rise in the number of super rats spotted			1
pest control experts today warned that similar rats are likely to become more common in the @entity22 as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish , and discard left - over fast food			1
they also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison			1
experts say the conventional blood - thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to			1
now pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its response to the monster - size vermin and asking the @entity46 to approve stronger ‘ third generation poison ’ to kill them			1
@entity51 pest controller @entity49 from @entity17 told @entity52 : ‘ we ’re seeing an upsurge in rat call - outs , it ’s gone up significantly by about 15 per cent over the past year			1
‘ it ’s been very good for us			0
but i ’m not entirely sure what ’s causing it , it could be the weather , it ’s been very cold and it ’s been very wet			0
‘ they ’re twice as large as they once were			0
it ’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat			2
growing problem : cities throughout the @entity22 are seeing more super rats as the rodents gorge on food left out in bins ‘ the problem is that they ’re feeding more than they used to			1
they ’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away			0
‘ if there is vermin , 99.9 per cent of the time it ’s our fault			0
we ’re basically feeding them and they get used to it			0
so they keep coming around us to get more food , ' he added			0
mr @entity49 said : ‘ the rats that we ’re seeing in the city used to be the ones roaming round the countryside , in agriculture , out on farms , but they ’ve migrated to towns – now they live in the city			0
we found you : this huge rodent had to be removed by hand from the ceiling after the trap failed to work due to its size in @entity106 mr @entity49 said the ' monster rats ' are in every town throughout the country but there has been an increase in sightings in @entity10 , @entity113 and @entity25			1
during the 1960s onwards , rat poison was based on the blood - thinning agent warfarin			2
it worked by draining the blood from the rat and killing it			0
today , pest controllers use bromadiolone , but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin			1
‘ we find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison , ' mr whelan said			2
' we used to use @entity126 when i first started out 23 years ago			0
it was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but does n't do much now			0
' we need new , stronger poisons as they 've grown used to what we use			0
' the pest controller explained that in an area between @entity134 and @entity135 the poisons simply do not work at all , while rats in @entity25 have also developed a higher immunity			2
mr @entity49 is calling on the government to create a ' rat tsar ' to tackle the problem			2
he also wants the @entity46 to approve the third generation of rat poison to help tackle the problem , but plans for stronger poison face stiff opposition from campaigners amid fears that it could be harmful to humans			1
wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds			0
however , pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops , restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats			1
big rodent : the giant monster rat was found in a family residence in @entity168 , south @entity106 last week rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the @entity22 has seen plenty during the wettest year on record			1
vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city			0
the government ’s austerity measures have been blamed for making the problem far worse – after cuts to the budget for pest control			0
and rats can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans , including @entity185 ’s disease , which has flu - like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure			0
across the country , councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported			2
@entity113 has the highest number of call - outs with 5,100 in the past year			0
@entity10 council has also reported a recent rise in the number of reports of rats – 2,008 last year compared with 1,860 in 2012			1
in @entity113 the rat hotspots include @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			0
@entity206 pest control officer @entity205 said that one of the biggest he ’s seen was 14 or 15 inches long but that was just the body , without the tail			2
he claimed that it would have been over 2 foot with its tail and compared it to the size of a small cat			2
and the problem is not just confined to @entity22			2
other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in @entity219 and @entity106 , where one rat was trapped by pest control after terrorising an @entity223 family in south @entity106			1
the @entity106 - based ' monster vermin ' had been terrorising @entity226 and @entity227 ’ home in @entity168 shortly after they moved into their new flat			0
one for supper : @entity230 , owned by @entity232 resident @entity231 , caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country			1

pest controllers are seeing rats the ' size of small cats ' cropping up in cities across the @entity22
a monster rat two feet long was caught and killed in @entity10
rodents up and down the country are becoming immune to poison
pest controllers are calling on the @entity46 to approve stronger poison to kill the rodents
