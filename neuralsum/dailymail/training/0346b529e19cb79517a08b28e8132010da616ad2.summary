a survey by health campaigners found that nearly three quarters of all restaurants and takeaway pizzas - 586 out of 802 - surveyed contain more salt than recommended for a day			1
pizzas sold by supermarkets were better , however some still contain relatively high levels for a single meal			1
a @entity42 came in 7.2g , and the store ’s @entity43 measured 5.8g			0
the now - discontinued @entity19 ’s @entity18 ( pictured ) also had 16g of salt , which is some 2.7 times more than the 6g maximum recommended for an adult for an entire day generally , a customer will eat a whole pizza , however retailers give their nutrition label information based on the assumption that consumers will eat only half or less , which can be misleading			1

‘ with three - quarters of our salt intakes coming from processed foods such as pizza , how are any of us able to choose a healthier diet ? we need the food industry to help us improve our diet , not to hide 3 times more salt than is recommended in a day in a single pizza			1
’ the @entity60 chairman , @entity105 , the professor of cardiovascular medicine at @entity107 , said : ‘ eating too much salt puts up our blood pressure , the major cause of strokes , heart attacks and heart failure , the leading cause of death and disability worldwide			0
‘ at the @entity119 in may 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day , by 2025			0
‘ our survey has shown that many pizza manufacturers are still adding very large and completely unnecessary amounts of salt to their pizzas			0
this is completely unacceptable and our advice is to avoid eating pizzas from these manufacturers			0
’ researchers also looked at pizzas sold in other countries and found even higher levels			0
the saltiest pizza surveyed is the @entity136 sold in the @entity137 which contains 23.6g salt per large pizza			0
the study found some stores and brands are able to provide pizza with lower salt levels			0
for example , a @entity145 from @entity136 comes in at 1.67g ; a @entity147 from @entity148 is 0.6g salt and a @entity150 ( @entity151 ) from ask @entity152 is 1.8g			0
