while 3d printers are still too expensive for most of us , a @entity1 project is hoping to fund a cheaper alternative - a pen capable of drawing 3d structures			1
called @entity7 , the $ 50 ( £ 32 ) pen writes using a plastic wire that hardens almost instantly on being cooled by a fan built in to the pen 's tip. it is hoped it will go on sale later this year , and the firm has already given prototypes to artists to create everything from @entity21 animals to reconstructions of the @entity23			1
