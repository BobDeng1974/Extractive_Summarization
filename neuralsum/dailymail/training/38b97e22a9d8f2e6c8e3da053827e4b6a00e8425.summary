there are simply no excuses for @entity2 not performing on saturday			1
this group of players have been together in camp for more than a month and they should be able to recite the patterns and game plan they ’re looking to deliver in their sleep			2
the coaches should have been able to get their message across by now			0
if they have n’t , there ’s a problem			0
for @entity16 and his team the time is now , not tomorrow , not next year , not the @entity18			0
i have heard far too much talk about this being a young team with one eye on the next @entity18			0
i ’ve heard that players are learning the ropes of international rugby and building on the experience			0
it ’s time to stop talking like that			0
@entity16 's @entity2 team must deliver against the @entity30 at @entity31 on saturday @entity16 has left experienced players such as @entity34 winger @entity33 out of his recent plans @entity36 ( right ) has been in excellent form for @entity34 but has been overlooked by @entity38 @entity16 has placed his faith in the likes @entity41 ( above ) for the current autumn series this is @entity38 ’s team			1
he selects it , he coaches it			0
they are his picks and anyone selected for @entity2 should be ready to deliver			1
international rugby is not a training ground			0
there are experienced players such as @entity33 , @entity36 and @entity53 playing very well for their clubs but @entity38 has opted for youth with players such as @entity57 , @entity41 and @entity58 in the back line and @entity60 and @entity61 up front			1
you ca n’t then use that inexperience as an excuse for poor performances and bad results			0
indeed , it is these supposedly inexperienced guys who have been the highlights of the autumn to date			2
@entity71 feels his @entity73 team - mate @entity72 ( right ) was made a scapegoat for @entity2 's poor form this is @entity38 ’s team and they need to start performing			1
in many ways i think international rugby has become distracted by @entity81			0
yes , it is the biggest , most prestigious prize in the game and winning the @entity18 is incredible			2
it is the ultimate but i can not overstate just how much i used to love beating the big teams at @entity31 or in their own backyard — none more so than @entity30			1
history shows the best way to prepare for a @entity18 is to prove you are the best team in the world			2
that is only achieved with the attitude of every game being a must - win match			2
i fear this attitude has been lost			0
@entity2 will have their hands full containing the outstanding @entity30 fullback @entity98 ( above ) there will be 82,000 people at @entity31 to watch one of sport ’s greatest rivalries			1
it does n’t get much bigger than @entity2 against @entity30			1
compare this contest with the lukewarm qualification matches the @entity2 football team have to play			1
test match rugby is amazing			0
of course , everything has been put into perspective by the tragic death of young @entity113 cricketer @entity112 and when things like that happen it makes everyone sit back and take stock			0
but i ’m sure @entity112 , brilliant sportsman that he was , would have wanted his friends in the @entity30 dressing room to put on a great show against an @entity2 team who have not shown any real sign of progress so far this autumn			1
some observers have pointed to the fact that @entity2 have faced the two strongest teams in the world and only been narrowly beaten			1
@entity58 impressed for @entity2 against the @entity130 in difficult conditions at @entity31 i hear that , but my problem is with how they have played			1
it ’s their performance that is the real issue : we ’ve only seen a couple of flashes of individual brilliance			0
we need a display that will get the @entity31 crowd — and the watching millions — on their feet			0
there are two ways @entity2 can win this game			1
the first would be if the @entity113 scrum does n’t turn up and we win the game through penalty tries , sin bins and three - pointers			1
i hope this does n’t happen , not just for the sake of the @entity31 crowd , but because it will merely paper over the cracks			0
the second is through great confrontation up front and swift , decisive execution in the backs			0
this is a massive game for @entity165 at 10			0
the fly - half is the general of the side and i want to see him bossing today ’s game in precisely the same way he does for @entity171			1
in @entity172 , @entity53 and @entity173 he is keeping some very good players out of the side but he is absolutely capable of leading this @entity2 team			1
i expect the @entity2 pack to be the defining factor and to smash @entity30 up front , but this in no way diminishes @entity165 ’s influence on the game			1
@entity2 have the forward muscle and the set - piece to strangle a suspect @entity30 pack on saturday @entity165 and @entity186 have to take responsibility for setting up dynamic , fast carries , encouraging off - loads and establishing real momentum up front			1
where @entity165 stands apart from the other @entity2 10s is his quick feet and ability to operate in the traffic close to the gain line			1
he has a superb eye for the break and a beautiful passing game			0
look for him to attack the gain line only to drop the ball off to a charging @entity201 or , better still , flick the ball behind his centres to his back three running at pace — all within touching distance of @entity206 and @entity207			0
when he finds himself on the move in the outer channels he makes the right decision more often than not			0
he can get @entity31 rocking			0
there ’s no doubt @entity172 has been way below his usual high standards this autumn but he ’s a world - class performer and i ’m sure , given the chance to get some match fitness away from the glare of international rugby , he ’ll rediscover his form			1
so @entity165 needs to deliver			0
it ’s also a big game for @entity186			1
the @entity224 scrum - half has not quite delivered on the early promise of his career but he still has time on his side and there ’s no doubt he ’s a terrific talent			1
i saw @entity71 ’s comments this week about his @entity73 team - mate @entity72 being made a scapegoat for @entity2 ’s stuttering displays and , to a certain extent , i agree			2
sir @entity237 feels @entity238 ( right ) may not have the skillset to operate at outside centre for @entity2 care ’s game is based on tempo and quick ball , so replacing him with @entity186 is an admission that they ’re not looking to play the all - court attacking game that made them so dangerous in last season ’s @entity251			1
@entity186 brings different qualities and it ’s essential his box kicking and breakdown marshalling are on the money			2
i ’d have liked to have seen @entity2 persist with @entity172 at 12 because i think that combination with @entity165 could still work			1
but by bringing in @entity201 at inside centre , @entity16 and his coaches have stuck to the principle of selecting two playmakers in their inside back division			0
@entity266 's @entity265 no longer features for the @entity30 but he remains one of the best in the business his kicking game will compliment @entity165 ’s but together they must be inch perfect because , in @entity98 , @entity30 have a full back capable of doing serious damage from broken field			1
he is a superb athlete and @entity2 just can not afford to give him space by kicking too deep or failing to chase effectively			2
it ’s an area of @entity2 ’s game that has been surprisingly poor so far this autumn and it ’s critical they get that right			1
i do n’t believe @entity238 — for all his many qualities — is the right man to play outside them at 13 but at least with @entity165 and @entity201 on the pitch @entity2 have two players who can put width on the ball and create chances			2
i ’ve no doubt @entity2 ’s forwards will provide plenty of ball			2
will their backs have the wit to finish those chances ? their opponents are the masters of threequarter play			0
in many ways it ’s a shame @entity265 wo n’t be here to light up @entity31 because i still believe the @entity266 fly - half is the best threequarter in world rugby			2
but with @entity206 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity98 , @entity207 and @entity303 on the team sheet we should be as concerned as we are excited to see @entity30 in action			2
i ’ve been really impressed with @entity207 so far on this tour , while @entity206 and @entity303 are an intelligent half - back pairing			0
@entity165 and @entity201 have been picked primarily for their attacking potential but with @entity207 and @entity206 opposite , both men will have to be on their mettle defensively			0
@entity201 was exposed badly in that department last year when @entity207 barrelled straight over him for @entity30 ’s try and he has yet to convince me that physically he is robust enough in that position			2
@entity2 captain @entity314 ( left ) will face the might of @entity30 openside @entity316 on saturday @entity58 , who coped admirably with everything @entity130 threw at him last week , can also expect to be targeted			1
i ’m a huge fan of @entity319 as a coach and @entity30 will be inventive and hard to defend against			1
flanker @entity316 is also a wonderful player who impresses me at every juncture			2
his clash with @entity314 will be great viewing			1
both sides have lost their two important games this autumn and will be desperate for a win			0
for @entity2 , their next game is on a friday night against @entity328 in @entity329 in february			1
get it wrong again today and it ’s going to be a miserable @entity332 for @entity38 and his team			0
what a great test match we have in store			0
the time is now , @entity2 .			2

@entity2 face the @entity30 in their final autumn test on saturday
@entity58 needs to boss the game and control the tempo
@entity172 has been below par but he is world class , and will recover
this is a huge game for @entity2 scrum half @entity186
@entity314 's clash with @entity316 will be *fascinating*
