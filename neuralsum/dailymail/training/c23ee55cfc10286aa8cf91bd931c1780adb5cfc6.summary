by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 28 july 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 28 july 2013 loyal : @entity2 was assistant to @entity3 for 35 years and was with him at his death @entity3 's long - serving personal assistant has told how he died peacefully in her arms			1
@entity2 , 59 , said the film director and food critic had died quietly after she told him his friends ' in heaven are waiting for you '			1
the former model and miss @entity13 was mr @entity3 's personal assistant for 35 years			1
her notoriously outrageous and straight - talking boss would famously shout ' @entity16 ! ' whenever he needed anything			1
miss may 's loyalty to her boss meant she nursed him through his deteriorating health and became his carer in his final months			2
she said she had gone to change his dressings as he lay on a coma on the day he died in january when she spoke to him			1
' i was just holding his hand and i was saying , " what are you holding on for ? you said goodbye to everybody , everyone in heaven is waiting for you " and suddenly his breath started to change and he took his last breath and that was it , ' she told the @entity32			1
she added it was ' heartbreaking ' to watch him die			2
' he had gone through hell and to see it any longer ... no , he had to go			2
i felt so sorry for him , it was tragic , ' she said			2
mr @entity3 left her £ 300,000 and the £ 1.2 million @entity49 flat he owned in which she lived rent - free			1
but it was revealed last week he owed £ 12million in debts which has dramatically shrunk his estate to £ 4.75million			2
as a result , miss may has received a tax bill for £ 150,000 and has been told there is a £ 600,000 loan on the flat which she will also have to pay			2
she said : ‘ @entity3 was great fun but oh , what a complete mess			1
he always promised me a pension			2
if he saw me crying because i was worried about the future , he told me not to worry because i was well taken care of in his will			0
' and of course i believed him			0
towards the end he kept writing and rewriting his will			0
we used to joke it was like the hokey - cokey			0
one day someone was in , the next day they were out			0
i suppose that was because he knew the money was running out			0
‘ @entity3 made it clear that his bequests to me should be clear of inheritance tax and gift tax and that if there was any , his estate should pay it			1
he wrote that down , had it documented and gave me a copy			0
' it was all done legally			0
it ’s with my lawyer who has been contesting everything with the executors and @entity3 ’s lawyers			1
if i had to meet these bills , i would have to sell the flat – and then where would i live ? ' miss may is hoping the book she is writing about mr @entity3 's life - which he gave her his blessing to do - will pay the bills			1
you know everything that was never published			0
your book will be your real pension			0
do n’t be afraid to get it all down			0
” ‘ i ’ve written 40,000 words so far and have been offered a publisher			0
i ’ve even been contacted by a tv company who want to make a documentary about it all			0
i think it makes pretty racy reading			0
there was a lot @entity3 did n’t tell the world , did n’t want people to know until he was gone			1
i think the public will enjoy it			0
’ miss may knew mr winner better than anyone and her role as his assistant went as far as washing his hair in beer , sewing buttons on his shirt and plucking his nasal and ear hair			1
miss may was married for many years but is now divorced .			1
