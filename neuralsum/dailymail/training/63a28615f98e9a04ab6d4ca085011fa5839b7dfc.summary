by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 13:28 est , 9 november 2012 law change : adults would only be able to view porn if they specifically ' opt in '			1
( posed by model ) the fight for an automatic block on online porn will begin in earnest today , with a bid to bring in new laws			0
a senior peer will launch a bid to change the law obliging @entity16 ’s internet giants to impose a filter to block access to all pornographic images			1
the private member ’s bill from @entity22 - the wife of former @entity24 chancellor @entity23 - would bring in a system whereby adults will only be able to see porn if they specifically ‘ opt in ’ after a strict age verification check			1
but the legislation faces opposition from @entity32 peers , who claim that an opt - in system is not the best way to protect children online			2
@entity36 , an independent @entity38 peer who chaired juvenile courts earlier in her career , said action was needed because of the ‘ dangerous ’ effect that sexual content was having on relationships between boys and girls			1
she warned that access to porn was giving children the wrong idea about relationships and could lead to teenage boys treating girls as sex objects			2
@entity22 told the @entity56 that @entity57 should take action because porn was such a ‘ lucrative ’ source of revenue for them			1
‘ the duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s , ’ she said			0
she added : ‘ the amount of pornographic material which is now available through all these new methods on the internet is really quite dangerous for young people			1
‘ a lot of children now are far more savvy about the internet than their parents , so they are much more likely to come across this sort of material by mistake			2
‘ an opt - in system would rule out any concern people have about their children getting access to adult material by mistake			1
’ ' dangerous ' : @entity22 said easy access to porn was affecting young people 's relationships			1
( posed by model ) her ‘ @entity98 ’ , received its first reading earlier this year but its second reading today is the first chance for debate			0
the legislation only has a chance of becoming law if it receives the support of ministers			0
only when the government grants enough @entity107 time to debate a private members ’ bill does it have any hope of passing into law			0
@entity32 sources last night insisted they were keen to protect children online , but were still considering the results of a @entity105 consultation on whether an opt - in system was the best way forward			2
the @entity56 is campaigning for an ‘ opt in ’ system which would protect children from adult material on the web by restricting it to those over the age of 18 who specifically ask to see it			1
but ministers and the internet giants would prefer a less stringent ‘ opt out ’ scheme under which parents are offered the option of imposing a filter			1
in july , a huge petition calling for an opt - in system - containing 115,000 names - was handed in to @entity134			0
and a government consultation on the issue attracted 3,500 responses by the time it finished in september			0
but despite the high response , ministers have not yet responded to the consultation or even revealed what the majority view was			0
some campaigners claim the government is dragging its feet on the issue			0
@entity22 said her bill was an attempt to force ministers to act			0
the explanatory notes of the bill state that its objective is to ‘ reduce the ability of children and young people to access inappropriate material online ’			1
under her plans : @entity36 said easy access to porn was affecting young people 's relationships			1
‘ i am concerned about proper loving relationships between boys and girls , and that they have proper respect for one another , ’ she said			0
‘ i am concerned about the harm that this sort of stuff can do			0
’ @entity22 said she hoped @entity57 would take action voluntarily - but the bill would force them to impose filters if they do not ‘ stir themselves to action ’			1
‘ [ online porn ] is quite a lucrative source of income for @entity57 , who want to allow people to do what they like over the age of 18 , ’ she said			1
‘ if you ’re over 18 then of course is your own business , but there are real concerns about the under 18s			0
‘ the duty is on those who make extra profit from this sort of material to do all they can to protect under 18s , ' she added			0
from knives to films to gambling , there is an age verification process ... so why ca n't there be one for the internet ? by @entity205 the internet has opened up a communication and information highway making skyping our children at university , booking a holiday and finding homework answers all possible within a few keystrokes			0
however , with its ascendancy there has also been the more disturbing element of unfettered access to explicit material for internet users			0
young people and children can unwittingly stumble across pornographic material from an innocent @entity225 search or be presented with multiple videos about how - to self - harm whilst viewing @entity229 videos			1
with only 39 per cent of parents of children aged 5 - 15 using internet controls or filtering software we can be sure this is a widespread problem			2
accessing the internet from the privacy of your own room as an under - 18 - year - old can cause unwarranted problems from harmful exposure to age - inappropriate material to cyber-bullying			2
when 66 per cent of young people aged 7 - 16 say that they use their laptops or other portable devices tucked away in their bedroom , the low take - up of filtering software is a significant cause for concern			1
current legislation on online child safety is clearly deeply unsatisfactory			0
children and young people are frequently viewing material which is not appropriate for them			2
there are no effective legal safeguards in place to protect them			0
in 2010 , 11 per cent of @entity16 children aged 9 - 16 had encountered sexual images online in the previous year			2
this heightened exposure has been found to impact conceptions of sexual norms , body image and behaviour within relationships amongst young people			1
the government recently consulted with the public on three models of internet safety , one of which mirrored the system i propose in my online safety @entity278 – the opt - in model			1
the opt - in model would block pornographic adult content unless the user can demonstrate that they are 18 or over and they opt - in to access the content			1
it would also require device manufacturers to provide means of filtering other content ( e.g. violence or gambling ) at the time of purchase			1
by supporting my @entity278 , the government could make it law for the industry , including internet service providers , mobile phone operators and device manufacturers , to help parents protect under - 18s from exposure to harmful material			1
i was extremely concerned that the government ’s consultation did not even mention age verification			0
every school in the country operates a default filter on age - inappropriate content for its pupils so we are in no doubt that the technology is available			2
there would be no technical obstacles to performing age verification online at 18			0
mobile phone companies have been operating age verification since 2004 and we see many products and services from knives to films or even gambling restricted by age in our supermarkets , cinemas and on our high streets			2
online gambling has been restricted by a system of age verification since the @entity334 and this has proved to be a successful method to protect children and young people who are vulnerable to the risks that come with access to gambling			1
my online safety @entity278 therefore seeks to migrate to the online world practices which are commonplace , well understood and accepted in the real world , and have been for years			2
the industry has shown itself not willing to take all the necessary steps to provide protection for vulnerable minors off its own back			0
now we need to get tough and force all those who provide internet services to act decisively on this issue			2
the law must be changed			0
we have a responsibility to future generations to do this today .			0

proposed law change would oblige @entity16 's internet giants to impose a filter blocking access to porn
@entity22 wants to see a system whereby adults will only be able to see porn if they specifically ' opt in '
@entity367 warns sexual content is having a ' dangerous ' effect on young people 's relationships
isps and mobile phone operators would be forced to provide an internet service without access to pornography .
adult *subscribers* would be able to opt in to receive adult content . they would have their age verified by the service provider .
in *addition* , the manufacturers of *computers* and *smart* phones would also have to provide software at the time of purchase to enable people to filter internet content .
the idea behind this *addition*al filtering level is so that parents can choose to *exclude* material they deem inappropriate for their child at different ages .
mobile phone operators and @entity57 would also have to provide *prominent* , easily accessible and clear information about online safety at the time of purchase - and to make such information available for the *duration* of the service .
