@entity2 , 28 , daughter of @entity4 's older brother @entity3 , has been a frequent critic of the @entity5 since publicly breaking with it in 2005			1
in ' @entity15 : my @entity19 inside @entity9 and my @entity21 ' , she will reveal ' strange and disturbing ' details about growing up in the church and will provide a firsthand account of @entity9 's ' upper ranks ' , its publishers @entity18 say			1
in 2000 , when she was 16 years old , ms @entity27 's parents left @entity9 , disillusioned with its practices			1
in the five years that followed , she has claimed that - because of the church 's policy of ' disconnection ' with relatives and friends who do not support the cult - all letters between them were intercepted and she was not allowed to answer the telephone for over a year			1
' if you flunked your uniform inspection , sometimes if you were late			0
you would be dumped with a five - gallon bucket of ice water , ' she told investigative journalist @entity44 in 2008			0
' we were also required to write down all transgressions			0
similar to a sin in the catholic religion			0
' after writing them all down , we would receive a meter check on the @entity51 to make sure we were n't hiding anything , and you would have to keep writing until you came up clean			0
this is from the age of 5 until i was 12			0
' after leaving the church , ms @entity2 , with @entity58 and @entity59 - both also raised in @entity9 - founded the website exscientologykids.com			1
tell all memoir : ' @entity15 , left , will reveal ' strange and disturbing ' details about growing up in the church			1
ms @entity2 , right has set up a support group to help other @entity66 , current and former the site was launched as support group offering ' non-judgmental support for those who are still in @entity9 , discussion and debate for those who 've already left , and a plethora of easy - to - understand references for the curious '			1
following the public split between the cult 's most famous member , @entity79 , and wife @entity80 , ms @entity2 spoke out in support of @entity80 and the couple 's daughter @entity82			1
' my experience in growing up in @entity9 is that it is both mentally and at times physically abusive , ' she said in a statement released through the @entity59 website			1
' i was allowed to see my parents only once a week at best – sometimes not for years			0
powerful people : ms @entity2 's uncle and @entity9 leader @entity8 , left , talks at the opening of a new church in @entity95 , while its most famous member , actor @entity79 , right , speaks at a launch in @entity98 @entity9 couple : @entity100 and his wife @entity101 at the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) @entity103 at @entity104 in @entity105 in 2005 ' we got a lousy education from unqualified teachers , forced labor , long hours , forced confessions , being held in rooms not to mention the mental anguish of trying to figure out all of the conflicting information they force upon you as a young child			1
' while it is very unlikely that @entity82 would have the same upbringing as me ( due to her parent 's celebrity status ) , any organization that is capable of mistreating and neglecting the needs of children , regardless of their social status , and which has a long history of breaking up families is no place for an innocent child			0
happier times : following the public split between the organization 's most famous member , @entity79 , and wife @entity80 , ms @entity2 spoke out in support of @entity80 and the couple 's daughter @entity82 ( pictured in 2007 ) ' the people in @entity9 who are responsible for " pr " are experts at twisting the truth and intimidation tactics			1
' as a mother myself , i offer my support to @entity80 and wish for her all of the strength she will need to do what is best for her and her daughter			1
' she says , since leaving the church , she has been branded a ' suppressive person ' , which the church ’s website defines as someone ' who seeks to suppress other people in their vicinity '			0
the @entity9 website reads : ' a suppressive person will goof up or vilify any effort to help anybody and particularly knife with violence anything calculated to make human beings more powerful or more intelligent			2
' the " suppressive person " is also known as the " anti-social personality "			0
within this category you would find ‘ @entity168 , @entity169 , the unrepentant killer and the drug lord , ' according to the website			0
' beyond belief : my @entity19 inside @entity9 and my @entity21 ' will be published by @entity175 imprint @entity18 , due out in january			2
scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created			0
the belief was founded in 1952 by @entity3 who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels			2
followers believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were brought to @entity185 on a space ship that looks like a @entity188 plane			0
through a process called @entity191 they make themselves far better people , and even massively boost their iq			0
such claims however have never been proved and instead @entity9 has faced allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its followers			2
among the most controversial aspects are ' audits ' in which followers have to explain their inner secrets to a superior , including their sex lives			0
there have also been reports of bizarre punishments and questions have been raised over what happened to the wife of its current leader @entity8 , who has reportedly not been seen since 2007			1
those who join the higher order of @entity9 , known as @entity216 , pledge their allegiance for one billion years - a vow supposedly made by children as young as 10			2
@entity9 courts @entity221 stars and famous followers include @entity79 and @entity100 but it is very rare that they speak about their beliefs			2
@entity79 's marriage to @entity80 was said to have ended over her refusal to allow their six - year - old daughter @entity82 to be indoctrinated			2
she was also said to be concerned about the child being sent to the @entity230 in @entity231 where members are banned from having children , are paid just $ 50 a week and can be punished for simply looking at somebody the wrong way			0
@entity9 was also the basis of the current cinema hit the master in which a drifter is taken in by the leader of a cult - like group .			1
