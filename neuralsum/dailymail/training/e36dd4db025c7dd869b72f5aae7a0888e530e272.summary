by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 4 april 2013 for girls , proms are all about the dresses			1
@entity4 just never imagined what it would take to pick one			0
first , there was what felt like a million questions			0
' what kind of dress was i looking for ? what size am i ? what kind of color ? long or short ? ' said the 15 - year - old freshman at @entity18 , a state - run boarding school in @entity19 , @entity20			1
her answers gave her passage into a room stocked full of dresses â€“ a bounty that @entity4 , or most students , in rural @entity20 have never seen			1
' all of these people are here helping them ( the students ) out and doing all this stuff , and suddenly they realize they 're a lot more important than they ever thought they were , ' said @entity55 , project director for the school 's dorms			1
' that 's the big thing			0
' in its fifth year of helping students at the school , the program arranges for donations of the dresses , discounted tuxes , and hair and makeup artists			1
@entity43 , which sits in the shadow of a dormant volcano , is the only state - run boarding school in @entity20			1
it has nearly 400 students , and about 80 percent this year are @entity73			0
many , like @entity4 , hail from small communities well off the state 's limited road system			1
many schools in these rural villages do n't have proms , and ones that do are n't at @entity43 's level			1
ready to party : students from @entity18 dance in their new formal dresses at prom program founder @entity86 said she and other volunteers , mainly her co-workers at the @entity41 - based @entity89 , are proud of the teenagers for leaving their families and villages to get a better education , and this is a way to show their admiration			1
' they do n't have the family support to help them do this			1
so we 're kind of like fairy godmothers here to help them make sure they can look as good as they want to go to their prom , ' she said			2
' i know lots of people buy expensive dresses and only wear them once			2
so i figured this would be a good opportunity to ask for donations ' @entity86 got the idea for the program when she lived in @entity19 and helped a niece , who was attending the school , get ready for the prom			1
that 's when she realized other girls were n't going to the dance because they did n't have a dress			1
@entity86 moved to @entity41 after she got a job as an account specialist with the airline , which had just celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2007			0
she decided to see if anyone would be willing to donate her party dress from the anniversary ball for the girls at @entity43			2
' i know lots of people buy expensive dresses and only wear them once , ' she said			2
' so i figured this would be a good opportunity to ask for donations			0
' finishing touches : one student gets some elaborate nail art to complete her prom night look the perfect fit : volunteers @entity142 ( left ) and @entity143 do last minute alterations hours before the prom , so each girl 's dress looks like it was made for her that first year , 30 dresses were donated			2
that number has increased to about 130 this year , and the girls get to keep the frocks they pick			2
the main booster for the program , @entity86 solicits donations while talking to people on airplanes , in airports , at work			2
the program has a signature identifier : during the prom , all the volunteers wear tiaras , but @entity86 sports one throughout the year to attract attention to her program			1
inspired idea : @entity86 , seen having her make - up applied , is the brains behind the @entity34 program the number of volunteers also has grown , from @entity86 and five others the first year to about 40 this year			1
the volunteers are @entity89 or @entity175 employees , and their family and friends from across the @entity178			2
the volunteers include professional hairdressers , nail artists , even a master tailor			0
last saturday , they gave the girls up - dos , fancy nails , took prom photos and made flower decorations			1
like many students , sophomore @entity187 was appreciative for the help			0
she spent the day primping for the all - school prom , but also found time to make her boyfriend a boutonniere			1
@entity187 said it was especially nice since the boarding students ' have no parents or moms ' there to help them			2
for many , saturday 's prom was the first time they have dressed formally for a dance , had clothes altered , had their nails and hair done , got tanning , even wore jewelry			0
' it 's something that many of them have seen on tv , ' @entity55 said			0
' they know other people do it , and now they 're doing it			0
' @entity216 , a @entity217 , @entity218			0
- based flight attendant who was in @entity19 for the second year , said the freshman girls ' touched my heart			1
' ' i have a daughter that is 17			0
i think , " oh , it would be hard for her to be away from home			0
" so i think they kind of get the nurturing from us , ' said @entity216 , who described her duty as ' glam fairy , ' spraying girls with glitter			0
and for the record , @entity4 picked a dress that was black on the top with white frilly ruffles on the bottom			0
she planned to wear it when she and friends went to a pizzeria before the dance			0
' i 'm just going to be extra careful ' not to drop any food on it , she laughed .			0

girls at @entity18 , a state - run boarding school in @entity19 , @entity20 , do n't have family support to help them buy an outfit and get ready . the prom *princess* program aims to play that role
