forget the must - have wine cellar , hot - tub or £ 1,700 @entity2 coffee - maker — the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas			1
many of the super-rich are having them built — complete with huge comfy seats and cup - holders , eardrum - blasting surround - sound systems , massive screens and even cocktail bars and popcorn - makers			2
celebrities with a home cinema include the @entity16 actor @entity15 , retail tycoon sir @entity17 and @entity19 owner @entity18			1
and this week we learnt that the @entity21 want one , too			2
forget the must - have wine cellar , hot - tub or £ 1,700 @entity2 coffee - maker — the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas a planning application submitted for their 1860s home in @entity28 ’s @entity27 shows drawings for a lower - groundfloor ‘ cinema room ’			1
and the word ‘ cinema ’ — suggestive of a large scale — is entirely appropriate			0
the ceiling height would be 9.5ft , and the room measures some 300 sq ft — just over twice the size of the average @entity39 living room			0
that means the @entity21 could easily fit 20 seats — enough for their family of six plus friends — in the room which would adjoin a 500 sq ft playroom			0
in this ‘ @entity47 ’ , a projector and pull - down screen would be built into the ‘ non-historic ’ ceiling			0
having hired the ultra-swish interiors guru @entity50 , one can safely assume it will be much classier than your local multiplex			0
meanwhile , @entity54 , who has recently purchased a £ 10million manor house with his barrister wife @entity56 on an island in the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , is also building a home cinema			1
it will be in a new complex , set apart from the house , that includes a pool , a ‘ professional kitchen ’ , a pergola and a bar			0
draft layouts lodged with the local planning office reveal that the cinema will have 12 seats , behind which there will be an audio / video room which will house the banks of electronics required			0
@entity54 , who has recently purchased a £ 10million manor house with his barrister wife @entity56 ( right ) on an island in the @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , is also building a home cinema and it is unlikely that @entity83 celebrities such as @entity54 are waiting for films to come out on dvd — no doubt eager publicists and production companies send @entity89 movies even before they are issued on general release			1
not far from the @entity21 in @entity28 , pop star @entity91 lives in a 46 - room house that was previously owned by the late film director @entity93			0
a planning application submitted for @entity21 's ( above ) home earlier this week showed plans for a ' cinema room ' @entity91 has sought planning permission to build an underground complex that features a pool and home cinema ( although @entity102 had already installed an impressive cinema with photos of his own movies on the walls )			1
however , as well as these celebrities , @entity111 oligarchs and retail tycoons , there is an increasing trend for normal families to install home cinemas			1
@entity116 , owner of @entity117 , an audiovisual and internet installation firm , says : ‘ like swimming pools , home cinemas set the status of the house			1
‘ many clients want the whole cinema experience , complete with banks of theatre - style seating			0
’ she says that one client had his own study - sized cinema built in his ‘ man cave ’ — complete with a solo cinema seat that was a present from his wife			0
so , how much does a home cinema cost ? ‘ i ’ve installed all the technology — projector , screen , amplifier , speakers and control unit — for less than £ 10,000 , ’ says mrs @entity116			1
‘ but the real expense is on the rest of the room — the seating , decoration and lighting which automatically dims when the movie starts , giving that complete cinema feel			0
’ but with the average cost of a family visit to the cinema costing £ 100 ( including tickets , transport and food ) , it almost starts to look like good value			1
no matter your budget , it is possible to get something approaching the multi-millionaire home cinema experience			1
if you have a spare room that you can dedicate , then so much the better — but you do n’t have to be a @entity83 star to watch in film ‑ star style			0
while the home cinemas found in celebrity homes might have popcorn makers , it is easy to make some yourself here are the best ways to get your home cinema up and running ... under £ 1,000 at this level , buying a projector is out of your league			1
your best bet is to shop around for a discounted 55in tv , such as the @entity178 — £ 799 from @entity179			1
to improve the sound quality , invest in a soundbar — a slimline unit that houses lots of small speakers — such as the @entity185 , available from @entity186 for £ 149 ( richersounds.com )			1
this leaves you with £ 52 to spare , which you may consider spending on six old cinema chairs currently available on @entity191 for £ 48			1
with the remaining £ 4 , you can buy four boxes of @entity193 salted microwave popcorn , available from @entity195 for £ 1 per box			1
installation can be done yourself			0
sherlock actor @entity15 ( above ) also has a home cinema under £ 5,000 although you can buy a decent projector for under this price , that will leave you with very little for speakers , seating and all those other extras			1
it makes more sense to buy a 75in tv , such as the @entity208 — £ 2,498.97 , also from @entity179			2
this could then be combined with a soundbar , a subwoofer speaker that delivers thudding bass and two wireless surround - sound speakers			0
the best package for all this is the @entity216 + sub + 2 x play : 1 , which costs £ 1,534 ( smarthomesounds.co.uk )			1
with nearly £ 1,000 left over , you can buy four @entity219 leather cinema chairs from @entity220 at £ 219 each , and have enough to buy almost £ 100 worth of snacks			2
if you are handy with a power drill and have enough muscle around to lift up the tv set , installation can be @entity226			0
over £ 5,000 if you have a big budget , consider buying a projector			2
you can plug any media device into it , including a set - top box such as an @entity232 , or a blu - ray or dvd player , or stream the internet			0
the @entity236 costs £ 2,799 and is almost as good as what you ’ll get at the cinema			1
do n’t skimp on the screen or just project on to a white wall			0
to get the best picture , look at the @entity242 , 197in x 147in , which is £ 1,078 on @entity220			2
you will then need an amplifier , and at this level you should invest in anything that features @entity248 ’s stunning new @entity247 technology for the most advanced surround - sound			2
try the @entity250 at around £ 1,329			2
buy a range of at least 11 speakers , including wall and ceiling units , as well as multiple subwoofers			0
aim to spend £ 250 per speaker at the very least			2
finally , invest in some @entity258 chairs from @entity259 on @entity191 at £ 1,299 each			2
these feature incliners , footrests and backrests , storage boxes , cup - coolers and even cup - warmers			0
installation will have to be done by a professional , as projectors and screens need careful mounting .			0

sir @entity17 and @entity15 also enjoy home cinemas
costs less than £ 10,000 to install the technology , according to experts
