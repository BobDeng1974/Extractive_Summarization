it is one of the most unlikely links on @entity3			0
a new @entity5 satellite has revealed the stunning link between the @entity8 desert and the @entity10 rainforest			1
for the first time it showed vast dust clouds travelling high in the atmosphere			1
the data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the @entity8 at @entity28			1
this volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust			1
the dust then travels 1,600 miles across the @entity34 , though some drops to the surface or is flushed from the sky by rain			1
near the eastern coast of @entity41 , at @entity39 , 132 million tons remain in the air , and 27.7 million tons – enough to fill 104,908 semi trucks – fall to the surface over the @entity45			1
about 43 million tons of dust travel farther to settle out over the @entity47 , past @entity48			1
scientists have not only measured the volume of dust , they have also calculated how much phosphorus – remnant in @entity8 sands from part of the desert 's past as a lake bed – gets carried across the ocean from one of the planet 's most desolate places to one of its most fertile			1
' this is a small world , ' said said lead author @entity66 , an atmospheric scientist at the @entity67 who works at @entity5 's @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70			1
' and we 're all connected together			0
' a new paper published feb. 24 in @entity73 , a journal of the @entity75 , provides the first satellite - based estimate of this phosphorus transport over multiple years			2
a second paper published online by @entity66 and colleagues jan. 8 in @entity81 of the @entity82 provided the first multi-year satellite estimate of overall dust transport from the @entity8 to the @entity10			1
it is the first time a @entity5 satellite has quantified in three dimensions how much dust makes this trans - @entity34 journey			1
this trans - continental journey of dust is important because of what is in the dust , @entity66 said			2
specifically the dust picked up from the @entity95 in @entity96 , an ancient lake bed where rock minerals composed of dead microorganisms are loaded with phosphorus			2
@entity100 is an essential nutrient for plant proteins and growth , which the @entity10 rain forest depends on in order to flourish			0
nutrients – the same ones found in commercial fertilizers – are in short supply in @entity112 soils			2
instead they are locked up in the plants themselves			0
@entity118 , decomposing leaves and organic matter provide the majority of nutrients , which are rapidly absorbed by plants and trees after entering the soil			2
the data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the @entity8 at @entity28			1
but some nutrients , including phosphorus , are washed away by rainfall into streams and rivers , draining from the @entity45 like a slowly leaking bathtub			2
the phosphorus that reaches @entity10 soils from @entity8 dust , an estimated 22,000 tons per year , is about the same amount as that lost from rain and flooding , @entity66 said			1
the finding is part of a bigger research effort to understand the role of dust and aerosols in the environment and on local and global climate			2
' we know that dust is very important in many ways			2
it is an essential component of the @entity3 system			0
' @entity156 will affect climate and , at the same time , climate change will affect dust , ' said @entity66			2
this volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust			0
the new dust transport estimates were derived from data collected by a lidar instrument on @entity5 's @entity167 and @entity168 , or @entity16 , satellite from 2007 though 2013			1
@entity66 and colleagues focused on the saharan dust transport across the @entity34 to @entity41 and then beyond to the @entity47 because it is the largest transport of dust on the planet			0
dust collected from the @entity95 and from ground stations on @entity177 and in @entity178 give scientists an estimate of the proportion of phosphorus in @entity8 dust			0
@entity16 collects ' curtains ' of data that show valuable information about the altitude of dust layers in the atmosphere			0
@entity16 sends out 20 laser pulses every second , and each is only 20 billionths of a second long			0
knowing the height at which dust travels is important for understanding , and eventually using computers to model , where that dust will go and how the dust will interact with @entity3 's heat balance and clouds , now and in future climate scenarios			1
this estimate is used to calculate how much phosphorus gets deposited in the @entity45 from this dust transport			0
looking at the data year by year shows that that pattern is actually highly variable			0
there was an 86 percent change between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011 , @entity66 said			0
' wind currents are different at different altitudes , ' said @entity214			0
' this is a step forward in providing the understanding of what dust transport looks like in three dimensions , and then comparing with these models that are being used for climate studies			0
' climate studies range in scope from global to regional changes , such as those that may occur in the @entity10 in coming years			0
in addition to dust , the @entity10 is home to many other types of aerosols like smoke from fires and biological particles , such as bacteria , fungi , pollen , and spores released by the plants themselves			0
in the future , @entity66 and his colleagues plan to explore the effects of those aerosols on local clouds – and how they are influenced by dust from @entity247 .			1

@entity5 satellite took *3d* readings of dust clouds travelling
cloud rises in the air and ties together the desert and the *jungle*
wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year
dust is rich in nutrients which help fertilise the forests
