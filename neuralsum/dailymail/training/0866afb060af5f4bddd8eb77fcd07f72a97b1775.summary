there are certain tools a teacher can employ when dealing with unruly pupils , whether it ’s a stern look or slightly raised voice or perhaps the threat of a detention			2
but for the head of educating the @entity11 ’s @entity10 , the greatest tactic is wearing sky - high stilettos , so she can tower over the teenagers in her school			1
@entity17 , 41 , has admitted she stores several pairs of high heels under her desk in a specially designated ‘ shoe cupboard ’			1
and she said the added height helps her command respect from insolent teens , despite not having the ‘ natural authority ’ of a male head			1
ms @entity17 ’s school is the subject of educating the @entity11 , which is @entity42 ’s latest fly - on - the - wall documentary series			1
it follows educating @entity46 in 2011 and educating @entity47 in 2013 , both of which threw a spotlight on the challenges faced by teachers , the unruly behaviour of their pupils as well as stories involving personal hardships			2
ms @entity17 says the added height helps her command respect from insolent teens , despite not having the ‘ natural authority ’ of a male head ( pictured is a scene from the programme ) the show follows educating @entity46 in 2011 and @entity60 in 2013 , both of which threw a spotlight on the challenges faced by teachers , the unruly behaviour of their pupils as well as stories involving personal hardships ms @entity17 , pictured left with deputy head @entity67 , said she thought it was important for students to see women in top positions educating the @entity11 follows the same format but this time the focus is on @entity74 in @entity75 , east @entity76			1
speaking ahead of episode one tonight , ms @entity17 said : ‘ i do think there are challenges to being female			2
' it ’s a different set of challenges , not least the fact that most of the population of the school are considerably taller than me which is why i have to wear such ridiculous heels all day			2
‘ i think there are times when people do n’t see that i have the natural authority because of my gender			0
therefore it takes longer for me to assert that authority , partly because people are n’t used to female leaders , because there are n’t enough of us			0
’ in both the previous series the head teachers have been men			0
but ms @entity17 said she thought it was important for students to see women in top positions			2
@entity74 is the subject of educating the @entity11 , which is @entity42 ’s latest fly - on - the - wall documentary series the opening episode features scenes of despairing teachers , teenagers answering back , and even a student calling her tutor a ‘ d * * * * * * * ’			1
ms @entity17 is pictured sitting behind her desk at the school she said : ‘ i think it ’s a tremendous asset having a strong female team in a school			2
it ’s brilliant for our kids to have strong female role models			0
' it ’s important for both the girls and the boys in this school to see women taking on jobs that are n’t usual , or that they have n’t experienced before			0
that was one of the reasons i was very , very keen on doing the programme			0
’ when educating the @entity11 begins tonight , it will perhaps be clear why ms @entity17 and her staff might at times feel a lack of respect from the children in their care			1
the opening episode features scenes of despairing teachers , teenagers answering back , and even a student calling her tutor a ‘ d * * * * * * * ’			0
