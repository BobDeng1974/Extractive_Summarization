' the @entity14 , if they choose to nominate him , that 's their prerogative			2

' but her spokesman @entity31 said today in a bizarre statement that the ‘ something ’ she knows is simply that he will not become president			2
‘ leader @entity0 previously made a reference to the extensive amount of information that is in the public record , ’ mr @entity31 said			1
