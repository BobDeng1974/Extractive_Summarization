@entity1 's memories of @entity3 ’s last encounter with @entity4 can give him sleepless nights as he recalls the 21 - 15 defeat that would cost @entity7 his job			1
that cold day at @entity9 two years ago was the low point in the 90 - cap career of the @entity3 utility back			1
so , on saturday at @entity13 , when he and his team - mates face - up to @entity4 once again , @entity1 is determined to bury some demons			1
that sense of guilt remains , the depth of despair still felt			0
all @entity3 could muster that day were five @entity22 penalties while @entity4 scored two tries on their way to a famous victory			1
@entity1 ( centre ) stands dejected after @entity3 ’s 21 - 15 defeat to @entity4 at @entity9 in 2012 for half an hour after the final whistle @entity7 walked up and down the @entity9 touchline deep in private conversion with @entity32 chief executive @entity31			1
later that evening he had resigned after accepting responsibility for the defeat , which had followed hammerings by @entity36 and @entity37			0
‘ that @entity4 match two years holds bad memories for me , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i have had some bad losses but that was the most horrendous			0
‘ not just because we did n’t want to give @entity4 their first win over @entity3 but because it cost a man his job — a man i got on well with and liked			1
@entity1 ( right ) puts in a fend on @entity48 but the @entity4 would go on to claim victory in @entity50 ‘ the buck stops somewhere , but it was the players on the day who did n’t turn up and that cost us the game			1
‘ what made that loss even worse was that we thought our mindset was right and we would beat them			0
‘ at the end of the game all the players went back to our clubs and that was it			0
we got the chance to rebuild at the @entity67 but our coach was gone			0
’ there is no danger that @entity3 head coach @entity71 will suffer a similar fate if @entity3 lose to @entity4			1
he has won four out of six games in charge and his team go into the match off the back of a fine win over @entity80 and a fighting loss to world champions @entity36			1
but @entity1 , who looks set to partner his @entity84 team - mate @entity83 in the centre after @entity86 was ruled out with a hamstring injury , believes those two performances will count for little if @entity4 are not beaten			1
@entity1 gets physical with @entity36 flanker @entity89 during @entity3 's narrow loss last saturday ‘ there have been times in the past when we have had a couple of good showings then have dropped off and that is not what we want to do this time , ’ said the 33 - year - old			1
‘ it is very important we do n’t take a backwards step in terms of performance against @entity4 after beating @entity80 and then pushing the @entity36 close			2
for the good of @entity105 rugby , we need to keep kicking on			0
‘ as a squad , the display against @entity36 especially helped our self - belief , which had always been a big issue in the past			0
‘ from playing around the world , i know @entity105 players are harder on themselves than any other nation but we are getting better at accepting that errors happen and you have to dust yourself down and get on with it			0
@entity1 puts in a great tackle on @entity36 winger @entity119 at @entity120 last weekend ‘ we are at a point where we can realise our potential as we have a good , exciting side but we have to back up our performances — otherwise it is just talk again			1
‘ i think we can do that as we have got real depth in the squad that we have not had for a long time			0
‘ there is pride and passion in wearing the jersey and , under the new head coach , we have gone back to the drawing board and had a good look at ourselves and how we can improve			1
’ @entity1 needs another 10 caps to join the elite band of international centurions but accepts it wo n’t be easy getting them in the run - up to the @entity142			2
with @entity144 and @entity145 first - choice wingers and @entity146 and @entity147 also in contention , he knows it will be difficult to retain a place in the squad in his favoured position although his ability to play also in the centre — as he is likely to do against @entity4 — gives him an extra string to his bow			2
‘ i will never declare myself available for @entity3 , someone will do that for me , ’ added the @entity3 star			2
‘ i am not here to count caps , though			0
i am here to do whatever i can for @entity3			2
it would be a nice landmark to get to 100 caps and if i am playing well and get there , i deserve it			0
if someone is playing well and i do n’t get there , so be it			0
it is whatever is best for @entity3			2
‘ i have gone from saying , “ me first ” , to making sure it is “ @entity3 first ” that is why i will never say i will retire from international rugby			2
i will just become surplus to requirements			0
‘ if i am not used this weekend , that is fine			0
i will not be happy about it but if that is what the boss thinks is best for @entity3 , then that is it			2
