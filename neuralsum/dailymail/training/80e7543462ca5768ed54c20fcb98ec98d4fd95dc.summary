two ' untrained ' sailors who bought their yacht on @entity2 smashed their boat onto rocks after getting lost just 400 yards into what was believed to be one of their first voyages			1
the hapless pair went out in their £ 3,000 24ft vessel but were soon left teetering on a reef near the entrance to @entity13 harbour in @entity14			1
these unnamed sailors had ' little or no knowledge ' of the area or sailing and were attempting to move the yacht from one marina to another - only 700 metres away - when they ran it aground in the dark			0
unaware of the rocks until their pale blue boat @entity26 crashed into them , they were forced into a @entity29 emergency call to the coastguard and a lifeboat was sent to rescue them			1
lost : the pair of rookie sailors were on a 700 metre night - time cruise in the yacht they bought off @entity2 but smashed into rocks but it could not get near the rocks so the local harbour master organised for the bungling seamen to be rescued by a dinghy at 2am yesterday			1
the stranded yacht is now drawing crowds to @entity46 off the @entity47			0
subsequent tides have not been as big as the one that deposited the boat on the rocks and the yacht will remain there until a larger tide comes , or waves smash her to pieces			1
@entity58 , 52 , a plumbing inspector who lives near the harbour entrance , said he awoke yesterday morning to see the stranded yacht			0
he said : ' i woke up and saw the boat on the rocks that is only about 100 metres from the harbour			1
mystery : the two men managed to run aground just short of @entity69 port harbour in @entity14 at the weekend in their £ 3,000 yacht @entity70 ' i heard that the people on board were two @entity74 gentlemen who had clearly not been aware of the reef			1
' they were probably on the high tide at about 1am or 2am because that would have been the best time to move			2
' they were between the queen elizabeth ii marina and the harbour entrance and there is the reef between them			2
' i went out on my boat to have a closer look and i ’d be surprised if it survived when it comes off			0
' there are quite a few people going out to have a look			0
” captain @entity91 , the @entity14 harbour master , said : ' it happened just outside @entity13 and the yacht was attempting to move from the @entity95 marina to another marina inside the harbour			1
error : the boat will not be dislodged unless there is a very high tide , meaning that it is more likely to be smashed to pieces by the waves and rocks ' they were doing it in the middle of the night and the distance is about 700 metres			1
they were about 400 metres into the journey			0
' the people on board had little or no knowledge of the area and were not local			0
they were two men and were uninjured			2
' in the end a harbour dinghy took them off because the lifeboat could n’t reach them			0
' they had been on the top of the tide and it deposited them on the rocks			1
' subsequent tides have not been as big so the yacht has n’t floated off yet			0
the next tide that might do it is this afternoon			2
' if that does n’t do it then it might be lucky to survive because the weather forecast does n’t look good			0
' i heard that the men had bought the yacht off @entity2			2
' a similar thing happened last year with a @entity137 yacht , but before that it was several years before we had another incident			0

the hapless men got caught on the tide in @entity14 and were *dumped* on a reef
@entity26 is still marooned on the rocks and is fast becoming a *tourist* attraction
