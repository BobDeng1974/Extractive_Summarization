by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent last updated at 12:24 pm on 15th december 2011 read the riot act : home secretary @entity3 launched a scathing attack at the findings of a study into the root causes of august 's events most august rioters were hardened criminals driven by a desire for ‘ instant gratification ’ , @entity3 declared last night			1
the home secretary rounded on apologists for the summer riots , dismissing claims those involved had been protesting about spending cuts and police harassment			1
in an unforgiving speech to the @entity20 , she criticised the @entity21 the @entity23 research it conducted jointly with the @entity25 newspaper as ‘ limited ’ , adding that the rioters ’ actions were ‘ inexcusable ’			1
the report claimed the rioters were driven by anger over police stop - and - search techniques			1
but , to heckles from the audience of academics , mrs may said : ‘ nearly two thirds of those brought before the courts were charged with either burglary , robbery or theft – so we know the vast mass of rioters were n’t protesting , as they claimed ; they were thieving			1
‘ the riots were about instant gratification			1
’ facing down barracking from the audience , mrs may said the study had ignored the views of victims and the ‘ law - abiding majority ’ and focused instead on the ‘ excuses ’ of the rioters			1
‘ they would of course try to rationalise and excuse their inexcusable and irrational behaviour , ’ she said			2
speaking later , she said : ‘ what the @entity20 / @entity25 report tells me more than anything is that the rioters still have not accepted responsibility for their actions			1
devastating : this image became one of the iconic images of the riots , @entity3 says a study which spoke to those involved was ' limited ' inexcusable : @entity3 said rioters ' would of course try to rationalise and excuse their inexcusable and irrational behaviour ' ( pictured @entity72 riots ) ‘ they ’re still blaming others – the police , the government , “ society ”			1
they ’re still making excuses			2
but i do n’t accept their excuses because it was their choice to riot and their crimes had consequences			2
’ research conducted by the @entity20 and @entity25 found a deep - seated anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor behind the riots			1
analysts , who studied 270 interviews with people who took part in the disturbances , said distrust and antipathy towards officers was a key driving force behind why thousands took to the streets			2
a complex mix of other political , social and economic factors also contributed , they said			2
out of those questioned , 85 per cent said policing was an ' important ' or ' very important ' factor in why the riots happened			1
it was second only to poverty , which saw 86 per cent of rioters class it as one of the main causes of the four consecutive nights of unrest during the summer			2
poor parenting and gangs were also said to be an important cause of the trouble , which led to the deaths of five people and saw more than 4,000 arrested			2
analysts said the view that the police were ' the biggest gang out there ' was a reoccurring theme among rioters			0
mrs may said the research , followed extensively by the @entity127 , lacked a ‘ control group ’ of non-rioters with impartial views			0
it interviewed very few rioters from outside @entity133 , she said , three from @entity134 , seven from @entity135 and 16 from @entity136			0
‘ it ’s important to highlight the limitations of such a study , limitations that i ’m sure you also all recognise , ’ she said			1
‘ rather than listening solely to the rioters ’ stories , i think it ’s important that we take all of the evidence together and that we draw a more comprehensive and accurate picture of what actually happened this summer			0
’ @entity151 research showed about two - thirds of rioters had convictions or cautions			0
yet the @entity25 / @entity20 research highlighted the one third without convictions			0
the research claimed that deep - seated anger and frustration towards the police was a significant factor behind the riots , with officers ’ incivility a major concern			1
political , social and economic grievances contributed to the unrest , the report said			0
but mrs may said : ‘ in fact , on average each rioter charged had committed 11 previous offences			0
in other words , they were career criminals			0
and these are the very people saying they feel harassed by the police			0
‘ frankly , i ’m delighted that career criminals do n’t like the police , that they feel the police are always targeting them and , as one said , that the police are always “ causing them hell ”			0
’ the riots broke out in @entity72 , @entity133 , on august 6 , following the fatal shooting by police of alleged drug dealer @entity187			1
they spread to other parts of the capital and to other @entity193 cities , including @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity134 and @entity196			0
a thug who set up a @entity199 page called ‘ @entity200 start a riot ’ in august was jailed yesterday			0
@entity202 , 22 , of @entity203 , @entity204 , had admitted intentionally encouraging or assisting in the commission of theft or criminal damage			0
he was jailed for 30 months at @entity208 .			0

home secretary tells *conference* all ' the riots really came down to was money '
