he once labelled climate change ' absolute crap ' , @entity0 was also determined to keep the burning issue off the @entity4 and was unconvinced @entity5 should play any part in the recent global climate negotiations in @entity8 but the prime minister			1
' look , climate change is real			1
@entity10 does contribute to it and it 's important that government make a strong and effective effort to combat it and that is exactly what the @entity5 government is doing			0
' we are absolutely confident that through the various policies we have in place , particularly our direct action plan , our emissions reduction fund , we are very confident that we can reduce our emissions by 12 per cent on 2005 levels by 2020			0
' but mr @entity0 repeated his belief that bushfires , such as those which have crippled parts of @entity5 , @entity29 and @entity30 this summer , are not the by - product of warmer weather caused by climate change			1
' climate change is real '			1
prime minister @entity0 had made a public admission during a tour of bushfire impacted zones across @entity5 prime minister @entity0 tours the @entity39 command centres at the heart of the bushfire zone near @entity42 in @entity43			1
he refutes suggestions climate change has led to more natural disasters in @entity5 ' i think it is wrong to try to attribute particular natural disasters to climate change - that is certainly the warning that the @entity52 has given , it 's the warning that the @entity54 gives , and while there is no doubt that over time climate change could make a difference to these sorts of occurrences , fire , flood , storm are a part of living in @entity5 - always have been , always will be , ' he said			1
however , this stance appears to be in direct conflict with the government 's environment departmental website which reports that there is ' a growing and robust body of evidence ' that the amount of extreme weather events are likely to jump as a result of climate change factors and @entity5 is already being impacted , as evidenced by the number of bushfiires			1
' the important thing is yes we do our bit in tackling climate change but also that we remain very well placed to deal with whatever comes , i think the response to this particular disaster shows that we are well placed to deal with problems , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we think that @entity5 is making a strong and effective contribution to reducing emissions			0
' mr @entity0 infamously declared in 2009 the scientific argument was ' absolute crap ' but has since stated he accepts humans are contributing to global warming			1
a year later he declared that global warming ' has n't increased			1
. the point is not the science '			0
the prime minister has had a chequered , often thorny , relationship with the issue			0
@entity5 only bowed to international pressure and pledged $ 200 million to the @entity99 , to mitigate the impact of global warming on poor countries			2
with the use of coal - fired power and a relatively small population of 23 million , compared to others , @entity5 is considered one of the world 's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters and has been increasingly isolated over a perceived reluctance to do more to tackle the climate threat			0
mr @entity0 speaks with @entity39 volunteers in @entity43			2
the @entity94 has announced victims of the @entity5 bushfires will receive federal assistance during a tour to the bushfire zone ' @entity119 are certainly not a function of climate change , they 're a function of life in @entity5 , ' mr @entity0 has long contended but on thursday he did admit that ' climate change is real ' mr @entity0 , in the past , took a @entity126 executive secretary , @entity125 , to task over her claims that @entity5 bushfires is ' already paying the price of carbon '			1
he accused the official of ' talking through her hat ' and that ' fires are certainly not a function of climate change , they 're a function of life in @entity5 '			2
he also made a point of preventing climate change from being placed on the official agenda of the @entity4 in @entity141 last year and was latterly accused of trying to block @entity5 's involvement in the @entity144 forum in @entity8			2
that subsequently led to a showdown with foreign minister @entity147			0
post the summit , he did n't mince words again , saying ' we are doing a very great deal and i suppose given what we are doing we do n't intend at this time to do more '			0
the @entity94 , who is also the minister for women , lauded the axing of the carbon tax , at the third attempt , as his greatest achievement for female @entity5			0
that 's because women were particularly focused on the household budget , he said at the time			0
and repealing of the carbon tax meant that the average family 's budget was better off by $ 550 a year			0
as opposition leader , mr @entity0 in 2010 was dubbed old fashioned after declaring that housewives would bear the cost of a price on carbon pollution through higher electricity charges as they did the ironing			2
his stance on cutting greenhouse gases emissions has always come with a rider that it should not ' clobber the economy ' .			0

the *pm* reveals that ' climate change is real '
@entity0 admits he believes in global warming on tour of bushfire *ravaged* region around @entity43
he once called the scientific evidence ' absolute crap '
