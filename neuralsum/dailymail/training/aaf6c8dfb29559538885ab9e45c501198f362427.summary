rare gene mutations that increase the risk of a premature heart attack in middle age have been discovered by scientists			1
men under 50 and women under 60 are twice as likely to have a heart attack if they have a faulty gene called @entity9			1
it causes levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides , which can cause clots , to rise			0
men under 50 and women under 60 are twice as likely to have a heart attack ( illustrated with a stock image ) if they have a faulty gene called @entity9			1
it causes levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides , which can cause clots , to rise heart attacks are responsible for millions of deaths around the world and are triggered by both genetic and environmental factors , such as unhealthy lifestyles			2
scientists from the @entity30 , @entity31 and other institutions analysed the genomes of 10,000 people , half of whom suffered a heart attack early in life			1
those that had the heart attacks were found to have mutations in the ldl receptor gene , confirming what has been known for decades – that high levels of @entity47 , or ‘ bad cholesterol , ' raises the risk of heart attack			1
the key finding , however , was that people carrying mutations in the @entity9 ( apolipoprotein a-v ) gene , have higher levels of blood triglycerides – or blood lipids - and a roughly two-fold increased risk of a heart attack			1
while the gene has been previously implicated in the condition , it has only now been confirmed using large - scale dna sequencing to ‘ definitively ’ make the connection between @entity9 and heart attack risk			1
scientists from the @entity30 , @entity31 and other institutions analysed the genomes of 10,000 people , half of whom suffered a heart attack early in life			1
a stock image of a @entity62 sequence is pictured ‘ we simply would n't have made this critical connection without our careful and disciplined approach to whole exome sequencing [ sequencing of the protein - coding portion of the genome ] and subsequent data analysis , ’ said @entity72 , a co-author of the nature study and director of the @entity30 's @entity75			0
researchers hope the findings could lead to new drugs to help reduce the number of heart attacks in middle age			0
dr @entity90 , a cardiologist at @entity31 in @entity91 , said : ‘ our @entity9 result tells us beyond ldl levels - which are well known to contribute to heart attack risk - abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism also play an important role			1
‘ this gives us an important window into the biology of the disease and also suggests potential new avenues for therapeutic development			0
’ the study follows other recent genetic discoveries including the identification of protective mutations in the @entity108 gene , that lower ‘ bad fat ’ levels and the risk of heart attack			1
there are some striking parallels between this new study and similar work conducted over 40 years ago , which was led by @entity118 winner professor @entity117			0
his study examined several hundred people from @entity122 who had suffered a heart attack before the age of 60			2
looking at the levels of fats in the blood , his researchers identified high cholesterol levels as the major link			0
the study has bolstered previous studies that found that @entity47 - the major carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream - causes atherosclerosis ( illustrated using computer artwork ) , where fats accumulate in blood vessels and lead to a heart attack that work spurred decades of research trying to unravel the role of @entity47 - the major carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream - in causing atherosclerosis , where fats accumulate in blood vessels and lead to a heart attack			2
interestingly the second most common abnormality observed by @entity147 and his colleagues was elevated blood triglycerides , but he was unable to explain this comprehensively at the time			0
dr @entity90 and his colleagues also found harmful ldl receptor mutations are roughly twice as common than had been estimated in the @entity117 study			0
he said : ‘ in 1973 @entity117 ’s work taught us what types of lipids in the blood are most important for early heart attack risk			2
now after sequencing all of the genes in the genome we can directly point to the specific genes that are most important			0
there is remarkable consistency between the observations from 40 years ago and today			0
’ only about five per cent of people who suffer a heart attack do so at a relatively young age			2
but tragically the first sign of illness in this minority is often a devastating heart attack inflicting significant damage to the heart and resulting in severe disability or even death			2
there are 230,000 heart attacks in the @entity181 every year - with about one - in - ten proving fatal .			0

scientists from the @entity30 , @entity31 have *pinpointed* rare mutations in a gene called @entity9
mutations increase a person 's risk of having a heart attack early in life
they disable the gene , while raising the levels of a type of fat in the blood
while only five per cent of people who suffer a heart attack do so before 50 , the first sign of illness is often the devastating attack itself
