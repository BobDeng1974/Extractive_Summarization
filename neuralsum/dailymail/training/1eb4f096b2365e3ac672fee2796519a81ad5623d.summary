@entity30 , for the @entity26 , said : ' when questioned about it by her colleague , told her that she would send it to her husband and her daughter who would find it funny			2
' the baby was in quite an unsettled state and the registrant took the baby rather roughly in her hands and as a result of that the baby was sick over her			2
' @entity20 's colleague put the baby back and remonstrated with the registrant about the rough handling and took the baby in her arms			1
' the registrant went away and came back with a bottle of milk which her colleague saw without a teat on it			2

the midwife had previously sent the mother home after claiming that she was not in labour			0
mr @entity30 continued : ' the upshot of that was that when the mother did eventually give birth she did so in the ambulance taking her back to the hospital			0
' her husband was with her at the time and he was very scared as to what was going on			0
' when they arrived at the hospital there was a conversation which took place between the father and the registrant , part of which was overheard by a colleague			0
' the father explained that he was very scared and she had no idea why he was scared because she had explained what he had to do when they got home			0
