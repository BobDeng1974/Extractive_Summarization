this year 's crop of virgin olive oil has been severely affected by drought in southern @entity3 @entity4 and @entity5 might have to rethink some recipes after warnings of an international shortage of extra virgin olive oil			1
the ingredient , generously drizzled over everything from salads to pasta dishes and roasted vegetables , has fallen victim to weather extremes			0
while @entity19 suffered its wettest summer in 100 years during 2012 , the farmers of @entity18 were struggling to cope with a drought			1
as a result , the @entity18 harvest is predicted to be down by as much as 60 per cent , creating shortages of extra virgin olive oil and pushing up prices			1
perversely , @entity19 retailers are currently using olive oil as a loss leader , cutting the price in order to attract middle class shoppers who will also spend on other products			1
@entity36 , for example , is offering five extra virgin olive oils at half price , ranging from £ 1.74 to £ 2.84 for 500ml			0
however , olive oil experts insist that the economics of the market mean this can not last			2
the @entity43 , an @entity45 based co-operative of more than 50,000 farmers , grows and presses more olives than anyone else in the world			0
its @entity19 representative , @entity50 , said : ‘ with the harvest drawing to a close latest returns are showing that the @entity18 olive crop is a fraction of previous years			1
‘ the crop forecast is for 700,000 tonnes of olives in 2013 against 1.6m tonnes last year following a sustained period of drought			0
‘ there will be a shortage of certain types of olive oil and this will definitely put upward pressure on prices			2
’ mr @entity50 said the current supermarket price cuts ‘ would be unsustainable even if supplies were abundant ’			0
he added : ‘ with a shortage on the way the current situation ca n’t last			0
’ other olive oil producing countries , including @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , have had their own drought problems and will not be able to make up the shortfall from @entity18			1
the situation is expected to fuel a burgeoning black market in stolen olive oil and an increase in the widespread adulteration of olive oil with cheap substitutes by food fraudsters			2
kitchen favourite : popular chefs such as @entity4 , left , and @entity88 , right , often use extra virgin olive oil in their recipes just before christmas one @entity19 firm was fined more than £ 20,000 for passing off a cheap pesto sauce as something far more gourmet			1
@entity95 claimed its pesto was made with extra virgin olive oil and @entity99 cheese , when in fact it was sunflower oil and a cheaper @entity102 cheese			2
in @entity104 , a company called @entity105 is facing a lawsuit over its @entity108 brand of ‘ 100 % pure olive oil ’			2
the case is being brought by the @entity112 @entity111 , which claims the product is actually olive pomace oil , a substance extracted using industrial solvents from the solid waste matter from olive oil mills , and not from olives			2
last july , @entity18 police arrested the leader of a gang responsible for the theft of more than a million litres of the olive oil , which was then shipped to @entity74 for sale			1
in 2011 , two @entity18 businessmen were sent to prison for selling extra virgin olive oil that turned out to be 75per cent sunflower oil			1
mr @entity50 said consumers need to careful when buying olive oil to make sure they are getting what they expect			0
‘ if the bottle does not have the words ‘ extra virgin ’ on it , then it is more than likely a blend containing refined oils , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s a big difference between an extra virgin olive oil and refined olive oils which should cost less			0
‘ the irony is that highly processed refined oils are often sold in the @entity19 at similar prices to extra virgin which are the least processed and most natural olive oils			0
‘ no self - respecting @entity151 would pay the same price for refined as extra virgin olive oil			0
’ @entity154 is the market leader in @entity18 with around 215,000 tonnes produced every year , which is four times total @entity19 consumption .			1
