the @entity0 is saving £ 1.1billion a year compared to than seven years ago after slashing 1,000 staff and top talent - but could still have to take the axe to programmes , its finance director has warned			1
publishing a new report on ‘ @entity0 efficiency ’ , @entity6 said the corporation still needs to find an extra £ 400million a year by 2017 and ' the challenge to avoid having to cut content is very real '			1
the cuts included £ 35million a year from the £ 229million - a - year talent budget compared to five years ago , after widespread criticism of high salaries paid to top stars			1
@entity0 finance director @entity6 ( above ) said @entity17 needs to save an extra £ 400million a year the departures of @entity19 and @entity20 have helped reduce the annual @entity0 talent budget former @entity0 presenters prompted anger when their salaries were revealed , including the £ 6million a year reportedly paid to @entity25 before he moved to @entity26 in 2010			1
@entity27 presenter @entity20 was also thought to be earning more than £ 500,000 before he left this year - with the highest - paid ' talent ' now thought to be stars such as @entity30 and @entity31			2
the departure of @entity19 , who departed for @entity26 and a reported £ 400,000 salary in april , has also helped trim @entity0 budgets			2
but because many of the other cuts that were made to date - including more than 1,000 redundancies and a string of property sales - were one - off savings , bosses are expected to target the @entity0 programming budget next to save more cash			1
the @entity0 ’s director general @entity44 has already announced plans to axe youth channel @entity46 and make it online - only , angering many of his own tv presenters			1
but according to an insider , bosses are prepared to make further ‘ tough choices ’ in order to save more money , meaning services such as the arts channel @entity55 could also find itself under threat			0
@entity0 director general @entity44 has already announced plans to axe @entity46 and now @entity55 is under threat a source said yesterday that it is ‘ increasingly likely ’ that other stations and programmes will be slimmed down or cut as the corporation puts further pressure on its budgets			1
although no plans have been drawn up , the @entity0 would prefer to make a few dramatic cuts , such as by axing an entire channel , than to make many smaller savings to programme budgets			0
miss @entity6 , who is paid £ 395,000 as the @entity0 ’s managing director of finance and operations , said : ‘ many savings delivered in this charter period come from structural or one - off initiatives that ca n’t easily be repeated , making it more likely that content and services will be impacted if the real terms value of the @entity81 continues to be reduced			2
’ in recent years , the @entity0 has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money			0
the controversial it project known as the @entity85 was axed by @entity44 at a cost of £ 100million to the licence fee payer			0
and the corporation was castigated by mps after a report by the @entity91 discovered it had handed out £ 369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years			0
stars such as @entity95 , left , have criticised the decision to axe @entity46 and make it online - only however , miss @entity6 argued that the @entity0 ’s efficiency ‘ compares well ’ to @entity102 departments and boasted that it is ‘ on track ’ to achieve £ 1.5billion in savings by 2017			1
to save more money , @entity44 will introduce a ‘ compete or compare ’ strategy that will force programme makers to slash their costs and compete with independent production companies			0
the decision to axe @entity46 – which is expected to save around £ 100million a year – must be approved by the corporation ’s governing body before it can go ahead			2
stars including comedian @entity95 and dj @entity111 have already criticised the idea in public			0
in 2010 , the @entity0 was forced to abandon plans to axe @entity115 after its stars organised a vocal public protest .			0

a new report on @entity0 efficiency said an extra £ 400 million had to be cut
@entity17 has already saved £ 1.1billion a year by sacking 1,000 staff
£ 35million has also been shaved off the £ 229million spend on ' talent '
it came after high salaries including £ 6m for *ex-bbc* star @entity25
director general @entity44 *previously* announced the end of @entity46
now , @entity55 is under threat as part of the new cash - saving measures
