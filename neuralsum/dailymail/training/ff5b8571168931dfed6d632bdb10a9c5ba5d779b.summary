it would have been the quirkiest of funerals			0
the coffin was to be driven in the same hearse that once carried @entity5 , then brought into the crematorium to the sound of @entity8 , a 2003 pop hit by @entity11 duo @entity10			0
inside , the relatives would be waiting in specially selected fancy dress			0
and @entity14 , just 14 , was to be laid to rest sporting his pink mohawk hair cut and wearing a suit			1
second chance : @entity14 staying positive in hospital , pictured during his fight with cancer ‘ i thought i should probably turn up at my own funeral reasonably well dressed , ’ he says with a wry smile			1
but the boy who had suffered two types of cancer and was given just days to live last december has now found himself on an unexpected road to recovery – one so astonishing it has left the medical community dumbfounded			1
@entity14 , too , is finding it difficult to understand			1
while others are rejoicing at his good fortune , he is trying to come to terms with his miraculous survival			0
‘ he found it easier to deal with dying , ’ admits his mother @entity35 , 33			0
‘ he described it as having an open door in front of you with a light , and you know that when you walk through that door all pain will end and you will be free			0
he was told he would n't see @entity47 , but @entity14 , who is the only person in the world to suffer from both leukaemia and another rare form of cancer has made a miraculous recovery doctors are at a loss to explain why @entity14 , who is one of just five people in the world with @entity57 , has had such a miraculous recovery ‘ and then someone slams that door shut in your face			1
’ after four years of fighting and , eventually , finding himself at peace with the prospect of his own death , @entity14 has had every certainty removed , says his father @entity68			1
‘ he actually stopped eating on purpose in the hope that it would kill him because he was so disappointed that he now was n’t dying			0
he wanted an end to it			0
’ @entity14 ’s story is one that is both uplifting and perplexing			1
his family members and his doctors think that his amazing recovery might have been his incredible positivity in his attitude towards both life and death in 2010 , aged ten , he was diagnosed with leukaemia			1
eighteen months later , he was told he had a secondary cancer , the extremely rare @entity85 cell sarcoma			1
only 50 cases have been recorded and only five people in the world have it			2
but no one had ever had the two cancers combined			0
doctors told the @entity14 family that the only hope was a bone marrow transplant			1
the 14 - year - old was diagnosed with the condition 18 months after he began battling leukaemia in 2010 the family moved from their home in @entity102 , @entity103 , and bounced between temporary hostels in @entity105 , the city where @entity14 ’s transplants took place			1
the first took place in march 2013 and during the following months three more attempts were made			0
after the final transplant , doctors took @entity35 and @entity68 into a small room at a @entity105 hospital			2
with @entity14 ’s body now in the grip of three major infections ( the transplants had stripped him of his immune system ) , including a superbug that caused three of his fingers to go black and necrotic , they were told : ‘ this is the end			1
’ the teenager underwent four bone marrow transplants - including two using his own stem cells - to try and make his body produce his own blood products again the cancer survivor had an incredibly resilient outlook , smiling while fighting off infection and undergoing treatment before he found out he was going to survive , @entity14 had come to terms completely with the prospect of his own death , his family saying that he was ' looking forward to what was coming next ' the family thought the painful saga of @entity14 ’s years of treatment , from dose after dose of vicious drugs , radiation , chemotherapy and more than 300 procedures , was finally over			1
as time ran out for him , @entity35 even dyed her hair a vivid pink to cheer up her son			0
‘ all that was keeping @entity14 alive were the antibiotics , which i thought of as a form of life - support machine , ’ says @entity35			1
‘ the hospital told us that if we took him off them , his body simply would not be able to fight the three major infections he had			2
‘ so we took the decision , 50 days after his final bone marrow transplant , when we thought that it had totally failed , to take @entity14 off the antibiotics			1
’ many celebrities rallied behind @entity14 in order to help him complete his ' bucket list ' before he died			1
( @entity166 : @entity14 with comedian @entity167 ) as @entity35 looked at her son – thin , pale and with lips black from infection – she accepted she needed to prepare for his death as he had now done			2
‘ @entity14 said that when he finally accepted he was going to die , it was the best day of his life because it gave him this calm and peaceful feeling , like he finally had control over his life and where he was going , ’ says @entity35			2
‘ he said he was looking forward to see what was coming next – the next adventure			0
’ indeed , @entity14 ’s relentless optimism , even in the face of failed surgeries and devastating chemotherapy , had brought numerous celebrities to his bedside as they helped him tick off his bucket list			2
tv star @entity187 helped @entity14 fulfill a dream by taking him for a spin in a series of fancy cars @entity14 's father @entity68 had been a contestant on the @entity193 , prompting the judge @entity187 to get in touch with him when he heard the news about @entity14 @entity68 had been a contestant on the @entity193 in 2011 , and in november 2013 judge @entity187 got in touch to arrange a day for @entity14 to ride in supercars , including a @entity198 and @entity199			2
once off the antibiotics , however , the doctors gave @entity14 less than a week to live			1
the family moved into a hospice on december 11 , and he said his final goodbyes			0
‘ we had @entity47 on december 14 because we did n’t think that he would make it to the 25th , ’ says @entity35			2
yet as @entity47 rolled into @entity209 , it became apparent to both @entity14 and his parents that his body was not being ravaged by infection , nor were his organs shutting down as the doctors had predicted			1
@entity14 remained consistently upbeat until the very point he thought he was going to die , right before his recovery , displaying a relentless optimism in the face of his own mortality then , in the second week of january – almost a month after @entity14 had been given just days to live – he accidentally tore the bandages off one of his fingers			1
what emerged was not a finger raw to the bone but one that seemed completely healed			0
‘ it was a miracle , ’ says @entity35			0
‘ the doctors could n’t comprehend how he had managed to totally fight off the vicious infection in his fingers without any bone marrow , without an immune system and without drugs			2
they still ca n’t explain it			0
‘ all of a sudden , the doctors were saying @entity14 could have a chance , though they could offer us no explanation as to how			1
’ two weeks later , the doctors confirmed that he was producing white blood cells			0
some 104 days after his fourth and final bone marrow transplant the cells had finally grafted			0
it was something that had never been seen before , and was deemed by the doctors as ‘ impossible ’			0
‘ two months ago we were getting ready to cremate @entity14 and now they are telling us that his treatment is over , ’ @entity35 adds			2
now the @entity244 are forming their own charity , @entity246 , which will run residential camps for young teenagers diagnosed with cancer			0
brave cancer sufferer @entity14 pictured with @entity251 @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 during his fight with the disease originally intended as a legacy , @entity68 says @entity14 plans to be the charity ’s driving force , putting his experiences to good use			1
‘ @entity14 is finally feeling like he can have a purpose in life , ’ says @entity35			2
‘ a few weeks ago he was thinking merely in hours , and now he is thinking in days and years , about having a career , running the charity and moving abroad			0
‘ for the first time in four years , he can picture his own future			0

@entity14 is one of five people on the planet to get the rare disease
he had been preparing for his own funeral before he began his recovery
was told that ' he would n't see @entity47 by doctors '
medical professionals are now puzzled as to how he has survived
his parents claim that during the ordeal he was ' relentlessly optimistic '
