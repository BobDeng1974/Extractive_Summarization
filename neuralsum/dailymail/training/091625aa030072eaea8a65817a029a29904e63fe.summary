by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 man who found what could be the oldest forged coins in history while out treasure hunting with his son says he will use his fortune to ' buy a new metal detector '			1
@entity11 , 37 , dug up the trove of 300 forged silver coins worth nearly £ 120,000 - more than ten times what he earns a year as a council worker			1
but the father , who found the ancient @entity19 coins with the help of son @entity21 , 13 , immediately told the authorities and will now lose nearly all of the money because of local treasure hunting rules			1
despite being forgeries of the 2,350 - year - old @entity29 currency , experts say each 5mm penny is worth £ 400			1
the haul of 309 whole coins and 40 fragments is worth around £ 120,000 , according to currency experts @entity11 , 37 , found the ancient @entity19 forged coins near the site of a medieval village in northern @entity3 the father and son found 309 whole coins believed to be worth £ 400 each , as well as 40 fragments of the forged currency , but went straight to the authorities with their haul			1
they are believed to be the oldest counterfeit coins ever found , and were produced just 400 years after the first ever coins were made			2
the pair are now likely to receive £ 12,000 - just 10 per cent of the estimated total value of the forged coins - while the rest goes to the government			1
mr @entity11 said : ' it is still more than i earn in a year from my job but i have never done this for money			1
' there are those in the area that say i was foolish not to have kept the lot , and could easily have sold them abroad with nobody any the wiser			2
' but my son would have known , and what sort of an example is that for a boy to get from his father ? i do n't have any regrets			2
' i thought to be an example for my son			0
he is passionate about history			0
mr @entity11 said they were using an old metal detector that was worth around £ 120 when he bought it , but is now considering an upgrade			1
' if i get something , i 'll buy a new metal detector , ' he added			0
each 2,350 - year - old silver coin is thought to be worth £ 400 , even though it was made as a forgery the @entity81 found the silver coins in a 25 metres squared area of the @entity85 region of northern @entity3 , near the site of a long - abandoned medieval village			1
the coins , which weigh 1.5kg altogether , were buried at depths between two inches and two feet			0
experts believe they are forgeries of the ancient @entity93 currency and could be around 2,350 years old , dating back to when @entity94 reigned over the then @entity95 of @entity96			2
most of the coins show a @entity19 solider on horseback on one side and a face on the other			1
local historian @entity103 said : ' they are made of raw silver , quite good workmanship , quite good copies but that 's what they are - copies of @entity19 coins			1
' however , in ancient times it was the quality of the silver that was important , and he said that exchanging parts of coins was an way of giving change			2
he said : ' if you had something that cost half a penny , and you only had a penny , you simply cut it in half which would explain why there were also fragments			0
' the coins will be restored and taken to @entity126 in north - eastern @entity3 , where they will be put on display			2
mr @entity11 said : ' we have never found anything much before			2
the odd coin - but mostly just bullet cases , old tins or rusty nails			0
' it can be a bit disheartening but it was fun to spend time together and of course dream we would one day find something			0
' but in the latest expedition , that was exactly what happened when the father and son team heard a huge bleep and began digging out an astonishing haul of coins			1
' we found one , then another , then another , then a pile of them			0
we could n't believe it			0
we were pulling them up in handfuls , ' he said			0
' it is every treasure hunter 's dream			0
