a filter - feeding ' lobster ' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown			1
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders			1
at this length it would have been comparable in size to athlete @entity15 , actor @entity16 and former wrestler @entity17			0
a giant filter - feeding ' lobster ' ( illustrated left ) took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown			1
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature was an early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders and at this length would have been comparable in size to athlete @entity15 ( pictured right ) the remains were unearthed in @entity28 and it is thought to be the oldest giant filter - feeder ever discovered			1
but while most of its relatives were shark - like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth , the new species , named @entity32 , was a ' gentle giant '			0
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders			1
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head			1
fossils also show that @entity32 had pairs of swimming flaps along its body			0
these were likely to be precursors of the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans			2
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head			1
modern - day lobsters grow to around 19 inches ( 50cm ) and modern - day whales average at around 79ft ( 25 metres )			1
dr @entity67 , from @entity68 , who co-led a team studying @entity32 writing in the journal nature , said : ' this would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time			0
' these animals are filling an ecological role that had n't previously been filled by any other animal			0
' while filter - feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food , previous filter - feeders were smaller , and usually attached to the sea - floor			1
' we have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter - feeder			1
' a. benmoulae was named after the @entity28 fossil hunter who discovered it , @entity92			2
the @entity94 fossil , exposed using tiny needle - like tools to chip away the surrounding rock , is exceptionally well preserved			0

the three - dimensional fossil ( pictured ) , exposed using tiny needle - like tools to chip away the surrounding rock , is ' exceptionally well preserved '			0
other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat , like pressed leaves the fossils ( pictured left and right ) also show that @entity32 had pairs of swimming flaps along its body , which were likely to be precursors to the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans			1
they also bear resemblance to gill flaps seen on the trunks of modern arthropods dr @entity67 , from @entity68 said : ' this would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time			0

' the fossil 's individual parts are annotated above in contrast , other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat , like pressed leaves			0
' without these @entity94 remains we may never have got the insight into these animals ' anatomy that we did , ' said dr @entity137			0

the large size of this filter feeder suggests that the anomalocaridids were well - adapted to take advantage of a presumably rich source of plankton during the @entity156 period , said the authors			2
the fossils were found in the @entity160 formation region of central anti-atlas in @entity28 ( marked ) modern lobsters ( stock image ) grow to around 19 in ( 50cm ) and modern whales average at 79ft ( 25 metres )			2

remains of the two - metre ( 6.5ft ) prehistoric creature unearthed in @entity28
it lived 480 million years ago and belonged to the family of anomalocaridids
these were early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food
fossils suggest it caught food using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
and *experts* claim it is the oldest giant filter - feeder ever discovered
