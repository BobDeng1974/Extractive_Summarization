by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 12:21 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 1 august 2013 a catholic priest admitted to a psychiatrist he had molested more than 100 boys , including his 5 - year - old brother , had sex with male prostitutes and visited gay strip clubs while serving in a @entity11 parish for years , according to explosive documents released overnight			1
@entity14 's vile confessions are among nearly 2,000 pages of secret church documents on a dozen religious order priests , brothers and nuns accused of sexually abusing children while working in the @entity22 archdiocese over several decades			1
the papers , released under the terms of a $ 660 million settlement agreement reached in 2007 , are the first glimpse at what religious orders knew about the men and women they posted in @entity32 schools and parishes around @entity22			1
the @entity34 , which takes in the @entity35 ( pictured ) , has agreed to pay $ 660 million to 500 victims of sexual abuse dating back as far as the 1940s the archdiocese itself released thousands of pages under court order this year for its own priests who were accused of sexual abuse , but the full picture of the problem remained elusive without the orders ' records			1
several dozen more files are expected to be released by the fall			1
the documents cover five different religious orders that employed 10 priests or religious brothers and two nuns who were all accused in civil lawsuits of molesting children			1
among them , the accused had 21 alleged victims between the 1950s and the 1980s			0
some of the files released yesterday , including those of the nuns , do n't mention sexual abuse at all , and others appear to have large gaps in time and missing documents			1
lead attorney for some abuse victims , @entity68 , said the files do n't detail all the abuse which happened the release included documents from the @entity74 , the @entity75 , the @entity76 and two orders for religious sisters			2
that the files do n't reflect some of the alleged abuse does n't mean it did n't happen , said @entity68 , lead attorney for some abuse victims			2
' much of this went unreported			0
you 're talking about kids that were terrorized and frightened in so many different ways , with no place and no one to turn to , ' he said			0
at more than 500 pages , 72 - year - old @entity14 's file is among the most complete , and it paints a devastating picture of a troubled and repressed child who later joined the priesthood to satisfy a domineering and devout father			1
the @entity22 archdiocese settled eight lawsuits over @entity14 's actions in 2007 , but had little documentation on him in its own files even though the priest worked in its parishes for years in the 1970s and 1980s			1
however , his order file includes graphic details described in therapy notes and psychiatric evaluations			0
it also reveals the years of effort — and tens of thousands of dollars — the @entity74 spent trying to cure him of his self - admitted pedophilia as it shuttled him between programs , including inpatient treatment			2
in 1965 , @entity14 took his final vows for a religious order called the @entity115 of the @entity74 , a nearly 200 - year - old @entity32 organization with roots in @entity117			1
in 1969 , he was ordained as a priest and assigned by his order to a small parish in @entity121 , @entity122			2
in a 1993 psychiatric report — one of several such evaluations done between 1991 and 2005 by various treatment programs — the priest admitted to molesting children beginning in 1970 , when he began playing ' giddy up ' games with young boys on his lap. in the documents , @entity14 says he stopped ' direct sexual contact ' with boys after a mother complained to a pastor in 1982 and that he stopped touching boys altogether after another complaint in 1986			1
it 's unclear whether his religious order or the archdiocese was aware of those complaints , but around the same time as the first complaint , @entity14 began weekly therapy sessions			1
he entered a counseling program for people with sexual compulsions after the second complaint in 1986			0
archbishop of @entity149 ( left ) , pictured outside @entity11 's @entity35 , has defended his handling of sexual abuse complaints in 1991 , he received five months of inpatient psychological treatment from a center in @entity154 , @entity155 , that specialized in treating troubled priests			1
upon his release , @entity14 was assigned to a tiny parish in the remote town of @entity160 , @entity11 , in the far southeastern corner of the state			2
while there , he would drive miles to @entity165 to pick up male prostitutes , according to his file			0
he was removed from parish ministry in 1993 , enrolled in a sex offender program and sent to live and work at the order 's @entity11 headquarters in @entity174 after another complaint surfaced from his past			0
for the rest of his career , he filled administrative roles			0
calls to the @entity115 of the @entity74 and emails to two attorneys representing @entity14 and the three other @entity184 priests whose files were released were not returned			1
attorneys for the @entity76 and @entity75 and a representative from the @entity188 also did not return calls			0
@entity189 , a spokeswoman for the @entity22 archdiocese , did not address the current file release specifically but said religious orders are expected to make sure the priests they present for ministry in the archdiocese do n't have any history of sex abuse			1
one man who sued over @entity14 's abuse said the priest molested children after he was assigned to his hometown parish in @entity204 , a working - class city south of @entity22 , in 1972			1
the man , now 50 , requested anonymity because he is well - known in his professional life and has not spoken publicly about his case before			0
@entity0 does not publish the names of victims of sexual abuse without their consent			1
' he would have us wrestle each other and then wrestle with him , which means we 'd get down into our skivvies and he 'd take pictures of us			0
he was always taking pictures , ' the man said			0
' i just remember the smell of the old @entity223 flash cubes			0
he would go through them like crazy			0
' the man received a settlement in 2007 from the archdiocese			0
@entity14 was never charged criminally ; most of his alleged abuses were n't reported until years later			0
abuse victims @entity230 , right , and @entity231 , left , hold a quilt bearing the portraits of abused children outside the @entity35 , @entity11 , in february the man said @entity14 always had a group of young boys around him and would take them to see r - rated movies and on group trips			1
one summer day , he recalled , the priest took six boys to a local amusement park , but stopped on the way at an apartment where another man lived			0
@entity14 and the man went inside with one of the boys and left the other five in the car for several hours			2
when the trio came back , the boy was sobbing and did n't stop for hours			0
@entity14 has a most recent address at the @entity252 in @entity174 , @entity11			0
no one answered the door there and a call was not returned yesterday			0
a receptionist at a @entity259 retreat home for troubled priests — another possible place where @entity14 could be living — would not say if he was there			2
in 2003 , after a decade in at the order 's @entity11 headquarters , @entity14 was moved to the @entity74 ' offices in @entity265 , where he worked answering phones and in the archives			2
there , his files show , he was reprimanded for making off - color , sexual jokes that offended several women and , later , for looking at sexually suggestive pictures of young boys on the @entity275 and downloading a floppy disk filled with ' references to topics dealing with the gay lifestyle '			1
' i do n't know who else has time to monitor him , or to what ' safe ' place we could assign him , ' the reverend @entity285 , the vicar provincial and director of personnel for the @entity74 wrote in an exasperated memo in 2003			0
the file shows that @entity14 was sent to the @entity259 retreat home for troubled priests in 2005			2
in a psychiatric assessment dated that same year , @entity14 said he had n't had sexual contact with a child in 23 years and had learned to control his impulses			1
the same report notes that at age 13 , @entity14 sexually molested his little brother and went on to molest ' about 100 male minors ' — a detail also included in several others therapy evaluations in the file			1
' it has not been easy to face what i did , to admit it and to talk about it with others , ' @entity14 wrote to the order 's provincial in 2006			2
' i have had to deal with depression , self - hatred , the inability and unwillingness to forgive myself , and the desire and tendency to isolate			0
