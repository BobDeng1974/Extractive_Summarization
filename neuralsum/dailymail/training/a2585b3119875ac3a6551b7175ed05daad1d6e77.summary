by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @entity2 @entity3 believes the retirement of @entity5 and @entity6 has given him the chance to shine on the international stage			1
@entity6 followed @entity9 skipper @entity5 in announcing his decision to step down from the @entity9 set - up this week			1
@entity11 has responded by including @entity3 – and @entity13 ’s @entity12 – in his squad for next month ’s friendly with @entity16 and @entity17 qualifier in @entity18			1
‘ my football is going really well at the moment and this is the icing on the cake after moving here			2
‘ there ’s been a few retirements since the @entity31 , in ( @entity5 ) @entity5 and ( @entity6 ) @entity6 , which has left a hole			0
‘ i ’m not saying i ’m necessarily their replacement but there are opportunities there for young players to stake a claim			0
‘ the manager took a few young players to the @entity31 in the summer and has now named a young squad , so that shows you always have a chance			1
i ’ve got to go there , express myself in training and hopefully be a part of the games			0
i want to show people what i am capable of and i know that once i ’ve experienced it once , i will want to do it again			0
‘ i ’ve just got to go there and do what i ’ve been doing at club level , hopefully impress them and stay in the squad			1
’ giving youth a chance : @entity11 has named a fairly inexperienced squad for the friendly with @entity16 and @entity17 qualifier in @entity18 highest praise : @entity11 has labelled @entity3 as the ' ginger @entity79 ' after calling the @entity35 midfielder up to the @entity9 squad @entity3 only learned of his call up on thursday morning , as he explained : ‘ i was in the gym when @entity84 ( toward , team administrator ) came in and said he had received the paperwork saying i was involved			1
‘ if it had been anyone else i would n’t have believed it , but the manager had pulled me this morning to say that @entity9 had rang to check if i was fit , so therefore i may have a chance			1
when @entity84 confirmed it , i believed it			0
‘ to be honest , before today , when it comes to the time of the squad being announced , i ’ve never really taken much notice or thought about it			2
‘ i ’ve never been involved before , not even much as a young lad , and sometimes it can be difficult to get in there when you have n’t been around it before			0
‘ i just always wanted to concentrate on playing well for the team and doing well for @entity103 - not individual performances			2
‘ that ’s why it has come as a surprise			0
it is a massive bonus in my career , a challenge i will relish and it will be a great experience			0

@entity3 and @entity12 have been called up to the @entity9 squad
the *24* - year - old believes he can shine on the international stage
@entity11 labelled him as the ' @entity117 '
