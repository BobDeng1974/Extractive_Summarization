by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 no @entity3 : mr @entity4 hinted that not keeping the pound would be like settling for second best @entity4 has admitted there is no acceptable ' @entity3 ' if an independent @entity7 is barred from using the @entity9 pound			1
the first minister said dropping the pound ' implies settling for what 's second best ' - but still insisted there will be a deal on a currency union with the rest of the @entity9			1
his admission came as @entity19 leader @entity18 revealed he will campaign again a currency union in the event of a ' yes ' vote			1
in an open letter to voters , mr @entity4 set out why he has not yielded to calls to disclose a back - up plan , if his favoured option of sharing the pound and the @entity29 fails			1
the letter , published in the @entity31 , declared : ' it is revealing that our opponents in the no camp like to talk about a " @entity3 " on currency			1
' it 's revealing because it says it all about what they think of @entity7			2
' @entity3 implies settling for what 's second best			1
and neither myself , my colleagues in the @entity43 , or the wider yes campaign will ever settle for second best for @entity7			2
' the last thing i would do is back a plan which was n't the best one for @entity7			0
' he said @entity7 would be ' willing and able ' to take on its share of national debt , but could not be expected to do so if it does not get a fair share of the @entity29			0
' that means taxpayers in the rest of the @entity9 would be lumbered with up to £ 5billion a year in debt interest payments , ' he wrote			0
' and @entity7 would start life as an independent country debt - free			0
that 's just one of the many good reasons there will be a currency union			1
@entity18 has revealed he will make a manifesto commitment to block a ‘ currency union ’ with a separate @entity7 as voters urgently demand a ‘ plan b ’ from @entity4			1
mr @entity4 's preference would see @entity7 retain the @entity29 as its lender of last resort			0
a new @entity85 poll for the @entity7 @entity86 has revealed that a staggering 69 per cent of @entity7 want the @entity87 to draw up alternatives to keeping the pound before september ’s referendum			0
four - fifths of respondents said the choice of currency is important to them in the case of separation , demonstrating the scale of the crisis now facing the @entity43			0
following tuesday ’s bruising tv debate with @entity101 , when mr @entity4 failed to answer questions about his ‘ plan b ’ , the first minister has since childishly claimed ‘ it ’s @entity7 ’s pound and we ’re keeping it ’			1
veto : @entity18 has revealed he will make a manifesto pledge to block a currency union with @entity7 on thursday , he bizarrely argued that the rest of the @entity9 would have to accept a deal because it would be the ‘ sovereign will ’ of the people of @entity7 following a @entity112 vote			1
but on a visit to @entity115 yesterday , @entity19 leader mr @entity18 said that should @entity7 vote to leave the @entity116 , he would stand on a platform in next year ’s @entity118 to rule out a deal			2
if he won the election , that would give him a clear mandate from the people of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
@entity7 finance secretary @entity127 yesterday said the cross-party refusal ' will crumble after a @entity112 vote ' in the face of higher costs to @entity9 businesses to trade with @entity7			0
' if alarm bells were ringing after tuesday night , they should be ringing much , much louder when you ’ve got them saying we ’re going to default on our debts ' - @entity18 but mr @entity18 said only 10 per cent of @entity9 trade goes to @entity7 and pointed out that 40 per cent of @entity9 trade goes to @entity141 , which has not compelled @entity9 to join the euro			2
former @entity19 chancellor @entity101 also said the @entity143 would be ' phlegmatic ' about paying @entity7 ’s share of the debt – around £ 5billion a year from the @entity143 ’s £ 700billion budget			0
mr @entity18 said mr @entity4 has had ‘ 40 years to come up with an answer , and with 40 days to go he still has no answer ’			0
he added : ' if alarm bells were ringing after tuesday night , they should be ringing much , much louder when you ’ve got them saying we ’re going to default on our debts '			0
asked if he would include a pledge in his 2015 general election manifesto to veto a currency union , mr @entity18 replied : ' yes			1
i ’m ruling it out now			0
' plans : labour leader @entity18 speaks to @entity19 leader @entity161 in @entity115 yesterday the new @entity85 poll shows that 56 per cent of @entity112 voters want mr @entity4 to draw up a ‘ plan b ’ , with only 35 per cent content for the first minister to remain silent			1
the alternatives are a separate @entity7 currency – either pegged to the pound or with a flexible exchange rate - joining the euro , or using the pound unilaterally in the way that @entity174 and @entity175 use the @entity177 dollar			2
keeping the pound is by far the preferred option for @entity7 , but if a deal is ruled out a separate currency pegged to the pound is the most popular , according to the poll			2
mr @entity4 has gambled his political future on convincing voters that @entity19 , the @entity186 and the @entity187 are bluffing when they said they would rule out a currency union			1
the poll shows that 40 per cent agree with this , and 39 per cent of @entity7 believe they are telling the truth .			0
