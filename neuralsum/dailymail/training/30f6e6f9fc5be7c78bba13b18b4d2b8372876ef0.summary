the @entity2 nurse who became the first person to contract @entity4 outside @entity5 appears to have overcome the disease , officials said tonight			2
@entity7 , 44 , went into isolation after caring for two infected priests at @entity10 in central @entity11			1
her case prompted a massive public outcry of the @entity2 government 's handling of the outbreak , which blew up into mass protests when her beloved dog @entity20 was put down despite it being unclear whether the pet had the virus			1
but her dog @entity20 ( pictured ) was put down as a precaution , sparking a national outcry innocent : some 390,000 animal rights activists and protesters called for @entity20 ( pictured ) to be spared death row : @entity20 barking on ms @entity7 's @entity11 balcony before the pet was put down by the authorities ms @entity7 's husband @entity37 ( pictured with their dog ) is being kept in quarantine in @entity11 thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of @entity11 calling on the government 's health minister @entity43 to resign after the pet 's death on october 8			1
ms @entity7 's recovery could prompt further criticism by the protesters , 390,000 of whom signed a petition urging officials to save @entity54 's life			1
although ms @entity7 's recovery would not have changed the odds of @entity20 contracting the disease , protesters had insisted the animal could have been cared for safely in quarantine			1
@entity61 officials took just that tack when they announced they would be saving @entity63 , the spaniel belonging to @entity4 patient @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			0
today ms @entity7 tested negative for the disease , the government said in a statement			1
further tests will be carried out tonight to confirm the result , as patients must be re-tested within 72 hours			1
the nurse cared for @entity2 missionary @entity75 , 69 , who died on september 25 after being infected with @entity4 while he treated patients in @entity77			1
another @entity2 priest , 75 - year - old @entity78 , had died in @entity11 in august after being flown back from missionary work in @entity80			1
anger : there was a mass demonstration in @entity11 when ms @entity7 's pet dog @entity20 was put down thousands of protesters in @entity11 including health workers have called on the health minister to resign protests : one activist 's dog wore a sign which said @entity54 's death could not be forgotten or forgiven ms @entity7 was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from @entity4 sufferers who had survived the disease , and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name			1
one was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir , according to the respected national newspaper @entity103			0
@entity7 is the only known sufferer of @entity4 in @entity2 after the death of the two priests			1
but there are a further 15 people in hospital , including her husband , being kept under observation for signs of the disease			1
photographs of them appearing at a window holding up placards to declare they were in perfect health last week were beamed around the world			0
' i 'm fine ' : one of the 15 others being kept in quarantine showed his temperature from the hospital window protection : health workers at the window of the @entity130 hospital in @entity11 , where 15 people are being held wistful : ms @entity7 's husband , still in quarantine , watches @entity2 's national day celebrations from the window @entity4 has killed at least 4,546 people in @entity80 , @entity77 and @entity138 in the recent outbreak			1
so far only two countries , @entity2 and the @entity61 , have had fresh cases confirmed outside @entity5			0
in both cases they arose after contact with patients who had been flown home for treatment			2
outside the three main countries , there were also 20 fresh cases of @entity4 in @entity151 and one in @entity153 , where the @entity154 said the outbreak has been successfully contained			0
@entity2 has given its permission for the @entity61 to use @entity61 military bases in an operation to send up to 4,000 troops to @entity5 to help contain the disease			2
the bases are at @entity163 near @entity164 and at @entity165 near @entity166 in southern @entity2 , the @entity161 said in a statement on saturday			0
other protests , including by health workers who wore symbolic white masks , have criticised the @entity2 government 's response to the outbreak			2
back to work : @entity175 said he was ' delighted ' to be returning to @entity77 to treat more victims @entity178 nurse @entity177 , who survived @entity4 after being given the experimental drug @entity179 , has flown back to the country where he caught the deadly virus			0
the 29 - year - old said he was ' delighted ' to return to @entity77 's capital @entity185 as he attempts to prevent ' as many unnecessary deaths as possible '			2
there is uncertainty , however , over whether the @entity190 - born nurse is immune to catching @entity4 again			2
although it is widely assumed the same person can not develop the disease twice , the assumption has never been proven by scientists			2
the scale of the current outbreak - with already 16 times more deaths than the previous most fatal outbreak in 1976 - could provide the first test to the theory			0
mr @entity175 will arrive in @entity77 , where 932 people have died of @entity4 , tonight and resume work tomorrow in an isolation unit run at @entity204 by @entity178 medics			0
' i would like to once again thank the team at the @entity208 and the @entity209 who provided me with such excellent treatment and support , ' he said in a statement			0
' but the real emergency is in @entity5 , and the teams out there need all the support we can give them			0
' i am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all i can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible			0
' he became the first confirmed @entity223 to contract @entity4 and was flown home in august to be treated in a specially - adapted unit at the @entity208 in @entity226			0
the nurse will join staff from @entity229 team , a partnership between @entity231 and three @entity234 trusts - @entity232 ’s and @entity235 ’ , @entity236 and @entity226 and @entity237 .			0
