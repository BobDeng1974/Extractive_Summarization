in light of new reports that the @entity4 government used nerve gas against its own citizens , killing at least 213 and as many as 1,300 , president @entity0 is considering military options to respond to an action he previously warned the @entity10 government was crossing a ' red line '			1
@entity13 naval forces are moving closer as the president emphasized that a quick intervention in the @entity4 civil war was problematic , given the international considerations that should precede a military strike			2
the @entity19 said the president would meet saturday with his national security team to consider possible next steps by the @entity13			0
defense secretary @entity41 declined to discuss any specific force movements while saying that @entity0 had asked the @entity43 to prepare military options for @entity4			1
@entity13 defense officials told @entity46 that the @entity47 had sent a fourth warship armed with ballistic missiles into the eastern @entity50 but without immediate orders for any missile launch into @entity4			1
@entity47 ships are capable of a variety of military actions , including launching @entity57 cruise missiles , as they did against @entity58 in 2011 as part of an international action that led to the overthrow of the @entity58 government			2
' @entity64 has a responsibility to provide the president with options for contingencies , and that requires positioning our forces , positioning our assets , to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose , ' @entity63 told reporters traveling with him to @entity78			0
@entity63 said the @entity13 is coordinating with the international community to determine ' what exactly did happen ' near @entity29 earlier this week			0
calling @entity10 a ' thug ' and a ' murderer , ' @entity81 declared , ' history would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator 's use of chemical weapons			2
' ' evidence ' : secretary of state @entity81 said images like these contributed to the @entity13 assessment that chemical weapons were used in @entity4 according to reports , a chemical attack in a suburb of the capital killed at least 100 people			1
it would be the most heinous use of chemical weapons since @entity103 leader @entity102 gassed thousands of @entity104 in the town of @entity106 in 1988			2
@entity63 left little doubt that he thinks the attack in @entity4 involved chemical weapons , although he stressed there is not yet a final answer			1
in discussing the matter , he said , ' it appears to be what happened - use of chemical weapons			2
' the @entity27 disarmament chief , @entity26 , arrived in @entity29 on saturday to press the @entity4 government to allow @entity27 experts to investigate the alleged chemical attacks			1
@entity0 remained cautious about getting involved in a war that has killed more than 100,000 people and now includes @entity123 and @entity124			0
he made no mention of the ' red line ' of chemical weapons use that he marked out for @entity4 president @entity10 a year ago and that @entity13 intelligence says has been breached at least on a small scale several times since			1
' if the @entity13 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity27 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - do we have the coalition to make it work ? ' @entity0 said friday			2
' those are considerations that we have to take into account			0
' @entity0 conceded in an interview on @entity146 's ' @entity145 ' program that the episode is a ' big event of grave concern ' that requires @entity13 attention			0
president @entity0 appeared on @entity146 's ' @entity145 ' on friday to discuss the alleged attack , saying it was a ' big event of grave concern ' that requires @entity13 attention he said any large - scale chemical weapons usage would affect ' core national interests ' of the @entity13 and its allies			1
but nothing he said signaled a shift toward @entity13 action			0
@entity13 defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss ship movements publicly			0
but if the @entity13 wants to send a message to @entity10 , the most likely military action would be a @entity57 missile strike , launched from a ship in the @entity50			1
for a year now , @entity0 has threatened to punish @entity10 's regime if it resorted to its chemical weapons arsenal , among the world 's vastest , saying use or even deployment of such weapons of mass destruction constituted a ' red line ' for him			1
a @entity13 intelligence assessment concluded in june chemical weapons have been used in @entity4 's civil war , but @entity180 has taken no military action against @entity10 's forces			1
@entity13 officials have instead focused on trying to organize a peace conference between the government and opposition			0
@entity0 has authorized weapons deliveries to rebel groups , but none are believed to have been sent so far			0
in his first comments on @entity4 since the alleged chemical attack , @entity0 said the @entity13 is still trying to find out what happened			1
@entity63 said friday that a determination on the chemical attack should be made swiftly because ' there may be another attack coming , ' although he added that ' we do n't know ' whether that will happen			0
after rebels similarly reported chemical attacks in february , @entity13 confirmation took more than four months			0
in this instance , a @entity27 chemical weapons team is already on the ground in @entity4			1
@entity10 's government , then as now , has rejected the claims as baseless			0
@entity0 also cited the need for the @entity13 to be part of a coalition in dealing with @entity4			2
@entity13 's ability by itself to solve the @entity213 country 's sectarian fighting is ' overstated , ' he said .			0

activists report that a nerve gas attack near @entity29 wednesday killed as many as 1,300
president @entity0 is said to be weighing his military options after he warned president @entity10 that chemical weapons use would be crossing a ' red line '
defense secretary @entity41 said the nerve gas attack needs to be verified but that it ' appears to be what happened '
@entity27 representative @entity26 arrived in @entity4 today to ask president @entity10 to let investigators into the country to look into the claim
military officials told the @entity46 that four battleships have been moved within the striking zone of @entity4 and could be used for a @entity57 missile attack
