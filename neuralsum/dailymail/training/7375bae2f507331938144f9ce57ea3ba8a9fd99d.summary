scientists from the @entity12 have found that over 65s who use the social networking website performed better in cognitive tests than those who simply surfed the internet or did n't use it all			1
it 's thought the ever - changing nature of the site - such as the constantly rolling updates - may boost mental acuity			1
adults who used the site performed about 25 per cent better on tasks designed to measure their ability to continuously monitor and to quickly add or delete the contents of their working memory â€“ a function known as ' updating '			1
during the study , 14 adults between 68 and 91 who had either never used the site or used it less than once a month were set up on @entity10			1
they were instructed to make ' friends ' with those in their training group and were asked to post on the site at least once a day			0
a second group were taught to use online diary site , @entity43 , in which entries are kept private , with no social sharing component			2
before the tests , participants completed a series of tests which assessed their levels loneliness and social support , as well as their cognitive abilities			2
the assessments were done again at the end of the study , eight weeks later			0

' [ whereas ] if you 're on @entity10 , several people are posting new things , so new information is constantly getting posted			2
' you 're seeing this new information coming in , and you need to focus on the new information and get rid of the old information , or keep it in mind if you want to go back and reference it later , so you have to constantly update what 's there in your attention			0
' the researchers said they also see @entity10 as a potential alternative to some online games marketed to older people to help boost mental acuity			1
' those games can boring after a while , and this might be a new activity for people to learn that 's more interesting and keeps them socially engaged , ' said @entity100			0

' it 's also important to understand and know about some of the aspects of @entity10 that people have concerns about , like how to keep your profile secure , ' she said			0
' so i would n't suggest to anyone to get out and get @entity115 online right away , unless you or somebody else can provide the proper education and support to that person , so that they can use it in a safe way			0

adults aged 68 - 91 performed 25 per cent better in cognitive tests after being taught how to use @entity10
