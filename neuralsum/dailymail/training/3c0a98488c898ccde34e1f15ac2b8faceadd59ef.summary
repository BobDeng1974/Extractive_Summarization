by @entity1 reporter published : 21:13 est , 12 january 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 13 january 2013 the surgery that allowed @entity3 to once again use his hand was hailed as a landmark moment in @entity7 healthcare			1
but since being given a new lease after @entity7 's first ever hand transplant , a simple thought has been crossing the 51 - year - old 's mind - where his new hand came from			1
the former pub landlord will never know who donated the limb for data protection reasons but as he recovers in @entity19 he said he ' appreciates the gift he has given me '			1
' you think about what the hand has done , where it has been			2
' mr @entity3 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – when it became infected during a severe attack of gout , a condition he had suffered for 20 years			1
he said that every morning his first thought is now ' there 's my new hand ' , describing the feeling as ' such a novelty '			1
in an interview with @entity53 , mr @entity3 described his emotional farewell to his hand , saying ' goodbye ' to it before the landmark operation			1
he described being ' ecstatic ' following the eight - hour procedure as he caught a glimpse of his new fingers , even being able to move them slightly			1
immediate success : mr @entity3 , pictured with @entity24 and surgeon @entity62 , said he wonders who his new hand came from but will never know for data protection reasons mr @entity3 revealed that he will have to take ' anti-rejection drugs ' for the rest of his life to ensure that his body accepts the new hand			1
he also had to undertake psychological evaluations and iq tests before and after the operation			2
one of the things he is most looking forward to is being able to once again shake people 's hand , describing previous scenarios as ' embarrassing '			2
following the operation , mr @entity3 said that his next milestone was to be able to hold his three - year - old grandson ’s hand for the first time			1
after losing the use of his right hand five years ago , he said the implications of his surgery were still sinking in			1
as he continued to marvel at being able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand , he said he hoped to regain his independence and enjoy family life to the full			2
speaking of his grandson @entity90 , he said : ‘ anything i can do will be a bonus			0
holding his hand is going to be great			0
’ ‘ i had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand , ’ he said			1
he and @entity24 , 47 , had to leave their beloved village pub , the @entity101 near @entity102 , and he has been unable to work since			0
‘ it made it virtually impossible to do anything , ’ he said			0
‘ my wife had to help me dress and cut my food up			0
you can imagine without any hands it ’s very difficult			0
and @entity24 spoke of looking forward to holding her husband 's hand for the first time in five years			0
she admitted it will be strange holding a stranger 's hand but is still excited			0
a friend said how so far , for all of @entity90 ’s life , mr @entity3 has had to settle for ‘ just observing ’ the little boy , rather than be able to play with him			2
‘ he ’s the apple of his eye , ’ the friend added			0
mr @entity3 ’s operation became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same procedure			1
while there have been 70 hand transplants world - wide , in those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery			1
the surgeon who carried out the transplant previously praised the donor ’s family for bringing about good from the ‘ awful tragedy of a loved one ’			0
professor @entity62 , who led the complex procedure at @entity139 , said their permission had to be sought soon after their relative ’s sudden death on @entity26			2
there is no tick box for ‘ limbs ’ on donor register forms so next - of - kin must be consulted ‘ individually by the hospital ’			2
the plastic surgeon said : ‘ i really think we have to acknowledge the circumstances that this hand was given , at @entity26 , at a time of enormous tragedy and loss			1
i would like to acknowledge the extraordinary gift			0
‘ organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one			0
’ it is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke			0
professor @entity171 said it could be 18 months before the operation is considered a success			0
‘ if all goes well , i would hope he has quite strong grasp , and have good sensibility , a good ability to feel , and he ’ll have a precision pinch , ’ he said			0
@entity181 : consultant plastic surgeon and professor of hand surgery , @entity62 , began investigating the possibility of carrying out the @entity7 's first hand transplant ten years ago			2

@entity3 , 51 , suffered gout and *developed* infection , causing paralysis
on @entity26 became first person to have the eight - hour landmark surgery
he will never find out who the donor is *due* for data protection reasons
but he thanked the man for the ' gift ' which he said still felt like a ' novelty '
revealed he and his wife are getting psychological help so they do n't reject the hand
