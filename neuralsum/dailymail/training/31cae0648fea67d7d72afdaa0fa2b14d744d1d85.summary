the best tasting ring doughnuts are said to be those straight from the fryer with just the right level of softness , a crispy crust and a light dusting of sugar			1
and now a mathematician has established the formulae needed to create these perfect doughnuts every time			2
dr @entity11 found that a ring doughnut with a 0.4 - inch ( 11mm ) hole has the best ‘ squidgy to crispy ’ ratio of 3.5 to 1 - and 5.8g of sugar is needed to add the right amount of taste			1
to get the optimum level of softness to crispness , a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4 - inches ( 11mm )			1
this gives it a ' squidge to crisp ' ratio of 3.5 to 1			2
its diameter should be between 2.8 - inches and 3.2 - inches ( 72mm and 82mm ) , and then a total of 5.8g of sugar is needed to evenly coat the doughnut ‘ the doughnut , aka torus , is an important mathematical object , as well as being delicious , ’ explained dr @entity11 , a senior lecturer of @entity32 at @entity33			1
commissioned by @entity37 , dr @entity11 devised formulas to find the volume and surface area of doughnuts , the sugar to doughnut ratio , the mass of sugar and the ‘ squidge to crisp ratio			1
’ the optimum ' squidge to crisp ' ratio of a ring doughnut formula is pictured to get the tastiest level of softness to crispness , a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4 - inches ( 11mm )			1
this is a ' squidge to crisp ' ratio of 3.5 to 1			0
its diameter should be between 2.8 - inches and 3.2 - inches ( 72mm and 82mm )			0
a total of 5.8g of sugar is then needed to evenly coat the doughnut			1
all being equal , the bigger the hole , the crispier the crust and the smaller the hole , the softer the inside			2
while the sugar to doughnut ratio was established as two over r. dr @entity11 identified the ‘ squidge to crisp ratio ’ , confirms that , all else being equal , the bigger the hole , the crispier the crust			1
while the smaller the hole , the softer the inside			2
to get the tastiest level of softness to crispness , a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4 - inches ( 11mm )			1
this gives it a ratio of 3.5 to 1			0
its diameter should be between 2.8 - inches and 3.2 - inches ( 72mm and 82mm )			0
‘ this relatively small hole means that the doughnuts are 78 per cent squidge and 22 per cent crisp , ’ explained dr @entity11			1
‘ you imagine that as the doughnut grows , it has to keep adding on an infinitely thin surface area amount of doughnut , like putting on extra layers of clothing			0
‘ of course , there ’s no such thing as an infinitely thin layer of doughnut around the outside - in reality it has some thickness			0
' this is the crispy part around the outside			0
’ she took the overall volume of the doughnut and then subtracted the volume of the soft part on the inside , which is itself in the shape of a doughnut			0
the radius of the doughnut is denoted by @entity110 , measured from the centre of the hole to the middle of the dough			0
while the smaller radius of the dough inside is shown as ' r ' , measuring the thickness of the dough			0
starting with a circle of 5g of caster sugar , dr @entity11 found it covered a radius of 70mm			2
she then worked out the mass of sugar needed to cover an average doughnut with an r of 30mm and a r of 15mm , before using the ratio to determine 5.8g of sugar is need to evenly coat the @entity37 's doughnut			1
the radius of the doughnut ( pictured ) is denoted by @entity110 , measured from the centre of the hole to the middle of the dough			0
while the smaller radius of the dough inside is shown as r , measuring the thickness of the dough dr. @entity11 's formulas for the volume of doughnut , surface area , sugar to doughnut ratio , the mass of sugar needed for the doughnut and the ' squidge to crisp ratio ' are pictured the sugar to doughnut ratio was established as two over r. ‘ admittedly if we fix the volume of dough , the amount of sugar we get is proportional to the square root of the size of the hole			1
’ but dr @entity11 concluded : ‘ it ’s easy to get carried away messing around with calculus			1
‘ go ahead and eat your doughnuts however you like them			0
’ dr @entity11 recently calculated ( pictured ) while smaller pizzas have more topping per bite , there is a larger risk of the pizza having a soggy bottom dr @entity11 recently calculated that in relative terms , the average bite taken from an 11 - inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14 - inch pizza			1
her formula also reveals that while smaller pizzas have more topping per bite , for home cooks seeking lots of extras on their creations , there is a larger risk of their pizza having a soggy bottom			0
she created another formula , alpha , divided by the radius of a pizza , squared to work crust sizes for pizzas of different diameters			0
she explains the size of the pizza 's crust is proportional to the thickness of the pizza - the larger the pizza , the thinner the base , so the smaller the crust			0
dr. @entity11 has found that the secret lies in proportions of the 14 inch pizza as it cooks just as evenly as the smaller version but the topping is spread over a larger area and goes close to the edge of the pizza			2
however , technically , pizza lovers in search of the most topping per bite should opt for the 11 - inch classic version , based on the research .			2

@entity212 dr @entity11 used calculus to study ring doughnuts
she found that the perfect doughnut has an 0.4 - inch ( 11mm ) hole
this gives it an optimum ‘ squidgy to crispy ’ ratio of 3.5 to 1
a total of 5.8g of sugar is then needed to evenly coat the doughnut
the bigger the hole , the crispier the crust and the smaller the hole , the softer the inside
