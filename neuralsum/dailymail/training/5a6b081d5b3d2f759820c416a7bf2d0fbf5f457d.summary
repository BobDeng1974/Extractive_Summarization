@entity0 has sympathy with officials and believes players throughout the @entity4 - and not just at @entity5 - must take it upon themselves to stamp out the ' disease ' of simulation			1
the issue reared its ugly head once more when @entity10 said @entity5 were subject of a sustained campaign following @entity13 ' yellow card for diving at @entity15 on sunday			1
@entity0 , who made a club record 795 appearances for @entity5 and was nicknamed ' chopper ' for his no - nonsense style , thinks @entity13 and @entity10 were right to feel aggrieved after the midfielder was booked following a tackle from @entity22			1
@entity5 midfielder @entity13 smiles in disbelief after being booked for a dive against @entity15 @entity25 star @entity13 appeared to be caught by @entity15 ' young defender @entity22 at @entity26 's on sunday @entity0 said : ' you 've only got to look at the young lad that made the tackle - i 'm sure he was relieved the referee did n't give a penalty			1
' it 's a very difficult job refereeing today			0
it 's easy to sit there in the tv studio and say ' he 's got this decision wrong '			0
' everybody makes mistakes , but they 're being highlighted at the moment			0
' players , in every level of football , seem to go down very easily nowadays compared to what they used to			0
@entity0 , pictured tackling @entity47 in 1971 , was well known for his uncompromising style on the pitch @entity5 legend @entity0 believes diving has become a disease on the @entity53 game in recent years ' for the last three or four years there 's been a disease in football where people fall very easily			1
' the only people that will stop it are the players themselves			0
' @entity0 is also infuriated by the set - piece grappling which takes place in the penalty areas			2
if referees use the rules at their disposal - like when @entity68 's @entity67 was penalised by @entity69 for hauling down @entity70 of @entity71 in october - @entity0 believes the practice will be outlawed			2
' that 's the only way they will stop it , ' @entity0 said .			0

@entity5 's @entity13 was booked for diving against @entity15
but the midfielder appeared to be caught and did *deserve* a penalty
@entity0 has sympathy for referees as ' people fall very easily '
