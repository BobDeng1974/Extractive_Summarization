by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 05:53 est , 19 april 2013 mind of memories : @entity3 digs up what is long forgotten in her new documentary what are your earliest memories ? actor sir @entity10 remembers waving to his mother from the back of an ambulance as he was taken to hospital with diphtheria — ‘ or was she waving to me ? ’ he wondered			1
comedian @entity17 has a clear recollection of dancing with her father , with her toes perched on his feet , and sir @entity22 remembers being chased around a christmas tree by a man wearing a @entity26 costume — just the sort of surreal incident to make a playwright of a small child			2
most intriguing of all , these memories all date from around the same age : three years old			2
as @entity3 discovered in if memory serves me right , the human brain does n’t store anything permanent from the baby and toddler years			1
even nursery children ca n’t remember anything before their third birthday			2
@entity3 , 66 , made a delightful presenter , full of laughs and dry asides			1
the documentary was shot through with a vein of tragedy — she lost her husband , scriptwriter @entity49 , ten years ago , a loss that still brings her close to tears when she talks of it			1
and her interest in memory was sparked by the pain of watching her father @entity56 succumb to dementia			1
‘ he lost so much more than his memory , ’ she said			1
‘ he lost his essence and i lost the father i knew			2
’ but it was all far from doleful			2
@entity3 threw herself into research : she underwent an mri scan , analysing which parts of her cortex — the outer layer of her brain — lit up when she focused on recent memories or old ones			1
she even examined cross-sections of two real human brains : one was healthy , and looked like compressed tripe , and the other was from a patient with @entity76 ’s , and looked like a @entity78 cheese			1
she experimented with false memories , asking hypnotist @entity80 to convince her that her dog had won @entity82 ( and that @entity83 had presented her with the prize )			0
the climactic segment was a bit of a let - down : @entity3 embarked on a pointless challenge to remember the names and birthdays of 25 people she had never met			1
the rest of the programme had shown that memory is about so much more than parlour tricks			2
remembering : @entity3 and her former classmates at @entity99 for documentary if my memory serves me right it was disappointing , because otherwise the show had taken an innovative approach to science			1
instead of being academic and geeky , @entity3 infused the topic with human warmth that gave her discoveries relevance and meaning			1
i ’d like to see more of this approach , putting science in a personal context			0
the right presenter can transmute a leaden concept into tv gold - dust			0
@entity114 was an inspired choice for a trawl through the telly archives on @entity119 ’s new comedy compilation , @entity120			0
this format should n’t have worked : the opening episode was a collection of clips from news magazines and children ’s shows about @entity129 ’s tunnels			0
in fact , it ought to have been deathly dull : there were features on pot - holing , on the sewers network , on the digging of the @entity137 and on various abandoned efforts to construct a @entity139			0
but if you ’ve got half an hour to spare on @entity141 , treat yourself , because the show was snortingly funny from start to finish			0
do n’t try to eat or drink while you watch — you ’ll end up with hiccups			0
from @entity147 wriggling through @entity149 tunnels in his underpants , to @entity151 surveying the @entity152 through a telescope like a holidaymaker on the @entity156 promenade , these clips were a joy			0
sometimes it was the characters who were beyond parody , like the council worker sent into the sewers to hunt for @entity165 dentures : apparently it was n’t uncommon in the @entity167 for people to lose their teeth down the toilet after a party , presumably during the course of throwing up			0
in other clips , the voice - overs raised the laughs , like the plummy @entity177 announcer in awe of the navvies digging the @entity180 : ‘ men with iron in their muscles and buttocks , sons of @entity187 almost all of them			0
’ marvellously silly stuff .			0
