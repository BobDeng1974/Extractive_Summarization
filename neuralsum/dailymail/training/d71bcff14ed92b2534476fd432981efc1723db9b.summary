however , if you wanted to achieve a more defined look , use a moulding cream to smooth the hair down from the top of the hair to the bottom , working the cream in the same direction as the hair growth the @entity110 - get yourself a strong moustache wax with an admirably manly scent to ensure your @entity69 stays in shape			1
work the wax into the end of the hair and twist the hair away from your face to create the thin curly shape the one two - you need a good trimmer to achieve the intricacies of this look			0

use your trimmer to thin out your @entity69 to keep the hairs to a light lip dusting			0
use your trimmer to achieve an even thin trim – i recommend a grade 3 clipper attachment			0
it 's important to keep the lip clear , the lip should be totally visible and the moustache hair no longer than 0.5cm			0
this is also the best style for those who ca n't quite grow enough facial hair for a full on tache ( if you want achieve these looks but ca n't achieve them yourself , pop down to @entity86 's pop - up @entity152 on 7 @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 anytime throughout @entity1 for a free @entity69 shave			1
