by @entity0 published : 12:37 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 7 october 2013 overdose : @entity2 , pictured , was found dead with a huge amount of painkillers in her system the death of a @entity8 lawyer who died from a huge overdose of painkillers has been left a mystery after an inquest failed to reach a conclusion			1
@entity2 , 32 , was found dead on 28 june 2012 with a cocktail of drugs in her system , which exceeded recommended levels more than 100 times			1
she had moved to @entity18 in @entity19 to live with her fiancé , lecturer @entity20 , and was found by friends in the house they shared			1
the inquest , held in @entity24 , heard that mr @entity20 was a controlling partner , but that he was away at the time she died			1
as well as the drugs in her system , it was found that miss @entity2 had also eaten a heavily - spiced stew shortly before she died			1
there was a suggestion that the tablets could have been ground up and added to her meal , but the coroner decided there was not enough evidence to justify a verdict of unlawful killing			1
miss @entity2 had met mr @entity20 , a 42 - year - old who taught @entity40 at @entity41 , while he was on holiday in @entity43 in marh 2011			1
the two fell in love and moved back to mr @entity20 's home in @entity40 just under a year later			2
they got engaged and miss @entity2 became pregnant around the time of the move			1
the inquest heard from friends of miss @entity2 that she was a healthy and upbeat person who usually avoided taking any sort of medicine			1
it was also said that mr @entity20 was a ' control freak ' who followed miss @entity2 's every move , and also that she allegedly confided to friends that she thought he might be trying to kill her with drugs			1
@entity2 ’s semi-naked body was found on a bed in the three - bedroom bungalow next to a packed suitcase by family friends @entity64 and @entity65			2
prescription drugs , which mr @entity20 had taken for his whole adult life , were found all over the house			2
the inquest heard that mr @entity20 was in @entity70 on a course at the time the body was found			2
toxicologist dr @entity73 said he could not say definitively that the tablets were taken at the same time as the stew miss @entity2 had eaten , but that it was possible they had been ground up			1
he said the concentrations of codeine , tramadol and cyclizine alone could have killed her but in combination they were ' very likely ' to have caused her death			0
the inquest opened in december 2012 , but was adjourned so that police could make further enquiries			2
in the wake of @entity2 's death , mr @entity20 moved back to @entity43 , but fell ill there and collapsed in the street			1
he has since returned and is in a hospital neurology unit in a ' very poorly state ' with ' physical and neurological difficulties ' and was unable to evidence at today 's inquest			1
fiancé : @entity20 , pictured , was in @entity70 when miss @entity2 's body was found speaking at an earlier hearing in december , mrs @entity94 , 47 , told the inquest : ' @entity2 told me @entity20 kept telling her to take the tablets and she said “ he ’s trying to kill me			1
” at the resumed hearing today , she added : ' she was looking forward to her pregnancy and she refused even to take paracetamol for a headache			0
her attitude was not to take tablets when you are pregnant			0
' she was close to her mum			0
i ca n’t think she would take her own life and do that to her mum			0
' she also said that miss @entity2 had been complaining about her fiancé 's drinking			1
mr @entity65 , 56 , said : ' @entity112 was taking paracetamol and she felt @entity20 was trying to kill her			2
she told me " @entity20 is trying to kill me			2
he ’s trying to make me take drugs			0
" he said mr @entity20 followed her everywhere - even to the toilet - and compared the treatment to domestic abuse			2
mrs @entity94 said at the resumed hearing that @entity2 had complained to her about mr @entity20 ’s drinking and that he used her as a taxi service			1
miss @entity2 's brother @entity121 , 42 , told the inquest : ' she was always positive and buzzing			1
in the week before she died she was going on and on to mother that she had a big headache			0
' i was told it was due to her pregnancy and would pass			0
' she was as fit as a fiddle and never smoked or drank and was scared of medication			0
she did n’t like it at all			0
you had to tie her down to give her anything			0
' he claimed mr @entity20 was a ' control freak ' and wanted to know @entity135 ’s every movement - but that she seemed happy and had no problems			2
mr @entity20 said in a statement she was not enjoying her pregnancy and could not go to the gym which she enjoyed			2
she was reluctant to take any medication during her pregnancy ' she was fearful of harming the baby , ' he said			0
new life : ms @entity2 moved to the village of @entity144 ( pictured ) , @entity19 , to live with mr @entity20 whom she met in @entity43			1
@entity146 dr @entity145 said miss @entity2 had died within two to four hours of taking the tablets which he thought may have been ground up			1
det sgt @entity148 , who led the police inquiry told the inquest : ' i ’m unable to say beyond any reasonable doubt that he had anything to do with her death			0
he was in @entity70 at the time			0
' coroner @entity155 recorded an open verdict saying she had considered unlawful killing but there was not enough proof			1
det sgt @entity159 said : ' the question remains , how did high levels of medication get into @entity2 ’s body ? ' he told the hearing that two previous partners of mr @entity20 both described him as ' unusual ' , controlling and dishonest at times			1
holiday romance : ms @entity2 met @entity167 on @entity43 , pictured , while he was on holiday he once sprayed a substance in the mouth of his then partner which left her sick on a plane after she complained of a migraine and he injected another partner in the leg with a pain killer when she too said she had a headache			0
det sgt @entity148 said he would have liked to have talked to mr @entity181 to have ' clarified certain points ' but added : ' there was no evidence to suggest he would want to wish any harm to @entity112			0
' ms @entity155 said she had discounted @entity112 accidentally taking too many tablets and she did not believe it was a deliberate act			0
of unlawful killing she said : ' it has not been possible for the reasons told to me by det sgt @entity148 for him to complete the investigations			2
' it is unlikely that he is going to be able to interview potential key witnesses to shed more light on what might have happened			0
' becauase it is such a high burden of proof i need to have more evidence			0
' after the hearing @entity202 said : ' i do n’t understand really			0

' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
