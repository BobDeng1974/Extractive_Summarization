a group of people traveling in @entity2 have captured a video they described as ' the sight of a lifetime '			1
inside a taxi journeying from @entity8 to @entity9 in northwest @entity2 , the group happened to stumble across a herd of bison			1
however as the car got closer , they realized at least three wolves were trying to take down the herd			1
fortunately for the buffalo , the wolves were scared off by the cab , and scattered into the nearby woods			1
i do n't know when we 'll ever see that again			0
' the video was posted to @entity43 by user @entity44 , believed to be the person filming			0
the person then thanks the driver for slowing down			0
' no problem , ' he says			0
' it 's good to see			0
' safe : the herd were able to continue with their journey once the wolves fled heading for the hills : as a truck approaches , the herd move off into the woods adding to the footage is the fact that sunlight breaks right after the herd is rescued			2
the light quickly switches from blue to an orange hue			0
it 's not uncommon for people to take a taxi between @entity9 and @entity8 â€” a distance of about 315 kilometers			1
