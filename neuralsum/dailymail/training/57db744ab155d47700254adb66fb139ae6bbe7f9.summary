by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 09:18 est , 18 november 2013 the oldest known stone - tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years			1
this could make homo sapiens much older than previously believed , according to some scientists			1
another possibility , being proposed by the researchers , is that an earlier species to ours was capable of making sophisticated hunting tools			1

this image shows a sample of @entity17 pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown the research centres on 280,000 year - old stone - tipped spears recently found at an @entity26 @entity25 site known as @entity17			1
the @entity27 in the @entity28 was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its @entity30 archaeological sites			0
scientists the @entity32 at @entity32 ’s @entity33 were recently able to study the spears and determine their age			0
the research centres on 280,000 year - old stone - tipped spears recently found at an @entity26 @entity25 site known as @entity17			1
the @entity27 in the @entity28 was discovered in the 1970s and is best known for its @entity30 archaeological sites writing in the journal @entity40 , they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength			2
‘ [ this ] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous , complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of @entity7 , ’ said the authors of the study			0
researchers believe the direct ancestor of @entity7 in @entity55 , and @entity56 in @entity57 and @entity58 , is the @entity59 , also known as @entity59			1
pictured is a skull of a @entity59 , dated at 400,000 years ago and considered to be amongst the most complete fossil skulls ever found			2
previous evidence shows that @entity59 was an accomplished tool - maker and skillfully butchered large animals previous evidence shows that @entity59 was an accomplished tool - maker and skillfully butchered large animals			2
however , the stone - tipped spears could provide a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills			1
the study also suggests that , because there were more individuals around in @entity17 during this period , there would have been a greater chance for the spread of innovative ideas			0
a mixture of animal remains were found at the site by researchers have been unable to prize them apart to understand which animals were hunted			0
they do however know the spears were thrown from a distance at prey , instead of thrust into victims , allowing them to hunt buffalo and other game from a safer distance			0
there has been much debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to use stone - tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago			1
a separate study done in may by @entity103 , of @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , professor @entity103 shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the @entity30 in @entity55 and attached them to wooden shafts			0
together with a group of @entity113 students , @entity103 ran 15 experiments , throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses			0
the results showed ' quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks , ' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds , from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures			0
these findings prompted @entity103 and the @entity113 's @entity130 to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from @entity135 in @entity55			0
two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier , between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them , at the time , the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons .			2

280,000 year - old stone - tipped spears were found at @entity17 in @entity26
scientists believe they could have been created by homo *heidelbergensis*
also known as @entity59 , they were species before @entity7
another possibility is that @entity7 made the weapons , making our species much older than previously believed
