more deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles , ' @entity18 wrote in a statement , according to the @entity24			1
' i can only wish the @entity25 - and hope that they will go forth to be better advocates for free expression and free thought than their @entity29			0
' i assumed that @entity8 intended to honor me for my work as a defender of the rights of women against abuses that are often religious in origin , ' she wrote			0
' for over a decade , i have spoken out against such practices as female genital mutilation , so - called “ honor killings ” and applications of @entity51 that justify such forms of domestic abuse as wife beating or child beating			1
part of my work has been to question the role of @entity1 in legitimizing such abhorrent practices			2
