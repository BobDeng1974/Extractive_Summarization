@entity0 never won against @entity1 as a player			1
his record of one draw and two defeats at @entity6 and @entity7 included a 4 - 0 beating at @entity9 in 1998 that secured the @entity12 ’s first @entity11 title			1
‘ one of the worst matches of my career , ’ he says with a grimace			0
‘ @entity18 put me in midfield , it was only the second time i ’d played there and @entity21 and @entity22 were on to me every time , “ @entity23 ! ” ‘ after six minutes @entity24 cuffed me on the back of my neck and i scored an own goal			0
we never had a chance after that			0
’ in demand : @entity32 boss @entity0 says he has been offered seven management jobs in @entity34 bad memories : @entity0 scored an own goal against @entity37 as a player that handed the @entity40 the titl on tuesday night , 76,000 partisan @entity32 fans will be screaming for their manager to gain his revenge in @entity46 ’s @entity45 , where @entity47 memorably won the @entity48 in 2005			1
a lucrative @entity48 spot is up for grabs and @entity0 , now sporting a rugged beard , is up for the fight			1
‘ @entity37 were the last team we wanted , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’ve watched @entity1 ’s teams for nearly 20 years and they are always quick , lively and play football			0
‘ but it ’s not my philosophy to think we have nothing to lose because they are the favourites			0
* * * * that			0
i am also under pressure as manager of a massive club			0
‘ they say @entity32 have 15 million fans in @entity67 , and they expect			0
our fans stop and tell me : “ @entity37 finished ”			1
we are as close to them to qualifying for the @entity48			1
’ fighting talk : the @entity73 is confident his @entity32 team can cause an upset in @entity46 on tuesday night @entity0 has experience at overturning the odds			1
he famously led his @entity80 team to a 3 - 2 win at rainy @entity82 in 2007 , a result that cost @entity34 a place at @entity85 and brolly - clutching @entity34 manager @entity86 his job			1
‘ @entity34 were favourites that night , they needed the result and had 80,000 fans at home			1
‘ but we know underdogs can win in football			0
if we beat @entity37 , it would n’t be a miracle that would get shown on @entity94 , ’ he says			1
@entity95 with a brolly : @entity0 was responsible for stopping @entity34 from getting to @entity85 the last few years have seen @entity0 enjoy both success and a hard - luck story or two			1
he was seconds away from the semi-final of @entity85 until a late @entity67 equaliser			0
he qualified for @entity101 but drew @entity102 and @entity103 in the group stage			0
his first club job with @entity106 in @entity107 ended in the sack			0
his reputation in @entity34 has always remained high			1
asked directly if he has ever been approached to manage here , he replies quietly : ‘ seven times			2
’ he will not name the clubs but is regularly linked with a return to @entity6 , where he was a popular player and forged friendships with @entity115 and @entity116 that still exist today			1
there is no doubt he is a confirmed anglophile			0
‘ i am really connected to @entity34 , i lived a very important part of my life there and i feel they like me there , ’ he says			2
‘ i love the @entity126 attitude to football			1
we played a pre-season friendly this summer against @entity130 and they showed an unbelievable spirit			0
’ he added : ‘ if you asked me which country i ’d want to work in next , there is a big gap between @entity34 and the rest of the countries			2
but that is for the future , not now			0
@entity46 suits me as a city			2
’ victory against @entity37 would propel the 45 - year - old @entity0 back among the a-list of wanted managers			1
he has identified @entity145 and @entity146 as his major obstacles			1
‘ @entity37 were good last year but i never felt they were going to win the title because something was missing : the top quality , the leaders			2
‘ but when i heard during the @entity152 they were signing @entity145 , i thought “ perfect for @entity37 ”			1
’ he added : ‘ mentally , @entity37 should be ready to challenge for the title after winning the @entity158 but for me the likes of @entity153 are still first			2
they can play football or fight , @entity153 can do whatever			0
they can park the bus , or can force the other team to park the bus			0
’ danger man : the @entity32 coach says @entity145 is exactly the kind of player that can thrive at @entity37 @entity146 fan : @entity0 thinks @entity146 , centre , is @entity37 's best and most important player he is a huge fan of @entity146			1
‘ he is @entity37 ’s best player			1
there is a lot more fuss on a daily basis about @entity173 but so far on the pitch , it ’s @entity146 , ’ he said			2
‘ most top players have one quality that stands out			0
you ca n’t tell with @entity146 , he is not that quick , he is not @entity178 for his football brain , or @entity180 for his fight			1
but he is nine out of 10 in everything			0
‘ but overall i ’d say the @entity37 team i played against was more @entity184 than this one			2
but most clubs are losing that kind of identity now , not just in @entity34			2
’ cheap deal : @entity32 signed one - time @entity37 target @entity189 , left , from @entity153 this summer instant impact : the @entity193 forward scored a hat - trick in the last qualification round against @entity196 there is a financial chasm between the two clubs			2
while @entity37 splashed out £ 35million on @entity145 , @entity32 signed @entity189 from @entity153 for less than one - seventh of the price			1
interest in @entity204 ’s @entity203 player @entity202 has so far stalled because @entity32 ca n’t afford the £ 5m asking price			0
@entity189 , who nearly joined @entity37 a year ago , scored a hat - trick in the previous round against @entity196 and will be the @entity67 club ’s main threat			2
@entity210 : in 2007 @entity1 said @entity67 clubs were not good enough for latter stages of @entity48 @entity0 dismisses however the idea @entity37 will be cowed by the atmosphere in @entity46			1
‘ they went to @entity215 last year and won 3 - 0 with a cigar , ’ he said			0
‘ the reputation of @entity67 fans is prejudiced			0
hostile and intimidating ? yes			0
do they want to eat you ? no. ’ even so , @entity1 might get some special stick from fans with long memories			0
the @entity37 manager stirred the pot after @entity47 beat @entity32 8 - 0 in 2007 by suggesting @entity67 clubs were n’t good enough to be allowed into the latter stages of the @entity48			1
caring approach : while in charge of @entity80 , @entity0 gave @entity228 , right , money for coffee on away trips @entity0 ’s warmth towards his players is his personal trademark			1
in his first job as @entity80 youth coach , he once gave pocket money to a young @entity228 and @entity238 because they had no spending money , not even for a cup of coffee , on away trips			2
he may be the boss , but he ’s also their friend			0
that might be the biggest threat of all to @entity1 come tuesday night .			0

the first leg of the @entity48 qualifier is on tuesday in @entity46
@entity0 picked out @entity146 and @entity145 as @entity37 's key men
he never won against @entity37 as a player while at @entity6 or @entity7
he was in charge of @entity80 when they beat @entity34 at @entity82 in 2007
the former @entity80 boss says he has been approached to manage in @entity34 on seven *occasions* and that he loves @entity126 attitude to football
