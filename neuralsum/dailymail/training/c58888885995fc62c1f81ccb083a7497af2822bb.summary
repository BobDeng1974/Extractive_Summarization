' oh , do stop complaining dear ' : men can tolerate more pain than women , according to new research it is a debate that can prove rather agonising for everyone involved			1
men have long claimed that their pain threshold is higher than women ’s , while women cite childbirth as proof the opposite is true			1
now , however , scientists claim to have found the answer once and for all			0
it seems men can tolerate more pain than women and are less likely to let on that they are suffering because they want to appear macho			2
according to researchers from @entity22 , gender stereotypes mean men tend to act stoically when they are hurt , whereas women show more sensitivity			2
pain scientist dr @entity26 , who recruited 200 @entity28 and @entity29 volunteers for the study , said : ‘ traditionally , high levels of stoicism are associated with men and high levels of sensitivity are associated with women			1
some ethnic groups are described as more stoic , while others are viewed as more free in expressing their pain behaviour			0
we did not detect differences in pain unpleasantness			0
’ dr @entity26 monitored sensitivity , endurance and willingness to report pain , and found that men had higher pain thresholds and reported less pain intensity than women , irrespective of their nationality			1
the @entity28 volunteers could not endure as much pain as @entity29 participants but were more willing to report it			1
however , reactions based on gender stereotypes were more pronounced in @entity29 than the @entity28 , suggesting gender and culture both play a part in how we cope with discomfort			1
those who took part in the two - year study , published in the @entity67 , were put through two pain - inducing procedures			2
in one , they were jabbed in the hand with a 1cm - wide blunt tip , while in the other , they had to hold their hand above their head while a cuff was applied to restrict blood flow			0
however , according to another study , making them sit a maths test could have been just as effective			0
researchers at the @entity82 have found that ‘ maths anxiety ’ – where someone is scared of maths regardless of their ability – can cause physical pain			0
the study discovered that those who experience the highest levels of anxiety at the mere anticipation of a maths test also show increased activity in regions of the brain linked with pain sensation			2
and the higher the anxiety , the higher the neural activity detected , journal @entity97 reported .			0

study tested 200 @entity28 and @entity29 volunteers
men of either nationality had higher pain thresholds
@entity29 generally less sensitive than @entity28
