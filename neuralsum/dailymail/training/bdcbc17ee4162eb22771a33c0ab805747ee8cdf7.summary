a stressful job and lifestyle could damage a person 's short - term memory in old age , scientists have warned			1
a study at the @entity7 has found a potential link between a hormone and short - term memory loss in older people			1
it revealed that having high levels in cortisol - a natural hormone in the body , which increases when a person is stressed - can lead to memory lapses as a person ages			2
high levels of the stress hormone cortisol can increase the risk of short - term memory loss in old age , researchers have warned short - term increases in cortisol levels are vital for survival			1
the hormone allows a person to cope , helping the body to respond to life 's challenges by making it more alert and allowing a person to think on their feet			0
but abnormally high or prolonged spikes in cortisol , which can happen when a person is dealing with long - term stressful situations , can lead to digestion problems , anxiety , weight gain and high blood pressure , studies have shown			0
@entity46 , an assistant psychology professor at the @entity7 , said : ' stress hormones are one mechanism that we believe leads to weathering of the brain			1
' like a rock on the shoreline , after years and years it will eventually break down and disappear			0
' scientists linked the raised levels of cortisol to the gradual loss of synapses in the prefrontal cortex , the region of the brain that houses short - term memory			2
synapses are the connections that help the brain process , store and recall information			0
as a person ages , repeated and long - term exposure to cortisol , can cause synapses to shrink and disappear			0
while previous research has shown cortisol produces similar affects in other regions of the ageing brain , this is the first study to examine its impact on the prefrontal cortex , the university said			0
researchers discovered prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone affected the prefrontal cortex of the brain , which is responsible for short - term memory although the results are preliminary findings , scientists said they could provide the basis for research into how short - memory decline in ageing adults could be slowed or prevented			1
the study , published in the @entity96 , could also raise the possibility of finding treatments that reduce cortisol levels in susceptible individuals			0
it could mean treating people who have naturally high levels of cortisol , including those who are depressed , or those who experience repeated , long - term stress due to traumatic life events , such as the death of a loved one			2
the study found short - term memory lapses linked to high levels of cortisol begin to affect a person around the age of 65			1
but researchers warned that it is important to remember that stress hormones are only one of a host of factors which affect mental decline and memory loss as a person ages .			2

study at the @entity7 found link between high levels of stress hormone cortisol and lapses in short - term memory in old age
researchers said findings could form basis for treatment of memory loss
psychology professor @entity46 said : ' stress hormones are one mechanism that we believe leads to weathering of the brain '
study found loss of short - term memory first appears around the age of 65
