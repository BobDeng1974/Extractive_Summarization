by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 1 october 2013 students experiencing bizarre symptoms including bleached hair and the loss of body hair led to the closure of a @entity9 high school ’s swimming pool last week			1
@entity10 closed the pool wednesday after students complained of ailments ranging from burning eyes and itching skin to bleached and missing hair			1
the school blamed the symptoms on a ph imbalance caused by a faulty @entity19 tank			2
water polo coach @entity22 , in a letter to parents , explained the pool ’s ph level was much higher than normal and that a new @entity19 tank had been ordered , according to reports			2
missing and bleaching hair : @entity10 's pool ( similar to the one pictured here ) was closed after students began seeing body hair fall out and the hair on their heads bleaching the pool ’s ph level was 8.4 , but should reside in a range of 7.2 to 8.0 , according to a city inspection report cited by the @entity37			1
low chlorine levels and the defective @entity19 tank combined to bring the ph level to an abnormal level , mr @entity22 ’s letter explained			0
a ph level of 8.4 is 10 times the allowable limit , the letter noted			0
the @entity47 of @entity48 made the decision to shut the pool out of concern for student health , the school is testing the water three times daily , reported @entity55			0
‘ the ph scale is an exponential scale , so 8.5 is very high ( 10x ) , and the level of rapid eye and skin irritation due to chloramines rises significantly at levels above 0.6 , ’ wrote mr @entity22 , according to @entity55			2
‘ the high ph was caused by a defective @entity19 tank , co2 being the gas that buffers ( lowers ) the @entity70 , ’ the letter continued			1
though a new @entity19 tank has reportedly been ordered by the school , parents still expressed concern over their children losing body hair , among other complaints			1
‘ if those statements are true , it does raise concern , ’ @entity78 , president of the @entity79 , told the @entity80			0
‘ it speaks to student safety			0
we need to help ensure that students are safe , whether they are walking down a hall or in a pool			0
’ ph imbalance : school officials blamed high ph levels on the students ' discomfort another parent was also alarmed by their child ’s ‘ non-existent ’ body hair , stinging eyes and the hair on his head turning white , said @entity55			1
we did n’t want the pool closed , we do n’t want to make a political issue out of it			2
we want a safe and healthy environment for our children , ’ said the parent , declining to be named			0
‘ we did n’t want the school administration to wait until there was a crisis to deal with this issue , ’ the parent added			0
the replacement tank , which costs $ 7,000 , is expected arrive within seven days , both papers reported			0
the school is currently using a liquid buffer to restore ph levels to the acceptable range , the @entity37 noted			1
increased diligence : the school pledged to test the water three times a day , as well as have an independent tester conduct monthly evaluations despite the curious bleaching and falling out of students ’ hair , a city spokesperson told the @entity37 the closure of a pool is not unusual , and can happen for a myriad of reasons			1
the school has pledged to test the pool water three times a day going forward , and will soon contract an independent tester to conduct monthly water evaluations , instead of the annual testing previously done , according to the @entity37			0
the pool has twice been closed in the past , according to the @entity37 , including two years ago for similar complaints – also due to a high ph level .			1
