@entity8 along with his sister @entity21 vowed to sell the fine - wine at massive profits after three years in ‘ premium storage ’			1
the firm raked in £ 2.5million by offering thousands of bottles but then closed the business the firm , @entity26 , raked in £ 2.5 million by offering thousands of bottles - but pulled the plug on the business before investors could retrieve their cash			1
@entity8 then reinvested the money in a second con , @entity34 , selling cheap @entity36 wine at events such as the @entity38			1
they raked in an average of £ 5,000 from investors - many of them elderly - and even persuaded some to buy 10,000 bottles a time			1
in fact only a fraction of the wine was ever produced			2
@entity16 was jailed for three years at @entity46 today @entity8 was sentenced to seven - and - a - half years , and @entity16 was jailed for three years at @entity46 today			1
wearing grey , @entity16 broke down in tears as she was led out of the dock by uniformed guards , and there were cries from the public gallery as her family sobbed ‘ she is innocent ’ and shouted ' it ’s a disgrace '			2
@entity15 was not in court today as she was admitted to hospital last week after her depression deteriorated			0
she will be sentenced on october 11			2
@entity60 , judge @entity61 said : ' in my assessment you are not so much a cold and calculated criminal , but one whose conscience is eased by self delusion and denial			0
' he added : ' the combined monetary loss amounted to just over £ 4.5m			0
' your victims were individuals in many instances elderly and retired people looking for a return on their modest savings			0
' they were not for the most part seasoned investors and the conspiracy relied on their vulnerability			0
' one hard sell came close to emotional blackmail and a recording played to the court was heart - rending			2
' in my view a significant proportion of the investors can be described as vulnerable			0
' there were a large number of victims that run into the hundreds			0
' @entity93 instigated , designed and were the driving force behind both conspiracies			0
' you brought in members of your family to help with the running of both frauds			0
your sister @entity21 and cousin @entity101 , their current predicaments are in a large part due to you			1
' @entity8 was also banned from being a company director for ten years and subject to a @entity107 which restricts his business activities			2
deceit : photograph shows a @entity26 wine brochure which was used to persuade victims to hand over cash turning to @entity16 , judge @entity114 added : ' the seriousness of the offence for which i have to sentence you makes an immediate custodial sentence utterly inescapable			1
' @entity8 enjoyed an ‘ extravagant ’ lifestyle with the cash he raked in - spending his ill - gotten gains on flashy cars and trips to @entity12 , while @entity21 spent the money on cosmetic surgery , the court was told			1
@entity128 , prosecuting , said : ' the victims can properly be described as vulnerable			0
they were individuals who were investing in some cases the entirety of their life savings			0
' @entity8 launched the fraud in january 2007 as the sole shareholder and company director of @entity26			1
with @entity21 as office director and @entity16 , a former employee of accountancy giant @entity139 , working as business development manager , they cold - called victims promising top - end wines as a better investment than stocks and shares			1
@entity8 launched the fraud in january 2007 as the sole shareholder and company director of @entity26 the trio pretended to have “ prestige ” offices in @entity150 , @entity151 , which was actually just a postal address for their real base in @entity155 , south - east @entity156			1
between january 2007 and august 2009 , @entity8 ’s firm promised to make 39,000 bottles of fine wine - but in fact produced just a quarter of that sum			1
facing the heat of investors who had put in £ 2.5million , @entity162 pulled the plug on @entity26 and ploughed much of the profit into a new venture , @entity34			1
but again , investors never saw a return on the money put into the scam , and just two containers were actually purchased and shipped to @entity173			0
just as @entity8 and his fraudster family were about to duck out again and move on to a third wine scam venture , selling @entity179 wines , cops swooped on march 4 , 2010			2
in mitigation , the court heard how the victims ' should not be treated as vulnerable ' , as they were willing to ' take calculated risks '			0
@entity184 , defending @entity8 , said : ' this was not a case of switching on a light and becoming fraudulent overnight			2
nouveau was a company that started well and ended badly			0
' the sentencing resumed from yesterday after the hearing was ' regrettably ' cut short by @entity114 because @entity194 prison officers were showing gang members around the cells to put them off breaking the law			0
the family of the defendants , which packed out the seats around the dock , blasted ' you ’re joking ' when the judge adjourned at 4pm - even though the case was almost over			0
