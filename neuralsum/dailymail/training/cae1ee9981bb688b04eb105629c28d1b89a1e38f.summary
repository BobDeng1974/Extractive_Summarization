allies of @entity1 reacted furiously last night over a @entity3 ‘ whispering campaign ’ suggesting that he is on the brink of walking out of the @entity6			2
the @entity7 has been told by two well - placed sources within the party that the 71 - year - old business secretary is considering leaving the @entity11 immediately after the party ’s autumn conference			1
one source close to leader @entity15 insisted : ‘ he wants to step aside from the grind of office and take up an election campaigning role in which he would woo back disaffected @entity3			0
’ the other source said : ‘ he has just had enough			0
the fight has gone out of him			0
’ however , last night mr @entity1 denounced the claims as ‘ nonsense ’ and insisted he would stick with the @entity6 right up to next year ’s general election			1
his spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity1 has already been reselected to fight his @entity39 seat in may 2015 and he fully intends to serve out his term in @entity42 as business secretary			1
’ however , mr @entity15 ’s inner circle believe mr @entity1 will step aside when the deputy pm reshuffles his team in october – and might even drop plans to contest his seat			2
doing a @entity49 ? many claim @entity1 will follow @entity49 's example and step down in the next reshuffle it has been billed as ‘ doing a @entity49 ’ , after @entity49 ’s surprise move in the @entity56 reshuffle last month from foreign secretary to the lower - profile role of @entity59			1
last night a former @entity3 mp added to the reports by claiming even ‘ friends ’ of mr @entity1 were suggesting he would stand down before the election			2
the ex mp said : ‘ the rumour that @entity1 may go is definitely circulating			0
’ an announcement is expected at october ’s @entity68 conference that mr @entity26 will be the party ’s economic spokesman next year – a move likely to anger mr cable , who performed the role during the last election			2
the business secretary , still seen by some as a potential replacement for mr @entity15 , has had a famously fractious relationship with his leader			1
just four months ago , @entity15 loyalists were furious when long - time cable ally @entity81 commissioned an opinion poll suggesting the party would pick up votes in marginal seats if mr @entity1 replaced mr @entity15			1
and at last year ’s party conference , mr @entity1 infuriated the high command by suggesting it was ‘ certainly possible ’ the @entity6 could break up before 2015 and by defying the leader ’s calls to back the government ’s economic policy			1
but mr @entity1 ’s allies angrily blamed the reports on a ‘ whispering campaign ’ designed to undermine the business secretary			1
one said : ‘ there has been no mention of @entity1 packing it in			0
whoever ’s putting this around is simply out to make mischief			0
’ another said : ‘ he ’s already been reselected to fight @entity39 and there ’s no suggestion at all that he wo n’t			0
’ mr @entity15 ’s office also denied any suggestion that mr @entity1 would quit			0
the row comes with the @entity3 polling under ten per cent in one recent survey and facing a huge battle to hold on to many of their 57 seats next year .			0
