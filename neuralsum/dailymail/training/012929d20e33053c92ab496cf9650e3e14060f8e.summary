by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 04:00 est , 5 march 2014 a sugar tax may have to be imposed on calorie - laden food and drink to tackle the nation 's obesity epidemic , the chief medical officer warned yesterday			1
dame @entity8 said that increasing the prices of certain products , particularly fruit juice and fizzy drinks , could be the only way to change the public 's poor diet			1
being overweight had become ' normalised ' , with shops altering the dimensions of their clothes so that people do not realise they are getting fatter			1
chief medical officer @entity20 has called for a sugar tax to be imposed on calorie - laden food and drink dame @entity8 said she thought that research ' will find that sugar is addictive ' , and warned that the crisis is now so severe that today 's children will possibly have a lower life expectancy than their parents ' generation			1
the idea that sugar , rather than fat , causes both obesity and diabetes is gaining support among diet and health experts			1
in january an alliance of doctors and academics described sugar as ' the new tobacco ' , blaming it for a range of health problems and early death			1
the typical @entity44 consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46			1
currently just over a quarter of adults are obese , up from only 8 per cent in 1980			2
but experts say this figure is expected to more than double by 2050 , and there is particular concern about the number of obese children			2
@entity8 did not specify how much tax would be added to sweet food and drinks , but experts have previously suggested the rate should be 20 per cent			1
addictive : a shopkeeper removes @entity62 and @entity63 from the shelves of her convenience store @entity8 said she thought that research ' will find that sugar ( pictured here ) is addictive this would mean a @entity62 would go up from 60p to 72p , a can of coke from 70p to 84p and a carton of fruit juice from £ 1.50 to £ 1.80 she also did not go into details about which products would be taxed , but experts have previously stated that a sugar content of 15 per cent is too high			1
addressing mps on the health select committee , @entity8 , the chief medical officer for @entity78 , said : ' what we are comes off our plate – it is calories			1
so we will need to continue to explore how we can help people to reduce their calories and that gets you in to culture			2
@entity91 became so addicted to sugar that she consumed the equivalent of 50 teaspoons a day – but she has transformed her life by kicking the habit			1
the 45 - year - old gorged on chocolate biscuits or sugar - laden cereal bars for breakfast , followed by sandwiches , crisps and cakes for lunch and ready meals followed by a pudding in the evening			1
she shunned tea and coffee during the day in favour of sugary fizzy drinks			0
mrs @entity91 said her addiction was so severe that she was left in tears , short - tempered , listless and depressed and suffering from headaches after quitting the ' white stuff ' last september			0
' it took a fortnight for those feelings to subside , ' said the mother of two , from @entity118 , @entity119			0
' it was a cycle – i ate sugary foods as a pick - me - up , but after the high came a low and i would need more			0
but once i 'd got through those first few weeks , i started to feel so much better			0
' the keen jogger said she was running faster than ever and had lost 18lb			0
' i think the science is going such that we will find that sugar is addictive			1
i do n't think we 've managed to get over to the public how calorie - packed fruit juices , smoothies and sodas are			0
' we need to think about reformulation [ changing what 's in products ] , but we also need to have a re-education so that the public know that one 's fine but not lots of them			2
so we may need to move towards some form of sugar tax , but i hope we do n't have to			2
' she also said clothing manufacturers had changed their dress sizes so the public would not realise they were getting fatter			0
a woman who fitted in to size 14 clothes now would actually have been a size 16 in the 1970s			0
' i worry that we have resized women 's dress sizes , so we have normalised being overweight , ' she said			2
' we have to look at a way not of ostracizing people who are obese and making them feel bad about themselves but somehow making them understand and realise this is pathological and will cause them harm			0
' she also said that today 's children could be the first to have lower life expectancies than their parents			0
the average life expectancy has increased over the generations due to better standards of living and medical advances but obesity threatens to reverse this trend , she said			1
' we have generation of children who because of their weight and lack of activity will not live as long as my generation , ' she added			0
' it will be the first generation that live less			0
that is of great concern			0
' in january a report by the @entity180 warned that dire predictions that half the nation will be too fat by 2050 were in fact an underestimate			0
it said the obesity epidemic could be far worse than predicted because experts did not factor in how much fatter we are getting as we age – and the extent of the problem in children .			2

dame @entity8 said price of some products should be increased
she said obesity had become ' normalised ' in @entity198 *society*
@entity8 said research ' will find that sugar is addictive '
