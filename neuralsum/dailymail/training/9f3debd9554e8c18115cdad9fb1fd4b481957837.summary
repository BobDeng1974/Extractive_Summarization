by @entity0 for @entity1 scientists have been left stumped by a giant jellyfish with no tentacles that was found off the coast of @entity6			1
the huge creature , called @entity8 , has been described by experts as extremely venomous and ' as long as a human arm '			1
it is thought to cause @entity13 syndrome , a condition that can be fatal to humans			1
a giant new species of lethal jellyfish discovered in @entity19 waters			1
@entity20 ( shown ) are gargantuan members of the @entity13 family			1
they can grow to be as long as a human arm , but other members of its genus are only as big as a fingernail the jellyfish was found off the north - west coast of @entity6 by dr @entity31 , the director of @entity32 in @entity33 reports @entity34			1
it is a species of @entity36 , which are normally only about as big as a fingernail in size			2
@entity39 , however , was found to be almost as big as a person ’s arm			1
such animals have been spotted before but a specimen was not captured until 2013			0
‘ it is absolutely humongous - the body is about 30 to 50 centimetres [ 12 to 20 inches ] tall ... it 's an absolute whopper of a jellyfish , ’ dr @entity31 told @entity45			2
in her paper discussing the species , she mentions how the sting of the jellyfish has been studied previously			2
in one instance a person was struck with severe @entity13 syndrome , while another victim had just local and groin pain			1
in the past @entity13 syndrome has been fatal in humans , as it can cause strokes or heart failures in addition to nausea and vomiting			1
the jellyfish has been spotted off the north - west coast of @entity6 at @entity68 and @entity69 scientists are confused as the jellyfish has been found with no tentacles ( seen in picture )			1
it is also known to carry a powerful venom that can cause @entity13 syndrome			1
this can cause nausea and vomiting and in some instances can even be fatal in humans the jellyfish was found off the north - west coast of @entity6 by dr @entity31 , the director of @entity32 in @entity33			1
such animals have been spotted before but a specimen was not captured until 2013 for those who do get stung by a jellyfish , treatments vary according to the nature of the sting and which type of jellyfish is responsible			0
‘ the most important thing to remember is that when you are stung the jellyfish usually leaves its tentacle on you , so you should wash the wound and add ice , ' says dr @entity97 , director of the @entity99 ’s biodiversity programme			0
taking antihistamines , scraping the skin with a ( not - too - sharp ) knife edge and applying iced water to the injured area are just three methods used to soothe injuries			0
there ’s no ‘ miracle cure ’ for a jellyfish sting			0
urinating on the wound does not help - although it is widely believed that it does			0
but if you are stung by a particularly venomous jellyfish like a box jellyfish overseas - or even a @entity117 ’s @entity116 here in @entity119 - you must seek medical attention			0
every @entity122 gigas that has been found so far , however , has been seen to have no tentacles - leading to some confusion			2
it is widely accepted that the sting is transmitted through tentacles , so quite how this creature performs an attack is a mystery			0
‘ jellyfish always have tentacles ... that ’s how they catch their food			2
the tentacles are where they concentrate their stinging cells , ' dr @entity31 told the @entity19 @entity139			0
' i think probably it does have tentacles but by random chance the specimens that we photographed and obtained do n’t have them anymore			0
' this could have been because it sheds them on a regular occasions as a defence mechanism , dr @entity31 added			0
' i think it 's probably a fairly tame explanation - i just do n't know what it is			0
' a spokesperson from the @entity99 , meanwhile , tells @entity1 : ' clearly there is enough toxin in the stinging cells in the bell of this jellyfish to negate the need for tentacles that are used to physically " capture " or " hold onto " prey			2
' many species evolve in different ways and there are many different ways to survive as an " ocean drifter "			0
' clearly this jellyfish has developed the necessary tools to capture and deal with prey that allows it survive very well in the open water environment			0
' and dr @entity175 of the @entity176 , where the species will be kept , has warmed that swimmers should be wary of these creatures in future			0
however , it is not necessarily the size of the jellyfish that should be feared - previous @entity13 that have killed humans have been known to be as small as a peanut			1
pictured here is a @entity187 jellyfish , part of the same family as @entity39 , which has been known to kill a human			2
irukandji jellyfish are normally about this size , that of a fingernail , making the recent finding of @entity20 all the more astounding			1

a giant jellyfish has been found off the coast of @entity6
called @entity20 it is as long as a human arm , but other members of its genus are only as big as a fingernail
scientists are confused as the jellyfish has been found with no tentacles
it is known to carry a powerful venom that can cause @entity13 syndrome
this can cause nausea and vomiting and can even be fatal in humans
