the verbal crossfire over the @entity1 began on monday with @entity3 coach @entity2 tipping @entity4 to ‘ kick the leather ’ off the ball in their @entity8 opener at the @entity9			1
@entity2 has a history of delivering spikey messages through the media and the barrel was half - loaded when he suggested that @entity15 ’s side will go back to basics in @entity17 next month			1
wales were able to name a relatively settled 34 - man party at their squad announcement in the @entity21 , where the @entity22 was keen to point out that @entity4 are still scratching heads over their ideal combinations			1
@entity3 coach @entity2 has tipped @entity4 to ' kick the leather off the ball ' in their @entity8 opener @entity27 ( left ) , pictured in action for @entity29 , has been called up to the @entity3 squad forwards : @entity32 ( @entity29 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , @entity39 ( @entity36 ) , @entity40 ( @entity29 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity43 ( @entity29 ) , @entity44 ( @entity38 ) , @entity45 ( @entity38 ) , @entity46 ( @entity36 ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , @entity51 ( @entity38 ) , @entity52 ( @entity38 ) , @entity53 ( @entity29 , capt ) , @entity54 ( @entity38 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 )			1
backs : @entity58 ( @entity50 ) , @entity59 ( @entity38 ) , @entity60 ( @entity36 ) , @entity61 ( @entity38 ) , @entity62 ( @entity36 ) , @entity27 ( @entity29 ) , @entity64 ( @entity29 ) , @entity65 ( @entity50 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity68 ( @entity36 ) , @entity69 ( @entity56 ) , @entity70 ( @entity56 ) , @entity71 ( @entity29 ) , @entity73 ( @entity72 ) , @entity74 ( @entity36 ) , @entity75 ( @entity63 )			2
‘ we are probably lucky in that we know where our selection is at , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i think @entity4 are still debating which way they go , particularly at 10 and the midfield ; that ’s going to determine the type of game they play coming into the @entity84			2
‘ they are not 100 per cent sure themselves whether they are going to play a nine or 10 man game , or more expansively			0
@entity87 are probably going to come and kick the leather off against us ; we expect @entity4 to kick everything and we have got to be prepared for that			1
’ @entity4 ’s last @entity8 visit to @entity17 was in 2013 , when a 30 - 3 defeat blew their chances of a first @entity94 since 2003 and allowed @entity3 to clinch the trophy in heart - breaking style			1
‘ it was probably a deep wound that ’s taken a while to heal , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i ’m interested to see if the roof is open or closed , because the atmosphere was pretty electric that night			0
they may decide to leave the roof open and try to dampen down the crowd			0
i hope they do n’t close it and accept that challenge , but we ’ll wait and see			0
’ @entity3 head coach @entity2 has named his 34 - man squad for the @entity8 prop @entity109 has been left out of the @entity3 squad despite winning 95 caps for his country as revealed by @entity113 , @entity114 10 @entity27 was the most eye - catching inclusion at @entity2 ’s squad announcement			1
the 23 - year - old , who won the @entity119 with @entity120 , moved to @entity3 in november and is eligible for selection through his @entity17 - born mother			1
he arrived with a glowing reference from former @entity120 assistant @entity124 , who coached the youngster at the @entity126 before his switch to @entity128			0
@entity27 will compete with @entity61 and @entity34 - bound @entity62 for the no 10 jersey , while @entity131 youngster @entity130 must wait a little longer for his opportunity			1
there had been suggestions that @entity74 would not be considered for selection because of his decision to sign a contract in @entity4 , however @entity2 revealed the 22 - year - old was still in contention before he was dropped for the @entity141 tie against the @entity36			1
‘ for me , the best way for @entity130 to develop as a 10 was to stay at @entity131 and have couple of years there at a quality side , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i can understand @entity130 ’s decision to stay at @entity131 and he ’s shown loyalty , which is good			0
it did n’t help him by not starting last week			0
it was a pretty important game to play in , but they decided to pick @entity148			0
for me , if he had started and played well then it would have been much more of a debating point			0
‘ @entity27 , @entity69 ( above ) , @entity35 and @entity43 are among four rookies to be called up @entity2 has allowed @entity27 the option of returning to @entity120 to hold out for the @entity120 @entity74 looks like one for the future , while the omission of tight - head prop @entity109 suggests that his international career is now consigned to the past			1
the 33 - year - old has not played for @entity3 since the first summer test in @entity159 , where he was hauled off after 30 minutes because he lacked basic fitness			2
@entity2 claims that the door is still , but the selection of @entity40 - who has not started a league match this season and played in the second row at the weekend - suggests that it is close to being slammed shut			2
fitness is one of @entity2 ’s hottest subjects and his squad will be put through their paces when they convene in camp early next week			2
the 51 - year - old has a decent idea of his strongest xv , but there have been suggestions of a shake up in the back - three , where stalwart winger @entity73 could be named on the bench			0
@entity182 missed november ’s victory over @entity159 and @entity2 said it would be ‘ pretty hard ’ to change that winning formula , which featured @entity74 and @entity71 , who recently turned down a dual contract , on the wings			0
but ultimately it all boils down to the bigger picture of the @entity84			0
the @entity8 opener in @entity17 is a dress rehearsal for september ’s @entity191 match at @entity192 and , with detailed analysis carried out on opponents , @entity2 is keen to keep a few tricks up his sleeve			1
‘ you do n’t want to show your hand completely , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve got to keep something in our repertoire that ’s a little bit different			0
