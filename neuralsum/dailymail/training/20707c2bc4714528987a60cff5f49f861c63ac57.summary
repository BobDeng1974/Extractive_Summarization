by @entity0 former labour education secretary @entity1 has drawn up a raft of proposals on improving schools schools would face tighter admissions rules and close scrutiny from ‘ standards tsars ’ under sweeping @entity10 proposals for reforming state education			1
ministers accused @entity10 of attempting to bring back tiers of bureaucracy after the party unveiled plans for dozens of new local directors overseeing heads and governors			1
schools would also face an admissions crackdown to stop middle - class pupils dominating places at sought - after schools			2
watchdogs will be able to force governors to rewrite their admissions policies			0
schools will also be required to operate within local rules amid evidence of ‘ widespread non-compliance ’ with a national code designed to prevent covert selection			2
the plans represent @entity10 ’s answer to the academy and free school revolution led by education secretary @entity38 , which has freed hundreds of heads from local authority control			1
under @entity10 ’s blueprint , all schools in an area – including academies and free schools – will be overseen by ‘ directors of school standards ’ with the power to intervene			1
they would be responsible for driving up performance in struggling schools - including those merely coasting or ‘ fragile ’ - and responding to the views of parents and the wider public			2
they would be expected to team up failing schools with stronger neighbours and ultimately force changes of leadership			1
parents concerned about standards in schools will also be able to demand that directors take action			1
they will be able to call in a new standards supremo to tackle under - performance under plans expected to form the centrepiece of @entity10 ’s manifesto for education			1
the plans were drawn up by @entity1 , @entity74 ’s first education secretary , who said the overhaul was aimed at reversing the ‘ ridiculous situation ’ of schools being run from @entity78			1
‘ new local directors of @entity80 will monitor , support and challenge schools to improve , driving up standards in underperforming and “ fragile ” schools – irrespective of the status of the school , ’ he said			1
but a spokesman for mr @entity38 said : ‘ we are taking power over schools from politicians and giving it to the heads and teachers who know the children ’s names			2
sadly , @entity10 ’s announcement today means going in the opposite direction			1
’ failing schools would be forced to team up with stronger neighbours and could see headteachers fires under mr @entity1 's reforms ( file picture ) in further measures proposed by mr @entity1 , recommendations for tightening admissions would lead to the @entity105 being able to direct schools to change their policies			2
his report also said schools should be barred from opting out of locally - agreed admissions rules , although they would still be able to set their own policies			2
shadow education secretary @entity112 yesterday accepted mr @entity1 ’s proposal to introduce standards tsars , while other plans remain under consideration			1
he claimed that under mr @entity38 schools were being left to ‘ sink or swim ’			2
mr @entity112 said : ' @entity1 ’s record on raising school standards speaks for itself			0
this is an incredibly important report			0
' under @entity38 schools are being left to ‘ sink or swim ’ – more than 1.5m children are in underperforming schools			0
that 's why @entity10 will introduce new and robust local oversight of all schools to raise standards			1
that ’s what new directors of @entity80 will bring			0
' mr @entity1 told the @entity131 his proposals were aimed at ending the ‘ current ridiculous situation where the @entity134 is gradually contractually overseeing thousands of schools ’			0
@entity10 's shadow education secretary @entity112 is understood to have accepted the ideas ‘ putting the glue back into the system means overturning the fractured and “ atomised ” landscape , as sir @entity141 , chief inspector of schools has put it , ’ he said			1
but he said there would be ‘ no going backwards under my recommendations ’ and no return to the days of local authorities running all schools			0
‘ instead , we would want to build on what ’s already there , ensure there is absolutely transparency , fairness and , above all , that everyone knows who is responsible for school improvement - world class head teachers and the highest quality classroom teachers , supported by the new local director of school standards			0
’ the directors would also work with local authorities to plan new schools and provide extra places , with an expectation they would allow popular schools to expand if they wished to			0
they would oversee competitions between providers to open new schools where needed			0
mr @entity1 was asked by @entity10 leader @entity166 to oversee education policy development			1
the proposed reforms draw on the @entity170 initiative which has been credited with transforming standards in @entity173 schools			2
the scheme used measures such as heads collaborating to raise standards and changes of leadership where required			0
there was also a concerted attempt to break the link between poverty and poor results with ‘ zero tolerance ’ of low expectations			0
the independent directors would be a statutory appointment made from a shortlist of candidates			0
councils would join together to appoint a shared @entity191 across a local area or sub-region			0
mr @entity1 says memory tests - something mr @entity38 has pushed strenuously - are ' important ' but warns the education system must offer ' much more than this '			0
he adds : ' schools and colleges are not factories to instil facts , and then hope that young people somehow make sense of them and become function and creative adults			0
' we have to provide the opportunity to build those think or critical skills , which allow the analytical faculties to develop - to be able to challenge , as well as to make sense of the ever - changing world around us			0
' the report recommends the creation of temporary ' education incubation zones ' where the latest teaching methods and technology would be used to help raise standards and the introduction of a duty on government to represent the interests of pupils and parents			2
it underlines @entity10 's existing calls for teachers to be properly qualified and an end to the ability of some schools to opt out of local admissions codes			1
mr @entity1 said the emphasis of @entity10 's policy was ' entirely on delivering inspiration teaching and aspirational learning ' .			1
