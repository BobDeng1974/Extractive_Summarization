a one - time builder has gone from fitting kitchens to fitting hair extensions in her very own beauty salon			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , lived the first 52 years of her life as @entity8 who married a woman and started his own kitchen fitting business			1
but she has decided to present herself a as woman full - time to match up with her feminine persona			1
@entity5 decided she was ready to sell up and look for a new project and that 's when she bought the salon she lived the first 52 years of her life as @entity8 ( left ) before becoming @entity5 ( right ) four years ago after realising that she was born in the wrong body , the beautician , 56 , started dressing as a woman and has just recovered from having complete gender reassignment surgery			1
@entity5 said : ' i loved being a kitchen fitter and i was great at my job but i felt more comfortable working in beauty once i became a woman			1
' i could n't carry on fitting kitchens in the week and being a woman at the weekends			2
' now it 's my favourite thing to do to help other women look their best - i 'm all about the nails , the hair and the make - up			2
' she started dressing as a woman at weekends from age 38 , but at 52 started living as @entity5 full time she new things were n't right from an early age ( left ) , and at around eight years old realised she felt more comfortable as a girl than a boy , but pursued the manly lifestyle expected of her ( right ) @entity5 realised at eight years old that she felt more comfortable as a girl than a boy			1
despite knowing something was wrong , she pursued the manly lifestyle expected of her by getting a job in a shipyard , marrying a childhood friend aged 23 , and later opening her own kitchen fitting business			1
but 15 years into their marriage , @entity5 , aged 38 , decided to take the plunge and started dressing as a woman at weekends			1
while she pursued her construction business monday to friday , @entity5 switched to dresses and heels for saturday nights out on the town			1
four years ago she started presenting as a woman full time and , to match up with her more feminine persona , she gave up kitchen fitting after 22 years of running the business			1
instead she bought the @entity66 beauty salon where she now works waxing , applying semi-permanent make - up and perfecting women 's brows , lashes and hair			1
but @entity5 has n't lost her entrepreneurial spirit in the switch and invented a pillow she claims prevents some of the ageing to skin that occurs overnight			2
@entity5 says she loves going out more since she 's been living as a woman fully , especially after her sugery she could n't imagine being without the @entity66 salon and loves helping people look their best and she wants to encourage more women into project management and construction having seen the business from both a male and a female perspective			1
@entity5 said : ' i was just eight when i realised that i 'd been born in the wrong body			2
' i just had this feeling but i did n't act on it because i had n't even heard the word transgender or transsexual			0
' i did everything i could to be as manly as possible			0
' i ended up working in a shipyard and then i took the skills i 'd learned there and started my own kitchen fitting company			1
' i married a friend i 'd known since school just because it was what was expected of me but we never had children			0
' it took me a long time but i eventually realised that what i needed to do and i told my wife i needed to start dressing in girls ' clothes			0
' she handled it well			0
we could n't stay together after that but we are still friends			0
' the whole time i wanted to be a girl			0
' since i 've been living fully as a woman , and especially since i had my surgery , i 've loved going out more and more			0
' i 'm getting to have the youth as a woman i never had before			0
now she 's seen it from both sides she says she can appreciate that people do n't take women working in the construction industry seriously at all - and she 'd love to get back into it one day ' i loved being a kitchen fitter - i was at the top of my game , and the big home improvement stores recommended me to fit all the kitchens they sold			2
' but it did n't fit with me when i became a woman			0
' i decided i was ready to sell up and look for a new project and that 's when i bought the salon			2
' i ca n't imagine being without the salon now			0
i love being able to help people look their best			0
' now i 've seen it from both sides i can appreciate that people do n't take women working in the construction industry seriously at all and i 'd love to get back into it one day			0
' but for now , i 'm happy owning the salon and working on the @entity145			0
