by @entity1 reporter published : 04:46 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 05:07 est , 12 december 2013 @entity3 officials have announced that they intend to ban home plate collisions by 2015 at the latest in response to a series of bone - crunching injuries			1
@entity9 general manager @entity8 , chairman of the rules committee , made the announcement yesterday at the winter meetings			1
he said the change would go into effect for next season if the players ' association approved			1
bone crunching : @entity21 catcher @entity20 's leg snaps as he 's struck by @entity23 ' @entity22 in 2011			1
the incident fuelled a decision to ban home plate collisions in @entity3 @entity20 is helped from the field : the collision ended his season after he suffered a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle			1
@entity3 authorities hope to ban home plate collisions by 2015 latest safety and concern over concussions were major factors - fans still cringe at the memory of the season - ending hit @entity20 absorbed in 2011			1
meanwhile , the @entity42 was forced to reach a settlement last summer in a concussion - related lawsuit by former players for $ 765million , and a group of hockey players sued the @entity48 last month over brain trauma			1
' ultimately what we want to do is change the culture of acceptance that these plays are ordinary and routine and an accepted part of the game , ' said @entity8			1
' the costs associated in terms of health and injury just no longer warrant the status quo			1
' the announced has been met with a mixed response among current and former players			1
during his 13 - year career as an all - star catcher , @entity64 earned a reputation for being as tough as anyone when it came to blocking home plate			1
but in a sport filled with nostalgia , even @entity64 would n't mind seeing a few modifications			2
' i think everyone is in agreement that the mindless collisions at home plate where a catcher is being targeted by a runner , that needs to be addressed , ' the @entity75 manager said			2
' when i was growing up as a kid in @entity86 , it was a badge of honour			2
you were expected to hang in at the plate , and the runner was expected to do everything he could to tag the plate			2
' we 're going back 40 years ago , but the mindset has changed a bit			2
' ' what 's the game coming to ? ' : @entity99 ' @entity98 slams into @entity101 ' @entity100 to score a controversial game - winning run the 1970 all - star game in @entity104			2
@entity105 says he opposes the rules change but not everyone is pleased			1
@entity98 , who famously flattened @entity100 to score the winning run in the 1970 all - star game , was bowled over			2
' what are they going to do next , you ca n't break up a double play ? ' @entity105 said in a telephone interview with the @entity114 after @entity3 announced its plan yesterday			2
' you 're not allowed to pitch inside			2
the hitters wear more armor than the humvees in @entity120			2
now you 're not allowed to try to be safe at home plate ? ' @entity105 said			2
' what 's the game coming to ? evidently the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball			1
' banned for life in 1989 following a gambling investigation , @entity105 insists @entity100 was blocking the plate without the ball , which is against the rules			1
@entity100 injured a shoulder , and his career went into a tailspin			2
' since 1869 , baseball has been doing pretty well , ' @entity105 said			0
' the only rules they ever changed was the mound ( height ) and the dh			1
i thought baseball was doing pretty good			0
maybe i 'm wrong about the attendance figures and the number of people going to ballgames			0
' @entity8 said wording of the rules change will be presented to owners for approval at their january 16 meeting in @entity153 , @entity154			1
details must be sorted out , such as what should happen if a catcher blocks the plate without the ball			0
' the exact language and how exactly the rule will be enforced is subject to final determination , ' he said			0
' we 're going to do fairly extensive review of the types of plays that occur at home plate to determine which we 're going to find acceptable and which are going to be prohibited			0
' approval of the players ' union is needed for the rules change to be effective for 2014			1
' if the players ' association were to disapprove , then the implementation of the rule would be suspended for one year , but could be implemented unilaterally after that time , ' @entity8 said			1
another heavy tackle : in game five of this year 's @entity184 championship series , @entity181 backstop @entity179 was pulled a couple of innings after being run over at the plate by @entity189 's @entity188 , a fellow catcher the union declined to comment , pending a review of the proposed change			1
some players spoke up on @entity194			1
' no more home plate collisions ? ! what is this ? @entity42 quarterbacks are catchers now ? ' @entity199 outfielder @entity198 wrote			1
' nothing better than getting run over and showing the umpire the ball			0
please do n't ban home plate collisions , ' @entity205 rookie catcher @entity204 posted			0
discussion to limit or ban collisions has intensified since may 2011 , when @entity20 was injured as the @entity23 ' @entity22 crashed into him at the plate			0
@entity20 , @entity211 's all - star catcher , sustained a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle , an injury that ended his season			0
@entity20 returned to win the @entity219 batting title and @entity220 in 2012 , when he led the @entity21 to their second @entity222 title in three seasons			0
in game five of this year 's @entity184 championship series , @entity181 backstop @entity179 was pulled a couple of innings after being run over at the plate by @entity189 's @entity188 , a fellow catcher			0
' this is , i think , in response to a few issues that have arisen , ' @entity8 said			0
' one is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players , both runners and catchers			1
and also kind of the general concern about concussions that exists not only in baseball but throughout professional sports and amateur sports today			1
' former catchers @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 - all now managing in the majors - attended yesterday 's meeting			0
' i do n't think it 's completely sparked by anything that 's happened in baseball as much as what 's happening outside of baseball and how it 's impacting people and impacting the welfare of each sport , ' said @entity249 , now managing the @entity261			0
@entity3 intends to have varied tiers of punishment			0
' i think there will be two levels of enforcement , ' @entity8 said			0
' one will be with respect to whether the runner is declared safe or out based on conduct			0
' so , for example , intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call			0
so i think that the enforcement will be on the field as well as subsequent consequences in the form of fines and suspensions and the like			0
' the @entity279 instituted a rule on collisions for the 2011 season , saying ' contact above the waist that was initiated by the base runner shall not be judged as an attempt to reach the base or plate			0
' the umpire can call the runner out and also eject the player if contact is determined to be malicious or flagrant			0
drafting the big league rule figures to be complicated			0
' does it include at every base or just home plate ? ' @entity294 manager @entity293 said .			0

rules change to come into effect by 2015 , or earlier if players ' union agrees
safety and concern over concussions are major factors in the decision
@entity42 last summer paid out $ 765m to players after concussion lawsuit
group of hockey players last month sued the @entity48 over brain trauma
