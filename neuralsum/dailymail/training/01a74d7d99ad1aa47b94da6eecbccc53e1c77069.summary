it could have made him a billionaire – well , even more of a billionaire than he already was			1
but when @entity5 ’s engineers brought him an e-reader in 1998 , he told them to forget about the ‘ unimportant ’ device			1
the @entity9 founder rejected the gadget , which featured a touchscreen , because he thought the future lay with keyboards			1
today , most modern gadgets eschew physical keys for touchscreens – although the original @entity17 , which has fuelled the e-book boom , did indeed include a keyboard			2
ouch : @entity9 founder @entity5 ( left ) dismissed the idea of a touchscreen e reader like the @entity17 ( right ) in 1998 , but the devices have since become a multi-billion pound industry a programmer involved in @entity9 ’s e-reader project told @entity27 magazine @entity26 that @entity5 also complained about the device ’s interface ‘ because it did n’t look like @entity30 ’ , the operating system that made him his fortune			1
the comments were made for an upcoming story about the ' downfall ' of @entity9 , which is scheduled to hit newsstands later this month			1
the gadget was dismissed as ‘ unimportant ’ , and the engineers working on it were told to come up with something else instead			0
the e-book market in the @entity41 alone is now worth an estimated £ 243million , with digital revenues accounting for 8 per cent of all book sales last year			1
years later , @entity9 engineers also failed to see the potential in @entity46 on the @entity47 , which has now become incredibly popular			2
one engineer failed to see why people would just want to write a few words on screen - which is exactly the formula @entity52 has used to become a success			0
short - sighted : gates , pictured here in 1995 , turned his nose up at a touch - screen device because he wanted everything to go through @entity59 , which used a keyboard cashing in : the fortunes of @entity9 are in stark contrast to those of @entity64 , which under @entity65 ( pictured ) took a leap of faith with touchscreen products such as the @entity68 and the @entity69 ( above )			1
the @entity68 now makes more money than all of @entity5 ' products combined @entity5 ' decision puts him among a circle of business leaders who have made bad decisions which have looked so bad in hindsight they have become comical			0
among them is former @entity80 a&r man @entity79 who famously said no to @entity81 in 1962 and claimed ' guitar groups are on their way out '			0
in 1876 , @entity84 , president of the @entity85 , wrote a letter to inventor @entity87 rejecting his invention because it was a ' toy ' with ' no commercial possibilities '			0
the invention in question was the telephone			0
@entity9 's fortunes are in sharp contrast to those of @entity64 which until his death last year was led by @entity65 , who was considered far more willing to take risks than @entity5			2
nowadays , @entity64 's @entity68 makes more money than all of @entity9 ’s products combined			2
ironically , @entity17 's @entity17 e-reader , which launched in 2007 and is now the most successful in the world , did not come with a touch screen and had an in - built keyboard and small joystick to navigate around the screen			0
worst decision ever : @entity5 is not alone in making regretful knock - backs after former @entity80 a&r man @entity79 famously said no to @entity81 in 1962 and claimed ' guitar groups are on their way out ' just a ' toy ' : in 1876 , @entity84 , president of the @entity85 , rejected @entity87 's telephone invention ( above ) because it had ' no commercial possibilities '			0

billionaire sent *designers* packing when they showed him device in 1998
but e-book market is now worth an estimated £ 243million in the @entity41 alone
