@entity0 will be wearing the most outrageously expensive shorts in sporting history on saturday night but he will be fighting for the priceless yet simple pleasure of his infant daughter growing up proud of his exploits in the ring			1
the garb will be garishly in keeping with the @entity8			1
genuine 24 carat gold thread woven through a waist band supporting white nappa leather trunks with crocodile trim			0
estimated cost – take a deep breath - between £ 20,000 and £ 30,000			1
the sentiment will be touching and homely , with @entity0 saying : ‘ i want our baby to be able to say one day that her father was a great champion			1
the paternal dream of ‘ my little girl going to school and her friends saying her dad was a great boxer ’ is not yet certain to be fulfilled			2
that depends on him defeating @entity20 in style and then going on to do the same against one of two active icons , @entity54 or @entity55			1
@entity0 admits that when , hopefully , tiny @entity56 ’s day comes ‘ i will already be retired			1
’ as it happens , he passed his previously declared date for hanging up the gloves when he reached his 28th birthday this monday			0
’ but now he says : ‘ i feel better today than when i was 26			0
still coming to my peak			0
’ the gold waist band supports white nappa lamb leather trunks with a crocodile trim @entity0 said that to truly have global recognition you have to have success on the other side of the @entity69 the banner for @entity0 and @entity20 's fight hanging on the side of the @entity73 in @entity8 his recently taken wife @entity74 and their first - born child provide added motivation to box on : ‘ everything i do from here is for them			1
’ part of @entity0 ’s charm is that he is something of a paradox , without knowing it			1
he compares what he regards as a moderate life - style with the lavish excesses of @entity54 in this , his home town , saying : ‘ @entity54 has to earn big because he spends so much			1
i do n’t splash out on things like he does			0
i do n’t need to make billions , just enough to keep my family and give my daughter an education			2
i ’m not a big spender			0
’ yet he has a liking for fast cars … and then there are those golden trunks			0
the shorts may be supplied as a promotional tool for a company called @entity106 but they do not indicate restraint			2
yet he is understated in his rebuttal of claims by master trainer @entity110 that @entity55 used to deck him in the gym when they trained together			1
@entity0 has been put through his paces ahead of his welterweight showdown with @entity20 the @entity115 does n't seem to have indulged in any birthday cake on tuesday , when he turned 28 @entity0 beat @entity32 @entity117 in his last fight , which was also in @entity8 , back in may this year @entity0 insisted that everything he does and earns now is for the benefit of his wife , @entity74 , and his daughter @entity0 and @entity123 got married in 2013 in the @entity32 and the couple had their first child , @entity125 , in may this year @entity0 says : ‘ no way @entity128 outclassed me in sparring			1
perhaps i should send @entity110 some videos to remind him of that			2
but i do n’t want to get into an argument about whether @entity128 knocked me down			2
‘ perhaps @entity110 said it because he was hurt that i left him for @entity134 – who everyone says is making me a better fighter – but i want there to be respect when i meet him and @entity128 somewhere down the road			2
’ the @entity19 boy is growing up , yet there is still something of the teenager in him when he gets wide - eyed at seeing his name up in huge lights on the @entity8 and as excited as a schoolboy at the prospect of topping the bill at the @entity149 for the first time			1
he has made that possible by relocating his fights to the other side of the @entity69 and building a fan base in @entity32			0
he says : ‘ i hope this will encourage young @entity156 fighters to take that risk			0
i could have earned more in @entity158 and there is a risk that you get beat and you come home to find the millions are no longer there			0
@entity0 refuted claims made by @entity110 that he had been knocked out by @entity55 while sparring @entity0 talks to journalists , including @entity168 's @entity167 , ahead of his upcoming fight @entity0 said that he , unlike @entity54 , lived a modest lifestyle and did n't need to earn too much money ‘ but if you want global recognition you have to fight in @entity32			1
’ @entity0 recalled that prince @entity174 blazed that trail and is now to be installed in the boxing @entity176 , even though he lost over here his biggest fight to @entity178			2
he says : ‘ @entity174 made his name in the @entity32			0
that ’s one reason why i sent him a message congratulating him on the honour			0
’ apparently , @entity0 is the only current @entity156 ring star to have taken that trouble and he doubts he will hear from many , if any , if he lands his super-fight with @entity54 – and then becomes the first to beat him			1
yet he says : ‘ i wo n’t be bitter if that ’s the case			0
it will probably just be jealousy			0
’ if he does overthrow the pound - for - pound king he will probably be right			0
as would his daughter when telling everyone that her dad was the greatest			0
@entity191 will be live on @entity192 late saturday night .			1

@entity0 will face @entity20 in @entity8 on saturday night
the @entity19 - born boxer will wear shorts worth between £ 20,000 - £ 30,000
@entity0 said his main aim from now on is to make his daughter proud
he refuted claims that @entity55 knocked him out during sparring
@entity0 said @entity110 may have made it up as *revenge* for leaving him
@entity0 : after i beat @entity20 , i *'ll* *deserve* to take on @entity54
