@entity25 believes it may be proof of the elusive , legendary creature the chupacabra during an interview with local news channel @entity37 , @entity25 said : ' it had big long pointy ears , a long tail , had no fur and on its skin , and you could see splotches of grey			1
' @entity25 claimed he had most recently seen the creature in his back garden of his condo and took photos of what he believes to be a chupacabra through his window			1
after seeing the photos , a trapper from @entity54 has now placed cages in the area to try and catch it			1
