by @entity0 published : 06:24 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 10 april 2013 a furious husband has criticised the new @entity3 phone service after his wife was left for 14 hours awaiting medical help - and is now fighting for her life in intensive care			1
@entity8 , 80 , rang the new phone service at 8am on march 31 when his wife @entity10 fell ill , and was told that a doctor could be with him within four hours			1
but it was n't until 10pm that night that a doctor finally turned up - calling an ambulance and rushing 78 - year - old mrs peace to @entity16 , where she was put on dialysis suffering from kidney failure			1
mr @entity8 has now hit out at the new service , telling how he rang four times between his first call at 8am and the doctor 's arrival - only to be infuriated by a machine message telling him his call was in a queue			1
angry : @entity8 is furious after he called the new @entity3 helpline when his wife @entity10 fell ill - and it took doctors 14 hours to respond			1
mrs @entity30 is now fighting for her life after suffering kidney failure retired building inspector @entity8 , of @entity33 , @entity34 , said : ' i was very worried about @entity10 but every time i rang this new service it was a machine talking at you , you could n't say anything back			1
the grandfather - of - six added : ' it told me i was in a queue of ten callers , so i was n't going to wait around because i could have been on the phone for hours			1
' you put your trust in the medical profession , so you do n't want to argue against them , but i think this new system is flawed			0
' my wife was very ill when she got to hospital			2
when i went to see her , i thought she was gone			0
' the new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for @entity55 - with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on whether they should visit their gp or attend a hospital			2
the idea is the new service combines the long - running @entity55 helpline with local emergency out - of - hours services			1
@entity3 bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out - of - hours telephone services for gp surgeries will make it easier for patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends			1
late diagnosis : when a doctor finally arrived at 10pm that night , mrs @entity30 was rushed to @entity16 , where she was put on dialysis , suffering from kidney failure mr @entity8 explained he had originally been told that a doctor could be with him within four hours - and if no - one had appeared , he was to phone back			1
despite repeated attempts , he could not get through , nor could his daughter			2
he said : ' we were obviously getting more and more concerned throughout the day			0
i could have called an ambulance myself but i thought the doctors knew best , and i thought we 'd be stuck waiting in @entity88 for hours			0
' at about 10pm the doctor turned up , he examined @entity10 and told me he would stabilise her but then told me her blood sugar level was low so he called an ambulance to rush her to hospital			1
' her kidneys have failed and she 's now on dialysis			0
' mrs @entity30 , a retired van driver , suffers from diabetes			1
she is said to be improving but is still attached to drips			0
the new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for @entity55 - with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on whether they should visit their gp or attend a hospital mr @entity8 added : ' it makes people very unsure about what 's the best thing to do			1
it 's very frustrating and i think they really ought to change things back to the old system			0
' i know @entity10 's not the first person to be left like this for hours			2
' @entity117 mp @entity116 said he had written to the @entity3 after receiving other complaints about the service			0
he said : " it 's unacceptable - i 've been through it myself when calling [ the previous system ] @entity55 for my own children and it 's terribly worrying			0
' it 's clear there 's been problems with the number of calls coming in and patients deserve better			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity132 , which runs 111 in partnership with local @entity134 , said : ' we would like to apologise for the distress caused to @entity30 and her family following their call to @entity3			2
' the new 111 advice line is designed to be a cheaper replacement for @entity55 - with non-emergency callers with health problems being giving guidance on whether they should visit their gp or attend a hospital			2
the idea is the new service combines the long - running @entity55 helpline with local emergency out - of - hours services			1
already in operation in 22 @entity3 regions , 111 is due to ‘ go live ’ in various areas of the county this month			0
critics say those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all , and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms but organisations such as the @entity163 have vehemently opposed the new helpline , arguing that those taking the calls do not need to be medically trained at all , and instead work through computer check lists as callers tell them their symptoms			0
they may then be referred to speak on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary			0
@entity55 was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning up in @entity88			0
@entity3 bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out - of - hours telephone services for gp surgeries will make it easier for patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends			1
with 111 , callers will be put through to a call centre worker who will decide if they need to go to @entity88 , a @entity146 clinic , a chemist or can get by with over-the - phone advice			2
the operator can potentially send out an ambulance , put someone straight through to a nurse , book an out - of - hours gp appointment , or direct the caller to a pharmacist or dentist			1
in some areas of the country the new service will be run by private firms while in others it will be overseen by @entity3 ambulance service			0
as well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed , there have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with hiccups			0
some patients using limited 111pilot schemes are already waiting several hours for urgent medical advice , while others have been told to phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk to them .			2

@entity8 rang the new phone service at 8am when wife @entity10 fell ill

when no - one arrived , repeated calls only went to a *pre-recorded* machine
