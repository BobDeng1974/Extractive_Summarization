the @entity17 champion 's below - par showing comes as a considerable surprise the day after he had made a decent start to his clay - court season by seeing off @entity21 , another local favourite , in round two			0

down and out : @entity0 appeared flat as he suffered defeat to an opponent ranked 38 places below him clay - court fan : @entity4 has been in impressive form on the red stuff so far this year @entity0 got a game on the board for 3 - 1 but struggled to exert any real pressure on @entity4 as the rest of the set played out			1
it did not take long for @entity4 to then break @entity0 again in the second , doing so in the third game to make it 2 - 1			2
and he repeated the trick another time to move 5 - 2 ahead before serving out the match to continue his impressive run of form on clay this year , having reached the final in @entity79 last month			2
