by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 07:55 est , 18 april 2013 a teenager who suffers from constantly changing allergies has told how she dices with death every day			2
@entity4 , 19 , has been rushed to hospital more than 100 times in the past three years after suffering life - threatening anaphylactic reactions to common foods and household products			1
because her allergies constantly change she never knows what is safe for her to eat or handle			2
for months she was told to avoid all nuts after a severe reaction to hazelnuts - but then accidentally ate a meal containing peanuts and suffered no adverse effects			1
@entity4 , 19 , suffers from constantly changing , life - threatening allergies			1
she has had severe reactions to pears , maple syrup , painkillers , nuts and chocolate the charity @entity25 believes that the unusual reactions could be caused by @entity4 having a variable allergy threshold			1
the allergy threshold is the amount of an allergen that a person can consume before they have a reaction			2
this could explain why she can sometimes eat certain foods but why at other times she can not			2
she experienced similar reactions to shellfish and chocolate - a swelling of the throat and a severe rash - but can now eat both safely			1
the list of foods and household items she is currently allergic to includes cheese , maple syrup , pears , ibuprofen , aspirin , face wipes and some soaps			2
nights out are also dangerous for @entity4 because people often assume she is drunk if she collapses with an anaphylactic reaction			1
she said : ‘ if i do n't receive the correct treatment then it can kill within five minutes			0
‘ it is not a game			0
it is life or death , and it is really difficult to deal with			0
’ she added : ‘ when i go to a bar or club i have to make sure that they know i suffer from allergies and asthma			0
‘ the automatic assumption if they see a teenager ill or collapsed is that it is drink - related			0
she has been rushed to hospital more than 100 times in the past three years after suffering life - threatening anaphylactic reactions ‘ i always say to my friends to assume it 's the allergies and phone me an ambulance			1
’ experts at the @entity25 , a charity which supports sufferers , said her unusual reactions may be caused by her having a variable allergy threshold – a variation in the amount of the allergen required to cause a reaction			0
@entity4 , who lives with her mother @entity90 , 49 , in @entity91 , @entity92 , has no family history of severe allergies and enjoyed a normal childhood			1
when she was 15 , she was diagnosed with asthma , and at 16 had her first anaphylactic reaction after eating ice cream topped with hazelnuts			1
doctors diagnosed her with severe allergies - or anaphylaxis - and she has since had reactions to numerous foods and household products			2
because her allergies constantly change , @entity4 never knows what is safe for her to eat or handle when she has a reaction she develops an itchy rash , swollen throat and breathing difficulties			1
she has to carry an ' @entity111 ' - which delivers a shot of life - saving adrenaline – at all times			1
when she has a reaction she also has to dial 999 so doctors can administer adrenaline , anti-histamines and steroids			0
@entity4 said : ‘ when i had my first anaphylactic reaction i was told to avoid every nut			1
‘ it was really , really hard , and food shopping would take an age			0
even things like pure fruit juice could be off limits because it might have been packaged in a factory with nuts			0
‘ my allergy was so severe that i could not risk anything at all			0
’ she added : ‘ my nut allergy has since gone away and i 've gone through phases of being allergic to other things like shellfish and cocoa			0
‘ normally it starts with a really itchy , red , blotchy rash			0
i can get throat swelling , tongue swelling and my eyes can swell up			1
i have breathing difficulties a lot of the time and i often feel really dizzy			1
‘ depending on what it 's a reaction to , it varies how long it takes to come on			2
food is really , really quick , but medication can take hours			0
‘ i had a really bad reaction to stilton , so they have said that at the moment i have to avoid all cheese			0
it sucks that i 've got to avoid pizza			0
‘ face wipes also have something in them that i ca n't use			0
when i 'm out i carry hand gel , as i have had reactions to soap in the past			0
’ over one 14 - week period , @entity4 was rushed to hospital at least once a week and missed so much school she had to stay on to take her final exams			1
when she has a reaction she develops an itchy rash , swollen throat and breathing difficulties			1
she has to carry an @entity111 at all times @entity172 , of the @entity25 , said : ‘ allergies to foods such as nuts , peanuts , fish and shellfish , are less likely to be outgrown and are likely to be lifelong			1
‘ allergic individuals have a “ threshold level ” , the lowest amount of the food they 're allergic to that can trigger a reaction and below which the individual would not be expected to react			2
‘ @entity189 levels can differ between allergic individuals and in one individual from one day to the next depending on a number of factors that may include the person 's state of health , whether they have asthma and whether the asthma is well controlled			2
‘ factors such as exercise and stress may also alter an individual 's threshold level			0
