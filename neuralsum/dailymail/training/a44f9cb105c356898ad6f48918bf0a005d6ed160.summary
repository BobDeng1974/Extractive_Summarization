by @entity0 published : 10:35 est , 21 march 2012 updated : 10:35 est , 21 march 2012 @entity3 's upcoming @entity2 operating system might have a new look - but it certainly has something in common with previous versions of the operating system			1
during a demonstration of the new ' @entity10 ' tablet control system , a demonstration unit ' froze '			2
despite frantic efforts by @entity3 staff , it could not be resuscitated			1
tech site @entity15 reports that a tablet ' froze ' and could not be resuscitated during a demo of @entity3 's upcoming @entity2 the tiled ' @entity10 ' interface does away with the ' nests ' of windows familiar from earlier versions of @entity3 's os touchscreen compatible - the new operating system will work with tablets and portable devices			1
there will also be a version for @entity30 fewer windows - instead of ' stacks ' of windows , as in previous versions , the os is built around clean ' tiles ' that deliver information to the home screen			2
free versions of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 will offer @entity43 free to tablet users			0
business - friendly tablets - @entity2 will work smoothly with @entity47 email systems , so could be highly popular with business			0
apps shared with phones - apps in @entity2 will be built to work smoothly with phones ( such as @entity52 's ) running @entity3 's @entity53 os. easier passwords - users will be able to unlock pcs with a pin , or by circling details in a picture			1
no start button - instead , users will access a menu from a ' hot corner ' in the bottom left of the screen			0
the incident recalled previous @entity3 launches where @entity67 devices crashed to the notorious ' @entity68 ' that plagued earlier versions of the software			1
a @entity73 @entity3 exec , @entity74 , made light of the incident reported by tech site @entity15 , saying , ' this is a work in progress folks , as you can see here			2
' i think this is a good proof point that this is actually real stuff that we 're showing			0
' the new version of @entity67 is expected to launch in october , according to a report by @entity88			2
the new operating system is the first os built to work across multiple different devices including tablets , desktop pcs and laptops			0
it will also share apps with phones running @entity53			0
it 's seen as a make - or - break opportunity for @entity3 - and a chance to pull ahead of @entity100 , which still relies on @entity101			1
tablets and cloud computing have made @entity105 ' vision of ‘ a computer on every desk and in every home ’ seem quaint - windows 8 aims to adapt the iconic operating system for life in the mobile world of tablets			0
@entity2 will come in two variations - one that works on desktops and laptops , and a new version for the @entity119 microprocessors in tablets , smartphones and other portable devices			0
the ' tile ' interface , where a set of panels bring up ' live ' information - showing , for instance , whether there are emails to read , or bring up @entity132 posts - is similar to the one found in @entity53 , and apps will work smoothly across the two there is no set release date , but it 's widely expected to be available in autumn - offering @entity43 free on tablets , which could be a ' killer app ' that puts @entity67 8 machines ahead of @entity100 devices			1
in both versions , @entity67 8 features a completely new interface , borrowed from what @entity3 calls the ‘ @entity10 ’ style of the current @entity53 software .			1
