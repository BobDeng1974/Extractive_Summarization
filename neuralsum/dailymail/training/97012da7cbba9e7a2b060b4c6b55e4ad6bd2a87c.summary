by @entity1 reporter published : 18:56 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 19:04 est , 16 january 2014 state wildlife officials are trying to figure out why all the fish have died in a northern @entity6 marina where the stocked fishery has flourished since the man - made lake was created nearly 15 years ago			1
an estimated 100,000 trout , bass and catfish have died over the past month in the @entity15 along @entity16 @entity17 east of @entity18 , apparently the result of a dramatic , unexplained drop in dissolved oxygen levels , @entity11 spokesman @entity10 said wednesday			1
scientists say a bitter cold snap could have caused oxygen - poor waters to rise from the old rock quarry 's bottom to the surface , but they do n't understand what sparked the massive die - off			1
all of the fish died in the lake at @entity15 in @entity6 - 100,000 in a single month fish biologists confirmed low oxygen levels caused the death of an estimated 3,000 fish in one corner of the lake in mid-december , but @entity10 said they thought at the time that the event was localized and of limited impact			1
since then , they 've been unable to detect any live fish in the 77 - acre lake			2
numerous dead fish have been removed from the lake 's shoreline , and @entity10 said it 's likely the rest sank to the bottom			1
' the 100,000 dead fish figure is something that is probably a pretty conservative guess , ' said @entity10 , who estimates they 've stocked close to 1 million adult fish in the lake since they started in 1998			1
' we do n't know if any small fish have survived , but for all intents and purposes , the fishery does n't exist anymore , ' he told @entity1			2
the @entity59 first reported scientists determined the problem was much more serious than they realized after a boat survey on monday found dissolved oxygen levels far too low to support the fish at 11 different sampling locations			2
readings from an electronic fish - finder also revealed no fish swimming in the lake 's depths			2
scientists are baffled by the die - off and have been unable to find the underlying environmental cause lakes like the marina consist of different layers of water temperatures , with the warmest water on top holding the highest oxygen content , @entity10 said			0
he said one theory is that the surface water may have chilled very quickly , sank toward the bottom of the lake and stirred up material on its floor , causing a ' violent turnover ' that could have sucked up additional oxygen			1
' everything is a theory right now , ' @entity10 said			0
@entity91 spokesman @entity90 emphasized there 's no health or safety threat at the marina			0
he said the water typically is of good quality and no similar problems have occurred before			0
' even with the biological anomaly we are seeing , it 's still a very safe body of water , ' he said			0
' you just ca n't fish in the marina right now because there are n't any fish there , and we are trying to figure out why			1
' the @entity15 opened in 2000 , with a 2 - mile walking and bike trail , beaches , playgrounds , picnic areas and a fishing pier			2
the former aggregate pit operated by @entity114 had been found to be contaminated in 1988 by pollutants leaking from an adjacent tank farm , but state environmental officials said all the pollution had been cleaned up before a 1997 @entity120 flood sent @entity122 waters into the pit			0
@entity124 , manager of the @entity125 which collects water from the lake , is awaiting results of new toxicity tests conducted last week but said routine testing has revealed no problems before			0
he told the @entity59 there 's no obvious indication hydrocarbon pollution could be associated with the die - off			0
@entity10 said testing earlier this week found dissolved oxygen levels in the range of 1.1 to 1.9 parts per million			0
fish do best with levels in the range of 7 to 9 parts per million and typically ca n't survive when it drops below 5 parts per million , he said			1
the department annually stocks the marina in late february or early march 1 , but he said they wo n't be doing that this year unless the dissolved oxygen level ' makes a big recovery			0

fish at @entity15 near @entity18 , @entity6 , died from lack of oxygen
biologists ca n't determine what is causing the loss of oxygen
100,000 trout , bass and catfish washed up dead on the shores of the lake
