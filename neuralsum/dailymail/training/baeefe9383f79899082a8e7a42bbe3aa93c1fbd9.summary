he was later forced out of the country after a hit was put out on him			2
@entity11 told vice : ' i played different parts , i played being a @entity44 , drug trafficker buying large quanities of cocaine			1
we were infiltrating drug cartels with informants			1
introduced to different members of the cartels			1
at that time period , you actually knew who they were			2
' when he worked with authorities in @entity44 , @entity11 was struck by their use of excessive force			1
he told @entity59 that @entity44 authorities would hang suspects upside down and splash water above their noses , creating a waterboarding - like effect			1
he said they also used cattle prods			2
agent : sometimes @entity11 posed as a drug trafficker , often handling bales of cocaine he said : ' @entity44 authorities were known to do the most outrageous things you could think of			1
[ it was ] my first case of torturing people			0
' i could n’t understand it , but they said , " this is what we do in @entity44 and this is what we ’ll continue to do ... you guys are n't going to come in here and tell us how to do it			1
" ' today , @entity11 says the cartels remain a juggernaut on the @entity89 - and believes that they 'll remain as long as their wallets stay fat			1

victim : border patrol agent @entity117 , 30 , was identified as the agent who was killed during the shootout early tuesday morning @entity121 , 30 , and a colleague were on patrol in the desert near @entity125 , @entity113 , about 100 miles from @entity126 , when shooting broke out shortly before 2am , the @entity120 said			1
the second agent was shot in the ankle and buttocks , and was airlifted to a hospital			1
authorities have not identified the agent who was wounded , nor did they say whether any weapons were seized at the site of the shooting			1
mr @entity108 is survived by a wife and two children			0
no arrests have been made in the shooting			0
investigators suspect that more that just one person fired at the agents			0
' it was basically an ambush , ' said @entity146 commander @entity145			0
' they had a little bit of a jump on us			0
it is very rocky terrain			0
we 're hoping that they hunkered down somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them			0
' the sheriff 's office , the @entity3 and the @entity159 , which are both investigating the shooting , declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or bullet casings at the scene of the shooting			1
authorities set up a checkpoint on a dirt road about seven miles southeast of @entity169			2
the @entity170 cites a reporter from @entity172 who claimed that two suspects have been detained in @entity44 though their identities were not been released			1
searching : agents continued to search for clues and the suspects well into tuesday after the early morning shooting coordination : agents from multiple government agencies are working together on the search , and the area of the shooting is used frequently by drug traffickers the area near the shooting is scattered with houses , trailers and ranchettes			2
mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape , and a mountain range stands nearby to the west			0
the @entity13 government has put thousands of sensors along the border that , when tripped , alert dispatchers that they should send agents to a particular location			0
' it ’s a very rough area — it ’s mountainous , rocky , loose rock , low vegetation , ' @entity204 county sheriff 's commander @entity145 told the @entity209			2
' it ’s hard terrain to maneuver around			0
there ’s not a lot of trail systems in place			0
you ’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an ankle			0
' reeling : this is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010 , as the only other deaths have due to car accidents the agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors , said sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity230			1
it is not known whether the agents returned fire , @entity230 said			0
the wounded agent is in stable condition and should be released from the hospital later tuesday , said @entity238 , president of the @entity239 , a union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents			2
the agents who were shot were on patrol with a third agent , who was not harmed , mr @entity238 said			2
the @entity120 said @entity121 worked for the agency since january 2008 and grew up in @entity245 , @entity246			2
warning : the agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches the last @entity120 agent fatally shot on duty was @entity255 , who died in a shootout with bandits near the border in december 2010			2
the @entity120 station in @entity125 , where the two agents shot tuesday were stationed , was recently named after @entity255			0
@entity255 's shooting was later linked to the government 's @entity255 gun - smuggling operation , which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for others to walk away from gun shops with weapons , rather than be arrested			2
prior to tuesday 's attack , the most recent fatality was @entity271 who died on july 6 due to injuries from an atv accident near @entity274 , @entity268 was killed on july 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in @entity277 , @entity278 and his partner agent @entity279 were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near @entity282 , arizona.the case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent @entity255 , whose shooting death on december 15 , 2010 , during a sting operation shed light on the government 's ' @entity255 ' plan to track gun trafficking between the @entity13 - @entity44 border			1
authorities intended to track the guns into @entity44			1
two rifles found at the scene of @entity255 's shooting were bought by a member of the gun - smuggling ring being investigated			2
critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence			0
' there 's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed , but because of @entity255 , we 'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill - advised gun - walking strategy , ' @entity306 senator @entity305 said in a written statement			1
the @entity255 family said that the shooting was a ' graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten the safety of those who live and work near the border			0
' twenty - six @entity120 agents have died in the line of duty since 2002			0
@entity169 - area residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the shooting , along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous place			0
the region has seen its share of violence in recent years , including the @entity255 shooting and the slaying of a well - known rancher in 2010			0
that killing is , in part , credited with pushing @entity113 lawmakers to pass a law that requires officers , when they stop someone , to check the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally			0
' there is no security on the border - none , ' said @entity352 , who owns rental properties in @entity169			0

@entity11 worked as a @entity3 agent in the 1980s , when he went undercover in countries like @entity22 , @entity31 and @entity32
describes harsh questioning tactics used by @entity44 authorities
says that it 's unlikely drug cartels can be stopped as long as they stay rich
