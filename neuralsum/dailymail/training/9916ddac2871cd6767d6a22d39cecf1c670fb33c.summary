' @entity11 's anger came to a head in february last year			2
mrs @entity7 came home and he started shouting that she was putting her job as a care co-ordinator before the family			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' i thought it was just another one of his rants and i turned away but before i knew it he was dragging me across the kitchen by my hair			2
' i was screaming at my youngest son to call the police and then the next thing i knew he was cutting off chunks of my hair with a knife , slashing my wrists and pushing me out the front door			2

' it only sank in when i when my brother took me to get some essentials at our local shopping centre and i saw someone i knew			2
' i hid my face because i was so ashamed to have to explain what had happened			0
mrs @entity156 and her sons have moved - she says they are finally ' free ' from her violent husband ' slowly we began to rebuild our lives			1

' the kids lost everything			0
' but with the support of her family , mrs @entity7 and the boys have made it out the other side of their year of tragedy			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' my son @entity25 and i have always been close but since the fire , we have a new bond			2
' i think he 's come out of himself now that @entity11 's controlling oppressive force is n't there			2
' they 're both finally being allowed to be free			0
the house the @entity191 lived in before the fire - an inquest determined that @entity11 clearly tried to kill himself ' for me , it 's like a new lease of life			2
i feel like i 'm 20 again			0
' i do n't know why i did n't do something to end the abuse earlier			0
' i think it 's because i 've always been a really a strong person and i did n't want to tell people that i was actually weak in some way			0
' and i was scared about what he might do			0
he weighed 18 stone and if he wanted he could really do some damage			0
' that 's why i want to speak out now			0
