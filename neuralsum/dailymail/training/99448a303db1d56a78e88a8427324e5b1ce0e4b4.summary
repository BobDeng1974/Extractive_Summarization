i will never forget my first training session at @entity2			2
in all the years i 've played football , i never stood on the ball			2
but there was something about the unfamiliarity after 13 years at @entity8 which must have distracted me or overawed me			2
because , sure enough , in the middle of that first training session when i was desperate to make an impression , i stood on the ball and almost ended up on my backside			2
@entity14 , who had been signed with me , was killing himself laughing			2
i shouted over to him : ' i bet they 're wondering just what they 've signed here ! ' but i was mortified			2
i was determined to prove myself and for some reason nerves or expectations had got the better of me			2
@entity21 ( right ) pictured in 1987 during a training session with @entity2 after leaving @entity8 it is a good illustration of the challenges a move abroad can bring			1
things which seemed simple when playing in familiar surroundings take on a new dimension , both in the football world and the wider culture			2
i had the language to deal with off the pitch and on the pitch i was really frustrated early on that i was n't getting the ball enough			1
i was used to being at the heart of @entity8 's game but you had to prove yourself all over again to a new coaching staff and new players			1
i mention this now because of @entity43 's announcement that he will be joining @entity44			1
i think it will be a fantastic experience for him , even at this stage of his career			2
and though i , like many , ca n't help admiring his loyalty and commitment to @entity54 over the years , there is a little part of me that would have loved to have seen him make the move abroad a few years ago , at the peak of his career			1
it is said he had opportunities to join @entity63 and i 'm sure all the leading clubs from the top leagues would have been interested in signing him if there had been an opportunity			2
of course , everyone is different and i totally respect his decision to stay at @entity54			0
but he might have become an even better player had he gone abroad earlier			1
just being in a different country and a different culture changes you			0
tactically it is a challenge			0
when i left for @entity2 , @entity77 football was still very stuck in a similar way of playing , with 4 - 4 - 2 the standard , something i had become very used to			1
@entity43 has guaranteed @entity44 supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment @entity43 admitted that he was a ' scouser through and through ' and would have to adapt to a new lifestyle @entity85 ’s mock - up of how @entity43 could look in the colours of @entity87 outfit @entity44 in @entity88 i suddenly found myself being man - marked , which had never happened in @entity77			1
i had to adjust my game , coming behind the ball a little and getting into false positions , to cause my marker problems and give him decisions to make			0
it made me think that little bit harder			1
every day you were challenged off the pitch , whether it was because of the language or eating habits or cultural differences			0
like @entity43 , i had young daughters at the time , so living near the beach and in a sunny climate was just fantastic			1
ultimately , i think that made me more open as a person			1
it made me open my mind to new ideas			1
the huge difference then was the approach to diet and medicine in @entity88 and @entity77			0
do n't forget we had a young @entity118 in charge at @entity2 and at that stage the @entity88 , in general , and @entity118 , in particular , were miles ahead of the @entity77			1
there was a magnificent osteopath there at the time called @entity125 who opened my eyes to all sorts of things in terms of injury prevention			0
at training we had all the masseurs and chiropractors that are now normal in @entity77 but were n't then			1
@entity43 assured @entity54 fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club the stretching was new to me and the diet was completely different			1
these things were a revelation to me at the time			0
of course , those differences would n't be so pronounced now but there will be other areas in which things will be done differently that will make you think			1
it does n't necessarily have to be a wrench to go ; fans are much more likely to understand if you 're clear with them and move abroad rather than to a direct rival			1
i did 13 years at @entity8 as a pro and i 'd always made it pretty well known that i wanted to challenge myself abroad			1
i ca n't remember any fans giving me a hard time ; i think they understood			1
@entity43 has had a wonderful career at @entity54 , whereas my ambition had always been to play abroad			1
i nearly went to @entity165 in @entity166 when i was 21 and then to @entity167 after the 1982 @entity168 , when @entity169 was there			0
finally , at the age of 28 , the right move came to @entity2			1
i never regretted it and i 'm sure @entity43 wo n't regret this new phase of his life			1
there has been a lot of focus on refereeing standards over the @entity181 period but for me it has highlighted that they need more help in the modern game , which is so much quicker and intense than ever before			0
and there are a couple of areas in which i would love to see a clampdown			0
it is an attempt to cheat a fellow professional and in that way is as bad as an over-the - top tackle			1
it seems impossible for a referee to make a 100 per cent accurate judgment in real time as to whether a player is diving — the @entity201 case at @entity202 , where he was wrongly booked , was a good illustration of that			0
equally , some players are getting away with it			0
there has been a lot of focus on refereeing standards in the @entity210 over the @entity181 period there should be a facility to review games on tv at the end of the weekend and then punish players or exonerate them retrospectively			1
that would also act as a deterrent to a player for whom diving is a part of the game			0
he might get away with it on the pitch , but the tv cameras would invariably catch him			0
but the other aspect of the game which i want to see stamped out would n’t need tv replays : it is players brandishing imaginary cards in an attempt to encourage the referee to book or send an opponent off			0
whenever that happens i think the referee should have the power to simply reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way			0
it would soon stop then			0
players brandishing imaginary cards to encourage the referee to book or send an opponent off needs to go as a player in the @entity249 , winning the @entity247 was as important as winning the league			0
in fact , some fans and players would prioritise it above the league			0
i was lucky enough to win finals , so it was a special tournament for me			0
last weekend we at @entity258 had a dreadful result against @entity261 but it again illustrated what an extraordinary competition it can be			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity264 hold up the @entity247 after beating @entity258 at @entity265 in 1982 last monday , as @entity267 contended with @entity54 , the game could have gone either way at 1 - 1			2
there were plenty of ties like that , with @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 all playing their part			0
it was a good weekend for the competition			0
the @entity247 might never be what it was but it is an important part of the football calendar and , bit by bit , is recovering its old glory			0
@entity267 contended with @entity54 in the @entity247 and the game could have gone either way at 1 - 1			2

@entity43 is relishing a ' match made in heaven ' with @entity44
the *34* - year - old will move to the @entity87 after this @entity210 *season*
but it 's a shame @entity43 did n't go abroad while he was at his peak
