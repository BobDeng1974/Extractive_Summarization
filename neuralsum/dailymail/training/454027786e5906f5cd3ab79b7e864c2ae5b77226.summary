mr @entity27 , who was also competing , heard about the collapse and ran four miles to the scene but arrived to find lt col @entity2 grey and cold			1
he had died about 20 minutes previously			1

at an inquest into the death held in @entity44 , @entity45 , mr @entity27 described his brother - in - law as an extremely talented man who was very ' humble ' about his achievements in life			2
recalling the day he died he said : ' it was about 16 degrees outside			2
a lovely temperature to be doing it			2
' i was going to be doing the support part of the run			0
every seven miles giving them painkillers , something to eat and drink and be on their way			2
' @entity62 was used to doing the run			0
he was the slowest person on the run , but made a point of being the slowest so he could literally bring up the rear			0
' i would imagine he was not even running			0
certainly the runner who was with him was more interested in sightseeing and taking photographs			0
lt col @entity2 , who worked as a spinal surgeon at @entity23 , @entity24 , had co-founded the event with wife @entity26 and brother - in - law @entity27 and had competed in it six times before ' he was @entity19 and with @entity62 when he collapsed			1
they had been having a conversation about the beautiful weather			0
' some of @entity62 's last words were that he said it was such a historically wonderful thing to do and the setting of the run itself would be enough to get people to do it			0
' it was such a beautiful run			0
to have that conversation suggests it he was n't really going for it			0
' he did not complain about having to stop and was chatting away and suddenly he collapsed			2
' the fireman , known as @entity94 from @entity95 , said @entity2 was gasping for breath and lost consciousness			1
despite his best efforts to perform cpr he died in his arms during the race aimed at raising awareness of the sacrifices made by allied soldiers			1
recording a verdict of natural death , @entity45 coroner @entity105 said : ' i would expect this disease in the heart of a 65 - year - old , not someone who is 45			1
' if your heart is going downhill and you use it more the worse it is going to get			2
' this is a degeneration and progressive change			0
' he had constant medical check ups with the @entity120 , which showed he was fine			0
' it is clearly an ongoing condition			0
it was not a heart attack this was a degeneration rather than a single event			1
' it is sad and very unexpected			0
