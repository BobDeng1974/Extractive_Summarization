@entity3 ‘ s extra-time double set up @entity1 ’s first competitive meeting with county rivals @entity2 in 27 years			1
full - back @entity3 scored twice , the second a superb 25 - yarder , to terminate @entity6 ’s three - month unbeaten run and book the fourth - round @entity7 tie with @entity10 ’s @entity9 promotion chasers later this month – their previous one came in the third tier of @entity14 football in 1988			1
stubborn @entity6 – whose previous defeat in any competition came way back on october 25 – were finally broken midway through the extra 30 minutes when a flowing @entity1 move instigated by winger @entity19 saw @entity20 slipped into the area and his square ball was guided in by @entity3 at the far post			1
@entity1 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity3 , @entity50 ( @entity51 91 ) , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 82 ) , @entity19 , @entity55 , @entity20 subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 goals : @entity3 105,116 bookings : @entity52 manager : @entity32 @entity6 : @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 48 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ( @entity74 94 ) , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 ( @entity78 56 ) subs not used : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 bookings : @entity66 , @entity71 manager : @entity36 referee : @entity87 att : 6815 @entity19 almost made it 3 - 0 with the final action of the night at the @entity90 but his howitzer of a free - kick crashed back off the crossbar			1
@entity32 ’s team , with one defeat in their previous 13 matches , began the resumption of the tie in the ascendancy having clawed back a two - goal deficit at @entity102 a week ago			0
but @entity45 kept the 1997 semi-finalists at bay for the opening 45 minutes with an array of fine saves and it appeared that @entity6 would be involved in another shoot - out – having beaten non-league @entity109 14 - 13 on penalties last month – before @entity3 had the final say			1
the @entity113 club could have been ahead inside the opening minute as a fast break culminated with right - back @entity47 ’s first - time shot at the far post being blocked by @entity6 goalkeeper @entity45			2
it was a busy evening for @entity45 despite the spoiling of @entity66 , in front of the back four			0
although it stemmed the waves of home attacks it could not still them altogether and @entity45 was forced to tip over an improvised dink from @entity20 , @entity128 ’s top scorer , and then repel a drive from @entity130 around an upright			0
@entity133 ’ visitors might have made them pay with their one clear - cut chance of the first half but @entity75 ’s attempted lob of @entity46 , following a ball over the top of the home defence , lacked precision			0
immediately after the break , @entity20 curled another effort just wide but @entity6 also threatened in a brief purple patch with @entity76 ’s shot on the hour searing agonizingly off - target			2
at the other end , the visiting defence remained resolute under increased pressure : @entity48 ’s improvised chested effort from a corner gleefully clutched by @entity45 who was then thankful to @entity52 ’s indecision when clear and @entity69 ’s stooping defensive header as the ball bobbled across the six - yard box			0
@entity6 are not beaten easily			2
in addition to their recent run , this time last year , under previous manager @entity156 they completed a club record 28 matches without defeat			0
but @entity3 ’ class told in the end			0
@entity1 's @entity19 ( left ) is sent flying under a challenge from @entity6 's @entity70 the @entity166 's striker @entity75 reacts after missing a chance to put his side ahead in the first half @entity1 boss @entity32 ( right ) barks orders from the touchline alongside @entity6 manager @entity36			1

@entity1 midfielder @entity3 scored two extra-time goals in their @entity7 third round replay with @entity6
the @entity29 near their *tournament* best of the fifth round by booking their place to face @entity2
@entity1 were @entity7 semi-finalists in 1997 but lost out to @entity181 in a replay
