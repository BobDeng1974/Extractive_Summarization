@entity0 will consider switching prolific @entity2 wing , @entity3 , into midfield for their autumn test opener against @entity6 , if @entity8 ’ shoulder injury rules him out			1
@entity9 has been in sensational form for @entity11 in the early stages of this season – touching down four times during saturday ’s 34 - 6 @entity16 demolition of the @entity17			2
that took his try tally to eight in as many matches , but the 22 - year - old may be asked to move from his preferred position out wide , as emergency cover			1
although @entity0 are hopeful that @entity26 and @entity27 could be fit to face the @entity6 , they will weigh up the option of unleashing @entity9 through the middle , as they did against the same opposition last year			1
‘ @entity3 went there ( centre ) last year against @entity6 , ’ said assistant coach @entity31			1
@entity3 scored four tries against @entity17 in the @entity16 match at @entity36 @entity8 injured his shoulder playing for @entity38 on the sunday and could miss the autumn tests ‘ we think @entity3 is n’t a bad outside centre			1
he did okay on the wing as well on the weekend , which was fantastic to see			2
he was back to his @entity2 form			2
it is an option for us if we need to go there			2
’ that scenario will be pondered once the extent of @entity8 ’ injury is known by head coach @entity51 and his assistants			1
initial reports in @entity54 – where the @entity2 centre plays for @entity38 – suggested he may have dislocated his shoulder during the first half of sunday ’s win over @entity60			1
@entity0 should have a clearer picture by tuesday			0
‘ @entity8 had a bump on his shoulder and we are uncertain as to the extent of the injury , ’ said @entity31			1
‘ a scan has been organised			2
he obviously felt some pain and came off immediately			0
it is disappointing , but centre is a pretty attritional position now			2
it ’s no different to other campaigns – we just have to get on and work with what we ’ve got			0
’ @entity26 and @entity27 arrived in camp with hamstring and leg injuries respectively , but the @entity0 management believe they could be ready for the start of the autumn campaign			0
‘ @entity26 and @entity27 could potentially be fit for next week , ’ said @entity31			0
head coach @entity51 has seen a number of his 34 - man squad for the autumn tests complain of injuries wales are hopeful that @entity84 centre @entity26 could be fit to face @entity6 meanwhile , the @entity6 are prepared to summon controversial back @entity85 to join their tour providing he proves his fitness – despite his latest disciplinary episode			1
the @entity91 player was suspended and then fined after being found guilty of sending an offensive text about a former member of the team ’s back - room staff			0
yet , it appears @entity85 once again has been forgiven by @entity6 and will be reintegrated soon			1
‘ @entity85 is back at home training , ’ said defence coach , @entity97			0
‘ he has n’t played for a long time			0
we know he ’s working hard , trying to get back up to speed with his physical condition and once he ’s done that he will definitely be considered for selection			0
he could possibly join us on this tour once he gets back in shape			0
’ @entity106 fly - half @entity104 expects to make a test comeback against the @entity108 on saturday – putting him on course to face @entity110 at @entity111 a week later , after a year decimated by injuries			1
‘ i ’m preparing to play that game , ’ he said , of the sell - out fixture in @entity114			0
‘ i ’m confident and the medical team are confident that i ’ll be able to be selected			0
that ’s what we ’re targeting			0
’ @entity6 fly half and full back @entity85 could be called into @entity6 's squad if he proves his fitness @entity85 slips as he fails to kick a penalty against the @entity2 in the first test in june 2013			1

first choice centre @entity8 injured himself playing for @entity38 against @entity128 on sunday
he will have a scan on his shoulder to determine the extent of the injury
@entity3 was used in the centres against @entity6 last year
@entity51 's side face @entity6 on *november* 8
