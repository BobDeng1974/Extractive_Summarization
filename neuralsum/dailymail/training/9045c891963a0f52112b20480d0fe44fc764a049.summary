by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 , his bling twinkling in the flash bulbs , summoned the @entity6 man to hand him his phone			1
@entity2 turned round to take a ‘ selfie ’ with the @entity14 press conference throng , adopting the nonchalant air of a man without a care			1
@entity16 sat on the other side of the front row , his arms firmly folded			1
@entity19 was sandwiched between them — just in case			0
@entity2 , it seemed , enjoyed holding the psychological edge over his title rival who has apologised for the crash , paid a six - figure fine to his @entity6 team for causing it and been reduced in the estimation of many for his perceived utter ruthlessness			1
it was an all the more welcome feeling for @entity2 because he has lost virtually every mind - game of the season to the usually ice - veined @entity16 , who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points			1
spa break : the two drivers came together in @entity31 , @entity16 admitted the crash was his error momentum , mechanical luck and championship points have all drained away from the @entity59 driver since he won in @entity60 in mid-may , when @entity6 chairman @entity61 proved himself to be the @entity62 by hailing @entity2 as ‘ unbeatable ’			1
since the @entity65 fracas , there has been a frank meeting of the squabbling protagonists and the @entity6 management at the team ’s @entity70 factory			2
but a truce is not a peace			0
as if to prove all is not right , a smile played across each of their lips at a point when the other was in a slight fix			0
it was @entity16 ’s turn when @entity2 was asked if he had been penalised for ignoring a team order to let the @entity84 through during the previous race in @entity86			1
rivals : the pair have endured a tense relationship all season , but it has deteriorated in recent months he took an age to answer			0
‘ um … well , i do n’t really know , ’ he finally ventured			0
‘ we always get a big slap on the wrist			0
’ @entity6 later said @entity2 was not fined , but the matter was discussed			1
@entity2 ’s moment to smirk came when he was asked if the @entity98 should have investigated the crash at @entity65 ? ‘ i think it ’s a really good question , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n’t know the full answer to that really			0
’ again and again we were left to decipher the code			0
@entity2 was asked if trust had been restored			1
‘ trust is a big word and it ’s not something i would particularly apply to racing , ’ he said			0
‘ naturally , @entity16 and i have been racing for a long time and i think we set a good foundation a long , long time ago			2
’ drivers ' standings : @entity16 is currently leading the championship , while team - mate @entity2 is second decoded that reads : ‘ i do n’t trust him an inch			1
i have known him and his knavish tricks since we were boys			0
’ did @entity2 now see the crash as nothing more than a racing incident ? ‘ what has happened in the past is in the past			1
’ decoded : ‘ no , he meant to do it and has had his comeuppance			0
’ although some @entity2 fans will be horrified by the suggestion , it was a minor incident brought about by the two men racing hard			2
@entity16 pushed an inch or two too far			2
he certainly did not deserve boos on the podium in @entity65			0
‘ it was not a nice feeling , ’ said the @entity84			0
‘ i understand because they travelled a long way to watch a big battle between @entity2 and me , and they did n’t get that			2
’ @entity141 was called after half an hour			0
@entity16 , last out of the room , gave @entity2 plenty of space as they left			1
@entity146 looks forward to ' bellissimo ' @entity22 gp			2
