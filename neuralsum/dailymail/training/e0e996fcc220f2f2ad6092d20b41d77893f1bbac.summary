by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:20 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 21:33 est , 21 august 2012 blow : @entity4 's austerity policies have again been called into question after public borrowing rose last month @entity4 is drawing up plans for ‘ nuclear ’ spending cuts this autumn after ‘ terrible ’ borrowing figures showed the country has plunged deeper into the red			1
the chancellor has resisted calls to draw up a @entity14 for the economy , but senior civil servants say the government is working on ‘ @entity18 ’ to prevent a multi-billion - pound black hole opening in the public finances			1
official figures showed the government borrowed £ 557million last month as a dramatic slump in tax receipts and a surge in spending on benefits punctured the chancellor ’s economic plans			1
the grim news sent shockwaves through the @entity31 and @entity32 , where experts had predicted a surplus of £ 2.5billion			1
the national debt soared to £ 1.03trillion – or more than £ 41,000 per household – compared to £ 940billion a year ago and less than £ 400billion a decade ago			1
senior @entity38 officials admitted that could mean further spending cuts in november ’s autumn statement			2
mr @entity4 is planning to announce a major housebuilding programme when @entity43 returns next month			2
as well , the government may reform the @entity45 so it can borrow money to spend on roads , boosting the economy and reducing congestion			1
the agency , which runs the network of motorways and a-roads , could be made a government - owned company or public trust , allowing it to borrow large amounts without increasing the public deficit			1
earlier this year the government suggested plans to privatise roads , creating new tolls roads and ‘ @entity62 lanes ’ , where wealthy motorists can pay to beat jams			1
@entity66 officials say the @entity38 has told government departments to prepare a fresh round of savings			1
one senior civil servant said : ‘ the ideas being kicked around are the kind of unmentionable economies that would make your eyes water			2
‘ the @entity38 is reaching for the nuclear bunker plans to deal with a liquidity crisis			2
there simply is n’t enough money coming in			2
‘ you will see the kind of cuts that they have had to push through in @entity85 and @entity86			2
nothing is off the table			0
‘ this is n’t @entity14 we already have a @entity14 and it is n’t working			0
that was to get the banks lending and move on big infrastructure projects			0
now we ’re into @entity94 territory , which means more retrenchment			0
’ staying the course : the @entity38 said today it must stick to its guns on cuts but critics have called on the chancellor to adopt a plan b senior @entity38 officials say the full picture wo n’t be clear until october , when the independent @entity104 delivers a critical ruling that will determine whether the @entity38 has to borrow billions more or take an axe to public spending			1
a source close to mr @entity4 said : ‘ we wo n’t know the full situation until october ’ , and added : ‘ the @entity38 always prepares contingency plans			0
’ in a fresh blow to mr @entity4 a new @entity113 poll for @entity114 showed confidence in the chancellor at an all - time low			0
just 16 per cent of voters trust him to see the country through the current crisis against 62 per cent who do not trust him			0
yesterday ’s figures also provoked a renewed bout of sniping from @entity126 , many of whom want to see the chancellor change course			1
@entity130 , the party ’s former @entity38 spokesman in the @entity132 , called on the government to stimulate the economy with ‘ two real big bazookas ’ – a housebuilding programme and measures to get banks lending again			1
he said : ‘ i ’m afraid just firing off scattergun shots at the target wo n’t work			0
we are in danger of slipping down into a sort of vicious cycle , whereby no growth then means the deficit gets worse , then people talk about cutting again			0
that really would be self - harm			0
’ yesterday ’s figures were particularly worrying because july is usually a bumper month for the public finances – there was a surplus of £ 2.8billion last year , meaning the state repaid rather than borrowed money			1
but tax receipts were 0.8 per cent lower than a year earlier while government spending rose 5.1 per cent			1
benefits payments jumped 6.2 per cent			0
and in another blow to ministers , the @entity158 blasted the ‘ ineffective ’ government			2
economist @entity162 said : ‘ business is battening down the hatches in the expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year			0
low confidence leads to delayed decisions , and delayed decisions further undermine economic confidence – it ’s a vicious cycle			0
‘ if the @entity174 wants to break this cycle of low economic confidence , then they need to take some bold steps			0
’ @entity38 spokesman @entity178 said : ‘ this is a damning indictment of a chancellor who promised to secure the recovery and get the deficit down			0
his failed plan has delivered the exact opposite			0
’ a @entity38 spokesman said : ‘ the government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with @entity191 ’s debts			1

official figures show rise in borrowing in july *unexpectedly* rose *sharply*
government had hoped to pay off £ 2.5bn of debt but instead it needed £ 600m more
public sector net debt hits £ 1 trillion , *65* *%* of the @entity191 's *gdp*
