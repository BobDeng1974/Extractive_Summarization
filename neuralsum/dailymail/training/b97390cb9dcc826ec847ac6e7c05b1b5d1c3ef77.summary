for the past days and nights , they had waited in this great city in the rain			0
swathed in pale blue and white , they had waited for their little genius to take the next natural step forward , waited for him to bring the greatest trophy home across the border			2
@entity11 was ready , after all			1
he had achieved everything else over these past years			0
and , during a compelling month in enemy territory , he had brought @entity14 to this final almost on his own			1
but not all stories end the way they might and last night @entity14 's captain could not put his signature to the final chapter			1
he had the opportunity , too			0
that is what will haunt him			0
it was a proper opportunity too , the type he consumes without blinking for @entity49			1
played in down the inside left channel by @entity51 , @entity11 suddenly had green space ahead of him			2
when he is operating at his instinctive best , these chances fly past goalkeepers so fast they hardly hear them , never mind see them			0
top corner , near post , is usually a decent bet			0
here , though , @entity11 dragged his shot across the goal and wide			2
the replays made it look better than it was			0
it lacked conviction and it was never going in			0
a goal then and a strangely introverted @entity68 side may not have recovered			0
as it was , the @entity69 hauled themselves to extra-time and , once they were there , the reserves of energy afforded them by a semi-final stroll against @entity76 became apparent			1
@entity11 ’s own father had actually expressed doubts about his son ’s ability to maintain a persistent threat deep in to this tournament			1
according to @entity84 , his boy had been feeling heavy - legged			2
carbon copy : @entity11 and @entity86 ( @entity87 ) were both given special attention at @entity89 where did it all go wrong ? @entity11 's missed opportunity will likely haunt him for the rest of his days marked man : @entity11 surrounded by four @entity68 players as he breaks forward jinking run : the @entity49 eludes defenders to get in a dangerous cross during the first - half @entity101 bargy : @entity11 shrugs off a challenge from @entity104 midfielder @entity103 slipping away : @entity11 reacts to a missed opportunity as the game heads towards extra-time unsurprisingly , there was little sign of that last night during regulation play			1
@entity36 finals have a habit of providing adrenaline surges			2
beyond that and in to extra-time , though , the 27 - year - old began to feel the effects of the great weight he has carried here over the last four weeks , namely his nation 's hopes , and an extended semi-final against @entity123 last wednesday			1
on the way to the stadium here yesterday , the @entity14 supporters crammed on to @entity129 's metro system and sang songs in his honour			1
this , they felt sure , was to be his night , the occasion he gave tangible credence to their claims that @entity138 produces better footballers than @entity76			1
one on one : @entity11 closes in on @entity141 's ( @entity87 ) goal as he tries to break the first - half deadlock pinball : the ball ricochets away from goal after @entity11 feeds @entity146 ( bottom @entity147 ) someone tell him ... @entity149 celebrated wildly before realising his goal had been disallowed at times , he looked as though he may produce as his performance fitted with the narrative of his tournament			1
his moments of recognisable genius were fleeting but they were still there			0
the skip to the by - line past @entity159 early on was from the classic @entity11 play book , so was the imperious pass he played out to @entity146 not long after			1
the cross that followed was side - footed in by @entity163 , but he was offside			2
there were other moments , too , times when the burners came on and he accelerated past white shirts			0
in extra-time , though , @entity11 ’s influence receded			1
early in the added period he should have been at the far post to convert a low cross from @entity172			0
@entity172 was playing as a substitute , though , and @entity11 was not			2
by that time his race was run and he was not alone			0
moment of truth : @entity176 scores the winner for @entity35 in extra-time to win the @entity36 @entity68 engineering : @entity176 and @entity180 wheel away after bringing the @entity36 to @entity69 scant consolation : the @entity182 was awarded the @entity184 trophy for player of the tournament @entity138 woe at it 's capital reacts earlier on in the day , @entity11 had emerged from the team bus looking a little uncomfortable , a little cowed			1
it appeared , just momentarily , as though expectation hung heavy			2
four hours later his final act of the day was to trudge sombrely to the presentation platform twice , once to accept the @entity184 and once his loser ’s medal			2
only @entity196 could put a losing finalist through that and not once did his expression change			0
he place in the pantheon remains , of course			0
he does n’t need a @entity36 winner ’s medal for that and it should be remembered that this is some way from a great @entity138 team			1
victory here would have put him in the elite company of his some of his heroes , though			0
his chance may not come again			0
tale of the tape : @entity11 failed top do what @entity86 achieved ... win the @entity36 single - handedly			1

@entity35 defeated @entity138 1 - 0 in extra-time to win the @entity36
@entity11 had the weight of expectation of an entire nation on him
@entity49 forward has a superb chance to open the scoring but missed it
@entity176 eventually scored the winner in the second - half of extra-time
even @entity11 's father had doubts his son would maintain a threat throughout the tournament in @entity76
the @entity14 talisman did win the @entity184 award for best player
