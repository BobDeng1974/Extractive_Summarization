the one thing you can count on at @entity2 – according to its bosses – is that everything costs £ 1			1
and now the budget retailer has been told it must drop that claim after selling dvds and cds for £ 2			2
today ’s ruling by the @entity11 is a major blow for the company , which has built its empire on the boast that just £ 1 can buy anything in its stores			1
@entity2 has been told it must drop the claim ' everything costs £ 1 ' after selling dvds and cds for £ 2 the decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself ‘ @entity2 ’			1
before the advertising watchdog ’s ruling , @entity2 's website boasted : ‘ everything for £ 1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we ’re still true to that vision today			1
’ under a heading ‘ our values ’ , it added : ‘ we ’ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the @entity34 ... we are very proud to offer you a single £ 1 price , that has n’t changed since we opened our first store			2
’ however , people complained to the @entity11 that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking dvds of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for £ 2 each			2
@entity2 defended the breaking of its normal £ 1 price barrier saying the £ 2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold			1
the @entity11 said : ‘ they stated that an average @entity2 store stocked approximately 4,000 products and that the ‘ conditional spend ’ promotion was created in response to consumer demand			0
@entity2 has become hugely popular with wealthier shoppers after stocking baking products under the name of actress @entity64 ‘ in october 2014 , @entity2 obtained feedback from consumers regarding the promotion and found that a significant proportion agreed that they would buy items from @entity2 that cost more than £ 1 , provided they were clearly marked and located in a special place in the shop			1
’ the company said the stock of £ 2 dvds and cds were on a specific display that was separated from the normal £ 1 products and there was no chance of shoppers being confused or misled			1
but that did not satisfy the @entity11 , which said the claims on the @entity2 website suggested that all its products were no more than £ 1 ‘ regardless of whether or not they were sold via a concession arrangement or as promotional goods ’			1
it added : ‘ because that was not the case , we concluded that the ad was misleading			0
’ significantly , the @entity11 said : ‘ we told @entity2 that their future advertising must not state or suggest that every item they sold cost £ 1			2
’ if this ruling sticks , it will be a heavy blow to one of @entity34 ’s fastest growing retailers			0
the company recently announced a plan to spend £ 55million to take over its deadly rival the 99p stores chain , which will add some 251 outlets to an existing empire of 534 stores			0
the company , which floated on the @entity108 last year , is worth almost £ 1billion and has become a fixture on many high streets , taking over outlets once occupied by the failed giant @entity112			0
it was shunned by the middle classes , at one time , but it is now hugely popular after making a concerted effort to attract wealthier shoppers with baking products under the name of cake maker and actress @entity64 , a range of well received beauty products as well as gardening and @entity125 items			0
@entity2 is not the first discount store to fall foul of the @entity11			0
last october , the watchdog issued a similar ban on claims made by the @entity132 chain			0
the company was told to stop claiming everything costs £ 1 after it was found selling more expensive products under the heading ‘ manager specials ’			2
these included packs of 100 finish all - in - one dishwasher tablets for £ 8.99 , £ 3 for 10 cans of cola and £ 5.99 for a @entity143 gift set			0
@entity2 confirmed some ‘ special promotion ’ items cost more than £ 1			1
currently , it is selling an @entity148 toy and a @entity149 for £ 3 to customers who spend £ 3			1
the firm said it has changed its website claims following the @entity11 ruling			0
a spokesman said : ‘ following advice from the @entity11 on the communication of our special promotions on the @entity2 website , we have amended the site and made the special promotions clearer			1
‘ @entity2 sells over 4,000 products at £ 1 , including over 1,000 well - known brands and we are proud of the amazing value we offer , to over 5.5 million customers every week			2
‘ our special promotions have been bought by nearly one million customers , and are an additional offer separate to our usual product lines for customers who qualify , by spending £ 3 or more in - store			1
' these items can not be bought separately			0
customer feedback has been outstanding			0

advertising watchdog ruled @entity2 must drop claim everything is £ 1
it is a major blow to company which built entire business around notion

@entity2 defended breaking price barrier if it 's part of special promotion
currently store has an @entity148 toy and @entity149 for £ 3 deal
