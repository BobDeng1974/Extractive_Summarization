by @entity0 whether you ’re rowing your boat , winding the bobbin up or doing the @entity4 , having a little boogie with your baby can do more than just entertain them , according to research			0
the new study has found that moving in sync with your tot can actually turn them into more helpful children			1
bouncing at the same time to music with 14 - month - old babies encourages them to display altruistic behaviour , the study from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , found			1
bouncing in unison with your baby can encourage them to be more helpful little beings , the study found @entity26 , lead author of the new paper , due to be published in an upcoming issue of the @entity29 , said : ' ‘ movement is a fundamental part of music that affects social behaviour from a very young age			1
' @entity26 , and her colleagues in the department of psychology , neuroscience and behaviour , showed that 14 - month - old babies were much more likely to help an adult person after the experience of bouncing up and down in time to music with them			2
bounce in sync with your baby and reap the rewards of their helpful behaviour @entity26 and fellow doctoral student @entity49 tested 68 babies , many of whom could not yet walk , to see if bouncing to music with another person made them more likely to assist that person			1
some babies were bounced in sync with a researcher standing opposite them while others were bounced at a different tempo			0
when the song was over , the researcher performed several simple tasks , including drawing a picture with a marker			0
while drawing she would pretend to drop the marker to see whether the infant would pick it up and hand it back to her – a test of altruism in babies			2
the babies who had been bounced in time with the researcher were much more likely to toddle over , pick up the object and pass it back to the researcher , compared to infants who had been bounced at a different tempo			0
the findings suggest that when we sing , clap , bounce or dance in time to music with our babies , these shared experiences of synchronous movement help form social bonds between adults and babies .			0

study was *carried* out at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17
found bouncing in unison with babies encouraged them to be helpful
researchers ' *accidentally* ' dropped objects to see whether the tots retrieved them and handed them back to test altruistic behaviour
