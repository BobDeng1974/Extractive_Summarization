by @entity0 published : 03:50 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 4 april 2013 schoolgirl @entity2 ’s hiccups started on a normal day in january when she was on her way to a maths lesson			1
but the 13 - year - old has not been able to stop since , hiccuping every two seconds , even when she is asleep			1
experts are baffled by her rare condition and have n’t yet been able to find a cure			1
she has had an mri scan , ultrasound scan , chest x-ray , endoscopy , biopsies , a nasal chute to measure her ph levels , and a gastric emptying study			2
doctors have prescribed a variety of different drugs , which have n't worked and she has tried osteopathy and hypnosis			1
the schoolgirl has tried every home - made remedy , from a spoonful of vinegar to holding her breath and is so desperate that she is about to have a go at acupuncture and has appointments to see an audiologist and tic doctor			1
she finds it so exhausting she 's been given afternoons off school to rest			1
‘ we are willing to try anything , ’ said her mother @entity48 , 45 , a charity worker from @entity49 , @entity19			2
‘ it 's been 10 weeks now , and a very long 10 weeks at that			1
@entity2 is exhausted by it all but she 's taking it in her stride			1
concern : @entity58 and sisters @entity60 15 ( left ) and @entity61 10 ( right ) have been worried about @entity2 's condition ‘ it makes her throat very sore but she deals with it very well			1
the thing that frustrates her is this constant tired feeling			2
‘ strangers are forever offering her a glass of water			0
but school have been very understanding			1
’ @entity2 is one of only a handful of young people known to have had sustained chronic hiccups			1
she can only manage half a day at @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity19 , because the constant movement is not only painful but exhausting			1
@entity2 said : ' i have tried everything - even the spoonful of vinegar			1
that was horrible - i refused to do it again			1
‘ i 've tried drinking backwards , holding my breath and people at school have been trying to scare me a lot			1
’ the hiccups - an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm - become minimal when @entity2 is in a deep sleep , but return at full force as soon as she enters a lighter sleep			1
exhausted : @entity2 has been given afternoons off school as her condition leaves her so tired she is currently being treated with two drugs - domperidone , an anti-nausea medicine , and omeprazole , used to treat gastro - oesophageal reflux disease			1
@entity58 added : ‘ absolutely nothing has worked			0
we have tried hypnotherapy and osteopathy but we are now completely running out of ideas			0
‘ she 's just got to the stage where she 's just fed up and wants them to go			0
i can understand - if you have hiccups for 10 - 15 minutes it 's horrible			1
‘ we believe that someone somewhere must be able to help or come up with a solution			0
’ she said @entity2 had never had health problems dr @entity116 the paediatric consultant looking after @entity2 at @entity119 's @entity118 at @entity17 , said they had tried a string of tests on @entity2 including an mri scan , blood tests and extensive assessments of her stomach			1
hiccups that last more than 48 hours can be categorised into : - @entity128 or protracted hiccups - a bout of hiccups that lasts for more than 48 hours - intractable hiccups - a bout of hiccups that lasts longer than a month hiccups are common and most people will get them at some point during their life			2
they can affect people of any age , including babies			0
men and women are equally affected by episodes of short - lived hiccups			2
however , for reasons that are unclear , persistent and intractable hiccups are more common in men			0
intractable hiccups are more common in adults			0
these types of hiccups can be tiring and upsetting , and can make eating and drinking difficult			0
persistent and intractable hiccups are rare and usually caused by another underlying health condition			2
in 80 % of cases of persistent or intractable hiccups , a cause can be identified			0
the remaining 20 % of cases usually have a psychological cause			0
most hiccups will pass quickly and usually only last a few minutes			0
treatment is not usually required			0
however , in cases of persistent or intractable hiccups that last longer than 48 hours , further investigations are needed to identify the cause and appropriate treatment			0
as well as treatment for underlying conditions , there are also self - help techniques that may help some people to stop common types of hiccups			2
www.nhs.uk however , all the tests have proved inconclusive			0
other medical problems have been known to cause chronic hiccuping , but doctors have so far been unable to find anything wrong with @entity2 and have ruled out serious medical conditions			1
dr @entity116 said : ‘ this condition is very rare and it is frustrating for @entity2 and her family			1
we are doing everything we can , working with our colleagues and closely with the family , to try and find an answer to this young girl 's hiccups			2
’ @entity58 said the problem was medication known to have worked on adults can not be used on @entity2 because it is not suitable for children			1
one drug she has already tried - @entity192 - left her ill in hospital for a week			2
@entity58 said a young @entity195 girl had created a ' hiccupop ' which she believes will stop hiccups as it worked for her but it had yet to be released for public sale			0
she praised @entity17 , @entity75 and the @entity200 who are all providing help to the youngster			0
other cases of people to have had chronic hiccuping include an @entity195 man , @entity207 , who is in the @entity208 after having hiccups for 68 years from 1922 to 1990 - when they mysteriously stopped			2
in 2010 a musician resorted to brain surgery after hiccuping an estimated 20million times over several years			0
@entity213 , 26 , from @entity214 , @entity215 , suffered his first hiccuping attack in september 2006			0
it halted after a fortnight , then returned in february 2007 , becoming as frequent as every two seconds , 24 hours a day			2
the normal remedies all failed , including hundreds of different ways of drinking water and eating a teaspoon of peanut butter , medical schemes including an oxygen chamber and alternative therapies such as yoga and hypnotherapy			0
finally he appealed for help on the internet and was flown by a @entity233 tv station to see a @entity235 hiccup specialist who found a tumour the size of a @entity238 on his brain stem			0
following an operation to remove it , mr @entity213 believed he was cured but as a result of the dangerous operation suffered numbness down his left side and now has difficulty with co-ordination which he was warned could last for years .			0

@entity2 has hiccuped every two seconds for ten weeks
given afternoons off school as the condition is so painful and exhausting
experts are baffled as they can not find a cure for the condition
drugs that normally help sufferers are too strong for the 13 - year - old
