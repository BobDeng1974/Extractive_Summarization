by @entity0 published : 11:38 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 12:35 est , 21 may 2013 tragedy : experienced maintenance engineer @entity2 died after being crushed by the 145 - tonne metal press defence giant @entity4 has been ordered to pay almost £ 350,000 in compensation after a worker died when he was crushed by a 145 - tonne metal press at one of its sites			1
experienced maintenance engineer @entity2 , 51 , from @entity11 , was part of a team of four men performing a routine service on the machine when the tragedy occured			1
@entity11 @entity18 heard how mr @entity2 entered the press , which was the size of a two - bedroom house , to remove a piece of equipment			1
a the same time , a colleague at the other end started a full test cycle , unaware that he was inside			1
mr @entity2 was trapped by the 45 square metre frame as it descended and he died the same day in hospital from crush injuries			1
his death at the @entity4 plant at @entity32 , @entity33 , in november 2008 was described as an ' entirely preventable tragedy ' by the @entity35			1
an investigation exposed a series of flaws in safety practices during maintenance of the metal press , which was used to make components for @entity44 jets , some of which had existed for many years			2
failings included a lack of a suitable risk assessments and control measures to prevent workers entering dangerous parts of the machine during testing or to stop the machine if anyone did enter a danger zone			0
@entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , was fined £ 250,000 and ordered to pay £ 97,153 costs after pleading guilty to a breach of section 2 ( 1 ) of the @entity65 etc @entity66			0
the company had entered a guilty plea at a hearing last year			2
after the hearing , @entity35 inspector @entity70 said : ' this was an entirely preventable tragedy that devastated mr @entity2 ’s wife , @entity75 , his two children and his wider family			1
' they have shown admirable resilience during what has been a protracted and , at times painful , process			0
risks : @entity2 , 51 , was servicing this metal press at the @entity4 plant when his colleague set it onto a full test cycle , unaware that he was inside retrieving a piece of equipment ' the dangers of maintenance work on these types of machines are well - known yet @entity4 failed to identify those risks and its serious failings led to this tragedy			1
' although the press machine had been serviced regularly , it was done in the same unacceptable way and it is surprising there had not been an earlier incident			2
' the guarding was inadequate and there were no key safety systems , no light guards or interlocks on the doors of the machine ; nothing that would have either prevented entry to dangerous parts or stopped the machine if entry was made			0
' in addition , there were no instructions , either written or verbal , given by @entity4 to workers about how to carry out the testing process safely			0
' this incident should serve as a reminder to companies to ensure that dangerous parts of their machines are identified and measures taken to properly protect their workers			0
' no company should put its employees at unnecessary risk			0
' a statement released on behalf of mr @entity2 ’s widow , @entity75 , two children and brother , said : ' we are pleased that , more than four - and - a - half years after @entity2 was killed , @entity4 have been brought to justice			2
' the complete absence of any safe system of work for the job @entity2 was performing beggars belief			2
“ there was n’t a suitable risk assessment for the job he was doing			0
the accident happened at the @entity4 plant in @entity32 , @entity33 ' the machine he had been working in had been operated with a person inside it before and it is pure luck no - one was killed in the machine before @entity2			1
' if @entity4 had spent even a relatively small amount on safety features for the machine he was working in , @entity2 would have been alive today			1
' the statement said : ' @entity2 shone as a light in all of our lives , and the lives of all those who knew him			0
' @entity2 had the most infectious smile			0
he was always full of life , fun and energy , and was a devoted , loving husband , dad , granddad and brother			0
' @entity2 is missed terribly			0
the loss to us is unbelievable , we struggle without him , but life goes on and he will never ever be forgotten			0
' in a statement , the @entity4 said : ' @entity4 deeply regrets the death of its employee and colleague , @entity2 , in november 2008			1
' @entity4 appreciates the anguish this accident has caused and will continue to cause to @entity2 's family , friends and colleagues and for that @entity4 sincerely apologises			1
' the accident at @entity185 site , which claimed @entity2 's life , has been the subject of comprehensive and in - depth investigations , both by @entity4 and by the @entity35			1
@entity4 has co-operated fully with the @entity35 in its investigation throughout			2
' the company said the incident was an ' isolated failure at a site that generally has an excellent health and safety record ' and said it pleaded guilty after acknowledging there was a flaw in its safety procedures			2
