by @entity0 , defence correspondent published : 19:36 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 03:28 est , 31 january 2014 @entity2 yesterday cited the success of fictional television spies as a reason for reviving the controversial ‘ snoopers ’ charter ’			2
the prime minister said he wanted to resurrect plans to allow the police and security services to eavesdrop on the public ’s internet and mobile phone use			1
the contentious legislation was dropped last year amid a storm of protest from civil liberties groups and the @entity19			0
but i saw it on tv : the prime minister cited fictional spies in his appearance before the @entity26 on @entity27 yesterday , prompting anger from backbench @entity30 @entity29 did i just say that ? @entity2 was defending proposed new powers for spies to search through e-mails mr @entity2 said : ' ¿ in the most serious crimes [ such as ] child abduction , communications data ... is absolutely vital ¿ who called who and when , and where was the telephone at the time			1
not the content , but the data ' but in an extraordinary intervention , mr @entity2 pledged to introduce ‘ essential ’ new laws after watching tv shows @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 @entity49 spin - off elementary			1
the award - winning - but fictional - tv crime dramas all portray police and intelligence officers using communications data to catch villains			1
life imitates art : mr @entity2 may have been inspired by @entity48 , pictured he told a parliamentary security committee that monitoring private information was essential to keep citizens safe from terrorist attack and serious criminals			1
he said : ‘ in the most serious crimes [ such as ] child abduction , communications data ... is absolutely vital – who called who and when , and where was the telephone at the time			1
not the content , but the communications data			0
‘ i love watching crime dramas on the television			1
there ’s hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device			1
’ ‘ we have to explain to people is that ... if we do n’t modernise the practice and the law , over time we will have the communications data to solve these horrible crimes on a shrinking proportion of the total use of devices and that is a real problem for keeping people safe			2
‘ everybody raises questions about who has access to my data and why but i ’m absolutely convinced that proper rules for communications data is essential			0
’ but mr @entity2 faced ridicule , including from those in his own party			0
@entity30 mp @entity29 , who has opposed the snoopers ’ charter , said : ‘ sadly , you ca n’t derive policy from watching fictional crime dramas on tv			1
policy should be made using hard evidence , strong arguments and proper data , not the exploits of fictional crime fighters			1
’ @entity19 chairman @entity114 said : ‘ serious policies should be based on evidence , and after to listening to experts , and not based on what you saw on @entity48			0
’ information superhighway : data analysis features heavily in tv shows like @entity47 , pictured and @entity122 , of @entity123 , said the proposed snoopers ’ charter would have put every citizen under surveillance ‘ in a way that the @entity129 now acknowledges went too far ’			2
she added : ' these are very complex issues with enormous implications for privacy			0
perhaps the prime minister should read president @entity135 ’s independent surveillance review rather than relying on television programmes			2
' during an appearance before mps and peers on the @entity140 , mr @entity2 acknowledged that reviving the unpopular legislation was ‘ contentious ’			0
the new security @entity142 , which would have forced internet companies to store for a year details of all @entity145 ’ online activity , was blocked last year by deputy prime minister @entity147			0
but mr @entity2 believes action is still needed to reflect the fact criminals are increasingly using internet phone calls or social media sites such as @entity152 and @entity153 to communicate			0
grilling : mr @entity2 gave evidence yesterday to the committee , chaired by @entity157 's @entity156 the police can already tell when , where and who made a mobile phone call or sent a text message			2
but they can not always trace the origin of an email , a message sent via instant messaging or a phone call made over the internet			0
revelations by @entity50 whistleblower @entity171 , who lifted the lid on the scale of @entity175 ’s role with @entity50 ’s @entity176 in monitoring electronic communications around the world , have also seen demands for the law drop down the agenda .			0

' there ’s hardly a [ tv ] crime solved without using ... a mobile ' , @entity183 *claimed*
but his appearance before parliamentary security committee was *mocked*
