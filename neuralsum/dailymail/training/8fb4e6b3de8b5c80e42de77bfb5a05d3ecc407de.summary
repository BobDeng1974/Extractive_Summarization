by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 05:44 est , 11 january 2013 they have danced around the moon for almost a year , making detailed maps of its interior			2
flying in formation over the lunar surface , the two @entity7 probes - named @entity8 - helped further our understanding of the early solar system			1
but monday , in a dramatic climax to their mission , the two spacecraft plunged seconds apart into a mountain near the moon 's @entity19			2
afterward , @entity7 said it had dedicated the impact site in honor of mission team member , @entity23 , the first @entity24 woman in space who died earlier this year			1
mapping the moon : using a precision formation - flying technique , the twin grail spacecraft -- @entity8 -- have mapped the @entity42 's gravity field , as depicted in this artist 's rendering			2
by design , the spot was far away from the @entity48 landings and other historical sites			0
with their fuel running low , @entity7 was keen to prevent them from crashing near the historically important @entity48 landing sites			1
honoring : @entity7 said it had dedicated the impact site in honor of mission team member , @entity23 , the first @entity24 woman in space who died earlier this year and even the keenest stargazer would not have spotted the two - washing machine sized probes as they impacted at a speed of 3,800mph , as the collisions occurred on the dark side of moon			1
but @entity7 's @entity66 which circles the moon will soon be passing over the site and will attempt to photograph the skid marks after the craft slammed into the surface			2
the mission , codenamed @entity73 - was launched in september 2011 from @entity74 and has been deemed a success			1
the twin craft collected data about the moon 's gravity while orbiting at an average altitude of 34 miles , revealing its surface is much thinner than previously thought , gouged out by the impact of thousands of asteroids and comets			2
' it is going to be difficult to say goodbye to our little robotic twins , ' says @entity89 professor @entity88 , grail principal investigator			0
' planetary science has advanced in a major way because of their contributions			0
' @entity8 conducted one final experiment before their mission ends , firing their main engines until their propellant tanks are empty in a bid to determine precisely the amount of fuel left in their tanks			1
@entity7 engineers hope this information will help improve predictions of fuel needs for future missions			2
' our lunar twins may be in the twilight of their operational lives , but one thing is for sure , they are going down swinging , ' said grail project manager @entity115 of @entity7 's @entity116 in @entity117			0
trajectory : the twin lunar - orbiting @entity7 spacecrafts went on a controlled crash into a site named after @entity23 crash landing site : the map shows the region where the twin spacecraft of @entity7 's @entity36 mission will impact on monday a successful mission : the map created by @entity8 has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , suggesting the moon , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
blast off : the $ 496 million grail mission - short for @entity36 - launched in september 2011 , and @entity8 reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later			1
' even during the last half of their last orbit , we are going to do an engineering experiment that could help future missions operate more efficiently			0
' the twin craft focused exclusively on measuring the moon 's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history			0
' after flying in formation for months , they produced the most detailed gravity maps of any body in the solar system			0
since the dawn of the @entity157 , more than 100 missions have involved the moon , including @entity7 's six @entity48 landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface			0
the last time the @entity24 space agency intentionally fired a man - made object at the moon was in 2009 , but it was for the sake of science			1
spectators on @entity132 barely saw the faintest of flashes , but the experiment proved that the moon contained water			1
' grail has produced the highest - resolution , highest - quality gravity field for any planet in the solar system , including @entity132 , ' @entity88 reportedly said			1
the resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust , @entity88 added , suggesting that the moon , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 were pounded by long - ago impacts far more violently than previously thought			1
mission managers on friday turned off @entity8 's science instruments and ordered a maneuver putting them on course for the rim of the crater , which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a longitude of 26.63 degrees east			0
new moon : this locations on the moon that @entity7 considers ' lunar heritage sites ' and the path @entity36 will take to avoid hitting any of them impact : these 3d renderings show the lunar mountain targeted by the grail mission for controlled impact of the @entity8 spacecraft more than 100 missions have been flung to @entity132 's nearest neighbor since the dawn of the @entity157 including @entity7 's six apollo moon landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface			1
the demise of @entity8 comes on the same month as the 40th launch anniversary of @entity212 , the last manned mission to the moon			0
@entity8 focused exclusively on measuring the moon 's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history			0
after flying in formation for months , they produced the most detailed gravity maps of anybody in the solar system			0
secrets long held by the moon are spilling out			0
@entity8 discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined			0
and it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system - more than previously realized			0
@entity231 so far also appeared to quash the theory that @entity132 once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today			1
besides a scientific return , the mission allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other lunar features as part of collaboration with a science education company founded by @entity23 , who died in july of pancreatic cancer at age 61			1
bout 3,600 classrooms around the world participated , sending back 114,000 photos			0
scientists expect to sift through data and images from the $ 487 million mission for years .			2

impact was not be *visible* from @entity132 , scientists said , as small probes had no fuel to cause *explosion* on impact
action follows end to a successful year - long mission
landing site named in honor of @entity23 , the first @entity24 woman in space , who died earlier this year
