i had to laugh this week when people started writing @entity2 off			1
@entity3 have a few bad results and all of a sudden it ’s his fault ? do n’t be ridiculous			1
@entity2 has bailed his team out so many times and if there is a better player who can do that job for @entity3 then i ’ve yet to see him			1
yes , he will need to be rested at times but there ’s a big difference between being rested and being dropped			2
@entity3 have lost @entity15 and @entity16 has been injured , so there are reasons why they are struggling			1
but it ’s so easy to jump on the bandwagon and say people are finished			2
@entity34 's wild challenge on @entity35 was cynical and unnecessary			1
but the truth is he could even have hurt himself			2
@entity37 did something similar while playing for @entity39 against @entity40 in the 1991 fa cup final			1
he went lunging in on @entity42 and ended up rupturing his own cruciate ligament in his knee			2
i have done plenty of stupid things on a football field but it was rash , particularly after such a good first half			2
now @entity34 misses three matches including a big clash against @entity53			1
with competition so fierce , he will hate being out of the team			0
that edge has always been a big part of @entity34 ’s game			1
it ’s part of what makes him a winner and you do n’t want to take that away but he needs to show greater responsibility , especially as captain			0
@entity34 has been quoted as saying @entity69 can still win the title			1
i ’m not convinced they can but what else is the captain of @entity69 going to say ? it would be more surprising if he had already given up after six games			0
@entity34 was reckless when he kicked out at @entity35 and was sent off on saturday @entity37 injured himself fouling @entity42 in the 1991 @entity79 final @entity80 scored two superb goals against @entity82 , including a fantastic strike from distance that our graphic shows			1
with @entity88 gone , @entity87 need all their strikers firing and @entity80 is invaluable			1
the @entity90 is now something of an away - day specialist			0
he does n’t score too many against the top teams , but he ’s so good in those scrappy games when you need to break down the opposition , as the chart below shows			0
after the start @entity101 have made , there are plenty of players in that side worthy of praise			1
but one who is starting to stand out is @entity107			1
he cost the best part of £ 12million , so you would expect some big performances from him but there is always a question over foreign signings — can they handle life in the @entity116 ? from what i ’ve seen so far , he looks perfect for it			0
@entity107 loves cutting in from that left flank , is quick as lightning and is never short of end product			2
i like what i ’m seeing and if he carries on , he has the potential to rip this league apart			0
at 23 years old , people might wonder why it ’s taken so long for @entity128 to get his chance			0
the truth is @entity39 have always had high hopes , but injuries have prevented him from playing regularly			1
league debuts do n’t come much tougher than starting away against your fiercest rivals but he acquitted himself well			0
he ’s quick and can turn defence into attack in an instant — something that ’s at a premium these days with counter-attacking so important			0
i was speaking to @entity146 in the @entity148 studio and we agreed he ’s got all the attributes to be a top defender , but concentration can let him down			0
saturday was the best i ’ve seen him play in a long time			0
@entity80 celebrates scoring his second goal for @entity87 against @entity82 on saturday @entity155 , being fouled by @entity156 against @entity157 , has made an electric start to life at @entity101 @entity160 congratulates @entity161 after @entity163 's win against @entity164 @entity160 might not have been the most popular appointment at @entity163			1
i doubt if anyone is complaining now			0
they have had some excellent results and i like what he ’s done with @entity161			0
after @entity161 ’s angry tweets aimed at @entity160 last season , it would have been easy to not involve him			2
but @entity161 is a match - winner and @entity160 nipped any issues they had in the bud			0
you do n’t stay in the game as long as @entity160 has without being able to handle difficult situations			0
he ’s not everyone ’s cup of tea , but he has made a good start and has @entity163 playing the same attacking football that served them so well last season .			2

@entity2 is *n't* to blame for @entity3 's poor start this season
@entity34 could have hurt himself by kicking @entity35
@entity80 was superb during @entity87 's win at @entity82
@entity107 is worthy of high praise at @entity101
@entity39 's @entity144 also deserves credit
