by @entity0 in a cloud of smoke and with a deafening roar , a @entity2 spacecraft powers into the night sky on a fast - track mission to reach the @entity8			1
carrying a three - man crew , the @entity10 craft had a flawless launch from the @entity13 in @entity14 - before docking successfully just six hours later			1
with @entity17 's @entity16 , @entity2 cosmonaut @entity18 and @entity20 @entity19 of the @entity21 all on board the spacecraft blasted off last night			1
the @entity10 slipped into a berthing port on the station 's @entity44 module at 1.44am today prompting congratulations from the @entity47 in @entity48 for a successful voyage			0
the trio are joining two @entity2 and an @entity51 who have been at the station , a project of 15 nations , since march			1
in to orbit : spectators watch as the @entity10 rocket disappears in to the sky on its way to a successful docking			0
the crew were congratulated by @entity47 in @entity48 on arrival the three - strong crew prepare for take off ahead of their successful mission to the @entity8 @entity20 astronaut @entity19 waves from the bus after putting on his space suit before boarding the @entity10 rocket just a few hours before their launch until last year , @entity2 spacecraft used to travel two days to reach the station , and this will be only the fifth time that a crew has taken the six - hour ' fast - track ' route			1
after the previous launch , in march , the crew ended up taking the longer route because of a software glitch			2
experts say the faster route is necessary as the cramped interior of the @entity10 can be stressful and uncomfortable for astronauts , many of whom will be suffering from space sickness at the time			0
however , carrying out the mission in one - day requires extremely precise ' orbital adjustments ' from the @entity90 ahead of docking and the shortened trip has only been made possible after extensive studies carried out last year			0
the @entity2 and @entity51 space agencies have continued to co-operate despite friction between the two countries over @entity97			1
an image taken using a fish - eye lens and with a long time exposure , shows the @entity103 rocket 's path as it blasts off at the @entity13 cosmodrome an image taken from @entity106 shows the @entity10 spacecraft approaching the @entity8 's docking port @entity17 depends on the @entity2 spacecraft to ferry crews to the space station and pays @entity2 nearly $ 71million ( Â£ 42 million ) per seat			1
at a prelaunch press conference on tuesday , the new space station crew was asked if the escalating tensions were having any impact on their mission			2
in response , @entity31 , @entity16 and @entity19 slapped their arms around each other and hugged			2
aboard the space station , currently staffed by @entity17 astronaut @entity121 and two @entity2 cosmonauts , it was business as usual , @entity121 said during an inflight interview broadcast on @entity106 on tuesday			2
' we do n't talk about it much , honestly , ' @entity121 said			0
' it does not affect our working relationship			0
we get along very well			0
there are no issues at all up here			0
