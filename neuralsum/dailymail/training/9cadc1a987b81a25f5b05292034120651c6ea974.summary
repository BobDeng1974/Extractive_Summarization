a fault on the new @entity2 superjumbo which caused the grounding of every one of the jets has been blamed on @entity6 engineering			1
@entity8 has now traced the cause of small cracks developing on the wings of some of the £ 250million double - decker @entity13 to a small component engineered in its design centre in @entity16 , @entity17 , it is understood			1
the manufacturer has been forced to order a global reacall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the wing ’s skin to the structure			2
it will affect the entire fleet of 69 planes currently flying			0
discovery : @entity28 discovered the wing cracks in the @entity2 after the compnay ordered a complete aircraft inspection following an engine blowout the @entity2 is a superjumbo that took its first flight on april 2005			0
there are a total of 115 @entity13 in operation as of november 2013			1
it is a double decker jet with a wingspan of 79.75 metres the news is a major blow to @entity6 industry			1
the wings are the only part of the cutting - edge @entity45 which are built in the @entity6			1
@entity8 employs 9,500 people in its @entity16 design centre and manufacting complex in @entity49 , @entity50			1
the wings are then taken by sea to be assembled in @entity53 from parts built across @entity55			1
it is feared the issue could cost @entity8 more than £ 80million in compensation			1
a senior industry expert told @entity60 : ‘ the issue is around the type of aluminum being used and the fitting which , as a result of the assembly , creates the crack ’ , with a source close to the problem adding , ‘ it is a design and process engineering failure ’			0
the minor cracks - no more than two centimetres long - were discovered after @entity28 ordered a fleet - wide inspection following the explosion of a @entity76 engine during a flight , last year			1
@entity8 has insisted there is no threat to safety posed by the flaw and safety agencies on both sides of the @entity84 have given the planes the all clear to continue flights			1
but @entity8 is bringing in the aircraft for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem			1
scrutiny : @entity8 ' new @entity2 superjumbo has come under fire again , after @entity96 had to shut down an engine and return a flight to @entity99 yesterday first class travel : inside the @entity2 's first class cabins			1
it is the latest safety incident to hit the world 's biggest passenger plane , which cost a staggering £ 250million each stretching out : there are just fourteen berths in the first class section of each @entity2			0
the plane can seat up to 853 passengers * if all seats are in economy class configuration an @entity8 spokesman told @entity113 : ' we are not commenting on individual sites and areas			2
' everyone in the company is absolutely focussed on resolving the issue			0
' we are all one @entity8 and the issue involves many parts of our global organisation			2
' the issue is related to the material being used combined with the way parts are assembled on that specific area of the aircraft			0
' the @entity2 made by @entity8 , a unit of @entity129 , was hailed as the next generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry			2
it was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before			0
industry experts say it is not unusual for new planes to develop unforeseen faults in the first few years of flight			0
these are normally quickly identified and ironed out			0
the @entity2 aircraft are in use by @entity28 , @entity96 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
the planes have been in service for five years			0
in total , 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide			0
@entity151 is due to take delivery of 12 @entity13 next year , while the first of @entity155 ’s eight superjumbos will arrive in 2015			2
@entity96 , one of the carriers that operates @entity13 in and out of @entity158 , was the first airline to take delivery of a superjumbo , with the debut passenger flight taking place in october 2007			2
superjumbo services to @entity158 began in march 2008 , with @entity165 airport services starting in september 2010 .			0

all 69 @entity13 in service require overhaul to wings to fix faulty part
@entity8 insists no threat to safety posed by cracks in @entity6 - built and designed wings
