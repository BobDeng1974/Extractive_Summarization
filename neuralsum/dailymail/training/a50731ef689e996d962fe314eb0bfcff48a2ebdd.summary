by @entity0 published : 16:11 est , 13 october 2012 updated : 16:11 est , 13 october 2012 more than 400 serving and retired troops will this week descend on @entity2 to confront @entity3 in a protest unprecedented in the history of the @entity6			1
officers and soldiers from the @entity9 will mount the @entity6 ’s first picket of the @entity11 on thursday after the government axed its second battalion			1
despite being threatened with court martial , serving soldiers are due to join their retired colleagues on the march , which coincides with a parliamentary debate about defence cuts			1
threatened : the @entity9 in @entity20			1
more than 400 serving and retired troops will protest against cuts the @entity6 forbids their participation in any anti-government demonstration			1
it is the first time soldiers have demonstrated on the streets of @entity27 since the @entity28 of 1649 , when 300 members of the @entity30 launched a protest against @entity33 ’s order that they be sent to @entity34			1
it is also the first time the @entity6 has taken to the streets in protest since it was formed in 1707			1
the fusiliers claim mr @entity3 forced through the disbandment of @entity41 to save the @entity42 because he feared cutting soldiers north of the border would boost nationalists in an independence referendum due in 2014			2
rebellion : troops last protested in 1649 against @entity33 ( pictured ) captain @entity49 , a former regimental sergeant major of the @entity39 , said : ‘ there is a lot of anger because we know the government did a deal to save the jocks and to cut @entity57			2
‘ i am sure that serving soldiers will join us on the protest , but given the risks to their careers , the arrangements for their participation are under the radar			1
‘ the @entity65 is threatening to use @entity66 of the 1955 @entity67			0
pressure is being applied , with courts martial promised for those who defy orders			2
so some arrangements must remain cloak - and - dagger			0
’ during thursday ’s protest , the @entity39 , led by retired colonel @entity74 , will march through @entity76 wearing their black berets , and red and white hackles			2
as they pass the @entity79 , they will salute fallen comrades before proceeding to @entity81 where petitions against @entity41 ’s disbandment will be handed in			0
afterwards , they will watch a debate on the cuts from the commons public gallery			0
a motion opposing the scrapping of @entity41 – so far signed by 30 mps – has been brought by @entity91 @entity90 , an @entity92 officer			0
colonel @entity74 said : ‘ the @entity6 marching on @entity2 is unique			0
the @entity65 is making enquiries and it may well have people out monitoring the march			2
‘ there is a lot of sensitivity about this because @entity41 ’s disbandment was referred to the prime minister ’s office , and he gave it the final nod			0
for these reasons there is great risk to soldiers if they attend			0
during the protest , the @entity39 will pass the @entity79 ( pictured ) where they will salute fallen comrades ‘ for the sake of their careers , my advice is they should n’t appear on the march , but if they happen to be passing @entity2 or going through @entity76 at the time that is up to them			1
’ an @entity6 spokesman said : ‘ the armed forces are entitled to their beliefs provided their practice does not conflict with the services ’ values and standards			0
‘ although personnel are not precluded from activity which is potentially political in nature , they are not permitted to do so in uniform			0
