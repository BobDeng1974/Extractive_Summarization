last weekend one of the nation 's largest and most popular music festivals was held , with more than 81,000 people in attendance over the two days			1
of those thousands attending @entity6 at the @entity7 , 830 were stopped by police , taken into a booth , stripped down and searched for drugs by officers			1
@entity12 , 27 , was one of those people			2
except he had no drugs on him , is not a drug taker , and had not come into contact with any illegal substances			0
this comes as new research revealed that thousands of innocent @entity21 are subjected to humiliating strip searches in similar situations every year , while 64 percent of sniffer dog detections are incorrect			1
@entity12 ( not pictured ) told @entity25 how he was detected by a sniffer dog and strip searched at @entity6 festival on saturday ' a sniffer dog sat down next to me and they took me off into a little booth , ' @entity12 said , referring to the way dog are trained to sit when they detect the scent of drugs on a person			1
' i had to take off my pants , shirt , shoes , everything , ' @entity12 - who did not wish for his surname to be published - told @entity25			2
' it was violating ... it was very confronting			0
' i felt ostracised and like there was something wrong with me , and told i had something on me when i did n't , ' @entity12 said			2
initially the @entity50 man was asked to handed over his identification and wallet - which officers spent a number of minutes ' scrambling ' through			1
then he was taken into a booth which he estimated to measure about 5 metres square and forced to remove all his clothes			0
' they go through everything you have on you , your clothes , move to your shoes and bang them on the desk to make sure nothing falls out			0
' the 27 - year - old ( not pictured ) was not carrying any drugs , and a scent had been incorrectly detected on him by a sniffer dog ' i was just standing there with no clothes on while there 's two big police officers going through everything			1
' ' they were continuously asking me the same questions over and over again , and quite forcibly			0
' ( they asked ) " do you take drugs ? " " do your friends take drugs ? " " were you taking drugs yesterday ? " , ' @entity12 said			2
the 27 - year - old was also forced to , while naked , hold his genitals and bend over so police could be sure was n't concealing anything			0
although at no time during the search did police touch the 27 - year - old , he said the 10 minute long ordeal was very uncomfortable , especially as he is not a drug user and maintained he had never come into contact with anything of the sort			0
' i was quite calm because i did n't have anything on me , ( but ) it was violating , quite an uncomfortable experience , ' said @entity12			0
while he acknowledged the police were doing their job , his issue was with the ' confronting and intimidating ' way officers carried out the search and ' assumed i was guilty ' , which he was not			0
over 830 of the 81,000 people who attended the festival were searched for illicit substances the @entity50 man also condemned the use of sniffer dogs saying he thinks they 're both unnecessary and inaccurate , and do more harm than good			1
' i 'm not a fan of it ... i had a pretty low opinion of it in the first place ... 75 percent of the time or more they pick up people who do n't have anything on them , ' @entity12 claimed			2
' it 's never going to stop people from taking drugs , it might just force them to take them before the festivals			0
' this comes as @entity126 revealed invasive strip and cavity searches by police have increased by nearly a third over the past five years			0
data obtained by the media group also showed than at least 10,000 people per year are wrongly subjected to these humiliating searches , where they 're forced to strip down a bend over to prove they have nothing to hide			1
further to this , sniffer dogs incorrectly identify people to be carrying drugs when they 're 64 percent of the time			1
' it 's kind of funny they 've got one dog to pick up a scent from an area full of thousands of people , ' @entity12 said			1
over all 220 people were charged with drug offences over the two day @entity6 festival , and police said they were ' disappointed ' with the high number of arrests			1
a 21 - year - old was found collapsed and was rushed to hospital not breathing , while another 12 also attended emergency rooms for mostly drug - related illnesses .			0
