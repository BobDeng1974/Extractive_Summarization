the @entity1 's decision to broadcast live matches on friday nights has been criticised by the @entity4 for clashing with a slot which has traditionally been used for lower - league games			1
the friday night games - up to 10 matches a season - are part of the @entity1 's new invitation to tender ( @entity11 ) for the domestic tv rights for the 2016 - 2019 seasons			1
@entity4 chief executive @entity14 - who also announced that no clubs other than @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 will have @entity19 transfer embargoes for january - said he understood the pressures on the @entity1 but labelled the move ' disappointing ' and ' frustrating '			1
@entity24 's @entity23 skips by @entity26 's @entity25 in their friday @entity28 match on @entity29 @entity4 ceo @entity14 says friday night @entity1 games will hurt the lower tiers @entity32 and @entity33 in their roles as pundits for @entity37 @entity14 said : ' the @entity1 's tender document includes an increased number of live matches and an intention to broadcast up to 10 matches on a friday evening , which is obviously disappointing as this slot has traditionally been used by the @entity4 for its own televised matches			1

' @entity14 blamed the demands of the @entity52 and @entity53 for adding to the pressure on domestic competitions			0
@entity29 ' @entity56 and @entity57 feature as part of their coverage of 116 games this season @entity29 currently have the rights to broadcast a @entity1 match on monday nights he added : ' they [ the pressures ] are being created mainly by the expansion of @entity69 club competitions because leagues are prohibited from broadcasting their matches on the same night			0
in addition , it means that @entity1 clubs in @entity69 competitions can not play in televised domestic matches on a monday evening			0
' in any event , the broadcasting of @entity1 matches on a friday night at the level being proposed will always be more preferable than the idea of the entire @entity1 fixture schedule being shown live , or matches being shown at 3pm on a saturday , as this could have catastrophic consequences for our clubs			2
