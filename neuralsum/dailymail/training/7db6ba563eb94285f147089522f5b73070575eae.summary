the future of robots is here - and it hints at a world in which nothing can stand in the way of the mechanical bots			0
called @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , the robot adapts to different terrains and changes shape automatically , so it can instantly switch from walking to flying			1
it was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat , @entity13 , and could one day be used by search - and - rescue teams			1
it features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric that can be used both as wings and as legs @entity9 features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric that can be used both as wings and as legs , also known as ' whegs '			1
‘ the issue of how to use robot in multiple terrains is an ongoing question in robotics research , ’ said doctoral assistant @entity9 at the @entity27 at the @entity28			1
the @entity35 military is hoping to develop hawk - like drones that can not only scan dangerous locations from the air , but also fly through buildings			2
it hopes its new generation of drones will be able to fly up to 45 miles per hour ( 20 metres per second ) while navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces			2
and , the military wants the drones to be able to do this without any communication from outside operators , and without relying on @entity46			0
the drones are being developed as part of its @entity50 ( @entity49 ) program , which is currently writing the algorithms to improve their navigation			0
according to @entity53 , these drones could help military teams patrol dangerous environments , as well as help rescue teams respond to disasters such as earthquakes			0
‘ this project aims to design robots for exploration , search - and - rescue , or surveillance applications			2
‘ within these contexts , the robots have to deal with very complex terrains , such as semi-collapsed buildings , deep caverns , or forests with a lot of vegetation			1
’ he added that the majority of current robots use only one so - called ‘ locomotion strategy ’ , such as rolling , walking , flying , hovering , climbing , swimming , crawling , or jumping			1
by using just one range of movements , mr @entity9 said existing robots ' flexibility and adaptability to different environments is limited			1
for example , in a search - and - rescue mission winged robots can quickly fly over extended areas , but , exploring confined environments then becomes challenging			0
‘ for these reasons , robots capable of both ground and flying - hovering locomotion are well suited to navigate complex environments , ’ added mr @entity9			1
he calls this approach ‘ adaptive morphology ’ , in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement			1
this approach also means the robot can self - adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use			2
@entity9 was inspired by the movement of the vampire bat ( pictured )			1
the designers hope their adaptive robotic ‘ bat ’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area , before walking through the rubble to search for victims mr @entity9 hopes his adaptive ‘ bat ’ could be used to find victims in dangerous areas after a natural disaster by being remotely deployed to fly to an affected area , for example			1
it would then be able to walk through a disaster zone to locate victims , meaning human rescue teams can concentrate their efforts in other areas			1
future development of the @entity9 will include the possibility to hover and to take off autonomously from the ground so the robot can return after a mission			1
the researchers are also hoping to make adaptive deployable wings that will improve the mobility of existing flying robots			2
wing shapes could be modified to increase the efficiency of forward flight , hover flight , and landing			0
scary ? the strange snake - legged robot could one day help save lives in disaster zones it walks , crawls , kicks ... and looks like the stuff of sci - fi nightmares			2
but the terrifyingly named ' @entity147 ' may in fact be bringing robotic rescue workers closer to reality			0
scientists hope that research into the six - legged machine will enable robots to become more responsive to their surroundings and move more intuitively , much like living animals			0
the walking robot owes its name to the snake - like limbs it uses to skillfully manoeuvre its surroundings			0
in the long - term , scientists hope these machines could be used for urban search and rescue , archaeological exploration and , thanks to the robots ' ability to move through pipes , inspection of power plants , refineries and sewers			0
@entity176 's @entity175 developed the mechanics over six months and it is just one example of a robot that could one day be built using a modular system			0
researchers are already working on other modules such as force - sensing feet , wheels and tank - like treads that will make it easier to create totally different machines adapted for different environments			0
' by creating a system that can be readily reconfigured and that also is easy to program , we believe we can build robots that are not only robust and flexible , but also inexpensive , ' said professor @entity195 , who led the research			0
experts said current robots that only have one movement are limited			0
they call their new approach ‘ adaptive morphology ’ , in which parts of the robot are shared between the different forms of movement ( pictured )			1
this approach also means the robot can self - adjust to adapt to which movement it needs to use			2

the robot is called @entity8 ( @entity9 )
it adapts to different terrains , and was inspired by the vampire bat
@entity9 features a foldable skeleton mechanism covered in fabric
this mechanism can be used as both wings and legs , known as ‘ whegs ’
approach has been *dubbed* by @entity225 experts as ' adaptive morphology '
they hope @entity9 could be used to fly to the scene of a natural disaster and walk through the rubble to find victims , for example
