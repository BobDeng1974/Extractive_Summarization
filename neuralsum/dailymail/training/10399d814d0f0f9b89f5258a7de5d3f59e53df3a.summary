the @entity1 group stage reached the half - way point this week with a series of entertaining and goal - laden matches			1
we cast our eye over the eight groups to see who 's cruising through and who still has work to do in order to reach the knockout stage			2
@entity14 @entity17 champions @entity15 have work to do if they are to avoid a repeat of last season 's group stage exit			1
their 1 - 0 defeat by @entity23 on wednesday night leaves them third in the group and heaps pressure on @entity28 's side to get a result in the return match in @entity31 the week after next			1
the @entity32 have looked strong at home and that has been enough to offset a 2 - 0 loss in @entity36 and put them top of the group at the midway stage			1
@entity41 champions and last season 's runners - up @entity42 lost in @entity32 on the opening matchday but back - to - back home victories have put them in a strong position			2
you would still back them and @entity15 to advance , however			2
@entity23 went top of @entity51 after their 1 - 0 win over @entity15 on wednesday september 16 @entity23 3 @entity42 2 @entity15 2 @entity36 0 october 1 @entity36 2 @entity23 0 @entity42 1 @entity15 0 october 22 @entity42 5 @entity36 0 @entity23 1 @entity15 0 november 4 @entity53 vs @entity42 @entity15 vs @entity23 november 26 @entity42 vs @entity23 @entity53 vs @entity15 december 9 @entity23 vs @entity36 @entity15 vs @entity42 @entity54 @entity56 's masterful performance on @entity57 has put them on the brink of qualification for the knockout stages with three wins from three			1
the defending champions beat @entity63 5 - 1 at the @entity64 on matchday one and then recovered from an early scare to beat @entity67 2 - 1 in @entity68			2
a win against @entity70 in the return match on november 4 will seal their progress			0
the @entity68 debutants are actually second on goal difference following their 1 - 0 success over @entity63 this week , while @entity70 in third place and @entity63 in fourth also have three points			2
@entity70 's match with @entity63 at @entity79 on matchday six still looks like being the decisive tie			0
@entity81 and @entity56 have a 100 per cent record in @entity54 and are favourites to advance september 16 @entity70 2 @entity67 1 @entity56 5 @entity63 1 october 1 @entity63 1 @entity70 0 @entity67 1 @entity56 2 october 22 @entity67 1 @entity63 0 @entity70 0 @entity56 3 november 4 @entity63 vs @entity67 @entity56 vs @entity70 november 26 @entity67 vs @entity70 @entity63 vs @entity56 december 9 @entity70 vs @entity63 @entity56 vs @entity67 @entity84 all to play for in @entity84 as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 battle for the two qualification slots			1
the @entity91 side seized top spot with their 2 - 0 win over @entity87 on matchday three , while @entity86 are second despite two drab goalless draws			2
in an open group , it looks as though @entity97 are the fall guys , but that could change if they beat @entity86 in the next round of fixtures			2
@entity85 's players celebrate their opening goal against @entity87 on wednesday september 16 @entity86 1 @entity85 0 @entity97 0 @entity87 2 october 1 @entity87 0 @entity86 0 @entity85 3 @entity97 1 october 22 @entity85 2 @entity87 0 @entity86 0 @entity97 0 november 4 @entity87 vs @entity85 @entity97 vs @entity86 november 26 @entity87 vs @entity97 @entity85 vs @entity86 december 9 @entity86 vs @entity87 @entity97 vs @entity85 @entity103 @entity104 have raced away in this group , with @entity106 the favourites to join them following wednesday night 's dramatic late turnaround against @entity109			1
the @entity91 team have defied their poor league form to win all three matches so far , racking up nine goals without conceding			0
they will ensure their place in the last 16 if they complete the double over @entity118 on matchday four			0
@entity120 's late winner in @entity121 has completely changed @entity106 's outlook and a win over @entity109 at the @entity124 in two weeks will put them in a very strong position			0
as a result of wednesday 's results , @entity109 and @entity118 are left scrapping for the @entity129 consolation prize			0
@entity120 's ( left ) late winner against @entity109 has really helped their chances of getting through september 16 @entity118 1 @entity109 1 @entity104 2 @entity106 0 october 1 @entity106 4 @entity118 1 @entity109 0 @entity104 3 october 22 @entity109 1 @entity106 2 @entity118 0 @entity104 4 november 4 @entity106 vs @entity109 @entity104 vs @entity118 november 26 @entity109 vs @entity118 @entity106 vs @entity104 december 9 @entity118 vs @entity106 @entity104 vs @entity109 @entity132 @entity133 are cruising to top spot in @entity132 with their incredible 7 - 1 win in @entity136 opening up a five - point cushion at the top			1
three points in the return match with @entity141 at the @entity142 in two weeks will ensure their progress and it is then a shoot - out between the @entity17 and @entity146 as to who will follow them			1
@entity146 , who surrendered a two - goal lead against @entity151 on tuesday , ideally need maximum points from their next two home games to advance			1
it is likely they will need to go to the @entity156 and get something on matchday six			0
@entity133 's players salute their travelling fans after tuesday night 's 7 - 1 demolition of @entity141 september 17 @entity141 5 @entity151 1 @entity133 1 @entity146 0 september 30 @entity151 0 @entity133 1 @entity146 1 @entity141 1 october 21 @entity151 2 @entity146 2 @entity141 1 @entity133 7 november 5 @entity146 vs @entity151 @entity133 vs @entity141 november 25 @entity151 vs @entity141 @entity146 vs @entity133 december 10 @entity141 vs @entity146 @entity133 vs @entity151 @entity161 @entity162 and @entity163 look favourites to advance from this group , as was expected			1
the @entity167 champions stayed in top spot after their 1 - 0 win over @entity170 in @entity171 this week and @entity172 beat @entity173 3 - 1 to damage the @entity175 challenge			1
if @entity177 and co can avoid defeat in the @entity180 on matchday four , they will be pretty much there			0
@entity170 and @entity173 have yet to win in the group stage and will contest the @entity129 spot			1
@entity183 celebrates scoring @entity162 's winner against @entity170 in @entity171 on tuesday september 17 @entity163 1 @entity170 0 @entity173 1 @entity162 1 september 30 @entity162 3 @entity163 2 @entity170 1 @entity173 1 october 21 @entity170 0 @entity162 1 @entity163 3 @entity173 1 november 5 @entity162 vs @entity170 @entity173 vs @entity163 november 25 @entity170 vs @entity163 @entity162 vs @entity173 december 10 @entity163 vs @entity162 @entity173 vs @entity170 @entity185 @entity186 are in a strong position to advance as winners of @entity185 and a win in @entity190 against @entity191 will pretty much ensure top spot			0
@entity193 , who edged out @entity194 in a dramatic 4 - 3 win on tuesday , are favourities to follow them and remain unbeaten			1
@entity191 still have an outside chance while @entity194 look down and out			0
@entity186 celebrate one of their six goals in the rout of @entity191 at @entity201 video we are playing with confidence - @entity203 september 17 @entity186 1 @entity193 1 @entity191 1 @entity194 1 september 30 @entity194 0 @entity186 1 @entity193 1 @entity191 1 october 21 @entity193 4 @entity194 3 @entity186 6 @entity191 0 november 5 @entity194 vs @entity193 @entity191 vs @entity186 november 25 @entity193 vs @entity186 @entity194 vs @entity191 december 10 @entity186 vs @entity194 @entity191 vs @entity193 @entity204 plenty still to play for in @entity204 with @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 all in with a shout			0
@entity207 's 7 - 0 rout of @entity208 on tuesday has put them second behind the @entity212 side and both looks well - placed to make it through			0
@entity216 's return to @entity218 's top competition has been a let - down , with a draw and two defeats so far			0
