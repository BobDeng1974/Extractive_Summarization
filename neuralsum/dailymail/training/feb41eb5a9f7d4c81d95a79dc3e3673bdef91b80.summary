if @entity1 had sat down with that clipboard of his and sketched out the perfect scenario for his new - look @entity4 , he could not have planned it any better than sunday ’s win over @entity7			1
a spectacular @entity9 introduction for record £ 60million signing @entity11 , @entity13 ’s first goal in a @entity4 shirt and hugely impressive debuts from @entity16 and @entity17 meant that @entity18 had the luxury of sending on @entity20 with his team 4 - 0 up and in cruise control			1
the surge of optimism around @entity9 was palpable			0
after the slide into mediocrity under @entity27 and a worryingly slow start to @entity18 ’s reign , here was evidence of a complete transformation			0
@entity11 celebrates scoring his first goal for @entity4 on his home debut against @entity7 @entity35 ( left ) holds his hands aloft in frustration against @entity7 after failing to find the net once more @entity39 unleashes an unstoppable shot past @entity41 in the @entity7 goal to score @entity4 's fourth @entity13 is understandably delighted after scoring his first @entity4 goal to put them 1 - 0 up @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) were impressive during their @entity4 debuts against @entity7 if there is one problem for the @entity48 , and it has become a recurring theme in recent weeks , it is how he accommodates his gaal - acticos			1
the man who appeared to be most under threat in the new order was @entity39			2
many people saw the £ 37m signing of the @entity56 in january as a panic buy			0
certainly the way he was shunted around the pitch under @entity27 suggested that little forethought had gone into the move			0
@entity63 dropped @entity39 for his first game in temporary charge at the end of last season and @entity18 was certainly under no obligation to find room for the former @entity71 man when he took over			2
with the new manager looking to inject more pace into the team , it was suggested that @entity39 might actually slow @entity4 down			2
four games into the new season , and it would appear that he has an integral role to play at @entity81			2
@entity39 ’s goal against @entity7 on sunday was his eighth in the last 10 @entity85 games , quite some record for a player who is essentially out there to provide assists			1
the way he linked up with @entity91 at the top of the midfield diamond was central to @entity4 ’s game plan , and may continue to be so even when @entity96 and @entity97 return from injury to give the manager an even bigger selection quandary			0
@entity39 runs off with his first pumped in celebration after netting @entity4 's fourth and final goal against @entity7 @entity39 's form - he has scored eight goals in 10 @entity85 games - puts @entity107 's place under threat @entity39 - eight goals in last 10 @entity85 matches @entity111 goals in last 10 @entity85 matches so who will be the odd man out among @entity4 ’s big names ? on current form , the player most under threat would appear to be @entity35			1
amid the wave of euphoria on sunday , it was overlooked that the @entity48 did not actually play very well			0
in fact , he has not played particularly well for @entity4 for some time			0
the man credited with tipping the title balance in @entity4 ’s favour after he arrived from @entity124 two years ago , faded under @entity27 last season			2
the highlight , a @entity128 hat - trick against @entity129 , was followed by news that he would miss six weeks with a knee injury			0
it was not enough to prevent @entity107 from playing for @entity18 at the @entity133 and scoring that spectacular diving header against @entity135 in the opening game , but earlier this month he was forced to deny rumours that he will need surgery to cure his knee after @entity4 moved to sign @entity20			1
you can like our @entity4 facebook page here @entity1 has a big decision to make as to whether he should keep @entity107 in his starting xi @entity20 ( right ) came off the bench to make his debut against @entity7 and could replace @entity107 ( left ) @entity148 fires home emphatically to put @entity4 3 - 0 up against @entity7 before half - time certainly his form in the early part of the new season has failed to dispel concerns that he is still struggling with the problem			1
on sunday , @entity107 posed very little threat apart from one moment in the second half when he was played in by a quite wonderful flick from @entity91			2
he chose to hit it first time rather than take the ball down and beat @entity162 , and normally you would have backed him to bury it			0
instead he snatched at it and fired straight at the @entity7 keeper			0
it was only one moment , but it seemed to sum up @entity107 at present			0
when @entity18 was confirmed as @entity4 ’s new manager in may , it was assumed that his fellow @entity48 would be an automatic choice for a first - team place - if not the captaincy as well			1
that honour went to @entity148 , of course , and now @entity107 finds himself in serious danger of being squeezed out of the line - up altogether			1
when @entity20 is fully fit and ready to start , something will have to give			0
@entity148 could drop into midfield in place of @entity39 , or @entity18 could switch his formation again			1
that is unlikely , however , and @entity107 has every reason to be worried former @entity4 defender @entity182 ( right ) competes with @entity107 during the match with @entity7 @entity107 ( right ) struggled during the 4 - 0 victory over @entity7 and was outshone by his @entity4 team - mates			1

@entity1 's new - look @entity4 side thrashed @entity7 4 - 0
new signings @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity16 and @entity17 were all impressive and @entity20 appeared off the bench for @entity4
@entity39 starred once again and looked *brilliant* in no 10 role for @entity4
@entity39 has netted eight goals in his last 10 @entity85 *appearances*
@entity35 's place under threat from @entity39 , @entity20 and @entity148
@entity48 has struggled with form and injuries for @entity4 this season
*persistent* niggling knee injuries have affected @entity107
