one college student 's wedding dreams came true when a generous stranger and fellow bride - to - be anonymously paid for the costly gown she had fallen in love with - but could n't afford			1
@entity6 , a 21 - year - old full - time student at @entity7 , was shopping at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , when she found a $ 480 wedding dress which was perfect in every way – apart from the price tag			1
however , as fate would have it , an anonymous bride - to - be chose that very day to give the shop 's owner , @entity17 , enough money to pay for any dress in the room with the promise that the donation would go to a woman who needed help buying her dream gown			1
young love : @entity6 , a 21 - year - old student at @entity7 , is engaged to marry @entity28 , 21 good deed : while shopping for her wedding dress , a generous stranger anonymously paid for the dream gown that @entity33 could not afford			1
the dress ( pictured ) is now hanging in the student ’s apartment in @entity10 ' when i was told in the store that someone had paid for my wedding dress , i was overcome with emotion , ' @entity33 told @entity42 in an email			1
' never had i received such a direct answer to prayer			0
' like most typical college students , @entity33 , who is seventh out of eight children , was financially strapped , but determined to finance as much of her wedding as she could on her own			2
although the shop she was visiting specialized in modest , affordable gowns that range from $ 300 to $ 550 , she also had her college tuition fees to think of			0
the one : this bride can be seen wearing the wedding gown that @entity33 had fallen in love with classic white : the dress ( pictured ) retails for $ 480 at @entity8 , a store that specializes in modern , affordable bridal gowns popped the question : mr @entity28 proposed to @entity33 on a winter 's day with the help of some family members miss @entity6 revealed that before she went to her appointment to try on dresses she said a small prayer asking @entity65 to help her find a way to pay for her bridal gown if she found one			1
' i knew that my tuition costs needed to be paid soon , but i also knew that if i found the right dress that morning , i would need to pay for it , ' she explained			2
' the mystery fellow bride who so graciously served me on friday was not in my room when i prayed that morning ... , ' she said			1
' i do n't know what inspired her			0
i do n't know if it was planned , or spur - of - the - moment			0
but i do know that she was a direct instrument in @entity65 's hands			0
' special moment : the bride - to - be and her new fiance can be seen showing of her engagement ring save the date : mr @entity28 and @entity33 cuddled up and smiled for the camera following his proposal last month miss @entity6 received her ' miraculous wedding dress ' from her ' anonymous angel ' , only a month after her fiance @entity28 , 21 , got down on one knee and proposed			1
she said she chose to share her incredible story in order to express her ' extreme gratitude and to inspire others '			0
the act of kindness that was bestowed upon her has also motivated @entity33 to have a ' @entity97 ' theme for the may 1 nuptials			1
i do : after getting engaged a month ago , the couple is set to get married on may 1 summer loving : the @entity7 students posed for a photo during a trip to the beach ' you do n't necessarily have to go buy a person 's wedding dress to help someone , ' she said			2
' it is in the little things that hearts will be touched and softened			0
this experience has changed my lifelong perspective			0
' miss @entity6 noted that is so easy be self - absorbed with our personal situations and financial struggles			2
' this experience caused me to look outside of myself and to want to do good ... , ' she said			0
' i am excited to give to other people who need the help as i did			0
' and although her benefactor has chosen to remain anonymous , @entity33 wants her to know that she has an open invitation to her spring wedding .			2

@entity6 , 21 , was shopping at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 when she found the $ 480 dream dress
a fellow bride - to - be decided to anonymously buy her the gown as an act of kindness
the experience inspired @entity33 to have a ' @entity97 ' theme for her may 1 wedding to @entity28 , 21
