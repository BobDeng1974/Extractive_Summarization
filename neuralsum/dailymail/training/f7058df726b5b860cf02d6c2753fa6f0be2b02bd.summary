by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 19 september 2012 futuristic technology inspired by the @entity2 hit film @entity3 is to be used by one police force to predict where future crimes will take place			1
@entity8 is the first in the @entity10 to use the ‘ predictive policing ’ method to stop house or flat burglaries before they happen in @entity16			1
their new software system maps crimes and calculates where the next burglary will probably happen , allowing them to send officers to that area of the city			1
neighbouring properties are also at an increased risk of being struck within seven days of a house burglary as criminals view the area as a ' weak spot '			1
using this theory the force says it can stop crime before it happens - just like in the thriller @entity3 which saw a team of futuristic cops chasing and punishing offenders before they committed a crime			1
expert : officer @entity58 says this software mixed with every day policing will prevent crimes happening prof @entity62 , who helped design the software , said : ' we run it through our software and this generates predictions and a map showing the exact locations where crimes are most likely to take place in the next few days			2
' they can be used by the police to deploy the resources as efficiently as possible			0
' supt @entity58 , the officer in charge of @entity76 , added : ' i think the majority of our successes will be around hunch , intuition and offender management			0
' but we still need to get out there and try to deter crime taking place in the first place			0
' we think probably this is the best way of doing that , but the whole thing with an experiment is you do n’t know until you analyse it afterwards			0
' the trial of the software , called @entity76 , has been designed to identify and interpret crime patterns in order to prevent further similar offences			2
police patrols will be stepped up in areas of @entity16 which are highlighted by the programme in a bid to catch repeat offenders			2
businesses and properties which have been burgled will also be fitted with additional security alarms and cameras			2
officers say nearly 30 per cent of the 8,000 burglaries in @entity16 in 2011 were repeat offences which were committed in close proximity to earlier break - ins			1
in order to test ‘ predictive policing ’ , half the city will be policed in the traditional way while the other half will use the computer programme			0
plot : @entity2 's pre-crime department in minority report uses a system that allows them to see into the future and see crime happen in advance idea : pre-cogs like this one , played by @entity127 , see into the future but the system turns out to be flawed the force is working alongside the @entity131 at @entity132 in @entity133			1
crime stats will be fed into the computer at @entity136 in @entity16 where the teams can add data and decide where resources are concentrated			1
@entity8 is in the process of cutting 2,000 staff as a result of budget cuts			0
the six - month pilot in the @entity145 is most extensive trial of predictive policing to date and is being part - funded by the @entity148			0
previous trials have taken place in the suburbs of @entity152 in the @entity153 , where early results have been described as ' promising ' .			0

@entity8 will use software that plots crime and predicts probability of it happening again
homes burgled in @entity16 are often targeted again by crooks - as are their neighbouring properties
computer uses this data to map which homes are at risk in the coming week
officers say they can stop crime in areas of @entity16 before it happens
@entity2 's pre-crime department in minority report used a system that could see into the future
