@entity0 to get an idea how much of an emblem @entity4 is to @entity5 , you only had to take a glance through the match programme and look at @entity8			1
before kick - off , a banner was unveiled proclaiming him ' the best there is , the best there was and the best there ever will be ' in homage to the @entity17 - bound talisman			2
more intriguing , though , were the 11 images of him in the programme			0
his commercial worth to @entity5 is huge , as he was the main face on every sponsored page			0
who will possibly fill that void when he is gone ? @entity5 fans unveiled a @entity4 banner before the clash against @entity29 on tuesday night @entity4 is playing his final few months with @entity5 before leaving for @entity17 in the summer jose in game mode watching @entity32 is an experience in itself and from the moment he emerged out of the tunnel , you could tell he was in game mode			1
ditching his usual smart attire , @entity32 wore a tracksuit , overcoat and snood and that casual ensemble sparked memories of the way he was dressed for the game that decided the title race on april 27			0
it was also interesting when @entity29 's supporters began taunting @entity4 for that slip			1
@entity32 was not impressed , looking at the away section and shaking his head			2
@entity32 did n't look impressed when @entity29 fans ridiculed @entity4 for last year 's slip @entity32 kicks the ball up on the touchline during @entity29 's draw at @entity56 @entity29 's waterfront warm - up visitors to @entity5 's waterfront on monday morning would have been taken aback to see something other than the @entity61 and the famous ferry across the @entity63			1
during their traditional pre-match stroll , @entity29 's squad – who were staying in the near - by @entity66 – started doing a warm - up to get them ready for the challenge			0
it might not have been the manicured pitches of @entity74 but , for @entity32 , the cobbles of the @entity71 certainly had the designated effect			0
@entity76 no sign of @entity78 at @entity56 again and he let the world know his whereabouts by posting a picture of himself at home on @entity84			0
@entity78 , whose last start for @entity5 was against @entity29 on november 8 , was , according to @entity86 , ill with a chest infection last week , which is why he missed he trip to @entity89			1
he was photographed out in @entity90 over the weekend and then on monday morning informed @entity86 he was still under the weather			2
it is now , surely , a question of ' when ' rather than ' if ' there is parting of the ways			0
confused locals watched on as the @entity29 players warmed up in the street on monday morning @entity78 posted an @entity84 picture of him in a onesie watching @entity5 in his living room			1

@entity5 and @entity29 drew 1 - 1 in the first *leg* of the @entity105 *semi-final*
@entity4 was *hailed* as the best ever by banner unveiled in the @entity8
@entity32 did n't look impressed when @entity29 fans ridiculed @entity4
@entity29 warmed up for the match on the waterfront on monday morning
