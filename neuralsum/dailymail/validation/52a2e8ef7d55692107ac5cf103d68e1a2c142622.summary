' many households on the coast were left without power after ferocious storms swept in from the @entity72 unsurprisingly , all trains lines were suspended in @entity34 at the height of the storm , with structural engineers working overtime in january and february 2014 hundreds of homes were flooded as the worst storms in 20 years continued to cause misery across the country			1
