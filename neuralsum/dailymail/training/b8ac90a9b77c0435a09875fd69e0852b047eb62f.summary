it was the moment @entity1 the elephant had waited a lifetime for – a family of his own			1
last week the gentle giant , who captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years – joined five female elephants at @entity14 's @entity13 in @entity15			1
his new family , named the @entity18 , have all been rescued from barbaric treatment			1
@entity40 founder @entity39 , who led the rescue operation to save @entity1 , said : ' we are delighted @entity1 has fitted in so well with the first family he 's ever had since he was orphaned by poachers as a calf			1
' he had been so terribly brutalized for 50 years that we feared he 'd be unable to live with his own kind			1
he did n't even know how to be an elephant			2
but now it 's like he 's always been with them			0
' when we first released him , he held back and he was clearly wary			2
three of our female elephants @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 ran up to him – their ears flapping wildly – a sign they were excited and delighted to meet him			1
they also made high - pitched trumpeting sounds – a greeting			2
affectionate : one of @entity1 's female friends , left , strokes his trunk with hers			1
he was initially wary of contact because of his appalling treatment at the hands of captors rehabilitation : the pool 's water lets @entity1 take weight off of his legs - which are painful from years of abuse taking it easy : @entity1 was poached as a calf - and endured an awful life as a tourist attraction - but can now relax ' then each of them touched him with their trunks , clearly reassuring him before they wandered off into the grazing land at our @entity13 and @entity82 at @entity33			1
it was incredibly touching after all he 'd been through			0
' on july 4 this year the charity along with their counterparts in @entity15 saved @entity1 from dying in his bonds in a daring midnight rescue operation			1
a team of ten vets and wildlife experts from the charity were joined by twenty @entity92 officers and six policemen to seize @entity1 in the @entity95 region			1
mr @entity39 said : ' he 'd been poached as a calf from the wild			0
poachers either slaughter the mother , or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into			0
' the mother cries for her baby for days after he 's been stolen – the illegal elephant trade is sickening			0
the calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their owners – their spirits are effectively broken			0
' 27 owners ' : @entity1 , right , was passed from owner to owne in captivity , and eventually was found in spiked chains playtime : @entity1 , left , has been able to start his recovery in the sanctuary , after being blighted by wounds all over his legs and body while in captivity ' @entity1 's case was particularly tragic as we believe he has been sold again and again and might have had 27 owners – he 's been treated as a commodity and beaten into accepting his new handler every two years of his life			1
' by the time we found him he was in a pathetic condition			0
he had n't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper			2
' he had no shelter at night , and was being used as a prop to beg with from dawn until dusk or being used for giving tourists joy rides			0
and most heartrendingly of all – the chains that cut into his legs had been there for 50 years			1
' it took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – an act of unthinkable cruelty			1
' his legs were so covered in abscesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads , that we have spent much more than expected on his medical treatment , and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds			2
' tearful : @entity1 , pictured above moments before he was freed from captivity , can be seen with ' tears ' streaming down his face cruel : according to his rescuers , @entity1 had been in chains for as long as 50 years bound : @entity1 's chains , seen up close above , took 45 minutes for rescuers to disentangle the elephants @entity1 has joined have also suffered horrendously before they were rescued by the charity			1
the second most recent member of the herd is eighteen - year - old female @entity51 , saved from the streets of @entity172 ten months ago			1
although she was young she suffered from severe arthritis , obesity and a heart condition			0
mr @entity39 said : ' she 'd been exploited and used as a begging prop , she was neglected and her owners had got her addicted to fried junk food			0
' when we saved her she was 1,200 kilos overweight and so fat we had to use a crane to get her onto a specially - strengthened truck to drive her to our centre			2
she was so huge her knees were giving way and she had early arthritis			0
' our vets were concerned that she would not live much longer if she was not rescued immediately			2
but she has a great , if mischievous , character – even on the drive home her trunk kept sneaking through the window and she was searching in the drivers pockets for a treat			2
' we have spent the last 10 months rehabilitating her – and at first it was a battle to get her to eat the food she should be eating			2
now she 's finally getting healthier , leaner and enjoying being a free elephant			0
' but although @entity14 was given legal custody of her by the @entity199 , her previous cruel owners are petitioning the courts to get her back and so now we are in a court battle to stop her being returned to the abusive situation we rescued her from			2
' midnight raid : rescuers from @entity14 are seen above breaking @entity1 free from captivity @entity52 , 16 , was rescued on june 29 2012 on the outskirts of @entity207 after she and a second elephant were hit by a speeding truck			1
the second elephant was killed instantly and @entity52 was left with cuts , shards of glass and wounds all over her body as well as a severely injured leg			0
she was undernourished and her owners were arrested for negligence			0
mr @entity39 said : ' her leg was fractured and it 's taken us 18 months to nurse her back to health			0
she 's slowly rebuilding her life			0
' @entity53 was a circus elephant who was rescued after she was made to perform for years with a broken right rear leg			1
mr @entity39 said : ' she still has a terrible limp where the break was never treated – the fracture was severe and when we rescued her she 'd suffered for years in pain as it was never allowed to heal as they never allowed her to rest			1
' road to freedom : @entity1 was taken the sanctuary in @entity33 , northern @entity15 , in this truck finally @entity238 , who is blind in one eye was smuggled illegally for years before the charity was alerted to her plight and immediately stepped in to rescue her			1
mr @entity39 said : ' @entity238 had spent more than 40 years of her life doing hard labour , being abused and being underfed			2
and her maltreatment and severe abuse by her previous owners caused her to be blinded in one eye			0
' her owner would hide her in a windowless , deserted warehouse			0
her owner would smuggle her across state borders in the dead of night to avoid detection by the authorities as he has no valid documentation for her legal possession			0
' she was frail and scrawny and almost skeletal in appearance and covered in sores and wounds			0
' now she loves throwing mud on herself immediately after a long bath - much to the annoyance of her keeper - and also throws mud on him when he is n't paying attention			1
' years to recover : the head of @entity14 said that it takes years to recover from @entity1 's decades - long ordeal today the nightmare for @entity1 and his herd is a distant memory			1
and they are also enjoying a rehabilitation pool thanks to the generosity of donors to the centre			0
mr @entity39 said : : we are overwhelmed by the generosity of people from so many countries around the globe			0
we hope that if the donations continue , better facilities can be established for @entity1 and the other elephants at the center who all deserve a better life to make up for the abuse they suffered all these years			1
' when we rescued him , @entity1 had never been in a pool before – and now he spends hours relaxing inside it			1
we 'd like to thank everyone who made a donation – every penny has made such a difference to the quality of his life			0
' and while the pool is immensely pleasurable for him , it also is helping his rehabilitation as the water 's buoyancy enables him to take the weight off his legs which are incredibly painful from years of being shackled			2
' he still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds			2
and sadly he 's not alone			0
we have a dossier of 80 elephants whose life is in imminent peril and they also need to be rescued before they die of cruelty , exhaustion and abuse			1
' now the charity has launched an appeal for £ 20,000 to mark @entity325 on august 12			0
mr @entity39 said : ' our hope is that along with @entity1 , we can rescue many more of these tragic cases before it 's too late for them			1
it will enable them to taste freedom for the first time in their lives and live out their days in dignity , free from suffering and pain			0
