by @entity0 for @entity1 when boxer @entity3 became a world cruiserweight champion in 1989 , he could hear the raucous applause of the crowd – but the faces of his thousands of fans were just a blur			1
indeed , until three months ago his vision was so poor that he likens his vision to being ‘ like opaque tights pulled over a camera lens ’			1
he admits cheating at eye tests to get his boxing licence – by memorising the letters on the chart			1
nice view : until three months ago , 49 - year - old ex-boxer @entity3 's vision ' like opaque tights pulled over a camera lens ' but thanks to an operation in may using a new type of laser , @entity3 now has near - perfect vision and says his life has changed immeasurably			1
‘ to be honest , at the @entity28 it did n’t bother me too much , ’ says @entity3 , 49 , who is now a @entity27 pundit			1
‘ all i was looking at was the face of my opponent , @entity31			0
‘ but i lived in the shadows for years			0
i could see clearly for just a couple of feet , then everything was blurred			0
by the time i had my operation i was convinced that i would never see the world clearly			0
’ sight problems run in the @entity3 family			1
three close relatives , including one of his sisters , are blind , but @entity3 ’s condition was more straightforward			1
he simply suffered from myopia – short - sightedness			0
the condition occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back			0
this means that light does n’t reach the retina but focuses too early , so distant objects become blurred			0
@entity3 ’s problems started when he was 12 and at school in @entity56 , @entity57			1
‘ i was a tough kid and wanted to sit at the back of the class with the cool lads , ’ he says			2
‘ the trouble is , i could n’t see a thing on the blackboard			0
’ his main concern was that his condition might prevent him from following a career in the ring – boxers need to have good eyesight for their own safety			0
‘ i ’d turn up for my regular eye test with a lovely chap called dr @entity73			2
he ’d ask about my parents , and i ’d ask about mrs @entity75			0
‘ in the meantime i ’d memorise the third line from the bottom of the chart			0
as he talked i ’d make sure i was standing near enough to see it , so i passed the test every time			0
’ so why did n’t @entity3 , who also fought @entity83 in 1991 for the @entity85 heavyweight title , not just wear glasses in secret ? ‘ if i ’d been spotted it would have ruined my career , ’ he replies			1
punched : @entity3 and @entity83 in the @entity85 heavyweight title fight in 1991 according to a survey by insurance firm @entity94 , more than half of those aged between 40 and 75 have not had a recent eye test , even though 41 per cent have noticed a deterioration in their sight			1
@entity3 was spurred into action only when he started to suffer from long - sightedness too three years ago			1
‘ now i could n’t even read a restaurant menu , ’ he says			2
’ finally , he underwent laser eye surgery , but to his disappointment , any improvement was short - lived			1
however , at a @entity106 dinner this year , @entity3 found himself sitting next to @entity107 , who works at @entity108			2
‘ he was watching me squinting at the menu			0
we got chatting and he told me about lens - replacement surgery			1
’ @entity3 underwent a ground - breaking procedure that uses a computer - guided ‘ femtosecond ’ laser to dissolve the lens with a remarkable level of precision , before it is replaced with an artificial one			1
first , anaesthetic drops numb the eye before a cone - shaped suction ring is applied to the eyeball , says consultant ophthalmologist @entity124 , who operated on @entity3			1
the laser is lowered and attached to the ring , and after a scan of the eye , two incisions are made – one is less than three millimetres , the other just one millimetre			2
the lens of the eye is broken up within the little bag where it sits			2
the patient is then given a local anaesthetic before the lens fragments are removed and a new intraocular lens is injected			0
on the train home afterwards , @entity3 telephoned @entity107			2
‘ i told him the colours were so vibrant and everything was so sharp			0
i am so happy to be able to see again			0
