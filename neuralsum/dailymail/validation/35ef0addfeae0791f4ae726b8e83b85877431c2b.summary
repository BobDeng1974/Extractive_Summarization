a pampering few hours spent at the hair salon can you make you feel like a million dollars			0
unfortunately , the bill at the end for a cut , colour and blow dry can feel like it is making a million dollar dent in your bank account			0
now , a hair salon is offering clients the option of investing in a hair ' savings account ' with weekly direct debit payments that can be used to pay for their hair appointments			1
starting from $ 20 per week , clients contribute regular payments to their fund , which they make a withdrawal from to pay for their salon service			1
rather than saving up for months to afford their hair appointment , clients opt in to invest as much as they want over the $ 20 minimum per week , depending on how ' high maintenance ' their hairstyle is			1
a platinum blonde requiring regular touch ups would contribute more per week than someone with a low - maintenance colour			0
weekly investment : the brand likens the regular contributions to a gym membership promotion : the @entity31 is currently available in 36 salons across @entity54 editor of cult beauty website @entity57 is the face of the new promotion , and likens the service to ' lay - by for your hair '			1
she says : ' the @entity63 will make large service bills a thing of the past by providing the opportunity for flexible payment options			0
' @entity54 women ( and men ) continue to seek financial efficiency within their lifestyle choices without wanting to compromise on service quality			2
' new or existing clients activate the service with an initial consultation to determine the type of services they require , and book in for regular appointments in advance			0
if the client wants additional services ( for example , stopping in for a blow dry , or extra highlights ) and they do n't have enough in their fund to cover the service , they can simply top it up with a one - off payment			2
accessible : @entity94 salon owner @entity93 ( pictured ) says the fund allows more customers to access premium hair fashion the promotion launched on march 6 in 36 toni&guy salons across @entity54 , with 90 clients already signed up			1
@entity101 , owner of @entity102 on @entity104 's @entity103 , is a client at the @entity106 's @entity94 salon and has activated her @entity31			0
' it means i do n't get hit with a $ 200 plus bill in one hit , ' she tells @entity111			0
' with budgeting $ 20 a week it makes my splurge at @entity19 a little easier with budgeting for a family of four			2
' @entity93 , @entity116 and @entity94 salon owner , adds : ' @entity19 are providing the opportunity for more @entity54 women ( and men ) to have access to premium hair fashion			2
' the @entity31 is expected to be expanded to all @entity54 salons , with a view to roll out the service worldwide .			1
