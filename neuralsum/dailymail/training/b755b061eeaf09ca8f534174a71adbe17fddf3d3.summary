by @entity0 published : 15:10 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 12 january 2013 in a remote corner of @entity2 lies a village unlike any other			1
the clay walls of the low buildings that make up @entity6 , @entity7 , have been decorated with elaborate frescoes and geometric patterns , turning each of the circular structures into a striking work of art. the isolated village is home to the royal court of the @entity17 people , one of the oldest ethnic groups in @entity7 , who first settled the region in the 15th century			1
it serves as the official residence of the pe , or community leader , of the @entity17 tribe			2
the clay walls of the buildings are covered with patterns to differentiate them from the homes of the common people , with the chief 's heavily decorated residence the @entity6 equivalent of a royal palace			2
but not all of the striking structures are lived in			0
some of the most elaborately patterned buildings are actually mausoleums for the dead , who are laid to rest in the same compound			0
rare glimpse : a tourist - free corner of @entity2 , the village keeps itself relatively isolated and closed to outsiders symbols : @entity58 etched upon the walls of one of the low buildings unchanged : the traditional houses in @entity24 are painted with geometric designs , symbols and icons village life : young children are seen among the traditional buildings decorated with intricate paintings despite its unique architecture @entity6 's @entity26 is not among @entity2 's well - trodden tourist destinations , with the villagers preferring to keep it isolated to ensure the conservation and integrity of their structures			1
but this looks set to change in the future , with plans afoot to develop the site as a cultural tourism destination as a means of generating cash to fund conservation			0
@entity6 , which is also at risk from flooding and subsequent erosion , has been placed on a watch list by the @entity92 , an organisation that works to preserve the world 's most treasured places			0
