everything they say about the @entity2 is true			1
the sea is breathtakingly cerulean blue , the sand as soft as flour			1
the air is so clear it feels like there might be a fourth dimension			1
the view from the sea plane is like a turquoise lava lamp as lagoons meet the ocean with swirls and circles of staggering beauty			1
and then , just as we start our descent to the little resort of @entity23 , in the @entity24 , a 40 - minute seaplane flight from the capital @entity27 , two yellow turtles swim sturdily towards a reef			1
sand as soft as flour and cerulean sea : @entity31 is hard pushed to find fault with her week in the @entity2 at the jetty , smiling staff give us cool towels and whisk us to our new home for a week - a superlative beachfront studio where a huge , modern sitting room looks out on to an infinity pool , a strip of brilliant white sand and that ridiculously blue sea			1
look the other way and stepping stones lead through green foliage to a table and chairs while to one side is an outside shower surrounded by banana plants			1
frankly , the place is bigger than my flat			1
it 's hardly surprising the @entity2 have been on the top ten of honeymoon destinations for years			1
you could easily spend much of your time getting all hot , bothered and arduous in the splendour of your well - appointed villa			1
but there is much more to do than gaze at sumptuousness			1
obviously , with miles of sea to play in , you can swim , snorkel , canoe , scuba dive and sail			1
there is also a high - tech games room where you can learn or practice golf , shooting , tennis or whatever			1
essentially , though , you 're here to relax			1
the days unwind quietly for @entity31 , with snorkelling , visits to the spa and walks around the island we take a boat about a third of a mile offshore to the sensational music venue @entity81 , which is six metres ( 20ft ) under the sea			1
as the sun sets , we have cocktails at @entity85 , the restaurant above			2
light spills on to the man - made coral reef			2
stars dapple the night sky			2
a slight breeze ruffles the balmy air			2
' it 's like the set of a @entity97 film , ' says my rapt companion			2
' we need someone stroking a white cat to say , " here 's your mojito , mr @entity97			2
i expect you to die			2
" ' @entity85 's executive chef ( an @entity109 named @entity108 ) serves up exquisite food			1
i 've never had an amuse bouche which amused the bouche so thoroughly			2
@entity113 , coconut caviar and a salmon square			2
i could have eaten the plate			2
eleven hours later , it 's off along the sandy paths to breakfast			0
the selection is amazing , from miso soup and curry to steamed vegetables , rice pudding and fruit			0
a sailing trip on a dhoni , an old @entity2 boat ( left ) is the icing on the cake			0
even the fruit bats are happy ( right ) actually , i 'm not going to mention the food any more			1
suffice to say that not only will you not starve or suffer from lack of variety , you will eat some of the most gorgeous food you 've ever tasted			1
meanwhile , some of us need a massage			0
you 'd be hard pushed to find a more beautiful spa than the @entity141			0
there 's driftwood and teakwood , white stepping stones and crystal clear water with floating glass globes , surrounded by lush foliage			0
fruit bats hang upside down in the trees , cuckoos gently coo and a sweet reef shark bimbles along in the shallows as the sea tickles the shore			0
in the evening , we walk along the beach to the rooftop @entity159 bar and have a green coconut			0
below , tiny lights sparkle in the pool while above is a canopy of stars			0
bimble away : a reef shark is one of the many creatures @entity31 encounters during her stay in the @entity2 clusters of paper lanterns light our way home			0
we go snorkelling with @entity175 , the resident marine biologist			1
there are myriad coloured fish and also groupers and black tipped reef sharks			0
but the revelation is the beauty of the giant clams - bright blue , red , green and yellow ones			0
' the different colours are down to the salts and the algae , ' she tells us			0
at dinner that night in @entity191 , we sit with our feet in the sand , our way lit by candles and sconces			0
there 's a full moon and the water gently thripples the shore			0
can it get much better ? yes , it can			0
@entity203 , our butler , comes to tell us that we can go out for a sail with captain @entity205 on a dhoni , an old @entity2 boat with a spacious bedroom , which is beautifully appointed with dark wood and a thatched roof			0
we lounge on a giant orange beanbag at the front and watch dolphins frolic and flying fish fly as the sun sets and the champagne bottle goes down			0
the next morning , it 's all over			0
we fly back to @entity27 and westward home			0
why do holidays have to end ? @entity220 ( 01244 355 527 ) offers seven nights ' half board at @entity23 from £ 2,385pp based on two adults sharing a @entity224 , including return flights and transfers			1
valid for travel completed between april 13 and september 19 , 2015 .			0
