' supporters of mr @entity9 , who reached the rank of detective chief inspector and enjoyed the trust of @entity3 ’s parents @entity37 and @entity39 , claim he was cruelly forced out of the @entity10 as part of its drive to cut costs			1
they also say his departure reflects the force ’s dwindling interest in @entity3 ’ s case , which has cost the force tens of millions of pounds in terms of different investigations , public inquiries and compensation to the black teenager ’s family			0
loss : @entity3 was 18 when he was stabbed to death near a bus stop in @entity57 , south - east @entity58 , in april 1993 , in a racist attack by a gang of white youths @entity3 ’s close friend @entity62 , who witnessed his murder , says he has lost confidence in the @entity10 as a result of mr @entity67 ’s enforced departure in may			1

but mr @entity9 said there had been officers inside the @entity10 who did not want a ' successful prosecution '			1
he told @entity94 ’s @entity93 programme : ' there were certainly people i think in senior levels in the @entity10 that were n’t enthusiastic about the investigation			1

i would like to see everyone involved convicted , ’ he said			0

mr @entity3 will need some persuasion that is being vigorously pursued			0

‘ if mr @entity9 is saying there were attempts to derail the ( most recent ) murder investigation , then i would consider that to be new , ’ she added			1
