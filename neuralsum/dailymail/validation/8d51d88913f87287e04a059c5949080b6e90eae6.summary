@entity1 ’s dapper cup final suit was ruined , drenched in the champagne poured over him by his elated players			1
but he did n’t care one bit			0
‘ they can tip champagne over me any day of the week if we win , ’ laughed the thrilled @entity6 manager			1
after all , this is @entity6 ’s season			1
they ’re coasting to the @entity13 title and , with a handsome piece of silverware already in the cabinet , the good times have returned to @entity17			0
@entity1 and @entity18 look delighted after winning the trophy and @entity6 could now clinch the double captain @entity21 ( centre ) lifts the @entity23 as his @entity6 team - mates celebrate @entity25 ( 2 ) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at the full back celebrates in front of the @entity6 fans after he doubled his side 's lead this was as straightforward as a @entity38 final gets			1
they lifted the @entity23 in front of 40,000 jubilant @entity41 after goals from @entity43 and @entity25 saw off @entity45 ’s meek challenge			1
but this was merely a taste of things to come			0
with a 10 - point advantage over their nearest league challengers @entity49 , @entity6 will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet @entity45 , in the last game of the season on may 3			2
like so often during this campaign , they were in control from start to finish , showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances			2
now comes the task of crossing the finish line and completing a double but it would take a collapse of spectacular proportions to deny them a return to the @entity71 after two seasons away			0
‘ hopefully this can push us on to finish the season off , ’ said @entity1 , who also enjoyed @entity38 success in the @entity75 final with hometown club @entity76			1
‘ the one thing they have experienced today is that 30 - 40 minutes of euphoria and it ’s really important to feel that early in your career			2
‘ we have a fixation now — we just want to win the league			2
' @entity43 ( left ) scores the opening goal for @entity6 during the @entity90 the big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at @entity38 for @entity6 the 50 - year - old appears to be on a mission to put the @entity95 on the footballing map , saying the area had been starved of success			1
‘ they play a lot of rugby at school , so for the football teams to achieve success is good for the kids in the area , ’ he added in a cheeky dig at the real king of sports in the region			0
days like this will certainly help inspire the next generation of @entity6 fans			2
once the flames and pyrotechnics had faded at @entity38 , the favourites immediately seized control			2
their enormous following only had to wait 15 minutes for the breakthrough when @entity43 outmuscled his marker to head home @entity123 ’s corner at the back post			1
it seemed a second @entity6 goal would settle a game lacking in entertainment and it duly arrived six minutes after the break			1
@entity131 ’s dancing feet worked space for a cross down the left and though goalkeeper @entity135 blocked @entity25 ’s initial header , the right back bundled home with his knee			1
both @entity131 and @entity25 were excellent , causing constant problems for the @entity45 back line			1
that moment was a fitting reward for their efforts			0
fans make thier way into the stadium prior to the cup final where @entity6 came away as winners @entity151 is joined by his team - mates and goalscorers @entity43 , and @entity25 to pose for a photo @entity21 lifts the trophy high towards the @entity6 fans after comfortably winning the competition at @entity38 @entity45 were disappointing , but things might have turned out differently had @entity158 not turned @entity160 ’s vicious cross on to the post moments after the second goal			1
‘ i just felt if we scored at any time it would have given us that lift , ’ said @entity164 boss @entity163			0
‘ i ’m proud of getting here but disappointed with the result			0
’ for @entity6 , you sense , this success was merely an appetiser for greater glories to come			2
other things that caught me eye proof , from the @entity71 , that referees can redeem themselves from cases of mistaken identity			0
when @entity182 captain @entity181 handled on the line at @entity184 , official @entity180 wrongly dismissed @entity185			0
but after a consultation , he returned and made the correct decision			0
@entity188 has been impressive all season but he excelled himself with an outrageous backheel finish during @entity192 ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity193			0
that was the former @entity196 striker ’s 19th goal of the campaign and helped @entity199 ’s team move within two points of the automatic promotion places .			0

@entity43 gave @entity6 the lead at @entity38 after 15 minutes with a towering header at the far post
@entity25 doubled the lead when he bundled the ball into the net with *replays* showing it hit his hand
@entity1 's side *deserved* the win over the 90 minutes and lifted the @entity23
@entity6 will now concentrate on winning promotion back to the championship
