@entity1 ’s @entity0 had to settle for a silver medal in her judo final last night but her household still took home one gold medal when husband @entity6 triumphed for @entity7 a few minutes later			1
@entity0 , 27 , insisted she had failed : ‘ i came here for one thing only and that was the gold so i ’m disappointed with myself			1
’ but some consolation arrived within a few minutes , watching from the sidelines as @entity7 ’s opening ceremony flag - bearer @entity6 overpowered @entity14 of @entity15 in the -100kg division			1
a beam crossed @entity0 ’s face and she shed a few tears of pride			1
happy : @entity21 poses with her medal after the final win gutted : but @entity0 looked dejected with silver delight : it 's a great moment for @entity21 as she takes gold but @entity0 will be gutted finishing on top : @entity0 is held on the ground during her final bout with @entity31 grappling : @entity0 and @entity31 get to grips with each other in a close contest on friday night then , as @entity6 stood talking to journalists about the relief of landing his own target , his wife behind him , patting him playfully on the bottom as a first gesture of ‘ well done ’ before walking away without another word			1
the pair started this games with dreams of leaving @entity45 2014 as a golden couple			2
@entity0 wanted to go one better than the silver she won so emotionally at @entity48			1
there she dropped to dropped to her knees after her semi-final , looked skywards and whispered ‘ i love you , @entity53 ’			2
her mum had died eight years previously , when @entity0 was 17			1
she came here on the back of fresh adversity — serious wrist , shoulder and ankle @entity60 ’s @entity48 could not have ended more despondently as he lost in the first round when hoping to go all the way to gold			1
in a memorably frank and downbeat interview at the time , he said : ‘ i ’ve let myself down , let my coaches down , let everybody i ’ve ever trained with down , let my mum and dad down			2
’ flying @entity73 : @entity74 celebrates his win against @entity15 's @entity14 domination : @entity74 holds @entity14 on the ground during their -100kg final clash at the @entity80 mixed emotions : @entity0 was gutted to only get silver but she was pleased to see her husband grab gold now it was @entity86 with the self - criticism			1
‘ that was n’t good i ’m afraid , ’ she said of her final defeat to @entity89 ’s @entity21			1
‘ i was n’t the better player today			2
it ’s not good enough			2
i know i can still be the best in the country and the best in the world otherwise i would n’t be training every day			2
‘ this might have been a little bit soon for me but you can always say that			0
‘ yes , i ’ve had injuries and only been back a month or so after the shoulder op but i was n’t good enough today			0
’ @entity6 had effectively quit after @entity102 but changed his mind nine months ago and decided to try and win gold on home soil			1
he confirmed last night he would never fight again and was going out on a high			0
‘ it ’s pretty amazing , ’ he said of his win			0
‘ it probably has n’t set in yet but it ’s been a nervous day all round today			0
’ he fought and beat three opponents in the morning to earn his final			1
‘ the pressure is on right from the beginning of the day , my first - round opponent i got rid of pretty quickly , ’ he said			2
‘ most people might think that ’s a good thing but actually it means you ’ve not spent much time on the mat so you ’re still nervous for the second one			0
‘ my second fight i was n’t particularly good if i ’m being honest , really struggled			0
and it was three fights in quite quick succession this morning because this weight category is n’t massively deep			0
three matches in 90 minutes was tough			0
’ his overwhelming emotion , he insisted , was relief			0
‘ later and tomorrow it ’ll start to become a bit a pride and excitement but it ’s relief at the moment , ’ he said			0
‘ this does n’t make up for @entity102			0
i ’ve worked my whole life to try and be @entity140 champion and i fell short of it in both olympic games i made .			0
