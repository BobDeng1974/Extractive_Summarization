the opening title sequence of the @entity1 is about to finish when @entity3 ’s mobile phone lights up with text messages from former @entity6 players			1
there is a sense of betrayal , an injustice after their former team - mate @entity11 claimed he ruled the old dressing rooms at @entity14 by fear and intimidation			1
‘ i was the leader , ’ he announced			0
‘ let me tell you a bit about @entity22 because those players would n’t have followed him down the pub , ’ scoffed @entity3 as he watched the 90 - minute documentary screened by @entity18 on @entity19			1
@entity3 with the original @entity26 in the early 1980s @entity3 says he guided @entity6 up through the leagues with players who worked hard @entity3 celebrates with @entity29 after @entity6 's victory in the @entity31 against @entity32 @entity3 is a proud man and this film has wounded him			1
the @entity1 could and probably should have been the fairytale , the real , gritty story of @entity6 ’s remarkable rise from champions of the @entity38 in 1977 to @entity31 winners 11 giddy years later			1
‘ none of the players cried , it ’s complete nonsense , ’ added their former manager			0
‘ @entity11 has betrayed us			1
’ there is no mention at all of @entity3 ’s masterplan to replicate the success of @entity52 ’s @entity51 side of the @entity53 , or the 13 homegrown players he promoted from the youth team during his six - and - a - half years as manager			1
the likes of @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and captain @entity62 have been forgotten , consigned to history			0
instead they have been portrayed as a team of thugs			0
@entity3 , who was among those paid to appear in the programme , added : ‘ @entity69 has disrespected the legend of the club and the legacy has been tarnished because of his contribution to the programme			1
‘ he has embellished stories and played up to the camera			1
he should have been honest and shown respect to those who played alongside him and to those who achieved so much before him			0
@entity11 and @entity82 played up to @entity6 's reputation as a team of thugs in the documentary @entity3 is proud of the job he did at @entity6 but does n't believe the documentary reflected them properly @entity3 and @entity11 walk on the beach during their days at @entity6 - but the manager says his former striker has embellished a lot of the stories ‘ it is a shame and players from that great @entity6 team are very disappointed in him because he has attempted to glamorise something that was already very special			1
‘ i am still really proud of what we all achieved , but @entity69 has tucked us all up			0
‘ everything that team went on to achieve , even after i left and @entity104 won the @entity31 with them a year later , is unlikely to be repeated			1
’ @entity3 signed @entity106 , who had been released by @entity107 and rejected by @entity108 and @entity109 , on the recommendation of his young forward @entity111			1
he was eventually sold to @entity112 for £ 1.6m and went on to play for @entity113 21 times			0
goalkeeper @entity115 , who saved @entity117 ’s penalty in the @entity31 final , went to @entity119 for £ 850,000			1
@entity120 went to @entity121 for the same fee			0
‘ @entity22 has made it sound like we were animals , but we worked hard on the training ground and had some very good players , ’ added @entity3 , who took over the @entity6 team when @entity125 left for @entity109 in 1981			1
‘ it was n’t an environment where people were bullied or intimidated at all			0
‘ every team had their enforcers			0
@entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 could all look after themselves at @entity138			0
@entity139 had @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
it was a different era and they were all tough			0
’ @entity106 , in the transcript of his two - and - a - half - hour interview with the programme makers , backs up @entity3 ’s passionate version of events			2
‘ the players enjoyed the environment , ’ said @entity106			0
‘ they did n’t feel embarrassed if they messed it up			0
they did n’t think they were better than each other			0
@entity3 insists that @entity6 were not the only side with physical players in their side @entity82 was sent off against @entity160 after clashing with @entity161 @entity82 has to be restrained by @entity11 at @entity162 in a game that ended 1 - 1 @entity11 made a lot of claims in the @entity18 documentary which have been disputed by others like @entity11 , @entity82 was one of the players who glamourised the violent side of @entity6 ‘ you could miss a volley or have a joke and no one felt uncomfortable			1
there ’s nothing worse than going to a group and you ’re feeling the pressure			0
’ the story about @entity180 ’s car being set on fire to claim on insurance after @entity3 refused to give him a pay rise is fiction , according to @entity3			2
so , too , are the images of @entity186 being tied to the luggage rack of a car and being driven down the @entity189 at high speed by one of the @entity6 players			2
‘ it just did n’t happen like that , ’ added @entity3			2
so much for the intimidation and the wanton acts of violence that @entity11 , who was signed by @entity3 from @entity198 in 1986 , and @entity82 talk about during the film			1
‘ nobody died , ’ added @entity11 when he was asked about the @entity1 ’s methods			1
it is a remark that disgusts @entity3			2
so much more could have been made of @entity3 ’s stats man @entity203 , sitting in the draughty stands to faithfully record free kicks , corners and long throws			2
there is no mention , either , of the £ 11,000 @entity3 spent on video equipment for his analyst @entity211			2
@entity3 beat @entity212 by 20 years			1
sadly , @entity106 ’s anecdotes about coach @entity214 showing the team tapes of @entity218 ’s magnificent @entity217 side , with @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 in their pomp , were left on the cutting room floor			0
@entity3 signed @entity106 in 1985 on the recommendation of @entity111 former @entity6 captain @entity62 was not mentioned in the documentary while @entity11 is accused of fabricating and making up some of the things that went on at @entity6 instead the temptation , inevitably , was to lap up the numerous tales readily supplied by @entity11 and @entity82 about techniques they claimed to have used as @entity6 players			1
you ca n’t blame them			0
instead , @entity11 and @entity82 have much to answer for after this bruising appraisal of @entity6 ’s glory years			1
‘ when @entity11 arrived at the club he told the dressing room , “ i am not in the @entity1 , do not cut up my clothes and i wo n’t cut up yours ” , ’ added @entity3			1
‘ he wanted no part in it , he was very much on his own in there at the beginning			0
’ to the producer and director ’s great credit , @entity11 ’s ability to embellish the truth is brilliantly exposed during the programme ’s reflections on the 1988 fa cup final against @entity138			2
‘ @entity258 is close friend and i said things to him in that tunnel that only a black man could say to another black man , ’ claimed @entity11 in a particularly awkward scene			2
the next shot is of the tunnel , with the two teams lined up together and filmed live for @entity266 and @entity267 before referee @entity268 leads the teams out			0
there is no hint of any exchanges between the two teams and @entity258 confirms this in his own interview			0
‘ @entity69 made himself look like a buffoon , ’ added @entity3			2
@entity6 completed their remarkable fairy tale when they won the @entity31 in 1988 under @entity104 @entity277 celebrates his winning goal in the cup final as @entity115 raises the @entity31 he is also disappointed with @entity82 , the man he signed from @entity280 for £ 10,000 in 1986 and turned into a @entity282 midfielder			1
there is no mention of the winner he scored on his home debut against @entity287 or his spell out of the team after he was sent off for sticking one on former @entity292 midfielder @entity291			0
‘ so much for the intimidation , the verbals and all this fighting because after he got sent off i did n’t play him again until the end of the season as a punishment , ’ @entity3 added			2
then there is the story , after @entity3 left the club , of the unfortunate soul who was beaten to within an inch of his life by @entity11 behind closed doors			1
that man was @entity309 , a journeyman striker who made the mistake of accepting @entity11 ’s challenge to a fight after they had finished training one day			2
‘ his name was left out , probably because he did n’t want to be associated with it , ’ said @entity3			0
after watching this film , it is clear @entity3 and many of the other former @entity6 players now feel the same way .			1

former @entity6 manager @entity3 is upset with how his former club were portrayed in the @entity18 documentary
@entity3 says @entity11 embellished stories and played up to the camera in the @entity1 documentary
@entity6 rose from @entity38 champions in 1977 to @entity31 winners at @entity332 11 years later
