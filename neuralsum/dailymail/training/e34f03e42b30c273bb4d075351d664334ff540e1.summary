by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 14:15 est , 8 february 2013 @entity2 were left to carry out their own safety checks on the lithium batteries that have grounded all their dreamliner jets as there were no federal guidelines in existence at the time , it has emerged			1
when the disaster - stricken airliner was in development , @entity2 was granted what the @entity14 called ' special conditions , ' for its planned use of the new lithium technology			1
by the time official guidelines for the batteries were created in 2008 , the @entity19 had already been approved so it did not have to meet them			1
tailbacks : dreamliners are seen parked nose - to - tail near the @entity2 factory in @entity27 , @entity28			1
the manufacturer has admitted delivery of the jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns an investigation into last month 's battery fire in a @entity19 ' while it was parked in @entity35 , shows it began with multiple short - circuits in one of the battery 's eight cells			1
the results so far contradict some of the assumptions that were made about the battery 's safety at the time the system won government approval , said the board 's chairwoman , @entity47			2
the @entity50 investigation shows the fire started with multiple short - circuits in one of the battery 's eight cells , she said			2
that created an uncontrolled chemical reaction known as ' thermal runaway , ' which is characterized by progressively hotter temperatures			0
that spread the short - circuiting to the rest of the cells and caused the fire , she said			0
the findings are at odds with what @entity2 told the @entity14 when that agency was working to certify the company 's newest and most technologically advanced plane for flight , @entity47 said			1
@entity2 said its testing showed that even when trying to induce short - circuiting , the condition and any fire were contained within a single cell , preventing thermal runaway and fire from spreading , she told reporters at a news conference			2
@entity2 's testing also showed the batteries were likely to cause smoke in only 1 in 10 million flight hours , she said			2
link : investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery to that suffered by a battery on another @entity19 which was also forced to make an emergency landing in @entity35 last month charred : a cat scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery 's eight cells were all but destroyed but the @entity35 fire was followed nine days later by a smoking battery in an @entity99 plane that made an emergency landing in @entity101			1
the 787 fleet has recorded less than 100,000 flight hours , @entity47 noted			2
the plane that caught fire in @entity35 was delivered to @entity19 less than three weeks before the fire and had recorded only 169 flight hours over 22 flights			1
' there have now been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart on two different aircraft , ' @entity47 said			2
' this investigation has demonstrated that a short circuit in a single cell can propagate to adjacent cells and result in smoke and fire			0
the assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered			2
' battery experts said @entity2 could try to build more safeguards into the battery by using a greater number of smaller cells and putting more insulation between them			1
or , they said , the aircraft maker could switch to a different type of lithium ion battery already approved for aviation			2
some business jets use lithium ion batteries as their main batteries			0
switching to another type of battery , such as lead - acid or nickel - cadmium battery , is another possibility , but that would involve changing the charging system as well , they said			0
deliveries of @entity2 's dreamliner passenger jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns , the troubled manufacturer has admitted			1
@entity2 currently has orders for around 800 787s , however all 50 of the problematic planes already supplied to airlines remain grounded until a serious battery issue is fixed			1
battery malfunctions led to a fire on board a parked @entity19 ( @entity154 ) 787 in @entity35 and an in - flight problem on another plane in @entity101 which was forced to make an emergency landing			1
@entity158 is considering dropping @entity160 batteries and switching back to traditional units on its new @entity163 aircraft as safety investigators probe battery incidents on @entity2 's @entity166 , several people familiar with the matter said			1
the move comes amid a wider rethink in the aerospace industry on whether the powerful but delicate backup energy systems are technically ' mature ' , they said			0
an @entity158 spokesman said the company would study and evaluate the outcome of the ongoing @entity178 battery investigation			0
' let 's not get ahead of ourselves ' , he said			0
@entity158 said last week it had a plan b and time to respond to any rule @entity183 's @entity182 , which makes both the new and old generation of batteries for @entity158 , did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
one operator , @entity189 , which is due to launch a long - haul service , said it now plans to lease other aircraft to replace the 787s they have on order			0
@entity2 had warned the @entity189 that deliveries were uncertain because of the investigation by the @entity50 ( @entity50 )			1
the carrier said in a statement this morning : ' the extent of a possible delay and whether such delay will affect later deliveries is presently not known			0
' @entity202 is taking precautionary steps by planning for substitute aircraft capacity			0
' earlier today the @entity14 cleared @entity2 to restart test flights of its grounded @entity166 in order to get more data on potentially faulty batteries			1
the groundings have cost airlines tens of millions of dollars , and there appears to be no end in sight			0
@entity189 , which is aiming to take on established airlines in the overseas sector , was due to take delivery of eight @entity217 in april			0
the firm had already sold a number of discounted tickets for its first overseas flights			0
they added : ' in the event that the 787 is not operational in time for @entity202 's services to @entity226 and @entity227 replacement long - haul aircraft will be leased to ensure flights are operated as scheduled			2
' on thursday a one - off flight was approved to move a 787 from @entity230 to @entity28 , where @entity2 is based for examination			1
the introduction of the @entity19 has been fraught with difficulties from the start			2
the first three 787s were found to be overweight			0
there were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the development of the on board software			0
test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and @entity243 was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time			1
positive step : @entity2 has been given permission to carry out fresh test flights with the @entity166 jet in june 2010 @entity2 stunned the aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after engineers discovered structural flaws			1
then in november that year a test flight had to make an emergency landing in @entity256 , @entity230 , after crew notice smoke in the cabin			1
earlier this week images of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in @entity101 were released			0
pictures released by the @entity263 showed the blackened lithium device with frayed and broken earth wire			2
investigators are trying to establish the cause of an in - flight fire which forced an @entity99 flight to make an emergency landing in @entity101 last month			1
@entity272 scans of the overheated lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week earlier on january 7 which saw another @entity19 make an emergency landing in @entity35			1
the latest probe is said to have found evidence of short - circuiting and ' thermal runaway ' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating			0
pilots and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the batteries on board at all if the plane 's battery system makes it too unsafe to fly			0
the @entity19 is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium - ion batteries			1
they charge faster and can be better moulded to space - saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries			0
@entity297 , chief engineer on the 787 , said last month that the plane 's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault			0
he said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures ' do n't put the airplane at risk ' .			0

@entity2 admits deliveries of new @entity19 jets will be delayed
troubled manufacturer currently has orders for around 800 787s
all 50 planes already supplied remain grounded until battery issue is fixed
@entity2 cleared to restart test flights to try and solve the problem
pictures of burnt out battery from @entity99 787 revealed
@entity19 was forced to make an emergency landing on january 16
investigators have taken device apart to figure out what went wrong
they have linked emergency landing to similar incident in @entity35
