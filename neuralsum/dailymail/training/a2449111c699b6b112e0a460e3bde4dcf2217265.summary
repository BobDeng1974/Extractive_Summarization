prince @entity0 has expressed serious concern about the impact of ‘ rushed ’ @entity3 plans to change ancient laws governing the royal line of succession			1
friends told the @entity7 that he believes altering the rules that give male heirs priority and bar members of the @entity11 from marrying @entity12 could have ‘ unintended consequences ’ that have not been properly considered			1
he is understood to have raised a series of critical questions in a private meeting with one of @entity19 ’s most senior mandarins last month			1
but according to a well - placed source , he believes the potential consequences for the delicate relationship between the state and the @entity40 , as well as for the rules governing other hereditary titles , have not been thought through			1
in a meeting with @entity44 , permanent secretary at the @entity45 , the @entity0 is said to have raised concerns about what will happen if his grandchild is allowed to marry a @entity12 , as the government proposes			1
church leaders have previously expressed concern that if a future heir to the throne married a @entity12 , their children would be required by canon law to be brought up in that faith			0
ultimately , that could lead to the constitutional nightmare of an heir to the throne , due to become the @entity61 , being a @entity12 and therefore barred from being crowned			0
according to the source , the @entity0 was told the situation could be resolved by negotiations with the @entity65 if it arose - a response he is said to have found ‘ unsatisfactory and unconvincing ’			1
he also raised questions about the potential impact of changing the rules of royal succession for other titles that are currently passed down the male line			1
already , several senior figures have raised the prospect of changing peerage law so that female heirs can succeed to the hereditary peerage			2
some daughters of the gentry are calling for equal rights to inherit titles , arguing that the new law will leave them ‘ two steps behind ’ the @entity84			2
such a move would cause turmoil in some of the country ’s most aristocratic families			0
the disclosure of the @entity0 ’s reservations is a serious blow to the government ’s plans to change royal succession law			1
though the issue was first raised by @entity97 more than a decade ago , @entity95 struck an agreement with the 15 other countries where the @entity31 is head of state that the rules must be overhauled			2
mr @entity95 told other @entity102 leaders that in an age of ‘ gender equality ’ , the @entity105 , which also bars members of the @entity11 from marrying @entity12 , is out of date and discriminatory			2
the issue was given fresh significance by the announcement of the @entity28 's pregnancy @entity111 looks ahead to grandchild and speaks of pride of @entity114 battling the ' nasties ' there had been growing fears in @entity119 and @entity19 circles of controversy if the @entity27 and @entity28 have a daughter who would be overtaken in line for the throne by any future male siblings			1
in @entity126 , the @entity125 was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when @entity130 and @entity131 had a girl , @entity132 , princess @entity132 , who is their only child			2
the issue was given fresh urgency by the announcement of the @entity28 ’s pregnancy last month			0
deputy prime minister @entity136 , who is responsible for the issue at the @entity45 , immediately announced that the government intended to rush through legislation using procedures usually reserved for anti-terror laws			0
the change will need to be legislated for in all 16 @entity102 realms - the @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , the @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 , @entity157 , the @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity161 and @entity162			2
the changes mean that for all descendants of the @entity0 , a younger son will no longer take precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession			1
@entity95 told other @entity102 leaders that in an age of ' gender equality ' , the 1701 @entity105 , which also bars members of the @entity11 from marrying @entity12 , is out of date and discriminatory members of the @entity11 who marry a @entity12 will also in future be able to succeed to the @entity175 , and an ancient rule that means all descendants of @entity178 are supposed to gain the consent of the @entity180 to marry will also be scrapped and now apply only to the first six people in the line of succession			1
the 1701 @entity105 means that only the @entity183 heirs of @entity184 , granddaughter of @entity185 , can become @entity180 or @entity31			0
it also gives precedence to male heirs			0
the @entity105 was drawn up in an era of religious strife to ensure the @entity183 succession			0
but it has increasingly been condemned as discriminatory against both @entity12 and women in the modern world			0
@entity193 , wife of the @entity31 ’s grandson @entity194 , renounced her catholic faith so her husband could retain his place as 11th in line to the throne after their wedding in 2008			0
other @entity84 , including prince @entity202 , the @entity31 ’s first cousin , have given up their claim to the throne in order to marry @entity12			0
@entity12 are divided on the reform , with some hoping it will ultimately lead to the total repeal of the @entity105 , which bars @entity12 from the throne			0
but former @entity210 minister @entity209 , a @entity12 , has previously expressed concern , saying : ‘ if we get rid of the provision that the heir to the throne and the @entity180 ca n’t marry a @entity12 , we will undermine the link between the @entity216 and the @entity40 which will threaten the establishment of the @entity40 , taking with it our last figleaf that we are a @entity222 country			0
’ concerns about the rule of male succession were raised with the birth of the @entity227 to the @entity228 and @entity229			1
he was installed in the royal line of succession ahead of his sister , @entity232 , who is four years older than him			1
@entity234 was said to have agreed that the time had come to launch a concerted effort to change the law , even though that will mean legislation having to be overhauled or introduced in countries across the world			0
a senior @entity3 source said : ‘ the idea that the government would move one inch on this without the @entity234 being on board is ridiculous			0
’ a @entity45 spokesman added : ‘ we would never comment on exchanges between the government and the @entity0			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' any change in the law is a matter for the government			1
if and when the @entity0 meets with senior civil servants it is always documented properly in the @entity255			2
issues discussed in those meetings are private			0
' the publication of the @entity259 last month revealed the complexity of the changes that will be required to ensure that the @entity27 and @entity28 of @entity30 ’s child , due later this year , will be @entity180 regardless of sex			0
as well as the @entity105 , several other @entity264 , including the @entity265 , which was written in @entity266 and is one of the oldest laws on the statute book , will have to be amended to ensure that causing the death of a first - born daughter of the @entity180 , as well as a son , will be considered treason			2
