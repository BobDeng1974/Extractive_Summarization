by @entity0 published : 18:48 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 18:48 est , 24 august 2013 @entity2 pressure : labour leader @entity3 education secretary @entity4 has accused @entity3 of threatening to impose a £ 40 million ‘ @entity9 ’ on voters by forcing them to pick up the bill for running @entity8 ’s political parties			1
in an outspoken attack , mr @entity4 says mr @entity3 ’s recent call for a ban on political donations of more than £ 5,000 from individuals would inevitably lead to state funding for the conservatives , @entity17 and @entity18			1
and he argues mr @entity3 ’s proposal is primarily designed to deflect attention from the row over the way that @entity17 is bankrolled by unions such as @entity25 ’s @entity24			1
mr @entity4 , increasingly seen as a possible successor to @entity27 as @entity29 leader , claims mr @entity3 is trying to revive plans by the last @entity31 to introduce state funding of political parties			1
‘ there are few dirtier monetary transactions than politicians agreeing to pick the pockets of people poorer than themselves to fund activities which should be supported voluntarily , ’ writes mr @entity4 in today ’s @entity34			2
‘ that is the position @entity17 is now embracing – call it what you will , a spin tax , a “ @entity9 ” , a “ going to the poll ” tax – it ’s all the same thing ... more taxes to pay for more politicians spending more of your money			2
‘ hard - working people pay enough tax ... but if @entity3 gets his way you will be forced to pay for him			0
’ striker : @entity4 ( front row , left ) on the picket line during the year - long strike at @entity61 and @entity62 newspaper in 1989 as a cub reporter @entity29 sources say the £ 40 million ‘ @entity9 ’ is based on the 2011 @entity66 review of party funding which said a £ 10,000 cap could lead to a shortfall of more than £ 20 million a year			2
they say that would double under mr @entity3 ’s £ 5,000 cap			1
in a keynote speech on tuesday , mr @entity4 plans to make a wider attack on @entity17 ’s links to the unions			1
but he will deny the @entity16 are anti-union and recall his own experience as a striker			0
the education secretary , who has denounced ‘ bigotry ’ in teaching unions for holding back children by staging industrial action , walked out while working on a regional newspaper in 1989			0
he claimed that he ‘ did n’t agree ’ with the walkout but as a cub reporter and new union member he felt duty bound to join the picket line			0
mr @entity3 says the £ 5,000 cap is vital to stop rich @entity29 supporters making donations of tens of thousands of pounds to gain access and influence in the @entity16			0
behind the scenes : @entity25 , general secretary of the union unite , is trying to secure enough @entity17 members to deliver his agenda mr @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity9 ’ jibe will be seen as an attempt to counter damaging @entity17 attacks on the @entity29 over the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’ and other controversial levies dubbed the ‘ granny tax ’ and the ‘ pasty tax ’			1
mr @entity27 has suggested a £ 50,000 cap on donations			0
a @entity17 official said : ‘ the @entity29 have plucked the figure of £ 40 million from the air			0
the public is appalled by the way the rich can buy their way on to the top table of the @entity16			0
‘ @entity17 is taking steps to reform its relationship with the unions and the @entity29 should clean up their own backyard before criticising us			2

@entity3 ’s proposal is designed to deflect attention from the way that @entity17 is bankrolled by unions such as @entity25 ’s @entity24
@entity4 has accused @entity3 of try to revive plans by the last @entity31 to introduce state funding of political parties
