there are certain events in my life that i know never would have happened if i ’d been born ugly			1
real life - changing events to which i entirely owe my looks			1
i am not being conceited or boastful ; it ’s a simple fact that had i not been quite so lucky in the great dna lottery many doors would have remained shut to me			1
the first example is winning my first column on a newspaper in 2003 — which in turn led to my first book			1
‘ she ’s so pretty			1
’ this proclamation was given to the team out of my earshot , i should say , but relayed to me by one of them over lunch afterwards			1
it left me torn between being offended that i did n’t get the job because of my ability to write and thrilled to have a column			1
but in the cut - throat world of journalism there is no room for the feminist moral high ground			1
a column is a column , whatever it takes to get it			2
i should think acting is even more competitive			2
so i was rather surprised to read recently that @entity54 laments the fact that she misses out on roles because she is too pretty			1
i would wager she has won many more roles than she ’s lost due to her good looks			1
@entity54 laments the fact that she misses out on roles because she is too pretty			1
' i would wager she has won many more roles than she 's lost due to her good looks , ' says @entity20 and would you rather be cast as @entity63 ? do you hear @entity64 moaning about the fact that he could have become an accountant if he had n’t been so darned handsome ? i am not doing a @entity67			1
she famously triggered a storm of abuse in april 2012 for saying how gorgeous she was , and that other women hated her because she was so beautiful			2
i do n’t think i ’m so stunning other women loathe me en masse			2
and i ’m not so pleased with myself that every time i look in the mirror i think ‘ yippee ’			2
i used to loathe the way i looked			2
my legs were so thin when i was a teenager i used to wear two pairs of trousers to make them look more shapely			2
i was so flat - chested i was nick - named ‘ the plank ’			2
but now i am thankful for those legs and , at least , i do n’t have droopy boobs			2
at 45 , i see good bone structure and skin that has only a sprinkling of fine lines thanks to rigorous application of suncream			1
my figure has remained the size it was at university thanks to yoga and tennis and a disciplined attitude to food , and i still have a head of thick dark hair , though that i owe to my mother			1
when i look in the mirror , i see a woman who has aged relatively well , in part due to the effort i ’ve put into staying fit and healthy			2
one of the things my chic @entity107 aunt taught me was that taking care of your appearance is good manners and shows respect for those around you , as opposed to something to be ashamed of , which is the usual attitude in @entity117			1
here , the prevailing view is that if you spend time on yourself , you ’re vain and superficial			2
vain and superficial ? possibly			2
because good looks work and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is lying			1
@entity54 ’s argument is that she wants to be treated as a serious actress and not a sex symbol			1
but i do n’t agree with her that beauty and gravitas are mutually exclusive			2
she is a great example of a woman who has achieved both			2
on the whole , you ’re better off being nice - looking than not			2
i think @entity54 is being disingenuous if she says the disadvantages outweigh the advantages			1
@entity20 argues that while @entity54 's good looks will undoubtedly have opened doors for her in the industry , it 's her talent that has kept them open i ca n’t see how good looks are in any way a barrier to a career			1
they ’re rarely a barrier to anything as far as i can tell			2
i probably would n’t have a driving licence if i had n’t worn a mini-skirt to my test			2
yes , you read that correctly			0
i had failed my test five times			0
finally , a friend said he would buy me an intensive driving course , two lessons a day for a week in @entity156 at the end of which i would take my test			0
my test was a disaster			0
i rolled backwards on the hill start and went the wrong way down a one - way street , almost crashing the car in the process			0
at the end , we pulled over and i prepared myself for the usual ‘ i ’m sorry to say miss @entity167 , you have failed			0
’ incredibly the dour @entity169 - man next to me told me i had passed			0
‘ really ? ’ i exclaimed			0
‘ well , ’ he said , glancing at my legs			0
’ for living proof that good looks help your job prospects , you only have to compare the careers of @entity177 ( left ) and @entity178 ( right ) , says @entity20			1
both were very talented football players but only one of them looked good in underwear my husband only hired me because he thought i was pretty			1
we met when he interviewed me for a job on @entity186 magazine			1
i knew less than nothing about trade finance , but i got the job			0
years later , he admitted his hiring policy			0
‘ interviews are such a lottery , ’ he told me			0
‘ so you may as well hire the pretty one			1
’ i am not saying that looks alone will keep you in a job ( i did eventually get fired from that magazine , thank @entity197			1
i was hopeless at it , a stark fact no number of charming smiles could disguise ) but they will present you with opportunities to get in the door , spoken to and remembered			1
i suspect @entity54 might have got her first role in @entity205 in part because she is such a stunner , but they would n’t have cast her again and again if she ’d been useless			1
her looks will undoubtedly have opened doors for her in the industry , but her talent has kept them open			0
my daughters are now 13 and 15			0
i , of course , think they are stunning			0
‘ have you any idea what an advantage you have already , before you ’ve even said or done anything at all ? ’ i keep telling them			0
@entity20 says her figure has remained the size it was at university thanks to yoga and tennis and a disciplined attitude to food , and she still has a head of thick dark hair , though that she owes to my mother it may be unfair and it may not be right , but the truth is that if you walk into a situation as a pretty girl , 9.9 times out of ten , your looks will work in your favour			1
according to a study carried out by the @entity239 , @entity240 , in 2011 , good looks are the single most important factor for a successful career			1
the study found that being beautiful is as important as having a degree			0
beautiful women — and men — will come up against some people ( usually ugly ones ) who discriminate against them because they do n’t want nice - looking people around them			0
but on the whole , if you look good , you ’re going to be more successful in life			1
for living proof that good looks help your job prospects , you only have to compare the careers of @entity177 and @entity178			1
@entity20 says her husband only hired her on his trade magazine because he thought she was pretty both were very talented football players			1
in fact , some say @entity177 was the more talented of the two			0
but only one of them looked good in underwear			1
i predict that @entity177 could wander down the @entity262 ( even in his underwear ) and no one would give him a second glance			0
@entity178 would be mobbed before he took his jacket off			0
@entity269 the @entity268 economist has coined the term the ‘ beauty premium ’ , which means that attractive ceos benefit their companies in various ways			0
for example , the share price rises when they have made a television appearance			0
of course , especially for women , looks can determine what paths our lives take			0
as the writer @entity287 once said : ‘ i honestly believe that if i ’d had bigger breasts my life would have been different			0
’ though it ’s fair to say her achievements as a writer and director hardly make her one of life ’s under - achievers			0
maybe the point @entity54 is trying to get across is that if you look like @entity298 you are unlikely to become a tax inspector			1
or even get to play one in a film			0
some women do rebel against their lot			0
for example , @entity305 , who was once the most beautiful woman in the world , decided to give up on looking after herself and look after donkeys instead			0
and then she ended up looking like one			0
i guess if @entity54 is seriously disgruntled about being too pretty she could follow @entity305 ’s lead and opt out			1
but , somehow , i doubt she will			0
because being beautiful is not something any woman will give up on easily			0
there are too many advantages to be gained			0
@entity315 is the author of the ex-factor ( @entity317 , £ 7.99 ) .			0
