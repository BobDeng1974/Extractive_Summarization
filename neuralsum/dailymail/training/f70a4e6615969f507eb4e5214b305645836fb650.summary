yet gardener @entity0 has still managed to grow @entity5 ’s tallest ever sunflower			1
it appears the plant ’s love of sunshine and hot , tropical conditions has n’t stopped it thriving despite the poor weather - or maybe it was just striving to get a little closer to some elusive sunshine			0
now the giant specimen is agonisingly short of scooping the world record for the tallest sunflower			1
standing 26ft tall , it is currently just four inches off the world record of 26 ft 4in , set by @entity25 @entity24 in 2009			1

he said : ‘ this sunflower has been 30 years in the making			0
for as long as i can remember i ’ve grown a taller one each year			0
it has got to the stage now where i ’ve got this super strain generating giant ones			0
’ mr @entity0 has battled driving rain , overcast skies and early frosts to grow the giant flower - which stands at over two storeys high - on the side of his terraced home			1
and even as winter begins to set in and temperatures fall away , the towering sunflower is still growing			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve not given up hope of it breaking the world record , but with the nights drawing in and the weather changing , the sunflower will begin to shut up shop soon			2
‘ it is frustrating as we are only a day or two of sunshine away from it growing the five inches needed			0
all we can do is hope			0
