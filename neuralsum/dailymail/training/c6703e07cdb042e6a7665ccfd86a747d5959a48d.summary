@entity125 and @entity126 , for the past 24 months i ’ve been thinking about having a crack in the @entity7 , and over the last 12 months i ’ve been seriously considering it			2

i will be withdrawing from the @entity132 side immediately , and accepting a conditional release from the @entity23 to make the move overseas			2

the hardest thing about leaving the club is there ’s stability for the first time in a long time , but i know where my heart lies and i ’m following that			0
