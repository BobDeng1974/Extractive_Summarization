mobile operator @entity0 has switched on the world 's fastest 4g network in @entity3 today , capable of reaching speeds of up to @entity5			1
the technology is being trialled in @entity3 before being rolled out further next year and is ten times faster than basic 4g speeds currently being offered			1
the company has faced stiff competition recently from @entity10 and @entity11 after the rival operators switched on their respective 4g services - a stronghold @entity0 held for almost a year			2
@entity0 's new network has launched in @entity3 and can reach speeds of @entity5 - its basic 4g speeds currently range from 24 to @entity17			1
further expansion plans have not been announced but @entity0 said the technology is due to become ' commercially available when compatible devices launch from mid- 2014 ' the new speeds , in theory , mean blu - ray and high - definition videos can be downloaded in seconds and wo n’t buffer during playback			1
webpages should also load instantly			0
the technology will make streaming content online , such as on the @entity30 , up to four times faster than current speeds and users will be able to share higher - resolution , larger pictures and videos quicker			1
@entity0 was the first operator to launch a 4g network in the @entity38 in october 2012 , followed by @entity10 and @entity11 earlier this year			2
@entity0 ’s basic @entity40 speeds range between 24 and @entity41			1
following the 4g announcements from @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity0 said it would be offering double speeds to its customers in certain areas - raising its top speed to @entity47			2
the latest network peaks at @entity5 and runs on @entity51 technology through the world ’s first @entity52 @entity55 router			1
the router can offer superfast speeds to up to twenty phones , tablets and other devices			2
@entity0 , which was formed from the merger of @entity62 and @entity62 , was the first company to offer a 4g network in the @entity38			2
@entity0 held the monopoly on the network because regulator @entity66 gave it permission to use existing spectrum ( @entity69 ) that it already owned			2
@entity66 then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the spectrum from @entity73 to @entity74			0
@entity10 purchased @entity76 lots and @entity11 won both @entity76 and @entity74 lots			0
for the typical user , download speeds of initial 4g networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks			0
in july , @entity0 announced it was doubling its 4g speeds for people in @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity3 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
the speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4g speeds and 10 times as fast as @entity101			2
@entity11 and @entity10 both switched on their respective networks at the end of august			0
@entity105 has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new 4g service by announcing it will offer the super high - speed internet at no extra cost			0
the firm ’s 1.5million customers will get @entity40 at the same price they pay for the current @entity101 , with packages of calls , texts and unlimited internet from £ 15 a month			0
the @entity118 deal will start mid-december , cashing in on @entity120 handset sales			0
as with all mobile and broadband contracts , these speeds are called ‘ optimal ’ and come with the caveat of ‘ up to ’			0
the speeds shown are the greatest possible speeds available on that network , but realistically customers wo n't be able to reach these			2
what it does mean is that even if customers are getting a proportional speed boost on a network such as the one launched by @entity0 today , the boost will still be higher than on other networks			1
the @entity137 network covers @entity138 from launch , but @entity0 said it will be rolled out across @entity3 throughout 2014			1
further expansion plans have not been announced but @entity0 said the technology is due to become ‘ commercially available when compatible devices launch from mid- 2014			1
’ the latest @entity0 network peaks at @entity5 and runs on @entity51 technology through the world 's first @entity52 @entity55 router			1
@entity0 recently celebrated it first birthday			0
the network has over 1.2million 4g customers and covers 131 towns and cities - approximately 60 per cent of the population it is expected the first @entity158 mobile @entity156 units will launch by the summer 2014 , for example , with handsets featuring the technology due by the fourth quarter			1
@entity0 ceo @entity62 said : ' our existing 4g network delivers incredible mobile data speeds and covers millions of people across the country , but we never stand still			1
' our analysts predict that data usage will grow significantly over the next three years			0
in fact , our trend - mapping shows that data usage is set to rise by 750 per cent in that period , as consumers and companies conduct more of their business and lives on - line			0
' the network we ’re switching on in @entity138 uses the spectrum we acquired in the @entity66 spectrum auction earlier this year , and is the first part of an infrastructure that can meet the future demands of an increasingly data - hungry nation , enabling us to stay one - step ahead of the demand			0

@entity0 's basic @entity40 network speeds range between 24 and @entity17
the new network , launched in @entity3 , can reach speeds of @entity5
this means @entity202 videos , for example , could be downloaded in seconds
@entity0 's network runs on the world 's first @entity52 router made by @entity55
the technology is expected to roll out to handsets by the end of 2014
