these implausible towers of irregularly shaped stones seem as if they should tumble as soon as you look at them			1
rising in the picturesque wilderness they could almost be the work of fairies , mischievously placed to confuse passers - by who chance upon them			2
artist @entity11 , 43 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , does not use any adhesives to stick together the rocks			1
instead , he carefully calculates how best to balance his stones in the most surprising ways			1
the amateur photographer insists the practice helps him to meditate and feel closer to nature			0
' it is all about the connection between water , rocks and me , ' he says			0
' i just pick some random rocks and one unusual stone for the top of the installation and the process can begin			0
' mathematically , i have to find three points on each stone so it can stand still			0
but this is much more than just mathematics - it is a way of meditating and connecting with nature			2
when the connection is right the magic happens , gravity surrenders and the whole place becomes balanced and peaceful			0
