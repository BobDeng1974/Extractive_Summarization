a @entity2 police officer 's full account of why he shot dead unarmed teen @entity3 has been revealed for the first time - and he describes a frantic struggle inside his police car during which @entity3 grabbed his gun , twisted it around and pointed it at him - making him fear for his life			1
@entity9 's testimony runs contrary to most eye - witness accounts and significantly makes the claim that @entity3 , 18 , charged him after the initial struggle and never raised his arms in surrender			1
@entity9 , 28 , paints a picture of an officer in distress during the afternoon of august 8 as a belligerent @entity3 , who was 6 - foot - 4 and nearly 300lb , tried to steal his sidearm and turn the weapon against him			1
further compounding @entity9 's version of events was the revelation that @entity3 had marijuana in his system when he was shot			1
the police also say @entity3 had marijuana on him at the time of his fatal run - in with officer @entity9			1
it comes after partial elements of @entity9 ' version of events were leaked last week and the same day that the former head of the @entity52 said he believed @entity9 would most likely not be indicted by a @entity2 state grand jury			1
the police officer ’s dramatic account of events depicts a life - or - death struggle inside his squad car with the ' incredibly strong ' teen – after @entity3 allegedly punched him in the face and reached for his gun			1
and , significantly , @entity9 claims he shot @entity3 dead as the teen charged at him on the street – after the alleged attacker apparently retreated after he was shot in the hand during the struggle in the car			1
a grand jury decision on whether @entity9 should be indicted on criminal charges is expected within weeks			1
a separate leaked autopsy report also appears to show @entity3 had marijuana in his system when he was shot			1
the account , based on statements @entity9 made after the encounter , was conveyed to the @entity39 by a source familiar with the documents			0
other witnesses have dismissed @entity9 's version of events , and the @entity3 family 's lawyer said ' the story does n't even make good nonsense '			1
in the account , @entity9 told how he was driving down @entity86 after dealing with a call about a sick baby when he spotted @entity3 and his friend @entity89 walking down the @entity90			2
he said he told them to get onto the sidewalk , and was met with abuse from the pair			0
the statement said @entity9 then noticed that they were carrying cigarillos , and that @entity89 looked like a man described in recent radio alerts as a suspect in a convenience store theft in which ' blunts ' were taken			0
the police officer then said he parked his @entity105 suv , and called for assistance			0
but , he claims , as he tried to get out he was met with a punch in the face from @entity3 , who allegedly struck through the car 's open window			1
immediate response : in this image investigators crowd round @entity3 's body immediately after the shooting @entity9 said he had no choice but to draw his pistol when faced with the ' incredibly strong ' teen			2
@entity3 was 6 - foot - 4 and nearly 300lb at the time of his death			0
@entity9 said he could n't use his pepper spray in the close quarters because it would have hit him too			0
his baton was out of reach at the back of his belt			0
in the statement @entity9 told how @entity3 grabbed at the pistol and continued to hit him in the face			2
the officer , who said he almost passed out in the attack , then told how he felt @entity3 , whose strength he found remarkable , twisting the barrel towards his own body			0
at one point , the muzzle of the gun was pointed at @entity9 's own hip			1
@entity9 went on to describe how he jerked back inside the car , loosening @entity3 's grip on the gun enough for him to squeeze the trigger			1
vigils : demonstrators - pictured on october 20 - have continually held vigils for @entity3 since the shooting in august			0
they are pictured above on @entity147 , where he died protests : thousands have taken to the streets of @entity44 in outrage over the incident but , he said , the first time nothing happened - because @entity3 had his finger in the gun 's hammer , which stopped it from firing			1
separate accounts of the events which have been made public have also claimed there was a scuffle of some sort inside the police car - citing blood and skin samples picked up in investigations			2
when @entity9 pulled the trigger again , the pistol went off , hitting @entity3 's hand and sending glass cascading around the car			1
evidence presented by the @entity39 from the autopsy report also seems to support a close - range impact			2
the document told how the entry wound in @entity3 's hand had no ' stippling ' - a feature of mid-range impacts - suggesting a point - blank release			2
in his account , @entity9 then described firing a second shot - which missed			0
response : police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations @entity9 said he was left unable to radio for backup because his transponder had been knocked away from the right setting in the chaos			0
so , on his own , @entity9 said he got out of the car and gave chase			0
it was at that point when @entity3 turned			0
@entity9 said @entity3 then ' charged ' at him and would n't stop when he yelled			2
he started firing , and hit four times			0
one shot , @entity9 said , hit @entity3 's forehead and brought him down			2
he also denied - as many witnesses have claimed - that @entity3 had his hands up in a gesture of surrender			0
@entity9 's extensive account is at odds with several others which have emerged in the wake of the killing , which has sparked widespread and ongoing protests in the @entity2 town			2
others have said @entity3 was fleeing , or had unambiguously surrendered			0
it has also been suggested that @entity9 himself was more aggressive toward @entity3 than suggested in the latest account .			0
