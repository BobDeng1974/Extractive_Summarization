by @entity0 published : 12:38 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 10 january 2013 unleashing the free market : influential lobbyist @entity2 has suggested that future @entity4 missions could be sponsored by private companies the next rover built to explore the surface of @entity9 could be plastered with branding by companies more associated with @entity12 , an influential lobbyist has suggested			1
@entity2 , a former congressman who now lobbies for @entity13 , outlined the audacious plan in testimony to @entity16			2
he said @entity4 should seek out sponsorship from private firms to help fund its missions , much in the same way that motor racing teams festoon their cars with the branding of corporate backers			1
' the sponsorships there pay for operations costing $ 200 - $ 300 million a year			0
that 's enough for a whole space flight , ' @entity28 walker told the @entity31			2
he added : ' when the @entity34 rover is traversing @entity9 terrain , we will be more solidly on our way to fulfilling our destiny in the stars			0
' in his testimony to @entity16 last month , mr @entity2 , a @entity39 who chaired the @entity41 from 1995 to 1997 , said @entity4 must behave like an entrepreneur to continue to succeed in the realm of space exploration			1
the scheme is similar to the way in which sports stadia sell naming rights to large corporations - for example @entity52 play at the @entity53 , named for the @entity55 based airline			0
in the same way , companies would bid to have their names and logos put on various @entity4 space vehicles , like @entity9 rovers , the future @entity63 and even , if partners agree , the @entity64			2
' would anything in science , aeronautics of exploration be harmed if names were attached to the particular missions and they were sponsored ? ' mr @entity2 asked			0
' i ca n't imagine why			0
' these sponsorship dollars could be structured to remain outside the appropriations process , increasing the amounts of money available to @entity4 and , at the same time , avoiding to some extent the annual appropriations cycle			1

former congressman *claims* sponsorship could raise enough to fund entire space missions
he calls for @entity4 to behave more like an entrepreneur to avoid the *uncertainty* of annual procurement *decisions*
