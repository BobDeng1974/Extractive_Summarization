by @entity0 a car enthusiast from @entity2 has been reunited with his dream @entity3 more than thirty years after it was stolen			2
the last time @entity6 saw his ' 79 @entity3 was in 1981 as it was parked on @entity7 , @entity2 , before thieves made off with it			0
but authorities have tracked it down to @entity12 after noticing a suspect @entity14 number on the chassis , and it is now waiting at a police station in @entity17			2
when @entity6 last saw his beloved @entity3 ( pictured ) it was parked in @entity2 in 1981 before thieves made off with it @entity6 filed a police report at the time , but thought the car was gone until last week when he got a call to say officers in @entity12 had tracked it down @entity6 told @entity24 : ' i was sitting at home last friday looking at @entity27 , and i get a call from @entity29 telling me you have a @entity3 in @entity12 , come and get it			1
and i said , " what ? ” ' @entity6 told reporters that he always liked corvettes as they were attractive cars and popular with the ladies			0
when the car stolen 33 years ago , he filed police report , but after officers found no trace of the vehicle he decided to forget about it			1
now officers in @entity12 say the car still in working order , has only 47,000 miles on the clock , and are asking @entity6 to come and collect it			1
speaking about the moment the car was found , @entity6 's friend @entity46 said : ' it was just exciting , i felt like i was part of finding the car			0
despite some cosmetic damage , mr @entity6 's @entity3 is running and has just 47,000 miles on the clock now @entity6 is considering whether to have the car shipped to him , or whether to drive it home corvettes registered in 1979 are considered by many to be classic @entity56 cars , and can fetch up to $ 6,000 ( £ 3,500 ) in good condition with around 50,000 miles			1
while images appear to show @entity6 's car has suffered since he last saw it , with rusted bodywork and peeling seats , it could be worth a similar amount once repaired			0
