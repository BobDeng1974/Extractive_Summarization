it is one of the worst moments in history , which still horrifies to this day			2
during @entity6 's brutal reign of @entity7 , more than six million @entity4 were killed			1
but now new research has discovered that the holocaust may well be even worse than previously thought			2
thirteen years ago , researchers at the @entity11 began the task of documenting all the ghettos , slave labour sites , concentration camps and killing factories that the @entity17 set up throughout @entity18 - and realised they had underestimated the extent of the @entity17 ' evil			1
this map shows the vast spread of @entity24 concentration camps across @entity18 the map shows the @entity7 ghettos and camps throughout @entity18 , spanning @entity29 - controlled areas from @entity30 to @entity31 and @entity7 itself , during @entity6 's reign of brutality from 1933 to 1945 researchers at the @entity11 have been documenting all of the @entity7 concentration camps , ghettos , slave labour sites and killing factories which had been set up across @entity18			1
when they first started the project , the team expected to find about 7,000 camps and ghettos			2
shockingly , they discovered 42,500 camps across large swathes of @entity29 - controlled @entity18			1
the researchers predict that up to 20 million people died or were imprisoned in the sites			1
speaking to the @entity50 , @entity48 , director of the institute , said : ' the numbers are so much higher than what we originally thought			2
this image shows the main gate of the @entity7 concentration camp @entity57 , with the sign above the gate reading : hard work will set you free horrific : the figures are much higher than previously thought - researchers first thought that about 7,000 @entity7 camps existed awful : @entity4 men are pictured being transported from the @entity66 by @entity68 soldiers to work on sites elsewhere when the project began , researchers thought they would find about 7,000 @entity7 camps , only to find more than 40,000			1
30,000 slave labour camps 1,150 @entity4 ghettos 980 concentration camps 1,000 prisoner - of - war camps 500 brothels filled with sex slaves ' we knew before how horrible life in the camps and ghettos was but the numbers are unbelievable			0
' the figure includes 30,000 slave labour camps and 980 concentration camps			0
as well as ' killing centres ' they included forced labour camps where prisoners made supplies for the war			0
they also included sites called ' care ' centres in which pregnant women were made to have abortions or their babies murdered shortly after birth			1
the researchers have created a series of maps which present a grim view of life in wartime @entity103 show just how widespread the camps were , although most were centred in @entity7 and @entity105			0
previous data has shown just the existence of individual camps on a fragmented basis			0
but using data from 400 contributors , they have now documented the large scale operation for the first time			0
they have discovered exactly where they are located and how they were run			0
it is now believed that the research could help survivors with their claims over unpaid insurance policies			0
researchers say the project has helped change the understanding about @entity128 experts over how the camps were run			0
the @entity66 has been identified as the biggest site - holding about 500,000 people at one point			1
when the project first started , the researchers expected to find about 7,000 @entity7 camps and ghettos			0
but as the project has gone on , the numbers constantly increased to the current figure of 42,500 .			1

but they were left horrified to discover 42,500 across much of @entity18
they also estimate up to 20 million people died or were imprisoned at sites
