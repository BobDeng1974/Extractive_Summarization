by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 19:29 est , 8 october 2013 the @entity1 yesterday doubled @entity3 ’s growth forecasts for the year in the biggest upgrade for any major economy			1
in a huge boost for the government , the @entity1 said @entity3 output will increase by 1.4 per cent this year – twice the rate predicted in april when it warned chancellor @entity10 was ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with his austerity programme			1
the forecast was also higher than the 0.9 per cent predicted in july and the @entity1 expects growth to accelerate to 1.9 per cent in 2014			1
boost : @entity10 will feel vindicated at the @entity1 upgrading its forecast for @entity3 growth by more than any other developed economy its chief economist @entity19 , who was behind the ‘ playing with fire ’ claim , conceded that he was ‘ pleasantly surprised ’			1
@entity3 ’s economy is now the fastest growing among the @entity25 members of the @entity27 group of the world ’s richest nations , including @entity30 and @entity31			2
@entity31 will grow by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent next year , and @entity30 by just 0.2 per cent in 2013 and one per cent in 2014			1
mr @entity19 said : ‘ six months ago we were worried about growth in the @entity3 coming back			1
we ’ve been pleasantly surprised			0
’ but in a note of scepticism , he said @entity3 ’s improved performance ‘ does not tell us whether fiscal consolidation [ austerity ] was right or not ’			2
‘ it does n’t tell us whether growth would have come back earlier with a different fiscal framework			0
when we see risks , we warn			0
and if the risks are avoided , all the better , ’ he said			0
in its @entity43 report , the @entity1 noted signs of an improving economy consistent ‘ with increasing consumer and business confidence ’			2
however , it said ‘ output remains well below its pre- crisis peak ’			0
recent figures suggest @entity3 ’s gross domestic product is still about 3 per cent shy of the peak in 2007			2
meanwhile a poll of members of the @entity55 found 75 per cent believe the outlook is now ‘ brighter ’ than at any time since 2008			0
the improved outlook will , however , take some time to be reflected in the jobs market			0
the @entity1 says the unemployment rate will fall from 7.7 per cent this year to 7.5 per cent in 2014			1
this measure is important because the @entity61 will not consider raising interest rates until it falls to 7 per cent			0
the main cloud on the horizon for the @entity3 and world economy is the ‘ shutdown ’ in @entity68 , the @entity1 ’s chief economist said , while failure to lift the @entity71 debt ceiling could lead to ‘ potentially major disruptions ’ in financial markets			1
the @entity74 said : ‘ the @entity1 has confirmed the @entity3 economy is turning a corner			1
’ but it acknowledged ‘ the recovery can not be taken for granted ’			0
mr @entity10 said : ‘ i think the overwhelming majority of people now realise @entity3 was right to tackle its debts			2
we can see jobs being created in our economy , but , of course , we ’ve still got a long way to go			0
’ reverse : only six months ago the @entity1 's chief economist @entity19 accused mr @entity10 of ' playing with fire '			1

@entity1 boosts @entity3 by more than any developed nation
@entity3 to grow by 1.4 ****%**** this year and 1.9 ****%**** in 2014 , up from 0.9 ****%**** and *1.5* ****%****
in april @entity1 's @entity19 called for *coalition* to change course
