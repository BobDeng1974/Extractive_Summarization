researchers have unveiled a new pill that could replace injections			2
it can deliver drugs that can not currently be delivered as a pill			0
however , there is one caveat - the pill is covered in tiny needles			2
when the pill reaches the desired location in the digestive tract , the @entity13 - sensitive coating surrounding the capsule dissolves , allowing the drug to be released			1
the microneedle pill is coated with hollow needles			1
when the pill reaches the desired location in the digestive tract , the @entity13 - sensitive coating surrounding the capsule dissolves , allowing the drug to be released			1
their prototype acrylic capsule , 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter , includes a reservoir for the drug and is coated with hollow , stainless steel needles about 5 millimeters long			1
because there are no pain receptors in the @entity33 tract , patients would not feel any pain from the drug injection			1
researchers at @entity37 and @entity38 ( @entity38 ) have devised a novel drug capsule coated with tiny needles that can inject drugs directly into the lining of the stomach after the capsule is swallowed			1
in animal studies , the team found that the capsule delivered insulin more efficiently than injection under the skin , and there were no harmful side effects as the capsule passed through the digestive system			0
' this could be a way that the patient can circumvent the need to have an infusion or subcutaneous administration of a drug , ' says @entity62 , who led the research , which appears in the @entity65			0
although the researchers tested their capsule with insulin , they anticipate that it would be most useful for delivering biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies , which are used to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders like arthritis and crohn 's disease			0
this class of drugs , known as ' biologics , ' also includes vaccines , recombinant dna , and @entity81			0
' the large size of these biologic drugs makes them nonabsorbable			0
and before they even would be absorbed , they 're degraded in your @entity33 tract by acids and enzymes that just eat up the molecules and make them inactive , ' says @entity93 , a graduate student in chemical engineering and a lead author of the paper			1
scientists have tried designing microparticles and nanoparticles that can deliver drugs , but such particles are expensive to produce and require a new version to be engineered for each drug			0
when the pill has reached the desired location in the @entity33 tract , the coating dissolves , revealing the microneedles			1
in the case of hollow microneedles ( top right ) , the drug reservoir is compressed through peristalsis , releasing the drug through the needles			1
in the case of solid microneedles ( bottom right ) , the drug is formulated into the microneedles			0
the microneedles lodge in the tissue where they can slowly dissolve and release their payload			0
the @entity37 prototype acrylic capsule , 2 centimeters long and 1 centimeter in diameter , includes a reservoir for the drug and is coated with hollow , stainless steel needles about 5 millimeters long			1
previous studies of accidental ingestion of sharp objects in human patients have suggested that it could be safe to swallow a capsule coated with short needles			2
because there are no pain receptors in the @entity33 tract , patients would not feel any pain from the drug injection			1
to test whether this type of capsule could allow safe and effective drug delivery , the researchers tested it in pigs , with insulin as the drug payload			0
it took more than a week for the capsules to move through the entire digestive tract , and the researchers found no traces of tissue damage , supporting the potential safety of this novel approach			0
this approach could also be used to administer vaccines that normally have to be injected , the researchers say			0
the team now plans to modify the capsule so that peristalsis , or contractions of the digestive tract , would slowly squeeze the drug out of the capsule as it travels through the tract			2
they are also working on capsules with needles made of degradable polymers and sugar that would break off and become embedded in the gut lining , where they would slowly disintegrate and release the drug .			2
