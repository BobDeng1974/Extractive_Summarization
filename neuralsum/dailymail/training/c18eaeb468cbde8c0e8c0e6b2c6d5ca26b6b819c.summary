by @entity0 it 's a feeling every @entity3 footballer knows - you watch a @entity6 game and think ' i 'm better than some of those players '			1
well now amateurs in the third tier of the @entity11 have the chance to prove it , as they go up against former @entity11 and @entity15 midfielder @entity14			1
@entity14 , 33 , made his debut last weekend for @entity17 , scoring in a 2 - 2 draw against @entity19			1

' playing professionally is not something you forget in one day			0
' the lads asked me a couple of years ago if i would play for them when i retired and i always said i would			2

' playing is great for me , it gets me out of the house			0
and i also enjoy a couple of drinks with the lads after the match			0
