the @entity2 government drew up plans to whisk @entity4 out of @entity5 and allow him to live out his days in another @entity7 country , it was reported last night			1
the @entity9 plan would have placed the dictator ‘ in retirement ’ and out of the reach of international law in oil - rich @entity14			1
it was regarded as an option for ending the devastation and loss of life during the rebel uprising and subsequent international assault by @entity23 forces including @entity2 in 2011			1
history : former @entity2 prime minister @entity26 meeting @entity4 back in 2007 - it has been revealed that @entity2 planned to take @entity4 out of @entity5 flying in : then development secretary @entity28 had visited @entity5 to discuss options for @entity4 during the fighting , @entity28 , the then international development secretary , went to the notoriously corrupt @entity7 country to build contacts with the regime , it was reported			1
when contacted by the mail last night mr @entity28 declined to comment			1
however it is known that he attended an @entity39 meeting in @entity14 on behalf of the government to drum up support for its policy on intervention in @entity5			2
the conference took place in june 2011 in the capital , @entity47			0
asked last night about the report , an intelligence source conceded he was ‘ not unfamiliar ’ with the suggestion of such a plan			0
the belief at the time was that it was an option that @entity14 might have been prepared to accept			2
members of @entity4 ’s immediate family , including his second wife and three children , fled to @entity58 during the conflict carrying some of the regime ’s vast wealth in gold bars			1
bad memories : the sky filled with billowing smoke was a constant visual during the @entity5 troubles of 2011 horror : one of the burnt out buildings of @entity70 street brings back harsh memories of the @entity5 troubles as the conflict ended , @entity4 disappeared only to be killed in october 2011 as he tried to flee to neighbouring @entity74			1
the details of the @entity4 exit strategy are disclosed in ‘ in it together ’ by @entity77 about the @entity78			2
the book is being serialised by the @entity81			0
he writes that the plan was drawn up during the bombing campaign by @entity85 , @entity2 , @entity86 and other forces in the aftermath of the @entity89			2
@entity2 officials considered whether he could remain in @entity5 but this was ruled out because it would face opposition from rebels on the @entity95			2
he writes : ‘ there were signs that the @entity4 might accept some form of internal exile - as long as he were allowed an adequate protection force to ensure his security			0
’ ‘ not surprisingly , this was dismissed as impractical			0
’ the @entity108 and @entity9 then ‘ prepared an exit strategy for @entity4 in case it was necessary to strike a deal and to end the conflict			0
’ all over : video footage showed the final few moments in the life of @entity4 @entity14 ‘ was chosen as a prospective retirement home ’			1
mr @entity28 , the book claims , ‘ was able to assist the officials tasked with these delicate contingency plans , helping make the necessary contacts in the capital , @entity47 , and elsewhere ’			1
the 50 - car convoy carrying @entity4 and his retinue was bombed by @entity86 fighter planes and then cornered by rebel fighters			0
the dictator was tortured and killed			0
it has been claimed that he was under escort from a group of @entity127 mercenaries at the time , and that the escape attempt had the tacit support of @entity131 countries			0
@entity5 at war : the uprising against @entity4 ended up involving @entity23 - and it has now been revealed @entity2 planned to whisk the dictator to a ' safe haven ' victory : rebels waged a determined fight against the @entity5 leader , and ended up getting what they wanted @entity14 was the subject of an attempted coup in 2004 led by the old @entity144 @entity143			1
the so - called ‘ @entity149 ’ was disrupted when a group of mercenaries was arrested in @entity147 prior to entering the country			0
had @entity4 made it to @entity14 , international prosecutors would have been unable to put him on trial for the abuses against his people during his 42 - year reign			1
placing dictators in ‘ retirement ’ is not without precedent			0
@entity159 , the @entity160 dictator , fled his country in 1979 and lived out the rest of his life in @entity164			0

@entity28 began to ' build contacts ' with the regime
