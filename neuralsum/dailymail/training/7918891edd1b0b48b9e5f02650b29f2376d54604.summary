for more than a decade of his life , @entity0 had doctors baffled over what was causing his incessant sleepiness			1
convinced his tiredness was in his head , due to laziness or simply an imbalance in his vitamin levels , the now 28 - year - old has spent the last 15 years battling multiple alarm clocks in an effort just to drag himself out of bed in the morning			2
three years ago after years of doctor 's visits , misdiagnoses and an emotional battle coming to terms with his struggles , @entity0 was diagnosed with ' idiopathic hypersomnia ' , an incredibly rare sleep disorder			1
@entity0 , 28 , has a rare condition called idiopathic hypersomnia for more than a decade of his life doctors were baffled by his mystery illness which was causing him to sleep all the time a drug called @entity27 allows him to function normally for six weeks at a time , but forces him to go without for the following two months ' it ’s when you sleep more than 10 hours a day on a regular basis and they 've ruled out all the other causes like narcolepsy and drug addiction , ' @entity0 told @entity36			1
' during the day you ’re what they call sleep drunk , you ’re living in a fog			1
' when you ’re living it , you do n’t realise how much it takes just to be a normal human being			0
' i ’m there , the lights are on but nobody ’s home , ' he revealed			0
growing up in the suburbs of @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity0 always had issues with one of his hips , problems so severe it saw him undergo a number of hip surgeries before he even reached his early teens			2
' as a teenager we always thought my problem was related to my hip problems ... we always thought it was pain related problem not a sleep - related problem , ' the 28 - year - old revealed			2
' when i got really bad when i was about 25 i went back i realised when i looked back i had so many symptoms that were consistent with hypersomnia , ' @entity0 added			1
@entity0 - once he made a miraculous recovery in his early teens - was once an active young man with a passion for exercise , who spent his time training for and competing in triathlons			1
his high - flying and high - demand job as a trainer of hypnotherapy took him across time zones and around the world and while he spent any spare moment he had sleeping , he convinced himself it was his demanding lifestyle that was causing his insatiable appetite for sleep			2
growing up in the suburbs of @entity51 in @entity52 , @entity0 always had issues with one of his hips , problems so severe it saw him undergo a number of his surgeries before he even reached his early teens @entity0 - once he made a miraculous recovery in his early teens - was once an active young man with a passion for exercise , who spent his time training and competing in triathlons but a motorbike accident when he was in @entity97 in @entity98 was a ' wake - up call ' ' a lot of it i just sort of blamed myself , i thought oh i must be eating too many carbs , i must have some sort of vitamin or mineral deficiency , ' @entity0 continued			1
' when i was not well and no one could figure out what was going on there was a lot of unhappiness and despair			0
' when he was particularly flat after months on end of travelling , @entity0 's mother suggested he take an extended holiday after he was diagnosed with glandular fever in 2012			1
as a big believer in the power of the mind and natural remedies he spent six months in @entity97 in northern @entity98 accessing age - old treatments , but nothing worked			0
a motorbike accident served as a ' wake - up call ' for @entity0 and he headed back home to @entity52 to try @entity52 treatments			2
' if i had any idea my brain was as impaired as it is i never would have been driving , ' he said			0
having tried everything from amphetamines to ritalin - commonly used in the treatment of @entity132 , and being diagnosed with a plethora of things from glandular fever and chronic fatigue to depression it was a relief when @entity0 was finally told he had idiopathic hypersomnia			1
but hope faded quickly when he discovered how little anyone knew about the condition , and the lack of available treatments			0
' there was depression on a whole another level when i realised i had something but no treatments were working , ' @entity0 said @entity0 said among the things he misses most is being able to jump on his bike and go for a ride he believes the condition first appeared when he was younger and if diagnosed earlier would be less severe however a few years ago there was light at the end of the tunnel when a very rare and phenomenally expensive drug he had heard about was available close to home			1
' i do n’t want to spend the rest of my life in bed			0
' however a few years ago there was light at the end of the tunnel when a very rare and phenomenally expensive drug he had heard about was available close to home			0
' the drug is really expensive and it supposed to be super rare and used for people coming off sleeping pill addictions , ' @entity0 said			1
' i found next to nothing online , but i found this clinic in @entity173 which is like ten minutes from my house where it was available			0
' i called and said ‘ i ’m not a drug addict but			0
. " ' @entity0 laughed			2
after speaking to a researcher and receiving a call from the doctors who were fascinated by his rare condition @entity0 tried a drug called @entity27			1
when he received his first dose , @entity0 was at a very low point			2
but the immediate impact the drug had on his wellbeing was undeniable			0
' i had this huge grin on my face and it ’s like this fog was gone , ' he recalled			0
at that point i was so depressed			0
i ’d tried all of the anti-depressants and then went on to trying mood stabilisers			0
' within a week of being on the drug his moods had improved , his sleep was regular and he felt ' normal ' again			0
the 28 - year - old remembers being incredibly tired very often from a very young age @entity0 was once an active young man with a passion for exercise , who spent his time training for and competing in triathlons through his battle with idiocratic hypersomnia @entity0 created @entity207 , a community for people who suffer from the condition but the catch is the drug is only effective for six weeks at a time , at which point @entity0 has to have two months off the medication to reset his system			1
‘ the @entity27 is like night and day for me , ' he said			1
through his battle with idiocratic hypersomnia @entity0 created a website with his skills acquired during his computer science degree			1
living with @entity207 is a community for people suffering from the condition , with around 2000 members worldwide , some of which are doctors and researchers			1
' when i was learning about it , there was n't even a wikipedia page , ' @entity0 revealed			2
' there 's a doctor in the group who actually wrote the page			0
' he hopes that through this forum and also his @entity236 page , he can help others who are battling the condition , or may not have even been diagnosed yet			1
' what i 'm really hoping is there 's going to be people reading this who will go to their doctors and ask questions			0
his high - flying and high - demand job as a trainer of hypnotherapy took him across time zones and around the world wearing him out now his involvement with the hypersomnia community helps he and all those involved keep positive and share any new information ' sleepiness is n't just laziness , and there are lots of treatments that are available			1
' when he is at his best , @entity0 manages an average of nine hours sleep a day and tried to do as much as he can with his time			1
' when i ’m medicated i do as much as i can , i really love my photography and i do a bit of website stuff			0
' i ’ve still be clinging to this idea that i ’ll be able to get to “ normal ” , ' he continued			0
‘ it ’s like i 've lost the ability to trust in my own ability ’			0
but there is hope that through the right balance of @entity27 paired with another medication might be able to give him the right balance			2
' the doctors in @entity51 are working with me to try and find a medicine that will help in those two months and we 've tried a couple of tablets and some of those have showed promise , ' @entity0 said			1
' i ’m just really grateful for a ll the people out there ' he said of his living with @entity207 community			2
' i know what ’s wrong with me now but there ’s a lot of people out there who do n’t			0
' there ’s treatments that help , there 's people who get on those and they work , ' he said			0
