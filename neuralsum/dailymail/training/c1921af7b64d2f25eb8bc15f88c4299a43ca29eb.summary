@entity2 should accept it is too bad at football to compete and join a @entity6 team instead , a @entity1 mp has said			1
@entity7 has called for a debate in the @entity9 on scrapping the @entity2 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 football teams in a bid to do better at the @entity15			1
in the wake of @entity2 's first - round failure at the @entity15 in @entity20 the @entity17 mp said the football authorities from each nation should ' come together ' to form one national team for the @entity6			1
@entity2 's sole victory in 1966 shows the need to join up with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , claims @entity1 mp @entity7 speaking outside the @entity26 , mr @entity7 said : ' it 's my opinion we should have gone down that road a long time ago			1
' none of us have really been successful - @entity2 have not done any good since 1966 and some great players from @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity12 have not played in the @entity15 , such as @entity34 and @entity35			1
' that talent was lost on the international stage			0
' mr @entity7 said he did not believe much could be done about the number of foreign players in the @entity40 in @entity2 , as he said the nation should not ' deny ourselves the option to pick players from @entity13 , @entity11 and @entity12 ' to produce stronger sides			1
he went on : ' even in 1966 we could have had an even stronger side			0
' in the past we would have been world - beaters - throughout the 1970s @entity2 failed to qualify twice and @entity11 did qualify but failed to do any good			2
@entity2 's best performance since 1966 was reaching the semi final in 1990			0
' what 's the point of four teams ? i do n't think any other country puts more than one team out - the @entity55 does n't put forward 50 teams			0
' mr @entity7 added : ' when @entity2 get to the group stage and we can not get out of it , i do n't think we should accept that			2
i think we should try and improve			0
' @entity61 's @entity2 side beat @entity62 4 - 2 at @entity63 to conquer the world but have since endured 48 years of hurt , culminating with the @entity66 securing a solitary point in @entity20 and finishing bottom of their group behind @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
@entity12 last appeared at the @entity15 finals in 1958 - the last occasion when all four home nations played at the same tournament - while @entity13 last took part in 1986 and @entity11 in 1998			1
a @entity79 football team appeared at the @entity80 although only consisted of @entity2 and @entity12 players			2
the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity82 were opposed to a combined team entering in 2012 despite assurances from @entity85 that it would not affect their independence as footballing nations			0
mr @entity7 put forward the idea for the @entity6 team in an early day motion before @entity91			2
he says that ' no other nation fields more than one national team ' and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to ' come together and form one national football team covering the @entity6 '			0
an @entity98 is a formal motion submitted for debate in the @entity26 although very few are actually debated			0
mr @entity7 's @entity98 states in full : ' that this @entity26 notes with regret @entity2 's early exit from the @entity104 ; recalls that @entity2 has not won the @entity15 since 1966 ; further notes that on three occasions since 1966 @entity2 has failed to qualify for the @entity15 at all , that @entity11 has only qualified for eight @entity15 out of a total of 20 , that @entity13 has only qualified for three and @entity12 has only qualified for one in 1958 ; believes that fielding four teams from the @entity6 reduces the chances of success and has denied @entity15 opportunities to outstanding @entity6 players ; observes that no other nation fields more than one national team ; and calls on the football authorities in each of the home countries to come together and form one national football team covering the @entity6			1

@entity7 calls for a @entity9 debate on setting up a @entity6 team
says @entity2 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are not good enough
comes after @entity2 *limped* out of the @entity15 in the group stages
