by @entity0 and @entity1 it is perhaps fitting that these prisons - which @entity5 convicts would once have called home - have themselves been abandoned and left to rot			1
the images , taken by @entity5 photographer @entity8 , show two deserted institutions : old @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 in @entity14			1
the 35 - year - old has captured the sense of despair that so many of the lags incarcerated behind the walls of the two jails would almost certainly have felt			1
it is as if the prisons themselves have been sentenced to a lifetime of rust			1
a 1922 expose by the @entity43 branded it ' the worst prison in the @entity5			1
built in 1896 , prisoners were often kept in solitary confinement and only allowed 20 minutes of exercise each day			1
according to website @entity50 , the prison was exposed for the ' bake - oven murders ' in 1938			1
guards were found to have been putting prisoners into a small building fitted with steam radiators , where they would turn up the heat to full blast			1
inmates called it the ' @entity61 '			1
four prisoners died one hot august weekend , after temperatures inside reached almost 200 degrees			1
an investigation by the governor of @entity67 following a local police cover - up resulted in involuntary manslaughter convictions for the deputy warden and guard			2
in the 1950s , medical testing a programme of medical testing began at @entity13			2
hidden city claims experiments were carried out on inmates on behalf of private clients			2
the @entity80 was also said to have tested more than a dozen psychotropic drugs there during the course of a decade			2
the programme ended in 1974			2
in 1973 , two prisoners stabbed warden @entity86 and his deputy @entity87 to death			2
the current county jail , @entity90 , was named after them			2
@entity13 finally closed its doors in 1995			2
cell : a bed sits by the window , which the occupant would have spent much of his time gazing from ( left )			1
a tree appears to have taken hold in the picture on the right crumbling : paint is peeling from the wall in great chunks ( right ) , but the toilet and sink can be clearly made out			1
graffiti has been daubed on the wall ( left ) the @entity108 was designed by architect @entity109 and opened its doors in 1837			1
also known as @entity111 , it was located over two storeys and had 300 cells , with each one fitted with running water and toilet facilities			2
but when a new prison was opened in 1970 , @entity33 was closed down			2
according to @entity119 website , it is the oldest building in the county and is on the national register of historic places			0
in 1991 scenes for the @entity124 , a film starring @entity126 , were shot at the prison			1
ten years later a fire took hold in the building causing considerable damage			0
nothing is being done to bring the building back into use , and it is said to be a retreat for squatters , dealers and drug - addicts			0
solitary confinement : one of the last prisoners to occupy this cell ticked off the days until he was released			1
he clearly believes he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice abandoned : graffiti now adorns the wales of old @entity147 in @entity11 , @entity12 , which finally closed its doors in 1970 after 133 years cafeteria : the crumbling bricks , paintwork , and debris on the floor disguise the fact this used to be the place where inmates ate their meals			0
a sign on the far wall warns that all kitchen staff must wash their hands @entity8 , who lives in @entity14 , @entity67 , began his journey to document abandoned sites a decade ago while researching the decline of the state hospital system			1
he said : ' i want to be able to convey the respect , appreciation and awe that i have for the locations i visit			0
trying to tell someone about a place conveys so little compared to being able to show it to them			0
' my favourite part of exploring ruins is that to me , it is peaceful			0
i can focus on what i am seeing and experiencing rather than being wrapped up in my thoughts all the time			0
' discovering new or intriguing places , finding something you know not many people have seen , or managing to get permission to somewhere you 'd really like to see are also a lot of fun			0
' these places also help me appreciate the comforts of the waking world when i return to it			0
' open wide : a dental chair , complete with check - up equipment has been abandoned			0
one can only guess at how gentle the dentist would have been realising that words alone could not adequately convey the harsh realities of institutional care , @entity8 embarked on a journey to visit and photograph crumbling state schools and asylums all over the @entity5			1
ten years later , @entity8 's focus has broadened to include the ruins of @entity5 infrastructure , industry , churches , schools , theaters , hospitals , prisons , resorts and hotels			1
he added : ' the @entity219 's @entity218 was a favourite of mine , but i love different things about each place i 've visited			1
' sometimes it can get scary , especially if a place is really structurally unstable , that would probably be my biggest concern			0
i also do n't want to get murdered for my camera gear or arrested			0
' there have been several occasions where i have had close calls with security and police , but thankfully nothing that has ever proven to be a long - term issue			0
' i try to be very quiet and careful to avoid anybody when i am photographing a location , and if i do run into anyone am polite and respectful , i try to get across the fact that i am not vandalising , damaging , or stealing anything			0
i have been lucky that so far that has been enough			0
' derelict : @entity13 in @entity14 has been abandoned for so long , even the graffiti is now peeling off the wall along with the plaster from @entity250 in @entity251 to the @entity253 's aircraft graveyard in @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity248 's extensive collection of derelict sites is one of the largest ever amassed			1
his work has gained international attention and he is considered a leading expert on urban blight and the efforts to preserve @entity5 's endangered architectural history			1
' i do quite a bit of research about the locations to try to find them			0
i also get tips from people who follow my work , and network with others who have similar interests			0
' i am very fortunate to have a fantastic family that has never discouraged me from doing what i do and has been very supportive of it all along			0
' many of my friends are the same way , although there are certainly those that just do n't find it interesting or follow it as much and we get along for other reasons			0
' my current goal is figuring out new ways to make sites more accessible and raise funds for site maintenance or restoration efforts , as well as continuing to add to the amount of locations i photograph			0
' i am typically pretty busy , always working out how to take things one step further and help people understand what is so important about them , both historically and in terms of their cultural significance to our own era			0

photographer @entity8 has captured the *haunting* atmosphere of the once *feared* institutions
paint and plaster crumbles off the walls that once harboured @entity5 's *toughest* *criminals*
but some eerie *reminders* remain of the despair that convicts were once *subjected* to
in one shot , a prisoner has ticked off the days he has left to spend in solitary confinement asking ' for what ? '
