' all i knew was that the people that i met could n't get out , ' @entity1 , who was born to @entity50 parents in @entity3 , told @entity15 ' 60 minutes in a special interview			1
' and they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out ... i work on the motto that if something 's not impossible , there must be a way of doing it			0

when he returned to @entity3 , he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task convincing the @entity72 authorities to take them			1
he pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an established refugee organization , adding ' @entity75 ' to its header and making himself chairman , @entity15 reported			0

his mother and volunteers also helped at the office			0
he said he contacted @entity93 authorities to take the children , but they said they were unable			0
but @entity72 authorities said they would take them if @entity1 found each one a home , so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families would take them			1
when he had secured them homes , the youngsters were ready to leave - but he found that the @entity72 authorities were slow to issue their travel documents			1
plot : he had no experience in such matters so when he got back to the @entity72 , he got a printing press and forged headed paper saying he worked for the @entity108 for refugees rescuer : @entity111 , pictured in @entity11 in 1938 with a young boy , kept his involvement quiet for 50 years desperate to help the children get out , he forged their documents and also paid off officials , he said			1

that 's the main thing			0
' the first children left @entity11 on march 14 , 1939 - just hours before @entity125 troops occupied @entity11			1
eventually , seven trains carried more than 600 children to @entity128 , where they caught ferries to @entity32			1
the @entity33 allowed them to leave , happy that the country was being ' cleansed ' of @entity9			0
another train was scheduled to leave on september 1 , but was stopped by the declaration of war			0
@entity1 said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived			1

saved : among the children saved were 14 - year - old @entity142 , left , and 10 - year - old @entity137 , right thankful : @entity142 , who now lives in @entity143 , @entity144 , said she only heard @entity1 's name after 50 years survivor : @entity137 said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents ' i remember that they told us that we were going to @entity32 maybe two or three months , ' he said			1
' it would be a holiday for us			0
and that they would join us very shortly thereafter ... ' but his parents never came for him , and their names are now painted on the walls of @entity11 's @entity156 , where every @entity30 jew who was murdered in the @entity158 is remembered			1
also among the children was 14 - year - old @entity142 , now 88 and living in @entity143 , @entity144			2
she recounted her mother handing her items , including a delicate , embroidered nightgown , to take on the train when she left for @entity32			1
she never saw her parents again			0
' many survivors feel guilty for having survived - i feel very grateful to my parents , ' she said			2
' our parents ' courage , i think , is the most important because most people said , " we will go together or not at all "			2
' after the war , @entity1 trained pilots for the @entity174 , married , raised a family and lived comfortably			2
he cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly			2

' i did n't really keep it secret , ' he told @entity15			0

' but in 1988 , his wife @entity193 found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children , their parents and the families that had taken them			2

@entity1 , then 29 , spent his 2 weeks vacation in 1938 traveling to @entity11 to see how he could help save people
he left with lists of hundreds of children and forged headed paper claiming he worked for the @entity229 for refugees
after finding homes for the children in @entity32 , it was taking too long to finalize their documents so he forged many and *bribed* officials
he saved 669 kids - many of whose parents died in concentration camps
he kept his story quiet for nearly 50 years before featuring on a @entity72 tv show and even the children did not know he had saved them
a book about his story - written by his daughter - is released next month
