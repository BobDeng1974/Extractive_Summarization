being afraid of getting old is a common complaint among both men and women in modern society			0
but while most people might try and slow down the process with the odd pot of anti-ageing serum , one 59 - year - old housewife from @entity5 is so terrified of ageing that she has spent over £ 50,000 on 60 operations in a bid to completely halt the process			1
explaining herself , @entity13 said : ' i do n't want to look old and i 'll do whatever necessary to stop the process			1
growing old disgracefully : @entity13 says she 's prepared to do whatever it takes to keep her youthful looks ' a friend of my sister 's came up to me at her wedding and asked me if i was her mother			1
i did n't react at the time , although i wanted to kill her , but when i got home i looked in the mirror and asked myself why she might think think i was sister 's mother			1
' @entity13 examined her face closely : ' i thought to myself , yes , you 've got a turkey neck , lines like the @entity32 and centipedes round the eyes			1
i screamed and cried and thought , yes , time for a facelift ! ' she began her bid for youth and beauty with an upper and lower eyelid reduction and a partial facelift and since the first surgery in 1999 , has had more than 50 procedures			1
' it was about six months later [ after the first operation ] that i started to feel better and thought " yes , i can deal with this " , ' she explains , adding : ' it 's changed my life beyond recognition			0
' natural : @entity13 says she wo n't have extreme surgery because she wants a naturally youthful look as she was : @entity13 ( right ) pictured at her sister 's wedding in 1999 before she had surgery ' i think i now appreciate the things that can be tamed with cosmetic surgery and that makes me less willing to tolerate things i do n't like			1
if it 's easy and i can go and do it , then i will go and do it			0
' her next operation is a breast lift and she 's planning to travel to @entity63 to get the perfect perky pair			0
' the distance does n't come into it really , ' she reveals			0
' i just need the boobs ! she continued : i think my boobs look quite old at the moment , they 're not as saggy as some i 've seen but they do look like they 're getting on towards 60 , which i will be on my next birthday			0
' to have the boobs of a 29 - year - old would be a bonus			0
' appearing in @entity77 documentary , 200 nips and @entity79 and i want more , @entity13 is seen travelling to the @entity81 capital for the operation			1
' if the surgery works , i will definitely be going braless on my 60th birthday , ' she reveals			0
' my friends and family will think i 'm a bit of a tart but i do n't care ! ' i will buy a nice silk dress and wear nothing underneath			1
i 'm very blase about the operation and i do n't get worried about it because i know i 've spent time choosing the right surgeon , anaesthetic , clinic and everything else			2
' after the operation , @entity13 is seen inspecting her new breasts which , much to her delight , are just what she 'd hoped for			2
changing faces : @entity13 at 59 looks younger than she did 10 years ago thanks to her love of surgery happier : @entity13 says her ultimate triumph will come when she 's a gorgeous corpse in her coffin ' all of me probably looks about 45 but my boobs are 30 , ' she burbles			1
' i do n't think people can tell i 've had surgery because i try to keep it natural			2
she adds : ' i will never grow old gracefully - i will grow old as disgracefully as i possibly can			0
i do n't think i have an addiction			0
' if there 's something i do n't like about myself , i will have it corrected			2
that 's not an addiction			0
the ultimate triumph for me will be when i 'm a good - looking corpse ! ' see @entity13 in action on @entity121 and @entity79 and i want more , available to watch now on @entity122			2
