by @entity0 published : 07:48 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 18:43 est , 24 october 2013 as a prisoner of war , @entity1 had plenty of time on his hands			2
but at least as he waited to take part in the @entity8 , the @entity6 bomber pilot had an elegant timepiece with which to watch the hours tick down			2
it was a @entity12 3525 – and it was delivered to him in the @entity14 ’ notorious @entity16 camp from the watchmaker ’s headquarters in @entity19 after he bought it by mail order in 1942 for £ 170 – the equivalent of £ 5,000 today			1
timeless : the @entity12 watch worn by @entity23 prisoner of war flight lieutenant @entity1 as he helped dig tunnels for the famous ' @entity8 ' attempt from the @entity16 camp is to go on sale at auction during preparations for the imaginative but ill - fated breakout , flight lieutenant @entity1 acted as one of the ‘ penguins ’ who dispersed the soil dug from the tunnels through enlarged pockets in their trousers as they exercised in the compound			1
but come the actual escape in march 1944 he was number 172 in the queue of pows ... and the @entity45 had discovered what was going on before he made it into one of the three tunnels			1
the story casts light on a surprising marketing enterprise whereby @entity53 , @entity12 ’s owner , sold the watches on credit to @entity23 pows during the @entity57 , allowing them to pay when the war was over			2
he only made the offer to @entity23 officers because they were seen as honourable gentlemen			0
they were invited to write to him on postcards explaining their circumstances and whereabouts and which @entity12 they wanted			0
replacement : @entity19 watchmaker @entity12 had offered all @entity23 officer @entity44 one of their timepieces to replace the ones seized by the @entity45 , on condition they pay for them after the war honour : the @entity12 deal was only made to @entity23 officers as they were seen as honourable gentlemen survivor : f / lt @entity1 wore the @entity82 watch on the hellish forced marches through @entity45 to evade the advancing @entity85 in the winter of 1945 details of flt lt @entity1 ’s case came to light yesterday as his watch emerged for sale			1
the watch is likely to fetch £ 30,000 when it is auctioned on november 6			1
he was captured after his @entity94 bomber was hit by flak , following an attack on @entity97 , and crashed into the @entity98 in 1941			0
he was sent to @entity16 – at @entity99 in eastern @entity45 – the camp made famous by the 1963 film @entity102 starring @entity103 , which immortalised the audacious bid for freedom by @entity107 prisoners there			1
seventy - three of the 76 who did escape were recaptured and 50 of them executed			0
@entity6 personnel ’s military issue watches were often seized by the @entity45 troops who captured them			2
but once in the pow camps , some 3,000 are thought to have taken up mr @entity53 ’s offer			0
attempt : f / lt @entity1 , fourth from left at @entity16 camp			1
he was allocated position 172 in the queue of @entity44 to escape but never made it into the tunnel as the @entity45 guards discovered the break - out prized : f / lt @entity1 was made a member of the @entity125 , for those who have jumped by parachute from an aircraft into the water , or whose aircraft crashed in the water , in 1943 artifact : the reverse side of the prized @entity135 card flt lt @entity1 , who had married his wife @entity136 only two months before he was captured , remained a @entity44 for the rest of the war			1
the watch survived intact even though he wore it on the forced marches without adequate food or protection that @entity44 endured as the @entity14 evaded the advancing @entity85			2
he was eventually liberated from another pow camp in may 1945			0
after the war , flt lt @entity1 , from @entity145 , @entity146 , returned to his job as a civil servant with the @entity150			1
he had four children and nine grandchildren			0
treasured : f / lt @entity1 is pictured wearing his treasured timepiece as he relaxes with wife @entity136 in the 1980s home front : during his time at the camp @entity155 would have been cheered by the thought of his wife , pictured in 1944 , who wrote to him from their home in @entity162 he did not pay for the watch until a couple of years after the war because of @entity23 currency restrictions			1
he treasured it until he died in 2003 aged 85 and his last wishes were for the timepiece to one day be sold so his family could benefit			2
it is now being auctioned for his grandchildren by @entity173 in @entity174			0
@entity175 , from the auction house , said : ‘ airmen who were kept in @entity179 camps were treated quite well and there would have been a gentlemen ’s agreement for the @entity44 to order these watches			0
the model flt lt @entity1 chose was one of the top @entity12 made at the time			1
’ reworking history : the 1963 film @entity102 was based on real events , and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people , or amalgams of several of those involved in the spring of 1943 , @entity6 squadron leader @entity193 conceived a plan for a major escape from the @entity45 @entity196 near @entity99 , now @entity99 in @entity197			1
with the escape planned for the night of march 24 , 1944 , the @entity44 built three 30ft deep tunnels , named @entity200 , so that if one was discovered by the @entity45 guards , they would not suspect that work was underway on two more			1
@entity193 intended to get more than 200 men through the tunnels , each wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment			2
to hide the earth dug from the tunnels the prisoners attached pouches of the sand inside their trousers so that as they walked around it would scatter			0
the prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges made by the sand and were referred to as ' penguins ' because of their supposed resemblance to the animal			0
when the attempt began it was discovered that @entity228 had come up short and instead of reaching into a nearby forest , the first man in fact emerged just short of the tree line , close to a guard tower			2
plans for one man to leave every minute was reduced to 10 per hour			0
in total 76 men crawled through to initial freedom , but the 77th was spotted by a guard			0
in the hunt for the entrance one guard @entity238 crawled through the tunnel but after becoming trapped at the other end called for help			0
the prisoners opened the entrance , revealing the location			0
of the escapees 73 were captured , and 50 of them executed			0
the @entity249 film the 1963 film @entity102 was based on real events , and although some characters were fictitious many were based on real people , or amalgams of several of those involved			1
the film starred @entity103 as captain @entity102 , @entity258 as flight lieutenant @entity259 and @entity260 as squadron leader @entity261 , and was based on a book of the same name by @entity264			1
contrary to the film no @entity267 pows were involved in the escape attempt , and there were no escapes by motorcycle or aircraft			1
@entity274 ' dash for the border by motorcycle was added by request of @entity103 , who did the stunt riding himself except for the final jump .			0
