by @entity0 published : 05:51 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 09:58 est , 27 january 2014 it might seem like blue - sky thinking , but this concept for a highrise farm may just make the utopian vision of sustainable cities a reality			1
@entity10 architect @entity9 has designed a 132 - floor ‘ urban farm ’ which he claim is the answer to a healthier future for the estimated six billion people who will live in cities by 2050			1
imagine , he says , stepping out of your highrise apartment into a sunny , plant - lined corridor , biting into an apple grown in the orchard on the fourth floor			1
the vertical farm is shaped like the wings of a dragonfly and the design of @entity10 architect @entity9			2
he believes it is the answer to a healthier future for the six billion people who will live in cities by 2050 you take the lift to your office , passing the rice paddy and one of the many gardens housed in the glass edifice that not only heats and cools itself , but also captures rainwater and recirculates domestic waste as plant food			2
this , claims mr @entity9 , is the city of the future			0
he envisions a self - sufficient ‘ living organism ’ of avant - garde buildings which some critics have dismissed as daft or a blight on the landscape			1
‘ we need to invent new ways of living in the future , ’ the 36 - year - old designer told @entity51 at the @entity53 studio where he plies his trade			1
‘ the city of tomorrow will be dense , green and connected			2
the goal is to bring agriculture and nature back into the urban core so that by 2050 ... we have green , sustainable cities where humans live in balance with their environment			0
’ @entity10 architect @entity9 ( pictured ) claims his ideas were initially met with criticism			0
' they made fun of me , ' he said			0
' they said i created a piece of science fiction ' the structure includes areas for meat , dairy and egg production , orchards , meadows and rice fields along with offices and flats , gardens and public recreation spaces it is estimated that food production will have to increase by 70 percent by 2050 to meet human demand			1
@entity89 already consumes more than 30 percent of the world 's land area -- cropland alone accounts for 10 percent			0
about 3.5 billion people , half the world population , live in cities today , up from 13 percent a century ago			0
by 2030 , the urban share will swell to 60 per cent , rising further to 70 percent by 2050 when the world 's occupants will number over nine billion			0
the world 's cities occupy only two percent of land on @entity103 , but account for 60 - 80 per cent of energy consumption and about 75 percent of planet - warming carbon emissions			1
by 2050 , about 15 billion hectares ( 37 billion acres ) or five percent of global land , will be covered by built - up areas			0
sources : @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 each building , he said , must ultimately be a ‘ self - sufficient , mini-power station			2
’ the quest for sustainable urban living has never been more urgent as people continue flocking to cities which encroach ever more onto valuable rural land , gobbling up scarce natural resources and making a disproportionate contribution to pollution and @entity103 - warming carbon emissions			2
enter mr @entity9 with his project ‘ dragonfly ’ - a design for a massive , twin - towered , ‘ vertical farm ’ on @entity129 's @entity128			1
from each tower springs a large , glass - and - steel wing , so that the edifice resembles the insect after which it was named			2
the structure includes areas for meat , dairy and egg production , orchards , meadows and rice fields along with offices and flats , gardens and public recreation spaces			1
energy is harvested from the sun and wind , and hot air is trapped between the building ‘ wings ’ to provide heating in winter			1
in summer , cooling is achieved through natural ventilation and transpiration from the abundant plant growth			0
plants grow on the exterior shell to filter rain water , which is captured and mixed with liquid waste from the towers , treated organically and used as fertiliser			0
and at the base of the colossus is a floating market on the @entity166 for the inhabitants to sell their organic produce			0
‘ they made fun of me			0
they said i created a piece of science fiction , ’ mr @entity9 says of his detractors			0
but as awareness has grown of the plight of our planet , overpopulation and climate change , his ideas have gained traction , and the dragonfly design has been exhibited at an international fair in @entity185			0
at the base is a floating market on the @entity166 for the inhabitants to sell their organic produce mr @entity9 has also drafted a concept for a floating city resembling a lily pad that will house refugees forced from their homes by climate change			0
and he hopes to sell a design for a ‘ farmscraper ’ in @entity197 , @entity185 that will include housing , offices , leisure space and food gardens			1
as yet , mr @entity9 has found no buyers for these big projects			2
‘ with the recent economic recession , politicians and government may ... have been reluctant to venture into such new , large - scale endeavours that have not been tested before , ’ @entity204 , a sustainability expert at the @entity206 , told @entity51 and similar projects			1
but she pointed out the concept has inspired other , smaller projects			1
plants grow on the exterior shell to filter rain water , which is captured and mixed with liquid waste from the towers , treated organically and used as fertiliser ‘ instead of majestically tall bionic towers plonked in riverbeds , vertical farms have been rather more modestly integrated into existing buildings , derelict industrial sites and floating barges , ’ said ms @entity204			1
one example is the @entity227 -- a nine - storey office building in @entity229 that allows employees to grow their own food in specially reserved green spaces at work			1
‘ whilst the buy - in may not be as noticeable at the moment , it certainly is widespread and growing , ’ said ms @entity204 of the vertical farm movement			1
‘ i suspect most other new vertical farms will remain hidden in disused urban spaces or existing business and domestic blocks , which is not bad at all as they will use fewer resources to be set up and enhance their surrounding environments and communities			2
’ mr @entity9 with another of his designs , the @entity247			0
designed to mimic two encircling hands , the towers are organised around a central core that allows for what the design team call a ' hyper - abundance of suspended gardens '			0

highrise includes orchards , meadows and rice fields along with offices
energy is stored from sun and wind , and heat is trapped by tower 's ‘ wings ’
no buyer has been found but the concept has inspired smaller projects
@entity229 's nine - storey @entity227 , for example , allows employees to grow their own food in reserved green spaces at work
