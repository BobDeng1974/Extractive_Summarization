by @entity0 , education correspondent gcses are the ‘ new 11 - plus ’ as top universities are increasingly using them as a way to weed out candidates for degree courses , according to an @entity8 don			1
dr @entity9 warned that the approach disadvantages late bloomers in the same way as the 11 - plus , which determines entrants to grammar schools			1
dr @entity9 , a historian based at @entity17 , admitted that @entity8 was ‘ as guilty as anybody else in that ’			1
exams : gcses are increasingly used by top universities to weed out degree candidates , claims an @entity8 don advice to candidates from the university states that it ‘ could not be optimistic of an applicant ’s chances of gaining a place at @entity8 without a high percentage of a * and a grades at @entity32 ’			1
dr @entity9 admitted that , as a late starter , he would have failed to reach @entity8 ’s high gcse standards himself			1
many of the most sought - after courses at other competitive universities use high gcse grades as a filter to decide which candidates to shortlist			2
but critics are concerned that this approach could harm the chances of students who blossom post- 16 , particularly those from less well - off backgrounds or lower - performing schools , who may be unaware of the high gcse entry requirements needed for the top universities			2
warning : dr @entity9 ( pictured ) warned that the approach disadvantages late bloomers in the same way as the 11 - plus , which determines entrants to grammar schools the gcse is turning into a kind of the new grammar school 11 - plus type of qualification , ’ dr @entity9 told a conference held last week by @entity60 , a not - for - profit organisation that aims to get bright pupils from non-selective schools into leading universities			1
‘ @entity8 , i suspect , is as guilty as anybody else in that			1
certainly some , not necessarily @entity8 ’s , of our university programmes are setting a very high bar for young people trying to get gcses			2
' they ’ve got gcses but perhaps not high enough gcses at that particular stage			0
i would have been counted among those			0
' the trouble is … that you ’re stymied if you do n’t get that first rung through the gcse process			0
’ dr @entity9 , an ‘ access ’ fellow at @entity17 who champions initiatives to broaden the mix of undergraduates , said he originally achieved three o - levels but went ‘ back into the education system ’ to gain more qualifications			1
‘ you ca n’t really do that now , ' he said			0
but dr @entity9 rejected a controversial proposal from a fellow speaker at the conference , professor @entity93 , who called for leading universities to apply a ‘ systematic or blanket ’ approach to admissions to increase their intake of disadvantaged pupils			1
it would raise the prospect of applicants ’ results being adjusted upwards according to various contextual factors , such as the overall performance of their school			0
professor @entity93 , assistant vice-chancellor of the @entity110 , said contextual data should be used ‘ systematically despite the @entity112 saying that a systematic or blanket approach to the use of contextual data is problematic ’			0
but dr @entity9 said the tactic could lead to ‘ the barbarians … dancing on the table ’			1
university : dr @entity9 , of @entity17 ( pictured ) , admitted that @entity8 was ' as guilty as anybody else in that '			1
he added : ' the trouble is ... that you 're stymied if you do n't get that first rung through the gcse process ' ‘ the reason a systematic access weighting is problematic is it takes away autonomy from the academics , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m not in favour of that because if you start down that road the barbarians will soon be dancing on the table , i ’m really not interested in that			0
’ in advice to applicants on its website , @entity8 says : ‘ there is no absolute requirement for particular grades at @entity32 , as there are no fixed examination results that must be attained for admission to @entity8			2
' each application is considered carefully on its individual merits			0
' when we look at gcse results , we look at them in the context of the overall performance of the school or college where you studied			0
so if , for example , you did n’t get all a * and a grades , but your results were among the best in your year group , that will be taken into account			0
‘ however , competition for places is strong and many applicants have all a * and a grades at gcse			0
unless there are particular extenuating circumstances , we could not be optimistic of an applicant ’s chances of gaining a place at @entity8 without a high percentage of a * and a grades at @entity32			2

gcses are ' new 11 - plus increasingly used to weed out degree candidates '
dr @entity9 claims the approach is disadvantageous to late bloomers
and he admits that @entity8 is ' as guilty as anybody else in that '
