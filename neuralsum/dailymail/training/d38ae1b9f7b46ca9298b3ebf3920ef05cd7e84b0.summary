exactly three years ago , the @entity1 cruise ship @entity2 crashed into rocks off the island of @entity5 , killing 32 people			1
the ship was only removed from the rocky outcrop near the @entity10 island after a two - year salvage operation			0
but while the cruise industry has since introduced new safety regulations , nearly a third of holidaymakers still believe ships are only built for show , rather than safety			2
on january 13 , 2012 , the @entity1 cruise ship , @entity2 , capsized off the coast of @entity10 unsurprisingly , in the weeks following the event , many travellers were deterred from cruising , which sending bookings plummeting by 26 per cent			1
since then , almost one - third ( 29 per cent ) of respondents polled still believe that modern ships are built mostly to impress , not for safety			2
a further 13 per cent of respondents admit to finding safety demonstrations on ships confusing , while 8 per cent reveal that they tend not to pay attention to safety demonstrations at all			2
however , another 39 per cent now believe that safety is top priority on board - especially in light of the introduction of 10 new safety procedures following the tragic ordeal , according to research carried out by cruise.co.uk			1
in the months following the sinking , new safety procedures for cruise travel have been implemented bookings initially dropped by 26 % following the accident and 29 % still believe ships are built only to impress new policies from @entity47 include advanced muster drills , which detail each passenger 's designated safety station and instruct on how to fit a life jacket , as well as the harmonisation of bridge procedures			1
seventy three percent of survey respondents said that they felt that safety standards have significantly enhanced over the last three years with a whopping 71 per cent even going so far as to say that they believe cruising to be a much safer means of travel than by plane			0
this may be , in part , attributed to the recent @entity63 and @entity64 tragedies			0
all respondents also claim that reports of freak accidents do not deter them from boarding a cruise ship			0
however , a shift in attitudes is evident - 39 % of @entity72 survey respondents believe safety is top concern interestingly , all polled revealed that these freak accidents do not deter them from boarding luxury liners @entity79 , managing director of @entity72 , comments : ' the sinking of the @entity2 was undoubtedly one of the most tragic and avoidable incidents in the cruise industry over the past decade , and it 's a hugely important day to commemorate			1
' as our survey shows , despite this tragedy , @entity85 cruisers subsequently have greater confidence when travelling and this is due to the commendable safety standards that are rife within our industry			0
' the @entity2 is an important reminder that safety is the primary concern for cruise liners , and we 're confident these standards will only continue to increase over the next decade			0

january 13 marks third *anniversary* of the tragic sinking of the @entity1 ship
in its wake , since 2012 , many new safety procedures have been introduced
however , attitudes in regards to the safety of cruise ships remains mixed
