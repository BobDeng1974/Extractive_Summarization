here , the governor is seen mid-veto in a photo she posted to @entity65 the governor said she gave the legislation careful deliberation in talking to her lawyers , citizens and lawmakers on both sides of the debate			0
the bill backed by @entity19 in the @entity75 was designed to give added protection from lawsuits to people who assert their religious beliefs in refusing service to gays			1
but opponents called it an open attack on gays that invited discrimination			0
gay rights supporters were delighted when they heard the official news of the veto signing at a rally held in @entity91 yesterday			1
gay rights supporters @entity93 , right , hugs @entity94 , after they learn @entity4 gov. @entity18 has vetoed @entity95 the bill has thrust @entity4 into the national spotlight after both chambers of the state legislature approved it			1
as the days passed last week , more and more groups , politicians and average citizens weighed in against @entity103 1062			0
many took to social media to criticize the bill , calling it an attack on gay and lesbian rights			2
prominent @entity91 business groups said it would be another black eye for the state that saw a national backlash over its 2010 immigration - crackdown law , @entity115 , and warned that businesses looking to expand into the state may not do so if bill became law			1
facing pressure ? three republicans who had voted for the bill last week quickly changed their minds and said in a letter to @entity125 that while the intent of their vote ' was to create a shield for all citizens ' religious liberties , the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance			1
' here , the governor announces the veto at a wednesday press event companies such as @entity139 and @entity140 and politicians including @entity19 sen. @entity142 and former @entity19 presidential nominee were among those who urged @entity125 to veto the legislation			1
@entity125 was under intense pressure to veto the bill , including from three republicans who had voted for the bill last week			1
they said in a letter to @entity125 that while the intent of their vote ' was to create a shield for all citizens ' religious liberties , the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance			1
' @entity115 1062 allows people to claim their religious beliefs as a defense against claims of discrimination			0
backers cite a @entity165 @entity164 decision that allowed a gay couple to sue a photographer who refused to document their wedding , even though the law that allowed that suit does n't exist in @entity4			2
@entity171 sen. @entity171 called his proposal a @entity174 issue during a @entity103 debate			0
' this bill is not about allowing discrimination , ' @entity171 said			0
' this bill is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith			0
' celebration : cheers erupted amid protestors of the bill after @entity125 's announcement was made surprised ? many feared the outspoken and often controversial governor might sign the bill into law as she dragged her feet with the saturday deadline to veto looming @entity194 said it was a veiled attempt to legally discriminate against gay people and could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defense			1
' the heart of this bill would allow for discrimination versus gays and lesbians , ' said sen. @entity206 , @entity207			0
' you ca n't argue the fact that bill will invite discrimination			0
that 's the point of this bill			2
' the bill is similar to a proposal last year brought by @entity171 but vetoed by @entity125 , a @entity19			1
that legislation also would have allowed people or religious groups to sue if they believed they might be subject to a government regulation that infringed on their religious rights			0
@entity171 stripped that provision from the bill in the hopes @entity125 will embrace the new version			2
civil - liberties and secular groups countered that @entity171 and the @entity229 , a powerful social conservative group that backs anti-abortion and conservative @entity231 legislation in the state and is opposed to gay marriage , had sought to minimize concerns that last year 's bill had far - reaching and hidden implications			2
good business ? the @entity238 will proceed as planned in @entity240 's @entity239			0
before the veto , @entity242 officials said the bill would put their decision to play in the state into question @entity171 called those worries ' unrealistic and unsupported hypotheticals ' and said criminal laws will continue to be prosecuted by the courts			2
the @entity229 argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law			0
' we see a growing hostility toward religion , ' said @entity258 , legal counsel for the group			0
similar religious - protection legislation has been introduced in @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 , but @entity4 's plan is the only one that has been passed by a state legislature			1
the efforts are stalled in @entity263 , @entity261 and @entity271			0
the push in @entity4 comes as an increasing number of conservative states grapple with ways to counter the growing legality of gay marriage			2
@entity4 's voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008			2
it is one of 29 states with such constitutional prohibitions , according to the @entity286			0
federal judges have recently struck down those bans in @entity289 , @entity266 and @entity290 , but those decisions are under appeal .			0

former first lady of the @entity12 backs @entity18 's decision
@entity125 faced a saturday deadline to choose whether to sign the bill and enormous pressure to veto even within her @entity19 ranks
the @entity303 set off a national row over gay rights and religious freedom
business leaders feared @entity4 could lose *investment* if the bill was signed , similar to the immigration crackdown of 2010
