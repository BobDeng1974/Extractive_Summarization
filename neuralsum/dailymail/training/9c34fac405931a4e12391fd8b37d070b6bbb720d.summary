by @entity0 @entity2 police have said an increasing number of migrants are risking their lives by hiding above ferry engines in a bid to get to new lives in @entity9			2
a pair of stowaways , aged 29 and 31 , were caught this week after making the 20 mile journey from @entity13 to southern @entity2 , just inches from the engine of a ferry			1
the pair were caught a week after a @entity18 man risked his life by balancing on a narrow metal platform above the propulsion system of a ferry			1
two hours later after clinging on despite the cold and the rise and fall of the ship , the ferry arrived in @entity37			0
but as the ferry reversed in order to dock , border guards spotted the stowaway and were waiting to arrest him when he swam ashore			0
police confirmed the @entity18 man did not have an entry visa and he was arrested and jailed , pending being deported back to @entity18			1
@entity2 police spokesman @entity51 , 43 , said : ' it was incredibly dangerous and if he had slipped it would have meant certain death			0
' yet it is an increasingly common way for people to try and enter the country , in fact this was the 31st person caught trying this trick so far this year			1
' police released the video of the failed attempt to warn people that they knew about the stunt , and that vessels are being checked each time as they start to come into port @entity32 , 20 , had put on a wetsuit and managed to clamber into position before the ferry set off also from @entity13 to the port of @entity37 , in the south @entity2 province of @entity39 police released the video of the failed attempt to warn people that they knew about the stunt , and that vessels are being checked each time as they start to come into port			2
@entity51 said : ' the disadvantage of this way of travel apart from being deadly is that they ca n't jump and swim to shore until the vessel stops otherwise they risk being sucked into the propellers			0
' that makes it relatively easy to catch them once the vessel has docked			0
