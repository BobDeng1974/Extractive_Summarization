@entity0 has finally adapted to life at @entity2 and is finally ready to show his best form , according to former @entity5 captain @entity4			1
the @entity6 looked completely out of place last season following his Â£ 27.5m move from @entity9 in the closing minutes of the 2013 summer transfer window			0
indeed , the 26 - year - old was a convenient scapegoat for the shortcomings of the @entity15 era at @entity2 with his lightweight performances in midfield			0
@entity0 impressed for @entity2 against @entity18 on sunday and has finally started to find his feet at @entity5 following a poor first season at the club the powerful @entity6 helped @entity2 to a 1 - 1 draw against @entity24 leaders @entity18 on sunday but even though an ankle injury delayed him at the start of this season , @entity0 is starting to show his true ability under @entity29			1
he came off the bench to score in last monday 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity32 and produced an excellent performance to help @entity2 to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity18 on sunday			2
and @entity4 , who played for the club between 1981 and 1994 , believes @entity0 finally fits in at @entity2			1
' i think @entity0 has been one of these players who 's come to @entity2 and found it totally different to any other club , ' he told the @entity40			2
@entity2 legend @entity4 believes @entity0 has finally adapted to the demands of life at @entity2 @entity4 at the peak of his powers , playing for @entity2 against @entity45 in 1984 ' the expectations , and the way @entity2 are expected to play football from the fans			1
' the first season , he did n't really find his feet , but i think he knows what it 's all about now and the last couple of performances have been very good			0
' he 's found where he is			0
he knows what 's expected now and he seems to have settled down and is playing the football he was playing for @entity9			0
' @entity0 's display against @entity18 - which was described as ' fantastic ' by striker @entity60 - means @entity61 is likely to start him in sunday 's derby with @entity63 at the @entity64			1
@entity0 announced his return to form with a well - taken goal in @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity32 last week @entity0 's return to form has given manager @entity29 a selection dilemma ahead of the @entity63 match the @entity6 could be the perfect player to take on the physical power of @entity73 and @entity74 in the centre of the park			1
@entity4 added : ' you have to have a physical presence against @entity18 and @entity63 because , if you 're weak , they 'll just roll over the top of you			2
' they 're big powerful teams and they 're successful			0
i can see @entity0 playing again because he 's the type of player we need against @entity63 to cope with them			0
