something quite ­ magical happens when great - grandmother @entity2 dances			1
­ shimmering in sequins , with a salsa swivel of the hips , she is ­ transformed from the 79 - year - old that she is into the ­ nimble young woman she once was			2
in the arms of her @entity12 dance ­ partner , @entity15 — 40 years her junior — the years melt away as he tosses her in the air in a series of graceful , gravity - defying moves which would leave most ­ pensioners needing an emergency hip replacement			1
‘ @entity15 throws me round like a whirling dervish			2
but i do n’t even feel stiff ­ afterwards , which is really quite amazing , ’ explains @entity2 , who last saturday became an ­ overnight sensation when her ­ @entity25 ’s @entity24 audition was shown			1
quite a feat in itself			2
gold tickertape rained down on her snowy white hair — which was perfectly shampooed and set — when @entity35 ’s ­ fellow judge @entity42 , pressed the golden buzzer , ­ catapulting @entity2 into next month ’s live semi-finals			1
quite how @entity2 and @entity15 plan to top last saturday ’s performance remains to be seen , but let ’s hope it wo n’t require the ­ presence of an ­ ambulance waiting in the wings			1
‘ i know my limits , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ @entity15 wanted to try out a new move in rehearsals which involved going down on my haunches			0
‘ well , i managed to get down , but i could n’t get up again			0
we had to scrub that			0
‘ sometimes @entity15 will get out the crash mats when we are trying something new , but he has never dropped me yet			0
’ the 79 - year - old made it into the @entity61 as the world 's oldest ­ acrobatic salsa dancer @entity64 is the perfect ­ @entity25 ’s @entity24 contestant , ­ possessing the essential ‘ wow ’ ­ factor and a ­ moving back story			1
a trained ballerina , she started dancing at the age of two - and - a - half and became a ­ professional ­ performer until she gave it all up after marrying her late ­ husband @entity72			1
@entity2 , a former dental nurse and fabric shop owner from ­ @entity75 , @entity76 , who retired to @entity12 with @entity72 in 2001 , only took up dancing again ten years ago			1
devastated after her husband ’s death from leukaemia in 2003 , she found herself widowed and alone in a foreign country			1
their four adult ­ children and grandchildren were back in @entity25 , although they tried to visit as often as possible			1
so to fill her lonely evenings and learn to have fun again she started taking salsa classes at @entity15 ’s dance academy in @entity90 near @entity91			0
the rest , as they say , is television history			0
today @entity2 is being hailed as the dancing equivalent of @entity96 , who in 2009 stunned the @entity98 judges and the world when she sang i dreamed a dream from @entity102			1
when i meet her , the gloss has been somewhat wiped off her achievement , with some critics ­ suggesting she had no right to be on the show			2
in the wake of her jaw - dropping performance it emerged that @entity2 and @entity15 — far from being plucked from obscurity — had in 2009 won a @entity12 tv talent ­ contest called @entity117 ( @entity118 )			1
the following year the couple ­ competed in the @entity119 , from which they were voted off in round 11			0
that year , @entity2 made it into the @entity61 as the world ’s oldest ­ acrobatic salsa dancer			1
on @entity126 , @entity35 defended his newest star , saying ‘ do n’t knock @entity2			1
she is ­ @entity25 and wants the chance to perform in front of the @entity131			1
’ a spokesman for @entity98 , made by @entity133 and @entity35 ’s ­ production company @entity134 , added : ‘ anyone can apply for ­ @entity25 ’s @entity24 , ­ irrespective of their past ­ experience			1
‘ none of the judging panel had seen or knew of @entity2 before her audition and her act was a ­ complete surprise to them			1
’ the @entity25 's @entity24 judges were wowed by @entity2 's performance , especially @entity42 , who pressed the golden buzzer for them @entity2 , who will be 80 in july , finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about			1
‘ i ’m @entity25 and i ’ve got ­ talent , so why should n’t i enter ? ’ she asks , slightly flummoxed by the ­ brouhaha			1
‘ it ’s a terrible thing to admit — ­ neither of us knew anything about the show			2
i think my son @entity160 mentioned it to me			0
i really did n’t think we ’d stand a cat ’s chance in hell of ­ getting through			0
’ despite the furore , who could ­ honestly begrudge this soon - to - be octogenarian her late - life moment in the sun ? ‘ i ’m very active and young at heart , ’ explains @entity2 , who has seven grandchildren aged from eight to 32 , and a great - grandson aged three			1
‘ i once overheard one of my son ’s friends at a fancy dress party asking “ is your @entity179 ever going to grow up ? ” i ’d come as a pirate			0
’ the only child of a regimental ­ tailor , @entity2 performed in her first panto aged 12 and was working full - time in theatre when , aged 17 , she met @entity72 , an electrical engineer			1
‘ when we married i gave it up — it was my choice — because if you ’re working six days a week on stage you are going out for an evening show just as your better half is coming home from work , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ i missed dancing terribly , ­ especially as @entity72 had two left feet and did n’t know the difference between a quickstep and a waltz			2
but i never once regretted my ­ decision			0
family life was more important			0
’ daughter @entity202 , now aged 55 , was followed by three brothers @entity204 , 54 , a scout leader , @entity205 , 51 , a ­ computer scientist and @entity160 , 49 , a partner in an accountancy firm			0
@entity2 says she finds it hard to understand what all the fuss is about @entity2 kept her interest in @entity213 alive by founding the @entity214 — still going strong today			2
the couple , happily married for 47 years , retired to @entity12 after @entity2 collapsed on christmas eve 2000 with flu and @entity72 said he could n’t let her endure another ­ @entity25 ­ winter			1
they fell in love with a mountainside villa in @entity90 , and had sold their semi-detached ­ @entity222 home in the @entity224 when disaster struck			0
the day before they were due to fly out to sign the paperwork , @entity72 fell ill and was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia			0
the @entity12 villa lay empty for eight months while @entity231 underwent several rounds of ­ chemotherapy — keeping a picture of their dream home by his hospital bed to give him a morale boost			2
with @entity72 ’s cancer in remission , they finally moved to @entity12 in ­ september 2001 , only for the ­ leukaemia to return 18 months later			2
he was given two months to live after two further rounds of chemo failed			0
‘ i put his bed in the lounge ­ overlooking the valley , but when the doctor came he said @entity72 had a week or ten days left , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ our children made ­ immediate plans to fly out , but @entity72 died the exact time their plane took off from @entity25			2
when they arrived i had to tell them , “ i ’m sorry , it ’s too late , he ’s gone			0
” ’ in the wake of her jaw - dropping performance it emerged that @entity2 and @entity15 had in 2009 won a @entity12 tv talent ­ contest called @entity117 ( you are worth it ) ‘ by the end he was skin and bone , so i was prepared for his death and held him in my arms and talked to him at the end			1
everyone assumed i would come home , but i was determined to stay because we ’d been so happy			0
‘ i kept myself busy , gardening all day until it got dark and then ­ falling into bed exhausted			0
i did n’t have a ­ television , so when autumn came i thought i ’d better find something else to keep me busy			0
‘ i was the oldest person at @entity15 ’s by far , but salsa is very inclusive			0
men over there do n’t think , “ oh , i ca n’t dance with an old lady			0
” ‘ ‘ i think @entity15 was quite ­ surprised by what i could do , ’ says @entity2 , who is 4ft 11 and a ­ featherweight 7st			2
‘ one day he asked me how much i weighed and said “ @entity280 ” when i told him			0
the first time he tried to throw me in the air , he asked some other men to stand around him to catch me if i fell , but i just went for it			0
i did n’t even worry about being injured			0
’ @entity2 describes her relationship with @entity15 , who is unmarried , as being like that of mother and son			2
it was his idea to start entering ­ competitions : ‘ he could n’t find someone willing to be thrown up in the air except a silly , elderly widow			0
so could @entity2 and @entity15 win ­ @entity25 ’s @entity24 ? ‘ it would be an absolute honour for me to perform in front of the @entity300 , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ i went into dancing again because i was on my own			2
i just hope he ’d be proud of me now			0

@entity2 , 79 , wowed the judges on @entity25 's @entity24 with her dancing
but she only took up dancing 10 years ago after the death of her husband
and she insists she 's no fraud despite winning @entity12 tv talent show
