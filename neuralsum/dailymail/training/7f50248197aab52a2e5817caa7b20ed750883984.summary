@entity1 boss @entity0 will trial @entity2 as a deep - lying centre forward in training this week as he attempts to solve his club ’s chronic injury crisis			1
@entity1 face three matches this month without a fit striker after @entity11 injured his calf before kick - off at @entity14 and joined @entity15 and @entity16 on the casualty list			1
@entity19 ’s goal gave @entity1 their seventh straight win to keep them on @entity22 ’s tail at the top of the table but @entity15 is out until mid-january with a knee injury , @entity11 is unlikely to return until the new year and there are similar fears about @entity16 , who strained a hamstring against @entity29 last week			1
@entity2 will be trialed up front in @entity1 training this week by @entity0 @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) are also alternatives with @entity1 without a fit recognised striker @entity0 says @entity2 is a very useful player for the squad and may play as a deep - lying forward @entity0 will assess whether @entity32 , @entity31 or @entity2 can cope with playing as a false no 9 and also ask @entity38 if anyone from his development squad can step up			1
@entity41 , the 18 - year - old who replaced @entity11 on saturday , prefers to play in midfield while four @entity1 forwards — @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity48 ’s son @entity47 — are out on loan			1
the possibility of a new role for @entity2 is intriguing			2
‘ we will work this week with the players to see who can play best in that position			0
it can be @entity32 , it can be @entity31 , it can be @entity2 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we must decide which is the best one			0
i always said @entity2 is a very useful player for the squad			2
at some moments he wants to play more but wherever he plays he is important			0
that is why we ’ve kept him here			0
‘ @entity41 is not a striker			2
we must try to find another way to play because our strikers will be out for at least one month more			0
’ 18 - year - old @entity41 has played up top in recent weeks but he prefers to operate in midfield @entity41 replaced @entity11 against @entity14 - the @entity66 injured himself in the warm - up the mounting injury list could not have come at a worse time for @entity1			1
centre back @entity70 also pulled up with a recurrence of a hamstring injury , meaning more pressure will be put on veteran defender @entity74 alongside £ 32million summer signing @entity75			0
@entity0 believes it is a consequence of top players being worked too hard			2
‘ last year i remember playing nine games in december and nine games in january			0
it is difficult for the players to keep the high pace , because of the intensity of every game in the @entity84			0
’ the @entity1 boss would like to see the festive season reduced rather than ended			2
‘ i understand @entity87 is important for @entity89 football but if we play on the 26th , i do n’t know why we have to play on the 28th and january 1 , ’ he said			0
@entity0 will fight for reinforcements in january but at least he has @entity19			1
the 36 - year - old , on loan from @entity1 ’s parent club @entity93 , settled a dour match at @entity14 with a 40th - minute finish from @entity31 ’s cross for his 175th @entity84 goal			1
@entity70 is expected to miss the rest of 2014 after being taken off injured at the @entity100 @entity19 and @entity1 want his contract with the club extended until march but they need @entity104 permission both player and club want his loan spell extended until march but it will need permission from the @entity104 , who have promoted @entity19 as one of their biggest stars			1
@entity14 remain bottom of the table and yesterday sacked director of football @entity114			2
he was informed of the decision by chief executive @entity118			0
there are no suggestions that manager @entity122 ’s job is in danger			0
the 51 - year - old would not confirm interest in @entity126 , who plays for @entity127 in the @entity104 , but indicated he would like a goal poacher similar to the @entity130 man			1
@entity14 have collected only two points from 33 since beating @entity132 5 - 3 in september			1
@entity14 boss @entity122 refused to deny reports linking the club with @entity127 striker @entity126			0

@entity11 , @entity15 and @entity16 all out injured for @entity1
@entity41 played up front against @entity14 in 1 - 0 win on saturday
but @entity0 says *youngster* prefers to operate in midfield
admits @entity2 , @entity31 and @entity32 are striking options
@entity19 and @entity1 must wait for @entity104 *approval* to extend loan
