@entity0 is now only three short of sir @entity2 ’s goalscoring record after his double in @entity5 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity6 on tuesday night			1
@entity8 columnist and @entity10 pundit @entity7 says he is an @entity5 ‘ great ’ , but former @entity12 and @entity6 captain @entity11 claims his two - goal salvo was only ‘ against @entity15 players , so do n’t get carried away ’			1
so , is a @entity0 ‘ a great ’ - and what constitutes a ‘ great ’ @entity5 player ? we asked our team of reporters for their verdict			1
if @entity39 was around in the 1960s , @entity2 would be ‘ too slow ’ , @entity38 would n’t be able to play as a lone striker in a 4 - 5 - 1 , @entity42 would n’t be strong enough in the air … @entity0 is the greatest @entity5 player of his generation and has been let down by poor team - mates			1
he ’s scored 46 goals , we will miss him when he is gone			0
@entity48 was the best @entity5 player i saw in the flesh			2
he was a ‘ great ’ , a double @entity53 - and @entity0 is as good as @entity48 ( and has scored a lot more goals )			1
rooney scores @entity5 's third goal of a pulsating encounter at @entity57 on tuesday evening the @entity59 ace must now be considered an @entity5 great , according to @entity61 @entity60 @entity62 @entity0 is the best @entity64 player of a generation and has won numerous honours with @entity59 , but as an @entity5 player will he stand shoulder to shoulder with @entity2 and @entity70 when he overtakes them in the goalscoring charts ? for me , i 'm afraid it 's a no at the moment			1
@entity76 i ’m an enduring fan of @entity0 and he has played a central role in achieving great things during his 10 years at @entity79			2
sadly , he has never really had the platform to do the same with @entity5 and – largely because of injury – has never really been able to make a consistent impact at major tournaments			2
for me , great @entity5 players are those who have given me great @entity5 memories			2
@entity0 has n’t given me enough of these , so he falls short i am afraid			2
@entity70 celebrates scoring one of his two penalties against @entity89 at the @entity90 @entity0 lit up @entity91 , pictured scoring against @entity92 before being mobbed by his @entity5 team - mates @entity95 let 's use sir @entity2 as the barometer for greatness			1
he was in four @entity90 squads , has more than 100 caps and 49 @entity5 goals			2
@entity0 has been to three @entity102 , has more than 100 caps and now has 46 goals			2
he will become the country 's leading scorer , he could play in a fourth @entity90 and his place in the squad is beyond doubt at the moment , so he will go on winning caps			0
we can become too dewy - eyed looking back at former players in comparison with what those of the present are achieving			0
@entity0 might not have become the player everyone expected when he was 18 but he has still been outstanding			2
he ticks all the boxes needed to be classed as an @entity5 great			1
@entity0 is presented with his golden cap by sir @entity2 ahead of his 100th game for @entity5 @entity124 , in action for @entity5 in 1970 , holds the @entity5 goalscoring record with 49 strikes for his country @entity7 : he will become the greatest goalscorer for @entity5 , there is no doubt about that			1
he ’ll possibly beat the caps record as well			0
all week we have been saying , ' is he an @entity5 great ? ' ' where does he rank ? ' of course he is an @entity5 great , he is going to be our greatest goalscorer			1
is he a world great ? is he @entity136 , @entity137 ? no , he ’s not , but over these last 12 - 18 months there have been questions asked about @entity0			1
you go back to the @entity90 and people did n’t even want him in the team			0
he should always be in the @entity5 team			0
@entity11 : i would not get carried away with @entity0			1
he is just scoring goals against @entity15 players tonight			0
i agree with your first part where you say @entity0 has been a great player for @entity5 , but what adjective do you use to describe @entity0 if you are using ‘ great ' ? @entity136 and @entity137 are on different planets			1
@entity7 and @entity11 were speaking on @entity10 @entity153 @entity7 nailed it : of course he is an @entity5 ' great '			1
but is he one of the ' great ' players of this generation ? no. it 's a tough era in which to shine , what with @entity136 and @entity137 but @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 are also better in his position			0
and that 's before you start adding in great defenders and midfielders			0
but he is a very good player , world class and the dominant force for @entity5			0
we should be grateful to have him			0
@entity174 yes he is an @entity5 great			1
i do n't think that can be debated			0
youngest goalscorer , 101 caps and only serious injury can stop him passing sir @entity2 's long standing 49 - goal record			2
levels of greatness ? well , he has not conquered the world			0
he will not go down as a world great with @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 et al			0
there 's no shame in that			0
he has not won anything with @entity5 but only one team ever has , nearly 50 years ago			0
in the modern world of intense professional scrutiny , you might question if his lifestyle prevented him from maximising his full potential but he has been the best of his generation by some distance			0
@entity0 celebrates with a cartwheel after scoring his 46th goal for @entity5 against @entity6 on tuesday @entity206 is @entity0 an @entity5 great ? i ca n't believe we are even having this debate			1
just look at his goal record ; 46 in 101 caps			0
what else does he have to do ? that 's almost one in two for @entity5 - that goal ratio is excellent in anyone 's book			1
his failure , so far , to produce for @entity5 in a major tournament since @entity91 is perhaps the main reason why the jury 's still out for some people			2
but , for me , there 's no argument			0
@entity226 the fact we ’re having this debate – given his brilliant caps and goals record – proves there is something which just does n’t sit right with @entity0			2
for me , the source of this unease is his failure to develop himself into the world ‘ great ’ we all thought he would be – we ’re talking @entity137 and @entity136 territory			0
and that , too , seems a source of frustration for the player - he is , after all , the perennial angry man			0
@entity137 and @entity136 ahead of @entity245 's game against @entity246 at @entity79 on tuesday in an @entity5 shirt his record at major tournaments – barring @entity91 – is well documented and there has been no real magic memory in the best part of a decade for his country			1
and look at his goals record – he has scored four times against what you would call the very best international teams ( @entity260 twice , @entity246 and @entity261 ) but they were all in friendlies			0
sadly , i just ca n’t have him as an @entity5 great			1
@entity265 @entity0 is a great player , a great servant to @entity59 and increasingly a great figure in the game			2
he has approached the possibility of breaking sir @entity2 's record with real class			1
but he is not an @entity5 great because - often for reasons beyond his control - he has not delivered consistently at major tournaments			1
maybe , as @entity277 believes , we have not seen the best of @entity0 yet and he might go on to legitimately become an @entity5 great			1
but he 's not there yet			0
@entity0 has scored once in three @entity90 tournaments - he 's pictured here celebrating against @entity281 @entity282 @entity0 will undoubtedly go on to become @entity5 's top scorer , but so far only six of those have come at major tournaments – five in @entity286 and a meagre one at a @entity90			1
scroll through his list of @entity5 goals and i can pick out just five that have been scored against what would be considered the real big guns – one versus @entity246 , @entity261 and two against @entity260 , all in friendlies , and one against @entity281 at this summer 's @entity90			1
his trophy cabinet is crammed full of club silverware , but at present he is an exceptional player who is far from the realms of greatness			0
@entity299 i would n't put him anywhere near an all - time @entity5 xi. he ca n't compare with @entity301 ( hat - trick in a @entity90 final ) , @entity70 ( @entity90 golden boot ) , @entity305 ( leading scorer at @entity307 ) or even had a similar impact to @entity38 or @entity309			2
so in that respect he 's not really a great			0
his longevity is impressive , a lot of players who start young burn out			0
but he 's got to do it in a big match to cement his place among the pantheons ; a free - kick against @entity321 , penalty against @entity323 and a couple of goals in a friendly against @entity6 do n't really cut it when you think of @entity309 sprinting past @entity246 defenders to score a @entity90 classic in a match that mattered			1
@entity332 praises attack as @entity0 approaches record @entity0 speaks to boss @entity277 as @entity5 head home from @entity6 on tuesday night			1

@entity0 is now only three short of @entity338 's record for @entity5
the @entity5 captain scored twice in @entity5 's 3 - 1 win against @entity6
@entity7 says @entity0 must now be considered an ' @entity5 great '
but @entity11 claims we ' should not get carried away with @entity0 '
