by @entity0 and @entity1 recruit : private @entity3 , 18 , died from a gunshot at @entity6 barracks the family of a young @entity8 recruit who died from a single gunshot wound at @entity6 last night won a dramatic breakthrough in their 19 - year battle for justice			1
the attorney general , @entity14 , gave consent for the parents of @entity3 , 18 , to seek a new inquest after secret police evidence emerged			1
the move is almost certain to lead to new public hearings into what happened at the notorious barracks in @entity23 , where three other soldiers died in mysterious circumstances between 1995 and 2002			1
@entity26 , 17 , @entity27 , 20 , and @entity28 , 17 , also died from gunshot wounds , sparking allegations of bullying and abuse			1
the families have refused to accept the theory that all four soldiers committed suicide using their own rifles and have accused the @entity8 of a cover - up			0
des and @entity40 , @entity3 's parents , said : ' it 's truly an emotional day - it 's been a long and painful process , with so many hurdles , but we never considered giving up			0
' @entity3 had her whole life in front of her			0
when our young people lose their lives serving their country , not only do they deserve a full and independent investigation into their deaths , it must be their absolute right			0
' @entity3 was found dead from a single bullet wound to her head outside the notorious base in @entity23 in november 1995			1
@entity58 handed the matter over to the @entity8 and her death was immediately treated as suicide , despite previous descriptions of her as ' bubbly ' and ' happy '			0
@entity63 , which is representing @entity3 's family , said the original inquest lasted just an hour			2
the civil liberties group said key witnesses were n't called , medical records went uninspected and important evidence was ignored			2
an ' open ' verdict was recorded			0
concerns about the string of tragedies at @entity6 led @entity58 to open an investigation in 2002			2
officers took hundreds of statements and instructed forensic experts but concluded there was no evidence anyone else was involved in the shootings			2
attorney general @entity14 gave consent for the parents of @entity3 , 18 , to seek a new inquest after secret police evidence emerged controversially , the police flatly refused to give @entity88 and mrs @entity3 , from @entity89 , @entity90 , access to the files			1
last year , @entity63 threatened the force with legal action - prompting the police to finally cave in and hand over 44 volumes of files , including witness statements , documents , notes and photographs			2
some 70 per cent of the papers had never been seen before by @entity106 ' family			0
it was this new evidence that persuaded mr @entity14 to grant the family permission to apply for the new inquest			1
the request will now be formally considered by the @entity110 , but similar cases have ended in success			0
the @entity8 's @entity6 training camp , , where three other soldiers died in mysterious circumstances between 1995 and 2002			1
liberty solicitor @entity116 , who represents @entity3 's family , said : ' the attorney general 's decision gives @entity3 's grieving family a long - overdue chance to discover the truth			1
' until now their battle for answers has been repeatedly snubbed by a state that views the fundamental human rights of our troops as an optional extra			0
' this young girl was preparing for a career in service - the least her family deserves is justice			0
' the campaign group is planning to make a second application for an inquest on behalf of @entity27 , who died in 1995			1
earlier this month a coroner ruled at a second inquest that a royal military policewoman corporal @entity141 - @entity140 killed herself because of bullying and after an alleged rape			2
the 30 - year - old was tormented by fellow @entity146 after she accused two soldiers of attacking her during a drunken night out in @entity148			0
the hearing was a new inquest ordered after her family won a legal battle , also backed by @entity63			0
an earlier inquest , which found she committed suicide in october 2011 , did not hear any evidence about the rape allegations			1
last night a @entity159 spokesman said : ' our thoughts remain with the family and friends of private @entity3			0
' this decision is a matter for the attorney general and the courts			1
if a new inquest is ordered , we will of course provide support to the coroner when needed			0
' a fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud , irregularity of proceedings , insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence .			1

attorney general gives consent for new inquest to be sought
the move is almost certain to lead to new public hearings
it comes after new secret police evidence emerged
