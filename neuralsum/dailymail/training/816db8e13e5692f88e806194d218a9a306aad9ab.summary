by @entity0 with millions of pounds in the bank , you might have thought the world 's super-rich would n't have a care in the world			1
but a new survey has revealed the top fears of the world 's wealthiest people , and one of the most common is that their money is their children 's ambition and drive to do well			1
for the most successful - defined as those with fortunes of $ 10million ( £ 5.9million ) and above - worries about children 's motivation came second only to worries about their own health			1
@entity23 said his kids will not inherit his £ 180million fortune as the money will be an ' albatross around their necks ' according to the study , by law firm @entity31 , fears over children 's ambition come above worries about investments failing , inability to provide for the family , and even divorce			1
among those with a fortune of less than $ 10million the fear still ranked highly , but came in fourth place , behind health troubles and worries over income			1
the study found that , wealthy families have the most to fear from third generation family members when it comes to losing the family millions			2
@entity50 , a partner at @entity51 's , said : ' if the first generation are wealth creators then the second generation tend to be wealth preservers , but it is the third generation that families are most worried about			1
' if they have had everything put on a plate for them without seeing any of the hard graft that goes into creating that wealth , then they can lose track of how best to use that wealth and how ifficult it was to build up in the first place			0
' former police lead singer and musician @entity23 has today said he will not be passing on any of his £ 180million fortune to his children because he wants them to earn their money themselves			1
he said : ‘ i told them there wo n’t be much money left because we are spending it ! we have a lot of commitments			0
what comes in , we spend , and there is n’t much left			0
@entity82 previously said that not having to earn their own money ' ruins people ' while @entity86 was encouraged to get a job earning £ 2.68 an hour in a coffee shop by @entity89 and @entity90 ‘ i certainly do n’t want to leave them trust funds that are albatrosses round their necks			2
‘ they have to work			0
all my kids know that and they rarely ask me for anything , which i really respect and appreciate			0
‘ obviously , if they were in trouble i would help them , but i ’ve never really had to do that			0
they have the work ethic that makes them want to succeed on their own merit			0
’ celebrity chef @entity82 also said that her children will not be passed any of her own fortune , adding that ' it ruins people not having to earn their own money			2
' according to reports , @entity86 recently got a job in a @entity116 coffee shop earning £ 2.68 an hour after being encouraged to do it by parents @entity89 and @entity90 , who are worth an estimated £ 165million			2
the data , a rare insight into the minds of the world 's most powerful , was based on surveys of more than 4,500 and interviews with 16 very wealthy families from @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
families interviewed said they were using charitable donations or setting up a new business to give the family a renewed sense of direction			0
some even said they had drawn up a family statement , similar to a business statement , in order to give the next generation a purpose and something to achieve .			0
