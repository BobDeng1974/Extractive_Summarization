they are a breathtaking visualisation of just how quickly our planet is changing			0
@entity4 has released these astonishing images showing data collected from the @entity8 satellite from 1982 until 2012			1
they reveal everything from man 's impact on the desert as @entity14 expands to the retreat of glaciers in @entity17			1
animations may not be visible all devices the @entity20 of @entity21 , revealing two palm trees and a map of the world appear as islands off the coast as vast swathes of construction are undertaken @entity29 in @entity21 from nearer the ground : 14,000 laborers toiled day and night on the development each frame of the timelapse map is constructed from a year of @entity8 satellite data , constituting an annual 1.7 - terapixel snapshot of the @entity37 at 30 - meter resolution			1
the @entity8 program , managed by the @entity40 , has been acquiring images of the @entity37 's surface since 1972			1
@entity8 provides critical scientific information about our changing planet			1
@entity4 worked with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , @entity46 and @entity47 to develop the images , even digitising tapes containing the early data from the satellites			1
@entity4 worked with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , @entity46 and @entity47 to develop the site			2
' today , we 're making it possible for you to go back in time and get a stunning historical perspective on the changes to the @entity37 ’s surface over time , ' said @entity60 , an engineering manager at @entity4			2
' working with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , @entity46 and @entity47 , we 're releasing more than a quarter - century of images of @entity37 taken from space , compiled for the first time into an interactive time - lapse experience			0
' we believe this is the most comprehensive picture of our changing planet ever made available to the public			0
' the @entity68 in @entity70 retreating can clearly be seen in the first of the stunning timelapse images @entity68 on @entity73 , which has receded dramatically since 1984 , as the pictures above reveal @entity4 selected a range of images for the project , from the sprouting of @entity21 ’s artificial @entity79 , the retreat of @entity70 ’s @entity68 , the deforestation of the @entity83 @entity82 to urban growth in @entity14 from 1984 to 2012 : the images were collected as part of an ongoing joint mission between the @entity40 and @entity46 called @entity8			1
their satellites have been observing earth from space since the 1970s - with all of the images sent back to @entity37 and archived on @entity40 tape drives			0
watch as the @entity95 desert becomes irrigated and crop circles sprout throughout the terrain as - @entity98 in @entity95 , where a technique called circle pivot irrigation , fed by wells pumping fossil water from aquifer , is common ' we started working with the @entity40 in 2009 to make this historic archive of earth imagery available online , ' said miss @entity60			0
' using @entity109 technology , we sifted through 2,068,467 images — a total of 909 terabytes of data — to find the highest - quality pixels ( e.g. , those without clouds ) , for every year since 1984 and for every spot on @entity37			2
the @entity8 satellite imagery documents the loss of @entity120 forest land in @entity83 due to road - building , logging and agricultural clearing soybean fields butting up against a remaining @entity82 forest in the @entity83 state of @entity127 ' we then compiled these into enormous planetary images , 1.78 terapixels each , one for each year			1
' as the final step , we worked with the @entity133 at @entity134 , recipients of a @entity131 , to convert these annual @entity37 images into a seamless , browsable @entity137 animation			0
' the astonishing rate of urban development has spread out around @entity141 's biggest city over the decades the lit up expanse of @entity14 in the @entity141 desert @entity4 says the maps are ' profound images '			1
' much like the iconic image of @entity37 from the @entity150 mission - which had a profound effect on many of us - his time - lapse map is not only fascinating to explore , but we also hope it can inform the global community ’s thinking about how we live on our planet and the policies that will guide us in the future			0
a special thanks to all our partners who helped us to make this happen			0
' @entity165 's great salt lake @entity163 drying up			0
the @entity165 government blames climate change and drought for the dramatic changes , while critics blame the dams that have been built around the lake a woman walks n the water of the lake			0
the third largest salt water lake in the world , it is drying up fast , as experts fear another environmental disaster in the @entity181 the maps use @entity4 's @entity109 , which brings together the world 's satellite imagery , with trillions of scientific measurements dating back almost 40 years			1
@entity4 has made it available online with tools for scientists , independent researchers , and nations			2
the search giant says it hopes the resource will allow people to ' mine this massive warehouse of data to detect changes , map trends and quantify differences on the @entity37 's surface			2
' @entity202 spread across the surface of @entity204 , making the @entity206 mine in @entity204 's @entity207 the largest single coal mining complex in the world opened in 1977 , @entity206 is the second most productive mine in the @entity211 , providing the @entity211 with eight percent of its coal supply			0
