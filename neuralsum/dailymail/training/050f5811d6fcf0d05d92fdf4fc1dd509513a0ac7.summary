while none of his victims have ever publicly come forward , and the 67 - year - old never charged , reports of his misbehavior surfaced in october when his soon - to - be ex-wife @entity23 released a taped confession which was obtained by @entity25 in the midst of their bitter divorce			1
in the public backlash to the @entity25 tapes , @entity1 lost parts on tv show scandal and in the sequel to the movie @entity35 , while re-runs of @entity8 were pulled from the air			1
' forty years ago , i did something terribly wrong that i deeply regret			0
i have been working to atone for it ever since , ' @entity1 wrote in people			1
he says he 's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated			2
' on the recording , i described events that took place 20 , 32 , and 40 years ago , ' @entity1 adds			1
' the publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what i did that go far beyond what actually occurred			0
as difficult as this is , i want people to know the truth			0
' he says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973 , when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife			0
@entity1 says he exposed himself to the girl twice before , but took things to another level on the visit			2
' when the girl and i were watching tv alone , i moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately			0
it lasted less than a minute , during which there was no gratification , ' @entity1 said			2
' i then left the room			0
i had no further physical contact with her			0
it was a completely impulsive act and it 's haunted me ever since to think of what i put her through			0
reports about his indiscretions first came to light in october when his estranged wife @entity23 ( pictured together on the right ) released a taped confession which was obtained @entity25 over the next two decades , @entity1 says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls , once in 1982 and again in 1994			1
' the first instance lasted second and the second about a minute , ' @entity1 says of the indecent exposure			1
' i had no physical contact of any kind with either girl			0
i do n't say this to excuse what i did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened			0
' @entity1 says the exposure in 1994 was his ' rock bottom ' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior			1
for the past twenty years , @entity1 says he 's undergoing therapy and religious counseling , while praying and meditating every day			1
these treatments , @entity1 claims , have worked and kept him from harming other young girls			2
' since that day in 1994 , i have not had an impulse to act out in any such way			0
' @entity1 has only apologized directly to one of his victims , who he says was ' extraordinary gracious ' , but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be ' opening old wounds '			2

she denies ever turning the audio over to @entity25			0
@entity1 says the release of the tapes in october led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls , and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on @entity8 was a victim			1
