i think they [ other people ] are jealous			0
f * * * the lot of them ! everyone 's entitled to their opinion but everyone 's entitled to a place to live			0
' @entity30 , who receives the equivalent of £ 60,000 a year , is now looking forward to a council - funded renovation of her current home , which will see the two three - bedroom houses she currently occupies knocked together to create a permanent six - bedroom house			2

but , despite the vast expense to taxpayers , who spend a staggering £ 100 million on benefits every day according to @entity201 figures , @entity30 , who has never had a full time job , says the system is put there to help people like her			1
' yes , people do n't agree with the benefits system and s * * * like that but the benefits system is put there to help people that ca n't go out and work , ' she asserts			2
' yes , it 's my choice and my decision to have a large family but there 's no law out there to say how many kids you can have or ca n't have			0
there 's people out there with more kids than me , that 's my argument			0
' she adds : ' @entity232 or someone who murdered someone would n't have got as much s * * * in the press as what i got			0
' you only get what you 're entitled to			0
you know , a weekly shop costs quite a bit , then gas and electric for both houses - it 's all got to come out of it			0
' by the end of the week , you can guarantee you 're skint			2
we ca n't afford to take the kids to @entity249 or on posh holidays			0
' @entity30 says she is looking forward to seeing what kind of response those who do eventually get the £ 500,000 home she almost moved into			2
' are the people who get it going to get as much grief as what i got ? ' she asks			0
' the £ 500,000 house was built for somebody			2
so lets see if they get the s * * * i got for being allocated it			0
