you do n't have to look as skinny as @entity22			0
like @entity23 is okay !

the boy 's parents and his school in @entity45 said they did not expect his letter to receive so much attention			1
his teacher , @entity48 , told @entity49 : ' it was weekend homework , for his @entity3 assignment			1
a letter [ written ] to anyone or anything			2
