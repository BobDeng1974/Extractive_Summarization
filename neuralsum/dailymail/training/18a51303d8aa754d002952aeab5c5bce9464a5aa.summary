shame : the guidance was issued in the wake of the furore over @entity4 , convicted of raping a woman , but who maintains the sex was consensual a row broke out last night over guidelines which would see men accused of date rape being asked to prove that a woman wanted to have sex			1
as part of a major shake - up of investigations into sex offences , the @entity14 said it was vital to remove ‘ any grey area ’ to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent			1
campaigners described the move as a ‘ huge step forward ’ in ensuring fewer rapists escaped justice			2
but critics said the guidelines threatened to undermine @entity32 ’s long - standing principle that people were innocent until proven guilty			1
@entity35 mp @entity34 said : ‘ it is not clear how anyone is supposed to prove that consent was given			1
is the @entity39 really suggesting that you have to get a signed statement off someone before they have sex ? ‘ nobody wants to see rapists walk free			1
i ’m as hardline as they come on crime , but this is ridiculous			0
our legal system is based on people being innocent until proven guilty and the @entity39 are trying to turn that on its head			1
’ @entity55 , the @entity14 , issued the guidance in the wake of the furore over @entity4 , who was released from prison in october halfway through a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old woman in a @entity63 hotel			0
the footballer has always professed his innocence , saying the sex was consensual , but the woman said she was too drunk to agree			2
the guidelines , issued to all police forces and prosecutors , move well beyond the idea of ‘ no means no ’ for the first time			2
they spell out situations where victims would not be in a position to agree to sex , such as if they were incapacitated through alcohol or drugs , had mental health problems or learning difficulties , or were asleep or unconscious			2
rape suspects in positions of power – such as a teacher , employer or doctor – and domestic violence situations where a complainant ‘ may be financially or otherwise ’ dependent on their alleged rapist , should also be scrutinised , the @entity39 said			1
the document also made clear that behaviour such as staying silent or using contraception did not signify consent			0
the guidance tells police officers and lawyers to ask how the suspect knew the alleged victim had consented to sex ‘ with full capacity and freedom to do so ’			1
investigators have been told to put greater emphasis on an accused man demonstrating that he had obtained the woman ’s agreement ‘ fully and freely ’			0
@entity55 , the @entity14 , left , said it was vital to recognise situations where a woman may have been unable to give consent			0
but @entity35 mp @entity34 , right , said it was n't clear how proof of consent could work in august last year a leading female judge provoked controversy by criticising rape victims who drank too much and were unable to remember their attack clearly			1
judge @entity120 said : ‘ i ’m not saying it ’s right to rape a drunken woman , i ’m not saying for a moment that it ’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman			0
‘ but a jury in a position where they ’ve got a woman who says , “ i was absolutely off my head , i ca n’t really remember what i was doing , i ca n’t remember what i said , i ca n’t remember if i consented or not but i know i would n’t have done ” – when a jury is faced with something like that , how are they supposed to react ? ’ mrs @entity55 said : ‘ consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely			0
‘ we want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue : how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly ? ’ @entity147 , director of the @entity148 , said : ‘ the guidance is a huge step forward			0
it will help ensure that juries are asked to look in detail at the behaviour of defendants as well as at that of the complainant			0
’ but @entity157 , director of the @entity159 think - tank , warned : ‘ the burden of proof should always be on the prosecution and we should never relax that requirement			0

new guidelines would force alleged rapists to prove consent was given
but critics warn it undermines principle of innocent until proven guilty
