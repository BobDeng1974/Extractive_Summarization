a government inquiry is to be carried out into the impact of migrant children arriving in schools unable to speak @entity4			1
education secretary @entity5 revealed she has ordered officials to start ' mapping the pressures ' on the state schools system			1
it comes less than six months after she told the head of @entity13 it was not ' helpful ' to warn that schools are struggling to cope with an ' influx ' of migrants			1
education secretary @entity5 revealed she has ordered officials to start ' mapping the pressures ' on the state schools system caused by immigration immigration has played a low - key role in the @entity26 election campaign to date , after @entity27 spectacularly to meet his pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands			1
the @entity26 leader vowed to cut the number below 100,000 ' no ifs , no buts ' , but latest figures show the number hit 298,000 in the year to september			1
in an interview today mrs @entity37 admitted it is a ' big issue ' for voters and revealed she has asked the @entity41 to examine the impact on schools			1
it is expected to look at how migrant children perform in exams and how schools with large immigrant populations cope			1
mrs @entity37 told the @entity49 : ' i think there is pressure in the classrooms in terms of teaching — how prepared [ immigrant ] children are when they start school			1
@entity13 chief inspector sir @entity60 last year warned schools had faced an ' influx ' of immigrants ' it would be wrong to say immigration holds results back or affects overall qualifications ultimately			1
but at the start of primary school , especially , it means that teachers have to tailor their lessons , to spend longer with pupils who have @entity4 as a second language			1
' we are looking at that in the @entity41 — exactly mapping the pressures , what teachers have to do , the resources that takes			1
i am very keen to know			2
' she added that she wanted to ensure that migrant children have caught up with other pupils before the end of the @entity84 , aged six or seven			1
in october last year , @entity13 chief inspector sir @entity60 was challenged about the increased worked of teachers caused by a large number of children who could not speak @entity4			1
sir @entity60 said : ' schools need the resources to deal with that			1
' when they 're faced with an influx of children from other countries , they need the resources and capacity to deal with it , and if those resources are n't there , that 's a big issue for government			1
that 's the first thing and we 'll be producing reports on this fairly soon			2
' net long - term migration to the @entity106 was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier but a week later mrs @entity37 questioned sir @entity60 's language and played down the scale of the problem			1
' obviously sir @entity60 has gone round to various schools but no , when i go round schools i see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad			1
' i am not sure that sort of language is always helpful but there are challenges and there are parts of the country where we know that there are higher numbers of students who do n't speak @entity4 as a first language			2
' asked whether sir @entity60 should have chosen his words more carefully , mrs @entity37 added : ' this whole area of immigration is an area where we need to be very careful about the language that we use			2
' it is n't that it is n't a concern to people because it absolutely is but we also need to think about the language and the tone of the debate that we use			2
' we need to tackle the issue in a sensitive way without saying there is n't a problem because people are clearly concerned about it			2
' everyone who comes to @entity106 should know how to speak @entity4 , @entity148 @entity147 has warned as he admitted @entity148 made mistakes on immigration			1
the @entity148 leader admitted that in the past his party had been ' too timid ' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language			0
but the @entity26 said there was nothing in mr @entity147 's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to @entity106 , after net migration hit 298,000 in a year			2
@entity147 admitted that in the past his party had been ' too timid ' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language mr @entity147 pledged a new crackdown on illegal exploitation of migrant workers , promising a @entity168 task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers			2
speaking in @entity172 - a marginal seat held by the @entity26 employment minister @entity174 - the @entity148 leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for @entity106 workers			0
his new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the @entity182 and specialist police units , together with additional @entity168 enforcement staff			0
the unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules			0
but he also warned that migrants must learn to speak @entity4 , especially in key services like the @entity195			2
mr @entity147 said : ' our communities are changing fast but we do n't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds			0
instead we must find a way to live together across communities			0
' a @entity106 where people of all backgrounds , all cultures , all religions , can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity			0
' but we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language			0
' he said his own parents had learned to speak @entity4 after arriving from @entity215 in 1940			0
' it is why i believe in a simple principle : everyone in @entity106 should know how to speak @entity4			0
' sometimes , we 've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here			0
' and it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak @entity4			0
' he said that ' nowhere is that more true ' than in the health service			0
' we all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our @entity195			0
doctors , paramedics , social workers , nurses			0
bringing specialist skills that we need			0
' i will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country			0
' but it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles do n't just have the right medical skills , but can communicate with those for whom they care			0
' so in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak @entity4 to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients			0
