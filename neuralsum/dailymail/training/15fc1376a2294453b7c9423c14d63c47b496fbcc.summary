@entity15 , 40 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , was arrested on monday on preliminary charges of causing suicide and neglect in the death of her son , @entity6 , who died of an overdose of prescription medication			1
according to a probable cause affidavit , @entity24 found her son , @entity6 , unresponsive on a couch in their home on july 10 after suspecting he had stolen her prescription pulls			1
she did not seek medical help			1
he died the next day , and his death was ruled a suicide attributed to high levels of prescription medications			0
she has not yet been formally charged but was being held without bond tuesday at the @entity39			0
relatives told police that @entity24 was a morphine addict and her son ' was in great duress ' from confronting her over her addiction and his fear that she might overdose , the affidavit says			1
@entity24 threatened to kill himself in january , the affidavit states , but @entity24 told officers she ignored medical advice to sign him into a treatment center because he ' did n't want to go			1
@entity63 , an @entity64 law professor , said she ca n't recall any prosecutions for causing suicide in her more than 30 years of practicing law in @entity17			2
as written , the law applies to ' a person who intentionally causes another human being , by force , duress , or deception , to commit suicide			1
' @entity63 said that means prosecutors would have to prove @entity24 intentionally caused her son 's death			1
' they have to show that by duress she intended to bring about his suicide as opposed to failing to get him medical care when she should have reasonably assumed that he had ingested her medication , ' @entity63 said			2
' that 's what intentionally means under @entity17 law - that her intent was to bring about a specific result			0
' similar charges have been rejected by courts over the last decade			0
in 2006 , the @entity91 overturned the conviction of a @entity94 woman who prosecutors said kept such a messy home that it endangered her 12 - year - old son 's safety and mental health			0
the boy , @entity100 , killed himself in 2002 , and the case sparked a national debate over what responsibility a parent holds for a child 's suicide			2
concerned : family of the teen say he was depressed over his mother 's drug use and her reluctance to quit that drove him to also attempt suicide in january the court in the @entity117 case found prosecutors could n't identify objective standards to determine when a messy house becomes a risk to a child 's mental health			1
in @entity24 's case , prosecutors may still be weighing whether to proceed with the causing suicide charge , @entity63 said			2
messages left for the @entity39 prosecutor were n't immediately returned tuesday			0
jail records listed no attorney for @entity24			2
according to the probable cause affidavit , @entity24 told officers on july 10 that she thought her son had taken her pills - including 30 @entity136 and 26 @entity137 - when she found him on the couch			1
in an interview with police days later , she said she confronted her son about 8.30 am on july 10 about drugs that were missing			1
she said he denied taking them but she suspected otherwise because he had slow speech and was ' groggy acting			0
' ignored : hours before his death the mother said she confronted her son on her couch about taking her pills and though he denied it she told police he appeared groggy ' @entity2 even told @entity6 that what he consumed could kill him , ' the affidavit says			1
but @entity24 allegedly did not seek medical help for her son			1
she told police she instead checked on him periodically during the day as he slept on a couch to make sure ' he was still breathing			0
' @entity24 called 911 about eight hours later , at 4.45 pm , after she checked on @entity6 and found him not breathing and with a grayish / white skin color			2
according to the affidavit , @entity24 told officers that she was a former intravenous morphine abuser			0
but officers said in the document they noticed what appeared to be ' fresh track marks on her left wrist / hand area ' and relatives told them ' she is still using			0
' a relative who answered the telephone on tuesday at @entity24 's parents ' home said the family has been devastated by the charges and did not want to speak to media			0
@entity177 , a spokesman for @entity17 's @entity178 , said the agency had contact with @entity24 's family ' recently			0
' but she said she could not comment further because of state and federal confidentiality laws			0
