@entity2 cleaners and @entity4 manual workers are among new suspects in the @entity7 investigation , @entity0 has learned			1
@entity8 identified what they describe as ‘ people of interest ’ during a review of the @entity4 inquiry into the three - year - old ’s disappearance in may , 2007			1
the suspects are thought to number 12 – not 20 as has been reported – and include a number of @entity2 cleaners who were working near the apartment complex where @entity23 , twin siblings @entity21 and @entity24 and parents @entity25 and @entity27 were staying			1
detectives are believed to be investigating whether a couple comforted a crying @entity7 sources said ‘ low - level ’ workers – handymen , cleaners and gardeners – have become the focus of interest			1
some are thought to have been employed by the @entity40 complex on a casual basis and may have already been interviewed			2
police are said to be keen to trace six @entity2 cleaners who were working in @entity45 when @entity23 vanished and who did n’t appear in the @entity4 files			1
they are said to have used a white van and went from apartment to apartment offering their services , chiefly concentrating on expats			0
@entity55 and @entity56 hold their twins @entity21 and @entity24 at the @entity59 in 2007 the @entity40 in @entity45 where @entity60 disappeared			0
@entity4 police refuse to reopen the case a source said : ‘ there is quite a culture of people drifting from door to door offering services from everything from your garden to your roof or windows			2
’ as well as the manual workers there are a number of more obvious suspects who already appear in the @entity4 files but who @entity2 police feel have n’t been ‘ bottomed out ’ properly and therefore warrant further investigation			1
‘ there are a lot of people who could be explored further , if only to be eliminated , ’ said detective chief superintendent @entity81 , head of @entity8 ’s @entity82			1
however officers face having to break down @entity4 resistance to re-opening the inquiry			2
officials in @entity90 say they can reopen the case only if there is new evidence			0
but it has been claimed that the new leads could , if properly explored , result in new evidence and possibly solve the @entity23 mystery			0
@entity23 disappeared in 2007 when she was on holiday with her parents and brother and sister in @entity4 @entity27 and @entity55 have never given up hunting for their daughter detectives examining the @entity4 files were alarmed that the original inquiry had not traced and interviewed all the staff and holidaymakers who were at the @entity40 when @entity23 went missing			2
last year the @entity108 said that it had identified 195 fresh leads that should have been investigated either by conducting further witness interviews , eliminating suspects or carrying out forensic tests that were missing from the 2007 inquiry			2
officers found unexplained gaps in the investigation timeline and that there had been a complete lack of forensic examination of mobile phone activity in the area on the night @entity23 disappeared			0

@entity2 officers face difficulty in breaking down resistance in @entity4 to reopening the case @entity7 is seen how she may look as her ninth birthday approached in this computer - generated handout photograph released in 2012 mr @entity81 said it was ‘ perfectly probable ’ that information which could identify the suspect responsible for @entity23 ’s disappearance was already in the @entity4 files			1
he reiterated a claim that @entity23 could still be alive			0
he said : ‘ you only have to look at the case in @entity139 , @entity140 , and the @entity142 cases			0
of course there is a possibility she is alive			0
but the key is to investigate the case and , alive or dead , we should be able to try and discern what happened			0
’ the @entity150 , of @entity151 , @entity152 , have been kept closely informed of @entity8 ’s review – codenamed @entity154 – over the past two years			1
a spokesman for the couple said : ‘ they have been encouraged from the moment the review started and are now greatly encouraged that police have drawn up a short list of people who they believe are of interest to the inquiry			1
