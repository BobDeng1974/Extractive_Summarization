a woman left heartbroken by seven miscarriages has finally achieved her dream of becoming a mother - thanks to a stitch in her cervix and daily doses of aspirin			1
@entity8 had spent a traumatic 12 years trying to start a family since meeting her husband , @entity10 , in 2003			2
the 33 - year - old initially became pregnant after two years , but was devastated when she lost the baby - whom she had named after her grandfather @entity13 - at just 22 weeks			1
over the next decade she suffered another five miscarriages and almost gave up hope of ever having a child			2
@entity8 , 33 , suffered seven miscarriages and she and her husband @entity10 , 35 , nearly gave up on ever having a child			1
on december 3 2014 she gave birth to @entity19 - thanks to a stitch in her cervix mrs @entity8 said @entity19 had a personality straight away			1
she said : ' he likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and does n't like going down in his bed ' she was diagnosed with @entity29 syndrome , which causes an increased risk of blood clots and raises the risk of miscarriage in pregnant women			1
doctors said the condition – which causes the blood to be ' too sticky ' - could be causing her recurring miscarriages			1
they prescribed aspirin , which helps thin the blood , and another drug called @entity42 which stops blood clots forming			1
last march mrs @entity8 became pregnant for a seventh time and was delighted when doctors told her she would be having twins			1
but she lost one of the babies at just nine weeks , and she and her husband @entity10 , 35 , feared the other child would not survive			2
however , doctors inserted a stitch into her cervix , which stops it opening too early , reducing the chance of a miscarriage			1
on december 3 mrs @entity8 gave birth to @entity19 four weeks early by emergency caesarean section			1
mrs @entity8 , from @entity57 , @entity58 , said : ' it 's been a long time coming but nothing prepares you for being a mum			2
' it 's a lot harder than i thought it would be and i 'm always tired			0
' but it 's really exciting , watching every stage he goes through			0
just seeing him every day is amazing			0
' i never felt safe during the pregnancy			0
' everyone was getting really excited but right up until the point i was holding him i thought it was going to go wrong			0
' mrs @entity8 , who runs a craft company , added : ' @entity19 had a personality pretty much straight away			1
a cervical stitch is also known as a cervical suture or cervical cerclage			0
it involves ' stitching ' a tape around the cervix to support it			0
this aims to keep the cervix closed and therefore to help prevent a baby being born too early			1
doctors might advise a cervical stitch because they believe the woman has a weakness in the cervix – they call this ‘ cervical incompetence ’			1
this means the cervix runs the risk of opening before the end of a 40 - week pregnancy , and maybe even very early on in pregnancy			1
if the cervix opens , there is an increased risk of the baby being born early and not surviving , or surviving with a serious risk of long - term problems			1
source : @entity106 ' he likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and does n't like going down in his bed			0
' he can be fast asleep in your arms and as soon as you put him down he 's wide awake			0
he also loves being in the bath			0
' @entity19 was born at @entity117 in @entity118 weighing 5lb14oz - but mrs @entity8 still had worries right to the last minute			1
during her pregnancy , mrs @entity8 had suffered from gestational diabetes – a condition affecting pregnant women where there is too much glucose in the blood - and had to go on a strict low sugar diet			1
then , one morning she woke up to discover she had been bleeding overnight and dialled 999 in tears			0
she told the operator she thought she had lost another baby and was rushed to hospital , where doctors performed an emergency caesarean immediately			1
when @entity19 was born , mrs @entity8 said his first cry sounded ' amazing '			1
she believes her son 's twin , whom she lost at nine weeks old , may actually have helped @entity19 to survive			2
the twin was absorbed into the womb rather than being miscarried in the normal way , a condition known as a ' vanishing twin ' which sometimes occurs when more than one baby develops in the womb			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' @entity19 was always on one side of my tummy to begin with but when his twin died he moved over to where they had been			1
' i think he was looking for him or her			0
the sibling was a vanishing twin , i never miscarried , it was reabsorbed into the womb			0
' i believe that second twin meant there were extra hormones from that brief little life to help keep the other going			0
' research suggests that vanishing twin syndrome occurs in roughly a third of pregnancies in which an early ultrasound detects two or more developing babies			2
after years of heartbreak , mrs @entity8 and her husband are delighted to be parents			2
mrs @entity8 said : ' we are over the moon with @entity19 , he really is a miracle and i adore him			1
' while mrs @entity8 says she is thrilled to finally be a mother , she currently has no plans to try for another baby			2
' people keep saying now we 've done it once we could do it again			0
' but i would have to have to have that exact combination of hormones , supplements and diets - and even then it might not happen , ' she said			0
' it puts a strain on your body and doctors have said it might be dangerous for me to have another child			0
' we are over the moon with @entity19 , he really is a miracle and i adore him			2
' experts say just one per cent of couples suffer three or more miscarriages , so mrs @entity8 's success after seven was remarkable			2
@entity196 , national director of the @entity106 , said : ' @entity198 miscarriages are horribly common and one in four women will have at least one			0
' it is a far smaller group that have one after another , after another			0
it is only one per cent of couples trying to conceive who will have three or more			0
' she added : ' when it happens again and again it becomes really hard to bear - for more than half of those people they will never find out why they are miscarrying			0
' some couples will keep trying and some of them just feel like they need to stop because they ca n't cope anymore			0
' i am really happy to hear @entity8 has had success but i 'm sure that it wo n't stop her feeling the grief for the babies that she has lost			1
