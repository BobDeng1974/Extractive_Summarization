by @entity0 most women wear perfume to mask their body odor , but one artist is making waves for doing exactly the opposite			0
@entity8 - @entity7 launched a fragrance called @entity10 , which is crafted using the ' aromatic elements from her body ' - namely her sweat , tears and hair			1
the unusual scent debuted in the may issue of @entity19 , with a description calling it ' unique and intensely addictive ' as well as ' wet , sweet and sensual like a hot , humid summer day			0
' au naturel : @entity8 - based artist @entity23 has debuted a fragrance called @entity10 , which is crafted using the ' aromatic elements from her body ' - namely her sweat , tears and hair the former model 's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same t - shirt for five nights , or by doing @entity33 yoga and then putting her shirt in a sterile mason jar			1
to elicit and then bottle her tears , she watched films and cartoons that reminded her of her childhood in communist @entity40			1
according to her website , @entity23 spent a year working with a research team of @entity44 chemistry students , who helped create an ' olfactory - based self - portrait ' based on the scents she produced			1
we asked a selection of @entity51 employees what they thought of the fragrance			0
( the women knew what it was , and the men did not			0
) here 's what the women had to say ... it 's that smell of a girl 's t - shirt when her deodorant almost but does n't quite completely mask the sweat smell			1
it smells tangy , like sweat on a summer 's day			1
and the men said ... to extract her scents , the students - overseen by professor @entity71 - used a complex process of treating 100per cent cotton clothes that she had worn , then washing the clothes with ethanol and leaving it to evaporate			2
' any water in the sweat samples allows for bacteria to grow , ' dr @entity71 explained to the @entity81			2
' that 's what gives rise to the body odor that everybody associates with sweat or the scent of the human body			1
' the process left behind just the aromatic essential oils , which were then delivered to scent director @entity92 and perfumer @entity93 so they could reconstruct her natural aroma			0
the elements they ultimately chose were tropical coconut infused with cacao absolute , fresh grass and passionfruit - abnormally fresh human scents that are likely linked to the fact that she is a vegan			2
' the analysis of the exact odor ... there were a lot of materials that are not available in the perfumist 's palette			2
so you have to recreate it with lots of pieces from [ different elements ] , ' mr @entity93 told vice			0
' we tried a musky smell , a milky smell , a sweaty fruity smell			0
it 's hard to recreate the exact molecules of her body			2
' creative process : the former model 's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same t - shirt for five nights and by doing @entity33 yoga			1
to elicit tears , she watched films from her childhood in communist @entity40 @entity19 readers likely did n't even look twice at the page in the magazine , which looked like any other fragrance ad , with a nude portrait of the artist and a photo of a perfume bottle			1
and that 's exactly what @entity23 intended , as she explains in her artist 's statement about the work			1
have a whiff : a scent strip of the unusual ' perfume ' was featured in the may issue of @entity19 ( pictured ) ' by running a fake advertisement with a scent strip in the full print run of @entity19 ( circulation 950,000 ) magazine , i will be expanding the self - portrait beyond the traditional art context by performing olfactory guerrilla tactic , ' she wrote			2
' the advertisement will become a vehicle for spreading my essence across the country , letting the mass market consume artwork unwittingly			0
' she added that the fragrance and its production has a special significance			0
' the piece represents the true essence of a woman - free of visual prejudice , ' she explained			0
in an interview with @entity177 , @entity175 explains the logic behind using smell as an artistic medium			0
' [ it 's ] the perfect medium to experience something viscerally because there is nothing else but feeling , ' she said			0
' you 're literally just inhaling through your nose , and it 's going directly to your brain and creating feelings and memories - it 's purely primal			1

@entity23 's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same t - shirt for five nights , or by doing @entity33 yoga
she also *collected* the tears she cried while watching films and cartoons that reminded her of her childhood in communist @entity40
