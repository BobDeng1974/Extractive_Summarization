around 66 million years ago , a six mile - wide asteroid smashed into the @entity1 off @entity4 's @entity3 peninsular			1
the impact wiped out three quarters of all plant and animal species - including the dinosaurs - triggering mega-tsunami , wildfires , global earthquakes			1
but even @entity13 can have a silver lining , according to a new discovery which claims the event proved a turning point for the plants that now dominate vegetation on @entity1			0
after the impact , fast - growing seasonal species of plants began to take over from evergreens			1
this is according to a study of 1,000 fossilised plant leaves in @entity27 by the @entity28 after the impact , fast - growing seasonal species of plants rapidly began to take over from evergreens			1
' if you think about a mass extinction caused by catastrophic event such as a meteorite impacting @entity1 , you might imagine all species are equally likely to die , ' said lead scientist dr @entity35 , from the @entity28			2
' @entity36 does n't apply - the impact is like a reset button			2
' the alternative hypothesis , however , is that some species had properties that enabled them to survive			0
analysis of the leaf samples revealed the switch from evergreens to deciduous plants after the meteor struck all the fossils were collected from a rock formation known as @entity51 that marks the site of an ancient flood plain in the south of @entity27 dr @entity35 's study provides evidence of a dramatic shift from slow - growing plants to fast - growing species			1
he said it potentially tells scientists why modern forests are generally made up of seasonal plants and not evergreen			1
a devastating ' impact winter ' , brought on by an asteroid strike 66 million years ago , is being blamed for wiping out the dinosaurs			0
researchers have discovered the first physical evidence that global temperatures suddenly plummeted following the impact off @entity4 's @entity72			2
its effects would have been identical to those seen in the aftermath of a large - scale nuclear war , including the chilling effect of dust blotting out of the sun. according to the research , the ' @entity82 ' impact is likely to have brought about this ' nuclear winter ' by lowering global sea surface temperatures by as much as @entity86 ( 45 ° f ) at a conservative estimate			2
for creatures evolved to live in a lush , warm , green world , the result would have been catastrophic			0
the ' winter ' is thought to have lasted no more than two to three decades , but that was long enough to wipe out the dinosaurs , flying and swimming reptiles , and many other forms of life			0
only the most adaptable survived , leading to the reign of the birds and mammals that continues to this day			0
deciduous plants , which grow fast and lose their leaves at some point during the year , were better able to survive the changing conditions of an impact winter , the researchers believe			1
evergreen plants , such as holly , tend to have leaves that are costly to construct but robust and long - lasting			1
leaves of deciduous plants are short lived and more cheaply built , but easier to replace			2
' there is a spectrum between fast and slow - growing species , ' said dr @entity35			1
' there is the ' live fast , die young ' strategy and there is the " slow but steady " strategy			0
' the discovery , reported in the online journal @entity120 , followed a study of around 1,000 fossilised plant leaves dating back to a 2.2 million - year period spanning the impact event			1
all the fossils were collected from a rock formation known as @entity51 that marks the site of an ancient flood plain in the south of @entity27			0
analysis of the leaf samples revealed the switch from evergreens to deciduous plants after the meteor struck			1
' we measured the mass of a given leaf in relation to its area , which tells us whether the leaf was a chunky , expensive one to make for the plant , or whether it was a more flimsy , cheap one , ' said dr @entity35			2
' in other words , how much carbon the plant had invested in the leaf			0
' the scientists also measured the density of the leaves ' vein networks , which gave a clue to their transpiration rate - the speed at which they drew water			0
' [ the study ] tells us that the extinction was not random , and the way in which a plant acquires resources predicts how it can respond to a major disturbance , ' said dr @entity35			0
around 66 million years ago , a six mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid smashed into the @entity1 off @entity4 's @entity3 peninsular			0
the impact wiped out three quarters of all plant and animal species - including the dinosaurs - triggering mega-tsunami , wildfires , global earthquakes			1

after impact , fast - growing species of plants replaced many evergreens
this is according to study of 1,000 fossilised leaves in @entity27
mass of each leaf revealed whether it came from a seasonal plant
it *explains* why today 's forests are mostly made up of fast - growing plants
