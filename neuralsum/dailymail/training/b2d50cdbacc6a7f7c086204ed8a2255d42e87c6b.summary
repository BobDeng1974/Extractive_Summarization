by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:22 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 18:51 est , 25 july 2012 @entity2 infuriated @entity4 colleagues and environmental groups yesterday by refusing to sign up to carbon emissions targets and insisting on a new ‘ dash for gas ’			1
the chancellor is understood to be determined not to commit @entity10 to tough climate targets beyond 2020 , arguing they will be a disadvantage for businesses			1
the @entity15 resisted calls for deep cuts to onshore wind subsidies , announcing yesterday a reduction of 10 per cent in payments for new turbines			1
power : government subsidies for wind turbines are to be cut by 10 per cent as @entity2 refuses to sign up for new carbon emissions targets but green groups reacted angrily as the government ’s energy strategy endorsed support for future gas power in a compromise between the @entity4 - led department and mr @entity2			1
significantly , sources said the chancellor and prime minister were determined to block ‘ decarbonisation ’ targets after 2020			1
one @entity39 source said : ‘ the official line is the government is reserving its position , but @entity2 and @entity43 have made clear they object to post- 2020 targets , which suggests the government will never agree to any			2
’ ministers also announced yesterday that @entity46 subsidies for wind turbines are to be cut by ten per cent and planning rules that regulate their construction reviewed			1
the chancellor had been pushing for even steeper cuts - but agreed to accept @entity4 energy secretary @entity4 ’s proposal for an initial ten per cent reduction , followed by a further review next year			1
@entity58 : mr @entity2 is understood to be determined not to commit @entity10 to tough new climate targets beyond 2020 in exchange , the @entity4 have agreed that gas - fired power stations will be a key part of @entity10 ’s energy production well into the 2030s , despite the objections of climate change campaigners			1
the government will commit to introducing a ‘ simple and stable regulatory regime ’ to allow domestic shale gas development , using the controversial process of ‘ fracking ’			2
gas deposits trapped underground are extracted by fracturing shale rock with blasts of water , sand and chemicals - a process that has been accused of causing small earthquakes near sites			0
but it is the chancellor ’s determination to block new climate targets beyond 2020 that will cause most controversy			1
a report from @entity86 today insists @entity10 and the rest of @entity88 should sign up to even stricter emissions targets to boost green energy			2
they recommend the @entity92 cuts carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 - instead of the current 20 per cent which they claim is ‘ not ambitious or challenging ’			2
the @entity96 says that despite opposition from the @entity99 and @entity100 to legally - binding caps on emissions , @entity88 should ‘ show leadership ’ on climate change			0
the @entity86 ’ report claims increasing carbon targets would put pressure on the world ’s biggest emitters to make similar commitments			0
at a @entity112 climate conference in @entity113 last december , world leaders agreed a ‘ road map ’ for all major countries - including developing countries - to introduce targets to tackle global warming for the first time			2
however the @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity120 - which make up around half of global emissions - will only have to start cutting them from 2020 and it is unclear how stringent or binding the targets will be			2
@entity126 , the @entity126 mp who chairs the @entity96 said : ‘ @entity88 can be proud of the leadership it has shown on climate change			0
it must now show that leadership again by setting a more ambitious goal to bolster the chances of a new agreement being reached in 2015			0
‘ that needs to be the year an agreement is reached to give the world a fighting chance of keeping temperatures below dangerous levels			0
' the @entity92 ’s current 20 per cent carbon reduction target by 2020 is no longer sufficiently ambitious or challenging and will easily be reached because of the recession			0
’ supply and demand : ministers have agreed that gas - fired power stations will be a key part of @entity10 's energy production well into the 2030s the committee suggests @entity10 should commit to around 42 per cent cuts in emissions on 1990 levels , through a new generation of wind turbines , solar panels and nuclear power			1
but manufacturers ’ groups warned that high energy costs due to climate policies were already putting thousands of industrial jobs at risk			0
the @entity162 , representing around 800,000 people in industries such as steel , cement and chemicals , is calling for tax relief on energy costs for its members to avoid job losses			0
its chairman @entity172 said : ‘ we all want to see a greener societ , but we ca n’t do this with one hand tied behind our backs			0
’ @entity178 , executive director of @entity179 , said : ‘ the @entity180 has sunk to pretty low depths now it has turned real @entity10 opportunities for green growth and jobs into an unedifying inter-department squabble			0

chancellor determined not to to commit @entity10 to climate targets beyond 2020
ministers to announce 10 per cent cut in wind farm subsidies and a review of planning rules
@entity4 agree gas - fired power stations will be key part of @entity10 's energy production well into 2030s
