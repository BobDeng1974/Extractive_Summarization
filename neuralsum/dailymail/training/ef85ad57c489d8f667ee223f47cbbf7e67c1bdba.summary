when @entity1 and boyfriend @entity2 went to see @entity3 the dinosaur at the @entity5 they decided the perfect way to enjoy the experience would be to dress up as animals themselves			1
the teenage couple from @entity11 in @entity12 donned dinosaur and @entity15 onesies for the visit to the @entity18 museum			1
but they were soon deterred from making an exhibition of themselves and were told they would have to change before they were allowed in			2
@entity24 told @entity25 , 17 and mr @entity2 , 18 , to remove the costumes as they made their way into the museum because they visitors in fancy dress had caused problems in the past			1
@entity1 ( left ) and boyfriend @entity2 were told to remove their @entity15 and dinosaur onesies when they visited the @entity5 in @entity18 and were told they would need to be stored in bags the pair were forced to remove their onesies and store them in bags , which staff then insisted on searching to check nothing was concealed inside the outfits			1
' we got pulled aside in front of everyone first , then they told us we had to take them off , ' miss @entity1 said			2
' luckily we had clothes on underneath but a lot of people do n't			0
' they said it was classed as a costume and we could n't wear that in the museum			0
we said , no it was pyjamas , you sell them yourselves			0
' they were insistent it was a costume and asked if we were celebrating someone 's birthday which was why we were wearing them			0
' both said they decided to wear onesies - miss @entity1 wearing a onesie depicting @entity15 character @entity69 - for the college trip after they were told to wear something comfortable			1
the teenage couple had planned to visit the museum 's famous @entity3 the dinosaur exhibit in the @entity75 both claimed they had worn the costumes for comfort and did not understand why they were asked to change they travelled to @entity18 , by train , without any questions and made their way to the museum , in @entity84 , in december			1
miss @entity1 said she also found having to have their bags searched in front of everyone humiliating			1
the pair 's onesies were later stored behind a desk she added : ' they made us stand there , in front of everyone , we felt like we have done something really , really wrong			2
' then they took our onesies from us and put them behind the desk , giving us this ticket we could use to collect them when we were done at the museum at the end of the day			2
' all for an item of clothing which they sell in their own shop			0
' it was very strange , they did n't have any signs , i checked the website when i got back to see if i 'd missed something			0
' there was nothing about any other forms of clothing on , it just said you could take anything as long as it was not threatening			0
' a spokesman for the museum said there was no particular dress code for entry to the museum , but the duty manager has responsibility for deciding who is allowed inside			0
he said : ' we have in the past had visitors in costumes cause disturbances in the building , which affected other people 's experience at the museum			0
