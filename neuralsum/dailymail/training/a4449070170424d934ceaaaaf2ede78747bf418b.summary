and if you 're ready to splash out how will you decide which one to go for ? the two hottest brands on the market right now are undoubtedly the @entity16 and the @entity18 , both designed to pulverise fruit and vegetables and create easy , health - filled drinks ( among other things )			1
there 's a lot of chat about which is the best buy and while the @entity18 's £ 400 price tag will rule some of you out straight away , for those of you with the cash to spend i 've pitted the two against each other in a @entity46 to see what the big deal is			0
@entity14 put the blenders through their paces testing five different recipes to see which produced the best result i use the £ 100 @entity16 ( @entity55 to be technical )			1
my husband @entity19 prefers his @entity57 aka the @entity18			1
i know , such gross @entity58			0
our flat is too small for a dining table but we have two super blenders fighting for space in the kitchen			1
at least this means we know our stuff when it comes to juicing			0
like most people i know , we mostly use blenders to make smoothies and juices			1
they are generally a fuss - free way to get fruit and vegetables , and therefore lots of health , into your diet			1
but there are several tricky areas that can be deal breakers when it comes to a smoothie blender			0
i tested them both against some immense kitchen challenges like : kiwis ( ooh ) , ginger ( aah ) , celery ( eeh ) , carrots ( oh no you did n't ) and even nuts ( i ca n't even ! )			1
here 's how they got on ... juice wars : results of the @entity95 test for the @entity16 ( left ) and the @entity18 ( right ) @entity96 : @entity95 a green smoothie is the best way to get as much goodness as possible from your blender			1
i used a simple recipe - apple / kiwi / kale / cucumber / almonds / sunflower seeds / chia seeds - leaving all skin / stalks attached and adding seeds as recommended by both brands			1
result : the @entity18 bust up the nuts , seeds and skin within seconds and delivered a smooth and creamy drink ( see picture above )			1
given the same time the @entity16 could n't quite pulverise everything , hence the darker colour and more bits on show , which makes for a more lumpy drinking experiece			2
after giving it another 10 - 15 seconds the consistency improved a lot			2
it still was n't quite as smooth as the @entity18 version but both were totally delicious and very drinkable			2
winner : the @entity18 , ( just ) although both the drinks looked virtually identical the @entity16 was unable to blend the ingredients to the same extent as the @entity18 test two : @entity132 these two ingredients are brimming with good stuff and are included in lots of healthy drinks recipes			1
they are both very fibrous though , creating lumpy , stringy drinks if not dealt with properly			0
i added one carrot , several nubs of ginger and 100ml water to each blender to see what happened			0
result : in the glass the ' drinks ' look much the same but the @entity16 was n't able to liquify the carrot and ginger half as well as the @entity18 , as illustrated in the empty glasses			2
there was lots of stringy stuff left behind			0
and nobody wants a mouthful of stringy stuff			0
lots more water and further blitzing reduced the amount of stringy stuff , but not completely			0
winner : the @entity18 what lies beneath : the empty @entity16 glass , left , features lots of pulp test three : nut milk a nice alternative to dairy and soy , nut milks like almond , cashew and hazelnut are a big deal to smoothie fiends			1
they offer protein , vitamins , good fats and a bit of calcium , plus they are low in calories			2
you can buy them ready made in most supermarkets now but most of them have added sugar , and it 's a lot cheaper to make your own on demand			0
i added one cup of cashews and one cup of water to each blender and blitzed for 10 seconds			0
result : a light , frothy milk in seconds from both of them			2
winner : a draw both the @entity16 ( left ) and the @entity18 ( right ) produced an equally frothy milk in seconds test four : @entity210 eating the skin of these furry little fruits might be a bit of a weird concept , but it actually triples the fruit 's fibre content and adds extra @entity218 to the drink			1
in a standard blender the skin is pretty hard to squish , but what happened when i added 100ml water and one kiwi to each of these bad boys ? result : the fruit did n't even touch the sides in the @entity18 , it was pulverised into a green / brown liquid within 10 seconds			1
in the @entity16 , one long blitz delivered a green , slightly furry sludge , but another 15 - 20 seconds and the result was almost a perfect match for the @entity18 's juice			1
winner ? a draw ( assuming you have those extra 20 seconds to spare ) @entity14 put the blenders through their paces when it came to breaking down kiwi skin test five : hummus both blenders claim to make dips as well as drinks , and being able to create an instant homemade hummus is a nice party trick			1
i added tinned chick peas , sesame seeds , lemon juice , olive oil , garlic ( peeled ) and salt to both			1
result : the @entity18 was not happy to start with , despite me following the recipe straight from the @entity18 site			0
i 've learned that this hungry blender requires a bit more lubrication to get things going , but once i had added a splash more chickpea liquid from the tin it created a smooth , great - tasting dip in seconds			1
this is where the @entity18 's multi-speed settings came into their own			0
@entity273 do n't run the motor for too long or the dip will become too thin			2
the @entity16 created a dip with a nice texture but the ingredients did n't blend thoroughly enough and so it tasted very strongly of raw garlic			2
winner ? @entity18 before and after : no mess hummus in the @entity18 ( top ) and the @entity16 ( bottom ) verdict ... the overall winner in the five tests was easily the @entity18 , a super blender that takes no prisoners and could probably atomize a car engine if you were so inclined			2
the different settings mean that it can heat ingredients into a soup , or freeze them into ice cream so it 's very versatile and the size of the jug means it 's great for families or small businesses			0
but considering there is a £ 300 price difference , the @entity16 did n't fair so badly			0
it 's definitely leagues above your average kitchen blender			0
it 's a bit like comparing a @entity303 to an @entity304 - they 'll both get you somewhere but the results are going to be a little different			0
yes the @entity16 drinks were n't quite as smooth , but considering the skin , pips , pith and stalks that they contained they were very drinkable , and almost on a par with the @entity18 once they were whizzed for a bit longer			0
other pluses include the slimline size , and the to - go aspect ( the drinks are blended directly into the cup so you just pop the top on and go once you 're done )			0
if you 're a serious chef with money to burn the @entity18 is the one for you			0
but if you do n't care about making ice - cream / soup / hummus / the neighbours jealous , and just want to enjoy some healthy smoothies then there 's no need to splash the cash , the @entity16 will be your new best friend .			1

@entity14 puts the *budget* and blow - out blenders to the test
she and her husband try out five recipes using the two machines
from the *classic* green juice to nut milk @entity14 gives you the verdict
a great way to eat more fruit , vegetables , seeds and nuts
a chance to try fruit and vegetables you do n't normally eat much , like figs and dates
a way to increase your intake of vitamins and minerals
an easy way to eat more fibre
