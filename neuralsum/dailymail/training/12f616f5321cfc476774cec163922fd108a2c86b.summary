in a statement read to the inquest , mr @entity1 , deputy head of £ 25,000 - per - year @entity36 in @entity37 , said : ‘ @entity13 is in many ways an indictment of our failure as a society to tackle the scourge of drugs			1
there are no easy answers of course and we are daily beset by the views and advice of the well - meaning and the misguided , urging us to legalise drugs or build more jails			0
‘ it is complacency that is the greatest challenge to us all			0
we never think it will happen to us or our loved ones			1
we trust it will not be our child who will be tempted			0

it was only the second time he had taken it too late : @entity13 collapsed after friends notice he had turned grey he continued : ‘ until society as a whole stands up and says no to the dealers and no to those in the media and entertainments industry who glorify and trivialise the taking of drugs , we will continue to count the cost in lives lost and families left bereft			0
’ the 51 - year - old added : ‘ it is our profound hope that @entity13 ’s untimely death will serve as a warning to young people of the dangers of taking drugs like @entity20 and the far from benign influence that some would have us believe the ‘ soft ’ drugs culture has on young people			0

shortly after his death , mr @entity1 said : ‘ @entity13 died , in part , because the system failed to protect him that night and it seems to me that this is , at least in part , due to indifference to the hedonistic and destructive culture of drug - taking that seems to be more and more a routine part of nightlife for young people			1
