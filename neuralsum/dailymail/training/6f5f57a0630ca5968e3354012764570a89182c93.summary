the flight of the bumblebee may seem clumsy and slow , but new research claims these humble insects can reach altitudes higher than the peak of @entity6			1
despite their rotund bodies and relatively small wings , researchers from @entity8 found that bees can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human - making them the finest flyers in the insect world			1
in a series of experiments , scientists placed wild bees in a flight chamber and while all managed to fly at heights of 7,500m ( 24,606ft ) , two exceed heights of 9,000m ( 29,528ft )			1
despite their relatively small wings , researchers found that bees , stock image of a bee pictured , can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human			1
in a series of experiments , scientists placed the bees in a flight chamber and two exceed heights of 9,000m ( 29,528ft ) some animals have adapted to live in high altitude areas , where the air is thinner			1
yaks , for example , live in the @entity41 at heights of up to 19,000ft ( 6,000m ) , and can struggle to survive at sea level			2
the highest living insect is a jumping spider called the @entity47 omnisuperstes that lives at heights of up to 6,700m ( 22,000 feet ) on @entity6			2
@entity49 has been found to grow on @entity6 at heights of 6480m ( 21,260 ft ) and it is thought to be the highest altitude plant species in the world			2
the highest flying birds are @entity56 's vultures , @entity58 - headed @entity57 , @entity58 - tailed @entity59 , all of which have been recorded as flying at heights of more than 8,000m ( 26,200ft )			0
dr. @entity63 from the @entity8 captured the six male bumblebees in a region of @entity66 that sits 3,250m ( 10,600ft ) above sea level			1
dr. @entity63 said he has even found bees living in regions with altitudes of 4,800m ( 16,000ft )			0
in 2008 a colony of bumble bees were discovered on @entity6 at more than 5,600m ( 18,300ft ) above sea level , the highest known altitude for an insect			1
by comparison , @entity6 's peak sits at 8,848m ( 29,000ft ) above sea level , and its summit is considered to be the limit of human endurance			1
if this summit was just 100m higher , it would be beyond the reach of climbers			0
those venturing above 8,000m ( 26,200ft ) are said to be entering the ‘ death zone ’			0
dr. @entity63 from the @entity8 captured six male bumblebees in a region of @entity66 that sits 3,250m ( 10,600ft ) above sea level			2
by filming the bees in the chamber , dr. @entity63 observed that to achieve these extreme altitudes , the bumblebees increased the maximum angle at which they flapped their wings , while keeping the same beat frequency			2
forces produced by flapping wings are directly proportional to air density so organisms experience drastic reductions in lift forces in this environment			2
flying insects also exhibit the highest known demand for oxygen compared to mass , making the bumblebee 's feat even more worthy			0
at 9,000m ( 29,528ft ) , air pressure is about a third of that at sea level so it is harder to fly , with less air for wings to beat @entity120 is also harder to breathe			1
dr @entity63 said : ‘ animal flight at altitude involves substantial aerodynamic and physiological challenges			0
hovering at high elevations is particularly demanding from the dual perspectives of lift and power output			0
the bumblebees were found to increase the maximum angle at which they flapped their wings , while keeping the same beat frequency			0
forces produced by flapping wings are directly proportional to air density so organisms experience drastic reductions in lift forces in this environment by comparison , @entity6 's peak , pictured , is at 8,848m ( 29,000ft ) above sea level and its summit is considered to be the limit of human endurance			1
to reach these heights , the bees increased the angle at which they flapped their wings , while keeping the same beat frequency ‘ nevertheless , some volant ( flying ) insects reside and fly at elevations in excess of 4,000m ( 13,100ft )			2
‘ here , we demonstrate alpine bumblebees possess substantial aerodynamic reserves , and can sustain hovering flight under @entity150 ( at altitude ) at effective elevations in excess of 9,000m ( 29,258ft ) - higher than @entity6			1
' during the flight chamber experiments , pictured , all the bees managed to fly at heights of 7,500m ( 24,606ft ) meaning they could fly over at least seven of @entity6 's summits dr @entity63 added : ‘ the presence of such excess capacity in a high altitude bulmblebee is surprising and suggests intermittent behavioural demands for extreme flight performance supplemental to routing foraging			1
' in the past , bumblebees have been discovered on @entity6 at more than 5,600 metres ( 18,000ft ) above sea level			1
some have been found living above 4,000m ( 13,100ft ) for prolonged periods			0
dr @entity63 said : ' @entity170 flight altitudes of insects are largely unknown other than from data obtained remotely with radar , and by the capture of individuals via aerial sampling			0
' these studies suggest free flying insects typically ascend no higher than 5,000m			0
but these are typically insects migrating on air currents , so they benefit little from ascending beyond a few thousand metres			0
' many insect taxa have been captured terrestrially at 5,000 to 5,200m in the @entity41 , and several fly species and butterflies have , remarkably , been captured near 6,000m			0
' the research was published in the @entity187 journal , @entity188 .			0

bumblebees are known for being poor flyers *due* to relatively small wings
researchers placed six bees in a flight chamber and altered the altitude
all were able to fly when the air density at 7,500m ( 24,606ft ) was *simulated*
while two of the bees exceeded altitudes of 9,000m ( 29,528ft )
by comparison , @entity6 's peak is 8,848 ( 29,000ft ) above sea level
