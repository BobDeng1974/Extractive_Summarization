@entity1 midfielder @entity0 scored twice against @entity2 to pile pressure on @entity4			1
@entity4 's second reign as @entity2 manager has not got off to the best of starts as he has witnessed his side lose three of their first four games			1
@entity11 followed up his goal against @entity13 by converting a penalty past @entity15 to open the scoring in the 10th minute			0
@entity2 's team were in complete disarray as their players look downcast following @entity1 's second goal by @entity0 ( not pictured ) @entity21 ( left ) stepped up and slotted an early penalty for @entity1 past the diving @entity15 @entity0 ( on floor ) added a second shortly before half - time to send @entity1 on the way to claiming all three points @entity2 's players have struggled to deal with life @entity29 , following his move to @entity32 after the @entity33 @entity34 ( front left ) , @entity36 ( front centre ) and @entity38 ( front second right ) were part of the beaten @entity2 side @entity42 winger @entity34 was unable to unlock @entity1 's sturdy defence during the @entity45 qualifier @entity1 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity0 , @entity49 ( @entity50 46 ) @entity51 , @entity0 , @entity52 , @entity47 , @entity53 ( @entity54 89 ) , @entity55 subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity49 , @entity64 @entity2 : @entity15 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ( @entity70 78 ) , @entity71 , @entity38 ( @entity72 45 ) , @entity34 , @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 68 ) subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 @entity0 's goal from the spot came after @entity87 was adjudged to have fouled @entity47 inside the area			1
and the midfielder doubled his side 's lead just before the interval when he punished @entity2 for their slack defending inside the box by blasting the ball past the helpless @entity15			0
@entity4 threw on @entity72 at half - time - to join the likes of @entity98 and @entity36 - in hope that he could ignite their attack , however they were unable to find a way back into the game			0
@entity2 started the second half with @entity73 hitting over from outside the box			0
another fine @entity108 cross looked set for his @entity32 team - mate to pull a goal back for @entity2 but the pass was deflected away from the forward 's grasp			2
@entity53 could have made it more comprehensive for the hosts as he broke clear with minutes remaining but failed to hit the target			0
@entity1 now have nine points from nine in @entity118 and sit alongside the @entity119 , who also have a 100 per cent record			1
@entity2 have just three points , with their first ever loss to @entity1 arriving after an opening defeat by the @entity125			2
the expanded version of @entity127 means they remain alive in their bid to qualify , but their form - on the back of @entity33 semi-final disappointment - suggests they will have a job on their hands to make up the gap			0
@entity108 ( left ) , @entity138 ( centre ) and @entity72 ( right ) look disappointed as they leave the pitch following their defeat @entity4 has failed to get the best out of his players since returning as manager of the @entity2 national team @entity32 manager @entity147 guided @entity2 to @entity149 semi-finals during his final weeks in charge @entity1 sit at the top of @entity118 alongside the @entity119 after winning all three of their @entity127 qualifiers			1

@entity2 have lost three of their first four games since @entity4 took over the reins
@entity4 's side have claimed just three points from their opening three euro 2016 qualifiers
@entity1 sit alongside the @entity119 at the top of the group a table
@entity147 helped @entity2 reach the @entity33 semi-finals before joining @entity32
