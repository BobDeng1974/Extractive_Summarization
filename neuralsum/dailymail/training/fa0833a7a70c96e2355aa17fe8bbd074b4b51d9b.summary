' our focus so far today has been documenting the aircraft on scene to the point where we can get it recovered off - site to look at it further , ' @entity114 , a senior air safety investigator with the @entity109 , said at the crash site saturday			1
' we will continue to do that the rest of the day			0
we will also be gathering information on the pilot , his experience , his type of experience , medical certification , things like that			0
' what remains : the crash and fire seems to have left the structure of the plane in a heap of burning ash as only the burnt rubble of the 12 damaged cars remain small : the plane that crashed was a a @entity142 ( like the one pictured ) which can hold up to six people but there were only three passengers on board at the time of the crash yesterday , those who were nearby were telling of their experiences : ' the whole building shook			1
