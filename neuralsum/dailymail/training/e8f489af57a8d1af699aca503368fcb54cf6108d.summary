by @entity0 for most mothers , four children and two grandchildren would be enough to keep busy , but for @entity5 from @entity6 , her real - life brood just was n't enough			1
@entity5 , 40 , was sterilised after her fourth child but subsequently regretted the decision			1
so she decided to fork out more than £ 2,000 on four fake babies and their paraphernalia			1
despite having two children still living at home , @entity5 now spends hours every day dressing , bathing and shopping for her four fake children - and has even splashed out on a real new crib , car seat and @entity20 baskets for the fake tots			1
' they are beautiful and i truly love them			0
i could n’t be without them now and they even smell like real babies			2
' i love all of my children and my grandchildren , but my children have lives of their own now , and my grandchildren go home at the end of the day			2
' @entity5 gave birth to her daughter @entity48 , when she was just 16 , and since then has gone on to have three other children , @entity50 , 22 , @entity51 , 15 and @entity52 , 13			1
brotherly love : @entity27 and @entity25 snuggling up @entity24 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) both seem a little camera shy for their portrait but after giving birth to @entity52 , @entity5 , who has never had a job , decided to be sterilised			1
after she procedure , however , she regretted it , and longed to have another baby			1
so she bought four reborn dolls - @entity25 , @entity54 , @entity24 and @entity27 - and now loves being a full - time ' mum ' to them			1
she said , ' there is just something about babies which i love			0
i love being around them , dressing them and looking after them			0
' i just want to nurture and when i had my sterilisation , i felt a great sense of loss that i would never have a baby of my own to nurture again			1
' it made me feel really low , and very sad for a long time			2
' a trip : @entity5 in his real car seat but @entity5 came across @entity84 ’s shop @entity85 in @entity6 18 months ago - and after visiting the shop a few times , she finally plucked up the courage to buy her first doll			1
@entity5 said , ' i bought @entity54 for £ 100 and she was simply beautiful			1
i was in love , and as soon as i cuddled her the feeling of sadness went away completely			0
' it was like i had filled a hole in my life			0
' the dolls are handcrafted by @entity84 to resemble real - life babies			1
@entity5 now has now spent £ 1,000 on four of her reborn dolls , which she treats in the same way she would her own children - and claims to have spent at least the same again on clothes and accessories for them			1
@entity27 looking cute as a button and incredibly real with piercing blue eyes and a little bit of a snuffle in his nose @entity24 surrounded by her enviable wardrobe she said : ' i have beds , and @entity20 baskets for each of them , and they take it in turns to sleep in the crib in my room			2
' every evening i change them into their pyjamas and tuck them into bed and every day i change them , give them fresh nappies and put them in their day clothes			0
' i know some people might think i ’m mad but so many of my friends have been amazed by how happy the dolls can make people			0
' when you cuddle them , they feel like a baby , because their heads lull and they even smell like a real baby , because of the fabric softener their clothes are washed in			2
' happy families : wendy with babies ( left to right ) @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity26 @entity5 spends as much time as she can with @entity146 in her shop , watching how the babies are made and helping @entity146 dress the babies			2
and she even has a car seat for the babies , so when she goes to visit family members her reborn dolls can come too			0
@entity5 said : ' i have n’t taken them out into town yet , but as soon as i get a pram and i can wrap them up i will do			2
' i know people are a bit wary of the dolls or think it is a bit mad , but the comfort i get from them makes my life			0
' @entity167 manages to get all four babies to stay still for a photo ( left ) and demonstrates how she dresses @entity26 ( right ) ' it ’s not about companionship , but i love having the dolls which are all mine to look after , ' she added			0
baby - mad @entity5 has used her savings to partly fund the dolls and is still paying off the rest in weekly installments			1
but she is now looking for a job , to earn enough money to treat herself to more babies			0
she added , ' they are absolutely beautiful and real works of art. my daughter @entity183 loves them as well and she will often help me dress the babies ready for bed			0
' i have used some clothes for them from when my children were young , but i do like to go shopping for new things for them as well			0
' she added , ' i would recommend the dolls to any woman , young or old , who loves babies and longs to look after them			0
' these dolls are n’t like child ’s dollies - there are handcrafted masterpieces , with lifelike eyes , eyelashes and hands and feet			0
' they are just like real babies - except without the crying and the sleepless nights - which suits me perfectly			0
