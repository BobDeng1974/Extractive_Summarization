a @entity1 woman has become only the second person in the history of @entity4 to win a million dollar grand prize			1
on thursday night , @entity6 of @entity7 started her turn as a spinner of the big wheel with at least a little more luck than most : she ’s 30 years old , it was the shows 30th anniversary , and it was may 30th			1
but until may 30 , only one of the show ’s thousands of contestants since 1983 has ever successfully taken home such a huge sum			1
first , the contestant must be have the good fortune of landing on the million dollar prize wedge during game play and then correctly answer the subsequent question			1
if they do , they get to hold on to the wedge			0
in this case , @entity35 ’s parents and fiancé did the honors			1
if the player makes it through the rest of the game without hitting the ‘ bankrupt ’ wheel wedge and then beats the other two contestants to go on to the bonus round , then the usual $ 100,000 grand prize is replaced with the million dollar wedge			1
serendipity : @entity35 's big historic win came during the long - running game show 's 30th anniversary season historic : @entity35 , seen here is her family wishing her luck and holding the game piece that let her spin for a million dollars , beat all odds to become only the second million dollar winner in @entity25 history @entity35 made it that far			1
she spun the bonus wheel and took an as yet unopened envelope -- her future prize			0
but it did n’t look like it was going to be hers at first			0
she was left with only four letters revealed to help her solve the final puzzle			1
that was even after she used a bonus letter she 'd picked up over the course of the regular game			1
' this looks challenging , ' said longtime host @entity76 , before encouraging @entity35			0
' talk it out , you 're a good player , you never know			1
' but @entity35 did n't need the encouragement			0
nor did she need to talk it out , as most contestants do in the final round			0
in what feels like half a second , @entity35 spits out her answer			0
' tough workout , ' she said			0
@entity88 threw up her hands in astonishment and @entity76 squawked ' what ! ' and when the letter board lit up , she knew she 'd won the game with impressive ease			2
with a big smile , she waited as @entity76 opened her prize envelope to reveal the largest cash prize the game has to offer			2
' we have a million dollar winner , ' @entity76 said , showing the envelope 's glittering contents to the camera and audience			1
early wedding gift : @entity35 ( right ) , a @entity105 graduate recently became engaged to fiance @entity106 ( right ) recently got engaged great timing : @entity108 , right , works in construction -- an industry hit hard by the global recession -- but things will certainly be looking up for the couple after @entity115 's big win happy couple : the couple 's wedding is scheduled for july 2014 , though they they already received the biggest gift they could possibly expect the impressive feat was followed by a much deserved exaltation from @entity35 and her thrilled family , including fiancé @entity108			0
‘ no one could believe it , ’ @entity35 told @entity126 of the big moment just before her family realized what had happened			0
‘ they were just off stage and could n't see what my prize was			0
they were celebrating the fact that i solved the puzzle			2
they kept asking me how much i won , and i had to keep repeating it because no one believed me at first			0
’ the million dollar wedge was added to the bonus wheel in 2008			1
the first , and only other million dollar winner was @entity145 in october of that year			1
domination : @entity35 dominated throughout the game			2
compared to her winnings , her competitors took home pennies : one got $ 2,000 while the other won $ 1000 @entity153 her breath : @entity35 nearly blew it when only four letters showed up to help her solve the final puzzle amazing : @entity35 solved the puzzle , ' @entity159 ' with only four letters and ' thing ' as a clue , so quickly even game show veteran @entity88 could hardly believe it @entity145 had just gotten home from her honeymoon in 2008 when she was told she would be taping the show			1
' i got home from my honeymoon on a monday , ' she told the @entity169			0
' they called me on wednesday and i taped the show that friday			2
' the @entity173 native was living in @entity1 with her new husband when she became the show 's first millionaire			2
she and her husband met while working at a @entity179 restaurant			0
watch the first million dollar winner her winning phrase was ' @entity183			1
' asked what she would do with all the dough , the then 24 - year - old said she 'd like to buy a car			1
' and i 'll help out my parents and my sister , ' she said			0
@entity145 ’s takehome of $ 1,026,080 in cash and prizes remained the highest in @entity25 history until now			2
her record has now been bested by @entity35 ’s $ 1,030,340 in cash prizes , including trips to @entity198 and @entity199			2
beaten expectations : ' i am in complete and utter shock , ' said @entity35 , who 'd gone on the show just hoping to solve a few puzzles and earn money for her upcoming wedding @entity35 is a sales representative for a veterinary pharmaceutical company and her fiancé works in construction			1
no word yet on how they ’ll spend the money , by @entity35 is likely still just trying to calm down from the initial thrill			0
‘ i wanted to have some fun and solve some puzzles , she said			2
' i feel like i 'm in a dream ! ’ @entity35 said that , prior to the show , she was hoping to win some money to put towards her upcoming wedding			0
' i am in complete and utter shock , ' she said			0
unbelievable : as her family gathered , @entity35 said they were unaware how lucky she was , ' they were celebrating the fact that i solved the puzzle			1
they kept asking me how much i won '			0

with just two @entity233 ’s , an @entity234 , and a @entity235 , she *miraculously* comes up with ' @entity159 ' to solve the million dollar puzzle in mere seconds !
the lucky 30 - year - old was a player on the 30th anniversary season of the game show , which aired may 30th
