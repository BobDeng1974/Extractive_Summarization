there is something about the subject of @entity3 that is guaranteed to get under the skin of @entity6 manager @entity5			1
perhaps , after naming him as a substitute for the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity10 in the @entity11 at @entity12 , he just does n’t really fancy him			1
it has always felt that way			0
@entity5 picked @entity15 to play in goal ahead of @entity3 as the countdown to @entity6 ’s title defence gets under way			1
‘ @entity3 finished last season playing well			2
we will see next sunday who starts at @entity28			0
’ on sunday , @entity29 , the @entity30 keeper who worked with @entity5 at @entity31 , looked no better than @entity3			1
priced at £ 6million , he looked ordinary			0
in a head - to - head , @entity3 has won two @entity38 titles with @entity6 and is the established first choice @entity33 keeper ( not that that says very much )			1
at 32 , @entity29 ’s last big trophy win was the @entity40 with @entity41 in 2003			0
he was so far off the radar of @entity45 coach @entity44 he did n’t even make their @entity47 squad			0
@entity5 , though , is a title - winning coach with @entity6 and his views , difficult to comprehend on this matter , ought to be respected			1
he knows what @entity29 is capable of , even if we saw no evidence of it during a disturbing performance from the champions			0
average : will @entity29 failed to impress on his competitive debut in the @entity11 no protection : @entity15 was not helped by a second string @entity6 defence in front of him @entity3 , who won his second @entity38 medal last season , played 90 minutes against @entity64 in the @entity66 @entity65 last week and got half a game against @entity68 on july 31			1
even taking into account an extended break since the @entity47 , he has not spent enough time in goal during @entity6 ’s pre-season			1
‘ @entity3 only arrived 10 days ago and the other players have been working for longer , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 only arrived seven days ago			0
we will see who is ready and who is not next week			0
’ @entity6 looked anything but ready on sunday			2
to be fair to @entity29 , the four defenders in front of him — @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 — were a huge disappointment			0
captain @entity78 and new signing @entity79 were in the stands to watch their team pulled all over the pitch by this fluid @entity10 team			2
‘ @entity79 , what ’s the score ? ’ crowed @entity10 ’s supporters and they had every right to have a dig. based on this , he made the wrong choice			2
glove and war : @entity3 has hardly been involved in @entity6 's pre-season after an extended break in april 2011 , just as @entity6 were about to really get going under @entity111 , the @entity12 experience was something special			1
@entity114 ’s players posed for selfies before kick - off and went souvenir hunting after beating @entity118 1 - 0 in the @entity120 semi-final			1
everything , from the smell of the freshly - cut lawn at the national stadium to the @entity125 soap dispensers in the industrial - sized dressing rooms , was unique			0
on sunday , the champions of @entity33 , on their sixth visit to the @entity12 since that victory in the semi-final , played like they did n’t want to be there			1
it was a chance for @entity5 to show that this team is ready for the challenges ahead			2
instead they could n’t get out of the place quick enough			0
video my team were n't ready second best : after trading barbs , @entity139 got the better of @entity5 at @entity12 @entity141 counts his @entity11 success with @entity143 in 2005 , plus equivalent @entity145 win with @entity146 and @entity147 , as a trophy			1
this is the start of the season , an official fixture that is broadcast around the world			0
perhaps they are getting a bit too casual , too familiar with that walk into the @entity12 dressing rooms now they are a major force again			0
at @entity28 , when they walk on to the field as defending @entity38 champions , they will have to show who is no 1			2

@entity10 defeated @entity6 3 - 0 in the @entity11 at @entity12
@entity5 preferred @entity15 to @entity3 in goal
former @entity31 keeper failed to impress on his first competitive start
@entity33 keeper has hardly been involved in the @entity179 pre-season
@entity3 is likely to *return* as no 1 once the @entity38 season begins
