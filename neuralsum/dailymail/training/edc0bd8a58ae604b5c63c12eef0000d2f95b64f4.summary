by @entity0 angry : @entity1 with his wife @entity2 it 's been a bad week for me and my husband , @entity1 , the @entity6 mp for @entity7			1
he ’s been bullied and abused by his colleagues in his own party for daring to discuss the future of all - women shortlists			1
‘ sexist and misogynistic , ’ said @entity13 , shadow children ’s minister			1
‘ it ’s the old , cloth - eared , macho politics , ’ growled @entity6 aristocrat dame @entity14			1
and @entity6 mp @entity17 joined the ladies , describing his neighbour and colleague as ‘ self - serving , chauvinistic , antiquated ’			1
@entity21 has been battered all over the media since his article in last week ’s @entity24 where he gave his views on selecting many @entity6 candidates for next year ’s election from all - women shortlists ( @entity29 )			1
shadow attorney general @entity30 mp weighed in with ‘ suspect his wife @entity2 is not amused either , is she ? ’			1
you ’re right , @entity30			2
i have , for as long as i can remember , been a feminist			2
and i have , from their inception before the 1997 election , been an enthusiastic supporter of @entity29			2
of the 120 women who became mps in 1997 , 101 were @entity6			1
they changed the face of @entity42 for ever			2
i was so thrilled i wrote a book , @entity44			2
however , there have been some disturbing trends of late : seats where only one or two women applied , seats fixed in advance for favoured daughters			1
@entity29 should not become the ‘ old boy network ’ in a skirt			2
most concerning of all , it appears to have become untouchable			2
any suggestion of change or modification is howled down and treated with derision			2
@entity21 wrote a perfectly sensible piece exploring the possibilities for an end to @entity29			1
he was neither hysterical nor misogynist			0
he said many things i would wholeheartedly support ( albeit in less careful language than i ’d have used )			0
for this he has been utterly vilified			0
the @entity63 got their teeth in and held on all week : ‘ i can not wait till your generation finally dies , ’ screamed one			0
@entity21 was determined to stand down before the 2015 election			0
he ’d had serious heart problems in 2013 , and it would have been hard to go on with his 80th birthday coming up			0
there had been speculation of an @entity29 in @entity7 since january when @entity74 was rumoured to be set to become @entity6 ’s prospective parliamentary candidate			1
we began to be worried about the process : was it predestination or a fair choice ? @entity21 had seen @entity80 and the chief whip @entity81 several times to discuss the timing of his announcement			0
@entity85 , @entity80 ’s political fixer , was always at the meetings			0
@entity21 says she gently explained to him , as she would to any out - of - touch geriatric , that @entity29 was for the good of the party , not @entity7			1
from then on it unfolded like a plan imposed from above			0
@entity74 ’s name was floated by the leadership as @entity95			1
a month before polling day it looked as though there might be only two : @entity74 and a local councillor			1
dozens had applied to be the mp for @entity7 in 1977 when @entity21 had been selected			1
women want seats that are convenient to get home to			1
you ca n’t say that about @entity7			1
female politicians often have needs and responsibilities not experienced by most men			0
whatever the @entity6 sisterhood might tell you , in the real world , women , including politicians , still do most of the childcare and want to spend time with their kids during the working week			1
a constituency nearer @entity121 or on a direct train route gives them a better chance of doing that			0
by the time @entity29 was announced in @entity7 , @entity74 had a strong foothold in the local party and was ready to roll , strongly supported by the unison union			1
@entity21 made it clear he would take no part in the selection , but i felt there should be no such inhibition for me			0
so i set out to find some good strong women who might be interested			2
i spoke to several , but could persuade none			0
@entity7 was too far , too off the beaten track			1
nearly all had childcare responsibilities as well as their careers as politicians			0
others had heard @entity7 had been ‘ stitched up ’ for @entity74			1
only @entity143 , chief executive of the @entity144 , bravely decided to give it a go			0
an experienced campaigner and terrific candidate , she ran @entity74 close , winning the first round of an exhaustive ballot , but losing in the end by a handful of votes			1
it was a view widely held locally that @entity74 had been gifted the seat			1
the way the @entity157 acted , and strong union support gave her a head start			0
she had more , better , earlier , glossier leaflets , and she was a local party worker , born in the constituency			0
all the other candidates started behind , and stayed there			0
@entity165 mp , pictured left , went head - to - head on the issue with mr @entity1 on @entity169 , which was presented by @entity170 , pictured right that was the atmosphere in which @entity21 wrote his piece for @entity24			1
the jihad sisters who ’d decided it was best to keep the old boy out of the process until @entity74 was safely selected , rose up as one to abuse him			1
of course they never bothered to read what he actually wrote			0
the name @entity1 and @entity29 in the same sentence was all it needed			1
like trained guerilla fighters , they went for him with both barrels and chucked in a couple of hand grenades and a shoulder - launched missile for good measure			2
then the @entity189 ’s @entity169 picked up the baton and handed it to @entity165 mp			2
@entity165 and @entity169 ’s @entity170 were in the studio in @entity121			0
@entity21 was in the @entity194 room in @entity195 perched on a stool in front of a monitor which showed him only a picture of himself or a newsfeed of events in @entity202			0
he remained there for 45 minutes			0
@entity21 is at the best of times fairly deaf , an advantage in politics but not on @entity169			0
he could n’t see what was going on and he heard little			0
@entity165 had decided that the way to win was to interrupt @entity21 if he even opened his mouth			0
this she did very successfully			0
it looked hilarious : two women talking urgently among themselves while a bewildered older man appeared above and between them in what seemed to be a glass box			2
he was looking puzzled and holding up his hands in a ‘ do n’t shoot me ’ kind of way			0
when women finally do take over the world , i imagine scenes like this will be commonplace			2
i ’m still an enthusiastic supporter of @entity29			0
but i am deeply disappointed that the women at the top of the @entity226 think it is perfectly ok to ‘ diss ’ an old and long - serving male mp just to demonstrate how tough they are .			1

@entity6 mp for @entity7 explored possibility of end of all - women shortlists
came as @entity74 named as town 's prospective parliamentary candidate
several @entity238 *criticised* mr @entity1 as ' misogynistic ' and ' chauvinistic '
@entity2 is ' deeply disappointed ' at action of senior women @entity6 mps
