by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 06:58 est , 6 february 2013 there were two pivotal events in 1974 in the life of @entity4 , legendary lead singer of @entity5 , who died of lung cancer this week at the age of 71			1
the first , which i witnessed , took place at @entity11 in @entity12 , where i was studying			0
the @entity5 , having had a series of hits in the @entity15 , were then at their career nadir , playing a college gig for a fee that would have amounted to no more than £ 100			1
' obsession ' : @entity4 ( third from left ) , seen with his @entity5 bandmates in @entity21 in 1965 , was fascinated by unexplained phenomena a group of what newspapers of the era would have described as ‘ members of the @entity28 ’ were tormenting the band , jeering insults and aiming spurts of fizzy drinks at the lead singer			1
@entity34 , the band ’s huge hit of 1966 , had gone down a storm , but the bikers had turned truculent as soon as the band started playing @entity40 — the song that would later spark the @entity5 ’ renaissance			1
all of a sudden , @entity4 hurled himself off the stage - disappearing in a tangled , thrashing heap along with his tormentors			1
the concert was at an end			0
in the subsequent melee , two of the band were stabbed			0
@entity51 , the guitarist , nearly died ; another was bottled and @entity4 emerged with a broken nose			1
it was a miracle that none of them was killed , but their narrow escape was nowhere near as miraculous as @entity4 ’s experience several weeks later			0
mysterious : the singer was convinced aliens were behind a spate of elaborate crop circles in @entity12 and @entity64 fields in the 1990s still nursing his bruises at the @entity67 home he shared with his wife @entity68 , he was dozing in front of the tv in the middle of the afternoon when he heard a news bulletin about a huge fire at @entity74 , @entity75 in which 28 people died			1
few of the regulars at @entity79 ’s local , the @entity80 in @entity81 , are unfamiliar with what happened next , the singer having related the story countless times in his soft @entity12 burr			1
‘ i tell my wife about the fire , ’ he would say			0
‘ six o’clock , i turn on the news again and it says the explosion only happened at eight minutes to five			0
‘ how did i see a report about a disaster four hours before it happened ? could the broadcast signal have been affected by gravity ? ’ theories : @entity4 , seen with his wife @entity68 , died this week following a battle with lung cancer even if gravity did have an effect on television signals - an effect hitherto unknown to physics - it remains unclear why this would allow @entity4 to pick up and decode a signal before it was broadcast			1
but @entity4 was never overly - concerned by the details of the unexplained phenomena with which he subsequently became obsessed			1
ufos ; aliens ; the true origins of ancient stone circles			2
@entity4 was happy to theorise on all of them with scant regard to conventional science or history			0
however , it was one particular aspect of the paranormal with which @entity4 became most closely associated : crop circles			1
when there was a spate of mysterious and increasingly elaborate patterns in @entity12 and @entity64 fields in the early 1990s , @entity4 was fascinated - and quick to offer an explanation			1
the cereal fields of south - western @entity124 were , he said , a stopping point for extraterrestrial craft , and the mysterious giant symbols were clearly messages - perhaps even warnings - from an alien intelligence to a doomed humanity			2
with a fellow scholar of the unexplained , retired @entity67 driving instructor @entity133 , @entity4 spent the next few years hastening to each new circle as it appeared , and offering his interpretation of the symbol ’s hidden meaning			0
‘ we met first on july 17 , 1990 , at the giant crop circle at @entity141 near @entity142 , and we became firm friends , ’ @entity133 recalls			2
‘ we explored many circles together			2
he was of the older generation who would not hesitate to help people and talk through their possible meaning			0
’ @entity79 ascribed great significance to the fact that many circles appeared in a triangle between @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			2
‘ look at the first few letters of each place , ’ he told an interviewer in 1994			0
‘ @entity159 , want , win			0
is that a message , or what ? ’ such was worldwide enthusiasm for the crop circles that @entity79 and @entity133 were soon giving talks around the country , and going on lecture tours in the @entity167 and @entity21			1
often , the talks would be accompanied by a @entity5 gig			1
when the huge success of the film @entity170 brought @entity4 an unexpected windfall - @entity174 ’s cover of @entity40 was used in the 1994 movie and topped the charts for 15 weeks - he used the money to fund his interest			2
he even wrote a book , @entity181 they do n’t tell @entity167 , which explored alien abductions , crop circles , and what he saw as the close relationship between ufos and ancient monuments			1
when crop circles were eventually proved to have been created by pranksters , @entity4 and @entity133 refused to concede defeat			1
although they accepted that 75 per cent of shapes were man - made , they maintained that the rest defied explanation			2
@entity195 : the band struggled during the 1970s and ' 80s , but experienced a career renaissance after @entity40 featured in four weddings and a funeral ‘ @entity4 was about the most grounded , sensible person i ’ve encountered in the music business , ’ says his life - long friend , music publicist @entity200			2
‘ but he had a tendency to watch an episode of @entity207 and believe it was true			0
‘ it was a terrible setback when crop circles were debunked , but he clung to the hope that at least a few of them were genuine			1
’ it was @entity200 who gave @entity4 his surname ( after @entity217 ) in 1966 , two years after @entity5 were formed			1
‘ @entity219 ’ was just insufficiently ‘ rock ’ n ’ roll ’			0
‘ when he read the new name in @entity221 , he rang me to ask ( with his wonderful country boy accent ) whether he ’d been dropped from the band , ’ @entity200 recalls			0
@entity4 , a bricklayer by trade , also used to tell the story of how he was working on a building when he heard the first @entity5 single on the radio			1
‘ share my tools out , lads - i ’m off , ’ he announced			2
the 1970s and @entity230 were hard decades for the band , but then the film @entity170 allowed @entity4 to emerge from obscurity and find success on the rock ’ n ’ roll nostalgia circuit , even playing at @entity239 ’s wedding a decade ago			0
‘ he never lost his enthusiasm for little green men and @entity242 , ’ says @entity200			1
‘ shortly before he died , he contacted me to say that there was a large aircraft hanger underneath the @entity245 in @entity246 - and he was sure there was a @entity242 parked there			1
would @entity239 put up a bit of money , he asked , to help find it ? ‘ but despite that , he could be teased about his views and never seemed offended			0
he was a very sweet country boy			0
’ @entity4 ’s musical legacy is uncertain			0
it is difficult to tell how history will remember a lyricist capable of penning lines such as ‘ a boy ’s not a boy and a man ’s not a man till he ’s been with a girl like my @entity264 ’ and ‘ my lady owns an oil well			0
just one look , and you can tell			0
’ appropriately , news of his death was made public by the @entity271 after an @entity167 phoned from @entity272 having read an item on the @entity275 account of former @entity277 sports commentator and outer - world obsessive @entity280 @entity279 - who knew @entity4 well - came by the news is a mystery			2
perhaps @entity4 would have preferred to have been abducted by aliens and borne away in a celestial hearse			0
but his many friends and fans are grateful he died peacefully at home with his family nearby .			0
