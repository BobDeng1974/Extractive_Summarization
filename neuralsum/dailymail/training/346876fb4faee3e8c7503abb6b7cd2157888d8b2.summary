mixed emotions : statue of @entity2 kneeling in @entity4 ghetto where tens of thousands of @entity5 died has upset descendents a modern artist has caused huge controversy after placing a statue of @entity2 praying on his knees in the former @entity11			1
some @entity5 groups have expressed fury at the ' senseless ' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of @entity5 were forced to live during the rule of the @entity19 regime			1
in total , around 300,000 @entity5 from the @entity11 died or were sent to their death in concentration camps			1
the statue by @entity25 artist @entity24 , entitled ' @entity26 ' , has attracted a large number of visitors since its installation last month			1
the work is visible only from a distance , and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into @entity2 's pose			1
organisers of the exhibition of which the statue is a part say its point is to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but some are angered by its placement in such a sensitive site			1
one @entity5 advocacy group , the @entity47 , this week called the statue 's placement ' a senseless provocation which insults the memory of the @entity53 ' @entity5 victims '			1
' as far as the @entity5 were concerned , @entity2 's only " prayer " was that they be wiped off the face of the earth , ' said the group 's @entity58 director , @entity57			1
however , others have praised the artwork 's emotional impact			2
and organisers defend putting it on display in the former ghetto			1
@entity67 , director of the @entity68 , which oversaw the installation , said : ' there is no intention from the side of the artist or the center to insult @entity5 memory			1
controversy : this statue of @entity2 on his knees praying has been installed in the @entity11 ' it 's an artwork that tries to speak about the situation of hidden evil everywhere			1
' the @entity11 was an area of the city which the @entity53 sealed off after they invaded @entity84			0
they forced @entity5 to live in cramped , inhuman conditions there as they awaited deportation to death camps			2
many died from hunger or disease or were shot by the @entity93 before they could be transported to the camps			0
hidden : the statue by @entity25 artist @entity24 is visible only through a hole in a door fury : the statue has drawn condemnation from @entity5 groups which regard it as a ' senseless provocation ' the @entity2 installation is just one object in a retrospective of @entity24 's work titled ' @entity107 ' , a show that explores life , death , good and evil			1
the other works are on display at the centre itself , which is housed in the @entity116			0
the statue is visible from a hole in a wooden gate across town on @entity121			2
viewers only see the back of the small figure praying in a courtyard			0
because of its small size , it appears to be a harmless schoolboy			0
' every criminal was once a tender , innocent and defenseless child , ' the centre says in a commentary on the work			0
visitors : some who have seen the statue praised its shocking emotional impact thought - provoking : exhibition organisers say they want viewers to reflect on the nature of evil the @entity11 was established in the @entity84 capital in 1940 , while the country was being occupied by @entity19			1
all 400,000 @entity5 living in the city , which was then a major centre of @entity5 culture , were ordered to live in the area , which was surrounded by a 10ft wall			2
even though the @entity152 housed 30 per cent of @entity4 's population , it occupied just one - fortieth of the city 's area , leading to unbearably cramped conditions			0
the area was plagued with disease and starvation , causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between july and september 1942 , when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the @entity164 camp , where nearly all were murdered by the @entity53			0
in january 1943 , @entity93 soldiers started another round of deportations , but this time the @entity5 residents fought back			2
the @entity170 briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations , but later that year was brutally put down			0
56,000 @entity5 were killed or deported in retribution			2
@entity84 's chief rabbi , @entity173 , said he was consulted on the installation 's placement ahead of time and did not oppose it because he accepted the artist 's attempt to raise moral questions by provoking viewers			0
he said he was reassured by curators who told him there was no intention of rehabilitating @entity2 , but rather of showing that evil can present itself in the guise of a ' sweet praying child '			2
' i felt there could be educational value to it , ' said mr @entity173 , who also wrote an introduction to the exhibition 's catalogue in which he says art can ' force us to face the evil of the world			2
' on friday , a stream of people walked by to view the work , and many praised it			0
' it had a big emotional impact on me			0
it 's provocative , but it 's not offensive , ' said @entity208 , a 30 - year - old lawyer			0
' having him pray in the place where he would kill people - this was the best place to put it			0
' @entity24 caused controversy in @entity4 in 2000 when another gallery showed his work ' @entity216 ' - ' @entity217 ' - which depicts pope @entity218 being crushed by a meteorite			1
that offended many in @entity84 , which is deeply catholic and was @entity218 's homeland .			0
