by @entity0 published : 06:57 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 26 august 2013 a desktop scanner that can create detailed 3d computers models of almost any object has gone on sale for £ 900 ( $ 1,400 )			1
when used with a 3d printer , the @entity5 can create anything from toys to practical objects such as furniture , simply by scanning a device that ’s already in existence			1
the digitizer , which claims to be able to scan eight inch objects in around 12 minutes , will be shipped to first buyers in october			1
it works by scanning the contours on the surface of an object using several lasers			0
these lasers help capture details as small as 0.5 mm , and surface depth as shallow as 0.5 mm. the device then turns the data points into a computer model that can be used to replicate the object using a 3d printer			1
the system works by scanning the contours on the surface of an object using several lasers			0
these lasers help capture details as small as 0.5 mm , and surface depth as shallow as 0.5 mm the device turns the data points that were collected with the help of lasers into a computer model that can be used to replicate the object using a 3d printer the output is a standard 3d model file format ( @entity57 ) and can be modified and improved in third - party 3d modelling programs , like @entity61 ’s free software @entity62			1
users can also upload their designs to @entity65 , a website where 3d designs can be shared			1
however , the company has warned that expectations for the device should be realistic			0
3d printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file			1
they work in an extremely simple way , by building up a 3d object from layers of material			2
like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base			2
further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object			2
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
shoes , jewellery and even dresses have been created , with designs often sold online			2
many believe it could even lead to ' mini factories ' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance			0
‘ you will not be able to , for example , scan a hamburger and then eat the digital design			2
expectations for precision should be realistic , too			0
‘ the @entity110 is not ideal for engineers who require very high precision scanning			0
’ the system is also unable to scan objects with surfaces that are shiny , reflective or fuzzy			1
video : @entity110 ceo @entity117 introduces the @entity110 the @entity5 is one in a range of products attempting to break into the emerging home 3d printing market			1
last month electronics company @entity121 became the first major high - street retailer in the @entity123 to sell 3d printers			2
the group is currently selling the @entity126 for £ 700			0
@entity128 customers could also soon design their own items , go into a supermarket and have them printed in @entity25			0
the group said it is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores			0
ideas include digitally making clothing , furniture , personal gifts and even food in their shops			0
the @entity5 , which claims to be able to scan eight inch objects in around 12 minutes , will be shipped to first buyers in october			1

the @entity5 can scan eight inch objects in around 12 minutes
the designs can be used to create objects using a standard 3d printer
@entity26 based @entity24 will be shipping systems to buyers in october
