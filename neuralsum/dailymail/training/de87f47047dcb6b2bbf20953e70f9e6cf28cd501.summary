study found celebrity reinventions are behind women 's growing confidence women today contrasted with those of the @entity6 , who confessed to never reinventing their appearance by @entity9 published : 08:46 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 19:20 est , 17 may 2012 celebrities who constantly reinvent themselves have inspired millions of women to dramatically change their appearance , according to new research			1
high profile queens of reinvention - such as @entity15 and @entity16 - have influenced everyday women with an estimated 3.5 million changing their own look after seeing celebrities successfully do the same			1
and mature masters of reinvention - such as @entity21 and @entity22 - have inspired older women , who might have previously stuck to a tried - and - tested style , to undergo a complete overhaul of their wardrobes and appearance too			1
image overhaul : a sophisticated @entity16 at the @entity29 in february 2012 , and right , in 2007 , with crop , deep tan and push - up bra fashion changes at a faster pace these days than ever before , making it easier for women to reinvent themselves			1
but for today 's adventurous women , reinvention means more than trying a new shade of lipstick			1
now it involves a complete departure from one look in favour of another			2
just as @entity16 changed her blonde crop for brunette bob , and her club - style for ladylike chic , so everyday women are performing such sartorial one - eightys			1
a total of 2.4 million over 50s will have rebooted their wardrobe ten times before they reach their 60s - ditching the clothes , shoes , make up and accessories associated with certain looks			2
and it does not just stop at clothes			2
the study revealed that 3.8m women have radically changed their hair 11 times over the past ten years , experimenting with perms , fringes , bobs and everything in between			1
a further 2.5 million have dramatically altered their hair colour 12 times in order to reinvent themselves , sporting shades of blonde , black , platinum , grey , red - even purple - in the name of fashion			2
a study of 1,000 @entity82 women for online retailer isme.com found the average @entity82 woman experiences an ' eight - year reinvention itch ' , with 40 per cent of over 50s having changed themselves more in the last ten years than at any other time in their lives			1
reasons why women overhaul their image include the desire to escape a fashion rut , cited by nearly one in five of those surveyed , or to be taken seriously int he workplace , a reason cited by one in ten of those surveyed			1
queen of reinvention : over the three decades she has been in the public eye , @entity15 has tried every look going , from punk to grunge to ladylike chic and in the early years : madonna in the 1985 film desperately seeking @entity106 however , 73 per cent feel the desire to reinvent themselves comes from fashion being so accessible and immediate nowadays - giving ladies more opportunity to continually change how they look regardless of age			2
the top celebrity chameleons were @entity15 ( 48 per cent ) , @entity16 ( 29 per cent ) and @entity114 ( 28 per cent )			1
this morning agony aunt @entity115 also featured on the list ( 10 per cent )			0
figures also revealed two - thirds of mature women in the 1980s had never reinvented their appearance for the duration of their adult lives			1
@entity125 psychologist , @entity124 , said : ' when we look in the mirror , we expect to see a very familiar image , and we have to do this every day			0
' reinventing our image not only to makes other people sit up and take notice of us , but also allows us to express an aspect of our multifaceted personalities			1
' a change of image can mark a milestone in our lives - spelling a renewed sexiness , a youthful attitude , sophistication , rebellion , high self - value ; any number of messages that help people around us understand what is going on in our life before we 've said a word to them			0
' @entity151 of @entity152 said : ' women 's bodies go through three key phases of change - from adolescence to womanhood , once again when we have had families , and a third time as we pass our late 40s			1
this also drives the clothes choices we make , whether consciously or subconsciously			0
' it 's natural to like to experiment in our youth , but as we get older we develop a much stronger sense of personal style and understanding of our bodies			2
