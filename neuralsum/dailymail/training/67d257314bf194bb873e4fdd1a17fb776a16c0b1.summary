a school at the centre of an alleged takeover plot by @entity4 hardliners could now face strict government sanctions following a snap @entity7 inspection			1
@entity8 in @entity9 has been condemned in recent weeks for increasing ‘ islamisation ’ , hosting extremist preachers during assemblies and apparently encouraging girls to cover their hair			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity16 had launched a separate probe into the school over the misuse of public funds to pay £ 70,000 for playground loudspeakers to summon pupils to @entity24 prayers			1
@entity8 , where @entity25 is executive head , allegedly spent £ 70,00 on speakers to summon pupils to @entity24 prayer whistleblowing teachers have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body , forcing non-muslims out and replacing them with hardliners			1
earlier this month a letter was circulated referring to a ‘ @entity42 ’ plot for @entity24 extremists to take over the running of schools			1
the authenticity of the letter is unclear but its very existence led to a flood of allegations from staff at schools in the city			2
following the @entity7 inspection , @entity52 – previously rated ‘ outstanding ’ – will be downgraded to ‘ inadequate ’			0
this enables @entity7 to place the school , in the inner - city suburb of @entity56 , in special measures , giving the watchdog the power to remove the governing body			1
meanwhile , according to the @entity64 , pupils at @entity62 in @entity63 were led in @entity66 chanting by a teacher in assembly			0
@entity62 , which like @entity52 has many @entity24 pupils and its own madrasa – or @entity24 school – has organised at least three trips to the holy city of @entity74 , subsidised from public funds , and requires all pupils to learn @entity77			1
its respected non-muslim head - teacher , @entity78 , recently left her post for resisting this increasingly radical agenda , according to fellow teachers			1
mrs @entity83 is among four of the school ’s six - strong senior management team who have left in the past six months			2
@entity88 in @entity9 , it is currently under investigation by the @entity90 last week it emerged how other teachers were forced out by hardliners in a similar way after opposing plans to ban sex education and stop the teachings of other religions			1
@entity99 , a former associate headteacher at @entity52 , described the latest action taken by @entity7 as ‘ a step in the right direction ’			0
but he condemned @entity103 for ‘ failing to take action at the time ’			0
mr @entity99 said the council and government have been ‘ too afraid to upset communities , choosing to sweep things under the carpet ’			0
it is not known whether the decision to retire by @entity52 ’s current head , @entity25 , is related to pressure from @entity24 on the governing body			0
@entity116 , @entity117 mp for @entity9 ’s @entity118 , urged the @entity90 to replace the governing body at the academy			0
calling for a full inquiry , he said : ‘ local council officers have taken their eye off the ball			0
the council has allowed these governors to take over these schools under the radar			0
’ at another successful primary school , @entity130 , similar tactics are being used according to the @entity64			2
headteacher @entity133 is under ‘ non-stop attack ’ by radical members of the governing body , teachers said			2
similar techniques were used to oust former head @entity138 20 years ago			2
mrs @entity138 said she was ‘ an example of how the plan worked perfectly ’ .			0

the school claimed sum , but the *equipment* is worth far less , it is alleged
it is at centre of a storm surrounding ' plot ' to oust @entity151 teachers
education chiefs are now investigating @entity8
