real estate mogul and ' @entity2 ' star @entity1 is n't running for president yet , but he is sounding more and more like someone who believes there 's a path to the @entity8 opening up before him			1
' i can tell you there 's a very substantial chance i will ( run ) , ' @entity1 told @entity14 in an interview monday before he spoke at an event hosted by the @entity17 of @entity18			1
but ' i do n't want to put a number on it , ' he said , when asked whether the chance of a @entity1 candidacy was better than 50 - 50			1
he is , however , lining up support in key early primary states and taking pre-emptive swipes at potential rivals , both classic behaviors of the species @entity29			1
next month @entity1 will appear at three separate events in @entity31 , one of the three marquee states whose @entity35 voters will anoint a front - runner in the 2016 presidential nomination contest			1
ready for @entity38 : @entity1 's no - holds - barred style draws massive crowds , and he insists his hair is all - natural @entity42 : @entity1 claimed conservative @entity35 sen. @entity35 ' has a problem because he was born in @entity44 , ' raising the specter of a new birther controversy one of those speaking engagements will be a ' freedom summit ' where he will jockey for stage time with @entity51 gov. @entity50 , @entity53 sen. @entity35 , former neurosurgeon @entity54 , former @entity56 house speaker @entity55 , former @entity58 gov. @entity57 , former @entity60 @entity56 sen. @entity59 , former @entity56 ambassador @entity61 and former @entity63 ceo @entity62 – all names familiar to those in the 2016 campaign - watching business			1
sources tell @entity14 that @entity1 also has political events lined up in @entity69 and @entity70 – the other two crucial early primary states – although they have n't yet been announced publicly			1
' everybody wants me in there , ' @entity1 said of his nationwide support among @entity35 leaders			1
' i helped lots of people get elected ( this year )			0
i did lots of robocalls for people			0
everybody i did a robocall for won			0
' a @entity35 political operative in @entity31 said monday night that @entity1 is ' one of a kind , and that scares the hell out of a lot of people			1
' ' i do n't think he 's serious , but can you imagine if he were ? ' the campaign adviser asked			2
' @entity94 s * * t , would that be fun to watch			0
and he 's so rich he would n't have to kiss anyone 's * ss for donations ' ' he 's a loose cannon with a private jet			1
' during his public remarks monday evening , @entity1 reiterated that he is ' considering ' a run ' very strongly			1
a lot of people believe i 'm having fun with it , and i enjoy the process , but the country 's in serious trouble			1
' ' i think we need someone very good , very fast , or we 'll be in a lot of trouble , ' @entity1 said , scoffing at critics who say ' that i 'm playing games			1
' he said he would announce a decision ' sometime after the beginning of the year			0
probably sometime in march , april or may			0
' the billionaire insisted that he ' would rather do what i 'm doing than run for president , but i love the country more			1
' ' until i see someone i think is outstanding , i 'd be inclined to do it			0
' @entity14 asked him on monday for his estimation of six potential presidential front - runners , including three @entity125 and three fellow @entity35			1
former secretary of state and @entity56 senator @entity127 , he said , is ' a front - runner , but we 've seen that before , ' referring to her 2008 crash - and - burn at the hands of @entity132			2
@entity1 cautioned that @entity134 sen. @entity133 , another @entity135 , could give @entity127 her 2016 @entity137 moment			1
' if she runs it 's going to be very tough for @entity127 , ' he said			1
' i do n't know if it 's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination			2
i would say @entity133 is going to be competition for her			1
' @entity1 said he likes vice president @entity143 , but ' i do n't think he 's going to be a factor			1
' a @entity146 poll released monday morning indicates he 's right : @entity143 attracted the support of just 2 per cent of @entity125			0
on the @entity35 side , he had much harsher things to say – an indication that he has a primary fight on his mind			2
outgoing @entity53 gov. @entity153 , he said , will continue to be dogged by a 2011 debate misstep – the infamous ' oops ' moment – that saw him unable to come up with the names of three federal agencies he had pledged to shut down if he won the @entity8			2
' it 's going to be very hard for him – because of what happened the last time around , ' @entity1 said			2
then the knives came out			0
' i 'm a @entity35 but the last thing we need is another @entity164 , ' he said , referring to former @entity165 gov. @entity164			1
' and his position on immigration is ridiculous			0
' @entity168 : @entity1 predicted that @entity127 ( left ) , the early @entity125 presidential favorite , will face a serious challenge from @entity134 en. @entity133 ( right ) who has staked out more liberal positions ' @entity172 with a private jet ' : one @entity31 campaign adviser who works for @entity35 candidates said a @entity1 candidacy would be a blast to watch ' the last thing we need is another bush ' : the ' apprentice ' star jabbed at former @entity165 gov. @entity164 for his position on immigration that mirrors president @entity132 's @entity164 stands out among @entity35 2016 hopefuls as the most friendly to @entity132 's executive decision to guarantee millions of illegal immigrants a deportation - free two years until he leaves office			1
and sen. @entity35 might attract his own birther controversy , @entity1 suggested			1
' @entity35 has a problem because he was born in @entity44			2
he admits he was born in @entity44 , and i assume that 's a problem , ' he told @entity14			0
the @entity196 - born @entity35 's father began his life in @entity198 and later became a @entity56 citizen			2
his mother was born in the @entity56			0
that , say most quoted experts , is enough for @entity35 to satisfy the constitutional requirement that only a ' natural born citizen ' can be elected president			0
a @entity35 spokesperson confirmed that outlook late monday night , saying that ' sen. @entity35 is a @entity56 citizen by birth , having been born to an @entity56 mother			2
' @entity1 famously courted controversy by taking credit for @entity132 's belated release in 2011 of his long - form birth certificate			2
' i am really honored and i am really proud , that i was able to do something that nobody else could do , ' he said at the time , citing his own bush - beating with public questions about the president 's heritage			0
@entity1 later offered to donate $ 5 million to a charity of @entity132 's choosing if he would release his college and passport applications before october 2012			2
he explained this year at the @entity225 that he believes the president may have falsely claimed to have been a @entity228 national in order to ease his admission to elite universities in the @entity56 asked to think of a ' single nice thing ' to say about the president during a press gaggle after his @entity17 speech , @entity1 shrugged			1
' the one good thing you can say is that he 's a good campaigner , ' he said			0
' but he did it fraudulently because the things he said were n't so			0
' not a factor : @entity1 does n't expect vice president @entity143 to make any noise at all in the 2016 presidential contest @entity1 could n't come up with anything nice to say about mrs. @entity127			1
' @entity127 is someone i know very well , ' he said , adding that @entity245 and @entity127 ' are members of clubs that i have			0
' ' and it 's going to be interesting with @entity127			2
i think @entity127 is going to have some opposition			0
i do n't know if it 's going to be that easy for her to get the nomination			0
' @entity1 told a capacity audience at the @entity254 hotel in @entity18 that @entity56 's deteriorating economic conditions would require the next @entity56 president to re-think the nation 's economic policies			1
the real unemployment rate , he said , is n't the 5.8 per cent figure that the @entity261 claims			0
' it 's probably 20 per cent , ' he said , accounting for part - time workers and millions who have ' given up ' on the labor market			0
he also told @entity14 that @entity267 @entity125 ' recent release of a ' partisan ' report condemning the @entity270 's controversial terrorist - torture program ' was an outrage			0
' ' we paid $ 40 million for a report that should have never been even contemplated , ' he said , suddenly animated			0
' and i think it 's a great embarrassment to this country , to the @entity270 , to patriots			0
i think it 's something that should have never even been thought of			0
' he also said he constantly has to push back against reports that claim he wears the world 's worst toupee			0
' it 's legitimately my hair , ' @entity1 insisted , drawing laughs .			2

@entity1 has kept his *spotlight* hot and raised *smirks* by speculating about a @entity8 run , but now he 's *scheduling* speeches in early primary states
' a lot of people believe i 'm having fun with it , and i enjoy the process , ' he said during an @entity17 of @entity18 event , but ' the country 's in serious trouble '
he lashed out at potential opponents including @entity164 and @entity35
could n't come up with a ' single nice thing ' to say about @entity127 and insists sen. @entity133 will give her serious competition
@entity1 has flirted with running for more than a decade but has never pulled the *trigger*
one @entity31 political consultant says : ' he 's a loose cannon with a private jet . i ca n't wait '
