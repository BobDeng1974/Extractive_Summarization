the £ 2million police review of the @entity2 case will examine calls from psychics which were previously ignored			2
detectives are studying around 100 logs of calls that were discounted because the callers said they were psychics or had dreamt about the high - profile investigation			2
critics said the decision to include information from ‘ supernatural ’ sources was a waste of resources			0
crimestoppers set up an international number and sent the information they received to @entity25 , the @entity20 family ’s home force , and to @entity29 police			1
but @entity25 reportedly asked @entity30 not to forward information from psychics , or calls based on dreams about the case			0
missing : @entity27 aged three , left , and in @entity42 's computer - generated age - progression picture of how she might look now , at the age of nine some 100 call logs were not passed on because of the request , @entity44 reported			1
but they have now been sent to the @entity42 team reviewing the case			0
@entity20 's book about @entity27 's disappearance has sold nearly 400,000 copies and raised up to £ 1million for the fund to find the missing child			1
mrs @entity20 thanked supporters for buying her account of how her daughter went missing on holiday in @entity29 , which was published in hardback a year ago			1
she said : ' the book has done amazingly well			0
that 's thanks to the general public , and i 'm really really grateful			0
' not only obviously has it helped @entity65 , more importantly it 's got people engaged again			0
' there 's more awareness now , there 's more information still coming in now			0
' for a long time we had wanted to correct things that were incorrect , just so people could be better informed , and therefore the search enhanced			1
' her husband @entity19 added : ' it 's put everything in the right context			0
so much in this case has just been taken as snippets and taken out of context			0
' it 's a properly considered record of what we 've gone through , and @entity20 's done a brilliant job			1
' mr @entity86 said sales of the book , simply entitled @entity27 , are ' close to 400,000 ' and it may have generated as much as £ 1 million for the couple 's fund			1
a paperback edition with a new epilogue will be published on may 10			0
the information will be examined and entered into the police computer for the first time to ensure no detail has been missed			2
but it is considered unlikely that any serious investigation will result unless the leads are corroborated by other evidence			0
@entity102 , a former detective chief inspector with the @entity103 , said he was sceptical about the ability of psychics to help police investigations			1
‘ as soon as you have a high - profile case you get a range of people coming forward , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m certainly not aware of any case that ’s been solved by psychics			0
‘ you ca n’t waste resources no matter how emotive a case may be			0
’ @entity116 crime author @entity115 said in a @entity118 message : ‘ this “ review ” just gets stupider and stupider			0
’ @entity27 vanished days before her fourth birthday from an apartment in the @entity123 resort of @entity124 while her parents , @entity20 and @entity19 , had dinner with friends in a nearby tapas restaurant			1
the review team has sifted through more than 40,000 pieces of information , including files from the @entity29 police investigation and from the private detectives used by @entity27 ’s parents			1
it has identified 195 potential new leads , but @entity29 police have refused to reopen the case because they say there is no new evidence			1
mr and mrs @entity20 said the fact the @entity103 were reviewing the case had made their lives ‘ much more bearable ’			1
in a statement to mark yesterday ’s five - year anniversary of her disappearance , the couple said : ‘ it ’s hard to define succinctly how it feels to have reached five years without @entity27 – impossible , heart - breaking , frightening , exasperating , incomprehensible			1
‘ sometimes it feels like forever and at other times , just like yesterday			0
’ @entity42 said : ‘ we can confirm we are in close dialogue with @entity30 to ensure that all material in their possession – from any source – is shared with us			0
’ may 3 , @entity159 and @entity86 leave their daughter @entity27 and her two - year - old twin brother and sister @entity165 and @entity166 in bed in their apartment and head for dinner at a nearby tapas @entity163 couple check on them regularly and at around 9pm , mr @entity86 finds nothing amiss when he returns to their room in the seaside resort at the @entity176 in @entity177 goes to check on them again and finds the shutter slid up , the bedroom window open and @entity182 police begin hunting for @entity183 is officially named a suspect by police in @entity186 police say @entity27 's friends and family may have destroyed vital evidence in the first few hours after her abduction			1
september @entity193 make @entity142 and mrs @entity20 ' arguidos ' in their daughter 's @entity195 7 , 2008three @entity29 detectives fly to @entity197 to re-interview the seven friends on holiday with the @entity200 when @entity27 vanished			1
july @entity201 receives £ 600,000 in libel damages from four newspaper groups over ' seriously defamatory ' articles connecting him with the child 's @entity207 @entity29 authorities shelve their investigation and lift the ' arguido ' status of the @entity200 and mr @entity183			1
is she alive ? there have been no confirmed sightings of @entity2 since she disappeared on may 3 , 2007			0
the original @entity29 police team believed she died in a ‘ tragic accident ’			1
@entity20 and @entity86 have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead , and @entity197 police now believe ‘ there is a possibility she is alive ’			2
where is she ? there have been reported sightings all round the world , ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions			0
of those investigated , none have been confirmed as @entity27			2
who is responsible ? three people were officially named as arguidos , or suspects , in the investigation - @entity20 and @entity86 and @entity197 expat @entity235			1
all three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in @entity27 ’s disappearance			2
the @entity200 believe @entity27 was taken by an abductor			2
convicted paedophile @entity242 allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang , but denied he was involved			0
are there new leads ? @entity197 police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the @entity29 case files and the @entity200 ’ own private detectives			2
they have refused to reveal details			0
why was this not done before ? @entity29 officers were convinced @entity27 was dead and have admitted publicly that they did not fully investigate other theories , including many of the sightings			1
what else was missed ? police did not set up effective searches and did not alert the @entity262 border for 12 hours , allowing a potential abductor to escape with @entity264			0
even a basic check of the other guests at the @entity176 resort in @entity124 was not completed for 48 hours , by which time many potential witnesses had left			2
gratitude : the @entity200 thanked @entity42 for their review and the public for the support they had received for their campaign what about forensic evidence ? police did not seal off the @entity200 ’ apartment until 10am the next day , by which time the @entity200 , their friends , resort staff , concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence			2
samples were taken and tested for blood and dna but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive			0
will the case be solved ? @entity197 police want the case reopened but public opinion in @entity29 has not been supportive of the @entity200 and there may be little interest in raking over a five - year mystery which has already damaged the country ’s tourist industry			1
even if the case is reopened , the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after @entity27 ’s disappearance may mean the @entity200 will never know what happened to their daughter .			1

it is five years since @entity27 went missing in @entity29 at the age of three
@entity20 said the family were ' probably as positive ' as they had been in a long time about finding their daughter
@entity103 released a new age - progression picture of @entity27 last week
