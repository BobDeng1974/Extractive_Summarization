yes , miss : @entity0 said that failing to stretch students does ‘ no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds ’ in particular schools that attempt to make learning ‘ relevant ’ or ‘ accessible ’ rather than concentrating on ‘ challenge and rigour ’ are just patronising pupils , a leading head teacher will warn today			1
@entity0 , an adviser to @entity10 , said that failing to stretch students does ‘ no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds ’ in particular			1
this is because youngsters are deprived of ‘ potentially powerful knowledge ’ , which helps them get ahead in life			2
mrs @entity0 , headmistress of the @entity19 – the top independent for gcse results last year – is addressing head teachers at a conference at @entity23 , a charity that helps teachers rediscover their passion for subjects			1
she will point out that at the institute ’s first leadership conference in 2011 , everyone agreed the best way to attain achievement is to ‘ ensure that high quality education is there for everyone			2
’ she will add : ‘ because if challenge and rigour in teaching and learning are not there for all , not only is it harder for universities and employers to find applicants with the required levels of knowledge and skills , but we do no favours to those from disadvantaged backgrounds by depriving them of potentially powerful knowledge – quite the opposite of government intentions			0
‘ to provide young people just with what is regarded as " relevant " or " accessible " is patronising and presumes to place a limit on their capacity for learning			0
it does nothing to enhance life prospects			0
‘ the purpose of their education must surely be to open our pupils ’ eyes to new horizons			0
’ teachers are not ‘ ill equipped ’ to do this			0
but attempts are being hampered by governments that focus on ‘ short - term results and favourable headlines about rising standards ’			1
she says : ‘ @entity75 has a strong tradition of liberal education that encourages independent thought , intellectual curiosity and cultural enrichment			1
‘ these values are in the dna of the @entity75 education system and we should not be shy about celebrating them			0
‘ the trouble is that we have educational policies dictated by governments who want short - term results and favourable headlines about rising standards			1
‘ while this may be understandable , given the huge investment of public money in our schools , it is also unreasonable in that the full effects of the education we provide may not be revealed until years later			0
‘ only then can we see whether our former pupils have become effective and successful in their work , fulfilled in their personal lives , and are making an effective contribution to society			0
’ clever clogses : last year , girls at @entity19 passed 98.1 per cent of their gcses with @entity106 or a * s , making it top of a league table for private schools			1
( @entity111 picture ) mrs @entity0 admits that the @entity112 has given head teachers more freedom and a revised national curriculum			1
she adds : ‘ so there is currently plenty of encouragement , in theory at least , for heads to choose their own pathways and priorities , and to determine their own aims and objectives to suit the particular circumstances of their school			2
’ last year , girls at @entity19 passed 98.1 per cent of their gcses with @entity106 or a * s , making it top of a league table for private schools			2
this was despite the fact it has ditched the ‘ too easy ’ @entity133 , with students taking an as - level in the subject instead			2
the @entity10 ’s @entity23 is a charity that helps teachers rediscover their passion for subjects .			0
