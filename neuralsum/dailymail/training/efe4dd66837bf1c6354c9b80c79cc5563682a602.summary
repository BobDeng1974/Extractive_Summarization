i want you to thoughtfully dissect your own reaction to these things			0
' please think about why you felt this way , why this image was so shocking , why you have no tolerance for it			1
' she highlights that she did nothing to violate @entity13 's terms of use			0
indeed , the basic guidelines on the site state : ' you may not post violent , nude , partially nude , discriminatory , unlawful , infringing , hateful , pornographic or sexually suggestive photos or other content via the service			2
' ' in our society , nude or sexually suggestive images of women are automatically seen as negative ' miss @entity0 continues : ' unlike the 5,883,628 ( this is how many images are tagged # bikini ) bathing suit images on @entity13 mine depicted my own unaltered state - an unshaven bikini line			1
