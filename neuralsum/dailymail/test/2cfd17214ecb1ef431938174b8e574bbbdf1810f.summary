finding discounted flights tends to be hit or miss for most vacationers , but one savvy traveler has managed to plan out an entire two - month trip that will barely cost him a cent			1
@entity5 , a 28 - year - old writer for @entity6 , is about to travel 20,000miles on 21 flights , stopping by 13 countries along the way in @entity11 and @entity12 and @entity13 while enjoying first class service			1
so he rounded up all his airline miles , and the points he had acquired on his 25 credit cards			1
in the end , he was able to book a vacation with stops in @entity24 , @entity27 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity33 , @entity36 , @entity67 , @entity42 , @entity45 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity48 , and @entity50 without having to pay more than a few dollars on any of the flights			1
he will also be in the @entity59 a few times , but just to catch connection flights			2
in the end he spent somewhere between 10 and 15 hours putting the entire trip together , which also includes free hotels , at a cost of 136,500 frequent flyer miles			1
' it ’s tough when you have a job and you have to ask your boss for time off , ' @entity53 told @entity82			0
' you only have a limited time off and then you spend a lot of that traveling			0
i figured while i ’m in a position where i do n’t have a 9 - to - 5 , i might as well take advantage			2
' in fact , @entity53 is such a pro at travelling on the extremely cheap that he even wrote two ebooks detailing his strategies : how to fly for @entity92 and how to @entity93			0
and the easiest way is a bit more obvious than many might think			0
' if your ultimate goal is to be able to find as cheap a flight as possible and go somewhere cool for not much money then starting with an open , blank slate and going wherever there ’s a cheap flight right now is going to be your best bet , ' said @entity53			0
the young man posts photos from his trips on his @entity109 account @entity53 is seen posing in front of the famed @entity111 on a previous trip , which straddles the border of @entity114 and @entity115 striking up a pose : keyes at a @entity119 wrestling match ( left ) and enjoying a hike ( right ) @entity53 poses while rafting down @entity121 which is located near the city of @entity123 in @entity24 wading into the waters of @entity125 in @entity25 , @entity24 , rock formations and the remnants of old geysers this strategy has certainly worked for the young man as he has logged an impressive 354,000 miles in the sky while visiting 30 countries over the course of his lifetime			1
this next trip will increase that number to 42 countries			1
' just gon na go to the market for a pig 's head ' : keyes at a @entity119 butcher shop ( left ) and camping on the beach ( right ) in @entity143 those credit cards meanwhile come in handy during those long layovers thanks to the access they provide to private lounges were travelers like @entity53 can enjoy free food and drinks , hop online and even grab a quick shower			2
' i ’ve got a nice work space , food , drinks , some @entity156			0
this is like this whole other world , ' said @entity53 during a layover in @entity21 , @entity160 as he sat in the @entity163 lounge			0
even better , @entity53 explains that the more you look for discounts , the better you become a finding and anticipating airline deals			2
' it ’s not necessarily easy or intuitive for beginners , ' he said			0
' but the good news is that because if you do a little bit of leg work — learn how to get a few miles and how to use them well — you can start to travel really , really well			1
