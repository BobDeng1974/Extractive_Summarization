by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 11 september 2013 what if you could send secret messages to someone just by touching them ? @entity6 has created a ‘ magical ’ device that allows you to do just that using a simple microphone and the human body			1
the @entity12 technology , which roughly translates into telepathy in @entity14 , turns the body into a human speaker allowing anyone to transmit messages through their fingertips			2
the whisper can then touch another individual on their earlobe and the electrostatic field will send vibrations through the ear			1
this causes the person touched , but no one else , to hear the message that was whispered			1
@entity44 , one of the inventors of the system , explained that the inaudible signal can be transmitted from body to body , using any type of physical contact			0
when a person whisper 's into the @entity29 microphone , sound energy is converted into electrical energy creating an electrostatic field around the whisper 's body			1
the whisper can then touch another person on their earlobe and the electrostatic field will send vibrations through the ear ‘ the @entity29 system includes a handheld microphone connected to a computer ’s sound card			1
‘ when someone speaks into the microphone , the computer turns the sound into a looped recording			2
‘ the recording is then converted into high - voltage , low - current inaudible signal that flows into a thin wire connected to the exterior of the microphone			2
‘ this looped , inaudible signal creates a modulated electrostatic field around the body of the person who is holding the microphone and can be transmitted from person to person via any sort of physical contact			1
’ the inaudible signal creates a modulated electrostatic field around the body of the person who is holding the microphone and can be transmitted from person to person @entity44 , one of the inventors of the system , explained that the inaudible signal can be transmitted using any type of physical contact bone conduction technology , which transmits sound through the inner ear , is n't new			1
special forces and police departments often use the technology , which allows headphones to operate without ' leaking ' sound			2
it has , however , recently moved into the mainstream with its use in commercial headphones such ' @entity105 ' as well as its use in @entity108 's @entity107			0
it 's latest use in the @entity29 system received an honorary mention at this week 's @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115			0
@entity6 said it is hoping to use the device to create ‘ magical ’ storytelling experiences at its attractions			1
a @entity120 microphone is connected to a computer ’s sound card			0
the microphone records as soon as a sounds of amplitude higher than a set threshold is sensed			0
the computer then creates a loop with the recording , that is sent back to an amplification driver			0
this amplification driver converts the recorded sound signal into a high voltage , low current ( < @entity135 , < @entity136 ) inaudible signal			0
the output is connected to the casing of the microphone via an almost invisible wire wrapped around the audio cable			0
when holding the microphone , the whisperer comes in contact with the inaudible , high voltage , low power version of the recorded sound			0
this creates a modulated electrostatic filed around the visitors ’ skin			0
when touching another person ’s ear , this modulated electrostatic field creates a very small vibration of the ear lobe			1
as a result , both the finger and the ear together form a speaker , that makes the signal audible for the person touched .			2

' @entity29 ' technology converts sound energy into electrical energy
when you whisper into a microphone , an electrostatic field is created
when you touch another person , the field sends vibrations through the body , allowing the person touched to hear the *original* message
only the person touched can hear the ' secret ' message
