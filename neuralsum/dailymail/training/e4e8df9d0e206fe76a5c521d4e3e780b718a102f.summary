@entity5 stormed out of the blocks and had the lead after six minutes			2
it was classic ‘ route one ’ as @entity2 chested down @entity41 ’s enormous goal kick , used his body strength to get past @entity66 and @entity63 and beat @entity58 with a low 25 - yard shot			1
@entity5 were rampant and from their next assault , @entity51 missed a golden opportunity to double the advantage , heading wide from @entity16 ’s cross with @entity58 flapping and the entire goal gaping			0
it did n’t matter as on @entity5 ’s next attack a minute later , @entity60 tripped @entity100 inside the area and referee @entity76 pointed to the spot without hesitation			0
@entity34 dusted himself down to send @entity58 the wrong way from the spot			0
@entity8 had not been without chances			0
@entity41 saved from @entity12 ’s looping header early on and then pulled off a superb double stop to deny @entity63 with his legs and @entity67 ’s follow - up with a remarkable reflex action			2
nine minutes into the second half , defender @entity13 equalised for @entity20 's side @entity8 thought they had secured a hard - fought point when @entity13 headed home the second half equaliser consequently , it was little surprise when @entity8 halved the deficit on 39 minutes			1
@entity63 marauded down the left , cut inside and fed @entity12 , who tucked the ball low past @entity41 to give the visitors hope before half - time			2
and the scores could have been level before the break , with @entity41 stretching his fingertips to push @entity12 ’s 25 - yard shot over the crossbar			0
equally , @entity5 could easily have restored their two - goal cushion when @entity51 found himself unmarked inside the box , albeit standing in an offside positions , but blazed over anyway			0
the @entity8 momentum continued into the second half and @entity8 equalised when @entity13 headed in @entity61 ’s floated free - kick to the back post after @entity41 lost flight of the ball			1
@entity139 's side survived a second - half comeback to beat @entity20 's @entity8 at the @entity1 @entity51 , on loan from @entity143 side @entity142 , tussles with @entity64 @entity61 puts in a strong challenge on @entity5 's @entity16 during their @entity147 fixture it was unfortunate for the @entity149 , who lost track of the deep cross in the floodlights , and rather negated all his excellent work in the first period			1

something had to give and the match swung in the balance as both pressed and probed			0
@entity8 substitute @entity69 stung the palms of @entity41 with a blast from 25 yards but it was @entity2 who had the final say as the @entity5 pocketed all three points .			1
