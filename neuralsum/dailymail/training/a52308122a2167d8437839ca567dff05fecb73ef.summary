as many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood last weekend as blizzards swept the @entity12 countryside leaving many ranchers ' livelihoods in ruins			1
and today their corpses still scarred the picturesque flatlands to the west of the @entity20 as the cleanup began			1
' this is the worse than i 've ever seen for loss of livestock , ' said rancher @entity42 , 25 , who works on his family ranch east of the town of @entity45 , as he began counting his losses			1
' some people were very well prepared and lost 50 per cent of their herd , ' said state veterinarian @entity49 told @entity50			1
' some were not prepared and took no losses			0
there was no rhyme or reason to it			0
' ' it will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact , ' he added			0
@entity62 , who ranches on the prairie near @entity64 about 40 miles northeast of the @entity65 , said he lost about 70 cows and some calves , about 15 percent of his herd			1

i ’m the eternal optimist and this is really bad , ' @entity62 , 60 , said			0
' the livestock loss is just catastrophic			2
... it ’s pretty unbelievable			0
' on top of the vast swathes of cattle killed in the blizzard , many also wandered off as powerful winds blew them far from their home pastures			0
nightmare : a cow lies dead in the snow in scenes more like an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a blizzard ' the worst i 've ever seen ' : @entity92 , 27 , left , and @entity42 , 25 , ride through pasture as they survey the damage to their herd ' we have misplaced cattle everywhere , ' @entity49 said			2
' the storm blew them 10 miles or more from where they are normally pastured			2
' @entity104 , 35 , who ranches near @entity105 , said a disaster program would be welcome			2
he estimates he lost 30 percent of his cattle , but wo n't know until he finds all of them			2
' we do n't know for sure how many we lost , but in the hundreds , ' he said			2
' it 's a tough deal , ' @entity104 said			0
' we 're hoping there 's going to be a disaster program			0
we 'll just have to see what happens , i guess			0
' sen. @entity115 , r - @entity12 , said a previous federal livestock disaster program expired at the end of 2011			1
lost cattle : ranchers raced to find cattle that drifted beyond fenced pastures during the blizzard october blizzard : this was the scene in @entity126 , @entity12 , as the storm dumped 33 inches of snow in @entity12 's @entity65 area last weekend the @entity131 and @entity132 versions of the new farm bill include programs to help cover livestock losses , but the two chambers have been unable to agree on a farm bill after passing different versions several months ago			1
until a new farm bill is passed , with a retroactive livestock disaster programme , little assistance is available to ranchers , @entity115 said			1
the @entity131 version of the farm bill would cover 75 percent of fair market value of lost livestock , while the @entity132 version would cover 65 percent			1
' hopefully , this will be the impetus to get the farm bill passed , to get people to the table , ' @entity115 said .			0
