the prime minister was speaking to children at @entity56 in @entity57 yesterday where he was grilled by a group of 11 to 16 - year - olds the @entity84 , which is set to open in 2014 , may be a state school but it 's unlikely to ever be considered ' bog standard '			1
while its admissions policy has not been decided yet , the policy is expected to be non-selective and community based			0
however , its community is set in one of @entity37 's richest postcodes in the @entity43 where house prices nearby average £ 1million			0
