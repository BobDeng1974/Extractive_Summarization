@entity1 coach @entity0 insists @entity2 will not be risked if they have any doubts about the @entity7 striker 's fitness after calling him up for next week 's @entity9 qualifiers			1
@entity7 boss @entity10 would have preferred to see @entity2 rested for the matches against @entity12 and @entity13 so the in - form forward could receive treatment on his hamstring			1
@entity2 has been in prolific goalscoring form since his Â£ 32million summer move to @entity18 but @entity10 revealed last week that the former @entity20 man was barely training for fear of exacerbating his hamstring problems			1
@entity0 , though , says he will not take any risks with the 25 - year - old , just like he would not with any other player			2
he told a press conference : ' when we call up someone it 's because we believe he 's fit to play			2
he 's been playing in all the ( @entity7 ) games and if he comes and is n't in condition to play , we wo n't force him , as has always been the case with all our players			1
' we always take into account the physical state of the players			2
we do n't force anybody , we 've never obliged anybody to play			2
' the medical team will decide on these things			0
' @entity2 has been in sparkling form for @entity7 in the @entity57 so far this season as well as @entity2 , @entity0 has recalled @entity58 and included uncapped duo @entity59 and @entity60 in his squad			1
@entity62 defender @entity58 has been drafted back in after missing the opening @entity26 qualifier against @entity64			0
@entity0 said of @entity58 : ' if he had been fit for the previous squad he would have come			2
i think it is more important that we have faith in him and he always been committed to the team			0
' ' we always look only at the sporting side of things			0
he has been with us for a long time			0
we will have a look at his condition and he will be useful for the team			0
' we think he has been playing enough and he has recovered from his back problem			0
he is a useful player for us			0
' @entity78 left back @entity60 is a new face for @entity0 in the @entity1 set - up the @entity1 coach also highlighted the versatility of the two new comers , forward @entity84 , who is on loan at @entity86 from @entity87 , and @entity78 wing - back @entity60			1
he said : ' they have both been playing very well and have been in the under - 21s			0
' because of @entity60 's qualities we think he can play either at the back or in a more advanced position on the left			1
@entity84 has also played on the right wing or as a second striker at @entity86			1
' both should be national team players for years to come			0
' two - time reigning @entity100 champions @entity1 , who beat @entity64 5 - 1 in their first competitive match since their miserable @entity32 defence this summer , go to @entity12 on october 9 and then travel to @entity13 three days later			1
@entity0 added : ' we need to be very careful because now it 's very difficult to beat any team			0
' @entity12 have already won in @entity107 and @entity13 are not the same as years ago , when you could expect to thrash them			1
we have to take care as they could cause problems			0
' @entity113 shares his concerns about @entity2 's fitness			1
