if things had n't turned out quite so magical during a trip to the @entity3 last october , this festive period would have been an agonising one for @entity4			1
the season of giving had been earmarked to talk honestly with his wife @entity7 about what the sport had brutally stripped away - and what to do next			1
' it was going to be the big moment , and whether i took a break from golf or even whether i stopped doing it altogether , ' said the 34 - year - old from @entity19			1
@entity20 poses with his wife @entity7 at @entity22 after winning the @entity23 @entity4 , pictured in action at @entity22 , is now looking forward to proving himself on the @entity25 @entity7 plants a kiss on her husband 's lips after his stunning victory on the @entity30 in early october ' my slump had gone on for so long it had got to the stage where i could n't keep doing it			1
my results were terrible , i was playing with people on the @entity36 who did n't know i was quite good once who were thinking : " he 's rubbish "			1
' now , thanks to his incredible victory at the @entity23 , he 's swapped all the negativity for rubbing shoulders with the @entity45 , the @entity46 and the @entity47 once more			1
instead of contemplating another profession , he can pore over the @entity25 schedule and pick the glamour places to play			2
' @entity51 will certainly have a different tone for @entity7 and myself , ' he said , smiling			2
remember @entity4 , the good guy who appeared to have the world at his feet ? back in 2008 , he was good enough to be a member of @entity59 's @entity58 team			1
the following year he finished seventh in the @entity61			2
how on earth could it go so badly wrong ? but it did			2
over the next four years his race to @entity68 ranking plummeted from 48th to 130th to 137th to 236th			1
@entity4 gets another kiss from his caddie after ending his wait for a win on the @entity25 @entity4 celebrates after holing a decisive putt for @entity59 during the @entity74 at @entity75 @entity4 , pictured in action at the @entity77 in 2012 , was forced to return to the @entity36 ' the low point was last year in terms of the way i was playing , ' he said			1
' i was not coming close to making cuts on the @entity36 , never mind the main tour			2
i was snap - hooking it off the tee and it was horrific			2
i was reduced to hitting a driver off the deck because if i teed it up it went off the planet			0
even hitting it in the rough was progress			0
' what happened this year might have been mentally worse			0
' i started to tee it up again because i knew there was no way back to the big stage if i did n't , ' he said			0
' i got my game back in ok shape but the transition of getting any confidence was horrible			0
my swing would look good on the video but on the course it was still rubbish			0
' that was when he put a big circle around @entity51 as the time to decide whether it was worth carrying on			0
' part of it was financial , ' he admitted			0
' i 'd made a bit of money during the good years but how long can you keep going when you 're earning nothing and it 's costing two grand a week to play ? ' basically , you 're gambling on yourself and i 'd lost that gamble for three years			1
how long was i prepared to keep on gambling ? ' @entity4 reacts on the 18th green at @entity22 after winning the @entity23 the 34 - year - old proudly holds his trophy after sealing a shock victory in @entity123 earlier this year in september , @entity4 was faced with the decision that would change his life			1
' i 'd got an invitation to play in the @entity127 , which was very nice of them , but i was genuinely in two minds as to whether to accept , ' he said			0
' i thought i might be better off sticking to the @entity36 and earning playing rights for the main tour that way			0
but i was n't really enjoying the @entity36 , so why not play in a big event and give myself a shot of adrenaline ? you can go on about the bad decisions you make and i certainly made plenty during my three poor years			1
but that was one of the best decisions i 've ever made			0
' @entity4 arrived in @entity123 greatly encouraged by some coaching advice from @entity142 , who runs his own driving range in his spare time and loves teaching almost as much as he does playing			1
even so , @entity4 had no great expectations			1
' if you 'd offered me a top - 30 finish i 'd have bitten your hand off , ' he said			0
' even when i led after the first round i was still thinking in terms of making the halfway cut			0
then i led by three shots after three rounds and now i 'm thinking a top - 10 gets me into the field for @entity155 the following week			0
' how does a player who has fallen all the way to 792nd in the world keep all the demons at bay , with the golfing world now enthralled ? his nearest challenger was none other than @entity164			0
@entity164 , pictured during the final round of the @entity166 ( left ) , was rooting for @entity4 @entity164 ended up finished tied second at @entity22 as @entity4 secured victory by just a single shot halfway through the final round , the world no 1 crossed a fairway to talk to @entity4 and tell him he was rooting for him			1
' that was so good of @entity164 , i think we all know he 's a class act , ' said @entity4			1
' but it was all the struggles i 'd been through that really helped down the stretch			0
for three years people had been telling me that what does n't kill you makes you stronger and , to be honest , i 'd never believed it			2
but it was true during those last nine holes			0
' at the 16th and 17th @entity4 played two of the gutsiest shots struck all year			1
the man who had never won on tour , even during the good years when he amassed nine runner - up finishes , was on the brink			1
there was still one more moment of agony , as fellow @entity196 @entity195 had a 12ft birdie putt on the 18th to tie			0
but when it slipped by all the emotion came pouring out			0
in the recorder 's hut he hugged his wife and the tears fell freely			2
@entity4 admits he considered quitting golf but he is now looking forward to a bright future it says everything about the popular @entity4 that a sport rose to applaud as one			1
' mind you , i do n't know what the guys on the @entity36 must have been thinking , ' he said with a huge grin on his face			0
as he says himself , in 72 fairytale holes , @entity4 moved up about five levels			1
instead of a visit to the qualifying school last month , he played in the four - event @entity221			0
not only did the Â£ 500,000 first prize wipe out three years of debts , he can look to a future filled with possibility once more			2
' i definitely feel capable of going further than i did , ' he says			1
' the standard has gone up massively in the three years i 've been away			2
it 's such an exciting time			2
' none more so than for the man who thought he 'd lost it all .			0

@entity20 won the @entity23 in october
he had endured a *nightmare* spell of form prior to victory at @entity22
@entity4 's race to @entity68 ranking dropped from 48th to 236th in four years
he admits he considered giving up golf but is now looking forward
@entity4 : ' i definitely feel capable of going further than i did . '
