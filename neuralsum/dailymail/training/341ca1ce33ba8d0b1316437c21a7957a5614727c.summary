hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive , the @entity0 said yesterday			1
cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment , allowing people to compare services			2
the warning comes a few days before a third of the country ’s consultants are expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics			2
hospital staff who do n't publish their patient death rates could face losing their jobs under transparency drive this week , for the second year running , the @entity0 will publish the death rates of @entity23 ’s surgeons			1
some 5,000 surgeons are thought to have agreed to the process - but another 2,500 have refused			1
sir @entity26 , medical director of @entity23 , warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five - yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses			1
last year ’s exercise showed that 16 surgeons saw patients die in 10 per cent of operations			1
one doctor , a vascular surgeon , recorded a death rate of 31 per cent - ten times the national average and 30 times higher than some of his colleagues			1
patients have the right to refuse to be operated on by a particular surgeon if they are concerned about their performance			1
sir @entity26 , medical director of @entity23 , said providing the information is vital to improve the safety of treatment sir @entity26 , who is himself a heart surgeon , said such information is vital to improve the safety of treatment			1
he acknowledged that publishing the consultant death rates was unpopular with many , but added : ‘ this is not going to go away			2
‘ we are looking now at a series of inducements , penalties to force that , ’ he told the @entity53			0
‘ on the personal level is the revalidation , there are also clinical excellence awards [ financial bonus ]			0
‘ if you want to progress with your clinical excellence award , if you have refused to allow your data to be published , then that will affect your progression			0
’ some surgeons have publicly criticised the @entity0 transparency drive as ‘ meaningless ’			2
professor @entity71 , a leading vascular surgeon at @entity72 , last year refused to publish his own death rates			1
he said it was a flawed exercise and that death rates do not tell the whole story			2
when a surgeon only carries out a small number of operations , a couple of deaths could occur by chance but they would skew overall outcome , he said			0
‘ it puts a huge amount of pressure on younger consultants not to do difficult cases which is absurd because many of those cases need to be done , ’ professor @entity71 said last year			0
‘ the data is fairly meaningless			0
there are other ways of picking up bad surgeons			0
the problem is that if you want information this data must be interpreted by an expert and that is not what has happened on this occasion			0
‘ we would prefer our results to be analysed at unit level , with a much larger number of cases albeit spread over a number of surgeons			0
’ but sir @entity26 said that the effect would stop surgeons doing operations for which others have better expertise			1
‘ we will lose some surgeons , ’ he said			0
‘ we will , and have as a consequence of this endeavour			0
professor @entity71 , left , who last year refused to publish his death rates and , right , health secretary @entity123 said that transparency over cancer treatment will help @entity0 improve its care ‘ the other thing that is more likely , and will help with quality , is that those surgeons who are doing just a small number of operations will think , “ i ’m not doing that any more ” , and they will pass on those operations to their colleagues			1
’ the @entity0 will also order hospitals to publish cancer survival rates from next year			1
every hospital will be obliged to publish its one - and five - year survival rates for breast , bowel , lung and prostate cancer			2
@entity123 , the health secretary , said : ‘ @entity143 remains our biggest killer , which is why we want to be the best country in @entity147 for cancer outcomes			0
more transparency in this area will help the @entity0 improve cancer care and learn from the best			0
