leading preps including @entity1 of @entity3 's old school back plan by @entity5 @entity7 's poorest children should be given priority places at all top schools , including fee - paying institutions such as @entity11 , leading head teachers will demand today			1
under plans that will dismay middle - class families who fear their children will lose out , sought - after state and elite private schools would be compelled to fast - track pupils on free school meals to the front of every admissions queue			1
the heads will say that independent schools should reserve about ten per cent of their places for poor pupils and waive most of their fees – or risk being stripped of their charitable status			1
free places : @entity7 's poorest children should be given priority places at all top schools , including fee - paying institutions such as @entity11 , leading head teachers will demand today popular state grammars , academies and comprehensives would have to allow children on free school meals from anywhere in the country to jump the queue over better - off families who can afford homes in the catchment area where prices may be higher precisely because of the school ’s reputation			1
the radical proposals have been drawn up by the executive of the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , which represents more than 28,000 heads and senior staff , and will be debated at its annual conference in @entity54 today			2
they have already gained support from leading independent prep schools , including the head of @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , the alma mater of the @entity1			1
@entity49 general secretary @entity63 admitted the proposals were controversial , but said : ‘ this would mean that parental wealth was no longer a barrier to getting children from disadvantaged backgrounds into the best schools in the country and it will narrow the attainment gap between rich and poor , which is the no 1 problem we face in education			2
’ controversy : @entity49 general secretary @entity63 admitted the proposals were controversial but @entity78 , founder of the pressure group @entity79 , said : ‘ i find this disgusting			2
if my child has every right to a place but is not eligible for free school meals , why should he or she be put to the back of the queue behind a child who is claiming free school meals ? what is the difference ? ‘ you have a hard - working family doing their best for their kids but they earn just too much and they lose out to parents who never get off their backsides to do any work at all , claim every benefit there is under the sun and get the place			1
‘ that ca n’t be right , and i am staggered that these head teachers can not see that point , because there is not any equality in that for children			0
’ the @entity49 executive ’s plans , which delegates are likely to endorse today , follow disclosures last week that several selective grammars have already chosen to use existing legislation to encourage poor children to apply to their schools			2
but the @entity49 ’s proposals go much further by urging politicians to ensure that all schools should offer places to the 1.3 million children who are eligible for free school meals because their parents are on benefits or earn less than £ 16,000 a year			1
fee - paying schools that can charge more than £ 20,000 a year for day places would recoup some of their costs from the pupil premium – extra government funding allocated to recipients of free school meals worth £ 1,300 per pupil next year			1
popular state schools that normally give priority to children who live closest to them , resulting in house prices soaring in the vicinity of the schools and creating middle - class enclaves , would be required to give places first to poorer pupils from elsewhere			1
poor pupils would still have to pass any entrance tests , such as the 11 - plus			0
mr @entity63 will today tell the @entity49 conference : ‘ looked - after children currently get priority in admissions			2
what if we extended this right to all children on free school meals , who could automatically go to the head of the admissions queue for any school their parents chose ? ‘ at a stroke , this would limit the house price barrier to good schools and secure more firmly the comprehensive principle of education			1
’ he said many private schools already provided generous bursaries to poorer pupils , and he hoped they would comply voluntarily			0
but if they did not , the government could change the law so they could lose their charitable status which allows them to reduce their tax bills			0
cost : fee - paying schools that can charge more than £ 20,000 a year for day places would recoup some of their costs from the pupil premium @entity177 , chief executive of the @entity178 , said : ‘ we have long been calling on the government to help hard - pressed families gain access to the excellent education our schools offer			2
‘ the @entity49 has raised a very interesting proposal that , on the face of it , we would warmly support			0
‘ if fees could be partly funded by a pupil premium from the government , many of our schools would be very happy to make up the difference through their bursary funds			0
’ @entity195 ’s head @entity194 added : ‘ i ’m very much for it			0
to increase the choice of parents about where they send their children must be good			0
’ but former private school head and @entity49 member @entity201 , of the @entity203 , said : ‘ this is social engineering that will result in unfair discrimination against anybody who does not fit the free school meal criteria			1
‘ it is an incentive for parents not to work in order to benefit from this positive discrimination			0
it should never see the light of day			0
’ delegates at the conference yesterday held a minute ’s silence for teacher @entity219 , who was stabbed to death in front of her pupils in @entity223			0
mrs @entity219 , 61 , was attacked in her classroom at @entity225 last monday .			0
