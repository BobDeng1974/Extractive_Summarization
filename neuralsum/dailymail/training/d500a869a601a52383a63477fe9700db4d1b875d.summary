by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today threw away the chance to become an mp within weeks as he ruled himself out of standing in a crunch by - election			1
opponents accused the @entity9 leader of ' bottling it ' and being ' frit ' after announcing he would not be the party 's candidate in the @entity16 seat of @entity17 vacated by shamed mp @entity18			1
last night mr @entity2 claimed @entity19 would have to resign as prime minister if he won the seat for @entity9 , but today he confirmed he would not be on the ballot paper			1
@entity9 leader @entity2 , speaking outside a pub in @entity24 today , ruled himself out of standing in the @entity17 by - election senior @entity16 will breath a sigh of relief at the decision not to field mr @entity2 in @entity17			1
the conservatives secured a majority of 16,000 in the seat at the last election , but bookmakers said @entity9 were just 2/1 to win @entity17 in a by - election , with the @entity16 favourites at 4/5			1
@entity37 frontbencher @entity36 said : ' i 'm not surprised that @entity2 does n't want to fight in @entity17			1
' he bottles it when there 's a real contest , and when he has a chance to prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and he 's done that again			0
' @entity16 defence minister @entity47 said on @entity48 : ' @entity49 is not stupid - he knows he 'd lose and runs frit from @entity17 ! ' but mr @entity2 claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would cause a ' distraction ' from the party 's bid to win the @entity57 elections on may 22			1
a by - election has been rumoured since the cash - for - questions scandal broke last summer			1
but in a statement outside a pub in @entity24 this morning , mr @entity2 claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run			0
' i have no doubt that @entity9 will throw the kitchen sink at this @entity17 by - election , but it wo n’t be me doing it and we wo n’t get that huge distraction , ' he told @entity69			1
' it was only 12 hours ago that @entity18 stood down so i have n’t had long to think about it , but i have thought about it and we ’re just over three weeks away from a @entity74 election at which i think @entity9 can cause an earthquake in @entity77 politics , from which we can go on and not just win one parliamentary seat but win quite a lot of parliamentary seats			1
' and for that reason i do n’t want to do anything that deflects from the @entity74 election campaign so i ’m not going to stand in this by - election			2
' i want to focus the next three weeks on winning the @entity74 elections and also i do n’t have any links with the east @entity88 ; i would just look like an opportunist and i do n’t think that would work			0
' the prospect of mr @entity2 standing for @entity57 emerged last night as he addressed a meeting of @entity9 supporters in @entity24 @entity16 defence minister @entity47 accused mr @entity2 of being ' frit ' , an insult used by @entity96 against @entity37 @entity9 strategists are examining how the @entity98 in @entity99 used a by - election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force			1
local teacher @entity103 won @entity98 's first seat in @entity57 in 1989 , and four years later the party overtook the @entity106 as the main right - wing party			2
other names in the frame to fight the seat are communities spokesman @entity9 , viewed as a strong media performer , and @entity9 mep @entity112			2
mr @entity112 , a former @entity16 , has been an mep in the @entity113 since 1999			0
but he has often sparked controversy , just yesterday making headlines for saying it was acceptable to dislike gay people			0
later he appeared to admit part of the reason he did not stand was he did not think he would win			0
he told @entity120 : ' i 'm not sure electorally it would have worked anyway			0
' the seat went to @entity37 in 1997 during the first @entity125 landslide but returned to the @entity16 in 2001			2
last night mr @entity2 told the @entity69 that if he stood and won mr @entity19 would ' have to resign ' but if he lost @entity9 would be finished : ' the bubble is burst			1
' the @entity16 were quick to seize on mr @entity2 's decision as proof he lacked the will to fight a difficult election			1
asked on @entity120 ' the question is have you bottled it ? ' mr @entity2 replied : ' yes			0
' conservative cabinet minister @entity134 , who represents the neighbouring @entity136 seat of @entity137 , said mr @entity2 had backed out because he knew he could not win			2
' i am not really surprised			0
whatever else @entity2 is , he is not an idiot and i do n't think he 'd have the faintest chance of winning in @entity17 , ' mr @entity134 told @entity141 's today programme			2
' i do n't think @entity9 will get anywhere in the by - election			1
' i do n't think the residents of @entity17 - some of whom i know because i used to represent some of the villages there - they 're not going to vote for a card who 's larking about trying to get protest votes			2
' it follows mr @entity2 also refusing to stand in the @entity154 by - election triggered by @entity158 @entity157 's resignation and in the @entity37 seat of @entity160 and @entity161			1
local @entity16 scotched suggestions of @entity163 being selected , saying they had already chosen businessman @entity164 to fight the seat			2
and @entity37 was at pains to stress that it last held the seat before boundary changes , and played down any prospect of winning the by - election			1
former @entity16 mp @entity18 speaks outside the @entity171 , @entity172 , as he announces his resignation mr @entity18 , an outspoken critic of @entity19 , quit the @entity16 party in july after he was exposed as having accepted £ 4,000 to ask parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of @entity176			1
he referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards and promised to quit the @entity178 at the next election			0
but the standards watchdog is expected to recommend he be suspended from the @entity178 for six months in a damning report tomorrow			0
in a statement last night , mr @entity18 said he was ‘ ashamed ’ of his behaviour			2
the former @entity185 colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it			0
he added : ‘ no point in shilly - shallying or trying to avoid it			0
what has happened has happened , i ’m ashamed of it			0
therefore , i ’m going to do what i can to put it right			0
i ’m going to resign my seat			0
’ the market town of @entity17 lies on the @entity198 in @entity136 in 2010 the @entity16 won 54 per cent of the vote , with @entity9 securing just 4 per cent @entity17 is a largely rural constituency which , since @entity18 was elected in 2001 , has been considered a safe conservative seat			1
centred on the affluent cathedral town of @entity206 and the market town of @entity17 , and dissected by the @entity198 , around half of the area 's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas			0
it borders @entity37 - held @entity210 in the north and lies to the north east of a number of @entity37 - voting constituencies in the city of @entity216			0

well over half of voters are employed , with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed			0
traditionally @entity16 , it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century , but swung to @entity37 after the war , with @entity246 @entity245 and @entity247 representing it from 1950 to 1979			2
it swung back to the conservatives in 1979 , with @entity16 @entity251 holding the seat until 1997 , when @entity37 's @entity253 won a slim majority as @entity125 swept to @entity255 could only hold the seat for one term however and @entity18 won it back for the @entity16 in 2001			1
at the last election , the @entity16 won 54 per cent of the vote , giving them a huge majority over @entity37 , who polled at only 24 per cent .			1
