@entity0 , 72 , who lives in @entity1 but is originally from @entity2 , is accused of stealing £ 124,000 from sick friend @entity3 a serving @entity5 councillor and former town mayor who helped to organise the @entity8 's first visit to a @entity10 mosque has gone on trial accused of fraud and theft			1
@entity0 , 72 , originally from @entity2 , moved to this country in 1970 and went on to become town mayor of @entity16 , deputy chairman of @entity18 , and was awarded an mbe			2
but today he was accused of stealing £ 124,000 from a sick and elderly friend as part of a fraud lasting for 15 years			2
@entity24 @entity23 was told that @entity0 began his deception in 1997 when @entity3 , a close friend of his who used to go to his shop and attended mosque with him , retired			1
mr @entity3 , who was then 72 but who has since died , wanted to return to his native country of @entity30 where his wife and children lived			1
however , he owned several assets in @entity1 , including two rental properties , which he wanted @entity0 to look after			1
on july 7 the former steelworks painter drew up a legal power of attorney which granted @entity0 the power to collect rent on the properties and maintain them			2
this paper clearly stated it applied to ' no other assets whatsoever ' , but some time later @entity0 is alleged to have created a handwritten forgery			2
this second document gave him access to all of mr @entity3 's stocks bank accounts , and pension			1
@entity49 , prosecuting , said @entity0 then used the forged document to sell all of mr @entity3 's shares , and withdraw his pension in cash every week			1
meanwhile , in @entity30 , mr @entity3 became aware of the deception in 2001 after he had trouble accessing his @entity57 bank account , mr @entity49 said			1
despite falling gravely ill and having to have his leg amputated , mr @entity3 began writing letters to the bank , urging them to give him control of his accounts back , it was claimed			1
however the jury heard that back in @entity65 had instructed the bank to ignore any letters being sent from mr @entity3 in @entity30			1
mr @entity49 said : ' his attempts to have his pension paid into his bank account in @entity30 were thwarted by the defendant			0
' pension payments were paid in to a new account and were being withdrawn by the defendant in cash on a regular basis			0
' eventually mr @entity3 tried to draw up a new power of attorney with his son , who lives in @entity79 , but this had little or no effect , mr @entity49 added			2
@entity0 has been a @entity5 councillor since 1983 , served as mayor of @entity1 in 2008 , was deputy chairman of @entity18 , and organised the @entity8 's first visit to a @entity10 mosque ( pictured , @entity0 third left ) @entity0 became a @entity5 councillor in 1983 in @entity1 while the fraud was going on , then served as chairman of the @entity90 and held the position of former deputy chairman of @entity93			1
he was also awarded an mbe in 2000 for services to community relations , and is still serving as a councillor on @entity98			0
mr @entity49 said : ' clearly he was and still is a prominent and influential person in the community as well as the @entity102 community in @entity103			0
' this meant people trusted him and were less inclined to check what he was telling them if he had not held such positions of power			0
' when police raided @entity0 's house in october 2012 they found the handwritten power of attorney , which was dated just eight days after the original was drawn up			0
however , it had a stamp from a solicitor 's firm on it featuring a name that the company did not adopt until 2004			0
it also had two signatures , whereas the law only requires one			0
mr @entity49 said : ' it makes no sense that a second power was granted just days after the first one when [ mr @entity3 ] had been so careful to limit the powers to just the two houses			1
@entity24 @entity23 was told @entity0 forged a will of attorney and used it to sell mr @entity3 's stocks , withdraw his pension , and access his bank account after he retired to his home country of @entity30 ' the second one is hand - written and there ’s nothing in it that says a legally qualified person had anything to do with it			1
and the legal stamp must have been applied eight years later			0
' @entity0 is charged with four offences of fraud , four of theft , one of forgery , and of obtaining a money transfer by deception			2
he is also accused of two charges of using a false instrument with intent , making or supplying articles for use in fraud , possessing an article for use in fraud and perverting the course of justice			0
he denies all of the charges against him			0
the trial , which is expected to last four weeks , continues			0
