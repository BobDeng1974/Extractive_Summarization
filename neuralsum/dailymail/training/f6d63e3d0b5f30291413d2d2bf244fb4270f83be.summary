civil rights pioneer @entity0 says @entity2 today looks a lot like the world she helped break apart 54 years ago : a nation with segregated schools and racial tension			1
' you almost feel like you 're back in the ' 60s , ' said @entity0 , who is now 60 years old			1
' the conversation across the country , and it does n't leave out @entity11 , is that schools are reverting back ' to being segregated along racial lines , she said			1
' we all know that there are schools being segregated again			0
' on nov. 14 , 1960 , @entity0 — then six years old — became the first black student to attend a previously all - white elementary school in @entity11			1
@entity2 deputy marshals seen escorting the then six - year - old @entity0 from @entity21 in @entity11 in november 1960 on friday — 54 years later to the day when she first walked up the steps to @entity21 — she commemorates that event with the unveiling of a statue in her likeness at her old school			1
also , she is reuniting with the white teacher who taught her and with the sole - surviving @entity2 marshal who walked her to school			1
her mother , who was adamant about sending her daughter to the all - white school , will be at the reunion too			1
@entity0 said racism remains painfully real today			2
she pointed to the tense events in @entity42 , @entity43 , after a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black man , revelations about racist comments made by owners in the @entity49 and how so many @entity2 schools have failed to become racially mixed			0
back in 1960 , @entity0 , flanked by @entity2 marshals , had to walk past a mob of jeering segregationist protesters and @entity55 flags to enter her school			2
one woman shouted threats to poison her			0
another woman showed up at protests with a coffin with a black baby doll in it			0
all the white students at the school were pulled from classes and teachers quit — leaving @entity0 as the school 's only student			1
@entity0 said racism was a problem before president @entity73 's election but that his presidency has fueled racism			0
@entity0 ( pictured today ) who integrated @entity77 schools in 1960 under escort from @entity79 , meets with @entity80 , who was one of those marshals , at the @entity82 ' race is a very hot topic right now , ' she said			1
she looks at her own experiences as evidence of a new segregation			0
for example , white students returned to @entity90 and the school became integrated , she said			0
she added that she went to integrated middle and high schools in @entity11			2
fast forward to today : the school now occupying the @entity90 building is 97 percent black , according to school data			2
in @entity11 , after integration , whites generally sent their children to private or parochial schools — and that preference continues today			1
blacks today make up 86 percent of the public school enrolment , according to 2013 data from the @entity104 at @entity105			1
she called demographic shifts since @entity108 — whites now make up a higher percentage of the city than before the 2005 flooding of the city — as evidence of gentrification rather than integration of schools and neighborhoods			1
she wondered why lawmakers and school officials ca n't do more to make schools more racially mixed			2
' how did we integrate schools back in the 1960s ? if those people did it back then , i ca n't understand why we ca n't do it today for the betterment of a community or for a society			0
' she said the key to a more integrated society lies with children			0
' kids really do n't care about what their friends look like			0
kids come into the world with clean hearts , fresh starts , ' she said			0
' if we are going to get through our differences , it 's going to come through them			0
' since the mid- 1990s , @entity0 has become a speaker at schools across the nation , telling her story and talking out against bullying .			2
