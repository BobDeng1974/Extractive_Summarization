from a potential heavyweight @entity1 final clash to @entity3 hoping to make history at the masters in april			1
and from the possibility of arguably the biggest boxing bout in history between @entity9 and @entity10 , to the prospect of a @entity12 on home soil - it 's fair to say that 2015 is set to be another massive year in the world of sport			1
here , @entity17 's reporters pick the golden ticket moments that they are hoping to see in the next 12 months			2
@entity19 imagine ... the first @entity21 derby , with a @entity22 vs @entity23 shoot - out in the @entity26 final in @entity27 and a place in the @entity1 2015/16 at stake , in the magnificent stadium where they forgot to close the roof when @entity33 played @entity34 in 2012 and had to delay the game for 24 hours			1
@entity37 's @entity22 side dropped into the @entity26 after exiting the @entity1 group they could face rivals @entity23 at some stage in the competition after they finished top of their group @entity46 @entity47 vs @entity48 , hopefully in the @entity1 final in @entity50			1
of course , if @entity52 can kick on and build on their domestic dominance , then it would be intriguing to see an @entity33 side take on @entity55 ’s best			2
but the top two sides in the world right now look to be real and @entity48 – and they probably have the two finest coaches as well			1
last year @entity59 completely outwitted an uncharacteristically indecisive @entity60			2
this year @entity61 will be ready			0
one team boasts the core of the world champions while the other has @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
@entity69 and @entity70 have swapped sides			0
when football clubs playing this well meet , the result ought to be something special			0
@entity66 finishes past @entity76 during @entity47 's @entity1 semi-final victory over @entity48 in april this year			1
@entity47 won the second leg 4 - 0 and 5 - 0 in the tie on aggregate @entity82 , @entity76 and @entity69 console each other after being beaten by @entity47 @entity83 it ’s always a privilege to cover the masters but it will be even more so next april with @entity3 trying to win his third major in a row and become just the sixth golfer to complete the career @entity90 at the age of just 25			1
@entity3 will be hoping to build on his major successes at the masters in april			1
@entity93 there is much to look forward to in 2015 , which could see @entity96 win the @entity97 for a staggering tenth time			0
or , given the uncertainties surrounding his health , it could be the year when @entity103 defeats him there to complete his own collection of @entity90			1
if these two meet in @entity109 in the @entity110 it will be one of the all - time heavyweight clashes in tennis			0
@entity96 could be set to win an unprecedent 10th @entity97 title in 2015 @entity115 @entity9 vs @entity10 in may , followed by the winner vs @entity117 in september in boxing great things go in pairs			1
the world has waited seemingly an eternity to see the @entity123 man and the @entity10 in the richest fight in ring history			1
@entity126 has been kept waiting ages to fight one of them			2
may they get it on , then on again in 2015			0
@entity134 @entity133 - @entity132 @entity9 - @entity10 , even if it has taken far too long to make			1
the build - up would be immense but i suspect i 'd struggle to get away from the thought that it should have happened four or five years ago			0
neither man is the force he was , particularly @entity10 , so whatever follows would come with a little regret			1
would i want to miss it ? no chance			0
@entity9 could finally be set to face @entity10 in 2015 the fight would be the richest and one of the biggest in the history of boxing @entity149 @entity151 ’s attempt to become the first horse to win the @entity153 three times on the first sunday of october at @entity155			1
trainer @entity156 never lost faith in her wonder filly despite three defeats in the run - up to her emphatic second success under veteran jockey @entity162 , who had controversially replaced @entity163 , no 1 jockey to @entity151 ’s owner @entity164			0
after the second @entity166 , @entity151 ’s retirement was announced but the decision was reversed as @entity168 convinced the @entity164 that @entity151 could make @entity169 will be cheering her on and @entity170 , on the one day of the year the track comes alive , should be throbbing			0
@entity162 , riding @entity151 ( centre ) , celebrates after crossing the line to win 2013 @entity166 @entity174 without meaning to go all @entity176 and prattle on pretentiously , rugby is a game that thrives on ancient and long - fought rivalries and @entity179 will be a seething pit of fire and song on september 29			0
wales have recently made a habit of humiliating @entity33 in the @entity185 and it ’s about time @entity186 wreaked their revenge on the grandest stage of all			0
oh , and it ’s time to teach them a lesson for trying to get the game staged in @entity183 too ! @entity33 and @entity183 are set to face each other in the @entity12 group stage in september @entity196 yes , he may have won it seven times before			2
and yes , he may have won 17 @entity90 in total			1
but for @entity200 to come so close to another @entity202 title last july and fall to @entity103 at the final hurdle was agonising to watch			2
to see old master lift the famous trophy just one more time in 2015 would be a fantastic moment that he deserves following his impressive resurgence in form			0
if not then i guess @entity209 would do instead !			0
@entity200 lifted his most recent @entity202 title and @entity90 trophy in 2012 @entity213 @entity3 dominated golf in 2014 but nobody was as consistent at the majors as @entity217			1
the colourful @entity218 finished in the top five at the masters , the @entity97 , the @entity221 and the @entity222 but failed to lift a single trophy			2
@entity217 took his game to a new level this year and has the potential to get even better next season			2
a major victory on home soil , ideally at @entity230 in june , would be ideal			0
@entity217 will be targeting his first major win next year after a breakthrough season in 2014			0

@entity47 v @entity48 is a potential dream @entity1 final
@entity3 will be hoping for a career @entity90 at the masters in april
@entity22 and @entity23 are both aiming for @entity26 glory
@entity9 could be set to fight @entity10 in may
