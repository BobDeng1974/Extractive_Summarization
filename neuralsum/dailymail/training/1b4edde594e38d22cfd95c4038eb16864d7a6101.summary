by @entity0 and @entity1 the annoying whirr of windscreen wipers may soon be a thing of the past			2
@entity6 is designing a sports car that uses a system adapted from fighter jets to keep a driver ’s vision clear in bad weather without the need for blades			1
it is believed to involve high - frequency sound waves similar to those used by dentists for removing plaque from patients ’ teeth			2
the @entity23 firm , based in @entity24 , is developing the method for its new supercar , expected to roll off the production line in 2015			1
wave goodbye : a new wiper - free windscreen is being developed which will mean drivers will no longer have to face the problem of wipers sticking to windscreens in cold weather @entity23 car maker @entity6 is remaining tight - lipped on the plans and refusing to reveal how the system will work because it says rivals may steal the idea			1
however , experts suggest it may make use of ultrasound to create tiny vibrations on the screen which would bounce off rain , insects and mud			1
it would also improve visibility and prevent the problem drivers face when wiper blades freeze to the glass in cold weather			2
the @entity56 - based firm 's chief designer @entity54 told @entity57 that the system was already being used by the military			1
' it took a lot of effort to get this out of a source in the military			0
i asked why you do n't see wipers on some aircraft on when they are coming in at very low levels for landing			0
' i was told that it 's not a coating on the surface but a high frequency electronic system that never fails and is constantly active			2
nothing will attach to the windscreen			0
' the system is expected to be introduced to @entity6 's range of sportscars which cost between £ 170,000 and £ 870,000 , but once perfected could be produced for the mass market for as little as £ 10			1
@entity84 , professor of ultrasonics at @entity87 's faculty of engineering , told @entity57 : ' the obvious way of doing it is to have an ultrasonic transducer in the corner of the windscreen that would excite waves at around @entity95 to bounce across the windscreen			0
' windscreen wipers were invented in by the @entity99 property developer @entity98 who received a patent for her window cleaning device in 1903			0
the invention came about during a trip to @entity104			0
it was raining heavily and mrs @entity98 noticed that drivers had to open the windows of their cars in order to see out of them			0
she wanted to find a solution and invented a swinging arm device with a rubber blade that was operated by the driver from within the vehicle using a lever			0
at first the invention was highly critiqued as many claimed that the device would actually distract drivers , but by 1916 windscreen wipers had become standard on most vehicles @entity56 - based firm @entity6 is remaining tight - lipped on the plans and refusing to reveal how the system will work			1
pictured here is @entity6 's new @entity127 car			1

@entity130 - based firm says system could make humble car wiper extinct
if *successful* the screens could be adapted *quickly* for mass use
@entity6 is refusing to reveal how the system will work
experts suggest it makes use of ultrasound to create tiny vibrations
