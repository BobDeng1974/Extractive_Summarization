@entity0 has come under fire for allowing users to download a game from its app store encouraging hunters to shoot dead naked homosexuals			1
the technology giant has removed @entity8 from its app store , @entity9 , after it was downloaded more than 10,000 times			1
sickeningly , it encouraged users : ' your mission is to kill as many gays as possible ' before advancing to the next level			1
on its listing on @entity9 , the game 's provider is listed as @entity29 , though the company denies ever producing such content			1
it has been removed from @entity9 since being listed on november 5 , but can still be downloaded on other app sites for free			1
in its description , it says : ' gays may be hidden in bushes and unexpectedly catch you			2
' remember ! when they catch you they will do with you whatever they want			0
' a score of disgusted internet users commented on the game 's content in the review section before it was taken off the website			1
' this developer is despicable			0
i can not comprehend how someone could create a " game " so wilfully ignorant , hateful , vile and violence , ' one user said			2
the app was downloaded thousands of times before being removed from @entity0 ' do you realize that young gay men and women are attacked all the time , and your game could be the incentive for someone to act on their ignorance ? ' normalizing violence is never okay			1
by creating and publishing this ‘ game , ’ you ’re sending the message that you condone such violence			0
i will not rest until your developer account is deleted and you are laughed into obscurity			0
' others described the game as ' sickening '			1
gay rights charity @entity73 said the game could have a ' damaging ' effect on young people			0
a spokesman told @entity78 : ' its shocking that a company like @entity0 who pride themselves on cutting edge technology would feature a game with attitudes more likened to the last century			1
' this will be incredibly offensive to a lot of people			0
we 're glad to see they 've acted quickly to take it down but technology companies have a responsibility to help protect people , particularly young people from incredibly offensive material which portrays gay men as predators and with characters whose sole mission it is is to murder			0
' it 's an incredibly damaging message '			0
despite removing the app earlier today , @entity0 declined to comment on the game or respond to accusations of homophobia			1
@entity105 , from @entity106 , said : ' this game is a despicable form of homophobia which is nothing short of an incitement of violence towards gay and bisexual men			0
the ' sickening ' app places the player as the hunter in a virtual world where they are told to kill or evade homosexuals to win points and advance to the next stage disgusted internet users shamed @entity0 for listing the app on its play store in the review section of the site ' @entity0 have a moral responsibility as a global brand to demonstrate that they will not accept such frighteningly homophobic apps or games such as this			1
' @entity0 's silence over this issue is extremely worrying			2
' human rights campaigner @entity133 also slammed the tech giant for refusing to apologise for the @entity8 blunder			0
@entity133 said : ' it 's shocking that anyone would want to create a violent , homophobic ' game			0
' ' i 'm glad that @entity0 have deleted it , but surprised and disappointed that they have not issued a clear and public condemnation of it			2
' such a vile , violent inflammatory game clearly violates @entity0 's ethical policies , and clearly it should not have been downloaded thousands upon thousands of times before deletion			1
' i would expect @entity0 to issue a strongly - worded condemnation and apology			2
' their silence is baffling			0
' even when big companies make unintentional mistakes , even if they have had no direct control over the incident , they usually issue robust apologies			0
' i 'm really shocked that @entity0 have not done this			2
