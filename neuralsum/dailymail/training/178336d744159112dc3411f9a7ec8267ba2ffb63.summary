the magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot @entity52 by @entity55 fighters and claims by the group that @entity60 aid worker hostage @entity58 had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the @entity64 ’s shocking murder			1
