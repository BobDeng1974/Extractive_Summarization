they may not appear to be related , but hippos have long been thought to share an ancient ancestor with whales			2
but up until now , a huge age gap between in the fossil record has prevented scientists from confirming their theory			0
now researchers have uncovered 28 million - year - old molars of a great - great grandfather of the hippo which has finally provided direct proof of their link with whales			1
a great - great grandfather of the hippopotamus likely swam from @entity17 to @entity18 some 35 million years ago , long before the arrival of the lion , rhino , zebra and giraffe @entity23 is a view of one of the fossils that confirmed this			1
it shows an upper molar of a species known as @entity32 ' @entity35 ' means hippo in the @entity37 language and @entity38 after the discovery site			2
the species was about the size of a sheep , weighing in at 100kg ( 220lbs ) , which is about a twentieth the size of today 's ' common hippopotamus ' , a @entity45 giant			1
it may have spent much of its time immersed in water			0
@entity50 was not a direct forefather of today 's hippo , belonging instead to a side branch			2
but it lived much closer in time to the ancestor from which they both branched off , allowing for inferences to be drawn about the ancient animal			0
dental analysis led the team to conclude that @entity63 lokonensis and the hippo both came from an anthracothere forefather , which migrated from @entity17 to @entity18 about 35 million years go			1
as @entity18 was then an island surrounded by water , it likely swam there			0
the previously unknown , long - extinct relative also confirmed that cetaceans - the group to which whales , dolphins and porpoises belong - are in fact the hippo 's closest living cousins			1
' the origins of the hippopotamus have been a mystery until now , ' @entity81 , a palaeontologist at @entity83 's @entity82			0
' now we can say that hippos came from anthracothere ' - an extinct group of plant - eating , semi-aquatic mammals with even - toed hooves			0
until now , the oldest known fossil of a hippo ancestor dated from about 20 million years ago , while cetacean remains aged 53 million years have been found			1
the remains of a 28 - million - year - old animal discovered in @entity97 's @entity96 has provided an important piece of the puzzle , according to a study in the journal @entity102			1
it has been name @entity104 lokonensis - ' epiri ' means hippo in the @entity37 language and @entity107 after the discovery site			0
the species was about the size of a sheep , weighing in at 100kg ( 220lbs ) , which is about a twentieth the size of today 's ' common hippopotamus ' , a @entity45 giant			1

the anthrocothere , shown here , is believed to be a common ancestor to hippos			0

as @entity18 was then an island surrounded by water , it likely swam there			0
this means the ancestors of hippos ' were among the first large mammals to colonise the @entity18 continent , long before those of any of the large carnivores , giraffes or bovines , ' all of which arrived only about 18 million years ago			1
the modern - day hippo evolved independently in @entity18 , and is a creature truly endemic to the continent , according to the research paper			2
' we filled a gap in the evolutionary history of the hippo , bringing us closer to the point of divergence from their modern - day sister group of cetaceans , ' said professor @entity81			2

molars of ancestor , @entity32 , were found in @entity97
the species was about the size of a sheep , weighing in at 100kg ( 220lbs )
until now , oldest known hippo ancestor dated from 20 million years ago
@entity63 lokonensis and the hippo both came from an anthracothere forefather , which migrated from @entity17 to @entity18 about 35 million years ago
fossils confirmed that cetaceans - the group to which whales , dolphins and porpoises belong - are the hippo 's closest living cousins
