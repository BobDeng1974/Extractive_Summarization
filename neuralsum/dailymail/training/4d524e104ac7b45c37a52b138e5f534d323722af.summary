we ought to be ashamed : reverend dr @entity1 said the @entity2 had failed to invest in younger generations and now risked extinction the @entity2 is just ' one generation away from extinction ' , the former archbishop of @entity6 said yesterday			1
@entity1 laid the blame at the feet of @entity2 leaders who he said should be ' ashamed ' of their failure to bring youngsters into their services			1
his stark message was echoed by the @entity5 , who told the @entity17 that compared to the need to attract new worshippers , ' everything else is like re-arranging furniture when the house is on fire '			1
the most reverend @entity24 told the @entity17 – where leaders will debate how to persuade traditionalists to accept women bishops – that they spent too long ' arguing over words and phrases , while the people of @entity30 are left floundering amid meaninglessness , anxiety and despair '			1
@entity1 , who stepped down from @entity34 in 2002 , remains among the most high - profile campaigners for @entity36 in the country			1
he said : ' we ought to be ashamed of ourselves			0
we are one generation away from extinction – if we do not invest in young people there is going to be no one in the future			2
' the series of high - level warnings about a looming crisis comes at a time when @entity36 belief and the @entity2 appear under attack on a number of fronts			1
recent census figures have shown a decline of more than 10 per cent in a decade in numbers of people who call themselves @entity36 , and the courts have rejected a series of pleas from @entity58 for respect from the law for their beliefs			0
last month one of the country 's most senior judges delivered a further blow			0
president of the @entity68 sir @entity67 declared the courts are not @entity36 and ' the days are past when the business of judges was the enforcement of morals or religious beliefs '			0
ministers – who ignored the @entity2 's objections to same - sex marriage – have gone so far as to threaten the autonomy of the @entity2 by hinting that the government will intervene to force its hand if it can not bring itself to approve the appointment of women bishops			1
lord @entity1 's warning was delivered in a speech at @entity85 in @entity86 as part of the @entity88 2013			1
archbishop of canterbury @entity89 , pictured here speaking at @entity34 in @entity91 , said : ' the issue of how we support each other , and how we understand and confront violent attacks is certainly one of the greatest of our age ' facing decline : members of the @entity100 stand during a meeting at @entity102 in central @entity91 the most reverend @entity24 told the @entity17 that they spent too long ' arguing over words and phrases ' i am convinced that churches can grow , must grow and should grow , ' he told his audience			1
however , he said that going to church ' is not something that is natural to people in their lives nowadays '			0
but he added : ' there is so much violence , too many divided families , too little job security , too many young people with nothing to aim for			0
it is still the case that people are essentially looking for spiritual fulfilment			0
' the warning from dr @entity24 came in a document – also approved by the current archbishop of @entity6 @entity125 @entity89 – that spelled out the real danger of the @entity2 's collapse to the @entity17 , the @entity2 's parliament			1
ignored youth : @entity1 said that sitting in ' a cold church ' is not interesting to young people and the church should make a bigger effort to involve them their paper spoke of a ' growing wariness and antipathy towards faith ' , adding : ' put simply , fewer clergy are now ministering to a larger population and having to oversee a roughly similar number of buildings with fewer worshippers to pay for them			2
' further significant decline would make it impossible to maintain the @entity2 as a national institution , which is present in every community			2
' @entity2 sunday congregations are running at half the numbers of the 1960s , and over the past two decades @entity151 churchgoing has seen a similar decline			2
christian numbers are rising fast in some parts of the world , notably in @entity156			0
