' @entity3 was able to avoid detection despite all of our youth staff , including mr @entity3 , having had their criminal records checked			1
we have closed circuit tv on board all of our ships , including all of the children 's clubs , and our own rules dictate that a minimum of two members of staff are to be with children at all times			1

' @entity217 , director of the @entity108 's child protection consultancy , said : ' while nothing will ever excuse @entity3 's crimes , his guilty pleas are welcome as this should save his young victims having to re-live their ordeals while giving evidence in court at a later full hearing			1
