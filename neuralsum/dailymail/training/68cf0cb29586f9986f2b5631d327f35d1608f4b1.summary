@entity0 was facing a new multi-billion - pound bill to prop up the euro last night as the single currency teetered on the brink of collapse			2
efforts by @entity8 and @entity9 to thrash out a rescue deal descended into chaos as a meeting of @entity14 finance ministers scheduled for today was cancelled at the 11th hour because of lack of progress			1
more than £ 18billion was wiped off the value of shares in @entity19 in just 20 minutes when @entity14 officials also warned that a separate make - or - break leaders ’ summit today in @entity23 would also fail to end the crisis			2
today @entity9 's chancellor @entity25 warned that the amount of money available for a bail - out needed to increase to prevent the collapse of @entity31 's economy and further damage to the eurozone			1
@entity25 said she sees no ' better alternative ' to the efforts being made to protect the euro and added : ' if the euro fails , @entity37 fails			2
' @entity39 will tell the leaders ' summit today that a bigger bailout fund , help for banks and support for @entity31 is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe the @entity47 , to which @entity0 is a major contributor , made clear it is prepared to step in and boost the eurozone bailout fund			1
that would leave @entity0 taxpayers to carry the can for those countries in the eurozone which have failed to solve their problems			2
@entity58 said @entity47 funds should not be a substitute for a ' big bazooka ' deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order @entity68 @entity67 warned that any attempt to increase @entity0 ’s contribution would trigger a mutiny to make monday ’s rebellion on @entity37 , in which 81 defied the prime minister , look like ‘ a children ’s tea party ’			1
chancellor @entity58 has said @entity47 funds should not be a substitute for a ‘ big bazooka ’ deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order			1
@entity0 has already forked out around £ 12billion to bail out @entity81 , @entity31 and @entity82 through the @entity47 , the @entity14 and in direct loans			1
in @entity85 and the @entity86 there was fury at the failure of @entity0 ’s @entity37 partners to get their act together			1
@entity39 will tell the leaders ’ summit today that a bigger bailout fund , help for banks and support for @entity31 is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe			1
a senior @entity98 source said yesterday : ‘ at some point they need to get around a table and sort this out			0
there is still quite a lot to do			0
to say it is a mess would be a good description of where we are			0
’ to add to the chaos , @entity111 ’s @entity110 government had looked to be on the brink of collapse yesterday , after his coalition partners initially refused to make the cuts in spending they had been told were necessary to prevent @entity37 ’s fourth largest economy going belly up			2
a deal was eventually struck late last night , although there was scepticism over whether it would be sufficient to stave off further trouble			0
@entity0 diplomats warned it could take weeks to finalise plans to bolster the firepower of the £ 383billion eurozone rescue fund to £ 870billion – the amount experts say is needed to ensure the survival of the single currency if @entity110 , @entity31 , @entity82 and @entity81 default on their debts			1
former chancellor @entity133 warned today of ' great dangers ' with the possibility of a ' haircut ' - a cut in value of a debt - for @entity31			2
important ? members of the @entity141 attend a debate on the state of play of the negotiations of the @entity145 concerning the economic crisis lord @entity133 told @entity147 's today programme : ' there 's a very important aspect of this and that is something called credit default swaps - the insurance policies that are taken out to safeguard people , insure people , against default by sovereign authorities like @entity31			1
' one of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps			0
' that is one of the great dangers			0
' he added : ' i think the market has got very definite expectations about the haircut , the amount of money required to recapitalise the banks , and they are very focused on the amount of money for the bailout fund			1
' lord @entity133 also claimed some countries would fail to ever become ' fully competitive ' in the future			0
he said : ' i hope that they will manage to satisfy the markets and buy some time			0
' i personally think the long - term future of the euro will be argued about for some time to come because the strains there are so immense i do n't believe that the southern @entity192 countries in the long run can ever really become fully competitive			0
' credit ratings issued by @entity195 a week ago riot police battle protesters fighting anti-austerity measures in @entity199 , @entity31 last week as the nation battles to get its economy under control @entity0 taxpayers could be hit indirectly , as eurozone officials indicated that the @entity47 could host a new fund to extend loans to governments at risk			1
@entity0 will have to pay 4.5 per cent of any @entity47 contribution			1
‘ the @entity47 has indicated that they are considering it , ’ one eurozone official said			2
‘ the @entity47 is a possibility – they could be one of the investors , they could be the host of this fund			1
’ talks on the plan are now under way between the eurozone and the @entity47 ’s @entity8 chief @entity221			2
@entity86 officials said they would fight any @entity47 involvement if it let @entity9 , @entity8 and the other members of the single currency off the hook			1
one said : ‘ there should be adequate resources for the bailout fund but @entity47 loans should n’t be a substitute for action from the eurozone			1
’ @entity68 mp @entity233 said : ‘ it ’s totally unacceptable			0
it ’s going to be no good the government bragging that we ’re not contributing to a euro bailout when we are going to be contributing by the back door through the @entity47			2
‘ if @entity58 comes to the @entity241 to increase @entity0 ’s contribution to the @entity47 , it will make monday ’s night ’s rebellion look like a children ’s tea party			1
‘ we did n’t join the euro because we knew it would be a disaster			0
there ’s no way the @entity0 taxpayer should be bailing them out			2
they should get their own house in order			0
’ @entity39 is due in @entity23 today for a summit of all 27 @entity14 leaders before a meeting of only eurozone leaders , at which an outline solution may be thrashed out			0
but the cancellation of the finance ministers ’ meeting means there is no prospect at all of completing the detailed number - crunching necessary to calm the markets			1
the @entity271 rose as high as 5548 in early trading in @entity19 yesterday but crashed as low as 5466 after the finance ministers ’ meeting was cancelled			1
nearly 70 points – or around £ 18billion – was lost in a matter of minutes before the @entity271 clawed back some of the rout to close down 22.52 at 5525.54			0
shares across @entity37 and in the @entity278 were also on the slide			0
@entity280 , a trader at @entity281 in @entity19 , said the cancellation of the finance ministers ’ meeting ‘ sent shivers through world markets ’			1
by @entity286 the @entity287 yesterday dismissed chaotic efforts to save the eurozone from financial meltdown as a temporary solution to the region ’s woes			0
governor sir @entity294 said long - term issues such as towering levels of debt and structurally weak economies still needed to be tackled			0
‘ the aim of the measures to be introduced over the next few days is to create a year or possibly two years ’ breathing space , ’ he said			0
‘ the underlying problems still have to be resolved			0
’ it came as a grand plan to solve the escalating debt crisis was thrown into doubt after today ’s meeting of @entity37 finance ministers was cancelled			1
debt delay : sir @entity294 said the ' grand plan ' to solve the crisis was only a temporary solution the ruling coalition in @entity110 , led by @entity111 , also appeared to be in danger of collapse as it struggles to cut its debts and boost economic growth			0
@entity37 leaders including @entity0 prime minister @entity39 , @entity8 president @entity319 and @entity9 chancellor @entity25 will still meet in @entity23			1
but the postponement of the finance ministers summit – due to be attended by @entity58 – suggested that a ‘ big bazooka ’ deal remains elusive			1
@entity294 said the crisis in the eurozone , and slowdown in the global economy , was deeply damaging to the @entity0 economy and its efforts to rebalance away from debt - fuelled domestic spending to exports and investment			2
‘ the international picture is highly relevant because going through a rebalancing , we are not looking to domestic consumption to try for a recovery , we are looking at exports , ’ @entity294 told mps on the @entity335			0
‘ and the world economy had actually become quite encouraging , then the situation changed			0
’ the euro and stock markets on both sides of the @entity345 dived on fears that plans to save the single area bloc from catastrophe will unravel			0
leaders are at loggerheads over two key elements of the plan – reducing @entity31 ’s massive debts to save it from collapse and boosting the firepower of the bailout fund			1
‘ it is a real mess once again , ’ said a euro official			0
@entity37 has broadly agreed that the weakest banks in the region need to raise nearly £ 100bn of extra funds to shield them from the crisis			0
but negotiations to increase the size of the £ 383bn war chest designed to protect countries like @entity110 and @entity368 from a @entity31 - style meltdown are in the balance			2
banks and other private investors are also resisting plans to increase their losses – or the ‘ haircut ’ – on @entity31 debt from 21pc to as much as 60pc			2
