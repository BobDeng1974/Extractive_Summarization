you would think it would take a bit more than @entity4 charm to talk your way past security and into $ 25,000 seats at the @entity8			1
but that 's exactly what a pair of @entity12 fans from the @entity13 managed to do for the main event at the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , on sunday			1
@entity19 from @entity20 and @entity21 from @entity22 had made the 5,000 mile trip hoping their team would take the title against the @entity27 - and they 'd be there to see it			1
scroll down for audio @entity19 ( right ) and @entity21 could n't believe it when they landed in prime @entity8 seats the pair may have wanted the @entity27 to lose but at least their mascot was game for waving the @entity4 flag facing prices of up to $ 10,000 for a single seat , it looked as though their hopes might be dashed , until they decided to put their bluffing skills to the test			1
after getting interviewed by the @entity47 in an unsuccessful effort to try and land tickets , they thought they 'd try just walking up to the front door and seeing what happened			2
@entity19 gleefully documented what followed on @entity54 as the pair had an evening they wo n't be forgetting in a hurry			2
he told @entity58 : ' our game plan was to be super confident			0
' we just thought if we pretend we belong there , nobody will question us			0
' between one layer of security and another we just walked in behind these 20 first aid workers , straight up to the front door and hid in behind them			1
' @entity21 was looking at his phone , pretending to text me , as if we had just popped out to look at an email we got or something			0
@entity21 ( left ) and @entity19 even got free expert analysis from former @entity8 champion lawyer @entity72 ' we walked past another security guard that just was n't paying attention			1
we could see the field then , the stadium and the atmosphere was insane … i remember looking at @entity21 's face , we just could n't believe we got in			0
' to celebrate their incredible good luck , @entity81 tweeted : ' i fu * * ing made it ! ! @entity86 in straight through the front door ! @entity88 !			2
' and there was more good fortune to come after the pair spent the first half jumping from seat to seat when people had gone off to the toilet or for food and convincing the @entity27 mascot to pose with an @entity4 flag			2
during halftime they stumbled across two empty seats in the fourth row worth a cool $ 25,000 each , next to former @entity27 legend lawyer @entity103 , who finished his illustrious @entity47 career at the @entity12			1
@entity81 said : ' we spoke to this guy and told him we had sneaked in			0
he told us the girls beside him were in the halftime show and so would n't be coming back to their seats after halftime			0
' so we ended up in the fourth row , sitting beside a former @entity8 champion @entity103 who gave us a play - by - play of the game … it was pretty cool to have the @entity8 champion sharing all the details			1
' unfortunately their team fell agonizingly short , losing 28 - 24 to a @entity120 - inspired @entity27			2
along with a pic of him and @entity21 , @entity19 tweeted : ' getting ready for the long trip back to @entity20			1
hopefully i 'm allowed back home : )			0
' but at least they managed to find their way onto a @entity128 bus back to their hotel			0
' it was a good day of hustling , ' @entity81 admitted			0
' what seemed impossible came true			0
' they tried to score tickets by doing a television interview but did n't have any joy with that approach unfortunately for the two @entity12 fans their team came unstuck against a @entity120 - inspired @entity27 these are the astronomical prices they were looking at for a seat - had they been minded to pay for one			1

@entity19 from @entity20 and @entity21 from @entity22 sneak in to game
pair tagged along behind first aiders at @entity16
used them to duck right past security at the front door in @entity17 , @entity18
ended up in fourth row seats to see their beloved @entity12
even *enjoyed* play - by - play analysis from *ex-nfl* star lawyer @entity72
@entity27 won but the ' impossible came true ' for the boys
