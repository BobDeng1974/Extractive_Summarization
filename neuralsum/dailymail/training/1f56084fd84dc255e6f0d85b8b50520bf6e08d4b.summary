legislation has been introduced to strip suspected @entity2 war criminals of their @entity4 benefits after it emerged at least four are living @entity6 taxpayer - funded lives in @entity7			1
the @entity8 comes in response to an @entity11 investigation published in october that revealed millions of dollars in benefits have been paid to dozens of former @entity13 who were forced out of the @entity6 in a ' @entity2 dumping ' scheme			2
the legislation would end benefits for the four surviving @entity2 suspects who have lost their @entity6 citizenship , a step called denaturalization , but maintain certain perks			1
@entity4 guards : @entity24 ( left ) , anbd @entity25 ( right ) , who patrolled @entity26 , agreed to leave the @entity6 in a deal which let them keep receiving benefits			1
@entity24 lives in @entity30 now , while @entity25 is in @entity31 death camp : some of those the @entity6 paid - and continues to pay - were involved with the infamous @entity26 death camp in @entity35 , where hundreds of thousands of @entity36 were systemically slaughtered @entity6 law currently requires a higher threshold - a final order of deportation - before benefits can be terminated			1
a companion bill to close this so - called loophole was introduced in the @entity44 by a bipartisan group of lawmakers on thursday			1
@entity47 , a spokesman for @entity49 majority leader @entity48 , said ' we 're eager to get this done ' during the lame - duck session that will last until a new @entity53 begins in late january			0
the @entity11 's investigation found that the @entity55 used the loophole to persuade @entity2 suspects to leave the @entity6 in exchange for @entity4 benefits			1
if they agreed to go voluntarily , or simply fled the country before being deported , they could keep their @entity4 benefits			2
the @entity55 denied using @entity4 payments as a tool for expelling former nazis			1
' our bill will eliminate the loophole that has allowed @entity2 war criminals to collect @entity4 benefits , ' rep. @entity66 , the bill 's main sponsor , said in a statement			2
until their deaths : two suspected war criminals , rocket scientist @entity77 ( left ) and @entity4 guard @entity78 ( right ) , continued to receive @entity6 @entity4 until their deaths - in 1996 and 1989 respectively ' we should work in a bipartisan and expeditious manner to terminate these benefits once and for all			1
@entity84 of @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity87 joined with @entity88 to introduce the legislation			0
there are 11 other co-sponsors			0
' this is a matter of principle , ' @entity84 said			0
' taxpayers should not be funding the retirement of war criminals			0
' the @entity44 bill is sponsored by sens. @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 , @entity103 the @entity49 and the @entity104 have signaled support for denying benefits to former @entity13			0
the @entity55 said it is open to considering proposals that would terminate the @entity4 payments			2
' this legislation is long overdue , and we are pleased that lawmakers in @entity53 are taking this seriously , ' said @entity114 , national director of the @entity115			0
still taking the cash : @entity25 , pictured in his @entity31 home earlier this year , refused to answer questions about the financial arrangements overseeing persecution : according to internal documents , the government departments involved in ridding the @entity6 of @entity13 saw striking the @entity4 deal as preferable to drawn - out deportation battles in court the legislation specifically targets individuals who were denaturalized because of their roles in the @entity2 persecution or lost their citizenship through a settlement agreement with the @entity55			1
the bill requires the @entity55 to notify the @entity104 of their identities and locations so the agency can shut off their benefits			0
the @entity55 and @entity104 also would be required to submit a report to @entity53 six months after the bill 's enactment identifying the total number of individuals found to be participants in the @entity2 persecution and the total number of individuals whose benefits were effectively revoked			0
' war criminals ' : pictured above as @entity2 officers talking to @entity36 in the @entity149 - many of whom were brutally killed			2
a living @entity4 recipient - @entity152 , 93 - was part of the unit that killed them the @entity104 has refused the @entity11 's request for the overall number of @entity2 suspects who received benefits and the dollar amounts of the payments			1
the @entity11 in october appealed the agency 's denial of the information through the @entity166			0
the appeal also cited several concerns about the @entity104 's handling of the @entity166 request , including the agency 's decision to change the request ' in a manner serving both to undercut @entity11 's inquiry while simultaneously sparing the @entity104 from having to disclose potentially embarrassing information , ' the oct. 16 appeal said .			0

bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced law to officially deport them
suspects including @entity4 guards and @entity2 scientists got government *payouts*
continued to receive @entity4 as deals to get them to leave @entity6
after leaving , @entity6 suspects lost their citizenship - but kept payments
four men - @entity25 , @entity24 , @entity195 and @entity152 - are still receiving @entity4 payments today
