' do you want to see something that will make you feel alive ? ’ whispers my girlfriend			1
it ’s the middle of the night			1
forgive me , but i think my luck could be in			1
i ’m awake in a flash			2
turns out i ’ve misread the situation , but she ’s right about feeling alive			2
a storm has swept in from the @entity10 on to the @entity12 coastline and it ’s electric			2
wind swirls ; rain lashes ; blue - white lightning fills the sky			1
the cabana where we ’re staying is 20 yards from the sea , so we sit outside on the terrace and watch the show			2
@entity23 explores the off - the - beaten - path glamour of @entity28 's @entity27 coastline we ’re on the @entity28 coast , two hours south of @entity30			1
@entity31 is a three - mile stretch of sand			1
once the preserve of backpackers and yoga nuts , it now attracts a more chic crowd and bohemian film stars such as @entity39 , who wander along the beach nibbling on coconuts , waxing surfboards and snapping photographs of one another			1
the vibe is @entity46 meets @entity47 with a few ancient ruins thrown in			2
we ’ve booked through @entity49 and mrs @entity50 , staying in three different places			2
first up is @entity52 , where 100 or so cabins line a private beach			1
by day , guests congregate at the bar or lounge by the sea			2
primitive , but pristine , like an upmarket gap year			1
no sooner do i flop onto the sand than a wide - eyed @entity28 introduces himself as @entity64 and asks if i ’d like a contest of bat and ball ? sure would			1
after much prancing and pirouetting to boost our rally count , he slaps me on the back			2
‘ amigo , we ’ve earned ourselves a beer			2
’ with that we stroll up to the bar			2
this sets the scene perfectly			0
@entity76 is more relaxed than an iguana on a hot rock			0
locals like to call it ‘ off the grid ’ because it ’s funky			0
it ’s also disconnected from the mainland power supply , so do n’t pack anything more than a phone charger			0
at @entity52 , two hours south of @entity30 , 100 or so cabins line a primitive , yet pristine private beach perhaps unsurprisingly , bohemian - chic celebrities , like @entity39 , are also fans of this lush paradise the food ’s not bad , either			1
if you ’re after something authentically @entity28 , try the aptly named @entity94 , down at the south end of the bay on the jungle side of the road			0
whopping garlic butter lobsters and octopus with pea puree is the norm here , all accompanied by shots of mescal — tequila ’s younger cousin			0
on route , we pass small gatherings of people looking for mother turtles hauling themselves out of the ocean to lay their eggs			0
there ’s a strong conservation ethos here			0
if boutique hotels and @entity121 bohemians are n’t your thing , then try the @entity123 north of @entity12 on the @entity124 , where we stop before heading inland			1
as you approach , it looks like a @entity127 fort			1
it has an array of suites across a vast acreage of jungle running towards to the sea			0
it ’s so large the hotel has its own safari car to venture into the undergrowth , where you ’ll find birdlife to satisfy even the most practised ornithologist			1
do n't love boutique hotels ? try the @entity143 resort on the @entity124 we drive inland to the hidden city of @entity146 , a colonial outpost of @entity148 arcades and spas			1
here , the @entity155 peninsula was home to the @entity158 civilisation , a society highly advanced in art , trade , and temple - building			1
well worth a visit is the @entity161 perfumery , near the city centre			0
imagine an ancient townhouse where the @entity165 monks who colonised the @entity155 in the 16th century and concocted herbal remedies and perfumes			0
this is where @entity169 , who set up and runs @entity161 with his wife @entity170 , takes his inspiration			0
he spent years researching the monks ’ techniques to create a vast range of room scents , aftershaves and perfumes			0
in @entity146 , the @entity161 perfumery creates a vast range of scents , inspired by the monks ' techniques @entity23 and his girlfriend stayed at the perfumery 's sister establishment , located an hour away in @entity186 , @entity28 we actually stayed at a @entity161 sister establishment about an hour away in @entity186			1
the hotel overlooks a crocodile - laden lagoon and if there ’s ever a time to sport your @entity195 hat , this is it			1
@entity197 was once home to 100,000 people			0
a scattering of old structures have been uncovered , but 6,500 more are thought to be below the surface			0
for all the man - made wonders of the world , our most exhilarating experience in @entity186 comes from a purely natural source			1
cenotes , or sinkholes , are formed from the collapse of limestone bedrock to create wondrous cave lakes — we feel as if we are hunting for one of @entity215 ’s horcruxes as we descend 60ft			0
a deep pool greets us			0
as i dive in , the icy sensation shoots from head to toe			0
it ’s an electric grand finale to a thrilling @entity28 adventure			0
mr and mrs @entity50 ( 033 100 3180 , mrandmrssmith.com ) has doubles at @entity52 from £ 77 per night , room only ; doubles at @entity76 from £ 177 a night , and @entity197 from £ 140 a night , room only ( including price - match pledge )			1
@entity228 flies to @entity30 from @entity229 from £ 420 return .			0

@entity31 's 3 - mile stretch of sand attracts chic crowds and boho film stars
@entity52 offers 100 or so pristine cabins lined up along a private beach
while the @entity123 hotel in @entity124 looks more like a @entity127 fort
the @entity244 hotel in nearby @entity186 overlooks a crocodile - laden lagoon
