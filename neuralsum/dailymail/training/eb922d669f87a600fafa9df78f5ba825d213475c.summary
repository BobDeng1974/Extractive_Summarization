a fascinating letter by astronaut @entity1 prior to his historic moon landing in which he contemplated the words he would speak if the mission was successful has been unearthed			1
the letter was sent to a fan a month before @entity1 became the first person ever to walk on the surface of the moon on july 21 , 1969			2
millions watched live on television as he took his first steps and famously declared the mission was ' one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind '			0
the amazing letter was written by @entity1 and @entity19 just weeks before the moon mission the letter was signed by astronauts @entity1 , left and @entity19 , right @entity1 , pictured inside the @entity24 module was the first man to walk on the moon on july 20 , 1969 the words are among the most celebrated of all time and helped secure @entity1 's place in the history books			1
fittingly , in his letter to @entity32 supporter mrs @entity31 on june 23 , 1969 , @entity1 revealed he had n't decided on what he would say should the @entity24 moon landing go to plan but hoped she would be ' pleased with whatever message we do have '			1
@entity1 said : ' @entity37 and i appreciate your taking the time to write us for your suggestion on a message from the lunar surface			2
' we do not know at this time what our inclination will be should we be successful in our landing attempt			0
' i certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have and the impressions that people on earth receive from our efforts			0

' even before @entity1 , @entity19 , and @entity62 would lift off for the moon on @entity24 , people wondered what those words might be			1
' with the danger and uncertainty that swirled around the historic @entity54 mission , its success was more important to @entity1 and the crew than what words would be uttered			2

i certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have			0
