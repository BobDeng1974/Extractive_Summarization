the latest move by the @entity21 administration comes as the president tries to make good on a years old promise to close the @entity16 prison president @entity21 pledged to close the prison within a year of taking office but was blocked by @entity117 , which has enacted legislation that prohibits transferring any prisoners to the @entity1 mainland for any reason , including trial or imprisonment , and imposed rules making it harder to sending them overseas			1
@entity117 eased the transfer restrictions last year and they have resumed after a lull			0
the @entity1 has released 19 so far this year and more releases are expected by dec. 31			0
of the 136 still detained , there are 67 prisoners who have been determined to be suitable for release by a task force of @entity1 government agencies			1
some of these men ca n't go back to their homelands for reasons that include the possibility that they could face persecution or torture or because the @entity1 considers their countries too unstable to provide adequate guarantees that they can be monitored and kept from engaging in militant activity			2
the remaining prisoners pose the biggest challenge to any effort to close the detention center			0
they are a mix of prisoners who have either been deemed too dangerous to release or are at some stage of the process of trial by military commission			0
this last group includes five men charged with terrorism and other crimes for their alleged roles in the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack			0
their case is in the pre-trial stage and no date has been set for the death penalty trial .			0
