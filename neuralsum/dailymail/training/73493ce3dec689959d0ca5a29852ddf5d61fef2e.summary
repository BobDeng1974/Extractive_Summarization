by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:09 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 25 july 2013 @entity3 's economy is firing on all cylinders for the first time since 2010 after official figures showed growth has doubled since the start of the year			1
@entity9 hailed growing indications that the @entity3 is ‘ on the mend ’ as the @entity11 said gross domestic product rose by 0.6 per cent in the three months to june , after a 0.3 per cent rise in the first quarter			1
it is the first time for two years that @entity3 has recorded back - to - back quarters of growth and bolstered hopes that the country is finally on the road to a sustainable recovery			2
recovery : latest figures from the @entity11 show the economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2013 , but remains 3.3 per cent below the pre-crash peak in 2008 crucially , all four sectors of the economy – services , industrial production , construction and agriculture – grew for the first time since 2010			1
the chancellor said growth was well ahead of the 0.2 per cent forecast by the independent @entity36 at the time of the @entity38 in march – but warned there was a ‘ long way to go ’			1
the dominant services sector , which makes up three - quarters of economic output in @entity3 , was the driving force , as it grew by 0.6 per cent			1
but the smaller areas of the economy also grew			2
production was up 0.6 per cent , with output from @entity3 factories up 0.4 per cent , while construction grew by 0.9 per cent and agriculture by 1.1 per cent			1
the news left @entity52 – which has repeatedly claimed the government ’s spending cuts are strangling growth and recovery – in a difficult position			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ @entity3 is holding its nerve , we are sticking to our plan , and the @entity3 economy is on the mend – but there is still a long way to go and i know things are still tough for families			1
use your loaf : chancellor @entity9 meets staff at @entity70 in @entity71 near @entity72 ahead of the latest growth figures being released making dough : confidence in the economy is at its highest level since the @entity79 came to power , a new survey suggests ‘ so i will not let up in my determination to make sure we put right all that went wrong in our economy			1
‘ the people who should take the credit are businesses and hardworking families who have come through this period and we are starting to see the results			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity91 said that while the recovery was ‘ welcome ’ , it was still the slowest for 100 years			1
he added : ‘ families on middle and low incomes are still not seeing any recovery in their living standards			0
most people will be thinking , “ it ’s working ? it ’s not working for me			0
” ’ however , a poll by @entity101 and the @entity102 and @entity103 showed confidence in the economy is at its highest for more than three years			1
yesterday ’s figures also showed gross domestic product remains 3.3 per cent below its peak in @entity52 ’s debt - fuelled boom , and wages and savings rates are failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living			1
they showed economic output crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 as the crisis struck			0
‘ the numbers today confirm that we had one of the deepest recessions in our history , one of the deepest recessions in the world , ’ mr @entity9 said			2
despite the welcome figures , it is feared that an escalation of the crisis in the eurozone and the slowdown in @entity131 could yet knock the recovery off course			0
@entity133 , chief economist at the @entity134 , said : ‘ for the first time since the financial crisis the economy looks and feels as if there is a tailwind behind it			2
we are optimistic the current rate of growth can be maintained			2
’ budget pressure : wage rises are failing to keep pace with increasing living costs , making it harder for workers to make ends meet @entity152 adviser @entity151 said : ‘ this is very encouraging and qualifies as the right kind of growth that we have been lacking over the past couple of years			2
’ yesterday 's figures appeared to show that @entity3 is on the road to recovery			0
here the @entity162 ’s city editor , @entity161 , gives his view			0
it has taken a long time to happen but the @entity3 economy finally started to motor in the three months to june			1
the figures suggest growth is running at a 1.4 per cent rate on an annual basis – more than twice the forecast made by the @entity36 in march			2
even so , the @entity3 economy remains , along with that of @entity174 , among the worst performing of the @entity177 richest countries since the great recession of 2008 - 09			0
total output will have to rise by a further 3.3 per cent to return to where it was at the peak of the new @entity52 boom in early 2008			2
however , the really encouraging thing is that growth is gathering momentum with each successive quarter despite the drag on exports caused by the downturn in the eurozone			0
hit the road : at 00.30am mr @entity9 joined workers improving junction 7 of the @entity195 machinery of government : the chancellor climbed aboard the heavy plant being used to on the section of the @entity195 near @entity72 and even that may be taking a turn for the better with the @entity203 business confidence index climbing sharply			1
behind @entity3 ’s renaissance is a strong pick - up in the services economy , which includes everything from finance , to @entity209 and the creative industries			0
economic expansion is the result of tens of thousands of ordinary businesses having the confidence to invest and households having the courage to spend			0
it is significant that growth is now coming from all sectors , including industrial production and construction			1
there is a widespread belief among the economic analysts that the figures just released could yet be revised upwards to reflect the full scale of the improvement in construction aided by the @entity230 to buy schemes			0
meanwhile all eyes will now be upon the first press conference of new @entity235 governor @entity234 on august 7 , when he has promised to provide guidance on the path to economic growth			0
this is expected to include a long period ahead of super-low interest rates of 0.5 per cent as well as continued support for measures designed to keep credit flowing			0
@entity245 left : by 1.30am mr @entity9 was touring a @entity247 depot in @entity248 , where he saw goods being loaded on to a train to @entity251 a further sign of the improved conditions has been bumper results from some of our biggest enterprises , including aerospace engine supplier @entity258 , consumer products giant @entity260 and high street pub owner @entity261			1
one benefit of a faster - growing economy is that tax revenues such as vat and income tax rise , helping to bring down the budget deficit			0
but if the government really wants to drive longer - term recovery it will need to find more innovative ways of funding infrastructure spending , to adopt reforms to the planning system and to introduce more tax breaks for investment by small businesses .			0

growth of 0.6 **%** from april to june , up from 0.3 **%** in first 3 months of 2013
every sector of the economy including construction saw an uplift
