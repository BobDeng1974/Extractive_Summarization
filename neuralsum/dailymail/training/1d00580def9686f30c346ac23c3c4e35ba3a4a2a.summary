a telescope in @entity1 has captured a stunning view of ' @entity3 ' 1,300 light years away			2
the cometary globule , also known as @entity5 , shines brightly in this spectacular image , and looks as though it is about to grab at stars			1
although it appears vivid in this picture , this is in fact a faint nebula , which makes it very hard for amateur sky watchers to spot			0
although it appears vivid in this picture , this is in fact a faint nebula , which makes it very hard for amateur sky watchers to spot astronomers believe it is powered by the leftover , dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion			1
but its exact nature remains a mystery			0
in 1976 several elongated comet - like objects were discovered on pictures taken with the @entity39 in @entity40			0
because of their appearance , they became known as cometary globules even though they have nothing in common with comets			2
they had dense , dark , dusty heads and long , faint tails , which were generally pointing away from the @entity51 supernova remnant located at the centre of the @entity53			0
although these objects are relatively close by , it took astronomers a long time to find them as they glow very dimly and are therefore hard to detect			0
the nebula is powered by the leftover , dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion			1
the stellar corpse , called @entity63 - 58 , or @entity63 for short , is a pulsar : it rapidly spins around , seven times per second , firing out a particle wind into the material around it @entity3 is a pulsar wind nebula			0
it 's powered by the leftover , dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion			1
the stellar corpse , called @entity63 - 58 , or @entity63 for short , is a pulsar			0
it rapidly spins around , seven times per second , firing out a particle wind into the material around it			0
these particles are interacting with magnetic fields around the material , causing it to glow with x-rays			0
it is located about 1300 light - years from @entity81 in the constellation of @entity83 the object shown in this latest picture , @entity5 , which is also sometimes referred to as the @entity84 , is one of these cometary globules			1
the fist of ' @entity3 ' , which is the part visible on this image and resembles the head of the gigantic beast , has a diameter of 1.5 light - years			1
the tail of the globule — which extends downwards and is not visible in the image — is about eight light - years long			1
by astronomical standards this makes it a comparatively small cloud			0
the relatively small size is a general feature of cometary globules			2
all of the cometary globules found so far are isolated , relatively small clouds of neutral gas and dust within the @entity107 , which are surrounded by hot ionised material			1
the head part of @entity5 is a thick cloud of gas and dust , which is only visible because it is illuminated by the light from nearby stars			1
the radiation emitted by these stars is gradually destroying the head of the globule and eroding away the tiny particles that scatter the starlight			2
however , the dusty cloud of @entity123 , captured by the @entity125 's @entity124 , still contains enough gas to make several sun - sized stars			2
the head part of @entity5 is a thick cloud of gas and dust , which is only visible because it is illuminated by the light from stars			1
this wide - field image shows a rich region of the sky in the constellation of @entity83 ( @entity137 )			0
at the centre lies the strange cometary globule @entity5			1
other interesting objects are also seen , including several much more distant spiral galaxies why @entity5 and other cometary globules have their distinct form is still a matter of debate among astronomers and two theories have developed			1
cometary globules could originally have been spherical nebulae , which were disrupted and acquired their new , unusual form because of the effects of a nearby supernova explosion			2
other astronomers suggest , that cometary globules are shaped by stellar winds and ionising radiation from hot , massive stars			1
these effects could first lead to the bizarrely named formations known as elephant trunks and then eventually cometary globules			2
to find out more , astronomers need to find out the mass , density , temperature , and velocities of the material in the globules			0
these can be determined by the measurements of molecular spectral lines which are most easily accessible at millimetre wavelengths — wavelengths at which telescopes like the @entity172 ( @entity172 ) operate			0
this chart of the southern constellation of @entity83 ( the poop , part of the mythological ship @entity178 ) shows most of the stars visible with the naked eye on a dark and clear night			0
the position of the strange cometary globule @entity5 is marked by a red ring			1

the cometary globule , also known as @entity5 , is powered by the leftover , dense core of a star
the head of @entity5 , which is the part visible in this @entity125 image , has a diameter of 1.5 light - years
why @entity5 and other cometary globules have their distinct form is still unknown by astronomers
one theory is cometary globules are shaped by stellar winds and radiation from hot , massive stars
