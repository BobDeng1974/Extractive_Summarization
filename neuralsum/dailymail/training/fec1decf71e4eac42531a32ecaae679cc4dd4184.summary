by @entity0 ' suffering ' : @entity1 , pictured with @entity2 on their wedding day , cried in court as closing statements were made during her murder trial the widower of a bride who was murdered on their honeymoon broke down into tears as a lawyer hit back at ' grotesque theories ' put forward by the defence of her alleged killers			1
@entity1 and @entity19 had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled in the bathtub of their luxury hotel on the paradise island of @entity24			1
two hotel employees are accused of murdering 27 - year - old mrs @entity19 when she returned to the couple ’s room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing			1
lawyers defending former hotel workers @entity30 and @entity32 had drawn the jury ’s attention to a sex guide in the couple ’s room and made references to sado - masochism			1
however , it later turned out that this was a free insert in a popular women ’s magazine			0
@entity44 ’s widower mr @entity1 sat bent over , looking at the floor , as prosecutor @entity46 told jurors these were ‘ insulting ’ innuendos that had been raised and cynically dropped by the defence			1
as the murder trial in the @entity52 drew towards its close after 30 days , the strain became too much for the young widower			1
at one point during the prosecution ’s 90 - minute closing speech , he appeared to discreetly wipe away tears , his head shielded from the view of the jurors by the bench in front			0
mr @entity46 told the court : ‘ the person who has suffered the most on all of this , as if he has n’t suffered enough after the death of the love of his life , @entity2 , is @entity1 , ‘ i am duty - bound to speak about the manner in which fingers have been constantly pointed at @entity1 in the most unbefitting manner			1
’ he said several ‘ grotesque theories ’ had been aired , including questions about erotic asphyxiation and the possible use of a belt found among the @entity77 ’ possessions			2
@entity1 pictured at the @entity80 court : he and @entity19 had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled witness : mr @entity1 arrives at court to give evidence at the trial in the island 's capital , @entity80 accused : @entity30 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) are standing trial for @entity2 's murder accused : flanked by police officers , @entity90 , 30 , ( right ) and @entity91 , 42 , arrive at @entity52			1
they are accused of murdering mrs @entity19 when she returned to the room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing mr @entity46 also referred to the ‘ infamous ’ cctv footage that the defence had implied showed @entity1 and @entity2 arguing at the hotel reception shortly before the killing			1
however , police later came to court with proof the couple in the video were @entity106 holidaymakers			0
all the defence theories were fortunately ‘ short - lived ’ and had been abandoned ‘ one after the other ’ when it became clear they were unfounded , mr @entity46 told the @entity52 in @entity80			0
he contrasted their behaviour with the straightforward way mr @entity1 , a @entity113 player , had given his testimony			1
‘ he came all the way from @entity116 with his family to seek justice for the wrongful murder of his wife , ’ he said			2
‘ he came and told us about how they met … about the fairytale wedding , about the house they had bought together and never got to share and @entity1 told us that his life ended when her life ended			1
’ the defence ’s case could only have confused the jury and was ‘ very insulting to @entity1 and his family and to the memory of @entity2 ’ , mr @entity46 added			1
mr @entity1 kept his head bowed for most of the speech			1
@entity2 ’s brother @entity136 looked down helplessly at the young widower as he was forced to relive the darkest moments of the trial			1
it was only when mr @entity46 finished his address ten minutes later that mr @entity1 finally sat back upright , taking a deep breath and appearing to compose himself			2
happier times : @entity2 and @entity1 with her father @entity144 , left , bishop @entity1 and the groom 's father @entity145 at their wedding at @entity149 's the lawyer , who described the trial as the most taxing and challenging of his career , had told the nine jurors the evidence could leave them in no doubt that the two accused were responsible for the killing			1
the prosecution case is that when @entity2 went to get a biscuit to go with her tea , she interrupted the two men stealing from her room and was strangled			1
‘ this was a robbery that turned into a brutal murder , ’ he said			2
‘ it would have been easier for the two accused to beg forgiveness from @entity2 and to walk away			2
the worst that could have happened would have been the loss of their jobs			0
but they decided to murder her			2
this shows that they both possess killing instincts and have no respect for human life			0
’ @entity2 , the daughter of @entity178 @entity144 , was found strangled in her room in january last year			1
@entity180 , 43 , a former floor supervisor from @entity182 , and @entity183 , 32 , a former room attendant from @entity185 , deny murdering the 27 - year - old			1
@entity2 ’s brother and the @entity77 – @entity1 , his sister @entity188 and father @entity189 – had remained out of court on the day details from the post-mortem report were revealed			1
yesterday was the first day they heard the graphic details of the injuries she sustained at the hands of her killer			0
her brother dropped his head and hid from view as the court heard of @entity2 ’s desperate attempts to fight for her life			2
earlier , mr @entity46 said the police deserved praise rather than criticism for ‘ solving the case in record time ’			0
referring to the defence ’s contention that officers ‘ bungled ’ the inquiry , he said that it was not for the jury to adjudicate on the police			0
@entity218 ’s lawyers had argued that his confession to the murder had been extracted by torture			2
nightmare in paradise : the couple 's room at @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity24 luxury holiday : a view of the swimming pool at the five - star @entity225 in @entity24 , where the newlywed couple were staying on trial : a sobbing @entity30 pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial			1
he pleaded not guilty to the killing however , mr @entity46 said that this had been disproved and that the accused had ‘ come before you and regurgitated a concocted and rehearsed story ’			0
evidence from three doctors who examined him in january last year ‘ confirmed that the allegations of police brutality were totally unfounded ’ , the lawyer said			2
he also reminded the jurors that @entity246 , who was acting for mr @entity218 , had withdrawn from the trial early on and had never come back to support his claim that his client was abused			0
previously , the court heard @entity218 had given a statement saying he and @entity180 were both in the couple ’s room stealing when @entity2 walked in and that @entity32 had killed her			1
@entity32 ’s lawyers had claimed he was on the phone to his sister at the time of the killing but the prosecutor questioned why he had waited 18 months to give this explanation and said the call did not appear in any of the statements from the time			2
the defence ’s theories about the @entity1 ’s belt had been disproved by the chief police medical officer			2
dr @entity269 had told the trial : ‘ i am 100 per cent sure			0
no belt could have been used			0
’ mr @entity46 said the fact there was no dna or fingerprints from the accused in the couple ’s room did not mean the men had not been there			0
he said expert witness @entity280 had explained that @entity274 samples can dissolve in water			0
he told jurors to trust the testimony of @entity285 , a former colleague of @entity183 and @entity180 , who told police he saw the pair coming from the direction of @entity2 and @entity1 ’s room at the time of the murder			1
he said @entity285 was a ‘ trusted witness ’ with ‘ no reason to lie ’			0
summing up , mr @entity46 said : ‘ members of the jury , there are no politics to truth			0
there is right and there is wrong			0
i have no doubt whatsoever that when you consider the evidence , objectively and dispassionately , that you will reach the right decision – that the two accused are guilty as charged			0
’ the @entity77 and mr @entity136 sat in solemn silence as the court emptied			0
the group appeared drained as they later made their way out past waiting cameramen and reporters			0
after nearly 50 testimonies , the last witness was called on thursday			0
the defence will deliver closing statements on monday and a verdict is expected next week .			0
