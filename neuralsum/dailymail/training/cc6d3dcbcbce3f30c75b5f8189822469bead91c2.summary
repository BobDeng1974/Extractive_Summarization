brrrrr ! we are bang in the middle of winter and , sadly , the tan from my recent holiday to @entity6 is fading fast			2
looking on the bright side , this gives me a rare chance to experiment with a pale and interesting make - up look			2
so this week i ’m trying out modern @entity12 glamour – a gorgeous look that ’s all dark smoky eyes , deep mulberry lips and flawless foundation			2
@entity17 tries out the glam @entity12 look , with smoky eyes and a perfectly applied deep plum pout get the look alluring eyes naturally you ’ll begin with your base			1
go for the full works , applying foundation , concealer and powder to achieve the beautifully pale , creamy complexion that the @entity12 look requires			0
after smoothing primer across your lids ( try @entity33 ) , take an inky shade and smooth it over your lids			0
i used @entity37 in @entity38 , which has a soft , smudgeable formula and boasts a handy blending sponge at the tip. do n’t fret about it looking too perfect as next you ’re going to blend more colour on top – i used a dark - chocolate shade called @entity47 from the @entity48 , smudging it over the eye pencil to create really dark , sultry lids			1
multiple layers of black mascara will give you really long , thick , sooty lashes			0
i used @entity54 , wiggling the wand right into the roots and along to the tips of my lashes to make sure each one was covered with colour			0
finally , it ’s easy to scatter eyeshadow on to your cheeks when doing smoky eyes , so i smudge on a touch of @entity66 to tidy up any spills and conceal dark circles at the same time			0
@entity17 uses contouring tricks to give her cheekbones subtle definition while still looking pale and interesting beautiful @entity73 yes , i ’ve managed to sneak a little bronzer into this look but the object here is to add definition not colour			1
blend @entity78 below your cheekbones and under your jawline to contour your face and sharpen up your bone structure			0
blend in the velvety powder using a big fluffy brush , and you ’ll have supermodel - style cheekbones in no time ! luscious lips to create my @entity12 pout i used a clever make - up artist ’s trick			1
begin by filling in your whole lip area with dark eyeliner pencil – i used @entity97 in @entity98			1
do n't be alarmed by your matte - black lips as the effect will be softened when you smudge a glossy , berry coloured lip stain over the top – try @entity106 in @entity107			1
the result is a luscious , wine - coloured pout that looks as dramatic as it does divine			1
you can get all the products i used to create this look from @entity114			2
the made in @entity117 star rocks a romantic - cum - @entity12 make - up that looks ' as dramatic as it does divine ' if you ’re wary of sporting a deep , dark lip but still want to experiment with the modern @entity12 look , a sheerer lipstick such as lord & @entity124 in @entity125 will give the look a softer finish			1
this is a stunning evening beauty look , and luckily the long winter nights offer up plenty of opportunities to give it a go			2
what i really love about ultra-glam make - up like this is that it calls for a similarly breathtaking outfit – a sultry dress , perhaps , and some spectacular statement jewellery			0
i mean , which girl does n’t relish the chance to slip into a red - carpet gown and serious diamonds ! ? here , i ’m wearing a £ 200,000 white - gold necklace decorated with 30 carats of diamonds , and a gorgeous £ 50,000 , 15 - carat ballroom bracelet from jeweller @entity148			1
binky sparkles in a white gold diamond necklace and £ 50,000 ballroom bracelet that she says compliments this week 's equally dramatic beauty look perfectly binky pairs her glamorous evening make - up with this £ 200,000 two - strand diamond necklace sadly these pieces were only mine for the duration of the photo shoot , and there was a security guard on hand to make sure i gave them back			1
but just draping on these gems was thrilling , nonetheless			0
the good news ? @entity169 to @entity170 and you ’ll find there ’s plenty to lust after in the jeweller ’s more affordable range – glittering designs which boast the same fine quality but at more achievable prices			0
so excuse me while i shop for some new sparklers			0
well , you know what they say : diamonds are a girl ’s best friend ! stay glam			0
