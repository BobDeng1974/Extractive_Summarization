syringe and blood - smeared latex glove found near 31 - year - old 's corpse @entity3 tried to prevent autopsy as ' dissection ' would violate religious beliefs by @entity7 last updated at 1:11 pm on 26th september 2011 the discovery of a doctor 's body in a locked bathroom at the hospital where he worked has turned into a possible murder inquiry			1
the body of anaesthetist dr @entity16 , 31 , was found at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , on august 23 along with a syringe and a blood - smeared latex glove			1
police who investigated at the time did not believe it to be foul play as there was no signs of a struggle			0
the body of anaesthetist dr @entity16 , 31 , was found at the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , on august 23 along with a syringe and a blood - smeared latex glove			1
however in his native @entity33 there have been claims in the media , as well as on a government website , that he was murdered			0
local coroner @entity37 subsequently ordered an autopsy but it has been condemned by dr @entity16 's family who said ' dissecting ' his body would violate his and their beliefs and ' strike at the heart of their religious identity '			1
the controversy came to light during a legal challenge to prevent the autopsy at the @entity51 in @entity52 last week			1
the judge mr @entity53 ruled that an invasive autopsy was the only way of finding out if there was ' third party involvement ' in the @entity33 's death			1
his sister dr @entity60 initially supported the claim he has been murdered but later withdrew the accusation saying she was grief - stricken when she made it ' in the heat of the moment '			2
she argued that ' cutting ' the body would cause the family enormous distress and less intrusive toxicology tests , along with @entity71 scanning of his corpse , would be enough to dispel any suspicion that the doctor had been strangled			2
dr @entity60 said her family now believed there was nothing suspicious about the death and they should be allowed to have the body repatriated intact to @entity33			0
her barrister , @entity81 , said an autopsy would breach the ' fundamental tenets ' of the family 's faith and amount to a violation of human rights to respect for family life and freedom of religion			1
can @entity91 , for the coroner , said suspicions raised by the @entity33 media , and initially by dr @entity60 herself , meant a thorough investigation had to be carried out			0
neither toxicology testing nor @entity71 scanning would rule out foul play , mr @entity91 told the judge			0
he said other patients at the @entity100 hospital might object to being scanned by a machine that had been used on a dead body			0
mr @entity91 added that if the equipment were used on dr @entity16 ' it would be very much a first , not only in @entity100 but probably in the @entity106 '			0
the coroner had also received firm advice that @entity71 scanning could not detect ' subtle pathology , such as pressure to the neck ' and ' would n't be sufficient to rule out third party involvement '			0
local experience of using @entity71 equipment to scan dead bodies was ' non-existent ' and such techniques would not uncover ' subtle injuries that are found in some kinds of homicide '			2
mr @entity53 said the police investigation was prompted by dr @entity60 's initial ' very serious allegations to the effect that the deceased had been murdered ' and the stories circulating in the @entity33 press			0
mr @entity53 also said that although toxicology tests on dr @entity16 's blood and urine might be effective in detecting the presence of any drugs , they would not reveal whether they were ' administered by a third party ' or whether force was used			1
with dr @entity16 's body deteriorating , it was concluded that an invasive autopsy was the only viable means of investigation			1
the coroner told the @entity51 that he had ' real regret ' that an autopsy would entail ' further upset ' to dr @entity16 's family			2
mr @entity53 also expressed his ' great sympathy ' for the loss of a young man at the start of his medical career .			0
