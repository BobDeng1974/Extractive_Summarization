@entity0 has a 500million euro problem : his gold - plated diamond - studded super squad is heavy on attacking forward flair and light on midfield runners			2
as one of his many predecessors , @entity7 complained in 2003 : ' i have a lot of concert pianists but no one to move the piano			0
' @entity15 could be his answer			0
the @entity18 coach will have had two weeks to think about how best to give his team back its balance by the time @entity18 play the local derby with champions @entity23 this weekend and the @entity26 coach is considering using @entity15 in a slightly more withdrawn role to compensate for the loss of @entity29			1
new role : @entity15 ( left ) looks set to move into central midfield as @entity18 try to replace @entity29 stamina : @entity0 believes @entity15 has the engine required to be the driving force in the @entity18 side ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity15 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45			1
@entity0 wants to retain @entity18 ’s 4 - 3 - 3 shape – the formation that helped them win the @entity49 last season – but whereas last season @entity51 had the engine to play on the left of the three and protect the left back , @entity46 already looks as though he is struggling in the role			1
@entity15 ’s phenomenal stamina has been displayed many times in his career from his days as a marauding left - back , to the taxi for @entity64 nights , to the lung - busting goal scored with a run from the half - way line in the last minutes of the @entity69 final , so @entity0 is weighing up the possibility of playing @entity15 on the left of a midfield three with @entity42 and @entity41			1
the plus side for @entity15 will be that he ends up back on his favoured left side and @entity0 believes @entity15 like @entity51 will not only be capable of doing a job defensively but also be capable of running down the left filling the space vacated by @entity45 as he moves from his starting position on the left of the front three to a more central position			1
replacement : @entity15 look set to slot into @entity51 's position after the @entity84 joined @entity85 attacking flair : @entity15 needs to drop deeper to accommodate @entity46 and @entity45 @entity15 may well feel moving further from goal is scant reward for his netting 20 times last season but such is life at @entity18 that everyone has to be accommodating when a new star arrives			1
@entity93 was also shoehorned into a wide - left starting position in the @entity96 team that @entity97 joined in 2003			0
the @entity98 spent most of the game coming inside to influence the match as left back @entity101 overlapped him			0
@entity97 ended up playing in a holding midfield position in that team because @entity105 ’s name was already written in stone on the right wing			0
a long term solution to @entity0 ’s problems could be the incorporation of @entity111 on the left of the midfield with @entity15 returning to the top three – last season dubbed the @entity116			2
but a forward line of @entity15 , @entity44 and @entity45 leaves no place for @entity46 and so that would not completely solve @entity0 ’s dilemma			2
he needs the right balance to win football matches , but he also needs to keep his president happy after another summer of big signings			0
history : @entity93 was shoehorned into a wide - left position after @entity97 joined the @entity128 side			0

@entity18 have an *abundance* of attacking *options*
but they have few players who can play in central midfield
@entity15 is set to drop back into the role vacated by @entity29
@entity0 believes he has the engine to play on left of midfield three
@entity46 has struggled to slot into the same role
