but the @entity11 star has actually hit out at rogue members of her cycling tribe , saying that they jump lights and weave dangerously through traffic			1
the double gold medal winner also said that accidents were ‘ not always the car ’s fault ’ and insisted that laws should be brought in to make safety helmets compulsory			1

i see cyclists jumping in and out of the buses and people wonder why they get hit			0
‘ it ’s not always the car ’s fault			1
cyclists need to help themselves and should not jump red lights			0
i would ride in @entity37 but i certainly would n’t ride like that , you just have to be careful			0
‘ i can understand going down the outside of traffic but you should obey the rules of the road because we ’re all road users			0
