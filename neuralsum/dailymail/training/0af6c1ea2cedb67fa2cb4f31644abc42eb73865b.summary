' the wedding was a shore dive , which meant most of the guests swam from the shore to the site of the ceremony			2
the service was attended by twenty guests and most were able to watch the ceremony fully submerged , with the aid of oxygen masks , goggles , and scuba gear underneath their regular outfits			1
