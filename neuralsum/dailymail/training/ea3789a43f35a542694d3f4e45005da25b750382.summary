' everyone is different , but typically around 20 hours of me time each week is a good amount to help feel in control of life and evaluate your goals			2
' some people may spread this out over the week , while others in highly - pressured jobs may ' binge ' on down time at the weekend to catch up after a busy week			1
' people living in the @entity57 get the most @entity98 a week ( 28 hours ) - 10 hours more than the @entity68 who have the least ( 18 hours ) , according to the research			2
those aged 25 to 34 have the least amount of time to themselves ( 13 hours per week ) , eight hours less than the national average of 21 hours			2

researchers found that workers are becoming increasingly stressed due to time shortages , file photo @entity115 , of @entity26 , said : ' the findings show that taking some time out for yourself is a necessity these days , not a luxury			2
' busy lives can mean we forget to step back and give ourselves space to relax or take a minute to do the little things that make us happy			0
' with that in mind , @entity26 is launching ' @entity127 ' - a project encouraging singles to do something that makes them feel good every sunday - be it trying out a new recipe at home , curling up on the couch with a good book or just taking 10 minutes out to sit and relax , or maybe even chat to a new match			1
