it may be almost an entire decade since the @entity2 tsunami wiped out 230,000 people in southeast @entity4 , but for @entity6 it is as raw as if it happened yesterday after the unthinkable loss of his son and daughter - in - law			1
@entity6 will never forget the joy he felt when he received a call from his son @entity13 , and his wife @entity15 , to say they were pregnant on christmas day in 2004			1
but that feeling of overwhelming happiness only lasted 24 hours as the @entity20 couple died in a beach hut in @entity22 , @entity23 when the 98 - foot freak waves smashed in from the @entity25			1
' i did n't want them to go to @entity23 because of the social unrest - it never occurred to me that a tsunami would be the problem , ' he said			1
' most people say opposites attract but they were both very similar - we used to say @entity15 was a clone of him , ' he said			2
if the 72 - year - old could describe his son in one word it would be ' rejoice '			1
' his positive attitude was his art of living , ' he said			0
' he was exuberant and demonstrative about his feelings something i never experienced from my father - he was the antithesis of that			2
' @entity6 was only able to bring himself to watch their wedding video just last week			2
' it was a combination of great joy and despair , ' he said			0
' they would have been wonderful parents - i almost had a chance to be grand dad and make up for the mistakes the first time around			2
' @entity6 was only able to bring himself to watch @entity13 and @entity15 's wedding video last week @entity6 said the emotions were as raw as if the couple had just died yesterday since his wife died of a heart attack 30 years ago - when @entity13 and his sister , @entity38 , discovered their mother 's body - @entity6 took on the role of both father and mother			1
' a day away of someone you love is equal to a year - so 10 years in some ways seems like 100 years , ' he said			1
' it 's such an emotional involvement for us and our friends			0
' with the incredible capacity to see the positives of enduring such an unspeakable tragedy , @entity6 said it could have been worse as @entity38 , who had just been holidaying with the couple in @entity100 , had originally planned to also join her brother and sister - in - law in @entity23			1
' if she was n't invited to a wedding in @entity20 - i would have lost the lot of them , ' he said			0
' so when you look at adversity you have got to think how much worse off you can be			0
' @entity13 and his sister @entity38 ( left ) had a close bond that could never be broken @entity15 was so similar in personality to her husband that she was described by @entity6 as a clone of his son on the fateful day , while waiting for the news of @entity13 and @entity15 's whereabouts , @entity6 fell off his roof when the ladder slipped away while he was cleaning the gutters and broke several vertebrae			1
his daughter @entity38 , who lives in @entity124 but was home for @entity126 , took charge in coordinating the search for their bodies			0
@entity13 's body was found within a few weeks by computer generating a match with his teeth from a photograph			2
but his wife 's remains took many more months to retrieve - then both bodies were flown back to their families six months later			0
@entity6 could not speak highly enough of how the @entity23 and @entity141 authorities handled the unprecedented crisis			1
' it was incredible , ' he said			0
' the government even offered to do another post-mortem when they came home			0
' @entity38 is returning to @entity23 with her father for the 10 year anniversary of the @entity2 tsunami @entity13 and @entity15 's bodies were returned to their families in @entity141 six months later a year later , the couple 's belongings were retrieved including carry bags , wallets , phone and their wedding rings			1
' i asked for a hair lock but he was too far gone , ' he said			0
' they told me his body was in tact because he had two or three broken ribs which means he would have passed and subsequently drowned			0
' a decade on , @entity6 still dreams about his son three times a week			2
' he sometimes appears as a small boy and sometime as a grown man - it reopens the immediacy of the situation - so yes 10 years has passed in record time , ' he said			2
' he did appear to me in a dream once and told me the whole tsunami never happened to him and his life was still carrying on , ' he said			0
' he said he has moved into another dimension which we are not a part of but we are still there with him in our own way			0
' the couple died in a beach hut in @entity22 , @entity23 ( pictured ) when the 98 - foot freak waves smashed in from the @entity25 @entity6 said he has to move forward otherwise he would ' roll into a ball and pull the stone across the cave and fade into nothing '			1
' but the loss and the emotional yearning and loneliness of not having them there is still as raw as it was 10 years ago , ' he said			0
' it does n't seem to soften things to that extent with someone that you are profoundly connected to			0
' @entity6 , who went to @entity23 six months after the horror and then two years later , is going over again with his daughter , @entity38 , for the 10 year anniversary			1
