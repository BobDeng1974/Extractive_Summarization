by @entity0 the 67 - year - old sex - line worker known as @entity2 , whose story of desperate measures made @entity6 's prime minister wink , has finally responded to the controversial incident			1
the @entity9 grandmother whose real name is @entity11 , told the @entity12 that @entity13 was as sleazy as some of her clients			1
' i did n't see what he did until they replayed it on @entity20			0
i just could n't believe it – it was the sleaziest looking smirk i 've seen in a long long time and he looked sleazier than most of the blokes that ring me up …			0
and some of them are seriously weird , ' ms @entity28 down for video 67 - year - old grandmother , @entity11 , who told prime minister @entity13 on talkback radio that she worked on a sex line to make ends meet just before he winked , has dubbed his behavior ' sleazy ' and ' misogynistic ' mr @entity13 has since admitted that he should n't have winked while listening to ms @entity11 's radio talk - back call while she told him she had to work on a phone sex line to make ends meet			1
he said the wink was directed at the host of the @entity42 program and was not meant to be disparaging of the caller , who described herself as a chronically ill pensioner in tough financial circumstances			2
mr @entity13 said he was looking at the host - the @entity20 's @entity47 - and was winking his assent to take the call			1
' look , i was looking at @entity47 , he was smiling at me and i winked back at him , ' mr @entity13 told the @entity51 on thursday			1
' i should n't have done it ... i should have been more focused on the caller and less focused on the interviewer			0
' asked if he was being disparaging towards the woman , mr @entity13 said he was attempting to engage with the caller			2
' mistakes are always regrettable ... and i will do my best having made a mistake yesterday to make none today , ' he said			0
mr @entity13 has so far acknowledged that he should n't have winked during the interview , but claims that he was only winking his assent to take the call at the radio host @entity63 but ms @entity11 is not convinced , claiming the prime ministers words are just part of ' damage control ' protocol			1
' he was n't leering at @entity63 – he was leering and sniggering because i said i was 67 and a sex line worker , ' she said			1
mr @entity47 's comments so far , have also been somewhat removed from mr @entity13 's claims			1
@entity47 : @entity2 in @entity71			2
good morning @entity2 you are talking to @entity13 the @entity73 : @entity74 : hi @entity75 : mr @entity13 , i would like to ask you if you would like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation			1
i am a 67 year old pensioner , three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life - threatening			0
i just survive on about $ 400 a fortnight after i pay my rent and i work on an adult sex line to make ends meet			1
[ @entity87 @entity86 ] now , that 's the only way i can do it			0
i 've worked out and my maths is n’t crash hot that it ’s going to cost me at least an extra $ 850 a year with the increases in medical visits and medication			0
i ’m on a number of different medications that may probably increase as my conditions deteriorate			0
what do you suggest i cut out mr @entity13 – food , electricity , firewood , @entity102 / birthday presents to my grandchildren or should we all just die and get out of your way ? @entity87 @entity106 : well @entity2 , i absolutely understand that you 're doing it tough – i absolutely understand … @entity108 : you do n't give a stuff though , do you ? @entity87 @entity110 : keep it nice			1
@entity2 , keep it nice			2
it 's the prime minister you ’re speaking @entity115 : no , i do n't feel very nice about you mr @entity13 and why should i ? @entity87 @entity106 : well @entity2 , what i want to do is get rid of the carbon tax , but you will keep the compensation that the former @entity120 government gave you to pay for the carbon tax			1
so , even if you spend $ 70 going to the doctor , even if you pay an extra 80 cents per prescription , almost certainly in pure cash terms , @entity2 , you will be somewhat better off			2
now , i ’m not saying that you 're on easy street , i 'd never say that			0
obviously you ’re doing it tough			0
but let ’s look at the reality here			0
the safety net kicks in after ten visits to the doctor – that 's after $ 70 and yes there 's an 80 cent increase in the pensioner co-payment , but you would ’ve had an extra couple of hundred dollars a year as a result of your carbon tax compensation and we want to take that carbon tax off you			0
' i raised an eyebrow because it 's not every day that a grandmother on radio says that she supplements her pension by working on a sex call line , ' mr @entity47 said during his radio program on thursday			1
' it is a complete fabrication to say i somehow winked at the prime minister or was smirking or anything like that			2
nor was i indicating that i needed his permission to continue which was the statement from the prime minister 's office			1
' but the grandmother of three from @entity71 , who does n't have internet in her home nor follow social media , is still quite shocked at the amount of attention the incident has received			0
' if he 'd then just said " i 'm an old fashioned bloke and i got a bit embarrassed , and something like that happening had never occurred to me so i pulled a stupid face " , it would have been over by now , ' ms @entity11 said			1
she described how she instantly received numerous calls of congratulations from friends and family before she fully understood the impact of what had happened			0
' this has gone far enough , it 's out of control – if he had n't behaved how he did , what i said would have been forgotten by the end of the day if not before , ' she said , revealing she was eager to get back to her normal life			0
ms @entity11 had called in to the talk back show to let off some steam over the planned introduction of a $ 7 gp co-payment , announced in the budget			1
as a pensioner suffering from a range of illnesses including emphysema and arthritis , she revealed that she began to work on a sex line almost four years ago to make ends meet			1
' i just survive on around $ 400 a fortnight after i pay my rent , ' she told mr @entity13			2
' i work on an adult sex line to make ends meet			1
now that 's the only way i can do it			0
' mr @entity13 's faux pas , which was caught on camera , comes as he faces a collapse in his personal approval rating			1
the coalition is suffering in the opinion polls in the wake of the budget , with @entity120 having opened a 10 - point lead on a two - party preferred basis at 55 per cent to 45 per cent			0
foreign minister @entity208 , the only woman in mr @entity13 's cabinet , said there was nothing sexist in the prime minister 's wink which was intended as a go - ahead signal for the call			1
' i think people are far to quick to judge others through this prism of everything being about misogyny or sexism , ' she told @entity42			0
ms @entity208 said she was always treated with respect by mr @entity13 and her male colleagues in cabinet			2
' believe me , i 've worked in some sexist environments and this is n't one of them , ' she said			0
but ms @entity11 claims the complete opposite , telling the @entity230 that she was glad the incident received attention			2
' i was a catalyst for him showing himself for what he is , which is sleazy and a misogynist , ' she said			0
describing herself as a long - time feminist and anarchist , ms @entity11 said she was concerned about the fact that her real name had been revealed due to the line of her work			2

grandmother @entity11 , 67 , said the prime minister 's wink was ' sleazy '
she called the @entity42 show on *wednesday* as ' @entity2 ' to talk about the budget before admitting she worked on a sex line to make ends meet
@entity13 said he should n't have winked , claiming he was *distracted* by the show 's host , @entity47
ms @entity11 , who named herself @entity2 on the radio , said mr @entity13 was lying and was ' *sneering* ' at what she 'd said
