two young movie fans have put their own spin on this year 's nominees for @entity3 at the @entity4 , recreating the most iconic scenes from each big screen hit in their own unique way			1
with direction from their movie - loving mother @entity10 , four - year - old @entity12 and her three - year - old sister @entity8 re-enacted scenes from all eight @entity3 nominees , including @entity15 , for their photo - based blog , which is aptly - named do n't @entity18			1
it is the fourth year in a row that the girls have paid tribute to the iconic @entity4 ceremony in this way , with @entity12 having first starred on the blog when she was just four months old			1
' now , my favorite part is looking back at the archive			0
' the blog is a snapshot of our family from the same week every year			2
' @entity8 was born the week after our first [ picture ] was posted and now she â€™s flapping her wings in @entity32			2
it 's an amazing way to watch our family grow and to document some of our fondest memories			0
' while the girls are far too young to have seen any of the nominated movies themselves , both have formed strong opinions about which ones they favor - based purely on their experiences of acting out one pivotal scene from each			0
@entity8 opted for @entity32 , which stars @entity35 and @entity36 , with her mother admitting that the youngster even spent time rehearsing her part in the picture , while @entity12 picked emotional drama @entity77 , which stars @entity78 and @entity79 in the lead roles			1
need a clue ? in order to recreate this image from @entity85 , the @entity10 family had to put their crafting skills to work to recreate the numerous dials found on @entity90 's code - breaking machine firm favorite : @entity92 ( pictured ) is also nominated in the @entity94 category boxed up : as part of their preparation for this scene from @entity99 , @entity12 ( r ) and @entity8 ( @entity29 ) had to put their crafting skills to the test in order to make all of the boxes featured in the background fiction v fantasy : the original movie ( pictured ) is set in a famous hotel from the @entity108 of @entity109 true love : @entity12 ( @entity29 ) and @entity8 ( r ) had a chance to play with some fun costumes in order to recreate this scene from the @entity115 wedding day : @entity117 ( @entity29 ) and @entity118 ( r ) both received individual nods for their performances in the biopic , which is based on the life of scientist @entity123 despite not being able to watch any of the films that they were acting out , @entity10 gave her children a brief synopsis of each one after @entity12 asked to understand more about the scenes that they would be starring in			1
and in addition to the background research , the family spent weeks preparing the scenery for each image , with @entity10 admitting that the background for @entity99 , which features dozens of pink packages , took the longest to perfect			2
' after a week of glue sticks , scissors and construction paper , they were so looking forward to taking the picture , it felt like @entity143 , ' she added			0
both girls have clearly come a long way since their efforts last year ; following the completion of their photos for 2014 's nominees , @entity10 revealed that working with such young stars had its difficulties , particularly when the girls were left to their own devices			1
' we set [ the scenery ] up when the girls are asleep and then put @entity12 in the middle of the picture when she wakes up in the morning , ' she explained at the time			2
play things : in place of men , @entity12 is facing some of her favorite toys on this recreation of the poster for historical drama @entity165 paying her respects : despite her young age , @entity12 still manages to capture the incredible emotion within this poignant image from @entity172 sniper impressive performance : @entity174 is also nominated for best actor at this year 's ceremony feel the rhythm : the youngster shows off her most dramatic pose in this re-enactment of a scene from @entity77 - which was @entity12 's favorite poster to recreate top notch : @entity78 ( pictured ) has been commended for his impressive performance in the drama , which also stars @entity79 ' with toddlers , if you do n't get the photo on the first take it wo n't work - they eat the props , they play with the dolls , they run amok in a spacesuit			1
' the @entity10 family 's photo project first began as a light - hearted attempt to make @entity10 's sister - a journalist who was covering the @entity4 in 2011 - laugh			1
but after posting them online , @entity10 says she was taken aback by the positive reaction the fun images received			0
' my sister is a journalist , working on @entity4 coverage and we took the photos to make her laugh			0
' our friends and family liked the photos so much they suggested we post it online			0
' i was nervous about putting my kids on the internet			0
we are absolutely shocked to see how many people really seem to enjoy the photos			0
