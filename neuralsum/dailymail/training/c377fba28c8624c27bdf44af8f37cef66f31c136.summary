by @entity0 a schoolboy has forced @entity2 to admit it made a mistake on the label of its orange juice after he noticed an embarrassing grammatical blunder			1
@entity8 , 15 , was enjoying his breakfast at home in @entity11 , @entity12 when he saw that his carton of juice boasted it was made with the ' most tastiest ' oranges			1
he wrote to the supermarket giant to complain , suggesting they change the wording to ' tastiest ' or ' most tasty ' - and they have now agreed to correct the packaging			1
fury : @entity8 was shocked to find an embarrassing grammatical blunder on a carton of @entity2 juice @entity8 , who is studying for his gcses at @entity25 , saw the mistake on the Â£ 1 carton of orange juice one morning last month			1
the label read : ' only the best quality fruit makes the grade for our juices			0
we squeeze or press it only when it 's perfectly ripe and at its most tastiest			0
' in his anger at the use of redundant language , @entity8 marched to his local branch of @entity2 to confront the management - but decided it might be more prudent to write to the company instead			1
he also sent a letter to his local newspaper , saying : ' i am writing concerning an issue i have had with the very popular supermarket chain , @entity2			2
wrong : the supermarket giant described the fruit contained in its juice as the ' most tastiest ' ' there is a grammatical error on one of their products , and this has affected me greatly			1
' i woke up on thursday morning a few weeks ago , thinking it would be like any other			0
i sat down at the table for breakfast like normal , and picked up the @entity2 orange juice			1
' it was then that i noticed it said " most tastiest " when describing the fruit on the side of the carton			2
of course , this could be either " most tasty " or simply " tastiest " but to say " most tastiest " is just wrong			0
' i was so astonished by this error - especially as @entity2 is such a large company - that i almost started pouring the orange juice on to my @entity70			1
' my mum stopped me just in time , and shared my shock when i showed her the side of the carton			0
' campaign : the 15 - year - old schoolboy wrote to @entity2 in a bid to make them acknowledge their error after writing to @entity2 , he said , ' for the next few weeks i rushed home after school , beside myself with the anticipation of a receiving a reply			1
' but every day i came home to a doormat with only the occasional leaflet urging me to buy this furniture or those clothes , but nothing from @entity2			2
' i was devastated the mighty supermarket chain had n't even acknowledged my existence			0
' finally the firm replied , apologising for the mistake and promising not to repeat it in future			2
' i 'm sorry that there 's a grammatical error on our @entity99 packaging , ' a spokesman told @entity8 , who hopes to study medicine at university			2
' our design team checks all packaging very carefully before it 's used on any of our products , and we carry out regular reviews , but apparently we overlooked this mistake			0
i 've told our team about this and they will correct the error when the packaging is reprinted			0
' the schoolboy said : ' i was happy to have a letter back , but a little bit disappointed because it did n't say more and i did n't get any vouchers - but i 'm pleased with the result			0
' he joked : ' i do n't think supermarket packaging should be wholly responsible for teaching young people @entity119 grammar - but i ca n't help thinking that " every little helps "			0

@entity8 was eating @entity70 when he saw mistake on carton of @entity2 orange juice made with the ' most tastiest ' fruit
