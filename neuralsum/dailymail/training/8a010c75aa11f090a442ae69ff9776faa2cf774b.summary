suspected @entity1 terrorists will today be warned that controversial letters giving them immunity from criminal prosecution are no longer valid			0
secretary of state for northern ireland @entity5 is due to announce that assurances in so - called ‘ comfort letters ’ sent to those suspected of offences before the @entity11 of 1988 are being withdrawn some 200 suspects had previously been told they were unlikely to face prosecution unless new evidence against them came to light			1
@entity16 , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the @entity1 ’s @entity19 bombing in 1982 , walked free from court after the existence of a so - called ' comfort letter ' emerged this year @entity16 was accused of involvement in 1982 bombing , which killed four soldiers and seven horses but it is understood that new letters are being sent out explaining that police will now mount a prosecution if it is felt there is enough evidence to do so			1
in july , a review into how an @entity1 bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police discovered two other cases where similar errors were apparently made			0
@entity38 found systematic flaws in the way ‘ comfort letters ’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on - the - run			1
critics claimed they amounted to a ‘ get out of jail free card ’ for @entity16 , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the @entity1 ’s @entity19 bombing in 1982			1
@entity47 ordered the review of the scheme after @entity16 ’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the @entity52			2
in may last year mr @entity16 was arrested at @entity53 and charged with killing squadron quartermaster corporal @entity54 , lieutenant @entity55 , trooper @entity56 and lance corporal @entity57			0
secretary of state for northern ireland @entity5 is due to announce that assurances in so - called ‘ comfort letters ’ are being withdrawn seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to @entity65			1
but the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court			1
the @entity16 case triggered a political crisis at @entity74 earlier this year			0
many politicians , particularly unionists , reacted furiously , claiming they knew nothing about the letters			0
now the @entity80 branch of the @entity81 will conduct a review of all the cases as part of the process of issuing of the letters			0
the letters had been introduced to deal with on - the - run suspects who had not been imprisoned for terrorist offences and released as part of the @entity11			2
but the secret process only came to light earlier this year when it was revealed the suspected @entity19 bomber @entity16 had been sent one of the letters			2
a review by senior judge @entity38 found systematic flaws in the way ‘ comfort letters ’ were sent out the 62 - year - old from @entity103 was arrested at @entity53 in may last year , charged with murdering four @entity52 soldiers in the 1982 bombing			1
but the case was thrown out in february because he had received one of the letters by mistake			0
mrs @entity5 will appear before the @entity111 today and it is understood she will explain that the original letters never meant the suspects would be exempt from prosecution			0
a government source told the @entity131 : ‘ what the government is determined to do is make sure that nobody in receipt of one of the original letters should be in any doubt that they can not rely on those letters to protect them from prosecution should new evidence emerge or a reassessment of existing evidence leads the @entity81 and prosecuting authorities to a different conclusion from their original one			2

suspects told they were unlikely to face court after @entity11
but critics said the assurances amounted to ' get out jail free card '
1982 bombing suspect @entity16 walked free from court due to letter
government now withdraws terms of so - called ' comfort letters '
