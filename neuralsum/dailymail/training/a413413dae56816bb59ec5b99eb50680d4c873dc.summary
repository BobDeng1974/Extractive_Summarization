by @entity0 published : 22:50 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 05:46 est , 17 october 2012 overhaul : education secretary @entity2 is planning changes to a levels education secretary @entity2 is planning to introduce changes to the a-level system in the next stage of his overhaul of the examination system , it was claimed last night			1
mr @entity2 is said to be developing an @entity11 which would see students studying a mixture of a-level subjects , writing a 5,000 - word essay and undertaking voluntary work			1
the plans are being developed soon after mr @entity2 announced he would scrap gcses in core subjects and replace them with tougher new exams			2
if his proposals are enacted it would mean the entire exam system for secondary schools will have been replaced in the space of thee years			2
the new baccalaureate system would require a-level students to study ‘ contrasting ’ subjects to give them a broad education , the @entity26 reported last night			1
a candidate who chose a levels in maths , further maths and physics , for example , would be expected to pick a humanity , such as history or @entity39 , as a fourth subject			0
mr @entity2 also wants shorter and more open - ended questions in exams			2
one option he is apparently considering is to limit the @entity44 to teenagers who choose at least two a levels from a list of subjects specified by @entity50 universities - maths , further maths , @entity52 literature , physics , biology , chemistry , geography , history , and modern and classical languages			1
universities want to keep the present system in which candidates typically study four as levels , with grades awarded after a year , and continue with three subjects for a final year , known as @entity64 , which together comprise a full a level			1
as - level grades are widely used by universities to select applicants for admissions offers			2
but some academics want the @entity72 to restore traditional a levels with exams at the end of the course			0
changing times : the reform would see students studying ' contrasting ' subjects , writing a 5,000 word essay and doing voluntary work they say many undergraduates arrive at university unprepared for intensive study , especially in maths and physics			1
the @entity44 would be based loosely on the @entity89 diploma but would keep the subject specialism of a levels			0
they would also undertake voluntary work alongside their academic studies			1
from 2015 , gcses in core subjects will be replaced with new exams called the @entity98			0
the @entity98 has been controversial , with many teachers saying that it is too prescriptive			0
@entity101 are planning a @entity102 or ‘ @entity103 ’ for 18 - year - olds , involving technical qualifications alongside gcses and a programme of work experience			1
the @entity108 last night stressed that a-levels were not going to be scrapped , but conceded that discussions were ongoing about plans to reform further education			0
a spokesman said : ‘ a-levels will not be replaced under any circumstances			0
there are public consultations about reforming @entity118 and as levels			0
‘ there are also numerous suggestions about new @entity123 league table measures but no decisions have been made			0

new @entity11 would see students studying a mixture of a-level subjects , writing a 5,000 - word essay and undertaking voluntary work
