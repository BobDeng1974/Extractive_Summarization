by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 prevailed 6 - 0 over @entity3 in a dour , try-less contest on saturday to seal the three - test series 2 - 0 and leave a subdued @entity7 crowd cold			1
in a low - quality clash littered with handling errors , second half penalties to fly - half @entity8 and scrumhalf @entity10 were enough for the @entity2 to seal a scrappy win despite perfect conditions under the closed roof of @entity17			1
having allowed the @entity2 to do what they pleased in the 50 - 23 opener in @entity20 , a more resolute @entity3 , complete with 10 changes to the starting lineup , had the better of a scoreless first half , though rarely posed any attacking threat until a last - gasp raid in the final minutes			1
close : @entity2 's @entity26 's ( left ) tries to evade a tackle during their narrow 6 - 0 win over @entity3 clash : @entity30 ( centre ) is tackled during the win gave @entity2 an unassailable 2 - 0 lead in the series playing in @entity7 , heartland of @entity36 , the @entity2 appeared determined to kick away possession , but derived little advantage from the tactic , and blew several promising drives with poor execution			2
@entity3 executed the first promising move , however , a kick forward in the third minute sparking a foot - race between @entity8 and fullback @entity45 to the line , but the @entity2 fly - half prevailed by inches to cut off the chance			2
the @entity2 were controversially denied what would have been the matchâ € ™ s opening try to number eight @entity53 on video review in the 22nd minute , prompting howls of derision from the @entity57 chipped kick from inside the @entity60 22 - yard line by inside centre @entity62 allowed @entity53 to touch down but in the wild scramble toward the line @entity62 was deemed to have tackled an opponent without the ball , though the contact was minimal and superfluous to the play			0
after @entity45 missed a long - range penalty in the opening quarter , scrumhalf @entity68 botched a second three minutes before the break , leaving both teams scoreless to halftime and a crowd of 27,000 frustrated			0
wrecking ball : @entity3 's outside centre @entity76 tries to break through @entity62 's tackle tight : the match was a nervy affair with neither side wanting to make a mistake and it lacked rhythm wallabies scrumhalf @entity10 repaid the favour twice in two minutes straight after the re-start , spraying the first kick wide and striking the post with the second , and though the rebound opened up a scoring chance out wide , the home side left it begging with a pass that sailed too high			0
@entity8 finally ticked the scoreboard over in the 53rd minute with a penalty kick from straight in front , drawing ironic cheers from the crowd			0
@entity3 was perhaps the more profligate , however , their few forays into the @entity100 € ™ half cut short by an errant pass or handling error			0
trip : @entity3 's tour to @entity2 will see them lose the series even if they clinch the final match an off - side penalty against replacement flanker @entity110 gave @entity10 a penalty he could not miss in the 65th minute but the scrum - half sprayed a simple chance to make it 9 - 0 with nine minutes left			1
@entity3 pushed in vain for a try in the final minutes , briefly rousing the unenthused crowd but the @entity2 cut off the threat to win their sixth successive match before next weekâ € ™ s final test in @entity120 .			2

the @entity2 seal the three - match series with a test to spare
second half penalties from @entity8 and @entity10 clinched *victory*
both sides were poor and the match was littered with handling errors
@entity2 won the series opener in @entity20 50 - 23 last weekend
