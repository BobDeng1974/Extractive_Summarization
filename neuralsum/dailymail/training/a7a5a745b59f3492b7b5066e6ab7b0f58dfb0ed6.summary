the parents of a gay son whose death they feel responsible for and who have dedicated their lives to helping members of the lgbtq community and their parents are being attacked by people who say they killed their son			1
@entity10 and @entity11 of @entity12 , @entity13 , learned their son @entity14 was gay when he came out to them at just 12 - years - old , but the devout @entity16 lived by the @entity17 , and as a result did everything they could to tech their son that he could fight his urges			1
in the end he could not , and @entity14 died of a drug overdose when he was just 20 - years - old , something they frequently write and speak about , expressing how ashamed they are and how much they wished they had done everything differently			1
after sharing their story however , @entity11 writes that she and her husband have been called ' f - king murderers , child abusers , people who should never have been parents , and self - obsessed narcissists , who demanded apologies from our son , without ever realizing that we were the ones who had wronged him			1
' they have also been told ' that we might as well have shot our son , point blank , before he came out , because that would have been more merciful than what we did do			0
' @entity11 responded to these attacks by saying she was shocked by the comments , but feels wretched and full of guilt and every single day realizes and has to live with the knowledge of how wrong she and her husband were in their treatment of their son			0
gone to soon : @entity53 ( above ) died of a drug overdose when he was 20 guilt : his parents , @entity11 and @entity57 ( above ) , feel partially responsible as they thought @entity14 should fight his homosexuality after coming out to them at just 12 - year - old fighting the urge : @entity14 would meet weekly with his pastor and attend reparative therapy in a bid to stop being gay the @entity66 now travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children			1
while they make it clear they never stopped loving their son , they do regret not accepting him for who he was			0
they encouraged him to fight his feelings while attending reparative therapy and meetings with his pastor weekly as a teenager			1
' basically , we told our son that he had to choose between @entity83 and his sexuality , ' said @entity11			2
and while this worked for some time , in the end @entity14 could not deny his sexuality			0
this led to him running off and using drugs when he was just a teenager they say , and going over a year without speaking to either of his parents			0
' suddenly our fear of @entity14 someday having a boyfriend ( a possibility that honestly terrified me ) seemed trivial in contrast to our fear of @entity14 â€™s death , especially in light of his recent rejection of @entity101 , and his mounting anger at @entity103 , ' wrote @entity11 on her @entity105 page			2
when @entity14 came back though after 18 long months , the family did accept him , and his boyfriends , but sadly their time together was short lived			2
just 10 months after returning @entity14 overdosed after a night out with his old friends			1
he died after 17 days in the hospital			0
memories : now @entity11 and @entity10 travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children @entity116 words : ' i grieve , not only for my oldest son , who i will miss every day for the rest of my life , but for the mistakes i made , ' wrote @entity11 on her @entity105 ' now , when i think back on the fear that governed all my reactions during those first six years after @entity14 told us he was gay , i cringe as i realize how foolish i was			1
i was afraid of all the wrong things , ' wrote @entity11			0
' and i grieve , not only for my oldest son , who i will miss every day for the rest of my life , but for the mistakes i made			0
i grieve for what could have been , had we been walking by faith instead of by @entity130			0
' @entity10 and @entity11 are now leaders of an @entity135 , contributors to the website @entity133 , have started an lgbtq group at their church , and speak out on behalf of the lgbtq community around the country .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 have devoted their lives to helping @entity16 parents accept their gay children after losing their gay son to an overdose
@entity53 came out to his parents when he was just 12 - years - old , but the devout @entity16 told him to fight his urges
@entity14 would meet with his pastor weekly and attend reparative therapy , but at 18 it became too much and he ran away
@entity14 was gone for 18 months and became *addicted* to drugs
10 months after he returned , and his parents mended their *relationship* with him , he died
the couple is now being called ' murderers and abusers who should have just shot their son and did not *deserve* to be parents '
