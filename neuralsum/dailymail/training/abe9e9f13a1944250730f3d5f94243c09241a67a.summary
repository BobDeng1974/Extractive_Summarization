by @entity0 a revolutionary breast implant - the lightest ever created - is due to be introduced in @entity2 later this year a revolutionary new breast implant – the lightest ever created – is due to be introduced in @entity2 later this year			1
the new implants , called @entity5 , will weigh 30 per cent less than any others on the market – and are designed to avoid the kind of sagging that can occur after time with conventional cosmetic breasts			1
up to now , implants have been made of weighty silicon gel or a saline water solution			1
the new type consists of a silicone shell filled with minute balls of silicate , a solid form of silicone gel , but much lighter			0
inventor @entity21 , an @entity22 biochemical engineer , said : ‘ breast implants have n’t got any lighter in weight since they were first introduced in 1962			1
there has been no change in what goes into an implant since day one			0
‘ we know that after ten or 15 years , these implants will need replacing			1
when you put an implant in , it is a dead weight			0
that ’s why they start to sag after a number of years and why women get through two or three sets if they want to maintain good - looking breasts			1
‘ we think it is important to make an implant as light as possible			0
’ the average conventional implant weighs just over 1lb , while the average real breast is slightly lighter than that			1
the new implant weighs a third less than than the conventional type			1
nearly 40 @entity22 women have already been fitted with the new breasts and say they hardly notice they are there			1
mr @entity21 was challenged to create the new implants by his brother @entity52 , an @entity22 plastic surgeon			2
@entity21 said : ‘ the feedback from our first patients is extremely positive			0
some of the women are having implants for the first time and they say they are lighter than their own natural breasts			1
‘ the breast still move naturally – from side to side – as they would if you saw a young woman on a beach walking along in a bikini			0
‘ any lighter and they would have taken off			0
and that would n’t have been natural			0
’ light touch : surgeon @entity71 created a breast ' like a young woman 's on a beach ' @entity75 , 27 , from @entity76 , who has had the surgery , said : ‘ my boobs were sagging because i had lost an enormous amount of weight			2
the only things that sagged after shedding 40 kilos [ 88lb ] were my boobs			0
‘ the result of the surgery is fantastic			0
i do n’t feel as if my breasts are there			2
they are fuller than before but not as heavy and i ’m still wearing the same - size bra			2
’ the new implants have been given @entity91 ‘ @entity92 ’ approval			2
surgeon @entity93 of the @entity95 hopes to start a trial this summer at his @entity98 practice .			0
