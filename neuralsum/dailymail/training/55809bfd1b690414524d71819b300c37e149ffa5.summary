by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:56 am on 12th july 2011 gaffe : @entity4 defense secretary @entity3 told troops they were fighting in @entity7 because of the 9/11 terror attacks the new defense secretary was left red - faced today after he told troops in @entity7 that they were stationed there because of the 9/11 terror attacks			1
@entity3 made the gaffe as he addressed around 150 soldiers at the @entity14 base in @entity15			2
that explanation was initially used by the former @entity18 administration to justify the invasion of @entity7 in 2003 , but has since been firmly dismissed by president @entity20 and the 9/11 commission			2
he told troops : ' the reason you guys are here is because of 9/11			0
the @entity4 got attacked and 3,000 human beings got killed because of @entity28			1
' we 've been fighting as a result of that			0
' the previous administration originally linked the september 11 attacks to former @entity7 dictator , @entity34			2
mr @entity3 's spokesman , @entity36 , moved quickly to correct the mistake , and added that his boss is a ' plain - spoken secretary ' , the @entity35 reports			0
he said : ' i do n't think he 's getting into the argument of 2002 - 2003			0
' ' he has made clear that the major threat to this country is coming from @entity28 and terrorist groups , and he has also made clear that wherever we are in the world today , that [ @entity28 ] is a principle reason for a military presence			0
' when pressed by reporters , he tried to explain his remarks by saying : ' i was n't saying , you know , the invasion - or going into the issues or the justification of that			0
first - hand experience : @entity4 secretary of defense @entity3 flies over @entity15 in a @entity58 helicopter alongside lieutenant general @entity59 , @entity60 of @entity61 in @entity7 ' it was more the fact that we really had to deal with @entity28 here , they developed a presence here and that tied in			1
' in the same address , he said that the @entity4 will take unilateral action against @entity73 militias armed by @entity74 who threaten @entity4 troops			1
last month 14 service members were killed in hostile incidents , the highest monthly toll in three years			0
mr @entity3 said : ' we are very concerned about @entity74 and the weapons they are providing to extremists here in @entity7			1
' despite @entity4 forces officially ending combat operations in @entity7 last august , troops have come under increasing fire in recent weeks			1
@entity4 officials blame @entity73 militias armed by @entity7 's @entity73 neighbour @entity74 for most of the recent attacks			1
rallying the troops : @entity3 addressing the troops in @entity15 at least three @entity4 service members have been killed this month , including one on sunday , the day @entity3 arrived in @entity15 on his first trip to @entity7 as defense secretary			1
@entity97 still has about 46,000 troops in @entity7 more than eight years after the 2003 invasion overthrew @entity101 dictator @entity34			1
forces are due to be withdrawn by the end of the year under a security pact between the two countries			0
in today 's address , mr @entity3 said : ' in june we lost a hell of a lot of @entity4 as a result of those attacks			1
and we can not just simply stand back and allow this to continue to happen			0
' @entity3 said @entity97 's first effort would be to press @entity7 to go after @entity73 groups responsible for the attacks			1
he is scheduled to meet @entity73 prime minister @entity116 later on today			0
referring to the right of @entity4 forces to defend themselves on @entity7 soil , he said : ' secondly , to do what we have to do unilaterally , to be able to go after those threats as well , and we 're doing that , ' hungry work : @entity3 reaches for mustard and relish to go with his hotdog during lunchtime at @entity14 in @entity15 general @entity130 , the commander of @entity4 forces in @entity7 , declined to comment on what specific measures unilateral action might involve			1
he said : ' i think what the secretary was pointing to was we 'll do what 's necessary to protect ourselves and that could include a host of things ... so we 'll just leave it at that , ' hours after @entity3 's arrival , militants fired three katyusha rockets into @entity15 's heavily fortified @entity148 , home to the massive @entity4 embassy complex and @entity7 government buildings , according to an @entity152 source officials , including @entity3 , have been pressing @entity15 to decide whether it wants @entity4 forces to stay beyond the year - end deadline			1
@entity116 has said he will abide by a decision of the majority of @entity7 's political leaders			0
shake on it : secretary of defence with troops at @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 forces in @entity7 now operate largely in the background , training and assisting @entity7 police and soldiers against a weakened but still lethal insurgency that launches hundreds of attacks each month			2
mr @entity3 , who as @entity172 director helped oversee the covert raid that killed @entity174 , said his number one priority since becoming defense secretary was to defeat @entity28			2
he told @entity178 last month there were still 1,000 @entity28 fighters in @entity7			0
his earlier blunder was not the first in his new job			0
during a visit to @entity163 on saturday , he told reporters that @entity4 plans to keep 70,000 troops there until 2014 - despite mr @entity20 's announcement last month that he would immediately begin to withdraw troops			2
mr @entity3 's office quickly retracted the remark .			0

14 @entity4 servicemen killed in june and rockets hit @entity148 within hours of his arrival
@entity3 tells troops @entity4 wo *nâ€™t* sit back and allow @entity74 to arm militants in @entity7
