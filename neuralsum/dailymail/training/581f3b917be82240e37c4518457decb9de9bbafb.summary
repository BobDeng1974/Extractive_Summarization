by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 07:00 est , 24 october 2012 @entity3 's surface tablet will cost between £ 399 and £ 559 when it goes on sale on october 26th , the firm said today			1
the price is the same as the cheapest third generation ipad , and will put the two firms into a head to head battle			2
the surface will go on sale the same day @entity3 releases @entity13 8 , the new version of its desktop computer software - and three days after @entity16 is expected to introduce a cheaper , mini version of its @entity8			1
based on a @entity25 chip designed by @entity26 , the @entity21 will run a simplified version of @entity28 that is not compatible with old @entity3 applications			1
however , the tablet will feature new app - style versions of @entity35 mainstays such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , and will include @entity40 games , video and music apps			0
the surface , with two cameras and a usb port , will be @entity46 only			0
@entity3 has made no mention of a wireless - enabled version			1
it will also launch just a day after @entity49 launches it popular range of @entity52 tablets in the @entity20 for the first time			1
experts say the price could lead to major problems for @entity3			2
the firm waited until today to reveal it , despite having unveiled the tablet last month			0
' it is priced the same as the @entity8 3 , even though the @entity21 has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the @entity8 's 16gb , ' said @entity64 of gadget website @entity65			1
' however , the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it 's a straight choice between an @entity8 and @entity21 , and i think the majority of people will choose an @entity8 - they just wo n't be aware of a spec fight			1
' ' if you 've used @entity76 is easier to use , but not many people have - and people love or hate it			0
' the software giant also showed the first tv ad for its tablet , heralding the start of what some believe could be a $ 400m ad push for @entity21 and @entity28			1
the dancing based ad was shown in a prime tv slot during the @entity4 version of @entity91			0
the advert begins with a single user snapping on the keyboard to a surface tablet			2
it then sees dozens of dancers creating a complex dance routine using the gadgets , with everyone from families to dancing schoolgirls using them			0
the adverts show choreographed dance routines using the tablet and its snap on keyboard cover the first advert focuses on the surface tablet 's keyboard , which @entity3 believes will give it an advantage over the @entity8 the latest adverts are expected to be the first of many as the firm makes final preparations for the launches of @entity28 and the surface tablet			1
some @entity4 experts believe the firm could have an advertising budget of up to $ 400m for the launch			0
yesterday the firm announced details of the music service the tablet will have , @entity127			0
although access to @entity3 's surface tablet has been tightly controlled , we were able to try the software it will run on a @entity134 tablet			1
the biggest problem @entity3 faces is , without doubt , first impressions			2
while everyone from toddlers to grannies can instantly use an @entity8 without being taught , the @entity13 software we used was a different story			2
it was confusing and unintuitive at first - with even the simplest task not easy to do without being shown how			0
it is , like @entity3 's mobile phone software , extremely slick and well though out once you get used to it - but the problem @entity3 faces is how to get consumers to give it a go , when the alternative is an @entity8 the entire family can instantly pick up and use			1
it boasts 30 million songs , with a free ad version and a paid £ 8.99 ( $ 9.99 ) version being available when @entity28 launches			1
the paid subscription is also required if you want to use @entity127 on the @entity160 game console or on smartphones that use @entity76			0
on the game console , an @entity163 membership is also required			0
current users of the @entity40 - about 66 million worldwide - will gradually be introduced to the service with a 30 - day free trial starting today			0
the ad is expected to be the first of many promoting the surface tablet			2

tablet to go on sale on october 26th , the same day @entity3 launches its @entity28 computer software
will launch three days after the expected *announcement* of @entity16 's ipad mini , and a day after @entity49 launches its fire tablets in the @entity20 .
surface with 32gb will cost the same as latest version of the @entity8 with 16gb of memory
@entity3 tablet comes with cover that doubles as a keyboard
