scientists believe they have discovered how to ' switch off ' autoimmune diseases , prompting hope the breakthrough could pave the way for a new treatment for multiple sclerosis			1
researchers at the @entity8 , who describe the work as an ' important breakthrough ' , say it could improve the lives of millions around the world			1
the study reveals how to stop cells from attacking healthy body tissue			1
the team discovered how cells convert from being aggressive to protecting against disease , rather than the body 's immune system destroying its own tissue by mistake			1
scientists at the @entity8 have discovered how to ' switch off ' autoimmune diseases , which they hope will pave the way for new treatments for multiple sclerosis			1
pictured is a brain scan of a patient with ms it is hoped the insight will lead to the widespread use of antigen - specific immunotherapy as treatment for many autoimmune disorders			0
conditions which could be affected by the research include multiple sclerosis ( @entity32 ) , type 1 diabetes , @entity45 ' disease and systemic lupus erythematosus			1
@entity32 alone affects around 100,000 people in the @entity48 and 2.5 million people worldwide			1
professor @entity50 , of the university 's @entity51 , led the ' exciting ' research - which was funded by the @entity54			0
' insight into the molecular basis of antigen - specific immunotherapy opens up exciting new opportunities to enhance the selectivity of the approach while providing valuable markers with which to measure effective treatment , ' professor @entity50 said			0
' these findings have important implications for the many patients suffering from autoimmune conditions that are currently difficult to treat			2
' in the study , scientists were able to selectively target the cells that cause autoimmune disease by dampening down their aggression against the body 's own tissue , while converting them into cells capable of protecting against disease			1
this type of conversion has previously been applied to allergies , in a treatment known as ' allergic desensitisation ' , but its application to autoimmune disorders has only recently been appreciated			2
the ' important breakthrough ' could have implications for millions of people who suffer @entity32 across the world , many of whom will become confined to a wheelchair as a result of the disease			1
file picture the researchers have now revealed how the administration of fragments of the proteins that are normally the target for the attack leads to correction of the autoimmune response			0
their work also shows that effective treatment can be achieved by gradually increasing the dose of antigenic fragment injected			2
@entity105 , executive director of policy and research at the @entity108 welcomed the new study			0
he said : ' this is a really interesting and encouraging study , and adds to our understanding of how scientists might be able to alter the way the immune system responds in people with @entity32 ' a previous trial of a similar therapy was unsuccessful in people with @entity32 , but this latest study , although conducted in mice , offers new options for future clinical trials that one day could lead to a low risk treatment for people with the condition			1
' in order to analyse how this type of immunotherapy works , the scientists looked inside the immune cells themselves to see which genes and proteins were turned off by the treatment			2
they found changes in gene expression that help explain how effective treatment leads to conversion of aggressor into protector cells			0
the outcome is to reinstate self - tolerance , where an individual 's immune system ignores its own tissues while remaining fully armed to protect against infection			0
researchers say that by specifically targeting the cells at fault , the immunotherapeutic approach avoids the need for immune suppressive drugs			0
these drugs are often associated with side effects such as infections , development of tumours and disruption of natural regulatory mechanisms			0
the treatment approach is currently undergoing clinical development through biotechnology company @entity160 , a spin - out from the @entity8			2
' sequential transcriptional changes dictate safe and effective antigen - specific immunotherapy ' is published in @entity165 today .			0
