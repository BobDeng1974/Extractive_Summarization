by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 11:44 est , 2 october 2012 a young @entity2 couple and their baby who fell desperately ill after moving into a newly purchased home have discovered that the house is a former meth lab that has been emitting highly toxic fumes ever since they moved in			1
@entity9 and @entity10 of @entity11 bought the property through foreclosure in the summer and though they recognised it was a fixer - upper , could never have predicted the traumatic events that would follow			2
within a matter of days , @entity9 began experiencing problems with her breathing and by week three of their occupancy , @entity22 and their infant son , @entity23 , had been struck with agonising sores , migraines and nose bleeds			1
happy days : @entity22 , @entity9 and baby @entity28 bought their foreclosed home in the summer for $ 36,000 but soon all three of them had fallen ill with breathing difficulty , migraines and mouth sores more than they bargained for : the @entity11 , @entity2 house on @entity35 was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property 's history oblivious to the connection , the couple were about to make a call to the doctor when a neighbour revealed the shocking truth about the home 's previous tenants and just as quickly as they had taken ill , their dream purchase became their nightmare			1
the owner of a coffee house and an @entity58 nurse , @entity53 and mrs @entity54 had bought the home from government - sponsored @entity60 ' we said , " it needs a little bit of love , but it 's got good bones , " ' @entity10 told @entity67			1
' we just had no idea that those bones were poisonous			0
' buying the home ' as is ' , they were informed of their responsibilities for detecting lead paint and asbestos hazards and chose not to bother with an inspection that would only point out superficial repairs anyway			0
superficial : before disaster struck , @entity10 and his two - year - old son @entity23 painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it good as new ? the @entity10 spent about $ 5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home neither brokers nor the @entity60 representatives warned them of any drug activity on the property so armed with paintbrushes and an optimism - illustrated in a happy family picture on the day of closing - the @entity10 moved into their new home			1
after hearing the news from their neighbour , a $ 50 testing kit proved that the house on 2427 @entity35 was not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 times higher than the @entity107 limit			1
wasting no time , mr @entity10 moved his wife and baby boy out of the property and into a rental			0
' the walls were poisoning us , ' he concluded as he lamented that the couple are now facing financial ruin			2
how a young couple could have been allowed to purchase such a dangerous home with no warning is part of a complicated legal story			0
decline : @entity54 , an @entity58 nurse , started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and @entity23 developed mouth sores innocence : @entity23 before he contracted mouth sores is one of the luckier children according to @entity129 of @entity130 who says he has spoken to families who children have died owing to the toxic fumes of meth though in 23 states including @entity2 , laws require seller to disclose if a property was ever used as a clandestine drug laboratory , @entity60 claims it had no idea of the @entity11 house 's history			1
and because they sold it ' as is ' to the @entity10 family , it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery			1
@entity60 spokesman @entity150 told @entity67 : ' we certainly empathize with the situation , but we had no prior information about the way the home had been used			2
if we had , of course , we would have disclosed it			0
' @entity129 of @entity130 , a company that does what it says on the label , admitted that even with disclosure laws , only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible ' you do n't always see the meth residue			1
' ' it 's extremely dangerous stuff ' he said of methamphetamine			0
home - style : a home - made meth lab likely similar to the one in the @entity10 home that a $ 50 tester kit revealed emitted fumes 80 times higher than the legal rate of contamination he also explained that information regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of foreclosure			1
according to mr @entity129 he receives calls from people in exactly the same position as the @entity10 every three to five minutes and recently heard from a man in @entity191 who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that killed his 14 - year - old daughter after two years			2
while sadly @entity191 has no disclosure laws , the meth lab expert said : ' i could tell you stories like that for days			2
' mr @entity10 meanwhile is less willing to let @entity60 off the hook for their part in the sale and vented his frustration on @entity205			0
before : mrs @entity54 and her family now face financial ruin as they are billed $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 for the clean - up on top of a mortgage and rent from the place they are living now peace : mr @entity10 , a coffee shop owner has posted an online petition asking @entity60 who sold them the house to shoulder the cost of the clean - up posting an online petition to try and hold them accountable for the costs of the clean up , he wrote : ' @entity60 advertises , " our qualifying homes come with a reviewed title , and a repaired living space making them easier to sell and improving home values in your territory			1
we sell our homes responsibly			0
@entity60 is committed to having the best property maintenance and sales standards in the country			0
" ' we had no reason to expect otherwise			0
instead , they irresponsibly sold us a ticking time bomb of dangerous chemicals without even telling us			0
' but attorneys are insisting that the ' as - is ' fine print is what will ultimately leave the $ 5,000 to $ 15,000 clean - up burden on mr @entity10 ' shoulders			2
a quote he has been given costs more than the house is worth .			0

@entity247 suffered nose bleeds , breathing problems , migraines and mouth sores before they discovered the shocking truth from a neighbour
@entity60 sold them the house but says it had no idea of the home 's history
under state law if the agency had been aware @entity60 would have had to disclose the property 's prior drug activity
meth lab clean - up expert says only one in ten labs are busted and the signs are almost *impossible* to detect in an empty home
the @entity10 family now faces financial ruin
