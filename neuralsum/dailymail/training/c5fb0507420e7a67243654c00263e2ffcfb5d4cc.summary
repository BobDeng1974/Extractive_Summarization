he is every council 's worst nightmare but artist @entity2 has a serious message to get across			1
this classically trained artist , who now lives in @entity6 , has been sneaking around cities across @entity8 in the middle of the night and strategically placing stickers on street signs to alter their meanings			1
and while passers - by may crack a smile when they see the humorous signage , @entity2 hopes people will think twice next time they are asked to follow an instruction			2
secret message : @entity2 uses road signs and alters their meanings to challenge the way we think thought - provoking : @entity2 's changed this sign so it appeared @entity23 was hanging on a dead - end sign not everyone has been impressed with the signs and @entity2 was reportedly fined 400 euros in one city @entity2 's thought - provoking works of guerrilla art hope to challenge the way society restricts itself with rules and regulations			2
he believes signs are stopping individual expression and thought and many of his pieces of work make reference to religion			0
in one a black silhouette sneakily carries off a no - entry bar while in another a crucified @entity23 hangs on a dead - end sign			0
however , not everyone has been impressed			0
the artist , armed with his trusty pack of stickers , was reportedly once fined 400 euros for vandalising street signs			1
creative : @entity2 believes signs often treat people as idiots and can verge on the absurd challenging : many will think @entity2 's art is fun but every piece has a serious message too @entity2 hopes people driving in their cars will stop and take note of the hidden meanings in his art @entity64 told website @entity65 : ' the omnipresence of street signs can verge on the absurd			1
' the message is very poor ( sometimes i feel like i â€™m being treated like an idiot by them ) and yet they have a highly invasive aesthetic			0
' as a professional in the world of visual space , i feel called to intervene , both to notify the public of the absurdity of the situation , and to propose a constructive and respectful alternative			0
' the final objective ? that traffic keeps flowing without us feeling spoken down to ! ' @entity2 's art is a comment on the way people are restricted by rules surprise : @entity2 works in the middle of the night so no one can catch him altering the signs			2
