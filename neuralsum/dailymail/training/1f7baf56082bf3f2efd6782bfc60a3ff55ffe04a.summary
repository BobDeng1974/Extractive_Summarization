by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 17:07 est , 16 august 2012 the @entity1 has said that president @entity2 will not jettison vice-president @entity3 and replace him with @entity4 as his 2012 running mate			1
republicans such as senator @entity7 and governor @entity8 had suggested @entity3 be replaced by @entity9 after the furore over @entity3 ’s comments to an audience containing many blacks that @entity6 intended to ‘ put y’all back in chains ’			1
asked whether @entity3 would definitely be on the ticket , @entity16 , @entity1 spokesman , said : ‘ yes			2
and that was settled a long , long time ago			0
‘ and while i appreciate , i have great admiration for and respect for and a long relationship with senator @entity7 , but one place i would not go for advice on vice-presidential running mates is to @entity7			0
’ lost your appetite , @entity27 ? president @entity2 and his vp had lunch today following @entity3 's inflammatory comments to a black audience earlier this week @entity2 had a @entity1 meeting with @entity3 followed by a joint meeting between the two men and @entity9			1
the president and vice-president then had lunch together , during which recent campaign events were discussed			0
ahead of the meeting the @entity2 camp said the president would be ' talking to him a whole lot about the campaign '			2
the vice-president ’s lunch with the president is a regularly scheduled event but you can be sure that @entity3 was expecting to be taken to the woodshed by @entity2 , who was forced to defend his hapless veep in interviews with @entity54 and @entity55			1
he told people : ' @entity3 has been an outstanding vice president			2
he is passionate about what 's happening in middle - class families			0
so i will be talking to him a whole lot about the campaign generally			0
' breaking the ice ? secretary of state @entity4 was set to meet with @entity2 and @entity3 before their lunch today he told @entity55 that @entity3 's ' phrasing is a distraction ' - a clear sign of his dismay about his vice-president 's loose lips			1
' what @entity3 was talking about again is an example of a substantive argument - a substantive issue , that the @entity76 people should be concerned about — and his phrasing is a distraction from what is at stake			2
' he added : ' in no sense was he trying to connote something other than that			0
' when a president is forced to explain what his veep was ' trying to connote ' , you know things between them are unlikely to be all warm and fuzzy			0
right at the start of his presidency , @entity2 made clear that he did not appreciate @entity3 's garrulous jocularity			1
when @entity3 joked about chief justice @entity94 's mistake in administering the inauguration oath of office , a stony - faced @entity2 was distinctly unamused			1
@entity2 held a meeting with @entity3 at 10.15 this morning followed by a session in which they were joined by @entity4 , @entity76 secretary of state			1
president and veep are then due to have lunch together at 12.30pm			0
speculation that this could be a sign that @entity9 will replace @entity3 on the 2012 ticket is highly unlikely to be anything beyond mischief - making and excessive optimism among @entity6			2
although , @entity2 still has until the convention in @entity109 to change his running mate , to ditch @entity3 at this point would be such a sign of panic and desperation that the president would in all likelihood plummet in the polls			1
@entity9 , who could well be the @entity119 front runner in 2016 whether @entity2 is re-elected or not , would be highly unlikely to want to take @entity3 's spot			2
if an @entity2 - @entity9 ticket lost , the former first lady would be in a worse position than she is now to secure the 2016 nomination			0
even if the ticket won and she became veep - often a strong position from which to win the @entity1 - her association with @entity2 could be a political millstone by in four years ’ time			0
vice-president @entity3 controversially told an audience made up of several hundred black supporters that @entity131 would put ' y'all back in chains ' with his @entity135 financial deregulation plans			1
the comments were made to an audience of 800 at the @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140 on monday .			0

@entity2 and @entity3 met with @entity4 ahead of their lunch
@entity3 told audience of black supporters that @entity131 would put ' y'all back in chains ' with his @entity135 financial deregulation plans earlier this week
