by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 16:32 est , 27 october 2012 it was third time unlucky for @entity3			1
eight years ago she twisted her knee jumping out of a horse box			1
four years later she hurt it again while walking her dog			2
each time , @entity3 limped for a few days but did n’t go to hospital			1
however , on the third occasion in spring last year she knew it was serious			2
‘ i was standing up from putting washing in the tumble dryer when i heard an almighty bang in my knee and i doubled over in agony , ’ she recalls			1
@entity3 , 35 , had become a victim of one of the most common injuries suffered by @entity20			1
every year one in 600 people damage or rupture their anterior cruciate ligament ( @entity23 ) , one of the four ligaments that stabilise the knee joint			1
over the agony : six months after the ' origami ' surgery to her knee , @entity3 can ride her horses again traditional treatment involves grafting two hamstring tendons – from the three that run down the back of the leg – into the knee joints to replace the acl			1
the drawback is that it can significantly reduce the strength of the leg			2
now an operation called the @entity44 technique for @entity45 is transforming the prospects of patients , reducing recovery time and increasing leg strength			2
it has also been dubbed the origami technique as it involves folding over just one hamstring tendon four times to make it stronger			1
the knee is the largest joint in the body			1
the thigh and shin bones form a hinge joint , and the patella , or knee cap , sits over them and slides as the leg moves			1
the ligaments are crucial to this structure			0
these are strong , fibrous cables of tissue connecting the bones			0
the anterior cruciate ligament runs diagonally from front to back within the knee			1
one of the major problems with acl injury is that it is often not picked up until the problem is severe			0
‘ the injury tends to occur on the sports field – playing football , hockey , netball or rugby , ’ says mr @entity77 , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity78 , @entity79			0
‘ damage is usually caused by a twisting movement , such as changing direction suddenly			0
many people go to accident and emergency but 90 per cent of the time an x-ray comes back clear so they are sent home			0
’ although the swelling goes down , the patient often sees a gp within a few weeks because of continuing pain			0
‘ they may or may not be referred to a knee specialist , but by the time they get an appointment they are five or six months down the line , ’ says mr @entity77			1
‘ should they be fortunate enough to be referred for a repair , by the time the operation is performed it may have been 18 months since the original injury			1
’ not only will patients have been in a great deal of pain but they may also have suffered irreparable damage to the knee joint – including cartilage tears and joint - surface damage			1
‘ an operation will halt the process of deterioration and stabilise the knee , ’ says mr @entity77			1
‘ left untreated , patients will eventually need a knee replacement			1
’ mr @entity77 ’s new technique , which he developed mainly at @entity78 with his @entity126 team , uses just one hamstring tendon			0
he says : ‘ taking two significantly reduces hamstring strength and it takes a year to recover			0
our technique takes half the time to recover			0
everyone limps for a few weeks , but after six months our patients are pretty much back to normal			1
’ the operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic			0
first the surgeon makes a keyhole incision about 2in below the knee on the inside			1
through that , a long spear - like instrument is inserted and used to cut a single hamstring from the bone at either end			0
‘ we used to make a large incision from knee to groin to locate and take out the hamstring , ’ says mr @entity77			1
‘ but we have found that by cutting the point that anchors the tendon to the bone , we can slide the hamstring out			0
it ’s a flat ribbon , about 1cm wide and 0.5mm thick – a bit like pappardelle pasta			0
’ next , the surgeon removes the broken acl and drills a socket where it once attached to either side of the knee joint			2
‘ the hamstring is folded four times , a bit like origami , and stitched together to make it very strong , ’ says mr @entity77			2
‘ sutures are attached at either end , and these are fed through a thinner tunnel a couple of millimetres in diameter , then anchored to the outside of the knee with little buttons			2
’ mr @entity77 has performed it on more than 150 patients and interest in the technique is growing globally			0
@entity3 is one of the lucky few to have benefited so far			1
after her collapse in the spring , her boyfriend , @entity181 , 47 , who works in @entity182 , drove her to hospital			0
@entity3 says : ‘ they said there was nothing broken and gave me a metal brace which reached from ankle to thigh			1
even after a week , i ’d walk a few steps and my knee would wobble			2
’ a physiotherapist she saw a fortnight later referred her for an mri scan			0
‘ i had to wait two months for this , and then a further seven for the operation			2
’ during this time @entity3 wore the knee brace constantly			1
‘ i could n’t walk far			0
to hold the knee straight it had to be fastened tightly so it was very uncomfortable			2
’ normally very active – riding her two horses daily , cycling to work and walking her dog – @entity3 says she lost a stone through muscle - wastage			1
everything i took for granted had gone			0
i felt depressed , ’ she admits			0
when she heard of mr @entity77 ’s operation , she decided to go for it			0
‘ i met someone who had undergone the old operation and they were left limping			0
i just wanted to get back to normal			0
after the operation , i felt no pain at all and was on my feet within 12 hours			0
the knee felt solid and firm and i could walk with crutches			2
’ although she was absent from her office job for two weeks , @entity3 was able to spend the following month at work with her feet up on a box of files			1
‘ my boyfriend looked after the horses and walked the dogs , but i ’ve been riding again for a few weeks now and it ’s fantastic to be back in the saddle , ’ she says .			2

@entity3 had ' origami ' surgery to her knee after damaging a ligament
six months later she can ride her horses again
