by @entity1 reporter published : 10:18 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:40 est , 7 august 2013 the autopsy of a young woman whose body was found in the @entity5 after she disappeared while rafting through the @entity6 has revealed that she had been drinking excessively at the time of her death			1
the body of @entity10 , who turned 21 during the month - long rafting trip that lead to her death , was found in late march after a two - month search following her january 11 disappearance			1
previous reports speculated that she may have taken hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time of her death , since she was said to have brought them on the rafting trip with her , but the autopsy showed that she only had alcohol in her system			1
worst fear confirmed : officials found the body of @entity26 , 21 , in the @entity5 , two months after disappearing during a rafting trip with friends even still , her apparent decision to drink during the trip comes in contrast to her journal entries where she wrote about the dangers of imbibing while on a self - guided rafting trip			1
' drinking out of control or to the point of unconsciousness is probably the most dangerous thing we can be doing out there , ' she wrote in a journal entry dated four days before she disappeared			2
' she might just have wanted to let loose , ' her brother @entity42 told the @entity43 , even though he said she was not a big drinker			0
@entity10 was on the trip with a group of friends and they had boxes of wine and beer among their supplies			2
no drugs : @entity10 had brought hallucinagenic mushrooms on the trip with her and taken some in the days leading up to her death but the autopsy did n't show any traces in her system on that fateful night the friends told investigators that they also shared whiskey with a passing group who visited them at their campsite			1
in the days leading up to her disappearance on the night of january 11 , @entity10 had eaten some of the hallucinogenic mushrooms that she brought with her , but their effects would have likely worn off by the time she walked away from the campfire that fateful night			1
her friends told the @entity43 that aside from walking away from the campsite unannounced on the night of the 11th , her unusual behavior started much earlier in the day			0
@entity10 , who was an accomplished musician , woke up 30 minutes earlier than the rest of her group and went on a walk upstream , bringing her mandolin with her			2
free spirit : @entity10 was an anthropology major at @entity82 and an accomplished musician who played the fiddle and the mandolin firm clues : the autopsy report said that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 at the time of her death , which is significantly higher than the legal driving limit of 0.8 her body was found floating in the river two months later			1
she was back by breakfast , and the day carried on as normal except that friends reported that she began slurring her words as the day went on , with her speech becoming more and more incoherent			0
another witness said that she was acting out of character			0
that night , the group divided into smaller pairings around the campfire , and as they were going to bed no one noticed that she had n't gone into a tent			0
gone : @entity105 was rafting through the @entity6 's waterways when she vanished without a trace the next morning they realized she was gone			0
a two month search ensued , with their biggest lead being the single set of footprints that led them downriver			0
the prints - which showed one boot mark and one bare footprint - stopped about a half - mile away from the camp			0
her body was found floating in the river two months later .			2

@entity10 @entity26 was found 30 miles from the spot where she was last seen january 11
witnesses found her footprints headed down river the morning after she *wandered* off while her friends were *gathered* at the campfire
autopsy proves she had a blood alcohol level of 0.11 , which is notably above the legal driving limit of 0.08
she had taken hallucinogenic mushrooms days prior
