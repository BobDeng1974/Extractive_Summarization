by @entity0 published : 03:45 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 22 august 2013 a former prisoner has justified her £ 20,000 sex change by claiming the @entity3 wastes money on cancer sufferers			1
@entity6 , 37 , formerly known as @entity7 , was born in @entity8 , @entity9 , with both male and female genitals and was raised as a girl called @entity12 until she was eight			1
then she said she was encouraged by her parents to live as a boy called @entity7 and says she felt pressured to be ' macho ' by her father			2
former burglar @entity6 , previously known as @entity7 , has had a £ 20,000 sex change on the @entity3 as a result of this gender confusion , she claims she started hanging around with a bad element and took her first steps into a life of crime to try and appear more macho			1
in 1994 , aged 18 , she was jailed for burglary for the first time			0
she spent the next few years in and out of prison until may 2006 when , while serving an 11 - year stretch for a string of burglaries , she told a prison nurse she was transex and wanted to live a new life as a woman			1
since then the @entity3 has spent £ 20,000 on sex change operations and treatments for @entity6			2
before : as @entity35 , who served a number of prison sentences for burglary she said : ' the @entity3 wastes money helping people with cancer , often smokers , even though their condition is terminal and they are going to die whereas i 've got years left			2
' @entity6 told @entity47 her condition was as ' life - threatening as cancer ' because of high suicide rates among the transgender community , adding that giving him the treatment was cost - effective as she would otherwise be too depressed to work and instead claim benefits			1
@entity6 , who works for a charity that helped her with the sex change , has a 16 - year - old son from one relationship and two children from a marriage to a different woman , who are now nine and 10			1
when she - then a he - was alone with his eldest son , she would pretend to be the child 's mother and wore her girlfriend 's clothes			0
she no longer sees her children			0
after the breakdown of the marriage and she was moved to an open prison , @entity6 applied to the @entity3 for cash for gender reassignment			2
hormone tablets made her grow breasts , a charity donated women 's clothes and make up and £ 18,000 from the @entity3 paid for electrolysis and laser treatment to remove body hair , followed by surgery to transform her genitals			0
although the @entity3 refused to pay for breast enhancement , she has since had surgery to gain a 36e chest - claiming her sex life has ' gone wild ' since the op. she said : ' people might be angry , but i had a condition that needed treating			1
' i feel awful about my criminal past and i 'm so sorry to those i hurt during that time			0
i 'd never step on the wrong side of the law again - i 'm living the dream			0
' an @entity97 spokesperson said : ' it is up to the @entity3 locally to decide what treatments to provide and all decisions made about gender identity services are based on an individual clinical assessment			0
' prisoners have the right to receive the same range and quality of @entity3 treatments and services as anyone else , including gender identity services			0
