@entity0 scored his first league goal for @entity2 as the club prepared for the @entity5 era with a win that keeps alive their top - four hopes and leaves @entity9 staring at a relegation battle			1
@entity12 ’s 25 - year association with @entity13 is not quite over yet , but this was the first match played since official confirmation that he will leave for @entity19 side @entity18 at the end of this season and , at 34 , he will certainly not be playing every game until then			0
as if to underline his susceptibility , he was withdrawn at half - time yesterday as a precaution with a minor hamstring ailment			0
@entity0 , a 20 - year - old @entity27 who cost £ 20million when bought from @entity29 and various third parties last summer , was set up by a pass from @entity12 for the goal			1
the assist was symbolic as well as practical ; it will be @entity0 ’s generation who will now be required to step up and fill the void about to be created not just by @entity12 ’s technical contributions but his leadership			1

@entity2 later failed to punish 10 - man @entity9 after @entity90 gave a soft second yellow to @entity54			1
‘ i thought we were outstanding in the first half , ’ said @entity2 manager @entity38			1
he praised his team ’s ‘ control ’ and ‘ tempo ’ and pressing game			0
‘ we should have had a clear penalty , we hit the crossbar and created other clear - cut chances , ’ he said			2
@entity2 have lost just one game now in their last 13 matches in all competitions and one in nine in the @entity45			1
this win leaves them in eighth place , four points behind the coveted @entity119 slots			0
they will , however , need to up their game if they are to mount a realistic challenge			0
@entity38 can at least look forward to returning players , with @entity123 getting closer after thigh and calf problems and @entity126 due back from a mid-season holiday			0
@entity38 has given @entity126 , 20 , some time off to rest and the player has been soaking up some winter sun on holiday in @entity132			0
he will be back next week			0
‘ in my two and a half years here , he has gone from youth team to full international , ’ said @entity38 , explaining the rationale for @entity126 ’s break			0
‘ i need to think of the kid for himself and for @entity2 in the long term			1
it was a good time to give him a rest and he ’ll be back fresh for the rest of the season			0
’ @entity38 also had praise for @entity0 , who he insisted will have a ‘ big , big future ’			2
@entity54 was given his marching orders four minutes after half - time for two bookings @entity54 tripped can as he marauded down the right into space to pick up his second yellow card former @entity154 winger @entity55 smashed the bar in the second half as @entity9 sought an equaliser @entity77 weaves his way beyond @entity159 during his return to the @entity161 for the @entity162 @entity77 rounded the @entity9 goalkeeper but was n't able to supply the finish which would 've made it 2 - 0 @entity79 was busy in an attacking sense ( pictured gliding beyond @entity50 in the first half ) things look less bright for @entity9 , with just one win in 11 league games — and that not since the start of october against @entity171			1
this was the tenth league game of the season ( out of 21 ) in which they have failed to score			0
‘ the feeling is not good , ’ said manager @entity69			0
‘ we played poorly for 45 minutes of a very important game and , when you do that against a team like @entity2 , you ’ll get punished			2
’ he then implied criticism of referee @entity90 , agreeing that ‘ by the rules ’ yellow cards should be handed out for certain actions that inhibit attacking play			0
this was a reference to @entity54 ’s second booking , a soft card for the slightest contact with @entity191			2
@entity69 then said that , by the rules , @entity2 ’s @entity79 should also have had two yellows			2
‘ you referee by the rules or you referee by common sense , ’ he said , implying @entity90 had not used common @entity194 also confirmed he would try to buy a striker in the transfer window to address @entity9 ’s chronic lack of goals			2
‘ i ’ll not give too much information away , ’ he said			0
’ @entity2 ’s goal came after a decent phase of interplay ended with @entity0 running on to a ball from @entity12 and slotting past @entity43			1
@entity2 dominated for long periods of the first half , limiting a poor @entity9 to set - pieces and speculative long - range efforts			1
@entity0 later struck the crossbar with this volley as @entity2 took control of the game in the north - east the game was shrouded in controversy after @entity90 did n't give @entity2 an early penalty for this @entity52 challenge captain @entity12 could n't believe the decision and made his feelings known to the official @entity73 hit a post after getting a shot away under the attention of @entity57 @entity54 unfairly challenges @entity12 from behind and concedes a free - kick in the opening 45 minutes @entity59 dashes beyond a startled @entity72 as @entity9 looked to get a foothold in the game @entity52 struggles to keep control of @entity78 as the @entity232 skips by the central defender			1

@entity0 scored his first @entity45 goal for @entity2 in the ninth minute
@entity54 was sent off for the hosts for two bookings while @entity55 struck the crossbar
@entity9 were booed by their fans despite being down to 10 men
