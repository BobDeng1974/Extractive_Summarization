@entity0 are determined to ensure their season does not end with a whimper , according to defender @entity3			1
the @entity0 ' once promising campaign has tailed off , with a run of just one win in 11 @entity8 games seeing the club slip from @entity11 contention to mid-table			1
their latest disappointing result came at @entity14 on sunday as they went down to an insipid 2 - 0 defeat			1
@entity3 holds off the challenge from @entity17 during @entity0 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity14 @entity0 defender @entity3 challenges @entity20 during the clash at the @entity22 on sunday with @entity23 now not realistic and relegation not an issue , the @entity0 would now seem to have little to play for but @entity3 insists the remaining five games are not meaningless			1
the 23 - year - old , who has enjoyed a successful season - long loan from @entity29 and could make the switch permanently , said : ' people in our dressing room are fired up			1
if you came in the changing room after the game you 'd see that			0
' people are n't resting on their laurels , people ai n't happy finishing mid-table			1
we want to kick on			0
we have got something to prove now because we have been on a bad run of games and we want to put that right			2
we owe that to ourselves and the fans			0
' @entity0 were never in the game at the @entity22 , losing after a bizarre own goal from @entity48 and a swift counter-attack strike from @entity50 before half - time			1
@entity48 scored a comical own goal to give @entity14 the lead on sunday @entity54 and @entity55 did have late chances after @entity14 lost momentum following injury to @entity59 but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest			1
@entity3 felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season			1
he said : ' i would n't want to blame it on luck but a few things have n't gone our way lately and we have conceded some late goals			0
' i think this was a different story - we made a couple of mistakes and got punished			2
@entity50 doubled the lead for the champions as they ran out comfortable winners ' of course we have got to work on our performances but if you look at the last 10 games , our performances have n't been bad at all			2
' we have had some really good performances but teams have scored late goals against us and we have ended up getting a point instead of three			0
it has been a bit frustrating			0
' i just think early on in the season we were finishing everything			2
everything we got was going in the back of net and at important times of the game			0
' we have gone ahead in recent games but never killed the games off and have ended up conceding cheaply towards the end of the game			0
of course that is a real kick in the teeth			0
' it is not nice blaming things on luck - you make your own luck - but that has been the story of our last couple of months			0
