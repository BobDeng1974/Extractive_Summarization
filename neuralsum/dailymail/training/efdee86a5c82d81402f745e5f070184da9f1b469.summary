it was supposed to be a routine job , police say			0
move 69 prisoners from an outlying town to a jail in southern @entity5			1
but before they arrived at their destination , every single prisoner had been killed			0
but mystery surrounds the massacre			1
according to some sources , it ’s likely that they were killed to prevent them joining the rebellion			1
the official account , though , given hours after the killing on monday by the governor of @entity18 , 92km ( 57 miles ) south of @entity5 , was that militants had attacked the convoy killing 10 prisoners and one policeman in the crossfire			1
pictured are terrorist fighters of the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) @entity28 soldiers take up position at @entity47 , near the @entity28 borders with @entity49 on friday @entity28 government troops launched airstrikes against @entity53 - led insurgents in @entity54 on friday , a day after the military claimed to have retaken the northern city 's university from the rebels ‘ the convoy protection force fiercely responded to the terrorist attack , ’ governor @entity59 told reporters			1
but a police captain , a second police officer and a senior local official from where the prisoners died in @entity18 , all speaking on condition of anonymity while giving an account that differed from the official line , told @entity73 no attack took place , and the police had executed the 69 men			1
a third police source who would not contradict the account that the convoy had come under attack nevertheless confirmed that all 69 had been killed and said some had not died in the crossfire but were gunned down to prevent them from escaping			1
the deaths in @entity18 came less than a week after the killing of 52 prisoners in @entity87 , a regional capital north of @entity5			1
the police account of that incident also said that the prisoners had died in crossfire during a battle with insurgents			1
but local @entity30 officials including the mayor and the provincial governor , medical staff at the morgue and relatives of the dead all said the victims were gunned down in their jail cells			2
@entity28 's government has long denied it summarily executes prisoners			0
following a @entity73 report on police executions in march , army spokesman @entity105 said : ‘ if it happened , whoever committed it will be investigated , held accountable and sent to a military court			0
’ location : the massacre took place in @entity18 , to the south of @entity5 conflict : members of the @entity117 brigades , who volunteered to protect the @entity26 holy sites in @entity120 against @entity30 militants fighting the @entity5 government , parade in the streets of the @entity125 on june 26 @entity126 and other @entity28 government spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the latest killings outside @entity18			1
unlike the @entity28 government , @entity30 insurgents from the @entity31 make no attempt to hide mass executions of prisoners : they proudly proclaim that @entity26 are heretics who must die , and boast of the killings			1
days after they began sweeping through northern cities on june 10 , they released videos showing their masked fighters machine gunning captive government soldiers lying in shallow graves			0
on friday , @entity141 said @entity31 had executed at least 160 people in @entity54 this month			2
but the reports that government forces loyal to prime minister @entity145 are also executing prisoners are becoming more regular as the conflict intensifies , calling into question @entity150 's stepped - up military support for the @entity26 premier			2
several police sources interviewed by @entity73 said prisoners were being preemptively killed in @entity28 to prevent militant groups from freeing them to rejoin the rebellion			1
@entity28 security forces patrol after clashes with the predominantly @entity30 militants from the radical @entity31 in the town of @entity160 in @entity161 on thursday ‘ we feed them and keep them healthy and if the @entity31 managed to free them , they will immediately resume fighting us , ’ the police captain who acknowledged the executions in @entity18 said			1
‘ we have to defend ourselves by executing those criminals			0
’ the second @entity18 police officer said summary executions were routinely carried out by army and police forces			0
‘ first thing we do is to shoot them in the foot and then take their confessions			0
then we kill them and write in report they were killed in action , ’ he said , also on condition of anonymity			0
the third police officer , who denied that the @entity18 prisoners were executed , nevertheless said the reason some of the 69 had been shot was to prevent them from escaping			1
he said the convoy had been hit by a roadside bomb and came under fire			0
‘ we are not an execution squad			0
what happened was that we were trying to transport high - profile , dangerous members of @entity194 - most of them awaiting death sentences - to another secure detention centre south of @entity5 , ’ he said			1
‘ the convoy came under attack by militants who set off two roadside bombs			2
some of the prisoners wanted to use the attack to escape			2
we shot them dead as they were escaping			0
’ a senior local official in @entity18 said the attack on the convoy had been staged to hide the execution			1
‘ the police brought the bodies of 16 other terrorists they had executed earlier to the scene and laid weapons by their corpses to pretend they had attacked the convoy , ’ he said			1
one of @entity31 's main aims is to free @entity30 prisoners from government jails , and @entity28 police and troops who guard them come under frequent attack			1
a year ago @entity31 launched its biggest military operation in years , attacking two jails			0
hundreds of convicts , including senior members of @entity194 , were freed from @entity229 jail on @entity5 's western outskirts in the assault , which saw suicide bombers blast through the gates			2
when militants took @entity237 city on june 10 at the start of their present offensive , they freed as many as 1,000 prisoners from a jail			0
the government 's harsh justice towards prisoners did not begin with this month 's @entity31 advance , however			2
in a @entity73 investigation in march , a police officer , an army officer , a general and an @entity28 @entity251 member all said that in western @entity253 province @entity28 troops had begun replying in kind to @entity31 , carrying out extra-judicial executions , torture and humiliations of their enemy and posting images of the results online			2
on june 4 , a week before the assault on @entity237 , the chief of police in @entity18 held a news conference to display six captives , charged with a car bomb attack that killed 14 people			2
the prisoners confessed in front of cameras to having bombed @entity18 hospital			0
hours later , police chief major general @entity272 posted pictures of the bullet - riddled bodies of four of the suspects on his @entity277 page			0
he said they had been killed when unidentified assailants opened fire while they were being escorted to cells , but expressed no regret at the death of captives in his custody			0
‘ delighted that divine justice has been achieved against them , ’ @entity272 wrote on @entity277 .			0
