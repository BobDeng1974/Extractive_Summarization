@entity0 defeated @entity1 3 - 1 on tuesday night 's ' friendly ' at @entity2 thanks to headers in each half from @entity5 and @entity6 , who then finished his second to snuff out an @entity9 - led fight back from the hosts			1
@entity12 's @entity11 soaked up the atmosphere in @entity14			0
@entity16 ’s famous line – ‘ welcome to @entity1 ? you must be f * * * * * * joking ! ’ – looked a little anachronistic when the @entity0 coach arrived			2
there were a few pantomime boos but @entity21 emerged beaming alongside @entity6 and a small crowed attempting to abuse the @entity0 captain got little encouragement from their peers			1
@entity0 captain @entity6 and coach @entity21 arrive at @entity2 to some pantomime boos @entity21 holds a bottle of @entity28 as he shares a laugh with a @entity1 fan ahead of the match things got a little feistier inside @entity2 , where the pre-match parade of flags saw the @entity36 ’s cross predictably booed , prompting one flag bearer – presumably @entity38 - to make a friendly gesture to the crowd which might have been a v for victory sign			1
and the @entity44 ’s pleas for respect for both anthems to be respected ‘ especially @entity0 ’s ’ was , shall we say , not strictly adhered to			0

they spent a good part of the first half singing a song about their opposition to the @entity64 – enthusiastically accompanied by their official band – to the apparent bemusement of most @entity1 fans			2
@entity0 fans sang about their opposition to the @entity64 at @entity2 to the bemusement of the @entity72 stewards attempt to round up a pitch invader wearing a kilt and @entity1 shirt pre-match entertainment rarely strays beyond the banal and the cliche			1
but at least the @entity80 ' i 'm @entity81 ) injected a little life into proceedings and it was a cut above @entity85 ’s standard fare of @entity86			0
that said , manufactured ‘ atmosphere ’ remains an anathema compared to the real thing			0
former @entity0 managers never disappear			0
they can be relied upon to re-emerge abroad with a lucrative contract and @entity93 was unveiled as the new coach of @entity95 on a reported £ 3.8m - a - year contract that puts him among the top earners in football management			0
at least @entity21 had his foreign jaunts prior to taking the @entity0 job former @entity0 boss @entity93 is unveiled as the managed of @entity101 's @entity95			2

@entity0 beat @entity1 3 - 1 at @entity2 on tuesday night
@entity0 fans sang about the @entity64 at @entity2 to @entity1 's bemusement
@entity21 's side arrived to pantomime boos from a small crowd
