resigned : @entity11 , 20 , resigned after the @entity13 first aid and @entity18 suspended him for driving the squad 's ambulance the @entity13 first aid and @entity18 's rules dictate that ambulance drivers must be at least 21 years of age			1
in a 4 - 3 decision , the board decided to suspend @entity11 , who is also a volunteer firefighter and part - time police officer , for 60 days			1
upset by the decision , @entity11 immediately tendered his resignation			2
the board 's decision has caused an outcry in the community , where people feel the young @entity10 should not be penalized for helping a child			1
according to the @entity36 , @entity11 was at the @entity13 first aid and @entity18 's headquarters when the call came in about a four - year - old having seizures			1
a paramedic soon arrived at the child 's home in an suv and called for an ambulance			2
@entity11 , alone at headquarters , called the @entity47 , but they were busy on another call			0
he then called three more ambulance services over the next 15 minutes but came up empty - handed , so he climbed into the ambulance himself , drove the five miles to the child 's house and took the child , his mother and the paramedic to @entity56			2
' i would n't have been able to sleep at night or go to school knowing there 's a four - year - old suffering , ' @entity11 told the @entity36			1
the following monday , he was called before the board of directors and asked to explain himself			0
@entity11 says he believes he made the best decision and that although he is only 20 , he has experience driving ambulances for the @entity65			1
the board decided to suspend him for 60 days and revoke his title of advisor from the @entity69 , which he had restarted when he joined the volunteers as a 15 - year - old			1
@entity11 quit his position and soon after a post about the whole episode was posted on the @entity76 fire / rescue facebook page			0
it soon went viral , with more than 400 comments , most in support of @entity11 , and 1,300 ' likes			0
' captain and board member for @entity13 first aid services tells a slightly different story from @entity11 's			1
@entity86 said @entity11 's suspension came about not as the result of an isolated incident , but from a ' culmination of different incidents , ' as well as other aspects of the december 11 call			1
community - minded : @entity11 is a part - time police officer , volunteer firefighter and until recently volunteer @entity10 the @entity96 reports that @entity11 was at the squad 's station at around 10:45am on december 11 with another emt and an ambulance driver when the call came in about the four - year - old having seizures			1
two minutes later , another call came in about an 80 - year - old man who had fallen and was bleeding from his arm			1
@entity11 , despite not being authorized to decide which call should take priority , told the other @entity10 and the driver to go to the aid of the elderly man , according to @entity110			1
' they should have never listened to him			0
protocol is to go to the first call unless the other one is of a more critical nature , ' the captain told the @entity96			0
' they listened to [ @entity11 ] and trusted his judgment because he worked for a paid service			0
' @entity110 said @entity11 believed another driver was on his way , but was mistaken			0
after being unable to find another driver , he went himself			0
underage : @entity11 drove one of these ambulances but is n't permitted to do so until he 's 21 ' he delayed transport on a patient , ' he said			2
@entity110 said that despite his error of judgement , that incident alone would n't have gotten @entity11 suspended			2
however , @entity11 had a record of ' violating our policies and not following our rules			0
... had this been the first incident , he would have been told not to do it again			0
' @entity110 said squad rules about under - 21s driving ambulances are standard and that @entity11 does not have the proper training to operate one			1
the @entity13 first aid and @entity18 addressed the furor over @entity11 's suspension on its @entity145 page			2
' your posts are welcome on this site , but any derogatory posts will be deleted , ' reads a post on the page			0
' the 20 year [ old ] should be praised ! he took a risk to help a 4 year old child			0
this would not have been an issue had the squad had better prepared for a call ... this only shows lack of preparation for this individual unit			0
very glad this is n't the department i would depend on if my child or family was in a medical emergency , ' reads a response			0
many other comments follow along these lines , including many from @entity11 's mother , @entity173 , who alleges @entity110 has disliked her son since he began volunteering with the squad .			2

a 20 - year - old @entity10 was suspended for driving an ambulance to take a four - year - old having a seizure to hospital
@entity11 was alone at an @entity183 first aid *facility* when the call came in
he could n't find another ambulance *nearby* and all drivers in his squad were out
he is not allowed to drive the ambulance until he is 21 but made the decision to take the child to hospital
he was suspended for 60 days for breaking the rules and immediately resigned
the local community is angry at @entity11 's *treatment*
squad board members say it is not the first time @entity11 has broken rules
