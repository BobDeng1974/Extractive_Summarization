so it is perhaps not surprising that the young @entity6 was n’t a big fan of family values campaigner @entity8			1
now , at the age of 64 , the actress has finally admitted mrs @entity8 was right all along			1
despite once regarding her as a busybody intent on ruining everyone ’s fun , she now feels @entity16 ’s self - appointed moral guardian did the right thing by pushing for a tv watershed			1
miss @entity6 , who has an adult daughter called @entity35 , said playing the late campaigner in a 2008 film called @entity38 : the @entity39 had made her understand the importance of the watershed			1

she said : ‘ @entity8 was at her height in about 1972			2

’ in recent months , media campaign groups have warned of a ‘ slippery slope ’ , with increasingly adult themes featuring in pre-watershed programmes			0
in particular , series such as @entity86 and @entity16 ’s @entity87 have been criticised for screening raunchy early - evening performances by singers such as @entity90 and @entity91			2
