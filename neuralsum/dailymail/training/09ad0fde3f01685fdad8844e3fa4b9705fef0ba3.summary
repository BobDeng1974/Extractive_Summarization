measures said she was ' surprised ' to see mr @entity22 and his girlfriend coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past			1
' i do n’t know why i did n’t see them , ' she said			0
' i had to make a decision of what to do			0
i felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file			0
' if i had been concerned , i would have stopped suddenly			0
' mr @entity22 had earlier told the jury he saw measures make a ' stupid manoeuvre ' in front of them on a bend in the @entity79			1

however , miss @entity14 came at her at ' right angles ' after losing control of her bike			1
in a heated exchange at @entity119 , measures was challenged by prosecutor @entity120 , who said : ' you are relying on other road users avoiding you when you are on their side of the road ? ' measures replied : ' i ca n’t help it if a cyclist , with all due respect , falls over as i ’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel			2
' i would expect cyclists to generally remain upright as the first cyclist did and went past			0
' when i looked , it was sufficiently clear not to stop me doing that manoeuvre			0
' you do not make a manoeuvre if you do n’t think it is safe to do so			0
' had everyone stayed upright , there would not have been an issue			0
' i had my daughter in the car			0
