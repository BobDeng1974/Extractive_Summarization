@entity1 deputy leader @entity0 told councillor @entity2 she was ' far too pretty to be interested in politics ' and should join a girl band instead			1
miss @entity0 allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to mrs @entity2 for the first time			1
it comes after the @entity1 shadow minister was accused of ' patronising ' women after unveiling a bright pink women - only mini bus to attract female voters ahead of the election in may			1
she said : ' what women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner			2
not a patronising pink bus screaming drama queen ! ' mrs @entity2 later added : ' when i first met @entity0 she said i was far too pretty to be interested in politics & should be in @entity34			1
' she told @entity35 : ' it was at a conference in @entity37			0
i wanted a photo with her and she said " you 're far too pretty to be in politics "			0
i suppose i 've proved her wrong - i did go on to be a councillor			1
' but miss @entity0 this afternoon rejected the allegation			1
she said : ' i deny i ever said that and it ’s inconceivable i would have ever said that			0
' i have always believed it ’s what you do in politics , not what you look like			0
i have never discouraged a woman from getting involved in politics on the basis of their looks			0
' the allegation sparked fresh accusations that mrs @entity0 was belittling female voters			1
@entity1 's ' woman - to - woman ' campaign tour got off to a rocky start in @entity60 yesterday when an angry voter told her it was ' patronising and wrong ' to divide men and women			1
@entity65 shopper @entity64 demanded to know if @entity1 was planning to also have a blue man to appeal to male voters mrs @entity2 said @entity1 's pink battle van – which has been dubbed the @entity0 's @entity70 bus – exposed @entity72 ' failure to listen seriously to voters ' concerns in a bizarre twist in gender politics , ms @entity0 revealed the party had even held ' doctrinal discussions ' about whether a man is allowed to drive the @entity82 bus as it tours marginal seats			1
yesterday it had a woman driver			0
the minibus , funded by the @entity89 union , will tour 70 marginal seats in the run - up to the election on may 7 , with female @entity93 , councillors and trade unionists on board			0
@entity1 said it will visit school gates , shopping centres and high streets			2
miss @entity0 's tour received a mixed response yesterday			1
@entity101 from @entity60 , said : ' i think it 's silly and i think it 's patronising			0
' her sister , @entity105 , added : ' them using a pink bus would n't make me vote			2
' @entity108 from @entity109 said it is ' very patronising ' , adding that she does not think the pink bus will make any difference to female voting numbers			1
but other shoppers disagreed , with @entity114 , from @entity115 , saying the colour of the bus ' does n't matter '			2
@entity1 's deputy leader @entity0 yesterday unveiled the pink , 16 - seat minibus in @entity60 ahead of its tour 70 marginal seats in the run - up to the election ms @entity0 posed in front of the van with @entity72 including ( left to right ) @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 however , miss @entity0 has spent the day denying it is patronising because it ' does n't have big eyelashes on the front '			1
she told @entity134 : ' it 's not about a colour it 's about something , it 's about our democracy			0
it 's a small bus but big issues			0
' the @entity1 bus has sparked a storm of criticism , and has been repeatedly likened to a @entity70 vehicle ahead of the bus 's official unveiling , miss @entity0 said that ' ultimately ' the colour choice was hers it had to be ' eye - catching ' because there is a ' big hole in our democratic politics at the moment '			1
she insisted that the bus would help to address political disengagement amongst women			0
but critics said the pink obsession makes it look like something from an advert for women - only insurance firm @entity162 's wheels ms @entity0 chatted with shoppers in the @entity60 branch of @entity65 , but many felt the van was patronising @entity169 parody account mocked up @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity130 in a @entity173 's wheels ad this mocked up photo refers to the child abuse scandal in @entity1 - run @entity177 where young girls were repeatedly groomed the use of a pink van sparked comparisons to when @entity1 frontbencher @entity183 was accused of sneering after she tweeted a picture of a white van outside a house with @entity189 flags hanging from the women			1
last week shadow education spokesman @entity191 got into hot water after appearing to criticise nuns as teachers after a difficult week of criticism from business leaders who used to back @entity1 , @entity195 might be glad to have the support of @entity70 senior labour mps tried to defend the colour , insisting it was actually ' magenta ' and had been used at party conferences in the past			2
a @entity1 source joked : ' we modelled it on the colour that @entity208 's face goes when he gets cross during prime minister 's question time			2
' but the prime minister mocked the bus in the @entity212 yesterday : ' what @entity214 's families need to get on most of all is the security of a good school place , and we are providing them , the security of a good job , and we are providing them , and the security of a safe community , and we are providing them			0
' i have to say @entity1 's campaign - i would say the wheels are falling off the wagon but i think the wheels are falling off the bus			2
' we now know it is not going to be driven by anyone on the front bench , surprise , surprise it is going to be driven by @entity89			0
' @entity1 's deputy leader @entity0 defended the party 's women - only pink minibus , insisting it would be ' looking great ms @entity0 was challenged on @entity237 's @entity236 about why everyone was talking about the colour of the bus and not important election issues given that @entity1 's official colour has long been red , it would have made sense – and caused less controversy – if the mini-bus had been red too			1
but @entity0 worried it might have ended up looking like a sandwich delivery firm. , she told journalists : ' we could have had red but that would look like all the other @entity1 vehicles and we wanted something different			1
' then we wanted a darker red but it looked like @entity254			0
we wanted it to look conspicuous and therefore obviously a white van was not going to do the job			0
' it is a very nice looking bus			0
it is the correct colour			0
this is a @entity1 colour			2
' speaking on @entity237 's @entity236 , miss @entity0 said : ' we just wanted an eye catching colour			1
the reason why it has to be eye - catching is because there is a big hole in our democratic politics at the moment			0
' she claimed 9.1million women did not vote in the general election in 2010 ' because they just do n't think that politicians have got any interest in their lives or understand their lives or have got anything to offer to them '			0
she added : ' in this general election we think it 's important that women do think that they have got a chance to have a say and this election is about their future and their daughters and their granddaughters ' future			0
' @entity289 deputy prime minister @entity288 said it was the wrong way to attract female voters			1
he told the @entity292 : ' the @entity70 bus ? it 's just a tiny bit condescending because it 's bright and pink therefore women relate to it more			2
' it 's a bit like saying that political parties should drive around in macho red sports cars and blokes across the country will suddenly listen to them			0
' it just a slightly patronising way to deal with voters it seems to me			2
' @entity312 @entity311 : ' the wheels have come off the @entity1 bus			2
getting @entity0 to drive around the country in a pink van to try and attract the female vote is as patronising as it gets			1
' this is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through			0
the launch of @entity1 's @entity322 bus left internet bloggers tickled pink – as the web buzzed with a host of jokes and parodies			1
one mocked - up an image of deputy leader @entity0 , along with @entity72 @entity128 and @entity130 , in a spoof advert for women 's car insurer @entity332			1
the pink theme was also likened to the 2001 film @entity334 in a mock film poster declaring : ' @entity336 this summer			0
' but one less humorous posting referred to the child grooming scandal which has hit @entity1 - run @entity339			2
it showed the back of the bus emblazoned with miss @entity0 's face and the large slogan ' @entity1 looking after women '			1
attached to an asterisk underneath , the caption adds : ' like we did in @entity177			0
' critics also say the pink obsession makes it look like something from an advert for women - only insurance firm @entity162 's wheels @entity169 parody account mocked up @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity130 in a @entity173 's wheels ad this mocked up photo refers to the child abuse scandal in @entity1 - run @entity177 where young girls were repeatedly groomed the use of a pink van sparked comparisons to when @entity1 frontbencher @entity183 was accused of sneering after she tweeted a picture of a white van outside a house with @entity189 flags hanging from the women			1
