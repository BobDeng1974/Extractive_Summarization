by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 22 october 2012 updated : 10:26 est , 22 october 2012 living in squalor and sentenced to a life of shame and hard labour , these are the women who have been forced to live as outcasts amid accusations that they are witches			1
cut off from their communities and abandoned by their families , they are banished to spend the rest of their days in ' witch camps '			0
hundreds of women in northern @entity14 are accused of witchcraft and condemned to a life of extreme violence , harassment and isolation			1
tribal justice : residents of the @entity23 camp for alleged witches at a community meeting heavy lifting : most of the residents of the camp are elderly and find manual work difficult			0
here , a resident helps her neighbour to lower a bucket of water brought from the communal tap many of the women in the camps have been accused of being witches by relatives or neighbours			1
once an accusation is made they are banished from their villages and sometimes chased out by a violent mob			0
often young female relatives are sent with them to live in the camp as an ‘ attendant ’ and also live in the same appalling conditions , facing terrible discrimination			0
in some cases , the fate of the women is determined not by the elders of their village , but by the dying contortions of a slaughtered chicken			1
if the chicken falls with its head down and its feet in the air , the woman is declared a witch			0
if it falls feet down , her innocence is declared			0
however , regardless of the outcome , once an accusation has been made a woman will be sent to the camp whether she 's ' guilty ' or not , just in case some villagers do not believe her innocence			0
a report compiled by international aid charity @entity70 documents cases of both elderly and young women abandoned by their families and trapped in the ‘ witch camps ’ until they die			2
hard life : the day begins at dawn for residents of the @entity23 camp for alleged witches , when they gather around a communal tap to draw water barren : a resident stands outside the sparse huts of the @entity86 camp for alleged witches the report , titled ‘ condemned without trial : women and witchcraft in @entity14 ’ , describes six ‘ witch ’ camps ’ in @entity14 , @entity23 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity86			1
some camps came in to existence as long as 100 years ago and mostly consist of mud huts			0
women in the camps have to walk many miles to collect water , food is in short supply health and education services are very limited			2
@entity70 says the camps are effectively women ’s prisons where the inmates have been given no trial , have no right of appeal , but have received a life sentence			1
the report highlights the violence suffered by women accused of witchcraft			1
' these women are at the mercy of their accusers who destroy their lives and condemn them to a life of imprisonment ' a mother of three was murdered after being blamed for the death of a child through witchcraft			1
she was beaten unconscious before being set on fire			0
@entity131 , 27 , describes how she came to live in one of the camps			0
she was accused of being a witch by her ex-husband , who beat and poured melted plastic over her while she was pregnant			2
her new husband and family were unable to protect her and took her to a camp so she could hide there			0
she has not been able to leave			0
@entity140 , 66 , has lived in a camp for more than 30 years after she was accused of killing her cousin			2
she said : ' people do n’t care about the alleged witches			0
once you are here you are forgotten			0
' @entity146 , @entity147 , said : ' women accused of being witches find their lives have been snatched away from them			1
the violence and brutality many face is shocking			2
these women are at the mercy of their accusers who destroy their lives and condemn them to a life of imprisonment			1
' pounding dawa dawa : meal preparation is time consuming , and food - related tasks occupy much of the day hard labour : @entity163 , 80 , clears the fireplace in the morning at the camp for alleged witches superstitious : a young witch hunter is dressed in war attire and goes on his search for witches walking through alleys , dancing wildly standing on roofs hiding behind bushes and interviewing residents almost every woman accused of being a witch is poor and powerless			2
an @entity70 survey of the camps found more than 70 per cent of women were accused of being witches after their husbands died			1
the survey also found one in three women in the camp was not earning money before they were accused of being a witch and were seen as an economic burden by their community			1
however , the camps do provide sanctuary for women accused of being witches , as many in their communities believe the women can not practice witchcraft once they are in a camp			1
@entity70 calls on the government of @entity14 to ensure the basic human rights of women in the camps are upheld with access to health and education services			1
action aid also believes the international community and @entity209 government must do all they can to address issues relating to the ‘ witch ’ camps ’ and engage with the @entity214 government to ensure women ’s human rights are protected .			2
