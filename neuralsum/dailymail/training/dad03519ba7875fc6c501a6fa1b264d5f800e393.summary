by @entity1 reporter published : 20:00 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 8 november 2012 chair of the @entity4 , @entity2 is ' astonished ' at @entity6 's deficit the @entity10 's first privately run @entity9 hospital generated a deficit more than twice as high than planned , it emerged today			1
circle , the company in charge of @entity14 in @entity15 , had projected that the @entity14 would be in a £ 1.9 million deficit after six months under its stewardship , but in september it reported a deficit of £ 4.1 million			1
the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) said that while the private provider has made improvements in clinical areas a number of financial challenges remain			1
circle began it 's 10 - year management franchise at the struggling @entity27 - based hospital in february in what is seen as a potential model for other hospitals across the country			0
but the @entity18 said that before any more @entity9 hospitals are run by private providers , the @entity32 must do a ' lessons learned ' exercise to make sure there are no weaknesses in the procurement process			1
@entity40 , director of health value for money studies at the @entity18 said : ' there are potential other franchises , currently @entity44 in @entity45 is under review by the @entity32 as to how their management arrangements are going and this is one potential option			1
' but we believe that before any other franchises are entered into , the @entity32 should do a lessons learned exercise to make sure that any weaknesses in the process are ironed out for any future tenders			1
' in a report about the franchising of @entity57 , the @entity18 said that during the procurement process , the @entity58 assessed the reasonableness of the bidders ' savings proposals but it did not fully consider the relative risks of the saving proposals			1
' this is a first for the @entity9 - the @entity9 has n't done this before - so to an extent they were covering new ground , ' said mr @entity40			0
' moving forward , if they are to have to do this again they need to assess the risk of the bids in a more defined way			0
' both bidders , @entity6 and @entity76 , were asked to come up with a whole range of saving schemes to deliver a minimum of £ 228 million of savings over a 10 - year period which they duly did			1
' while the schemes were evaluated for : ' does this look a sensible scheme ? and is it clinically safe ? etc ' they were n't evaluated to a financial level so they did n't check whether the level of savings that were going to materialise from those proposals were actually going to happen			0
' circle plans to achieve £ 311 million in savings over the 10 - year contract			1
that is an unprecedented level of savings , ' mr @entity40 continued			0
' that 's more than 5 % a year which probably has not been done in the @entity9 to date			0
' in the past decade , the hospital has not made an annual surplus of more the £ 600,000 , he added			2
@entity104 in @entity15 was taken over by @entity6 in february if @entity6 does not deliver a surplus , they get no franchise fee			0
but the first £ 2 million of any in - year surplus is retained by the private provider and any surplus above £ 2 million is split - some to pay off the @entity14 's historic deficit of £ 38 million and the rest to @entity6			1
@entity2 , chair of the @entity4 , said she was ' astonished ' that @entity6 takes profit ahead of addressing the hospital 's deficit			2
she said : ' the purpose of franchising @entity57 hospital to a private company was to turn around the financial fortunes of a failing @entity120 , yet after just eight months under @entity6 's stewardship , the @entity14 has drifted a further £ 4.1 million into the red			2
' @entity6 struck a 10 - year deal under which it can earn £ 31 million if it can deliver unprecedented annual savings of more than 5 %			2
' while there have been welcome clinical improvements since @entity6 took over , it is essential that pressure to make savings does not simply lead to cuts in services in the future			2
safety and quality of care must always come first			0
' before handing @entity6 the contract , the @entity136 failed to test properly whether the required savings are even achievable			0
' there is no clear and common view as to what would constitute a successful outcome or how that would be measured			0
' above all , i am astonished that the contract allows @entity6 to pocket any profit ahead of addressing the @entity14 's deficit			2
worse still , @entity6 suffers no penalty if at the end of the 10 years the deficit is not paid off in full			0
' getting this deal right has huge implications for this hospital 's sustainability and for the 160,000 members of the public it serves			0
' @entity156 , head of the @entity18 , added : ' while @entity6 has made early improvements in some clinical areas , the company will have to generate savings at an unprecedented level			1
' the final judgment on the value for money of the franchise will depend on how successfully @entity6 makes the projected savings and repays the cumulative deficit , while maintaining clinical quality			0
' this franchise agreement is the first of its kind in the @entity9 and it is important that lessons from this procurement process and early operational experience are used to improve future contracts			1

the firm had *originally* predicted a £ *1.9million* deficit
@entity18 says lessons must be learned for future privatisation plans
