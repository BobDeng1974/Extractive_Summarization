by @entity0 published : 21:20 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 3 july 2012 @entity1 lingered in the water after the other swimmers had climbed out of the pool			1
her long career was finally over			1
she wanted to soak up the moment as long as possible			1
the 45 - year - old @entity1 came up short in her bid to make it to the @entity9 for a sixth time			1
she finished fourth in the final of the 50 - meter freestyle monday night , her only event at the @entity15 swimming trials			1
sinking in : @entity1 lingered in the water after the other swimmers had climbed out of the pool after the 50 - meter freestyle qualifier race when she came in fourth place humbling : the 45 - year - old mom waved to fans after she realized she would not make it to her sixth @entity9 ' this is really over			1
that 's it , i 'm going to enjoy some time with my daughter , have a nice summer and cheer on the @entity15 team , ’ @entity1 said			1
after winning three silver medals at the @entity30 , @entity1 underwent radical knee surgery and put all her hopes into a chaotic dash from one end of the pool to the other			2
those hopes were slashed when @entity38 won in 24.50 seconds , while @entity39 took the other @entity9 spot in 24.73			1
' obviously i was hoping to make the team , ' @entity1 said			1
' that was my goal and missing it by less than a tenth of a second is tough , but i do n't think there 's anything i could have changed			1
' @entity1 was denied a trip to @entity49 by nine - hundredths of a second , also touching behind third - place @entity52 ( 24.78 )			2
reading the score : @entity1 knew it was over when she saw her time ( 24.82 ) and noted it came in fourth congratulatory : @entity1 ( left ) praised her competitors @entity39 ( top ) who came in second and winner @entity38 ( bottom ) who will both be going to the @entity49 games @entity1 smiled when she saw her time ( 24.82 ) and hugged both @entity63 and @entity39			1
when @entity1 finally got out , she began motioning for her daughter , 6 - year - old @entity64 , to join her			2
@entity1 walked into the stands , still dripping wet , and scooped up @entity64 , who was wearing a green shirt that said ' go @entity67			2
' ' she 's bummed she 's not going to @entity49 now			2
i told her i 'd still take her , ’ @entity1 said of her daughter			2
in the last event of the eight - day trials , @entity70 won the grueling 1,500 freestyle in 14 minutes , 52.19 seconds			2
@entity74 was right with him all the way , taking the second spot for @entity49 in 14:52.51			2
@entity1 said she had the same nervous anticipation before her last race as she did at her first @entity15 trials in 1984 , when she earned a spot in the @entity82 games			2
she had no illusions about being a serious medal contender in @entity49 , but she wanted to end her career with one more trip to the @entity9			1
' being 45 , getting fourth in @entity9 trials against girls almost half my age , it 's ok , ' @entity1 said			1
support : @entity1 walked into the stands , still dripping wet , and scooped up her six - year - old daughter @entity64 , who was wearing a green shirt that said ' @entity96 ' ' i 'm used to winning , but that was n't the goal here			0
the goal was to try to make it			1
i did n't quite do it , but i 'm really happy with how i did			0
i was able to hang in there			0
’ @entity1 remembered her late coach , @entity103 , who died in 2011 from a rare blood disorder that was diagnosed just before she swam in @entity105			0
' i was very emotional before my swim , ' @entity1 said			0
end of an era : @entity1 has competed in five olympics and won 12 medals during her expansive career ' when i was putting my suit on with my trainer , @entity113 , we started crying because i started thinking about @entity103			0
in july of 2010 , he had said to me , “ @entity115 for this			0
” i really wanted to finish the story that i started with him			0
i did n't make it but i know he would have been proud			1
' @entity63 said it was an honor to compete against @entity1 , who retired twice but came back to win five medals at the @entity123 , then three more silvers in @entity105			0
this time , she 's retiring for good			1
' i love racing @entity1 , ' the 25 - year - old @entity63 said			0
' i wish she could have made it this year , but swimming with her the past couple years has been really an awesome treat for sure			0
' @entity63 failed to qualify for the @entity9 in her best event , the 100 breaststroke , but she bounced back to win the 100 and 50 freestyle , capping her comeback from a failed doping test that kept her off the team four years ago			1
an arbitration panel ruled that @entity63 was the victim of a tainted supplement			0
' doing so well , winning two races here , i could n't have predicted this in a million years , ' @entity63 said			0
' i 'm so happy and so grateful that this meet went as it did			0
' @entity39 did n't even get out of the preliminaries of the 100 free , but she came back in the 50 free to make her third @entity9 team			1
' i did n't start out the meet very well , ' @entity39 said			0
' i did my best to visualize and prepare my body			0
it was my one chance to lay it all the line for this 50			0
i ca n't believe i did it			0

bid to make @entity9 for sixth time *...* and missed out by tenth of a second
