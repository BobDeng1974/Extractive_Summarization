@entity0 have confirmed former @entity2 and @entity3 manager @entity1 as their new manager			1
@entity1 - who led @entity3 to their first @entity8 title in 35 years - edged out former @entity6 defender @entity5 in the recruitment process			1
although van @entity11 was installed as the bookmakers ' clear favourite on thursday evening , it 's believed @entity1 had already been chosen as @entity16 's successor following discussions earlier in the day			1
former @entity3 manager @entity1 has been installed as @entity0 's new manager the 44 - year - old will be at @entity6 on saturday today to watch his new team play @entity23 bottom club @entity22 , with @entity24 remaining in caretaker charge			1
@entity1 , a former @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity2 defender , arrived in @entity0 on friday night as the club announced they had agreed a deal in principle that would see @entity31 backer @entity30 assume control in lieu of a planned fans ' takeover			1
the announcement of that deal allowed the club to appoint @entity1 , who has been working as a scout for @entity38 after parting company with @entity3 in june			2
@entity1 took over as @entity2 boss after playing 134 times for the club and has since led @entity42 though one of their most successful periods the club want @entity24 to stay on as assistant , a role he performed for almost four years under @entity16 , but no announcement has been made on the caretaker 's future			1
@entity1 told the club 's official website : ' i am delighted and find myself in a privileged position			0
i 've done some research into the history of the club and i know how well the football club has done , certainly over recent years			0
' it will be a hard task to take over from @entity16 but one i 'm very excited to take up			0
' i 'm a positive guy and i 'm upbeat most of the time			0
the players will find that and i 'll try and get that across to them			0
i want this club to feel energised and start climbing the table as soon as possible			0
' @entity1 's exit from @entity42 came as a surprise after he led them to their most successful period , which saw them win the @entity70 and cross-border @entity71 as well as the title in his first season in 2012			2
@entity1 had previously had a six - month spell in charge at @entity2 , losing his job in the midst of a relegation battle in the @entity79			0
he had twice helped the club win promotion to the second tier of @entity84 football as assistant to @entity86			0
it is understood @entity1 , who has also worked as a scout for @entity89 , impressed @entity0 with his focus on fitness and discipline and emphasis on playing a passing game , as well as his contacts in the @entity84 game and his track record of helping develop young players			2
former @entity99 manager van der @entity11 also hugely impressed the board with his analysis of @entity0 's recent displays and his vision for the club , but with the club facing a battle to get out of relegation danger , @entity1 was seen as the right man for the moment .			1
