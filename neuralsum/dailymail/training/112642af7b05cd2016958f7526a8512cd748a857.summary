by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 29 april 2013 the results of the report into the care @entity4 will not be published because it could ' distress ' him a council has refused to reveal a review 's findings into the care of a teenager who left a ten - year - old girl for dead - because it would cause the attacker ' further distress '			1
@entity16 has been accused of a ' cover up ' because of its decision , which reviewed the care of @entity4 , who lured the schoolgirl away from friends before beating her repeatedly , throttling her and leaving her on a river bank			1
she was left covered in blood and beaten so badly part of her head had to be shaved and she needed stitches across her scalp			0
a review was carried out by @entity16 after people on the close - knit estate demanded to know why such a dangerous youth had been allowed to live in council care in their midst			2
however the anticipated publication of the report has been refused because officials are concerned about the effect it might have on the teenager			2
@entity4 , who was 16 - years - old at the time of the attack , was jailed indefinitely last july after he admitted causing the girl grievous bodily harm with intent			1
@entity48 @entity47 was told he throttled her and beat her around the head so viciously he could have killed her			0
the brutal assault caused such outrage that police were forced to appeal for calm in the days following the incident			0
the court heard @entity4 , who was in foster care , had a history of petty crime and had shown worrying sexual behaviour as a result of abuse he himself had suffered as a child			1
he could give no explanation for why he attacked the youngster in april last year			0
the council has been criticised by @entity68 , conservative mp for @entity69 , who said their involvement in @entity4 's care should be released			2
the horrific head injuries sustained by the schoolgirl after she was brutally attacked by teenager @entity4 , who lured her away from her friends and viciously attacked her he said : ' given that if there are any details which rightly should be kept private and confidential they could be redacted as is allowed under the @entity80 legislation			1
' i can see no justification why this information is not released and it is clearly a matter of public interest			0
' many people will see this as an attempt to cover - up what may be a failure to implement any real changes following an extremely serious and worrying case			1
' the girl , now 11 , has left the estate with her family to start a new life in a different country			0
her father said : ' he almost killed my daughter			0
why was he allowed to be on our estate ? ' he should not have been able to run the streets			0
' the report should be made public so everyone knows the sort of person he is			2
' the council explained its decision by saying : ' given the passage of time and the fact that the criminal proceedings are concluded any disclosure of personal data arising from the councils audit is in my view unwarranted			1
' the girl 's mother said : ' that thug should never have been allowed to live on an estate full of young families			0
' in refusing to release the internal report , @entity126 , a reviewing officer for @entity16 , wrote : ' the review of procedures centred on an audit of social care intervention in respect of a living individual			1
' this was not the part of the criminal investigation and as far as i can ascertain was not discussed in open court			0
' given the passage of time and the fact that the criminal proceedings are concluded any disclosure of personal data arising from the councils audit is in my view unwarranted			1
' disclosure would not cause any embarrassment for the council but it is likely to cause further harm and distress to @entity4			1
' the council did release the changes it has implemented since the review , which include :			2

report could ' distress ' @entity4 , who was jailed for attack
@entity161 says refusal to release report could be seen as a cover - up
he admitted beating and throttling schoolgirl , before leaving her for dead
@entity169 said disclosure of personal details for living individual is unwarranted
