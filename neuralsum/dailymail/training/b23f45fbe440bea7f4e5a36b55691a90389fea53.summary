published : 19:35 est , 29 september 2012 updated : 19:36 est , 29 september 2012 landscape gardener @entity0 had one last wish as the debilitating physical condition that had plagued him for years entered its final , terrible stages			1
he wanted to die in his garden among the flowers and plants he had tended for decades , surrounded by his family			0
@entity0 , 65 , had been left a shell of his former independent , physically active self by motor neurone disease – an incurable illness that wreaks havoc on the nervous system and causes muscles to waste away			1
overwhelmed by the disease ’s relentless onslaught , @entity0 did indeed try to take his own life at his home			1
but the attempt was unsuccessful and – unable to seek help from his wife @entity21 or anyone else because of @entity24 ’s laws on assisted suicide – he took the agonising decision to end his life at the @entity29 clinic in @entity30			1
end of the journey : @entity0 with his family			1
@entity0 travelled to @entity30 to end his suffering now , for the first time , @entity21 has decided to speak of her husband ’s death in june in the hope it will reignite the debate over the ‘ barbaric and archaic ’ laws that robbed him of his dignity			1
@entity21 , 58 , says : ‘ @entity42 desperately wanted to die a peaceful death surrounded by his family in his garden , which was where he was happiest			0
had he been able to have his wish , the last years of his life would have been so much more pleasurable , knowing he could have a dignified death			2
‘ instead , @entity42 spent every single day worrying about how he could end his life when the time was right for him			1
he never wanted to die in a foreign country but because of the laws in @entity24 , he ultimately had no choice			0
’ it is not the only tragedy that @entity21 has suffered in recent years			2
in february 2011 , her youngest daughter @entity51 committed suicide after struggling with depression			1
the 31 - year - old shop assistant , who suffered from rosacea – a chronic skin condition that caused her face to redden – jumped off the @entity58			1
at the time , @entity0 ’s condition was worsening by the day – and he was particularly badly affected by @entity51 ’s death			1
@entity21 said : ‘ @entity0 had the natural devastation of his daughter dying			1
but it was more difficult for him because of what he was going through			0
‘ after @entity51 ’s death , he was conscious that he did n’t want anybody to think what she had done was influencing him			0
‘ his mind to take his own life was made up from day one			1
’ tragic : @entity68 ( right ) has suffered two tragedies in recent years			2
in february 2011 , her youngest daughter , @entity51 , ( pictured left ) committed suicide after struggling with depression @entity0 had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2008 , three years before @entity51 died			1
@entity21 , who still lives in the home they shared in @entity77 , near @entity78 , said : ‘ the doctor at @entity80 diagnosed him and one of @entity42 ’s first questions was , “ how long have i got ? ” ‘ the doctor said about two years			0
from the day he was diagnosed he said , “ i will not see this through , i will take my own life			2
” it was soul - destroying for him			0
he was robbed of his livelihood and independence			0
’ @entity21 says their daughters @entity91 , now 38 , @entity90 , now 34 , and @entity51 were ‘ shocked and devastated ’ by the diagnosis			0
@entity0 ’s health continued to deteriorate and by december 2011 he was confined to a wheelchair – and it was at this point that he made his failed suicide attempt , while @entity21 was out shopping			1
she preferred not to discuss the details but said that @entity0 had thoroughly researched it and was ‘ convinced ’ that it would work			1
as well as a note to his wife and family , @entity0 wrote a letter to the coroner			1
in it , he said : ‘ if an animal was left to die under these conditions a prosecution by the @entity112 or similar would follow – are animals more important ? ’ agonising decision : @entity0 decided to end his life at the @entity29 clinic in @entity30 ( one building pictured ) @entity21 recalled : ‘ he did n’t want him or any of us to suffer any longer			1
he did n’t want us to go through the misery of watching him die			0
after his failed suicide attempt we had a soul - searching conversation and he came to the conclusion that the only way forward was @entity30			1
’ @entity0 contacted @entity29 in february			1
‘ he was given the green light in may and , from that moment on , it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders , ’ @entity21 says			0
the couple – together with @entity91 and @entity90 – flew from @entity130 to @entity30 on june 24			2
@entity0 was booked into the clinic four days later			1
@entity21 revealed that @entity0 died outdoors surrounded by nature			2
she said : ‘ in the end , we decided the girls should come with us to the entrance to the clinic but only i should go in			2
‘ first of all he took something to settle his stomach and then we sat chatting			0
we spoke about silly things like flowers			0
about an hour later he took a potion and had a glass of water to swill it down			0
i held his hands and we kissed and said we loved one another			0
‘ he got to die in the garden , not his own , but he was outside as he wanted to be			0
i ’m still incensed he could n’t die at home , in his garden as he wanted			0
the laws in this country are archaic and barbaric			0
’ nearly 200 people from @entity24 have ended their lives at @entity29 since it was set up in 1998			2
but critics of assisted suicide argue that it is a violation of medical ethics			0
a spokesman for anti-euthanasia campaign group @entity160 said : ‘ the message assisted suicide sends is that if you are terminally ill , disabled or less healthy , your life is less worthy than if you are young , fit and healthy			2
‘ the moment you start deciding whose life is worth saving and whose is not , you are on a slippery slope			2
’ earlier this month , new health minister @entity168 said she backed changing the law on assisted suicide – under which offenders risk a sentence of up to 14 years – only to face calls for her resignation			0
the @entity175 said : ‘ we have a neutral stance on whether there should be a change in the law			0
