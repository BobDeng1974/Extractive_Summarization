by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 18 may 2013 the misery of sticking - out ears is not just a schoolyard problem – the taunts and teasing can last a lifetime , and both children and adults with prominent ears often feel unhappy and self - conscious			0
but a pioneering new procedure can put an end to the torment , using an implant inserted under local anaesthetic that corrects the ears ’ prominence in just 15 minutes			1
such remarkable results are usually achieved only through invasive ear surgery – known as conventional otoplasty – in which the cartilage is cut			1
this procedure lasts 90 minutes and is undertaken under general anaesthetic			1
fifty - four @entity24 patients have now been treated with the @entity26 implant , which gives instant results and dispenses with the need for heavy bandaging			1
patients can return to work the next day			0
before and after : @entity31 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , pictured left 15 years ago with his daughter when his ears still protruded , and right after successfully undergoing the new procedure one of the first to have benefited from the procedure is @entity31 , 53 , a senior valuer for auction house @entity38 in @entity32			1
‘ i inherited my sticking - out ears from my father and was called bat ears by the boys at school , ’ he recalls			0
‘ i have felt self - conscious about them all my adult life			0
‘ strangely i ’ve minded more as i ’ve got older , maybe because you notice it more as you get balder			0
but i never considered surgery until i heard about the implant			1
‘ my daughter has the same ears as me , and had traditional otoplasty surgery on the @entity54 at the age of ten			1
it was quite traumatic and she still suffers from increased sensitivity around her ears , four years on			0
but this sounded incredibly simple so it appealed			0
’ it was the risks associated with otoplasty that drove plastic surgeon @entity64 to develop the implant			1
‘ i ’ve been performing standard ear correction surgery for more than 15 years , ’ he says			1
‘ it is very time - consuming and carries the same serious risk associated with all general anaesthetic			2
i felt there must be a safer , simpler method			0
’ the new @entity26 implant is a curved strip of flexible metal that is placed under the skin on the front of the ear			1
it works by gripping the cartilage and folding it back into a predetermined shape , pulling the ear closer to the head			2
about ten per cent of the population – six million people – have protruding ears , defined as sticking out by more than 2cm			0
but only one to two per cent of people are unhappy with their ears			0
quick and easy : the new pioneering treatment , shown above , can be completed in just 15 minutes ‘ protruding ears are an aesthetic issue so very much in the eye of the beholder , ’ says mr @entity64			2
‘ but up to a million people dislike their ears and improving their appearance can be life - changing			0
the problem really affects self - confidence – i hope that those put off by conventional surgery might consider the implant			1
’ another major advantage is that patients can specify how they want their ears to look and know what results to expect			2
mr @entity64 says : ‘ before the operation they tell me what they want and i take a sizer – a curved piece of metal the exact size and shape of the implant – and put it on the ear over the skin			1
i move the sizer around until the ear looks the way the patient desires , then mark its position on the skin			2
’ once this is agreed , a local anaesthetic is injected and a small cut ( 5 - 10mm long ) made on the front of the ear , just inside the outer rim			1
the implant , which is just 15mm long and no thicker than a human hair , is then slid into the incision			2
‘ the implant is made from nitinol – the same alloy used in dental braces – which is super-elastic but always returns to its preprogrammed shape , ’ says mr @entity64			2
‘ that means the ear can still move naturally but will revert to the corrected position			2
’ the cut is then closed with two absorbable stitches , which drop out naturally a couple of weeks later			0
about 60 per cent of people need two implants – one at the top and one halfway down – which are placed at the same time			2
although pain and swelling can last up to two weeks , no follow - up treatment is required			0
@entity31 says : ‘ it was a little sore for a few days afterwards but that was it			1
’ for the first few weeks , patients are advised to avoid contact sports and take sensible precautions to avoid their ears being hit			0
earrings should also be avoided			0
‘ if someone is not pleased , we can adjust the implant under local anaesthetic , ’ says mr @entity64			1
the @entity26 is plated with 24 - carat gold to reduce its visibility under the skin and can be left in place indefinitely			0
however , research suggests that after a year , the ear may retain its new shape even if the implant is removed			1
the procedure is currently only available at the @entity168 in @entity169 for private patients .			0

pioneering new procedure uses an implant inserted under local anaesthetic
the implants are inserted in front of each ear to correct their prominence
similar results were *previously* only achieved through invasive ear surgery
@entity31 , 53 , is one of the first to have benefited from the procedure
