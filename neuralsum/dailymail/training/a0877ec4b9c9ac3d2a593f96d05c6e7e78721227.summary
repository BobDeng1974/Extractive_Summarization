what do your favourite drinks look like , up close ? to answer that question , @entity4 company @entity3 has revealed its latest ‘ alcohol art ’ images that reveal the psychedelic nature of drinks and cocktails , ranging from pina coladas to champagne			1
using a microscope , the firm looked under the surface of popular beverages to unearth the unique colours , patterns and shapes that various drinks are made of			1
this microscopic picture of @entity22 was taken in the chemistry department of @entity24 in @entity4 , @entity25 by local firm @entity3			1
these colorful pictures of alcoholic drinks reveal the incredible molecules that make up our favourite drinks the striking images are the result of magnifying liquids up to 1,000 times under a powerful laboratory microscope at @entity24			1
police officers may soon have a powerful new tool in their campaign against drink drivers			0
a laser - based device has been developed that detects alcohol vapour inside a moving car , and it could track down reckless drivers who are over the limit			1
the system works by detecting tiny changes in the laser beam as it passes through vapour - and is capable of detecting alcohol at concentrations as low as 0.1 per cent			0
each of the images is on offer as works of art for prospective buyers who want to examine what goes on inside various cocktails			2
the incredible shapes and colours of the artwork are then highlighted by shining natural light on top , and through , the bottom of the slide			2
the images are then taken using a 35 - millimetre camera			0
in the images , the various crystalised carbohydrates that have become sugars and glucose are visible			0
each picture is taken by using just a pipette of each particular drink , and placing it on a slide			0
this is then placed under a microscope , once the droplets have dried out , and a picture is taken			2
the process is not quick , however ; it can take four weeks for the alcohol to dry out completely in an airtight container			1
this microscopic picture of @entity87 beer shows the remarkable structure of the drink			0
each drink is referred to like a snowflake because , when magnified up to 1,000 times under an advanced laboratory microscope , none are ever the same a microscopic picture of vodka tonic taken in the chemistry department of @entity24 in @entity4 , @entity25			1
produced by @entity100 firm @entity99 , the images are on offer as art works in some cases the entire process of drying can take up to three months			1
and some alcohols are more difficult to shoot than others – vodka , for instance , does not have as many impurities as a pina colada cocktail			2
this means vodka does not always dry out properly , and it can take hundreds of attempts to get the right shot			2
cocktails with fruit and soft drinks , however , have an abundance of citric acids and complex sugars that dry well and make them easier to photograph			0
' @entity3 are photographs of alcohol under a microscope , ' the company writes on their website			1
' these high - quality photographs of your favorite beers , wines , cocktails , liquors and mixers were taken after they were crytallised on a slide and shot under a polarised light microscope			0
' as the light refracts through the beverage crystals , the resulting photos feature naturally magnificent colors and composition			0
' this image takes a microscopic look at champagne			0
to take the images it was necessary for the alcohol to be dried before it was put on a slide and placed under a microscope			1
some types of alcohol , like cocktails , dry quickly and are easy to photograph			2
others though , like vodka , are much more difficult as they have a lack of impurities @entity159 , shown here , is much darker than other drinks , due to the high levels of fructose in the tequila from the agave plant			0
its colour may also be influenced by the high levels of essential oils , also from the agave plant			0
the amazing images show how different liquids can appear under the microscope when just a few key ingredients are changed here a dirty martini is seen under the microscope			1
the technique for making these photos dates back to the early 1990s			0
that was when a research scientist at @entity24 called @entity180 used the method to get additional funding for his laboratory			1

a company based in @entity4 , @entity25 has revealed the latest images of their amazing ' alcohol art '
called @entity3 , the company uses the chemistry laboratory at @entity24 to take the images
alcohol of various sorts , ranging from vodka to tequila , is dried in a process that can take months
the dried alcohol is then placed under a microscope that *zooms* in on the dry liquid up to 1,000 times
this produces the incredible *kaleidoscope* of colours that show how different alcohols are at a microscopic level
