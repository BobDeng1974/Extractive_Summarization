there 's no waiting room , chair to lie down on or high - pitched drill to be seen , but here in the lush woodlands of an @entity15 village , a capuchin monkey seems to fancy himself as a dentist as he peers down deep into the jaws of a friendly dog			1
one can only speculate that the mutt perhaps had a problem with his canines and the primate practitioner was more than happy to oblige			1
just looking at your canines : the inquisitive @entity28 monkey checks out the pooch 's pearly whites photographer @entity31 captured the unusual scene at the coastal resort of @entity34 , which is famed for its large population of the diminutive capuchins			1
coming across the pair , the 53 - year - old said he was stunned to see just how close the dog and monkey appeared to be			1
he said : ' the local dogs , this one in particular , obviously knew the monkeys very well			0
these two seemed to be best of friends , allowing lots of liberties between them			0
' in these pictures the monkey seemed to be grooming the dog , both were very comfortable with each other and really seemed to enjoy the interaction			2
' they were never aggressive towards each other and would even play fight			0
' i was enthralled by the interaction having never seen anything like it before			0
' people i have shown the images to have difficulty believing that these are indeed free roaming wild monkeys , but everyone finds the images entertaining			2
' mr @entity31 , who lives in @entity15 with his wife @entity66 , added : ' i had visited this town because i had heard about these wild monkeys			1
' i went down the beach and found the monkeys enjoying it as much as the people			0
it was pretty incredible to see			2
' some of them had ' borrowed ' a football and were playing with it			0
' others were catching fish in the river under the rocks and some , like this one were interacting with the local dogs			0
' monkey massage : the primate practitioner feels around the dog 's jawline during his check now open wide : the diminutive dentist takes one last look before the check - up is complete			2
