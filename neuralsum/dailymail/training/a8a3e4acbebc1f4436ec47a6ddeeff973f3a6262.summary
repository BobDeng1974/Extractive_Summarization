by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 are finding it tougher to acquire suitable full - backs because of the £ 30million fee @entity5 paid @entity6 for @entity7 , according to head coach @entity8			1
a first - choice right - back is desperately needed , while a second left - back would also appeal but prices have been inflated since @entity7 's move to @entity13			1
left to think : @entity8 has claimed full - back prices have become inflated following @entity7 's move to @entity5 from @entity6 in the summer record breakers : @entity7 moved to @entity5 from @entity6 for £ 30million baggies target : @entity8 has confirmed an interest in @entity20 defender @entity19 @entity21 seem keen to keep @entity1 target @entity22 , who will travel with the squad on the @entity26 tour , while a loan move for @entity20 's @entity19 is an option			1
@entity29 and @entity30 - signed for a combined £ 1m - are the club 's only senior full - backs			1
@entity8 said : ' when you start looking for full - backs now the price has changed as a result of what happened with @entity7			1
everybody is suddenly worth an awful lot more than they were before			0
' that makes it more difficult for us			0
we have a budget we have to try and work within			0
clearly every pound we can save on one position we can use on another position			0
' we are looking for full - backs			2
@entity19 is perhaps an option			0
but nothing has been agreed			0
he 's a @entity20 player and one they rate			2
' @entity1 also want two strikers - to supplement @entity53 and @entity54 - and a wide player .			2
