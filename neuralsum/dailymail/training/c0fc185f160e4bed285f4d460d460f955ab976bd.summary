digital cameras have revolutionised photography , making photography cheap , easier and readily available to all			0
however , one photographer has shunned modern equipment to use a 160 - year - old method that requires a portable dark room and an enormous camera that captures just one image every 15 minutes			1
the collodion process - otherwise known as the wet plate process - was wildly popular from the 1850s to the 1880s			1
invented by @entity15 , it was known for giving fine detail but also for being highly impractical			0
echoes of history : a street scene in modern @entity21 city centre near the @entity23 area taken by @entity24 using the collodion process - an archaic photographic method clash : the historic buildings of the north - east city jar with the modern cars because of the archaic photographic method @entity24 , 41 , from @entity21 , has been practicing the process for three years and says the results are highly satisfying			1
' it 's definitely far more rewarding than digital photography because of the time and attention needed for each picture , ' he said			0
mr @entity24 will only take two to six photographs per day when using the wet plate process and reckons there are only around 50 people doing it in the @entity44			1
while this style of photography may be completely baffling to most who simply press a button on their phone for instant snaps , mr @entity24 takes a lot of joy from it			1
he said : ' the fun part of it for myself is the need to be near a darkroom to process each shot			0
' it 's similar to a polaroid , once it 's been shot you can move onto the next shot without thinking about the time you have to spend in @entity66			0
' ' in theory it 's actually quicker because many working photographers will spend hours on @entity66 , however you do end up with less images			0

@entity74 , a busy stree in @entity21 city centre clash of cultures : a @entity80 re-enactor in front of modern cars , captured using a 160 - year - old photographic method			1
right , cars sit incongruously in the street scene the process starts in the darkroom by pouring collodion onto one side of glass and then dipping it into silver nitrate , which makes it sensitive to light			2
while still under dark room conditions , the plate is then loaded into a camera and taken to @entity24 's desired location			1
@entity24 will then take his lens cap off the camera to expose the plate to light and guess how long the cap needs to be off for to obtain correct exposure			1
the plate is then taken back to a dark room and developed in a similar way to conventional film negatives			0
unlike negatives and digital photos , the finished plate can be sealed with varnish to stop the silver oxidising and achieves a permanent record , as proven by stills taken 150 years ago			0
mr @entity24 admits that he 's often quizzed by curious members of the public about using such an unusual camera , including famous comedian @entity118			2
a portrait of a couple in @entity21 city centre			2
while this style of photography may be completely baffling to most who simply press a button on their phone for instant snaps , mr @entity24 takes a lot of joy from it the full - time photographer explains : ' i use a wooden 10x8 @entity135 camera from the 1880s so i get questions all the time , especially in @entity21 city centre			1
' i 'm always with another person whilst shooting , that way one of us can concentrate on the process whilst the other answers the inquisitive public			0
' @entity118 was dumbfounded when i took the camera to book launch			0
he could n't stop laughing and was expecting some flash powder ! ' it 's also a great way for making contacts as i 've got a few photography jobs from a result of hanging around @entity21 with a big wooden box			2
' mr @entity24 , who is a self - employed photographer but does wet plate in his spare time , believes that the famous city is perfect for his art. ' the process suits subjects with lots of detail in such as the old ornate @entity163 doorways , ' he said			2
' there is plenty of scope but the only thing that stops you is the parking and those bus - only lanes			0
' i 'm planning on replacing the car with a mule and perhaps a cart at some future stage - though the wife may need some convincing			0
' photo historian : photographer @entity24 , 41 , with his 130 - year - old camera in @entity21 the plate from the camera is taken to a dark room and developed in a similar way to conventional film negatives			1

@entity24 , 41 , uses the collodion process , which was a photographic method used from the 1850s to the 1880s
he has to haul around a huge @entity135 camera from the 1880s to take his *incredible* images of @entity21
each still takes 15 minutes to capture but he says the fascinating results are worth the effort required
