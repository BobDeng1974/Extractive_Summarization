by @entity0 the makers of @entity3 graham crackers have come up with a unique response to anti-gay backlash by some against its commercial featuring two gay dads and their family			1
they printed out the negative comments and turned them into a piece of art that spells out ‘ @entity14			1
’ on march 10 , @entity15 , which manufactures the popular crackers under the @entity18 brand , launched its ‘ this is @entity20 ’ advertising campaign			1
the commercial features several different kinds of @entity24 families , including biracial and gay ones			1
the commercial , which has more than 4.7 million hits on @entity28 , starts off with the two dads huddled over their baby feeding a bottle			2
it then cuts to the two men walking			0
following , that it features other families doing everyday things while enjoying @entity3 crackers			2
a tagline accompanying the @entity28 video reads , ‘ no matter how things change , what makes us wholesome never will			2
’ since the ad ran , the comments @entity15 has received have been overwhelmingly positive			1
‘ beautiful commercial , ’ one commenter wrote			0
‘ a family is a family no matter what			0
this is what the world is , people will just have to accept that and open their minds to it			0
it 's a wonderful thing			0
﻿ ’ however , the company did receive a fair share of negative comments			1
‘ nothing like exploiting the gay community for some advertising and $ , ’ another person wrote			0
‘ keep your advertising where it belongs			0
’ in confronting the backlash , @entity15 on thursday ended up releasing another video , where the negative comments are used in a creative way			1
the commercial shows some of the negative comments the company received			1
it then shows two female artist rolling up tightly copies of the comments and then gluing them together			0
@entity15 's creative response to the backlash was to spell out the word ' @entity14 ' in script using rolled up pieces of paper with the negative comments the ' @entity14 ' paper sculpture of negative comments is greatly outnumbered by the scrolls of paper with positive feedback to the @entity3 commercial featuring two dads the camera pans away , showing the the rolled up pieces of paper have been placed on the floor to spell out the word ‘ @entity14 ’ in script			1
but @entity15 did n’t stop there			2
the commercial goes on to say that the company received ten times as many comments in support of the original spot than negative ones			1
it then shows , in slow - motion , the scrolls of paper with the positive comments surrounding the ‘ @entity14 ’ paper sculpture to demonstrate the overwhelmingly positive response			1
at the end of the video , a tagline reads , ‘ proving that only one thing matters when it comes to family			0
’ it then cuts to the ' @entity14 ' paper sculpture			1
‘ awesome reply to trolls ! , ’ one person commented			0
' i do n't even eat graham crackers , but i think i might buy a box this weekend			0
﻿ ’ ‘ i do n't have enough thumbs to like this , ’ wrote another			0
‘ i want 100 more			0
’ @entity15 is n’t the only food company to use non-traditional families in commercials			2
last year , cereal maker @entity145 received backlash after airing a @entity148 commercial featuring a biracial family			1
however , the positive feedback was so overwhelming that @entity145 used the family again in a commercial it made for the @entity152 earlier this year			2
@entity3 graham crackers have been around since 1925 when the @entity154 introduced them			0

as part of its ' this is @entity20 ' campaign , @entity15 launched 30 - second commercial featuring different families , including gay and *interracial* ones
although the company received negative responses from some *consumers* , positive comments **outweighed** them more than *10-fold*
@entity15 released a new commercial *addressing* *thebacklash* by having two artists create a paper sculpture spelling out ' @entity14 ' with rolled up *printouts* of the negative comments
the video response also showed that the number of positive responses far **outweighed** the negative ones
