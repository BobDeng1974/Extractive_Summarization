@entity0 claims he has been placed in an ' uncomfortable situation ' by @entity4 chief @entity3 ' dithering			1
@entity0 should have known by now whether he had a future with the team beyond this season as @entity3 promised over two months ago to deliver an answer on his driver line - up ahead of this weekend 's year - ending @entity10			1
@entity0 and team - mate @entity11 , however , were informed this week they would be kept in limbo until december 1 at the earliest as to who will partner @entity15 in 2015			1
@entity0 is pictured in the @entity17 paddock ahead of the final race of the campaign the @entity20 could be competing in his final race with @entity15 set to replace him next season via a statement , seemingly in @entity3 ' words , the team claimed ' the optimal driver line - up is clearly an important process , and it is therefore one that requires precise and prolonged analysis '			1
just how long it requires @entity3 to decide between the experience of a world champion and a driver at the end of his first year , but who he rates very highly , has been a hot topic on social media			1
certainly there was the feeling @entity0 , in particular , given his longevity and standing in the sport , has been treated shabbily			1
there is also a train of thought that as @entity0 apparently has other options , @entity3 is delaying matters to force him into opting for the exit door , so leaving the @entity48 ceo with an easy choice			1
@entity15 shares a joke with @entity0 in thursday 's press conference after the @entity52 was asked who he wanted to team up with at @entity4 next year			1
@entity15 ( left ) announced he was officially leaving @entity54 on thursday after five years with the @entity56 team assessing the latest twist in the saga over his future , @entity0 said : ' it 's been an interesting few months			1
' when you 're in @entity62 for so many years - 15 years - you have blinkers on in terms of anything else apart from @entity62			0
' this is the best sport in the world , this is your life , this is everything			0
but when you are put in an uncomfortable situation your eyes are opened to other possibilities			0
' there are a lot of challenges out there , whether it 's in motorsport , another sport or something else altogether			2
' i 'm open to many things in life , and for me i love what i do for a living , i love racing in @entity62			0
' the time i have spent with @entity4 , ok the last two years have been a bit tricky because of the results , but in terms of the personnel , they 're mega			2
' we had a barbecue on wednesday night , and there is such a good atmosphere in this team			0
it is like a big family , and i have loved working with them			0
' but will i wait for the decision ? that 's something i ca n't comment on right now			0
' ahead of the race at the @entity105 , @entity0 is hoping the outcome will play no part in @entity3 ' thinking			2
' personally , i would hope not , ' added @entity0			2
' i would hope a result would not change my fate for the future			0
