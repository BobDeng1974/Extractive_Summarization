the mp for @entity10 triggered a storm of outrage when she jetted off to the jungle for a month when she should have been in @entity14			1
instead of taking part in @entity16 debates and helping her constituents she has been seen eating as ostrich anus and performing a woeful stand - up routine with @entity19 from @entity20			0

’ miss @entity3 did not make clear whether her mother had explained she wanted to take part in a reality tv show on the other side of the world			0
but mr @entity31 is adamant that no conversation was had about being away from @entity48 for a month , and certainly not to be a contestant on the @entity34 show fronted by @entity51 and dec. ‘ conversations between the chief whip and colleagues are confidential , ’ a spokesman for mr @entity31 said			1
‘ but in this case @entity56 is happy to confirm that permission to go to @entity59 for one month to take part in i ’m a celebrity was neither sought nor was it given			2
’ as mps prepared to return to @entity14 , ms @entity3 was performing a poorly - received comedy routine with @entity19 from @entity20 there is widespread speculation in @entity14 that when ms @entity3 returns from the jungle she will reject the idea of a meeting with mr @entity31 ’s successor , sir @entity72 , and instead choose to sit as an independent mp on the opposition benches			1
mr @entity31 was forced to resign after a month of headlines about his foul - mouthed rant at @entity77 police officers who told him to get off his bike			1

instead she has been voted to take part in a @entity90 which involved eating various animal body parts including a camel 's toe and an ostrich 's anus			0
and her performance in a task telling jokes was deemed so dire she missed out on the chance to go to the jungle pub. one of ms @entity3 's other daughters , @entity101 , admitted she has repeatedly voted for her mother to take part in stomach - churning challenges in the jungle			0
she told @entity33 she could not help but laugh at her mother 's efforts on the notorious bushtucker trials , revealing : ‘ i have voted for my mum for both of the trials - it 's much more interesting to see her do it			2

@entity32 told @entity34 her mum was cleared by party bosses to take a month off from the commons
but former chief whip @entity31 says she never asked for permission to jet off to the jungle
