by @entity0 jailed : @entity1 stole £ 15,000 from two couples who were desperate for children before claiming she had miscarriages a couple have spoken of their agony after conwoman surrogate @entity1 took advantage of their longing for a baby to scam them out of thousands			1
@entity15 and @entity16 were one of two couples taken in by @entity1 , who faked a doctor 's letter after telling them she was pregnant with their child			1
mr and mrs @entity16 told of their ordeal after @entity1 was jailed for three years and four months for three counts of fraud yesterday			1
@entity28 had heard how @entity1 contacted the couple after hearing of their difficulty having a second child in 2012			1
she convinced them to pay her £ 1,000 to be inseminated and another £ 4,000 after showing them a doctor 's letter			2
mr and mrs @entity16 told @entity36 that @entity1 even sent them a photo of herself holding a positive pregnancy test as she bombarded them with demands for extra cash			1
mrs @entity16 , 46 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , told the paper : ' she would phone us up at all hours asking for money			2
' she was playing us in the most cold and calculated way			0
we 're emotionally scarred for life			0
she 's a she - devil			1
' the couple initially agreed to keep paying @entity1 , saying they desperately wanted to believe she was carrying their baby			1
but after they handed over £ 5,000 to the fraudster , she broke off contact and they heard nothing from her			0
they later contacted the doctor 's surgery on @entity1 's letter - who told them the document was a fake - and then went to the police			1
mrs @entity16 said : ' we thought she was carrying our child and she knew how desperate we were			2
she destroyed that dream in the cruellest possible way			1
' @entity1 also lied to @entity71 and @entity72 , who had been trying for a child for 12 years , taking more than £ 10,000 from them before claiming she had been involved in a serious car accident and had lost the baby			1
in 2010 @entity1 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , also alleged she was pregnant with the grandchild of @entity80 , following an arrangement with his son @entity82 - and again claimed she miscarried - which police also believe may have been a scam			1
detectives fear the two couples who helped bring the case to court may not be her only victims			1
judge @entity92 yesterday jailed @entity1 , who sobbed in the dock of @entity28 , for her ' brutal and heartless ' actions			1
criminal : @entity1 , pictured with one of two babies she has given up , was sentenced at @entity28 to more than three years in jail the judge said : ' in about 2010 , you achieved notoriety when agreeing to act as a surrogate mother for the son of @entity80			1
' be those facts as they may , what this case is about is how you agreed firstly to be a surrogate mother for @entity109 and mrs @entity110 , a childless couple who had been trying unsuccessfully for many years to have a child			1
' it is no doubt because they were desperate and as a consequence of your skills as a fraudster that you quickly earned their trust then proceeded to practise one breathtaking deception after another and persuaded them to believe that you were going to provide them with what they desperately wanted			2
cruel : @entity1 , 28 , from @entity77 , admitted defrauding childless couples by telling them she was pregnant and then saying she had miscarried ' it was no more than a tissue of lies that you told as you continued to take sums of money from them			1
for you , that was all that this was about			0
after they had parted with over £ 10,000 in your deception , they contacted the police			2
' by that time , you had found further victims			2
mr and mrs @entity16 , desperate for a child to be a brother or sister for their son			0
they too were completely taken into your web of deception , parting with money , being fobbed off with one lie after another until they ended up heartbroken and deprived of over £ 5,000			0
' judge @entity92 said @entity1 's actions were ' deliberate , sustained , callous acts ' that had left both families devastated			1
' this is not a case about financial loss , it is a case of two desperate couples being completely taken in by you and your lies , ' he said			2
' of course they lost money but they have lost a great deal more than that , they have ended up heartbroken			0
' in 2010 , @entity1 appeared in national newspapers following her arrangement to carry a child for @entity82 , the son of @entity80 , and his wife			1
she had already completed two successful surrogacies but miscarried the @entity80 pregnancy , the court heard			1
describing @entity1 's other victims , prosecutor @entity180 said @entity71 and @entity72 contacted @entity1 , who was registered as a potential surrogate mother , online in 2011			1
on january 26 2012 , @entity109 and mrs @entity110 met @entity1 and agreed to pay her £ 20,000 to carry their child			2
' there followed an agonising and fairly lengthy series of events designed to milk the couple , taking advantage of their desperate wish to have a child and preying on their good nature and their emotional ties to the event itself , ' ms @entity180 said			0
@entity1 insisted she would carry out the artificial insemination herself as she did not want to undergo the procedure at a clinic			2
' she did say that it was her ambition to be the most prolific surrogate mother in the country , ' ms @entity180 added			0
@entity1 said she was carrying twins for @entity206 , pictured with her , left , and her then husband , @entity80 's son , @entity82 , but lost them after she was reportedly attacked while walking in a street in @entity210 on february 22 , the @entity211 travelled to @entity1 's home in @entity28 and she disappeared into a bedroom to carry out the artificial insemination before being paid £ 1,000			1
she announced she was pregnant on march 10 and the @entity215 paid a further £ 2,600			0
but weeks later , on march 31 , @entity1 claimed she had suffered a miscarriage			1
mr and mrs @entity110 continued to support her financially , paying £ 750 for rent and £ 250 for car maintenance			0
' they were already so emotionally and financially attached to this arrangement that they were easily manipulated , ' ms @entity180 said			0
according to @entity227 law , the woman who gives birth to a child is always regarded as the legal mother at the moment of birth			0
her husband , if she has one , is regarded as the legal father , but if the surrogate mother is unmarried , the genetic father can be named on the birth certificate			0
a parental order can then be applied for through the courts , which confers full parental status and responsibilities on both the intended parents			0
the order is only made if at least one of the intended parents is biologically related to the child , the intended parents are in a long - term relationship and the surrogate mother and her husband agree to it			0
a surrogate mother can not be paid for her pregnancy , although the law allows her to be given ' reasonable expenses ' , which can reach around £ 10,000 - £ 15,000			0
intended parents do not have the same rights of maternity and paternity leave as those who have children naturally , although many companies now have ' adoption leave ' procedures which sometimes include rules for leave related for surrogacy			0
in may , she pretended to artificially inseminate herself at their home and announced she was pregnant on may 27 , extracting a further £ 2,700			0
' all of this was a sham , ' ms @entity180 said			0
@entity1 continued with the faked pregnancy , demanding £ 150 for further car maintenance , £ 795 for rent and £ 2,000 for new accommodation in june			2
' as far as they were concerned , she was pregnant with their child and they had to look after her and take care of her , ' ms @entity180 added			0
on july 2 , mrs @entity110 asked to see a photograph of @entity1 's 11 - week scan			1
two days later , @entity1 claimed she had been in a car crash and had lost the baby			1
the @entity215 lost contact with @entity1 , who ignored their requests for refunds , until february 2013 , when she offered them another baby			1
representing @entity1 , @entity287 said his client was ' remorseful ' for her actions			2
' she is clearly an intelligent woman , ' mr @entity287 said			0
' she is somebody who has done something she is thoroughly ashamed of			0
she will have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life			0
' speaking after the case , detective constable @entity294 of @entity295 appealed for other potential victims to come forward			2
' we would like to hear from anyone who feels they have been directly affected by @entity1 , as we are still not sure how many couples have put their faith in her , only to be duped in similar circumstances , ' he said			1
the officer said @entity1 acted as a surrogate to one family , providing them with two children , but the truth of her arrangement with @entity82 was not known			2
' we have had no lines of communication with the @entity314 , ' @entity311 said			0
' without knowing the full circumstances , it is difficult to say but i suspect there may have been a similar situation involving them			0
' he said the two couples involved in the prosecution were still suffering the impact of @entity1 's deception			1
' it has been an emotional rollercoaster for them , ' he said			0
' they are still deeply affected by the situation			0

@entity1 took cash for cars and homes before saying she miscarried
@entity335 wanted proof she was pregnant so she told them babies had died
victims brand her a ' she - devil ' as they speak of their ordeal at her hands
they say she destroyed their dreams of a baby in the ' cruellest possible way '
28 - year - old had claimed she was carrying @entity80 's grandchildren
police fear the two couples at centre of case may not be the only victims
@entity1 admitted fraud and was jailed for three years and four months
