@entity1 , the hardest hit by the @entity3 epidemic ravaging @entity4 , should brace for thousands of new cases in coming weeks , the @entity0 warned today			1
' many thousands of new cases are expected in @entity1 over the coming three weeks , ' the @entity7 health agency said in a statement			1
the death toll from the deadliest @entity3 epidemic the world has ever seen , which is spreading across @entity4 , with @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity13 the worst hit , has topped 2,000 , out of nearly 4,000 people infected			1
key development partners trying to help @entity1 respond to the outbreak ' need to prepare to scale up their current efforts by three - to four-fold , ' it added			1
the countries hardest hit by the epidemic are among the world 's poorest , with dilapidated medical infrastructures that have all but buckled under the strain of trying to contain the virus			0
before the outbreak , @entity1 for instance had one doctor to treat every 100,000 patients in a total population of some 4.4 million people			1
now that 152 healthcare workers in the country have been infected and 79 have died , the @entity0 said the ratio had worsened significantly			1
' every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly , ' it said			2
the @entity7 body described how taxis filled with entire families , including members suspected of having @entity3 , criss - crossed @entity21 ' searching for a treatment bed '			0
as @entity0 staff in @entity1 confirm , no free beds for @entity3 treatment exist anywhere in the country			1
' @entity1 already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths , and ' the number of new cases is increasing exponentially , ' the @entity0 warned when @entity3 patients are turned away from treatment centres , ' they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes , where they inevitably infect others , perpetuating constantly higher flare - ups in the number of cases , ' it said			1
taxis and motorbike taxis have become a prime source for possible @entity3 transmission , since the vehicles are not disinfected between passengers , if ever , according to the @entity0			1
' the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in @entity3 - specific treatment centres , ' it said			2
how @entity4 is being affected by cases of @entity3 , centring on @entity13 and @entity1 fourteen of @entity1 's 15 counties have now reported confirmed cases of the tropical virus , which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids			1

only 240 are currently available in that county , while 260 are being planned , said the @entity0			1

the initial phase of the treatment centre will be up and running within eight weeks , the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) said			2
the centre will comprise a 50 - bed facility for treating victims of the disease , with a 12 - bed unit to provide specialist care for local and international health workers			2

' the scale of the problem requires the entire international community to do more to assist the affected countries , which is why the @entity108 is working with the government of @entity13 to build a new medical treatment facility near their capital @entity117			0
' when it is up and running , it will enable the @entity108 to provide medical care for local and international health workers , as well as treatment for the wider population			2
' @entity136 chief executive @entity165 said : ' @entity3 threatens thousands of people 's lives across @entity4 and could set back development many decades			1
' the key to combating this epidemic is backing front - line health workers and underpinning a fractured health system in @entity13 - without urgent action to assist medics , many more children and their families will suffer and die from this most appalling and tragic disease			2
' @entity136 is working alongside @entity123 and the @entity178 on a feasibility study to cement plans to firstly help set up the centre and then take it over with international experts , as well as local staff , to provide the very best life - saving health service under the most challenging conditions			0

' @entity123 was unable to provide any figures for the cost of the centre until it is established , but it will be in addition to the £ 25 million of aid already committed to the @entity3 crisis			0
