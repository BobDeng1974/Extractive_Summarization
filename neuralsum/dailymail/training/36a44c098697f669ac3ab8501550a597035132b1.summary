by @entity0 first @entity1 spawned a cult ‘ bingo ’ game for soggy bottom lovers			1
now the @entity6 is hoping to replicate the show ’s success with a version for amateur gardeners - and has filled it with even more naughty innuendo than its predecessor			1
starting next week , @entity14 will see nine pairs of green fingered contestants compete for the title of best grower by producing vegetables , fruits and flowers for a panel of experts			1
the @entity6 show will be hosted by @entity25 , left , and judged @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 in the place of @entity1 ’s @entity31 and @entity32 , the new show will be judged by the @entity33 ’s former gardener @entity26 , jam expert @entity27 and floral designer @entity28			1
hosted by @entity25 , it was filmed over six months last year and will follow the same format as the hit cookery show , where contestants are set a different challenge each week and attempt to avoid elimination			1
mr @entity26 supposedly provides much of the show 's risque humour but producers are hoping viewers will also appreciate its irreverent puns , following @entity1 ’s lead			1
bake off spawned an internet craze in which viewers flocked to social networking sites to share the best catchphrases , including ‘ soggy bottom ’ , ‘ raise your game ’ and ‘ it ’s got a good wobble			2
’ many of the vegetable double entendres in the @entity14 are even more risqué			2
in the first episode , viewers will hear mr @entity26 , 69 , discuss the merits of some ‘ good , erect stems ’ , a comment that produces muffled laughter from his fellow judges			1
later in the show , miss @entity27 advises a contestant on the correct pan to use for jam making , saying with a knowing look that it depends on ‘ the thickness of your bottom ’			1
speaking before the show ’s launch , mr @entity26 - who was superintendent of the @entity76 for 25 years - admitted he deliberately inserted naughty puns into the show to liven it up			1
he said : ‘ at the end of the day you ’ve got to enjoy it			0
it ’s got to be fun			2
that ’s my motto in life			2
‘ and i ’ve always been a great believer in just twisting it a little bit , because nobody gets hurt			0
it takes it away from being boring			0
’ the show ’s executive producer @entity94 promised it will get even ruder as the series progresses			2
she said ‘ you ’ll enjoy episode six			0
@entity99 does utter the words “ i ’ve got wood in my mouth ” ’			0
she added : ‘ melons week was excellent			0
’ former @entity107 presenter @entity106 , 56 , said it was a ‘ tradition ’ to slip rude jokes into otherwise innocent tv shows			0
the new show hopes to ride the same wave of enthusiasm that has made the @entity1 , judged by @entity32 , left , and @entity31 , right , such a success she added : ‘ @entity28 ( @entity115 ) was very naughty			1
his eyebrows were shooting up at some stages			0
’ it is mr @entity26 who is set to carve a role for himself as the gardening equivalent of @entity31 on the show			1
he has been tending to flowers and plants since he was a ‘ nipper ’ and in a separate interview with the @entity125 , he opened up about his time as the @entity127 gardener			2
he said : ‘ i was in charge of @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
all the @entity33 @entity135 wanted was flowers , flowers , flowers			1
but when @entity138 took over at @entity134 , large areas were turned into an allotment because he ’s a vegetable nut			2
he used to come and ask advice			0
her majesty took after her mother : more colour than veg			0
’ asked if he was a prickly judge , he replied : ‘ someone said i was a cross between @entity154 and @entity32 ! i am just myself and i try to give lots of advice			0
i hope this is going to inspire people			0
no disrespect to makeover programmes but one minute it looks like a jungle and the next you could be at @entity164			0
gardening is all : “ oh no , the greenfly ’s got the roses , ” or “ @entity169 ’s destroyed the beans ”			2
a lot of that happened and there were tears			0
’ the @entity171 was filmed in a walled garden within the grounds of @entity174 in @entity175 last year			1
it will screen on tuesday , april 15 , on @entity177 at 8pm .			1
