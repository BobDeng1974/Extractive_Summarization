when @entity1 netted the winning penalty to condemn @entity3 to defeat in the 2003 @entity5 final , they surely would not have envisaged it would take them this long to get back to @entity9 's top table			1
that penalty shootout followed a 0 - 0 draw which saw @entity12 crowned @entity14 champions in the first all - @entity16 final			2
now , after a long journey , @entity3 are back among the continent 's elite			2
another goalless draw , this time against @entity21 on wednesday night , was more successful for @entity22 's @entity3 as they reached the @entity5 semi-finals with @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 on the horizon			1
@entity29 was celebrated reaching the @entity5 semi-finals , 12 years after final heartbreak @entity3 ' players salute their supporters after the final whistle in @entity21 having made it to the last four @entity3 have endured a tough few years but they are now back were they belong among the elite of @entity9 the 12 - year gap between now and that night at @entity38 has been one of twists and turns : relegations , promotions , league titles , stripped league titles and @entity14 failure at the hands of relative minnows like @entity48 and @entity49			1
captain @entity29 said on wednesday : ' i thought i 'd have to wait less when i was at this stage 12 years ago , but seeing the journey was very difficult , we can enjoy this result even more			1
' we knew it was a great opportunity and after 12 years we wanted to honour the history of @entity3			1
' even this season , @entity3 supporters thought they were as good as out of this tournament as early as late october			2
a shock defeat by @entity61 in @entity62 had them on the brink of exit before they scrambled to a runner - up spot in @entity66 behind @entity67			0
then @entity68 gave them a mighty scare in the last - 16 before the narrow win over @entity21			2
@entity1 sent @entity29 the wrong way with the winning penalty in the @entity38 final on 2003 the @entity3 players , including @entity76 ( centre ) reflect on their defeat in the showpiece final back in 2010 , @entity3 were downed by @entity48 in the @entity80 , a side now in the championship @entity82 celebrates after leaving @entity3 on the brink of exit back in october , but they made it through looking back , their group - stage progression is not too dissimilar to the club 's fortunes over the last decade			1
after finishing third in @entity89 the season after the 2003 final , @entity3 came back to win the league twice in a row - only to be stripped of them both amid @entity93 's match - fixing scandal that sent them into the second division			1
on promotion , they took four further years to reach the summit of @entity93 's top tier once again but piece - by - piece , the nation 's most successful side has rebuilt			0
that has n't come easy , particularly with their domestic division being overtaken by @entity106 's @entity105 , @entity108 's @entity107 and the @entity110 @entity109			0
talent is hard to tempt to @entity93 - as shown by the failings of @entity12 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
and when the talent does come , it is usually picked off by the big boys from abroad			0
the @entity16 champions were relegated to @entity120 amid @entity93 's matchfixing scandal but soon rose back up @entity3 celebrate their second consecutive @entity89 title last season , and they are on track for a fourth now but not at @entity3			2
the side celebrating on the @entity127 pitch on wednesday night included household names such as @entity29 , @entity129 and @entity130 , while @entity131 - the most sought - after talent in @entity9 - is on his way back from injury			1
he could even be ready for the semi-finals , something any opponent would dread			0
they have n't conceded in their last three @entity5 games - a hallmark of any great @entity16 side - and their comfortable domestic lead gives them all the time in the world to prepare for their final two or three matches in the competition			1
@entity29 and @entity129 hug on the pitch of the @entity127 , and they both have a point to prove @entity130 is one of the most sought - after midfielders in @entity9 but he has stuck with @entity3 until now @entity131 could be back in time for their semi-final next month and will likely be a key player in any clash @entity27 , @entity26 and @entity25 should beware : the oldest team left in it have a point to prove , and for some this could be their last shot at @entity14 glory			1
@entity129 has been linked with a return to @entity162 after nine years in @entity9			2
@entity163 , @entity164 and @entity29 are not far from the end of their careers , either			0
combine that with the midfield prowess of @entity131 and @entity170 , and the solid defence provided by @entity172 and @entity173 and they just might do it			0
@entity3 will be the team that everyone wants to draw but nobody will enjoy playing against			0
@entity177 , @entity163 , @entity129 and @entity178 celebrate reaching @entity9 's final four @entity163 , aged 35 , might be facing his best chance of one last @entity14 title with the @entity3 this season @entity130 had it about right after wednesday 's game when he said : ' i am not afraid of anyone			1
' i think all four teams in the semi-finals have their qualities and on friday we 'll see who we face , but right now i think we 're on a par with all of them			0
we play with our heads now and are a mature team , i 'd say			0
' the @entity14 giants wearing the famous black and white stripes might finally have awoken .			0

@entity3 reached semi-finals of the @entity5 by beating @entity21
they could face @entity25 , @entity27 or @entity26 next month
but the @entity16 giants will not fear anyone and could cause an upset
@entity3 have endured 12 years of struggles since reaching final in 2003
but they now boast stars such as @entity131 and @entity129
@entity29 and @entity130 both say they can go on in competition
