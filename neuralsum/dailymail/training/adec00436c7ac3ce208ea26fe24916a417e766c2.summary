@entity0 is sleepwalking towards a surveillance society because of the proliferation of cctv cameras , an independent watchdog has warned @entity0 is sleepwalking towards a surveillance society because of the proliferation of cctv cameras , an independent watchdog has warned			2
the @entity0 ’s surveillance tsar @entity7 says the nation ’s privacy is being increasingly invaded – but many of the cameras are doing nothing to stop crime or keep the public safe			1
mr @entity7 called for a public debate and greater regulation to ensure cameras ‘ do not proliferate unnecessarily ’			1
he added : ‘ we have millions of cameras in this country and @entity20 look at us askance that our society actually accepts the volume of cameras we do			1
‘ you can still maintain the balance of excellent surveillance but not have a propagation that is actually useless			2
‘ run well , it ’s a useful tool for society			1
but to quote a former information commissioner , “ we should not sleepwalk into a surveillance society ”			0
’ mr @entity7 , who is responsible for overseeing about 100,000 publicly - operated cctv cameras , said it was imperative that local authorities tell the public exactly how many were watching the streets			1
the independent surveillance commissioner is also concerned about the rising use of body - worn video , drones and number - plate recognition systems , or @entity43			0
@entity0 has one of the largest cctv networks in the world			0
on top of the publicly - operated cameras there are another 6million private and domestic surveillance cameras nationwide			2
mr @entity7 said some councils have found they were wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on ineffective cameras			1
one , a @entity54 local authority , reviewed its surveillance and saved £ 250,000 by reducing the number of ineffective cameras			1
meanwhile , @entity57 – which covers more than half of @entity59 – could stop monitoring @entity60 after a review found little evidence the cameras deterred crime or anti-social behaviour			0
it means that , for instance , a shoplifter being tracked by council @entity60 in a public street is lost when they flee into a shopping centre where the system is privately owned			0
mr @entity7 also highlighted cases where the quality or format of footage meant it could not be downloaded or used by the police or courts			2
mr @entity7 , a former senior counter-terrorism officer at the @entity91 , reiterated concerns about the use of drones and body - worn cameras			1
police , housing and environmental health officers , landlords , door supervisors , university security staff and even some supermarket workers are wearing state - of - the - art cameras to capture anti-social behaviour on film			0
he said : ‘ technology can support law enforcement and protect society			0
my concern is about the introduction of poor surveillance that does n’t benefit society			0
’ mr @entity7 , above , called for a public debate and greater regulation to ensure cameras ‘ do not proliferate unnecessarily ’ he warned that spiralling levels of surveillance , especially lightweight cameras worn on uniforms , could harm policing by making the public reluctant to talk to officers if they were confronted with cameras			1
but at the same time , he said , it would be ‘ short - sighted ’ for local authorities to cut @entity60 as part of an austerity drive			2
the @entity127 said town halls consult residents , businesses and police on whether @entity60 is appropriate in an area , and operate in accordance with the code of practice			0
a spokesman added : ‘ councils are not going to spend money on cctv cameras unless they genuinely believe they will work			1
many are actually scaling back @entity60 operations			0

@entity7 claims the nation ’s privacy is being increasingly invaded
said we need regulation to ensure cameras ‘ do *n't* proliferate unnecessarily ’
many councils wasting hundreds of thousands on ineffective cameras
