by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 12:28 est , 1 february 2013 when @entity2 had thousands of pounds worth of equipment stolen from his farmyard , the police took a statement , gave him a crime reference number , and drew up a list of the missing items			1
but when a week later they appeared no nearer to catching the culprit , mr @entity2 decided to take matters into his own hands			1
the farmer and part - time mole catcher logged onto internet auction sites and searched first for a pressure washer similar to the one that had been stolen			1
farmer @entity2 , left , traced thief @entity21 , right , after @entity21 put his stolen goods on @entity23 £ 15,000 haul : when @entity27 police raided @entity21 's home , they found goods from several other burglaries not only did he find someone trying to sell a model identical to his , but when mr @entity2 clicked on the seller 's other photographs , he saw boxes of his stolen gear lined up in the background			1
after duping the seller into agreeing to a viewing , mr @entity2 carried out a secret reconnaissance of his property - then handed over his dossier of information over to police			1
officers acting on mr @entity2 's information raided the home of @entity21 in @entity47 , @entity48 and arrested him and recovered the stolen goods			1
inquiries revealed he had carried out 15 other raids			2
during the raid officers found items worth around £ 15,000 , including two expensive mountain bikes , that had been stolen from more than a dozen @entity27 farms			1
this week @entity21 , 27 , was jailed after admitting burglary at @entity57			1
father - of - two mr @entity2 , who owns a flock of 60 sheep and runs a separate mole catching business in @entity64 , @entity58 said : ' i was delighted to get the stuff back but i was very disappointed in the initial police reaction			1
this image shows the van used by @entity21 to steal goods from @entity2 's @entity58 farm			1
valuable farm equipment : @entity21 was caught after he advertised the goods for sale on the internet ' they go on about rural crime killing business in the countryside and i agree with them , but it seemed they were n't taking this burglary seriously enough			1
' i 'm sure what i did is no different to the old days of victims of burglary going round the second - hand shops to see if their stolen stuff is up for sale			2
but i do wish police would do their bit more too			0
' i 'm sure that if i had not done what i did , i probably would n't have got my stuff back			0
' mr @entity2 discovered around £ 4,000 of machinery and stock had been stolen from one of his outbuildings in an overnight raid last september			1
among the items taken were tools , fencing and containers			0
he initially reported the theft to @entity27 police but lost patience when they had not tracked the thief down , and decided to do some digging for himself			2
within minutes of logging on to @entity23 , he saw his @entity109 pressure washer being sold by a man in @entity47			2
other photographs posted by the vendor showed boxes of farming equipment stolen from mr @entity2 's farm piled up in the background			1
@entity118 detective : @entity2 traced his stolen goods himself after he says the police failed to find the thief @entity21 's lawyer said he was unemployed and in financial difficulties when he stole the farming equipment mr @entity2 said : ' i could n't believe the gall of him when i saw pictures of my stuff for sale			1
' in the pictures , i could even see the rest of my stuff in boxes in the background			0
i said to my wife , eve : " come and look at this , it 's unbelievable ! "			0
' it was amazing that all of my stuff had been stolen and just days later i could see it all brazenly up for sale on the internet			2
i certainly did n't hold out much hope that i would ever see any of the items again but there it all was			0
' ' i rang the police to tell them about my lead and yet no one called me back			0
i was so worried i might lose my lead i sent the seller a message on @entity23 saying i was interested in buying the pressure washer			0
' amazingly he sent me a message back saying it was fine to take a look and gave me his address so i could come and view it			2
' mr @entity2 then staked out the house , noting down vehicle registration numbers of cars coming and going from the property and trying to see if he could spot any of his stolen items			1
another image of the vast array of goods stolen by @entity21 , who is now in jail after admitting burglary he printed out all of the pictures from @entity23 and gave them to @entity172 with his other information			1
he added : ' i told them " that 's all of the evidence , now go out and arrest them "			0
' it was n't particularly difficult what i did ; i was just so frustrated that no - one in the police seemed to be taking the case seriously			0
' ' i was really disappointed in the police but mainly i just wanted to stand up for small businesses			0
i did n't think that they were taking the burglary seriously so i took matters into my own hands			0
' to me £ 4,000 is a lot , and i know that most of the time victims of crime like this do n't get the stolen items back			2
' i 'm pleased he 's been caught : these yobbos need to know that their behaviour is not acceptable			0
' at @entity195 was given a five - month prison sentence plus an additional eight months after inquiries revealed he carried out his raids whilst under a suspended jail term for wounding			0
his lawyer @entity201 said @entity21 had been unemployed and in financial difficulties at the time of the offences			2
