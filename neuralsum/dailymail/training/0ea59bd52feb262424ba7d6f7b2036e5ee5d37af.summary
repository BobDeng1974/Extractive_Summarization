from the elaborate turrets to the hidden room of reflection , it ’s a painstakingly detailed tribute to a medieval castle			0
but it seems @entity6 was so engrossed in recreating the past that he forgot one very modern detail – planning permission			1
now the 55 - year - old @entity11 presenter could be forced to tear down the structure , which he built in the seven - acre grounds of his country mansion near @entity15 in @entity16			1
@entity6 has this wall and raised flowerbed built in the garden of his @entity16 home without planning consent @entity6 bought the house , which is on the site of the 14th century @entity24 , 11 years ago			1
the ruins of the old castle still dominate the grounds , but evidently @entity6 wanted a new one , too			2
so the musician built a two - storey walled structure to surround his swimming pool and his newly planted patriotic garden , laid out in the shape of a @entity34			1
the walls contain a built - in parvis – a type of medieval room designed for quiet reflection			2
despite the size of the imposing construction , he apparently did not realise that he needed to ask for planning permission			0
the musician has now made a retrospective planning application to @entity47 council			1
the later presenter , pictured with his wife @entity49 , has applied to his local @entity50 for retrospective planning permission for the wall the application boasts of the wall ’s ‘ high standard of construction ’ and use of local stone			1
it reads : ‘ the new wall and planters create a cohesive and attractive garden area viewable from the main house and the adjacent swimming pool and annexe			1
‘ care has been taken to maintain the high standard of construction and detailing used elsewhere			0
‘ the wall itself has been constructed to match identically those already around the swimming pool , using natural local stone laid in lime mortar			0
the wall also has ‘ crenellations ’ along the top , which in a real castle would have been used by bowmen to fire arrows down on attackers			0
the application continues : ‘ at the west end of the wall , a set of steps leads up to a small room sitting over a gateway that leads to the northern end of the @entity90 room has no practical use but has been built as a visual feature using historic references			2
‘ as far as we have been able to establish , we think that such a structure is known as a parvis			0
’ a @entity50 spokesman said : ‘ the works that were carried out were undertaken by the owner on the assumption that planning permission was not required			1
he was subsequently advised that this was not correct and submitted a planning application			0
’ so far , no neighbours have objected to his plans			0
mr @entity6 is a well - known figure in the nearby village of @entity108 and used its church for his 2005 wedding to long - term girlfriend @entity112			1
celebrities including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 attended the ceremony			0
aerial view of @entity6 's @entity16 house showing the garden where he has built a medieval - style wall since buying the property , mr @entity6 has added a music room , annexe and entrance hall to the manor house , as well as a large swimming pool			1
a previous survey of the land , made when the swimming pool was built , said : ‘ there was unlikely to be any archaeological remains of any significance in the area			0
’ @entity24 , which now consists only of four rough stone walls and a gatehouse , is on the ‘ @entity141 ’ list of important listed buildings			0
according to @entity143 , it is in a ‘ very bad ’ condition and in need of a-list priority attention			0
@entity6 received an obe in 2004 for services to the @entity150 music industry as a television presenter and musician			1
he is also a deputy lieutenant of @entity16			2
his wife is a member of a landed @entity155 family and was formerly married to the @entity156			2
@entity6 formed his 20 - piece @entity157 after starting his own @entity158			1
he has a weekly show on @entity160 , as well as hosting the television show later ... with @entity6			2
his annual hootenanny has become a staple of @entity165 television			0
last night @entity6 and his planning agent , architect @entity167 , were both unavailable to comment .			2
