' despite this hot dry weather , the plans and measures we put in place meant that our customers did not experience any significant disruptions during this period			0
' water @entity161 , the trade body for the water sector , said the data on complaints was ' great news ' , adding : ' the industry will continue to work hard to provide the very best services and drive down complaints even further			2
