@entity0 , pictured outside court today , has been cleared of racially aggravated assault a cross-dressing art curator accused of punching a manager at the @entity5 and calling her a ' f * * * ing fat , @entity8 b * * * * ' has been cleared of racially aggravated assault			1
@entity0 was alleged to have punched @entity9 when she refused him entry to the trendy central @entity12 nightclub because he was n't a member			1
the 41 - year - old @entity15 art curator denied the charge and was today acquitted at @entity17 after a one day hearing			1
speaking afterwards he said he was ' delighted ' the case had been settled			2
ms @entity9 claimed she was left with a cut nose after being punched by mr @entity0 , who is the director of the @entity21 , on may 9 last year			1

he and some friends had earlier attended a party at the @entity34 nightclub when they tried to enter the restricted bar , the prosecution claimed			2
mr @entity0 denied her allegations , instead claiming he had been told to leave the exclusive nightclub because he was wearing women 's clothes , full make - up and 12inch high heels			1
he admitted slapping the @entity8 manager as an act of ' instinctive ' self - defence but denied racially abusing her beforehand			1
he also accepted possibly causing the cut on her nose with the ' thick ' he was wearing at the time and said he told the woman she had ' terrible hair '			1
passing sentence district judge @entity53 said he could not be sure which party was telling the truth and so found the defendant not guilty			1
' the prosecution called only one witness and what they are saying to me is that i can exclude the possibility that she was n't telling the truth			0
' they are saying that this woman had been working there for 10 years and she would n’t lie , ' he said			0
' i can not do that in this case because i have inconsistent evidence and i think it is significant inconsistent evidence			0
' what probably happened i would not like to say			0
can i be sure it happened the way the @entity75 say it happened ? the answer is no. ' because i can not be sure that you did n't act in self - defence i find you not guilty			0
' speaking after the hearing mr @entity0 said he was relieved to have been acquitted			2
self - defence : the art curator says he was discriminated against because he was wearing women 's clothing ' i ’m delighted , it ’s been a very difficult day for me			1
' this sort of thing has never happened to me before - thank @entity87 it ’s over			0
' i was confident that what i was saying was real and this was reflected but i could n't be sure i would be believed			0
' the @entity5 - named after @entity90 - was founded in the 1980s as an alternative to @entity12 's traditional gentlemen 's clubs			1
it is known for the hell - raising behaviour of members including @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
earlier ms @entity9 wept as she claimed that @entity0 punched her ' two or three times ' on the nose after calling her a ' f * * * * * * @entity8 fat b * * * * ' during the 1am confrontation			1
she said that the curator and his friends were ' quite loud and noisy and not very nice to staff ' , so she asked them to leave but they said they had to get a drink of water first			2
after she again insisted that @entity0 leave , she said , ' he grabbed my hair and there were two or three hits			2
i did n't know what was happening			0
' ms @entity9 added : ' the next thing i remember i was behind the bar with two guys who were cleaning my face and putting a napkin with ice on it			1
' ms @entity124 asked : ' were you able to see how the defendant hit you ? was it open or closed ? ' the witness replied : ' i think it was closed			0
' the court was shown a picture of ms @entity9 's bloody nose and swollen eye following the attack			1
' when i was a kid i lost my eye , so i already have got half of my face looking this way , ' she said			0
' after being attacked i have more scars and look worse than i already did			0
' @entity0 , who appeared in court wearing red lipstick , eyeliner , a leather jacket decorated with hearts and high heels , said he felt ' discriminated ' against because of the way he was dressed			2
venue : the fight took place at the @entity5 in @entity34 , known for members ' hell - raising antics he denied that he had asked where she was from or called her a ' fat b * * * * ' , claiming that he slapped her in self - defence after she hit him when he insulted her hair			1
the defendant told the court : ' i said she had terrible hair since it was covering her face and that it was difficult to speak to her			0
' asked what happened next , he said : ' she slapped me immediately just after i said that sentence , on my left cheek			0
i slapped her back in self - defence			0
it was an instinctive , defensive reaction just to say , " stop please , do n't go further			0
" ' @entity0 accepted that he was responsible for the cut on the bridge of ms @entity9 's nose , but claimed it had probably been caused by a large silver ring he was wearing			1
' it is very thick - i was not targeting anything , i was just responding instinctively and probably the back of the ring touched her nose and because of that she was injured , ' he said			2
the defendant said that he had had one glass of wine and two vodka tonics before the incident and accepted he was not entirely sober , but he denied that he lost his temper or that he had hit ms @entity9 with a closed fist			1
' i have never lost my temper in my life , i am a university professor and i get on well with people , ' he told the court			0
