by @entity0 the hidden loft said to have inspired the ' madwoman in the attic ' of @entity4 is being opened to public tours for the first time			1
@entity7 was reportedly captivated when she saw the room in the stately home of @entity10 , @entity11 , on a visit in 1839			1
the novelist heard how in the 18th century , a ' madwoman ' nicknamed @entity15 was locked in the attic so she would be hidden away from the niceties of life in @entity20 's upper class			2
the link between the two homes was cemented in 2004 when @entity10 ' owners , sir @entity35 and @entity36 , discovered a forgotten stairway in their home which is described vividly in the book			1
now the public will be able to book tours of the attic for the first time after a long - running £ 500,000 conservation project to stop the house from falling into disrepair			1
sir @entity35 and @entity36 , who emptied the house for the overhaul in 2006 , made the announcement as their project won a major award			1
the restoration prize , to be announced tomorrow by the @entity67 and auction house @entity68 , recognises a long struggle by the couple to make the attic accessible to more people			0
enduring : @entity7 's @entity4 focused on the life of the governess of the same name ( pictured ) @entity36 told @entity76 : ' while we 're restoring other parts of the house , we wanted to leave the attic exactly as it is			1
it would n't have the right atmosphere if it was given a new coat of paint			0
' the house itself is extremely ancient - we 've discovered it has @entity87 origins and the timbers including in the attic date to the late medieval period - so we ca n't have hordes of people			0
' although the uneven , wonky staircase will not be suitable for everyone , the couple hope to open the attic rooms to pre-booked small groups from july next year			1
the @entity15 story was unsurprising given the times in which she lived , @entity36 added			2
' if you had a relative that was mad or eccentric it would be a social disgrace , ' she said			0
' if you had someone with symptoms of madness you would hide them as far away from everybody as you could			0
' the house made headlines around the world in 2004 when the owners , who have had @entity10 in their family since 1624 , found a hidden staircase to their attics			1
historic : the oldest parts of the building including its timber frames date back to the late medieval period desolate countryside : @entity123 as @entity4 in a 2011 film adaptation of the classic @entity126 novel many believe the stairway , which leads eventually to the furthest room where the ' madwoman ' was said to have lived , is the same one described as leading to the attic in the fictional @entity132			2
in the classic book , @entity45 lives hidden in the attic as her husband @entity44 courts his home 's young governess , @entity4			2
but on the eve of her wedding , his spurned wife sneaks into @entity4 's room at night and rips her wedding veil in two			0
eventually the secret is discovered and ends in tragedy , when mr @entity44 's first wife burns down the house and takes her own life			0
her ' madness ' has been interpreted by many scholars as a study of how @entity151 of the time unfairly stereotyped foreigners - from @entity153 , in her case - as wild people who had to be tamed .			0
