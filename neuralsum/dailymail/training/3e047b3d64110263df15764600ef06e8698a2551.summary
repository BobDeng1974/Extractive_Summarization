by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 05:22 est , 11 september 2012 romance was the order of the day at @entity3 this afternoon , as the designer sent out a collection of evening gowns in light - as - air silks a complete contrast from the @entity12 collection yesterday , the designer 's mainline collection was pure understated luxury that promises to be as easy to wear as it is on the eye			1
the dresses ranged in hue from soft caramel to rose pink and aquamarine to lavender , as if borrowed from a watercolour artist 's palette			2
one bubble hem number was topped by a co-ordinating ostrich feather shrug , another was an intricate network of embellished cut - outs			2
a showstopper , though was a chiffon evening gown that shimmered with delicate beading			0
supermodel @entity39 was among the girls on the catwalk - it is likely to have been a mad dash for the teenager who also walked @entity46 this morning			2
understated : the eveningwear was pure luxury that promises to be as easy to wear as it is on the eye layers of lavender : though each look was monochrome , mrs @entity3 added drama with texture @entity56 , the face of the label 's campaigns , was in the front row , along with @entity62 actress @entity61			1

lady of the hour : @entity3 takes a bow as her guest applaud at the end of the show 3.1 @entity74 a favourite among @entity76 's coolest girls , 3.1 @entity74 paid tribute to his target customer with a streetwear - inspired collection that was heavy on pale denim and graphic prints			1
the silky shifts and elegant tailoring that the designer has become known for were certainly present , but the latest line had a deconstructed feel with a mash - up of unexpected layers and prints			2
speaking after the show , the designer explained : ' it 's about taking what you have in front of you , cutting it up , not throwing anything away and mixing it up again ... streetwear mash - up : the silky shifts and elegant tailoring that 3.1 @entity74 has become known for were certainly present , but the latest line had a deconstructed feel but i do n't want it to come off as your homeless , so we disguised it and veiled it with sheerness , so there 's an illusion to the sensuality			1
' @entity112 have so far been raving about the collection - particularly the pink suede overalls			1
