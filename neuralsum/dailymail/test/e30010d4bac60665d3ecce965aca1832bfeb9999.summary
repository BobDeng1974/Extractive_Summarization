' it was very straightforward when i was top 10 in the world playing both tours , ' @entity0 told @entity35 ahead of his first @entity37 appearance since 2012			1
' i know i am back in the top 50 but i have only just got back into the top 50			1
it was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision			0
' i still have to play 13 events and right now i am not in the @entity43 or @entity16 or @entity44 champions at the end of the year			2

there is definitely passion and a fire there burning , ' he added			0
' certainly one of them i felt like i was maybe denied , the others i have n't been in a position to make the team and watching @entity74 and @entity75 has been brilliant			0
' what they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and i want to be part of that again and not just part of it , but a real solid team player and leader in the team room , which i know i can be			0
when i play my best golf i think i can certainly play that kind of role			0
' @entity51 captain @entity88 said earlier this week he wanted @entity0 on his team for @entity90 next year , and the 37 - year - old added : ' @entity0 ( @entity92 ) said the same thing ( even though i was a member of the tour at the time )			1
' he was desperate for me to be part of that because i had won twice around @entity75 and unfortunately was n't playing the golf i needed to			0
' @entity1 captain @entity88 ( right ) , speaking with @entity98 in @entity21 , wants @entity0 on his team @entity0 finished sixth on his @entity37 debut in 2004 and is relishing being back at @entity101 after failing to qualify in 2013 and 2014			1
' when you have been here and gone away for a year or two you certainly appreciate it when you come back , ' he added			2
' i 'm very focused this week but i am enjoying being here and lapping up everything about it			0
' i was on the same flight as @entity109 ( who was also ineligible last year ) on sunday and when we landed the girls who run the courtesy car service here had all made little signs saying ' welcome back @entity109 '			2
