@entity0 selects his squad for the autumn internationals on wednesday , a huge moment which will set the tone for next year ’s @entity5			1
it ’s his most important squad selection yet			1
will he announce a squad geared to attack or stay true to his mantra and favour a more conservative approach ? selection is an art , not a science			1
as head coach it is the no 1 skill you require			2
you stand and fall by it			1
selection reflects the coach ’s mindset both to his own team and to the opposition			1
do not underestimate how closely @entity0 ’s opposite numbers will look at this announcement			1
watching @entity28 v @entity26 at the weekend , you see that they ’re so committed to running the ball and making their passes , even from deep			1
i believe attacking , high - speed rugby has its place more than ever			1
i really hope @entity36 go for it this autumn , put an emphasis on attack and produce a team sheet that inspires the nation and asks questions of the opposition			1
are you going to be really excited about your @entity36 team ? can you get 82,000 people on their feet going nuts ? it must be based on playing at a pace as no team can live with that			1
it must be a team geared to scoring tries			1
this is not easy , but you only get one chance to be in the hot seat			2
looking over my time with @entity36 there are selections i ’m really proud of — the tough calls i got right			1
but there ’s others i got wrong , and those ones still wind me up today			2
here are the principles that guided my selections			2
1 can they shine on @entity74 ? test match and @entity5 rugby is way above @entity79 or @entity80 rugby yet when naming squads you are often judging current form at club level			2
this takes real skill , and often it comes down to backing your gut , especially when introducing a player to the international scene if more obvious candidates exist			2
it ’s tempting to pick players from winning teams but this can be too simplistic			2
there can be some absolute gems playing in losing teams			0
@entity101 ’s raw speed and execution in the final third stood out for me and he once started for @entity36 the week after he ’d been dropped to the @entity105 second xv			1
@entity107 ’s @entity106 will be fascinating here			0
@entity36 have spotted something exceptional — will they continue to back @entity106 now he is playing @entity110 rugby ? @entity111 was brilliant against @entity112 at the weekend even though @entity113 lost			1
@entity106 is now playing @entity110 rugby - will @entity36 still back him ? 2 focus on attack you can always work hard to bring your defence up to scratch whereas if you pick strong defensive players first it ’s not so easy to transform them into an attacking threat			1
for years people told me i had the balance wrong in my preferred @entity36 back row — @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			1
they said i was effectively playing three openside flankers			0
but i did n’t care			0
they were our three best ball - in - hand attacking options in the back row and they developed into an awesome defensive unit as well			2
to attack you must pick two real ball players at 10 and 12			2
i would love to see @entity111 play with @entity139 , that would be my choice if @entity36 really want to attack			1
@entity111 could form an exciting partnership with @entity139 if @entity36 decide to attack giving debuts to @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 in my first match in charge against @entity28 @entity153 's debut at full back vs @entity28 in 2001 , after talk that he was not up to the job			1
bringing in @entity156 for @entity157 for the @entity5 semi-final against @entity159 in 2003			0
dropping @entity126 for @entity160 vs @entity28 in 2002			1
3 react to mistakes in elite sport you have few chances to make mistakes			0
i got some selections wrong			0
i wished i ’d played a second fly - half at inside centre in @entity171 in 2002 to take the pressure off @entity173			0
i did n’t and @entity173 could barely breathe that day with @entity174 all over him			0
in the following year ’s @entity176 @entity175 started alongside @entity173 at 12 and in the 2003 @entity5 semi-final @entity156 took @entity157 ’s place			0
4 keep game plan in mind when playing two good kickers at 10 and 12 , as i often did , it made sense to have wings like @entity185 , @entity101 and @entity186 who were great in the air so they could get on the end of crossfield kicks			0
good kicking out of hand is attacking rugby			2
@entity36 have a lot of talent at 10 , but they do n’t have any 12s who can kick			1
if @entity111 and @entity139 played 10 and 12 , you could have a back three of @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
@entity202 ( shown here scoring a try for @entity105 against @entity204 ) could be vital in the back three @entity200 ( left ) and @entity201 can also form part of @entity36 's back three this autumn 5 use world - class @entity207 playing with relentless pace will force the opposition into giving away penalties so you will always need what a world - class goal - kicker provides : touchline conversions , penalties under pressure and drop goals			1
you need back - up in this area			0
could we have won the 2003 @entity5 without @entity173 ? i would like to think so			0
because we had @entity225 in the squad who , while not @entity173 ’s equal in goal - kicking , was certainly next in line			2
@entity139 is a world - class goal - kicker , but who is the 85 per cent kicker if he is injured ? @entity36 do not appear to have a back - up kicking option in the same class as @entity139 @entity0 must make the big calls 6 solid tight forwards your front five must be proven ball winners			1
you must have 100 per cent scrum possession on your ball and a minimum of 85 per cent on your own line - out throw			0
and you must be rock solid at restarts			0
@entity26 showed this at the weekend ; their re-start play is phenomenal			1
forwards who can guarantee you that get priority over others who might possess a more eye - catching all - round game			0
7 the coach must decide the buck stops with the head coach			0
of course you should canvass the opinion of your senior coaches but this has to be your squad , your moment in time			2
it will be the coach ’s head on the line if it goes wrong			0
8 no compromise nothing should stop you fielding the team you want			2
i was very excited to see the wheels in motion for @entity273 to move into the @entity80 and make himself available for @entity36 selection			1
he should be eligible for selection regardless of where he plays			0
i applaud the @entity278 and @entity279 in bringing @entity280 into @entity281 and i ’d love to see @entity283 change codes as well			0
in 2000 i decided to do everything i could to get @entity153 and @entity285			0
one of those punts came off spectacularly			0
9 find your gun xv select your starting @entity289 , your ‘ @entity290 ’ xv and make sure everybody knows it			0
if the overall culture , spirit and ethos is good it will be win - win in terms of generating internal competition			0
those with the shirt will be aware they are the players to be toppled ; the ‘ reserves ’ will be hungry for selection			0
10 warrior test regardless of who and where we were playing , the ‘ warrior test ’ was a key criteria for me when it came to selecting my starting line - up			0
could this player handle facing @entity26 in @entity313 or @entity314 in @entity315 ? they must be able to think correctly under pressure			1
@entity318 : @entity36 will be ready for @entity5			1

@entity0 names squad for autumn internationals on wednesday
@entity36 take on @entity26 , @entity314 , @entity323 and @entity28
@entity0 will stand and fall by his *decisions* this week
he must pick a team geared towards attacking and scoring tries
