@entity2 may already have 20 nuclear warheads - double as many as previously thought , @entity1 nuclear experts have warned			1
the pariah state may also have the capability to produce enough weapons - grade uranium to double its arsenal by next year , @entity4 has reported			1
@entity1 estimates of @entity11 's nuclear production , relayed to @entity13 nuclear specialists , exceed most previous @entity13 forecasts of between 10 to 16 bombs , said the report , which cited people briefed on the matter			1
the pariah state may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads , it has now been suggested @entity2 leader @entity27 addresses @entity29 pilots in an undated photo released by the state news agency earlier this month			1
under the @entity27 dynasty @entity2 has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations experts at the @entity13 - @entity37 at @entity39 's @entity38 earlier this year presented three scenarios for @entity2 's nuclear capability , predicting its stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within five years			1
@entity2 has conducted three nuclear detonations , the most recent in february 2013			0
asked about the report at a regular press briefing yesterday , @entity1 's @entity47 spokesman @entity46 said he ' did not have knowledge of the specific situation '			0
' we must persevere with denuclearisation on the @entity54 , persevere in safeguarding peace and stability , and persevere in resolving the relevant issue through dialogue , ' @entity46 said			0
earlier this month , @entity13 admiral @entity59 , commander of the @entity60 and @entity61 , said the @entity13 military believes @entity2 has the ability to miniaturise a warhead and mount it on a ballistic missile , although there had been no tests			1
one such rocket is an intercontinental missile with could theoretically hit @entity70 as it is designed to carry a payload of more than 5,000 miles			2

the country could have as many as 100 warheads within five years , it has been suggested @entity81 professor @entity80 was allowed to visit @entity11 in 2010 and reported seeing a large uranium - enrichment facility			1
the @entity4 quoted him as saying : ' some eight , nine , or 10 years ago , they had the bomb but not much of a nuclear arsenal			2
' i had hoped they would n't go in this direction , but that 's what happened in the past five years			0
' the more they believe they have a fully functional nuclear arsenal and deterrent , the more difficult it 's going to be to walk them back from that			0
' @entity2 carried out nuclear tests in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 , and has an extremely active ballistic missile development programme , although expert opinion is split on how much progress it has made , reports @entity102			1
the @entity1 estimate reflects growing concern in @entity105 about the nuclear ambitions of its errant ally , and is the latest in a series of expert assessments that suggest @entity11 is moving faster down the nuclear path than previously thought			0
@entity27 inspecting the newly built @entity112 and @entity113 in a photo released earlier this month			0
@entity2 has conducted three nuclear detonations , the most recent in february 2013 in 2012 , @entity11 demonstrated its rocket capabilities by sending a satellite into orbit , but it has yet to conduct a test that would show it had mastered the re-entry technology required for an inter-continental ballistic missile			1
the other key question is how close the @entity2 is to being able to miniaturise a nuclear device that could be fitted on the tip of a missile			2
in a white paper published in january , the @entity127 defence ministry said the @entity129 had already taken its miniaturisation technology to a ' significant ' level			0
under the @entity27 dynasty , represented by current leader @entity27 , @entity2 has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations			0
last month the country 's ambassador to the @entity139 issued a chilling warning that @entity2 would be prepared to use nuclear weapons			2
in a rare interview , @entity142 claimed the secretive state could launch a deadly warhead ' anytime ' .			2

pariah state may have 20 warheads not 10 as previous @entity13 forecasts held
stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within next five years
@entity13 military believes secretive country has ability to miniaturise warhead and mount it on ballistic missile , though there have been no such tests yet
