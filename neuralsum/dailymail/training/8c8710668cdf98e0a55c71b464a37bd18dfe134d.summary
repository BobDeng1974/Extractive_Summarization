by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:12 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 13:32 est , 28 january 2014 even though he seems to have found love in the arms of model @entity6 , @entity3 wo n't be having a sweet @entity8 this year			1
@entity9 has learned exclusively the baby singer is scheduled to be arraigned on that very holiday for his thursday arrest in @entity13 , @entity14 that included a @entity15 , resisting arrest and driving with an expired license			1
meanwhile , the 19 - year - old has been looking like he does n't have a care in the world as he frolicks on a beach in @entity23 with his entourage			1
' he will have to meet with judge @entity30			1
there is already a courtroom assigned to his case			0
' @entity3 already has an attorney , @entity34 , working on his behalf			2
not facing reality : instead of dealing with his management team , the 19 - year - old has been hanging out with his party crew while on vacation ' @entity3 does n't have to be there , ' @entity42 , a @entity13 state attorney 's office spokesman , told people			1
' he will plead non guilty and the process will begin			0
' the @entity48 singer was arrested in the early morning hours of thursday in the @entity50 area after visiting the club set with his father @entity52 , 38 , rapper @entity53 and model @entity54 , aged 21			1
police noticed @entity3 when a street had been closed off for him by friends to make room for a drag race with @entity53			1
the star was pulled over in his rented yellow @entity62 and dropped several f - bombs after being asked to get out of his car and put his hands on his vehicle			2
in trouble : it was not even a week ago when the baby singer had his mug shot taken and was released on $ 2,500 bail the police officer had noted in his report that he smelled alcohol coming from the performer			1
that has now been the subject of a new debate , according to @entity79 , because the singer admitted he had only one beer and the @entity83 level he was tested at came back at only .014 , not the original .04 he was believed to have blown			1
either way , the officer did note that @entity3 was not fit to drive			2
the star did admit to smoking marijuana and taking prescription pills , which could have hindered his ability to operate a vehicle			0
his friend @entity53 had a zero @entity83 level but was still arrested for a @entity15 , according to a monday report from @entity79			1
but the @entity96 rapper could have been under the influence of something else such as marijuana or pills , the site notes			0
musician @entity101 told @entity79 on tuesday he was also pulled over by @entity13 police in december after he left a club			1
the star explained this happens because ' nine times outta 10 they gon na find something ' and suggested @entity3 was too flashy on thursday in his expensive sports car , calling unnecessary attention to himself			2
his ladies : @entity6 ( left ) has been with the star in @entity23 while his ex @entity112 ( right ) , seen here with @entity3 in 2011 , has been shut out having his arraignment fall on @entity8 might be uncomfortable for the singer , who will no doubt be feeling a storm of emotions on the romantic holiday			1
in early january he was seen with his on - again , off - again love interest of two years @entity112			0
he has since been spotted with @entity120 , who @entity121 reported on monday was hoping to sell her story to outlets such as @entity124 and @entity125 about the night of @entity3 's arrest			1
the model was looking to get five figures for her exclusive , but she bowed out of any negotiations after @entity3 whisked her off to @entity23			1
' she hired an attorney and was negotiating a deal with the weekly magazines and the big tv shows , ' a source told the site			0
' she wanted $ 20,000 plus a guaranteed mention of her modeling career			1
' adding to his drama , @entity9 has reported the management team of the believe star is interested in an intervention and sending him to rehab			2
his manager @entity145 is especially keen to get the star help			0
what a mess : @entity3 and @entity6 in the rented @entity62 just before his arrest on thursday in @entity13 on tuesday @entity149 reported @entity150 , the ceo of @entity151 , @entity3 's label , said during a @entity154 party that the performer ' needs an intervention ' soon			1
' i ’m very concerned about him - i ’ve been concerned about him for many months , and [ @entity3 's manager ] @entity145 , who i work with very closely ... is with him at the moment , ' @entity150 said			1
' hopefully , we will all get through to him ...			0
all of us around him need to take all the responsibility , all the pressure off him and give him support so he can address the issues he has - and he does have issues			0
and i ’d like it to be dealt with			0
' the @entity167 reportedly was confronted by @entity145 , his mother @entity168 and mentor @entity169 while in @entity23			0
@entity3 may have bigger problems than his public image			0
on tuesday @entity172 reported his dui could lead to deportation back to @entity174			0
there is already a petition on @entity177 to have the @entity178 kick the star out of the @entity180			0
as of monday there were 40,000 signatures			0
concerned : the @entity184 singer with manager @entity145 , who @entity9 has learned wants his client to go to rehab , in 2012 also on tuesday , r&b singer @entity186 , aged 44 , told @entity187 he believes @entity3 's wild antics are part of a plan to get people even more interested in his music			1
the @entity194 singer - who has worked with top music stars such as @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 - said : ' i think that the mere fact that everyone is talking about @entity3 , and @entity204 , now shows that they know exactly what they 're doing			0
' he added : ' in this day and age there really is n't bad publicity , no matter what has happened			0
with what 's happened with @entity3 these past few weeks he 's probably got a new record that 's about to come out , i would almost bet my life			2
' @entity215 reported on tuesday the @entity217 favorite was filming a music video in @entity23 , most likely for his new song confident			0
in photos , he can be seen singing and gesturing while a camera man recorded his moves			0
@entity3 promised to release a new video this week			0
' he 's got to do something to drum up interest in him so if that means going and getting arrested , or egging his neighbour 's house he does whatever it takes , ' added @entity186			2
police visited the @entity174 's home in january to investigate an alleged egging of a neighbor 's house in his @entity237 gated community called the @entity238 , which resulted in the arrest of the star 's friend @entity240			2
on monday detective @entity242 of the @entity243 told the @entity244 he was still going to present a case to prosecutors even though no evidence has been unearthed in the felony vandalism case where $ 20,000 worth of damage was caused			1
is it all for more fame ? : @entity186 , seen here with @entity200 in 2000 , thinks @entity3 is getting into trouble to bolster his bad - boy image although @entity186 thinks @entity3 's behavior will work for him while he 's young , he is n't sure if he can continue it when he reaches his 30s			1
' at the end of the day , at least he 's got the talent to back up his shenanigans , so i think it 's a good formula for him , ' @entity186 added , ' with the exception of @entity264 , he does n't really have any competition , he 's the only game in town			2
' my only question is , " what do you do next ? " if you 're always trying to top yourself , and it 's not musically topping yourself , what do you do at 30 ? well he 'd probably say , " i 'll be so rich at that point it wo n't matter , " ' @entity186 said .			2

@entity3 will be arraigned in @entity13 , @entity14 on @entity8 by judge @entity30
@entity277 is still vacationing in @entity23 with model @entity6 and his entourage

@entity294 icon @entity186 claimed @entity3 is getting into trouble to build his fame
