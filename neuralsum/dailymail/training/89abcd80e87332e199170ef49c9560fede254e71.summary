launching the investigation , @entity24 commissioner @entity177 said : ' these are serious allegations and the gravity and nature of the allegations , and the fact that they are made against senior officers within the force , means they must be investigated independently			2
' we will also look at the wider organisational response by @entity7 in each of these investigations			0
' we know that the families involved will have been through very distressing times , and we will be sensitive to this as we conduct our investigations			0
' we have a statutory duty to conduct independent investigations in circumstances such as these , but we will make sure that we communicate with the families and do whatever we can to avoid further distress			0
