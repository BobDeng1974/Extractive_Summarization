they say one man 's trash is another man 's treasure and that has certainly proved to be the case for entrepreneur @entity7			1
while supermarkets regularly throw away food that has gone past its ' best before ' date , mr @entity7 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , is now a millionaire after setting up an online business selling out - of - date food to busy mums and bargain hunters			1
the 40 - year - old says the secret to his success is that his business , @entity21 , provides just what the savvy shopper is looking for - quality food at prices which save mums around £ 60 off their weekly bill compared to a similar shop at one of the big supermarkets			1
however , the @entity49 team , which consisted of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , unanimously turned them down			1
not to be thwarted , mr @entity7 and mr @entity47 managed to source £ 400,000 through loans and investments from elsewhere which has seen approved food achieve a £ 4million turnover			1
' it 's all very exciting and we have lots of plans to take the business further , ' said father - of - two mr @entity7			1
he said his journey to success began when he was forced to have a career rethink after being made redundant from his job at an it firm in 2001			2
@entity47 's idea did n't excite @entity49 investors , from left to right , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 inside the @entity21 warehouse which stocks a range of products from toilet roll to dog food bag a bargain : slim - fast mix available for £ .199 and 99p pineapple juice are some of the drinks on offer together with his wife , @entity88 , the pair set up market stalls in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 selling branded chocolate , fizzy drinks and crisps which had been shunned by a range of supermarkets as they were either fast approaching or past their ' best before ' date			1
for six years , come @entity102 , the couple , who hail from @entity10 , sourced and sold the goods to a loyal band of shoppers			0
however , it was after taking delivery of a crate of @entity112 nettle tea that mr @entity7 said he had his ' eureka moment '			1
' i suddenly realised that while there might not be the demand for nettle tea in @entity93 , if i could match the goods with customers looking to buy , i 'd be on to a winner , ' said mr @entity7 , who has two sons , nine - year - old @entity121 and @entity122 , five			1
while still working seven days a week on the market stalls , he utilised all his computer skills to start forming a plan to launch his business , @entity21			1
@entity7 ( right ) with his partner @entity47 at their busy @entity128 check out : the warehouse in @entity131 is dispatching 600 orders a day mr @entity7 also sells household products on his out - of - date goods website ' i was working on my idea wherever i could , ' said mr @entity7			1
' even in my son 's playroom i 'd be beavering away			0
' it was on 14 august 2008 , that mr @entity7 received his very first order , the day after his website went live			1
' i 'd collected the names and address of 300 people who i thought would be interested in buying products which are perfectly fine but have have just gone past their sell by date , ' he said			2
' i was excited sending out the list but even more excited when someone bought something the next day ! ' since then , @entity21 has gone from strength to strength as thrifty mothers and other savvy shoppers make the most of items such as loo roll , dog food , sweets and sauces			2
' there are only two dates people really need to know about , ' explained mr @entity7			1
' the " best before " date which means that the food will be at its optimum before that date and acts as a guide to the quality , and then there 's the " use by " date which is concerned with the safety aspect			1
' it 's only the " use by " date that means food has to be eaten by then or it could make you ill , which is the case with fish and meat , for example			1
' food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its " best before " date , as people know , but the large supermarkets wo n't do that and that 's where we come in			1
@entity7 reveals how he made his millions by selling out - of - date food on tonight 's @entity194 a @entity195 for 29p and 19p @entity197 crisps are among the deals on the @entity21 website busy , busy , busy : the team prepares to pack hundreds of items proving popular with shoppers ' we sell food , such as cans of baked beans , pasta sauce , tins of tuna , which may have gone past their " best before " date by a few weeks , but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run			1
' mr @entity7 said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around £ 40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta , pasta sauce , flour and toilet rolls			1
' by comparison , they 'd be spending around £ 100 at one of the major supermarkets so they 're actually saving around £ 60 which they can then spend on something else			0
' we do n't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish , but we do sell hardy vegetables			2
' currently operating from a huge warehouse in @entity131 and employing 50 full - time staff , he says he can imagine a time when they have bases around the world			2
' i can imagine warehouses in many countries			0
the @entity244 in particular are very savvy shoppers and love branded goods , they also love @entity247 chocolate , so we get a lot of orders , ' he said			0
' we also sell huge @entity252 chocolate bars , which cost around ten pence each to buy from us which is also extremely popular			0
' our biggest customers are by far and away mothers as they 're the ones usually in charge of the purse strings and are always thinking how to feed their families			0
if they 're happy , then so are we			0
' mr @entity7 and @entity21 will be featured on the television programme @entity260 tonight on @entity261 at 8pm			1
the show takes a look at the @entity265 's insatiable appetite for deals and discounts and will also go behind the scenes at @entity270 wholesale giant @entity269 , car supermarket @entity271 and the shoe chain @entity273			0
use by ... you will see ' use by ' dates on food that goes off quickly , such as smoked fish , meat products and ready - prepared salads			1
do n't use any food or drink after the end of the ' use by ' date on the label , even if it looks and smells fine			1
this is because using it after this date could put your health at risk			0
for the ' use by ' date to be a valid guide , you must follow storage instructions such as ‘ keep in a refrigerator ’			0
if you do n't follow these instructions , the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning			0
once a food with a ‘ use by ’ date on it has been opened , you also need to follow any instructions such as ‘ eat within three days of opening ’			1
but remember , if the ‘ use by ’ is tomorrow , then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow , even if the label says ‘ eat within a week of opening ’ and you have only opened the food today			0
if a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the ‘ use by ’ date			2
but make sure you follow any instructions on the pack , such as ‘ cook from frozen ’ or ‘ defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours ’			0
shoppers should make sure they do n't risk their health by eating goods after the end of its use - by date best before ... ‘ best before ’ dates appear on a wide range of frozen , dried , tinned and other foods			2
‘ best before ’ dates are about quality , not safety			0
when the date is passed , it does n't mean that the food will be harmful , but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture			2
eggs can be eaten after their ‘ best before ’ date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid , or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake			0
cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria , such as salmonella			0
people who are in ‘ at - risk ’ groups should only eat eggs , or food containing eggs , that have been thoroughly cooked			2
these groups include : babies and toddlers ; elderly people ; pregnant women ; people who are already unwell			0
every year in the @entity265 we throw away 7.2m tonnes of food and drink , most of which could have been eaten			0
so think carefully before throwing away food past its ‘ best before ’ date			2
remember , the ‘ best before ’ date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label , such as ‘ store in a cool dry place ’ or ‘ keep in the fridge once opened ’			2
display until / sell by ... date marks such as ‘ display until ’ or ‘ sell by ’ often appear near or next to the ‘ best before ’ or ‘ use by ’ date			0
these are instructions for shop staff , not for shoppers			0
the important dates for you to look for are the ‘ use by ’ and ‘ best before ’ dates			0
