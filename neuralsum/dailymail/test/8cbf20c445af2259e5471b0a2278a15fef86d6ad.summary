' my , my ! at @entity1 did surrender , ’ sang @entity3 ’s fab four in their famous @entity5 winner			1
now this may come as a surprise , but you would be well advised not to rely on @entity9 to help with your history homework			1
if @entity13 and @entity14 actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song ( songwriters are not hot on facts – happy to say anything as long as it rhymes ) , they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the @entity24 in @entity25 , just south of @entity26 in @entity27			1
view of @entity29 from @entity30 or @entity31 on the battlefield of @entity25 , @entity27 judging by the photo of @entity9 ’s visit , prominently on view in the museum , the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town			1
my , my : the people of @entity25 must have been delighted			1
@entity1 certainly did n’t surrender at @entity25			1
there was a long day ’s fighting on that june day in 1815 and a very shaky start for the @entity45 team , but thanks to some late - arriving @entity50 assistance , the boy @entity47 eventually done good			2
when @entity1 saw that things were going badly , he hot - footed it to @entity53 , where he later abdicated			1
shortly afterwards , @entity54 was taken by the @entity45 to the remote @entity56 isle of @entity57 , where he died six years later in circumstances that merited the forensic attentions of a @entity60			2
‘ @entity25 ’ quickly entered the @entity62 language as a synonym for ‘ a decisive defeat ’			1
but while the @entity45 know what happened when @entity1 met his @entity25 , the @entity67 - speaking world is less convinced			1
battle of @entity25 reenactors stand in historic costume , with rifles and flags @entity27 is divided into two halves : @entity74 - speaking and @entity67 - speaking			1
it is unfortunate for anniversary - celebrating purposes that @entity25 lies in the @entity67 half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the @entity25 – with @entity1 as the unchallenged star of the show			1
local @entity83 - @entity27 entrepreneur @entity82 has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a @entity88 hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant - cum - brewery ( where he brews @entity25 beer , of course ) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle ( not for the squeamish )			1
it would be fair to say that mr @entity82 is not best pleased by the outbreak of @entity1 - worship			1
he points to the poster advertising the re-enactment event which will be taking place this summer over four days from june 18 to 21 ; the photograph shows a giant , heroic @entity1 towering over the smaller , less impressive figures of @entity47 and @entity50 leader @entity107			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous , ’ says mr @entity82			0
‘ the @entity67 - speaking world refuses to believe @entity1 lost the battle			1
a painting of the @entity25 ; 2015 marks the 200th anniversary of the battle as far as they ’re concerned , he scored some sort of moral victory			1
but they wo n’t accept it			0
’ however , the @entity67 - speaking world – and especially the @entity67 – do n’t figure very significantly in the numbers of tourists who visit the famous battlefield site every year			2
the @entity45 – and the @entity62 - speaking nations of the world – remain fascinated by the victory and the bloody manner in which it was achieved			2
actually , horror - seeking tourists visited the battlefield almost before they had finished burying the bodies			2
poet @entity129 , something of a @entity132 fan , suddenly found he had time to visit the battlefield when his lavish coach , modelled on @entity1 ’s battle carriage , broke down on his journey from the @entity136 to the south			1
' my , my ! at @entity1 did surrender ! ' @entity9 pictured in the town of @entity25 , @entity27 in 1974 in a @entity140 moment , @entity129 treated himself to a charge across the battleground on a large @entity144 horse he had hired , making himself perhaps the first battlefield tourist			1
hard on his heels came poet laureate @entity148 ; sir @entity149 ; the artist @entity150 ; and , a few years later , @entity151			0
it ’s worth recalling that @entity151 , as a young man , had welcomed the @entity154 ( ‘ @entity158 was it in that dawn to be alive … ’ ) but rapidly shifted his political stance to somewhere far to the right of @entity157			0
soon @entity25 was established as one of the great continental sights			1
it was @entity45 tourists visiting @entity25 who discovered the neglected city of @entity166 – largely derelict after its access to the sea silted up – and helped to finance its restoration			1
there was an unmistakable sense that @entity25 had been a defining moment in history : @entity174 had been reshaped and , the odd @entity178 - @entity177 conflict apart , peace reigned for a century			1
the pleasure of the area around @entity25 is that in many ways it has barely changed			1
a statue sits atop the @entity31 , which commemorates the battlefield at @entity25 , @entity27 if you have time , follow the progress of the conflict along @entity187 – what else ? – from @entity189 , where he camped near the @entity67 border on june 14 , to the fields south of @entity25 where he was defeated four days later			2
despite facing superior forces with a hastily assembled army , it is extraordinary that @entity1 came very close to victory			2
@entity47 reflected : ‘ it has been a damned serious business			0
@entity107 and i have lost 30,000 men – the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life ... ’ unbelievable for me was encountering the present @entity204 in the flesh at @entity25			2
he was attending the opening ceremony for a new exhibition at the @entity24 on the ‘ @entity209 ’ of @entity47 and @entity1 , who fought each other often but never met			2
it runs until the end of july			0
my favourite exhibit is lord @entity216 ’s wooden leg			0
at the end of the battle , @entity216 was riding near @entity47 when they came under cannon fire			0
‘ by @entity222 , sir , i ’ve lost my leg ! ’ announced @entity221 , to which @entity47 replied : ‘ by @entity222 , sir , so you have ! ’ @entity216 was taken to the town of @entity25 , where his right leg was amputated above the knee			2
his only recorded comment during the operation was : ‘ the knives appear somewhat blunt			0
’ presumably he had taken advantage of the pint of gin offered as anaesthetic to anyone facing an amputation			0
the severed leg was buried behind the house and its grave became a tourist attraction			0
sadly it is no more , but you can see his wooden limb in the museum			2
perhaps the most interesting sight on the battlefield is @entity29 farm , whose heroic defence by the @entity45 is recognised as the pivotal moment of the battle			0
efforts to restore the property and turn it into a museum were for a long time frustrated by lack of funds , but the project was rescued last year following the intervention of chancellor @entity260 who , it turned out , was something of a battlefield enthusiast			2
an injection of £ 1 million has ensured @entity29 will open to the public for the first time for the celebrations in june , with guests able to stay in a self - catering cottage within the farm – and as far as i could tell from my visit last month , @entity271 is a @entity1 - free zone			1
may marks the 75th anniversary of @entity276 , the evacuation of @entity278 troops from @entity279 @entity279 while june marks the anniversary of a glorious victory , may sees the 75th anniversary of what has sometimes been referred to as a glorious failure : @entity276 – the evacuation of @entity278 troops from the beaches near @entity279 from may 26 to june 4 , 1940			1
the extraordinary rescue , the largest evacuation in military history , saw 338,226 soldiers brought home to @entity292 in the face of ferocious bombing from @entity177 aircraft			0
walk along the wide beach at @entity297 , a 15 - minute drive from the centre of @entity279 , and at first glance there is little to hint at the awful scenes of death and destruction here 75 years ago			2
i was there with @entity307 , a diver who has explored the wrecks on and near the beach – some of the 336 ‘ little ships ’ that set sail from @entity292 , answering the emergency call , but which never returned			0
at low tide you can visit the wreck of the @entity317 , a @entity318 river cruiser that picked up 600 men from the beach but was then bombed by a @entity321			0
with his ship in flames , the captain beached the ship with the hope of saving as many of his passengers as possible , you can find out more about the @entity317 and the other ships at the excellent @entity330 at @entity279			0
also well worth visiting is the @entity331 , built as part of a grand defensive line against possible @entity177 invasion in the @entity335 – and which played its part in the evacuation			0
back on the beach at @entity297 , @entity307 picked up a small black pellet from the beach : ‘ @entity341 from the bunkers of sunken ships – this gets washed up all the time			0
’ the sea is still giving up its war souvenirs			0

contrary to the @entity9 song , @entity1 did not surrender at @entity25
@entity88 hospice is being turned into a restaurant - cum - brewery , museum
may sees the 75th anniversary of ' glorious failure ' of @entity276
