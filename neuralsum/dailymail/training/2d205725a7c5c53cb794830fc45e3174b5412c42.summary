president @entity0 announced an executive order covering ' climate - resilient international development ' on tuesday that will force federal agencies to consider the global - warming impact of international development work , including overseas programs that fight diseases like the ebola virus			1
speaking of climate change during a speech at the @entity11 on tuesday , @entity0 warned that the world must ' tackle this global threat before it is too late			1
' the @entity14 cited ' fighting malaria ' as one example of an initiative that it aims to bring into sync with its position that global climate change is both real and caused by human activity			1
the @entity23 typically engages in such epidemic - related work			2
it has already deployed more than 100 relief workers to @entity28 and @entity29			0
but @entity0 's new order will necessarily mean that the @entity23 and other agencies in his administration will have what one insider called ' an unnecessary hurdle ' to leap over when emergencies normally lead to urgency			1
an official with that agency told @entity51 that she is ' concerned ' about the president 's order , but ' of course we 'll comply			1
i hope this impacts long - term planning more than emergencies			0
' @entity0 's executive order specifically refers to ' agency strategies , planning , programs , projects , investments , overseas facilities , and related funding decisions , ' broad categories that could impact even last - minute decisions like those related to the @entity46 outbreak			1
the @entity23 official noted also that the order does n't appear to impact any of the @entity23 's operations inside the @entity74			1
the @entity14 did not respond to a request for comment			2
the text of @entity0 's executive order , and his @entity11 speech tuesday in @entity79 , indicate that he and his advisers have accepted some of the most apocalyptic predictions of environmental advocates			2
' the adverse impacts of climate change , including sea - level rise , increases in temperatures , more frequent extreme precipitation and heat events , more severe droughts , and increased wildfire activity , along with other impacts of greenhouse gas emissions , such as ocean acidification , threaten to roll back decades of progress in reducing poverty and improving economic growth in vulnerable countries , ' the order reads in part			1
he told the @entity11 that the world will soon be subject to ' more extreme weather events ' that will bring ' impacts that we can unfortunately no longer avoid			0
' ' in @entity74 the last decade has been our hottest on record , ' he claimed , while taking credit for doing ' more than any other nation on earth ' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions			0
but we have to do more			0
' impact : a @entity23 official , the agency currently leading the fight against @entity46 in @entity115 , told @entity51 that she was ' concerned ' about the new orders			1
she added : ' of course we 'll comply			0
i hope this impacts long - term planning more than emergencies ' ' in our west , wildfire season stretches most of the year			0
moments later @entity0 blamed climate change for making @entity74 farmland both ' drenched ' with too much rain and left in ' drought ' by too little			2
' the alarm bells keep ringing , ' he said			0
' our citizens keep marching			0
' @entity0 acknowledged that other nations ' slow responses – when they respond at all – to @entity74 's urging on carbon emissions is rooted in the fear that industrial costs will spiral and change bottom - line business viability			2
@entity0 acknowledged a global ' suspicion that if we act and other countries do n't , we will be at an economic disadvantage			0
' ' none of this is without controversies , ' he said , but ' every country must play its part			0
' internationally , he said the @entity74 would begin considering how global warming will impact its relief and development efforts before putting them into action			1
' development investments in areas as diverse as eradicating malaria , building hydropower facilities , improving agricultural yields , and developing transportation systems , ' said an information sheet provided by the @entity14 , ' will not be effective in the long term if they do not account for impacts such as shifting ranges of disease - carrying mosquitoes , changing water availability , or rising sea levels			2
