by @entity0 published : 04:31 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 7 december 2012 the blunders that turned the @entity3 rail franchise deal into ' a first - class fiasco ' were laid bare yesterday			1
the former transport secretary , @entity6 is pictured the blunders that turned the @entity3 rail franchise deal into ‘ a first - class fiasco ’ were laid bare yesterday			1
the first official reports into the auction found civil servants got their sums wrong when stripping @entity13 of the £ 7billion route			2
ministers have been forced to start the tender process again – costing taxpayers tens of millions of pounds			2
an 84 - page dossier by businessman @entity19 accused the @entity20 of flawed and inadequate planning and producing inaccurate reports			1
however no individual officials or ministers were singled out for blame – a decision that led to claims of a whitewash			2
a second report from the @entity29 flagged up high staff turnover at top levels at the transport ministry as well as job losses at lower levels			2
yesterday the government announced sir @entity37 ’s @entity13 company will continue to operate services on the @entity39 to @entity41 route for another 23 months			1
the flawed tender process had given the contract to @entity44			1
mr @entity19 , chief executive of energy company @entity45 , said there had been ‘ a lack of transparency , inadequate planning and preparation , as well as a complex and confusing organisational structure with weak quality assurance and insufficient governance oversight ’			1
he concluded : ‘ the responsibility of this flawed process rests with the @entity20 rather than with any of its external advisers			2
’ @entity57 said ministers – including @entity6 , who was @entity59 at the time but is now international development secretary – should take responsibility for their ‘ shambolic and incompetent ’ actions			0
@entity65 @entity64 demanded to know why the ‘ sir @entity67 ’ at the heart of the scandal were still in post			0
three middle - ranking civil servants suspended in connection with the botched deal have been reinstated			1
they include commercial and technical director @entity73 , who took her case to the @entity75 claiming she was a political scapegoat			0
sir @entity37 's @entity13 will now run the @entity3 main line for another 23 months as ministers try to get a grip on the shambolic franchise process ministers say the blunder will cost taxpayers at least £ 40million			1
rail unions put the figure at more than £ 100million			0
the @entity86 report shows that outside lawyers raised concerns seven weeks before @entity44 won the contract on august 14			1
transport secretary @entity90 pulled the plug on plans to award the lucrative franchise to @entity44 after serious failings were found in the decision process it highlighted a ‘ lack of clarity ’ , failure to warn superiors of mounting problems and a culture of ‘ limited ownership ’ , ‘ ineffective oversight ’ and risks being ignored because of an overriding pressure to complete the procurement deal on time			1
mr @entity19 said he could find no evidence of an @entity111 bias at the department but he admits his enquiries were hampered because he was not able to see all the emails he had asked for			0
he said the ministry was ‘ excessively stretched ’ due to the spending review and the competing pressures of other projects			0
the @entity29 report said the department had had four permanent secretaries since 2010 and had been hit by staff reductions of up to 30 per cent			0
transport secretary @entity90 , who published the @entity19 report yesterday , told the @entity124 : ‘ i do not hide from the seriousness of his findings			0
they make extremely uncomfortable reading for the department			0
‘ they caused serious problems for the bidding firms , including @entity44 , who were in no way at fault			1
’ he said the prime minister had asked questions during the bidding process but there had been a ‘ damning failure ’ to provide accurate answers			1
@entity143 , the @entity57 mp who chairs the commons public accounts committee , said : ‘ the @entity20 ’s handling of the @entity3 franchise was a first - class fiasco			2
it has left the government ’s entire policy on rail franchising in disarray			0
’ @entity152 , of the @entity154 rail union , said : ‘ this is a classic @entity156 whitewash			0
no one was seriously guilty of anything			0
’ the @entity3 main line is @entity161 's busiest rail route , connecting @entity39 to @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0

sir @entity37 lost the right to run services to rival @entity44
but a flawed bidding process meant the deal had to be torn up
@entity173 blames lack of transparency , *bad* planning and confusion about who was in charge
ministers had asked @entity13 to stay on for a year but today announced a new 23 - month deal while it tries to sort out the mess
*chancellor* @entity185 says it is ' *frustrating* ' as the government *braces* itself for a ' hard - hitting ' report into its botched handling of the deal
