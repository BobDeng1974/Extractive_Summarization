the @entity0 has revealed a radical new laser weapon it says can shoot down missiles , boats and even drones from a warship is already is active service			2
the prototype @entity7 was being tested on the @entity9 in the @entity10 , and was so successfully commanders gave the weapon the go - ahead to use it to defend the ship			1
experts say they also found a surprising second use for the system - as a surveillance tool			2
the prototype 30 kw - class solid - state laser ( @entity33 ) weapon system developed under the leadership of the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , the @entity29 integrates six commercial 5.4 kw fibre lasers with a beam combiner originated by the @entity38			1
a surface warfare weapons officer aboard @entity9 who can operate all functions of the laser - and if commanded , fire the laser weapon			1
using a video game - like controller ( pictured ) , that sailor will be able to manage the laser 's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat , from disabling to complete destruction			1
rear adm. @entity53 , chief of naval research , said that during the test sailors began using the system in ways its developers did n't fully anticipate , such as for long - range surveillance			1
sailors were able to identify approaching vessels at ranges ' they have never dreamed of '			0
the range of surveillance capabilities is a closely guarded secret			2
' we were calling it a @entity71 telescope on the water , ' adm. @entity53 said			0
the prototype , an improved version of the @entity7 ( @entity29 ) , was installed on @entity9 for at - sea testing in the @entity10			1
the prototype 30 kw - class solid - state laser ( @entity33 ) weapon system was developed under the leadership of the @entity35 ( @entity35 )			1
it integrates six commercial 5.4 kw fibre lasers with a beam combiner originated by the @entity38			1
using a video game - like controller , that sailor will be able to manage the laser 's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat , from disabling to complete destruction			1
' this is a revolutionary capability , ' said chief of naval research rear adm. @entity53 said when the tests began			0
' it 's absolutely critical that we get this out to sea with our sailors for these trials , because this very affordable technology is going to change the way we fight and save lives			0
' @entity0 leaders have made directed - energy weapons a top priority to counter what they call asymmetric threats , including unmanned and light aircraft and small attack boats that could be used to deny @entity112 forces access to certain areas			0
high - energy lasers offer an affordable and safe way to target these threats at the speed of light with extreme precision and an unlimited magazine , experts say			0
perfect shot ! the moment the laser weapon blows up an unmanned boat during tests in the @entity10 the weapons was also shown downing a drone with a single blast from its laser ' our nation 's adversaries are pursuing a variety of ways to try and restrict our freedom to operate , ' @entity53 said			1
' spending about $ 1 per shot of a directed - energy source that never runs out gives us an alternative to firing costly munitions at inexpensive threats			0
' as a result of the test , @entity0 officials said they planned to deploy the weapon into the @entity144 for a year aboard the @entity145 , allowing sailors to use the system to track potential threats and defend the ship			2
' we have the authorities right now to use it in self - defense , ' @entity53 said			0
' if someone was coming to harm the @entity9 , we could use this laser system on that threat and we would intend to do so			2
' the @entity0 already has demonstrated the effectiveness of lasers in a variety of maritime settings			0
in a 2011 demonstration , a laser was used to defeat multiple small boat threats from a destroyer			0
in 2012 , @entity29 downed several unmanned aircraft in tests			0
a surface warfare weapons officer aboard @entity9 who can operate all functions of the laser - and if commanded , fire the laser weapon			2
using a video game - like controller , that sailor will be able to manage the laser 's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat , from disabling to complete destruction			1
just one controller is need , who uses a game controller to direct and fire the laser weapon to show its accuracy , researchers put a test missile on an unmanned craft - and the laser was able to hit it perfectly the deployment on @entity145 will prove crucial as the @entity0 continues its push to provide laser weapons to the fleet at large			1
the @entity0 will decide next year which , if any , of the three industry prototypes are suitable to move forward and begin initial ship installation for further testing			0
' we are in the midst of a pivotal transition with a technology that will keep our sailors and @entity203 safe and well - defended for years to come , ' said @entity204 , @entity205 program manager for @entity206			0
' we believe the deployment on @entity145 and @entity206 will pave the way for a future acquisition program of record so we can provide this capability across the fleet			0
' the @entity0 is has declared an experimental laser weapon on its @entity213 ( @entity213 ) in the @entity10 an operational asset and @entity215 has given permission for the commander of the ship to defend itself with the weapon			1
the @entity9 , where the radical weapon is being tested by the @entity0			2

30 kw laser integrates six commercial 5.4 kw fibre lasers into one beam
controlled using a video game controller by a single operator
system can also be used as a long range laser surveillance *scanner*
@entity9 in the @entity10 given go ahead to defend itself with weapon
