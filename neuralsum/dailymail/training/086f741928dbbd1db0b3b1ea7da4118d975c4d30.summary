by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 are running an ill - conceived promotional trailer for the start of the @entity4 season tonight that in no way reflects the diverse support amongst the 72 clubs			1
the ad features supporters drawn from 23 clubs across all three divisions expressing their passion for their team			0
yet remarkably , when inclusion is such an important factor at every level of football , it features only one black fan			1
the blunder comes despite anti-discrimination being at the top of the football agenda and @entity25 chairman @entity24 recently calling the @entity25 council ‘ overwhelmingly white in a world that is n’t ’			1
@entity1 blunder : while @entity24 recently called the @entity25 council ‘ overwhelmingly white in a world that is n’t ’ in their own promotional activities , football bodies are always mindful of displaying the sport ’s hugely diverse following and a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ this was an unfortunate oversight that @entity1 have recognised			1
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ we always try and represent the breadth of football fans and acknowledge we could have done better this time			2
’ it was a close run thing at @entity41 between @entity43 analyst @entity42 and busy @entity45 managing director @entity44 over who spent more time on the playing area before the start of play in the test for no seemingly obvious reason apart from being seen to be there			2
@entity55 irritant @entity53 might have taken @entity57 ’s wicket with the ball of the century at @entity41 in 1993			2
but he had to be reminded by fellow @entity1 commentator @entity59 that the pitch had been turned around before the 2013 @entity62 match in @entity63 at which @entity53 was working for tv			1
meanwhile it ’s become very noticeable since @entity53 ’s chat with @entity67 before the @entity68 that he has quietened down on his previous relentless criticism of the @entity45 captain			2
back in 1993 : the @entity41 pitch @entity53 knew when bowling @entity57 is n't the same anymore lt has emerged former @entity74 overlord @entity72 might be interested in the vacant post of @entity77 chairman			1
certainly @entity72 , responsible for setting up the @entity74 academy that has produced so many top - quality players — only for most of them to be subsequently sold off — knows how the @entity77 works and would n’t be in the pocket of chief executive @entity81			1
ex-soutmapotn man : @entity72 might be interested in the vacant post of @entity77 chairman @entity84 ’s @entity83 @entity86 ’s rebel members , upset at being marginalised at @entity41 , felt even more detached from the corporate - obsessed hierarchy when chief executive @entity84 told them @entity89 ’s born and bred @entity88 had proved a great signing from another county			1
the upset at changes @entity86 have made can be gauged by membership free - falling from more than 14,000 to around 4,500			0
a major grievance is that the dressing - rooms have been located at the opposite end of the ground from the members ’ pavilion , resulting in @entity101 raising his bat to empty stands after scoring a career - best 257			0
upset : @entity86 chief executive toldrebel members @entity88 was signed from another county there is a desire among some sports governing bodies for flexibility in @entity112 ’s zero tolerance towards funding any athlete who does n’t show olympic medal potential — especially for a team sport such as basketball			0
however that view is n’t shared by the high command of @entity112 , who remain steadfast there can be no going back if they want to accomplish their target of improving on doing better than @entity123 by bringing home 66 medals from @entity125			0
certainly @entity126 , @entity127 swimming performance director , is confident enough about his gobbledegook ‘ pathway performance indicators ’ to award himself nine out of 10 for his own ‘ analysis framework ’			0
flexibility : there are calls from some sports for @entity112 to be lenient on their specific funding for @entity137 the torment goes on for former @entity140 ceo @entity139 , who has been in prison in @entity142 since may 18 following a dispute with former @entity140 owners @entity144 , with no charges laid against him nor any date set for a court hearing			0
to add to the @entity140 debacle , colourful agent @entity149 is demanding £ 1m from @entity144 for introducing them to owner @entity152			0
torment : former @entity140 ceo @entity139 is having his legal fees paid , but not the £ 3m bail fee			0

@entity1 to run @entity4 trailer featuring just one black fan
anti-discrimination is *supposedly* top of the football agenda
@entity53 had to be reminded that the @entity41 pitch did n't turn
