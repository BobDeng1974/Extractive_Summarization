by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 18 july 2013 from bins filled with faeces to stealing the batteries from every electrical device in the house , it would seem there is little that holidaymakers wo n't do while staying in a rental home			0
these shocking findings arose after data released by a holiday home insurance provider revealed the extent of guests ' antics and compiled a list of the worst , based on what they left behind			2
among the top 10 horrid holidaymakers was one who filled his rental property with raw meat in a bid to avoid paying the bill and another who replaced his villa 's @entity27 plug sockets with @entity30 ones			1
disgusting : cottages in the @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity33 were among those trashed by horrid holidaymakers the list of gruesome guests is based on a survey of holiday home owners which asked whether they had had any unexpected surprises left by departing guests			1
@entity42 was then collated by insurance company , @entity43 who also put together a list of the worst offenders			0
topping the list was the guest who filled the bin of a @entity30 rental cottage with human waste after misunderstanding a sign that asked holidaymakers to refrain from flushing items down the toilet			1
in second place was a @entity33 guest who tucked raw meat into cracks in the pipes and kitchen cupboards , and an @entity63 tourist who installed a satellite dish complete with cabling and a decoder in his rental property			1
@entity69 : particularly bad were the bathroom bin filled with poo and the plug sockets changed from @entity27 to @entity30 speaking about the findings , @entity74 , spokesperson for @entity75 , said : ' we were interested in discovering some of the weirdest things found and discovered by holiday home owners and , as you can see by the list , there have been some pretty horrific things			1
' the team at @entity43 could not believe what some @entity30 got up to , with the faeces in the bathroom bin definitely the worst			2
he added : ' while i am confident that not every holidaymaker acts like this , you should treat a holiday home as an extension of your own home			0
if you would n't do it in your own home , why would you do it on holiday ? not only will you be banned from coming back , but you ruin the experience for other travellers too			0
a guest in the @entity30 filled a bathroom bin to the brim with human faeces after taking the ' @entity104 ' sign too literally			1
