@entity6 , 51 , shot dead @entity16 as he slept in 1980 and served nearly three decades behind bars before his mother revealed a bombshell : @entity6 was n't actually his father , 87 - year - old songwriter @entity2 was			1
but , perhaps understandably , @entity2 , who 's best known for co-writing @entity3 's @entity22 , ' did n't want anything to do with the father - killer			1
now , @entity6 is trying to force @entity2 to take a paternity test , after he repeatedly refused to acknowledge him as his son			1
according to papers filed in @entity28 , @entity6 says his mom , @entity29 , told him for ' the very first time ' in 2011 that @entity6 was ' not his biological father ' but @entity2 was			1
@entity29 revealed she 'd gone on two dates with the songwriter and conceived @entity6 on the second , allegedly at the home @entity2 still lives in			1
when her son was three she said she 'd contacted @entity2 to tell him he had a son but she said he ignored her			0
@entity29 told her son the two men looked ' strikingly similar ' so she was sure @entity2 was his dad			2
@entity6 said he was ' dumbfounded			0
' by that time he had been out of prison four years and was working as a para-legal for @entity41 , having earned his ged , a bachelor 's degree and a master 's degree behind bars			0
' after much soul searching , some anger , and lots of discussion , ( @entity6 ) decided he wanted to meet @entity2 , ' the suit says , according to the @entity52			1
so @entity6 and his mother wrote him a letter in november 2011 but got no response			2
@entity6 then sent a follow - up , and @entity2 replied simply : ' i decline to take any dna tests			1
very truly yours , @entity2			0
' they tried unsuccessfully to call the now - elderly musician but @entity6 did get his supposed father on the intercom when he showed up at his apartment this spring			2
contact : @entity6 has repeatedly tried to contact @entity2 on the phone and at his @entity66 , @entity13 apartment , pictured , to no avail @entity2 responded ' in a scared , shriek - like voice , " i really do nâ€™t know how to handle this , " ' and then hung up when @entity6 suggested they meet face - to - face			1
@entity6 , however , was not deterred and tried several more times to contact him before receiving a letter back in may , saying , ' i really feel that there is no purpose to be served in our speaking			2
' @entity6 says in the petition , which he wrote himself , that @entity2 ' has done everything in his power to flaunt the law and ignore plaintiff , and his mother , even to this day			1
' he said he wants the ' dna test for a myriad of reasons , but one of the key reasons is to identify whether he is predisposed to any genetic illnesses or diseases , ' in addition to ' his fundamental right to know his background and heritage , and where it derives from			0
' @entity2 refused to comment to the @entity52 on monday , saying simply : ' i really do n't know anything and i have no comment about it			0
' @entity6 acknowledges his father troubles in his petition			0
' on october 24 , 1980 , plaintiff was arrested and accused of the murder of his father , ' the papers state			0
' at the time , he had just turned 19 , was a high - school dropout , ( and ) had a host of personal issues , including a substance abuse problem			0
' he also acknowledges in the suit that state law is n't on his side when it comes to forcing a paternity test as only those up to the age of 21 are allowed to seek dna tests			2
@entity6 said that law 's ' antiquated ' and should be declared unconstitutional because it ' discriminates ' against younger plaintiffs .			0

@entity6 , 51 , shot dead @entity16 as he slept in 1980 and served nearly three decades behind bars
but in 2011 his mother revealed a bombshell : 87 - year - old songwriter @entity2 was actually his father
@entity2 has , *unsurprisingly* , shied away from @entity6 since the *discovery* and *continually* refuses to take a paternity test
@entity6 is now asking a judge to order his ' real dad ' to do so
