under scrutiny : @entity1 earned the money from personal appearances , speech making and hosting a radio show @entity1 used a loophole to avoid £ 50,000 in tax , despite having attacked tax avoiders in the past as ‘ rich b * * * * * * s. ’ @entity12 documents show that @entity15 ’s @entity14 mayoral candidate earned £ 232,000 in 2009 , the first year after his defeat to @entity17			1

it was paid into a personal company set up by mr @entity1 and @entity24 , his then partner who is now his wife			1
the pair are sole shareholders in the company , @entity28 accountants told the @entity30 that the move appears designed to ensure that mr @entity1 paid corporation tax at 20 or 21 per cent , rather than income tax at up to 40 per cent			1
the move is entirely legal			1
three years ago , mr @entity1 criticised tax avoiders , saying : ‘ these rich b * * * * * * s just do n’t get it			2
no one should be allowed to vote in a @entity40 election , let alone sit in @entity41 , unless they pay their full share of tax			2
’ accounts : the money was paid into a personal company set up by mr @entity1 and @entity24 , his then partner who is now his wife a spokesman for mr @entity1 denied he was a tax avoider			1

i mean poor old @entity24 had to spend three years in our attic typing out my autobiography , booking my visits round the world to the mayors of all over the place and it ’s a very demanding job			0
‘ but the other thing is , you know , i ’ve used that to pay for other people to work on the campaign for mayor and so on , and i do n’t think that anyone really in @entity40 pays income tax on the money they use to employ other people to work for them			2
