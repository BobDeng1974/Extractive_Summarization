this is the makeshift barracks where thousands of troops will live while on guard duty at the @entity4			2
the complex at @entity6 , @entity7 , looks more like a prisoner - of - war camp than a military base			1
work on the grey metal accommodation blocks started four months ago			1
now almost complete , they provide spartan living space , with washing and toilet facilities , for 3,000 @entity16 personnel , some of whom have served in @entity19 and @entity20			1
from sand to soil : troops arrive at the @entity25 camp at @entity26 in @entity7 home sweet home : tents at the camp which will house catering staff and supplies tents on the site house a catering area and a recreational centre where the soldiers can relax when off - duty			1
alongside the temporary portable homes is the more comfortable - looking @entity38 , a larger unit comprising single and double rooms for 1,000 @entity42 support workers and civilian personnel			1
the camp is protected by a wire mesh fence with white sheeting stretched across it for privacy			2
troops based on the @entity42 - controlled site are due to man x-ray machines , search visitors and monitor @entity52 at the @entity53			2
high - tech : a @entity56 missile battery is deployed at @entity57 , @entity59 - @entity58 new walls , please : anti-terrorism fencing and security is erected at the @entity63 in @entity64 but despite the @entity4 beginning in less than two weeks , the camp in the 250 - acre @entity26 looked far from finished yesterday			1
one employee said construction had fallen behind schedule because of the poor weather , and work had been going on through the night			0
about a quarter of the dormitory accommodation for troops is still to be completed			2
vast vessel : the @entity76 's largest ship has been carefully manoeuvred into position on the @entity78 , where it will be used during the @entity4 as a base for helicopters and military personnel in action : the pair will be two of thousands who will be in @entity86 aiming to ensure that @entity87 is safe from terror attacks logistics : the men look across the @entity58 skyline and consider what faces them over the coming weeks as @entity93 turns in to the @entity78 150 sailors and aircrew recreate the @entity96 on the flight deck to mark the start of the ship 's @entity25 deployment the wet summer has turned the area into a quagmire , but one soldier said : ‘ we ’re used to this			1
some of us have been to @entity20 and it can be really wet and muddy out there			0
’ elsewhere , the @entity63 ’s complex at @entity64 was receiving a security makeover , while a @entity56 missile defence battery was deployed in @entity57 , @entity58 , near the site of the equestrian events			2
troops on duty for the @entity4 should get the same £ 500 bonus being given to @entity119 drivers , @entity114 demanded last night			0
shadow defence secretary @entity120 called on the @entity121 and disgraced security firm @entity42 to foot an £ 8.5 million bill to give the troops an extra @entity25 payment			0
he said all troops on @entity4 duty – including the 3,500 being drafted in because of @entity42 ’s failure to recruit enough civilian staff – should receive the same £ 500 bonus won by @entity119 drivers			0
demands : troops on duty for the @entity4 should get the same £ 500 bonus being given to @entity119 drivers , mps claimed work : men continue to file in with items to prepare and install the missile launcher bus drivers have a similar deal for working through the @entity4 after going on strike for the extra payments			0
mr @entity120 said : ‘ just because our troops ca n’t strike , it does n’t mean they should be ignored			0
@entity142 and people across @entity86 wo n’t accept our forces being treated less fairly than @entity119 and bus drivers			0
’ @entity147 sources said the department was looking at measures to recognise the @entity16 ’ @entity25 role , but one said it would be ‘ strange ’ to pay troops extra for their @entity25 work while their colleagues were on the frontline in @entity20			1
the @entity147 has said that the thousands of additional servicemen and women being drafted in will be compensated for any expenses such as cancelled holidays .			0
