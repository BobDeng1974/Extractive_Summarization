@entity0 has condemned a phone app made by schoolchildren featuring a character called @entity4 kicking immigrants off the @entity6			1
the @entity8 leader said the game where players kick immigrants as far as possible to gain the highest ' racism ' rating is ' risible and pathetic ' and ' crosses the line '			1
but @entity16 principal @entity15 said the technology class ' project was ' just a bit of fun '			1
mr @entity0 said he accepted criticism as a public figure but attacked the implication @entity8 was racist			1
he said : ' those elements are risible and in many ways pathetic			1
i think i 'm quite well known for having a sense of humour			2
i 'm a public figure and of course people are going to have views			2
but elements of this game appear to cross the line			1
' he added : ' fair play to them for having a bit of fun			0
if they want to go away and look at @entity8 policies , they will actually learn a lot			1
' the game features an apparent manifesto from the fictional @entity4 , @entity60 leader , saying : ' if you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote @entity63 this may			1
' these people might improve our economy , contribute to our culture and make @entity68 great but they are different to us so let 's kick them all out ! ' the student developers , who have formed game design company @entity30 , say the game called @entity32 aims to ' make a mockery of extremist views ' mr @entity0 said he accepted criticism as a public figure , but elements of the same - such as the use of the term ' racism ' - were unacceptable the migrant - kicking ' @entity32 ' game was developed by a group of 18 - year - old students from @entity16 - @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
it is available on @entity91 , where it has been given a five - star rating by 60 players			0
according to the game 's disclaimer , it was developed to ' highlight the importance of a diverse culture for our great nation as well as make a mockery of extremist views '			1
its description reads : ' if you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote @entity63 this may			0
' principal mr @entity15 said : ' it 's certainly topical and should stimulate discussion about political issues amongst young people - something we are constantly told is important			0
' but , really as political satire it is just a bit of fun			0
many politicians do n't need help to make themselves look daft , or to say very silly things , but they should at least have the ability to laugh at themselves			2
' this game may be a bit ' edgy ' but i suspect it will not bring the @entity68 political system crashing down ! ' the game has been developed by 18 - year - olds @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
the group are all learning coding , graphic design and game development and have been making mobile games about spaceships and platform games			2
@entity30 describes itself as ' a team of developers who create games based upon controversial news stories for the purposes of entertainment and to encourage political discussion amongst young people			0
' @entity16 principal @entity15 said the technology class ' project was ' just a bit of fun ' @entity148 , a co-founder of @entity149 , which was set up at the @entity16 campus two years ago with the aim of fast - tracking 16 to 24 - year - olds into setting up their own digital businesses , said : ' what 's great about @entity63 is that it has been created by young people to encourage others of their age to start talking about politics			1
' it 's irreverent and a game based upon the @entity68 tradition of political satire that pokes fun at a high profile figure and should not be taken too seriously as it is entertainment			2
' a @entity8 parliamentary candidate has claimed a ' homosexual donkey ' tried to rape his horse			2
@entity171 , who is running for @entity172 and @entity173 in may 's general election , told the story to protesters outside a new campaign office in @entity178			0
an @entity180 demonstrator had asked him about controversial remarks by fellow party members - including on from dr @entity183 in @entity184 , who allegedly claimed that ' some homosexuals prefer sex with animals ' mr @entity171 replied : ' actually , i 've witnessed that			0
i 've got a horse and it was there in the field			0
and a donkey came up â€¦ which was male , and i 'm afraid tried to rape my horse			0
' the horse bit the ' homosexual donkey ' in defence , the former soldier said			0
he added : ' i do n't think that 's what she meant but it 's a coincidence			0
