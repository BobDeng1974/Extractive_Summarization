women who claim @entity1 promotes domestic violence and glamorises abusive relationships are rallying outside the film 's @entity5 premiere in protest			1
feminist campaigners @entity9 say the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men			2
a handful of men and women stood outside the central @entity18 premiere in @entity19 today , unfurling a banner calling @entity1 ' a rapist ' as stars made their way along the red carpet			1
' there is no part of the movie where [ @entity48 ] is abused			2
all the choices she makes are her choices and it 's all consensual , ' she told the @entity52			0
' @entity53 is a woman with incredible integrity and strength			0
i think that she is fearlessly exploring her strength and sexuality and i think that 's a beautiful thing			0
@entity39 said the film did not show her character being abused ' i would love for [ the protesters ] to see the movie which i think has the opposite message			1
' ahead of the release of the controversial film on @entity70 , activists called on the public to consider whether they should endorse the movie			1
@entity73 , who runs campaign group @entity30 , said the story portrays an abusive relationship			2
she said that if readers consider the lead character , @entity1 's behavior out of context it would appear extremely alarming rather than alluring			1
she said : ' is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone , when somebody knows where you live before you tell them , sells your only means of transport , or buys the company you work for ? ' how can you marry that with being romantic ? ' ms @entity73 , who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women , said that after reading all three books , she was left ' deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated '			0
she added : ' the thing that i would say to people who are reading the books , who are going to see it , is , if he was n't rich and very attractive , would this behaviour be normal ? ' the group asked users to take photos of placards that explain why the story is offensive to them , beginning with ' @entity1 is ... ' one photo sees a victim holding up a sign that says : ' @entity1 is ... telling survivors that what happened to us is really just " romance " '			1
a handful of men and women stood outside the central @entity18 premiere in @entity19 today , holding placards and chanting slogans proof ? the @entity35 account posted this picture where a reader had folded down all the pages in the trilogy of novels where there was abuse mentioned , and the result was shocking distasteful : victims of domestic violence say that @entity138 ' book trivialises what they have been through the group does n't wish to censor , they want to make viewers and readers aware of the concerning themes amid the protests , some @entity1 fans dressed up and spanked each other as they waited outside the cinema another says : ' @entity1 is ... giving the dangerous impression that unwanted control , manipulation and stalking are forms of love			1
' she also criticised ' exploitative ' retailers who had taken advantage of the franchise 's popularity and created branded merchandising to cash in on the publicity			0
the books , written by @entity138 , follow the sado - masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists , @entity166 billionaire @entity1 and demure student @entity1			2
ms @entity73 said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel ' we are not against @entity176 ( bondage , discipline , sadism and masochism ) , it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence			2
' i have spoken to people who have said that he ( @entity1 ) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is			1
' it is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love			0
' ms @entity73 said the aim of the protest is not to prevent people from seeing the film but to make viewers aware of what they are ignoring			0
@entity39 and @entity203 share a joke as they arrive at the @entity18 premiere this evening @entity207 ( left ) and @entity208 slept in @entity19 last night in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the stars at the premiere die - hard enthusiasts slept out overnight with others arriving before sunrise			1
but the film has failed to get critics hot under the collar ' it is not about censorship - people have the absolute right to go and watch it - but there is something about the credibility that is given by the number of people who go and watch it			0
' she further expressed her concerns that the franchise has become part of everyday life , with some cinemas even hosting ' mummy and baby screenings '			0
die - hard @entity1 enthusiasts slept out overnight , with others arriving before sunrise today , hoping to be first in the queue to catch a glimpse of the stars as they arrived at the premiere			2
after endless hype , excitement hit fever pitch at the film 's world premiere in @entity248 last night , as screaming fans scrambled to get a selfie on the red carpet with stars @entity203 and @entity39 , who play @entity1 and his lover @entity1			1
the film is also expected to be a hit at the box office , with more than Â£ 1million in ticket sales a week before it opens			0
