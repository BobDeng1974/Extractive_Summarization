by @entity0 a mother waited 10 hours to go to hospital with her badly injured baby son who later died because of a violent beating inflicted by her housemate , a jury was told today			1
seven - week - old @entity9 suffered broken ribs and began bleeding from both eyes while his @entity13 mother , @entity12 , was out shopping , but she failed to take him to @entity15 , a court heard			1
@entity12 returned to their home in @entity18 , @entity19 , and she noticed a cut and bruising around her son 's lip			2
@entity12 , 24 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , is accused of causing or allowing the death of a child she was told by fellow pole , @entity26 , he had fallen asleep and that @entity9 must have banged his mouth on the frame of his cradle			1
@entity30 heard the youngster was admitted to @entity32 late on january 25 with multiple bruises all over his body , severe retinal bleeding in both eyes and was noted to be pale , unresponsive and having a seizure			2
he was transferred to @entity38 but was pronounced dead two days later			2
prosecutor @entity39 said @entity9 's body was examined by a number of medical experts including a consultant paediatrician who concluded the number of bruises - 25 different sites - were ' suggestive of inflicted injuries and are not consistent with accidental injuries to a non-mobile baby '			2
@entity12 is accused of waiting ten hours before taking her baby son to hospital after he suffered fatal injuries he added : ' in particular she noted that the injuries to both ears were unusual and would suggest either an impact with a hard surface or that he had been slapped across the face			1
' the post-mortem examination also revealed that @entity9 had four fractured ribs said to have been caused in the days before he suffered the fatal head injury			1
mr @entity63 said the expert view was that the most probable cause was non-accidental and the amount of force required would be ' considerable , even on a baby of this age '			0
there was also evidence of a minor bleed to the brain in the same period as the broken ribs , the jury was told			2
the prosecutor said @entity12 , 24 , came to the @entity77 in 2010 but had no contact with @entity9 's father who was unaware the child was his			1
@entity26 , 26 , lived with them and often acted as carer for her son , as did @entity12 's boyfriend , @entity85 , 35 , a frequent visitor to the address			1
mr @entity63 said : ' the prosecution say that up to and including the health visitor 's examination of @entity9 on january 17 he was a healthy , growing baby with no medical problems			0
' we know at some stage between january 22 and january 25 someone within that household unlawfully caused injury to @entity9 either by striking him or squeezing him , causing four fractures to the ribs on the left side of his body			0
' on january 25 , @entity12 left the baby in the house with @entity26 at 9am and did not return until 1pm , the jury heard			1
seven - week - old @entity9 was taken to @entity38 , pictured , but was pronounced dead two days later she found @entity9 in a rocker in the downstairs bedroom of her compatriot who was asleep and when she confronted him about the injuries to his face he told her it must have been an accident			1
@entity85 later arrived at the house just after 2pm , said mr @entity63			0
all three defendants initially told medics and police that @entity12 was alone in the house all day and she accidentally tripped on the stairs , dropped her son and then fell on him			0
each later changed their accounts but the prosecutor said the jury was entitled to ask whey they had told ' a pack of lies '			0
mr @entity63 said : ' why did the three defendants agree to lie about what happened to @entity9 ? was it because they feared the @entity124 coming in asking questions or was there some other motive for shielding the truth from the hospital staff and police ? ' it emerged that @entity12 and @entity26 made a number of @entity134 searches in the hours before @entity9 was taken to hospital in which they inquired about head injuries to babies			1
@entity85 told police that during the internet searches his co-defendants were sat on the sofa with his girlfriend reading out the symptoms , including ' the baby staring in one place '			0
mr @entity63 told the jury : ' the prosecution case against these three defendants is that they were each involved in a series of events which led to the unlawful killing of this baby			0
' all three defendants deny causing or allowing the death of a child			0
@entity26 has also pleaded not guilty to manslaughter			0
the trial is expected to last up to three weeks			0
