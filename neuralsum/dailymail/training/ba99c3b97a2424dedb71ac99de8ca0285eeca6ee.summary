by @entity0 published : 04:14 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 10:15 est , 28 june 2012 the threat many families face of losing their home has been starkly highlighted , as the towns and cities most at risk are revealed			1
the list shows the risk is spread across @entity9 , and not just confined to the north of the country where public sector austerity and weak economic growth has hit areas hard			1
the hot spot table shows homeowners in @entity17 and the east of @entity9 are also struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and are issued repossession warnings			1
but a separate study showed that those in the south of the country were more likely to survive from the repossession claim , and cling on to their home			1
housing charity shelter compiled the list of possession claims using figures recorded by the @entity31			2
a possession claim is the first step in a property being taking away from its owner , though not all cases end in repossession			2
new figures obtained by housing charity shelter show the risk of repossession is spread across the country topping the bleak list is @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity17 , where more than twice as many homes face repossession as the national average - as many as eight in every 1,000 properties			1
@entity50 in the @entity51 and @entity52 in the @entity53 followed closely behind the top two , while @entity55 in south @entity17 and @entity56 , also in the @entity51 , came in at fourth and fifth place respectively			0
chief executive of @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ‘ most people think that repossession will never happen to them , but rising unemployment , rising living costs and high house prices mean that many people are living close to the edge already , and risk falling into a spiral of debt and repossession			1
‘ the journey from being a homeowner to becoming homeless is frighteningly swift , with just one small thing like a wage cut , a health problem or a job loss meaning that a family can no longer meet their mortgage payments			0
this map shows the area most at risk of repossession claims , based on government data ' when repossession happens , the impact on families is devastating - research shows people think repossession is worse than having to fight a child custody battle			1
' however , further research shows that those in the north of the country are less likely to survive the risk , and will lose their homes			1
an analysis of court - ordered repossessions in the second half of 2011 , by chartered surveyors @entity103 , found that the @entity104 and the @entity106 corridor were the regions where repossessions are rife			2
@entity109 , business development director of e.surv , said : ‘ spending cuts , negative real wage growth , falling house prices and public sector unemployment have hit the @entity51 much harder than the @entity115			0
' this has opened up a gaping geographical divide in repossessions levels			2
’ researchers said they found a strong link between rising unemployment and repossession claims , with the towns and cities facing the highest risk also suffering a faster rate of unemployment			1
housing minister @entity128 said he is determined to help people facing the frightening possibility of loosing their home as well as facing tougher criteria to take out a mortgage , borrowers have also been hit by a steady rise in rates for new mortgages in recent months , despite record low interest rates , as lenders deal with the increased cost of funding a mortgage amid the weak economy and the ongoing eurozone crisis			2
more than a million existing mortgage borrowers also saw their rates rise last month as a string of lenders put them up			0
mr @entity60 added : ‘ @entity149 is the largest monthly cost for many homeowners , yet the affordability of housing is not getting the same government attention as the monthly costs of other essentials such as food or energy bills			0
’ he said those struggling with mortgage arrears should contact their mortgage provider to avoid repossession and seek advice from bodies such as @entity59			0
housing minister @entity128 said : ‘ by tackling the record deficit we inherited we ’ve prevented the need for rapid rises in interest rates that would have put pressure on hard - working families , meaning repossessions are at their lowest level since 2007			0
‘ but i ’m determined that help is available to those facing the real and frightening prospect of losing their home			1
‘ that ’s why i ’ve given £ 19 million to councils so they can offer short - term loans to struggling homeowners , and over £ 3 million to the @entity184 , run by @entity59 , to ensure help is on hand to families when they need it most			0
‘ like @entity59 , i would urge anyone struggling with their mortgage to seek early help , so that repossession is always the last resort			0
” the table shows the areas suffering from the highest repossession rate			2
data collected by chartered surveyors @entity103 the table shows where the repossession rate is the lowest			0
