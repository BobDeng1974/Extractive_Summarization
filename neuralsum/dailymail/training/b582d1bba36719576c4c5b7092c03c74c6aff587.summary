police made a dawn raid on four houses which were home to a @entity6 ' car fraud gang ' , and seized £ 30,000 in cash and a top - of - the - range @entity8 from the house at the centre of their £ 1 million scam their scam allegedly involved bonus car adverts that were targeting thousands of motorists looking for cut priced cars on websites like @entity38 and @entity39			1
the gang members allegedly stole money from the ' buyers ' without ever parting with the vehicles they had advertised for sale			2
they are accused of then laundering the money through phoney accounts , withdrawing cash from cash points or transferring it straight out of @entity49			2
the alleged scam is thought to have hooked its prey by offering prospective buyers the chance to put money in a holding account before the final payments , followed by a test drive so a buyer could be sure about the purchase			1
however , once the money transfer was made , the fraudsters would withdraw the money from the account , so the prospective buyer could not retrieve it			0
police also said ' mules ” were paid to open account at banks using fake documents in order to launder the proceeds of the frauds			0
hundreds of ordinary @entity72 looking for cars worth between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000 are thought to have been caught in the alleged scam			1
a 30 - year - old man was arrested in @entity75 and is being questioned on suspicion of fraud and money laundering			1
a 30 - year - old man was arresting during the raid which was part of @entity80			2
the scam allegedly involved bonus car adverts that were targeting thousands of motorists looking for cut priced cars on websites like @entity38 and @entity39 a 63 - year - old woman was also arrested , by the @entity88 , on suspicion of being in possession of fraudulent immigration documents			1
at the alleged ' @entity22 factory ' police found fake documents , two laptops , seven mobile phones and memory sticks , thought to be for use in opening fake bank accounts for money laundering			1

they were made by officers from @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , as well as officials from the @entity109			0
head of the new squad , detective chief inspector @entity110 , said : ' the fact that the unit consists of detectives from the three police forces serving the @entity12 region is evidence of the wider commitment from law enforcement to really clamp down on economic crime			2
' with organised crime gangs increasingly targeting people who are prepared to make large purchases online , i would expect internet - related investigations and arrests to be a major focus for us over the coming months - with many more early morning visits to the homes of key suspects			2
' a police spokesman said : ' buyers who express an interest have been receiving emails , supposedly from @entity137 , offering to hold payment for the vehicle in an escrow account until it has been viewed and a price agreed			0
' in theory , this would allow the buyer to release the funds securely rather than having to carry around thousands of pounds in cash			0
' in reality , victims are finding the advert to be bogus and the money they transferred to have been quickly withdrawn - often out of cash machines - from bank accounts set - up with false details			0
' @entity154 said : ' i want people to be extremely cautious online and check what sort of payment or banking facility they enter into as you do n’t know who you are dealing with until you have met them in person			0
