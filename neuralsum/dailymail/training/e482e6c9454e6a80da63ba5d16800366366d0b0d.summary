two - thirds of @entity3 people feel uncomfortable or awkward talking to somebody who is disabled , new research has shown			1
a fear of seeming patronising or saying the wrong thing causes people to worry about what they say around those with a disability , a new report by charity scope has found			1
the study sheds light on why disabled people continue to face negative public attitudes , the charity said today			1
and one - fifth of 18 to 34 - year - olds have actually avoided talking to a disabled person because they were not sure how to communicate with them			1
off the back of the findings , @entity31 has today launched a new national advertising campaign which uses comedy to shine a light on the awkwardness that many people feel about disability			2
the adverts , which premiere on national television this sunday , are fronted by comedian and presenter @entity43 , best - known for his role on @entity46 ’s @entity45 , which is now into its 4th series since the @entity48			0
they show mr @entity43 guiding viewers through a series of awkward situations that they may encounter with a disabled person , such as ' the awkward " i ’ve bent down to speak to a wheelchair user , now what ? " situation '			0
mr @entity43 , who has a prosthetic leg and hand and arm disabilities , said he hopes the campaign will get people talking about , rather than avoiding , the issue of disability			2
appearing on @entity66 comedian and tv presenter @entity43 discussed the issue			0
he said : ' some people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not it 's coming from a good place because it 's just someone not wanting to offend ' he said : ' some people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not it 's coming from a good place because it 's just someone not wanting to offend			2
' i do n't see anything wrong with being curious , i would be if i saw someone different and i 'm disabled myself			0
' it 's just about getting past that and feeling confident because a disability is only a part of who someone is i think			0
' @entity46 ’s coverage of the @entity48 had a huge impact and research at the time indicated that it changed perceptions about disability amongst viewers			0
@entity94 , @entity31 ’s ceo , said : ' awkward situations can be funny			0
we ’ve all been in situations that have made us cringe			0
nearly half of the @entity3 - 43 per cent - do not personally know anyone who is disabled two - thirds - 67 per cent - of those surveyed said that they would worry about speaking about disability in front of a disabled person , with many worrying they would say something inappropriate or use an offensive term by mistake many people said that getting to know someone disabled - 33 per cent - or getting advice from disabled people - 28 per cent - would make them feel more confident when meeting a disabled person ' but imagine if every day , people avoided talking to you because they were n’t sure what to say or how to act			1
' that ’s the situation that many disabled people face today			1
' we wanted to raise this issue in a light - hearted way , because it is n’t about pointing fingers			0
' not enough people know a disabled person , or know enough about disability			0
this can mean people worry about saying or doing the wrong thing and feel awkward			2
' but it can also have a serious side			0
' in 2014 disabled people face many challenges			1
many disabled people continue to face negative attitudes , in the playground , in the street , and from employers			1
' we ’ve launched this campaign to get us all thinking about what we can do to include disabled people more in our lives			2
' while the adverts are light - hearted , @entity31 wants to highlight the negative impact of discomfort about disability on disabled people ’s lives			1
recent analysis released by @entity31 revealed that in 2014 , disabled people have higher aspirations than ever before , but that many disabled people feel that public attitudes to disability are still playing ' catch up '			1
@entity31 ’s research reveals that when asked whose attitude most needs to change , disabled people were most likely to say the general public .			2
