by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 13:02 est , 8 april 2013 when former music promoter and journalist @entity2 rolled up outside his new home in @entity5 in 2005 , he did so with three articulated lorries full of his possessions in tow			1
the historic house called the hoods , in the pretty village of @entity12 near @entity13 , had a large double - storey annexe – the perfect space to accommodate the contents of those vast lorries			1
for inside were 50,000 @entity19 – mostly by @entity20 and @entity21 ’ n ’ b artists – as well as @entity2 ’s collection of 850 beer bottles			2
great tales : @entity2 , former pr man for @entity20 's biggest voices , is selling his four - bedroom historic home in @entity5 for £ 495,000 and although the @entity30 listed house has parts dating back to the 16th and @entity33 , he was able to move straight in			1
‘ i hired a surveyor who specialised in old houses and he said the only work that was necessary was to empty some leaves out of a drain , ’ he said			2
‘ this house was obviously built to last – it was here 500 years before i got here and will still be standing 500 years after i ’ve left			2
so i saw no reason to change things			0
’ but the previous owners made one small but vital alteration before they left			0
while removing plaster in the living room , they discovered an ornate 16th century fresco			1
it ’s a picture of @entity49 and carries script from the @entity51			0
the fresco was covered up during @entity53 ’s time when depictions of figures in the @entity51 were considered blasphemous			0
come to my @entity56 : the hoods in @entity59 , near @entity13 in @entity5 dates back to the 16th century open space : the house boasts wooden beams , open fireplaces and exposed brickwork in the large front room unique : the ornate 16th century fresco shows @entity49 and carries script from the @entity51 and is one of 12 remaining frescoes from that period it has been authenticated by experts from the @entity73 and is one of only 12 frescoes from the period left in @entity77			1
but it ’s not the only reminder of the past in this four - bedroom house			1
exposed oak beams , brick fireplaces and floorboards leave visitors in no doubt that @entity87 has enjoyed a glorious history			0
the property , on the market for £ 495,000 , also has plenty to offer gardeners , with a well - established 165ft plot			1
and of course the annexe has great potential as a granny flat or accommodation for teenagers preparing to fly the nest			0
@entity2 , 71 , moved to @entity5 from @entity100 to be near his daughter , who ran a local pub. she has moved back to @entity100 and @entity2 , who now less mobile , is selling up because he needs a home with no stairs			1
most of his record collection has been sold , but what ’s left would be the envy of any music fan – a reminder of @entity2 ’s career in the business when he was the publicist on tours for @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 of @entity118 and @entity118 fame			2
he recalls with a chuckle : ‘ i was there when @entity115 famously stood up princess @entity122			0
he was performing at the @entity123 in @entity124 and she requested he had dinner with her before the show			0
‘ he was staying at the @entity127 in @entity128 and we just could n’t get him out of his room , so princess @entity122 was kept waiting at the table			0
' we had to ring @entity132 , the top guy at @entity20 , to persuade @entity115 to come down , but when we got to the venue , princess @entity122 had gone and @entity115 started complaining that she had stood him up ! ’ @entity134 , 01376 348444 ; @entity135			2
