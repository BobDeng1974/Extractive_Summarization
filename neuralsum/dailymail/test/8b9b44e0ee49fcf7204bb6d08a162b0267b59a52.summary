@entity1 manager @entity0 was feeling less vibrant than his team 's bright orange strip after they blew a chance to climb into the play - off places			1
the @entity1 , who have now lost four of their last five away games , were caught cold by goals in the opening 30 minutes by @entity13 strike pair @entity11 and @entity14			1
@entity0 responded by making two changes at half - time and was rewarded when @entity17 reduced arrears earlier in the second period			1
@entity20 celebrates after giving his @entity13 side the lead at the @entity23 @entity14 ( right ) doubled the lead for the home side and dent @entity1 's play - off hopes @entity13 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity14 ; @entity32 ( @entity33 89 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity11 ( @entity36 83 ) , @entity14 ( @entity37 90 ) goals : @entity11 12 , @entity14 30 @entity1 : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity28 , @entity41 , @entity42 ; @entity43 ( @entity44 45 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 67 ) ; @entity17 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 45 ) goal : @entity17 48 bookings : @entity28 , @entity41 but @entity1 could n't force an equaliser let alone manage the victory that would have seen them leapfrog @entity56 into the top six			1
' we were poor â€“ nowhere near as competitive as usual , ' said @entity0			0
' i was very angry at half - time and strong words were spoken			0
' i had to walk off at the end to calm down slightly rather than shake all the players ' hands			0
it 's been disappointing , let 's leave it at that			0
' @entity13 , who had n't won in seven matches , went ahead after 12 minutes			0
@entity11 capitalised on loose play from @entity72 and curled a left - footer into the corner for his 13th goal of the season			1
@entity17 ( centre left ) heads home early in the second half but it was n't enough for @entity0 's men after @entity1 's 23 - goal top scorer @entity48 had seen an effort cleared off the line , the home side extended their lead after half - an - hour when @entity14 rose well to head in @entity35 's cross at the far post			1
@entity17 headed a goal back after 48 minutes but @entity13 deservedly held out to leave manager @entity91 declaring : ' we deserved it			1
' our first - half display was arguably the best we 've played since i 've been here			0
' @entity14 and @entity11 took it to them from minute one			2
fortunately for @entity1 's promotion hopes , three of their remaining five matches are at @entity100 starting with bottom - of - the - table @entity102 on saturday			2
@entity0 added : ' i do n't feel happy - slappy at the moment but me and ( assistant ) @entity104 will watch this game back at seven o'clock in the morning and we 'll start preparing for the next one			0
' i do n't have any fears about the response on saturday			0
' @entity0 ( right ) looks down as his side failed to keep up with the pace of their promotion rivals @entity50 ( centre ) and @entity28 compete for the ball as @entity1 chased a late equaliser			2

@entity20 opened the scoring after an error from on - loan @entity72
@entity14 doubled the advantage after 30 minutes for the home side
@entity17 pulled one back for @entity1 *straight* after the break
@entity1 have now lost four out of five away in the *championship*
