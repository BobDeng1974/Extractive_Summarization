@entity0 is holding his cards close to his chest with @entity4 ’s squad due to be announced this week			1
@entity4 meet @entity5 at @entity6 in @entity8 qualifying on march 27 before travelling to the @entity9 in @entity10 for a friendly with @entity12 four days later			1
the last time @entity4 played was in mid-november , when they beat @entity14 and @entity15 with @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
yet the contenders have arrived			0
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are among those that could be selected , and @entity0 is set to pick four from the eight available			1
so , stick or twist ? well , here are the numbers that may sway @entity0 ’s decision one way or another			2
@entity4 captain @entity16 , pictured celebrating against @entity14 , looks a certainty to be picked @entity21 , @entity33 against @entity34 on february 7 , @entity21 scored twice in front of watching @entity4 manager @entity0 to win the north @entity37 derby			1
it was deja vu on march 8 , when the 21 - year - old added two more against @entity41 yet again in front of the @entity4 manager			2
if that does n’t convince , perhaps these statistics will : only @entity46 and @entity47 ( both 41 ) have scored more than @entity21 ( 26 ) in all competitions this season only @entity49 and @entity50 ( both 17 ) have more @entity52 goals but @entity21 ( 16 ) did not start a game until november 9 @entity21 has scored 14 in his last 13 @entity52 games and became the fourth player in history to score in six consecutive away games his goals have contributed a staggering 19 points in the @entity52 this season and we could go on			2
@entity21 is used to leading a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 at @entity33 , and would have to adapt to a partnership in @entity0 ’s classic 4 - 4 - 2 midfield diamond formation			1
even so , the question is not should @entity0 pick the highest scoring @entity64 , but rather how could he not ? verdict : @entity65 @entity33 striker @entity21 beats @entity41 goalkeeper @entity66 last week @entity21 celebrates one of his many goals this season as the striker gets noticed in the @entity52 @entity21 will hope to be involved in @entity0 's @entity4 squad when it is announced this week @entity23 , @entity41 @entity41 vs @entity33 was billed as the battle of the two best kids on the playground yet , with teacher watching on , @entity21 overshadowed his potential @entity4 team - mate			1
but @entity79 , seemingly carrying the third - bottom team in the @entity52 , remains the fourth top goalscorer ( 15 ) , just one behind the man with better service at @entity83			0
shoot on sight , seems to be the strategy			0
@entity79 ranks first in total shots ( 61 ) and shooting accuracy ( 67 per cent ) out of the eight potential @entity4 forwards , having played more minutes ( 2,169 ) than any of the others this season			1
@entity23 ’s goals have contributed 45 per cent of @entity41 ’s points this season , and manager @entity94 reckons he and @entity21 would complement each other in a front two partnership			1
verdict : @entity65 @entity41 striker @entity23 scores against @entity34 at @entity97 earlier in march in the @entity52 @entity4 hopeful @entity79 is in contention to be selected by @entity0 when his squad is announced this week @entity16 , @entity101 @entity16 , no longer being restricted to deep midfield , was restored to an attacking role recently , and scored twice against @entity104 to show he has n’t lost his touch			1
he ’s joint - first for chance conversion ( 29 per cent ) and assists ( four ) , and @entity0 previously announced he has no intention of using him as anything other than a striker			2
was that a bluff ? @entity16 could still be used as an attacking midfielder or auxiliary forward behind two strikers , without wishing to step on @entity117 ’s toes as no 10			2
@entity16 looked comfortable up top against @entity34 on monday night , scoring @entity101 ’s only goal in a 2 - 1 defeat			1
‘ he ’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer , ’ @entity0 said in february			2
‘ it would take a lot from a 19 or 20 - year - old to replace a man up front with over 100 caps			0
’ never say never , but @entity16 surely has a place reserved , whether that be as a striker or otherwise			2
verdict : @entity65 @entity16 has become the regular face of @entity4 and is set to be selected once more by @entity0 @entity16 celebrates @entity135 's wining goal at @entity136 for @entity137 's @entity101 @entity22 , @entity138 @entity22 is just returning from a thigh and hamstring injury that cost him five months , but has the third best minutes - per - goal ratio ( 175 ) of the eight strikers			1
the fit - again @entity138 forward started against @entity143 and @entity144 , rather than @entity117 being used in the centre , as the youngster had been against @entity147 and @entity148			0
easing @entity22 back in to middle of @entity138 ’s 3 - 4 - 3 is only natural , but he should be fit enough to be used internationally this month			1
plenty are calling for @entity4 to adopt @entity151 , and we know the former @entity153 forward has no qualms in developing a partnership , as he showed with @entity156			0
@entity22 can create something from nothing , and he and the young @entity33 forward could click , if @entity0 fancies it			2
verdict : @entity65 @entity138 striker @entity22 heads his goal against @entity144 in the @entity52 at @entity162 the ball nestles in the back of the net as @entity22 continues his recovery from an injury that cost months @entity22 runs away in celebration after scoring for @entity138 as he continues his return to fitness @entity171 , @entity172 nobody can say @entity171 is n’t a workhorse			2
the only player to have featured in all 28 @entity52 games , he has an admirable 12 goals and dominated back pages when he was selected by @entity0 in november			0
yet he never made it off the substitutes ’ bench against @entity15 or @entity14 , and it led to a run of eight games without a goal for @entity172			0
he broke that duck against @entity186 with an equaliser on @entity188 , before letting his frustration out on poor , old @entity190 with four goals in a 7 - 0 humiliation in the @entity194 third round			0
@entity0 has put plenty of faith in his @entity197 previously , and could well choose to give the 21 - year - old his @entity4 debut in march			1
but the fight to be @entity0 ’s fourth striker arguably rests between @entity171 , @entity24 , @entity79 and @entity17			1
for me , the pendulum swings the way of the @entity41 striker more than the rest			0
verdict : should not go @entity172 striker @entity171 is in contention to be selected by @entity4 manager hodgson @entity171 runs away in celebration after scoring for @entity172 in the @entity52 against @entity209 @entity171 could be selected as he continues to show why he deserves a place in the @entity4 team @entity24 , @entity144 what about the chap wanted by @entity138 , both @entity215 clubs and @entity216 ? @entity24 has scored nine goals for second - bottom @entity144 – five of them in 2015 alone – and has the joint-most assists of the lot ( four )			1
@entity135 and @entity64 with plenty to prove , he ’s beating the odds week in , week out			0
perhaps it is that which convinced @entity137 to send chief scout @entity224 to @entity162 last week when @entity144 were in town			0
@entity226 fielded the first all - british @entity227 in december since 2011 , and @entity24 is among those taking his chance in a team that use similar formations to @entity4 – 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 and 4 - 4 - 2			2
@entity24 has scored four goals in seven games for the @entity231 , but a call - up can only come if he proves more worthy than his competition , and that ’s a tall ask			0
verdict : should not go ... yet @entity24 is wanted by a number of top @entity52 clubs and could be called up by @entity4 @entity24 is being looked at by @entity101 , @entity147 and @entity138 as he is likely to leave @entity144 @entity17 , @entity34 against @entity15 in november , @entity17 scored twice in the @entity8 qualifier as @entity4 won 3 - 1			1
same again ? he played as a lone striker against his former club at @entity243 , scored , and celebrated			0
@entity34 opted for 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 that night , although they tend to alter between 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 and 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 with @entity244 the preferred striker			0
but @entity17 seized the day , pouncing on @entity247 ’s suicidal back - pass and making no mistake			0
yet this season has not gone according to plan for @entity34 forward			0
he ’s ranked last for minutes per goals ( 379 ) out of the eight , as well as bringing up the rear in chance conversion ( 11 per cent )			0
does he deserve a spot more than @entity21 , @entity24 or @entity79 ? not according to the rankings			2
verdict : should not go @entity17 trains with @entity34 as the @entity52 club look to clinch @entity259 football @entity17 has had a dip in form recently but will be looking to clinch a place in the @entity4 team once more @entity18 , @entity138 @entity18 got 10 minutes against @entity14 in november , having gone to @entity264 for the @entity265 , hardly getting a look - in			1
the 33 - year - old ’s rankings tell the story better			0
in 19 appearances in the @entity52 , he ranks last for goals ( 2 ) , shots ( 12 ) , and , for a man with aerial ability , is the only one of the eight to not have scored a header			0
it would be bold to argue those with more than a decade on the @entity138 striker are less worthy to be included in @entity0 ’s squad , and it seems @entity18 ’s time has been and gone			1
the consistency of @entity21 and @entity79 , among others , has blitzed the man on the wrong side of 30 , and it ’s time for the young blood			0
verdict : should not go @entity18 has found life difficult since joining @entity138 and is unlikely to be selected by @entity0 it would be surprising if @entity18 ( pictured right with @entity291 in training ) was picked for the @entity4 team should go : @entity16 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity79 should not go : @entity17 , @entity171 , @entity24 , @entity18			1

@entity4 face @entity5 on march 27 and @entity12 in a friendly on march 31
@entity0 is likely to select four strikers in his @entity4 squad
@entity21 and @entity23 have been in fine form so far this season
captain @entity16 has played in midfield for @entity101
@entity22 has returned to *action* with @entity138 after a long *absence*
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity24 also in contention
