by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity2 drew up secret plans to train a 100,000 - strong rebel army to defeat @entity6 president @entity5			2
the ‘ shock and awe ’ strategy , drawn up by general sir @entity8 , would have seen the @entity6 force march on @entity11 with jets from the @entity13 and the @entity14 providing cover			1
but the plan was shelved two years ago after @entity18 and senior ministers deemed it too risky			1
under the extraordinary plan , members of the @entity21 would have spent a year training in @entity24 and @entity25 before marching on @entity11 the extraordinary plot , revealed by @entity27 , was considered on both sides of the @entity29 before it was dropped			1
it would have seen 100,000 @entity6 vetted and spend a year training in military combat at bases in @entity25 and @entity24			1
they would then have flooded @entity11 in an audacious attempt to bring down the @entity5 regime			0
the details of significant @entity13 involvement in the civil war are all the more surprising because last summer mr @entity18 lost a key vote in the @entity40 on even considering military action			0
lord @entity8 , who was made a peer after standing down as chief of the defence staff , thought the ambitious plan was needed to counter the might of forces loyal to @entity5			2
it reached the @entity47 in @entity48 and was also put to senior figures in @entity50 , the @entity27 reported			1
general sir @entity8 , now lord @entity51 , pushed the idea that the only way to end the bloody civil war in @entity6 was to allow president @entity5 , or take decisive action to topple him at the time it came to nothing , but just last week @entity60 president @entity59 announced a £ 300million plan to train and equip ‘ moderate ’ opposition forces in @entity6			1
mr @entity18 was left battered and bruised after mps refused to support his plan for military intervention against the use of chemical weapons			0
@entity68 was recalled for an emergency session in august last year , with @entity70 anticipating cross-party support for intervention			0
but in an extraordinary assault on mr @entity18 's authority , 39 coalition mps joined @entity76 in voting against a watered - down @entity78 motion supporting the only ‘ principle ’ of military action			0
there were shouts of ‘ resign ’ from the @entity76 benches as the result was announced to a shocked @entity85			0
@entity86 , spokesman for the @entity87 , an opposition alliance , told the @entity27 : ' the international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground			2
' a huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe			0

general sir @entity8 developed audacious strategy two years ago
100,000 fights would have spent a year training in @entity24 and @entity25
idea was *discussed* in @entity48 and @entity50 , @entity27 reports
