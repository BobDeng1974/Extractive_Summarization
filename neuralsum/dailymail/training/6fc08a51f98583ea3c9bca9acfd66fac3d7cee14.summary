by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:44 est , 1 august 2013 schools are entering weaker gcse pupils into more than one exam in the same subject to try and boost league table positions , the exams regulator revealed yesterday			1
teenagers are also being pushed into taking exams early so they can resit them to try and get a better grade			2
@entity11 said the strategy was mainly used with children expected to get a c or a d in a subject			1
a grade c or higher is classed as a good pass			2
strategy : teenagers are also being pushed into taking exams early so they can resit them to try and get a better grade ( file picture ) it claimed the tactics were designed to allow schools to cherry pick the best results to skew the league tables			1
the most startling example is in @entity33 language , where the number taking the predominantly exam - based @entity35 ( @entity35 ) has soared from 18,000 last year to 78,000 this year – more than a fourfold increase			1
however , this rise is not mirrored by a comparable drop in the number taking the standard gcse , which includes more coursework			0
this suggests pupils are sitting both the @entity35 and the @entity35 in an attempt to get a decent grade in one of them			1
as pupils await their results this month , it also emerged that 45,000 sat @entity35 maths this year , up from 34,000 last year			1
@entity11 said 15 per cent of students entered for @entity35 maths last summer – around 90,000 – had ‘ also sat one or more units from another maths gcse or taken another whole maths gcse ’			1
warning : @entity11 chief executive @entity57 said that where students are at risk of not getting a c grade , ' the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end ' in addition to this tactic , there has also been a significant increase in children taking exams before 16			1
last year , 18 per cent took maths gcse a year early			0
this year it was 23 per cent			0
' where students are at risk of not getting that precious c grade then the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end ' @entity57 , @entity11 chief executive in @entity33 language it has leapt from 7 to 10 per cent , while the numbers taking @entity33 literature and language early have increased from 8 to 11 per cent			1
@entity11 chief executive @entity57 said : ‘ this is more common for students at the @entity87			2
we are not suggesting this is happening with students of all abilities			0
‘ but where students are at risk of not getting that precious c grade then the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end			0
' in some cases we ’re seeing , in maths , that students are riding two horses and moving to a third horse – a completely different one – halfway through			0
‘ there are questions being asked about the educational value of that and the cost			0
but the reasons are quite clear			0
’ focus : sir @entity109 , the chief inspector of schools , warned in june that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the @entity87 at the expense of gifted students schools are able to ‘ bank ’ better results with the @entity118 when students sit more than one exam in the same subject , which lets them improve their standing in league tables			1
miss @entity57 warned that pupils might be demotivated by the extra pressure and said having younger students sit exams might lower overall results			2
' we will be critical of schools using early entry where we are not confident that this is allowing youngsters to achieve their full potential ' @entity134 spokesman she also hinted that results could dip in science subjects after they were toughened up			2
sir @entity109 , the chief inspector of schools , warned in june that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the @entity87 at the expense of gifted students			2
more children should be put in sets because mixed - ability classes pitched at average students had led to tens of thousands missing out on top grades , he said			0
@entity134 yesterday said it was aware of some schools using ‘ early entry ’			0
a spokesman added : ‘ as sir @entity109 has said on previous occasions , in our inspection reports we will be critical of schools using early entry where we are not confident that this is allowing youngsters to achieve their full potential			0
