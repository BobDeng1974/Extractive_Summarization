by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 18:18 est , 9 august 2013 in talks : illegal immigrants living in ' beds in sheds ' are desperate to leave @entity5 and return home , @entity7 , secretary - general of the @entity9 , has said illegal immigrants living in ‘ beds in sheds ’ are desperate to leave @entity5 and return home , an ethnic minority leader says			1
@entity13 , secretary - general of the @entity9 , said many arrivals from @entity15 who had entered the country unlawfully were stuck here , unable to work , and wanted help from the @entity19 to go back			1
his support for a ‘ voluntary returns process ’ echoes @entity19 efforts to persuade some of the estimated one million illegal immigrants in @entity5 to leave of their own accord			1
his organisation is now in talks with the department over how migrants with no right to remain might contact officials for help to return voluntarily			0
his remarks are in stark contrast to the fury provoked by the poster campaign among human rights advocates , refugee groups and left - wing politicians			1
the posters were mounted on vans driven around parts of @entity42 , and stating : ‘ in the @entity5 illegally ? go home or face arrest			1
’ a text number was provided for advice and help with travel documents			0
an investigation into whether they were ‘ offensive and irresponsible ’ was launched yesterday by the @entity51			2
the watchdog said it had received 60 complaints about the posters including that they were ‘ reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past ’			1
mr @entity13 believes the message behind the posters could have been delivered ‘ more softly ’			1
‘ if it said something like , “ if you want to go home contact this number ” or “ assistance is available to return home ” i think it would have been the same message but delivered more softly , ’ he said			1
many from the @entity70 and @entity71 were stuck here , impoverished and unable to work , he said			1
controversial : this poster campaign caused fury among human rights advocates , refugee groups and left - wing politicians ‘ their plight is well known ; they are sleeping very rough under bridges and in multiple occupancies , sometimes in sheds in the back of people ’s gardens			1
' we have been quite concerned about the abject poverty in which they are living			0
many of them have been trafficked by unscrupulous agents who take a lot of money from them			0
’ many illegal immigrants destroyed their passport once they arrived in the country , mr @entity13 said , making it difficult for them to go home even if they wanted to			1
it could take six or seven months to get replacement documents papers from the @entity15 consulate , he said			2
the @entity19 could help them obtain a new passport quickly and buy them a flight home			2
‘ our discussions have been for those who want to go back home to facilitate that process in a humane and generous way			2
’ he said illegal immigrants were victims of ‘ hype ’ which led them to believe they could live and work in @entity5 once they arrived			1
‘ in fact they are stuck			2
they want to go home on a voluntary basis and what we need is processes to facilitate that			0
’ raid : an @entity124 man who is said to have overstayed his visa was detained by @entity127 officers in a raid on a busy central @entity42 restaurant on thursday officials said the £ 10,000 cost of the poster campaign would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home because of the cost of enforced removals			1
yesterday , @entity137 became the first senior @entity138 to raise doubts about the use of the vans , and said they should be rolled - out nationwide only if it could be proved they work			0
the communities secretary said : ‘ i will be looking at that evidence			0
i need to see some very persuasive evidence that this should be passed out nationally			0
if something like this has to happen it needs to be evidence - based			0
’ the communities secretary is cracking down on traveller sites which ‘ trash ’ the countryside , with new guidance to councils on removing illegal camps			2
prepared : the @entity127 sent three vans to @entity157 to seize the employee mr @entity137 said £ 60million was being made available to local authorities to help them act more quickly to shut down unauthorised encampments			0
he told @entity163 ’s @entity162 : ‘ we inherited a situation where the number of illegal sites had gone up four-fold and what we expect them to do is obey the law like you and i do			0
‘ the idea that this is somehow an attack on the traveller community is not true			0
this is a very good deal for travellers			0
’ his department hopes the guidance will give local residents a stronger voice in getting authorities to take action against illegal camps , and prevent incidents like the £ 7million clear - out of @entity183 in 2011 after a 10 - year wrangle .			0

@entity186 said many illegal arrivals from @entity15 were stuck here
he said they were unable to work and wanted @entity19 help to go back
his remarks are in contrast to fury provoked by poster campaign
the posters stated : ‘ in the @entity5 illegally ? go home or face arrest . ’
