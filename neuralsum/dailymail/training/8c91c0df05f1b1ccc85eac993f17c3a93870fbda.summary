by @entity0 happy marriage : the actress says she has cracked the formula with @entity4 , 48 , her fifth husband with five husbands under her belt , you could say @entity8 is something of an expert on marriage			1
but given four of those relationships ended in divorce , perhaps her rules for marital bliss should be taken with a pinch of salt			2
the 80 - year - old actress has shared the secrets of her continued happiness with fifth husband @entity4 , saying they never use the same bathroom , and never interfere with each others ' lives			1
she said : ' there are rules for living with @entity8 , but i 'm sure there are rules for living with anyone			0
we 're never in the bathroom together			0
' in fact , i think it 's important to have separate bathrooms			0
he never interferes with my social calendar			0
i never interfere with his financial work			1
i occasionally give him advice on how he looks , but he 's the least vain man i 've ever known			0
' the only time he looks in the mirror is when he 's shaving			0
' miss @entity8 and theatrical manager mr @entity4 - who is 32 - years her junior - married in 2002			1
she admitted she ' was n't interested in getting married again ' at first , but changed her mind after they became close friends and insisted her current marriage is ' for good '			1
and despite her reputation as a strong - minded diva , she insisted she does not boss him around at home			1
she told the @entity52 : ' day - to - day life with him is very normal			1
despite what people may think , no , i do n't wear the trousers in our house			0
i do n't make him do the hovering or the washing - up			1
' he 's a man 's man and he likes to take charge			0
he likes to be in control			0
i suppose you could say we share the trousers ; one leg each			0
' dynasty ambitions : @entity8 planned a family with husband @entity73 , whom she met through a mutual friend ' he 'd also become quite profligate ' : the couple 's marriage was already on the rocks when their eight - year - old daughter was involved in a terrible car accident ' i was fascinated by his talent ' : @entity8 met her second husband @entity81 , pictured here with their daughter @entity83 , while he was starring in the @entity86 box - office smash @entity87 in the same interview , mr @entity4 said his wife 's romantic past never caused him to have second thoughts , despite the fact he was initially ' star struck ' by her			1
he said : ' obviously , i knew @entity8 had " baggage " - her past was out there - but you do n't marry @entity8 unless you know what you 're walking into			2
' i just wanted to make her happy			0
of course there was a lot of soul - searching about the age difference			2
co-producers : the actress was married to singer @entity105 between 1985 and 1986			1
he became her manager and co-produced two of her television mini-series with her , sins and @entity110 ' i did n't want this man around my daughter ' : @entity8 claims @entity105 turned into a fiend - angry , sulky and rude ' we knew it would impact on our lives , but we quickly came to the realisation that it only mattered in terms of the way it was perceived by other people			2
