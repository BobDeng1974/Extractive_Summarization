by @entity1 medical correspondent warning : hay fever misery is set to strike thousands more older people who were never sufferers in the past , warn experts hay fever misery is set to strike thousands more older people who were never sufferers in the past , warn experts			1
the curse of late - onset hay fever affects people in their 30s , 40s , 50s and even older who become vulnerable for the first time			1
up to 18 million @entity16 suffer hay fever , with their numbers increasing by almost one per cent a year			1
triggers such as pollution , stress and even moving home can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to hay fever whose immune systems have reached a ‘ tipping point ’			1
professor @entity29 , scientific director of the charity @entity30 , said : ‘ they have to become sensitised and more people will reach this threshold because of the interaction between pollen and traffic pollution			2
‘ the allergens change because the nitrates from traffic pollution intensify the nitrates from the pollen			0
’ prof @entity29 said late - onset hay fever was becoming more prevalent for a number of reasons			1
air pollution was a key factor , along with exposure to allergens new to the individual			0
for example , someone moving from the countryside to the city would be exposed to more pollution that ‘ charges ’ the pollen released there			0
similarly , moving from the city to rural areas exposes the individual to naturally higher pollen counts that trigger hay fever in susceptible people			2
having a more stressful job can also be a cause , she said , because it changes the immune system			0
‘ i ’ve spoken to people in their 60s who tell me it ’s the first time they ’ve had hay fever , but it ’s possible , ’ said prof @entity29			1
‘ they may have the classic profile but not previously been exposed to sufficient pollen , or other circumstances , to tip them into suffering symptoms			0
’ late - onset : triggers such as air pollution and a more stressful job can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to hay fever whose immune systems have reached a ' tipping point ' ( file picture ) she advised hay fever sufferers to start taking antihistamine now – before the grass pollen season that begins in the last week of may , which may be worse than usual this year			1
‘ it looks as though there ’s going to be smaller amounts of grass pollen around for longer , ’ said the professor			0
‘ taking precautions now will help prevent the immune system from over-reacting			0
the more sensitised people become to pollen , the more likely they are to react to lower levels			0
’ @entity106 , director of clinical services at @entity30 , said hay fever is associated with the development of asthma and urged sufferers to seek medical advice if their symptoms do not improve with medication .			2
