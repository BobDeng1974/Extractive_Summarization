in her own seat on a @entity7 jet			2
@entity8 had been found on the verge of death and while she was being treated by wildlife experts the rest of the cuckoo population set off on their annual migration			1
yesterday she was being taken first class to @entity16 so she can catch up with the rest of the flock before flying across the @entity19 and heading for the @entity20			1
high flyer : @entity8 the cuckoo , who was found close to death in @entity25 , tucks into a grub after being nursed back to health			1
she was flown plane to @entity29 , @entity16 , where she will continue her journey to the @entity20 cuckoos tend to leave @entity2 during july or early august			1
@entity8 had set off for her epic migration from @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , with four male companions but soon found herself in trouble			1
she made it only as far as @entity39 in @entity25 , where she was discovered the worse for wear in a garden , malnourished and emaciated			0
the two - year - old bird weighed only two ounces – her ideal weight is about five ounces – and was not even strong enough to carry the lightweight gps tag which ornithologists use to track birds ’ movements			1
caring : wildlife aid hospital manager , @entity48 with the box @entity8 the @entity50 travelled in she also had a badly pecked head , damaged feathers and a closed - up eye after being attacked several times by other birds			2
the cuckoo was taken to the @entity57 a few miles away in @entity58 , where she received emergency treatment and her tracker tag was removed			0
and yesterday , following a successful recovery and an appeal from the foundation for support , her journey was under way once again , with @entity7 flying her to @entity29			1
@entity68 : @entity69 is placed inside her cabin complete with inflight refreshments			0
she was flown to @entity29 on a @entity7 flight from where it is hoped she can continue her flight to the @entity20 @entity76 voyage : the little bird is hitching a lift to @entity29 in @entity16 on her way to the @entity20 she was travelling in her own seat – a business class one would have cost £ 379 if booked yesterday – and was accompanied on the flight from @entity83 by vet nurse @entity48 from @entity57			1
@entity8 was then due to spend a day recuperating before being released			0
she will cross the @entity19 and then the @entity85 desert – this time under her own wing power – reuniting with her fellow migrating cuckoos before finally arriving in the @entity20			0
a @entity57 spokesman said : ‘ we ’re excited about her journey continuing , it ’s almost like her own personal marathon with the help of @entity7			0
