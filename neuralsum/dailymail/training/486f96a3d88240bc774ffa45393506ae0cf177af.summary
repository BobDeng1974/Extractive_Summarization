a tech startup worth more than @entity1 and many other brand names might not even be real			1
high - flying @entity3 has soared 30,000 per cent to more than $ 18 a share in the last month , raising its market value to more than $ 5billion			1
@entity1 , an established brand - name airline , is worth $ 3billion			1
@entity6 is behind a social networking site called @entity8 , which markets itself as a way to meet angel investors , celebrities , business owners and more			2
off its highs : @entity15 hit more than $ 18 per share but has since fallen from that lofty perch under increased scrutiny ‘ thru [ sic ] our marketplace you may both buy and sell the ability to socially connect to individuals such as celebrities , business owners , and talented it professionals , ’ the site boasts			1
pictures of many celebrities including @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are shown as ‘ recent intros ’ on the site ’s homepage			2
it is not clear what has sent the stock literally climbing through the roof from six cents per share to more than $ 18 a share since june 16 , there are signs trouble is afoot			1
@entity6 ’s headquarters is in @entity46 , the company is incorporated in @entity48 and its only contact number is in @entity50 , @entity44 noted			2
a @entity52 call to that number was not answered and disconnected after ringing more than 20 times			0
a filing earlier this year with the @entity56 said the company would not be able to file its annual report this year			0
‘ the @entity59 is unable to file its annual report on @entity61 for the fiscal year ended december 31 , 2013 within the prescribed time without unreasonable effort or expense because the @entity59 and its accounting staff require additional time to complete the financial statements and the notes , ’ said the filing			0
the social marketplace : @entity6 promises to connect ordinary people with celebrities , tycoons and others on @entity8 - but there is little proof to suggest anything is actually done video source @entity78 a @entity52 call to the ( 800 ) number listed as the contact for @entity82 resulted in a phone company message saying the number is unassigned			1
@entity82 is listed in the filing as the ceo , cfo , @entity87 , president , secretary , @entity88 and director of cynk technology			0

the company has lost money for several quarters and has no income , according to annual income statements available on @entity100			0
bubbles come and go , but this company ’s valuation defies logic			0
it is not clear what has driven the company ’s shares to unfathomable heights – but a pump and dump scheme could be the culprit			0
pump and dumps schemes work when brokers work to sell a penny stock - at six cents per share and trading over the counter , @entity6 was a penny stock - to unsuspecting investors in order to drive the stock price up			1
straw buyers also take positions in the stock , and sell their shares at a predetermined price where they realize a huge profit			2
once they sell , the stock goes back down again and everyone else loses their shirt			2
@entity130 , known as the ' @entity131 ' went to jail for a number of crimes including pump and dump schemes			0
@entity56 policy prohibits the agency from commenting on pending investigations , and a spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the regulator is looking into the company .			0

@entity15 stock was worth six cents per share on june 16
it opened trading on *thursday* at more than $ 18 per share
the *astonishing* gain of more than 30,000 percent values it higher than @entity1 and other well - established brands
