@entity1 clubs will demand cash compensation if the @entity3 in @entity3 is moved to the winter			1
@entity5 is considering moving the tournament to avoid the fierce summer heat but @entity1 @entity10 ( @entity9 ) chairman @entity8 said the cost of moving to the winter could not be borne by the clubs			1
@entity8 , who is also chairman of @entity15 champions @entity14 , told the @entity16 in @entity18 conference in @entity19 : ' we are ready to discuss changing the date under one condition - that there is no damage for club football because if we change from summer to november or january it will affect our business			2
for the @entity3 to take place in @entity3 in 2022 , it may have to be moved to the winter due to the climate ' that cost can not be paid by the clubs			1
we are not ready to pay it and it has to be made clear to @entity5 that they need the goodwill of the clubs or we are not ready to talk or discuss it			0
' the fact is 76 per cent of all players in the last two @entity40 were contracted by @entity1 clubs			2
' @entity42 executive director @entity41 , vice-chairman of the @entity9 , said the @entity43 in 2022 should be moved to accommodate a winter @entity3			2
moving the tournament would cost clubs money , something @entity8 says can not happen he said : ' @entity47 is one of the major events in the sports landscape [ along ] with the summer olympics			0
but the @entity43 are not up there			0
' when you have such a huge event like the @entity3 do n't tell me it 's not possible to move the @entity43 a bit , especially with it still in the bid process and there are only two candidates [ @entity62 and @entity63 ]			0
' the @entity64 said it had been reassured by @entity5 president @entity65 there will be no clash with the @entity43			0
76 per cent of players at @entity69 played for @entity1 clubs , so @entity65 and @entity5 need their support			1

@entity8 says clubs must not bear cost of @entity3
the @entity3 may have to be played in winter because of the climate
but that is likely to *financially* affect @entity1 clubs
@entity14 chairman says @entity5 must be prepared to deal with that
@entity81 could be moved to accommodate @entity3
