@entity0 is being left to sweat it out as @entity3 manager following talks with the club hierarchy on wednesday			1
the @entity7 boss met with non-executive director @entity8 and @entity9 , chairman of the football board , after handing in his notice last week			1
it had been thought that a deal over the timing of @entity0 ’s departure could be produced at the meeting			1
@entity0 to stay on as @entity3 manager after talks with the club ’s board on wednesday afternoon @entity0 met with directors @entity9 ( pictured ) and @entity8 for 40 minutes however , following 40 minutes of what were described as ‘ cordial ’ discussions , it emerged that he would continue in charge for saturday ’s game against @entity27			1
‘ @entity29 ’s here and we ’re looking forward to saturday to the game , ’ said @entity28 as he left @entity7 on wednesday night			1
but the @entity34 - based businessman declined to comment on what might happen beyond the weekend or the possibility of a settlement on @entity0 ’s 12 - month notice period			1
given the relative brevity of the meeting , it seems unlikely that any serious negotiations over a financial package to accelerate his exit took place with the @entity7 boss			1
the club confirmed on monday that @entity0 had tendered his resignation and that they hoped an ‘ amicable solution ’ could be reached			1
they also revealed that his salary would revert to £ 750,000 during his notice spell after he took a 50 - per - cent wage cut earlier this year			0
as is stands , the 52 - year - old will be in the uncomfortable position of sharing the top table with club directors at what promises to be an extraordinary annual general meeting on monday			0
it remains to be seen whether his situation will change once that stormy event has passed			0
the @entity3 board hope the @entity65 will provide approval for a new share issue — possibly underwritten by @entity68 — to help plug the £ 8million funding gap they face next year			1
progress with a new financial plan may also provide the leeway required to negotiate a deal with @entity0 ( below )			1
@entity0 handed in his notice to the @entity3 board last friday but remains in charge for now meanwhile , @entity3 have revealed another financial battle after opposing an @entity79 bid to force them to pay a £ 250,000 fine the @entity7 ‘ oldco ’ received for its use of @entity83			1
in february 2013 , an independent commission headed by @entity86 handed down the punishment for use of the controversial tax scheme			0
rangers believe that punishment was only applicable to the ‘ oldco ’ — currently in the process of being liquidated by @entity94			0
however , the @entity79 insist the club is bound by the terms of the five - way agreement signed in 2012 to transfer @entity99 membership and want to withhold broadcasting revenues until the debt is settled			0
a @entity3 statement to the @entity103 read : ‘ the board of the @entity79 has determined that @entity105 is liable to pay the @entity107 fine of £ 250,000 levied on @entity108 ( previously @entity110 plc ) ( in liquidation )			2
‘ the @entity79 has also decided that this sum will be recovered from the club by the @entity79 withholding broadcasting money and other sums due to the club but which are paid in the first instance to the @entity79			0
‘ an appeal has been lodged with the judicial panel of the @entity99 which has confirmed that the decision of the @entity79 is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal subject to the @entity79 ’s right to object			0
‘ the board is advised that the sum is not due to the @entity79 and the appeal will be pursued vigorously			0
’ @entity0 will be in the dugout for @entity128 match against @entity27 on saturday the @entity79 responded by claiming senior club officials at @entity7 had previously recognised that the fine would have to be paid			1
‘ @entity105 ( “ @entity110 ” ) signed an agreement under which they would be liable for sums such as this , ’ said a statement from the governing body			0
‘ the chairman of @entity105 , @entity138 , and on one occasion the club ’s then chief executive @entity140 , engaged in individual discussions with the majority of current @entity79 board members several months ago acknowledging the liability and suggesting ways of paying the sums due			0
‘ following such discussions , it was only when no sums actually arrived from @entity3 that the @entity79 board decided to offset this liability against future sums payable to the club			2
’ it creates a second area of conflict with the authorities after the @entity99 this week issued notices of complaint against @entity3 and @entity68			2
they relate to alleged breaches of an undertaking about the @entity166 owner ’s level of influence at @entity7			2
‘ the directors of @entity3 will take legal advice with a view to defending the actions of the company and the club robustly in relation to those matters raised by the @entity99 , ’ said a club statement			2
the case will go before a hearing on january 27 but is not expected to halt @entity68 ’s plans in relation to @entity3			2
those may include underwriting a new share issue			0
it has been reported he plans to increase his stake to up to 29.9 per cent — which would give him effective control without triggering takeover rules — and that his legal team is ready to seek @entity99 approval for such a move .			0

@entity0 is still @entity3 manager following talks on wednesday
@entity0 met @entity8 and @entity9 for around 40 minutes
the @entity7 boss will be in charge for saturday *'s* match against @entity27
