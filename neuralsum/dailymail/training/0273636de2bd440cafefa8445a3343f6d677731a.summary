there are three models of @entity18 laptop			1
the basic @entity18 will be mainly distributed in @entity93 , the @entity94 and @entity95			2
@entity96 is treated with ' hydrophobic nano coating ' and can be completely submersed in water			0

@entity10 's ceo @entity119 told @entity120 : ' we 've created @entity18 after one of our business trips to our subsidiary in @entity125 , noticing severe power outages and growing demand for technology			2
' we 've looked deeper into it and saw a need for people desiring to get into education through technology but with no means – especially where there are many places with scarce access to a power grid			0
' the first countries to receive @entity18 will be @entity125 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			2

the device runs on an @entity32 processor with various cpu speeds , has a ' crystal - clear sound and display ' and has @entity55 connectivity built - in @entity10 is not the first company to build solar - power into a product			0
the @entity162 bin is currently being trialled in @entity163 and harvests energy from the @entity16 it uses this energy to compact any waste that is put into it to an eight of its size			0
the cost of leasing the high - tech bin is £ 1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity , it could save councils money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste			0
last month a @entity180 engineer launched a @entity182 campaign to launch his solar - powered @entity184 headphones			0
the solar cell on the headphone 's band has a surface area of 55cm3 with a charge capacity of approximately @entity190 and is made from poly - crystalline silicone			2
@entity192 from @entity193 is hoping to raise £ 200,000 to fund the project .			0
