crime scene : the teenager carried out the raid at a @entity6 bank in @entity15 , on friday district judge @entity16 said the child may have been influenced by something he had ‘ been watching or playing ’			1
‘ it ’s a bizarre , surreal case of a young man almost acting like a real - life action video game – nevertheless it was a robbery , ’ the judge added			2
he said the case was very unusual because the boy was a model pupil who had not been in trouble with the police			1
studies show ultra-violent games can lead to copycat behaviour among teenagers			2
@entity31 , the latest game in a notorious series , was released last week to massive controversy			2

i believe @entity73 is a very sophisticated satirical piece of work – and most kids under 18 just wo n’t get the satire			0
and if you do n’t get the satire , it ’s actually much more problematic than if you do			0
’ the @entity94 has carried out research suggesting video games are fuelling violence among primary school children			0
in the case of the young robber , @entity99 heard he was confronted by his mother after she found the cash and the fake gun in his bedroom			1

@entity109 violent : an image from the video game @entity31 the boy , whose identity is protected by law , told officers he had staked out the @entity117 bank before disguising himself in a hooded top and scarf around his face			1

@entity125 , prosecuting , said : ‘ he wanted the money because he was jealous of other people who had material things he wanted			1

he added : ‘ this is a very serious matter			0
it ’s an armed robbery but not in the conventional sense most people would recognise			0
you knew with hindsight it was an imitation firearm but the tellers clearly did n’t know that and handed over cash in fear of being shot			2
’ the judge made no mention of any specific video games			0
he granted the teenager conditional bail until he is sentenced on october 15 .			2
