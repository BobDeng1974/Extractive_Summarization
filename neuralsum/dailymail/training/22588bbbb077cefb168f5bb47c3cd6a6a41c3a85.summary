outspoken : father @entity0 said the 15 - year - old was kidnapped for @entity3 sex parties the @entity5 's leading exorcist priest has sensationally claimed a missing schoolgirl thought to be buried in a murdered gangster 's tomb was kidnapped for @entity3 sex parties			1
father @entity0 , 85 , who has carried out 70,000 exorcisms , spoke out as investigators continued to examine mobster @entity12 's tomb in their hunt for @entity14			1
last week police and forensic experts broke into the grave after an anonymous phone call to a tv show said the truth about @entity22 's 1983 disappearance would be ' found there '			1
and although bones not belonging to the mobster were recovered they have not yet been positively identified as hers			0
however @entity0 , in an interview with @entity30 newspaper , said : ' this was a crime with a sexual motive			2
' it has already previously been stated by ( deceased ) monsignor @entity35 , an archivist at the @entity3 , who was asked to recruit girls for parties with the help of the @entity3 gendarmes			0
' i believe @entity22 ended up in this circle			0
i have never believed in the international theory ( overseas kidnappers )			0
i have motives to believe that this was just a case of sexual exploitation			0
' it led to the murder and then the hiding of her body			0
also involved are diplomatic staff from a foreign embassy to the @entity3			0
' today there was no immediate response from the @entity3 to @entity0 's claims			1
but @entity3 officials insisted they had always co-operated with the investigation into @entity60 's disappearance - a claim that her brother has often disputed			2
mobster : @entity12 ( left ) is believed to have been linked to the kidnapping and murder of @entity14 ( right ) , who disappeared aged 15 in 1983 father @entity0 is a colourful figure who in the past has also denounced yoga and @entity71 as the ' work of the @entity73 '			1
he was appointed by the @entity74 as the @entity3 's chief exorcist			0
it is not the first time @entity0 has raised eyebrows with his forthright views - two years ago he said sex scandals rocking the @entity5 were evidence ' the @entity73 was at work in the @entity3			1
' in 2006 , @entity0 , who was ordained a priest in 1954 , gave an interview to @entity85 in which he said @entity87 leader @entity86 and @entity89 dictator @entity88 were possessed by the @entity73			1
according to secret @entity3 documents recently released the then wartime pope @entity90 attempted a ' long distance exorcism ' of @entity86 but it failed to have any effect			0
claims : the 15 - year - old was kidnapped for @entity3 sex parties , it has been claimed @entity98 mobster @entity12 , leader of a murderous gang known as the @entity100 , was gunned down aged just 38 , by members of his outfit after they fell out			1
detectives investigating the disappearance of @entity14 , 15 , in 1983 , believe @entity12 is linked to her kidnap and the body of the @entity3 employee 's daughter has never been found			1
last month the diocese of @entity111 , on orders from the @entity3 , granted investigators permission to open up the tomb in the @entity117 basilica close to @entity118 in the centre of @entity111			1
at the time of his funeral there were raised eyebrows when despite his criminal past church chiefs allowed @entity12 to be buried in the crypt of @entity117			2
at the time it was said the burial was given the go ahead because prison chaplain @entity130 told bishops that @entity12 had ' repented while in jail and also done a lot of work for charity , ' including large donations to the @entity5			2
a burial service truck enters the courtyard of @entity140 ' @entity139 , in @entity111 , before the tomb of mobster @entity12 was opened police officers stand outside @entity140 ' @entity139 , in @entity111 , as a priest leaves @entity12 , whose name on the £ 12,000 tomb is spelt in diamonds , was buried in @entity117 church after he was gunned down in 1990 in the city 's famous @entity148			1
he and his gang controlled the lucrative drug market in @entity111 and were also rumoured to have a ' free hand ' because of their links with police and @entity157 secret service agents			2
the disappearance of @entity159 reads like the roller coaster plot of a @entity163 @entity162 thriller with a touch of @entity165 thrown in for good measure			0
twelve years ago a skull was found in the confessional box of a @entity111 church and tests were carried out on it to see if it was @entity60 after a mystery tip off but they proved negative			1
in 2008 @entity175 , @entity12 girlfriend at the time of @entity60 's disappearance , sensationally claimed that now dead @entity178 monsignor @entity177 , the controversial chief of the @entity3 bank , was behind the kidnap			2
forensic police unload equipment in the courtyard of @entity140 ' @entity139 , in @entity111 monsignor @entity177 used his status to avoid being questioned by police in the early 1980 's probing the collapse of a @entity188 which the @entity3 had invested heavily in			2
the collapse was linked to the murder of @entity191 dubbed @entity191 because of the @entity3 links and his body was found hanging under @entity194 in @entity195 in june 1982			0
his pockets filled with cash and stones and it was originally recorded as a suicide but police believe he was murdered by the @entity202 after a bungled money laundering operation			0
at the same time as @entity175 made her claim a mystery caller to a missing person ’s programme on @entity157 tv said the riddle of @entity159 ’s kidnap would be solved ' if @entity12 tomb was opened '			1
following @entity175 claims the @entity3 took the unusual step of speaking publicly and dismissed her claims about @entity178 monsignor @entity177 , who died in @entity213 four years ago			0
missing person : @entity215 , @entity22 's brother said it was time for the @entity3 to come clean about what it knows of @entity22 's disappearance			0

father @entity0 , 85 , has carried out more than 70,000 exorcisms
previously said yoga and @entity71 are ' the work of the @entity73 '
@entity14 , 15 , went missing in @entity111 in 1983
