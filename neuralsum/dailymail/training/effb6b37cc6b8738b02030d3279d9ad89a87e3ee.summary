@entity1 's players have plenty of reasons to smile after their 4 - 1 win against @entity5 on wednesday night but they were in far more sombre mood ahead of kick - off at the @entity8			1
in another of their popular @entity13 videos , the club 's media department challenged six of @entity16 's first - team to avoid laughing during funny @entity18 clips @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 agreed to take part , with mixed results to say the least			1
@entity1 defender @entity20 was one of six players to take part in the @entity18 challenge striker @entity24 struggles to compose himself before being shown four funny videos summer signing @entity21 also showed his sense of humour by taking part in the festive video @entity1 's stars took turns to sit in front of a laptop and watch a quartet of hilarious clips posted on the internet 's most popular video - sharing site			1
@entity24 did n't get off to a good start , finding it difficult to compose himself before the play button had even been clicked			2
and the @entity48 striker did n't last much longer , eventually letting out a giggle towards the end of the first baby - themed clip as @entity20 also bowed out early on in the competition			0
the second video , a clip showing a baby chuckling at sheets of paper being torn , failed to claim any victims but the straight faces did n't last long			0
@entity61 defender @entity20 ca n't stop himself from laughing at a clip of a baby pulling a stern face @entity23 eventually cracked up when shown a video of a man hurling himself into a wall another hilarious baby clip meant @entity69 midfielder @entity19 bowed out at the final video @entity23 could n't stop himself laughing at a man inexplicably launching himself into a wall , while @entity19 and @entity21 cracked when shown a baby attempting a @entity75 impression			0
that left @entity22 , famed for his hard exterior after his not - so - festive rendition of @entity79 two years ago , as the winner			0
after being informed that he 'd completed the challenge and that the clips were the best @entity1 's media team could find , the defender responded : ' this one ? not for me			1
where is my present ? ' that could well be the easiest victory a @entity1 player has this season			2
@entity22 was left unimpressed with the videos and easily stopped himself from laughing			0
