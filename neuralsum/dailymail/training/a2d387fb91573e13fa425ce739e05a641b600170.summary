by @entity1 reporter a website has been ordered to remove a claim that the @entity5 jab could cause autism in children by the @entity8			2
the children ’s immunisation service , babyjabs.co.uk , claimed experts believe the vaccine ' could be causing autism in up to 10 % of autistic children in the @entity14 '			2
it also said : ' most experts now agree that the large rise ( in autism ) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis , but also by a real increase in the number of children with autism			0
' the babyjabs website says it enables parents to make an ' informed choice ' about child vaccinations it added that parental fears the jab caused autism were ' supported ' by the fact that the the vaccine strain measles had been found in the guts and brains of some autistic children			1
however , the @entity8 said both the @entity35 and the @entity36 have found no evidence of a causal link between @entity5 and autism			1
the @entity8 ruled : ' consumers were likely to infer from the claim , that the ‘ real increase in the number of children with autism ’ was not just down to increased diagnosis , but the vaccine might have played a role in bringing about that increase			0
' they added : ' because we had not seen supporting evidence that that was the case , and understood that that position was also contradicted by general medical opinion , we concluded that the claim was misleading			0
' @entity51 denied a breach citing previous scientific research which had concluded : ' we can not rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated '			0
but the @entity8 said : ' the @entity58 , looking at the general evidence available , could find no significant association between @entity5 immunisation and autism			1
' we noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism , but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the @entity5 vaccine			1
' they added : ' we considered that consumers would understand from the ( advert ) that the @entity5 vaccine was likely to have caused autism in up to 10 % of autistic children in the @entity14 , namely between 300 and 400 children a year			0
' we noted we had not seen any evidence , such as a clinical trial or study , which actively showed that the @entity5 vaccine was likely to cause autism in between 300 and 400 children a year			1
' because we did not consider that we had seen sufficient evidence to support the claim we concluded it was misleading			0

the @entity35 and the @entity36 have found no evidence of a causal link between *mmr* and autism
