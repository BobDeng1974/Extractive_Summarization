gentler : the treatment uses a hormone which is naturally produced in the body and therefore believed to be gentler on the body than the current @entity6 drug women desperate to become mothers could soon benefit from a kinder , safer form of @entity6 based on a ‘ chocolate hormone ’			1
doctors at @entity12 are perfecting a treatment that capitalises on the body ’s own way of ripening eggs			1
they report that 12 babies have been born so far			2
this should spare patients pain and discomfort – and also cut the odds of potentially life - threatening complications			2
the new treatment uses a hormone called kisspeptin , which is naturally made in the body			1
it was discovered in the mid- 1990s by researchers in @entity30 , @entity31 , and is named after @entity30 ’s @entity32			1
@entity33 is thought to trigger the ripening of eggs during normal pregnancies and so should be gentler on the body than human chorionic gonadotropin , a drug used in @entity6 at the moment			1
it is also broken down more quickly , which should also cut the risk of problems			0
some 53 @entity6 patients were given the ‘ chocolate hormone ’ in the study and 12 babies were born			2
none of the women suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( @entity51 ) which can cause nausea , vomiting and bloating			0
three had ectopic pregnancies – a potentially fatal complication in which the embryo implants outside the womb – but that may have been a statistical blip , the @entity55 reports			0
one of the babies is @entity64 , whose doctors described the treatment as very promising			0
@entity68 ’s mother , @entity67 , 31 , of @entity69 , had experienced the discomfort of mild @entity51 earlier			0
she said : ‘ i went through several cycles of @entity6 previously but the one in the trial was the least uncomfortable – it was less painful and i felt less swollen			2
’ the hormone - kisspeptin - was discovered in @entity30 , @entity31 , and named after @entity30 's kisses research professor @entity77 said : ‘ our study has shown that kisspeptin can be used as a trigger for egg maturation in @entity6 therapy			1
‘ it ’s been a joy to see 12 healthy babies born using this approach			0
’ some doctors said the trial was too small to be meaningful but dr @entity90 , a former chairman of the @entity91 , said the births are ‘ very exciting ’ .			0

found in @entity30 , @entity31 , named after @entity30 's @entity32
