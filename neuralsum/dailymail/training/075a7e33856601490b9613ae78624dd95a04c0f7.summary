@entity19 and the unidentified young woman spent their time together involved listening to music and smoking pot , though she says she ended things when he wanted to move faster than she did though she does n't consider that as an indication that he was bound to be a killer			1
college friends : the first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with @entity19 at @entity16 and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact ' i do n't think that 's necessarily being a terrorist			1

@entity23 ' knew when he saw the empty fireworks that @entity19 was involved in the @entity131 bombing			1
@entity24 was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed , meaning that @entity19 could have either used the explosives or planned to use them			2
