@entity0 has stepped down as @entity2 leader with a prediction that his successor , @entity4 , will ' make history ' and secure independence for @entity7			1
the outgoing first minister made the forecast as he addressed the @entity2 annual conference in @entity11 shortly after ms @entity4 took over the reins as head of the party			1
ms @entity4 will use her keynote speech today to suggest that her party will prop up a @entity18 government after the next general election			1

@entity0 ( right ) has stepped down as @entity2 leader with a prediction that his successor , @entity4 ( left ) , will ' make history ' and secure independence for @entity7 with a hung parliament being one possible outcome in may 's general election , ms @entity4 said the nationalists - who have seen their support rise since the independence referendum - could hold the balance of power in the @entity36 parliament			1
as she makes her first speech as party leader at the @entity2 annual conference in @entity11 , she will say : ' the @entity2 will never put the @entity39 into government			1
' in the general election , @entity18 will ' fall back on the same desperate mantras as before ' and tell voters north of the border the only way to keep the conservatives out of @entity47 is to back @entity49 's party			2
but she will claim that is ' the biggest con trick in @entity7 politics ' and say voters must ' not fall for it again '			0
ms @entity4 will recall : ' @entity7 did vote @entity18 at the last general election , but we still ended up with the @entity39			1
' and if the people of @entity61 vote @entity39 next may , it wo n't matter how we vote , a @entity39 government is what we 'll get			0
or worse a @entity39 / @entity64 government			0
' if that happens , she will say @entity7 will need ' strong @entity67 who will stand up to the @entity39 , challenge the despicable politics of @entity69 and fight @entity7 's corner '			2
she will add : ' perhaps this time @entity7 's votes will count			2
@entity7 could well hold the balance of power in a @entity24 parliament with no overall majority			2
' ms @entity4 will vow : ' if that happens , i promise you this - you wo n't need to have voted @entity18 to keep the @entity39 out , because that 's what we 'll do			2
the outgoing first minister made the forecast as he addressed the @entity2 annual conference in @entity11 shortly after ms @entity4 took over the reins as head of the party ' my pledge to @entity7 today is this - the @entity2 will never put the @entity39 into government			1
' mr @entity0 announced that he would be resigning as both @entity2 leader and first minister within hours of the referendum defeat in september			1
@entity7 has now ' changed utterly ' as a result of that vote , he said			0
he hailed ms @entity4 - who will be @entity7 's first female first minister - as a ' woman of extraordinary talent '			1
her mother , @entity95 , could be seen wiping away tears as she sat in the audience			2
mr @entity0 told his successor : ' @entity4 , your contribution to where this party now stands has already been immense			1
' your future contribution - i have no doubt - will be to make history			0
' he told the conference the ' dream ' of independence was ' alive and well and will succeed '			0
mr @entity0 said that in the referendum - in which the @entity112 campaign secured 45 % of the vote - @entity7 had risen to ' the challenge of change '			1
he said : ' the people will not disappear back into the political shadows and the nation will not fade into the dark			0
this country has changed and changed utterly			0
' that is the change which will carry us forward - forward to independence			0
' @entity95 , @entity4 's mother , could be seen wiping away tears as she sat in the audience while a majority of voters did not back independence in the referendum , mr @entity0 said he knew ' with a greater certainty than ever before ' that the country would one day leave the @entity36			1
' at various times in our national story , @entity7 has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory , ' he said			0
' this time , out of defeat will come future success			0
' he insisted that september 18 would in future ' come to be seen as the day @entity7 started to take control of our own destiny '			0
he said that many no voters had been won over by the vow of substantial new powers made by @entity22 , @entity49 and @entity150 in their ' last - minute promise of radical constitutional reform within the union '			0
mr @entity0 told @entity2 activists : ' be in no doubt - without that last - gasp concession , the no campaign would have had its just deserts			1
' he went on to warn the leaders of the @entity36 parties : ' if the @entity24 gang reneges on that promise made in the campaign , they will discover that hell hath no fury like this nation scorned			0
' former @entity18 prime minister @entity167 promised ' home rule ' for @entity7 when he made a ' brief cameo appearance as leader of @entity171 ' - the cross-party campaign for the union			2
ms @entity4 will formally replace @entity0 as first minister next week after a vote in @entity176 while mr @entity0 said both the conservatives and @entity18 would try to renege on the commitment , he stressed that ' @entity7 expects the vow to be redeemed '			1
despite the referendum result , he said the @entity2 was ' invigorated as never before ' as he set his party the challenge of winning a majority of @entity7 seats at @entity24 for the first time in next may 's general election , and amassing 100,000 members by then			1
' we have never been an ordinary political party , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' now we are an extraordinary political party with a great task to be completed			0
' while the @entity2 had 25,000 members at the time of the referendum , that membership has now swelled to more than 85,000			0
setting the target of increasing that further , mr @entity0 said : ' let us ensure that by next may 's election the @entity2 reaches a level which has never been seen before in any political party in the history of @entity7 politics - 100,000 members to argue for the national cause			1
' he also said the nationalists should set out to win ' our first @entity36 general election in @entity7 ' in less than six months ' time			0
to help achieve that , he said the party should be ' open and generous ' , and allow ' some shining stars of the @entity112 movement to stand under the @entity2 banner ' .			0
