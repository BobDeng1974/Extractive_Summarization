this weekend we saw three of the best penalty takers in the country in action			1
@entity4 and @entity5 both scored at the @entity7 and @entity6 scored another two on sunday to make it 10 in the league			1
@entity4 has now scored six times from the spot in 2013 - 14 while @entity5 continued his phenomenal record			1
since arriving at @entity13 he has scored 34 out of 34 penalties			1
composed : always handy from 12 yards , @entity6 now has 10 goals from the spot this term cool : @entity4 has six from the spot this season , and scored the opener against @entity13 i spoke to @entity4 last week and asked him about his own impressive record this season			1
he never used to be a set - piece specialist but now he is scoring them for fun			1
he told me the most important thing for a penalty taker is to stay calm , and there are few calmer players from 12 yards than @entity4			1
@entity31 was also in the @entity33 studio with me on saturday and when i asked if the @entity34 practice penalties , he laughed and said : ‘ what for ? for you @entity38 it is all in your heads			1
’ he is spot on			1
there is no way you can recreate the atmosphere and exhaustion of an international game after 120 minutes			1
@entity6 will be at the @entity47 in great form from the spot and @entity5 ’s record might give him an edge for selection			2
let ’s hope they keep it up			2
precision : @entity5 has scored 34 of his 34 penalties taken for @entity13 all in your head : former @entity60 captain @entity31 says there 's no need to practise penalty taking no luck : @entity65 have lost out in a penalty shoot - out in six of their last 10 major tournaments blues are flying that was exactly the kind of @entity71 will have wanted			1
@entity72 has @entity73 playing exceptional football and he really has taken them to another level			1
i said last week that @entity77 is my manager of the year , but @entity72 is not far behind			1
his team swept past @entity79 with such pace that they reminded me of the @entity79 teams of old			2
@entity83 ’s side have conceded 20 goals now away to the top four , which shows you where they are going wrong			2
double trouble : @entity88 and @entity89 scored @entity73 's opening two goals against @entity79 that 's good son : fired up boss @entity72 and the @entity94 front man share the moment wanting : @entity79 players wait for play to restart after the second goal in the 3 - 0 domination by @entity73 @entity99 it was a good result for the red half of @entity102 , too			1
so much is said about @entity104 ’s attacking players but i was really impressed by @entity106 and @entity107 against @entity108			1
skrtel in particular has been excellent this season			2
there were doubts that he may not feature much but he has been essential to their success			2
he did a great job on @entity116 and he needs to do the same next week against @entity118 ’s fearsome strike force			2
the back : @entity106 ( second left ) and @entity107 ( far left ) put in an impressive performance against @entity108 pleased as @entity121 when @entity121 missed a penalty against @entity124 in january , it was the kind of miss that would have affected a lot of players			1
but , as our table shows , his performances since then have been the perfect response			2
he scored twice on saturday , including a magnificent curling effort			2
he ’s been at many clubs throughout his career but he might just have found a home at @entity136			1
i am all ears : @entity136 's @entity121 celebrates after scoring his second goal against @entity140 i wondered if he would be a @entity142 type of player , but he has been crucial in the past few weeks			1
he has a great left foot and is showing what he can do			2
@entity136 were magnificent against @entity140 and in such a vital game , too			1
there was always a question over whether they could follow up the win over @entity94 but they put in a fine display and @entity121 was at the heart of it			1
high , wide , handsome : @entity121 has bounced back from his dismal penalty miss against @entity124 in january all change : @entity121 before and after penalty miss at @entity124 in january @entity158 finally pull the trigger it 's a big call for @entity158 to sack @entity161 , but chief executive @entity162 has had his list of replacements ready for a while			1
the club ’s @entity167 coach @entity166 has been put in charge but he has been thrown a grenade			2
these are his first five matches : @entity174 ( a ) , @entity104 ( @entity173 ) , @entity172 ( a ) , @entity94 ( a ) , @entity79 ( @entity173 )			1
the @entity174 game will be vital			2
four weeks ago @entity177 ’s side looked doomed but the weekend results have given them hope			0
the turmoil at @entity158 could help them and their great escape might just be on			0
heading down ? @entity158 are on the edge of the relegation zone and have decided to sack @entity161 remainder : youth coach @entity166 has taken charge , but @entity158 have not said if he is a permanent replacement a shame for @entity190 though @entity5 might be on his way to @entity193 it was sad to see his @entity13 team - mate @entity194 pick up what looks like a serious injury			0
he has had a fantastic season and though there was no guarantee he ’d get picked for the @entity47 , he would have been unlucky to miss out			0
i missed a @entity47 and @entity201 through injury – it breaks your heart in two			0
he just has to remember the season he has had , take positives from that and get fit again			0
he is still young so i ’m sure his chance will come			0
in tatters : @entity194 's suffered a serious - looking knee injury against @entity118 @entity210 back on the up congratulations to @entity210 on their promotion			0
it ’s been 10 years since they were in the top flight but @entity216 has done a great job and they thoroughly deserve to be back there			0
i expect @entity221 to follow them soon and then it will be a real battle for the final place in the play - offs			0
victory selfie : the @entity210 players show their joy after learning that they had been promoted 38 - @entity177 has been keen to make the most of his squad since taking charge of @entity174			0
the @entity34 made three changes to the team that lost to @entity73 , including a second debut for @entity235 in his second spell at the club			1
@entity235 became the 38th player to be used by @entity174 this season , a record for the @entity241			0
49 - @entity242 ( below ) continued to tinker with his @entity172 team			0
he made eight changes for the @entity246 match and has now used a unique starting xi in 49 games			0
6 - @entity249 set up another goal on saturday			0
the @entity251 ( right ) has made six assists this season , more than any other defender in the league			0
1973 - @entity174 grabbed a vital three points at @entity257 but they had not won a league match at @entity259 since march 1973			0
that year they won 3 - 2 in the old @entity260			0
0.62 - @entity140 are in trouble			0
under @entity263 they averaged 0.9 points per game but with @entity266 ( below ) they average just 0.62			0
2 - @entity267 now has two goals in two games at @entity270			0
he has scored as many goals for @entity94 at the ground as he has against them – he also scored two for @entity274 in the @entity275			0
6 - prior to defeat against @entity276 , @entity158 were unbeaten in six games at @entity278 , winning three and drawing three			0
but @entity276 ’s fourth league win in five games at the ground has plunged @entity158 right back into the relegation battle .			0

@entity4 and @entity31 agree the key to penalties is to stay calm
@entity72 has taken @entity73 to another level
@entity106 and @entity107 shone for @entity104
*journeyman* @entity121 has found a home at @entity136
