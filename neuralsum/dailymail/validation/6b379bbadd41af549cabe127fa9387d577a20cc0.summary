@entity1 manager @entity0 believes the only way is up for @entity3 as the two coaching course mates prepare to cross tactical swords at @entity6			1
@entity7 and new @entity8 boss @entity3 got to know each other on the same @entity11 coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on saturday with three @entity14 points at stake			1
@entity3 got his break in management at @entity18 first - a position he was unlucky to lose according to @entity7 - and the former @entity21 midfielder has revived @entity8 's fortunes with three successive wins taking them away from the @entity14 danger zone and into the semi-final of the @entity27			2
@entity8 manager @entity3 is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate @entity0 @entity3 has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the @entity6 managerial hot - seat ' he 's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group , ' @entity0 said at his pre-match press conference			1
' you need results to do that but they 've got very good players there who obviously were n't playing to their full potential before @entity3 took over			2
' but he 's had an instant impact			0
he 's a very honest guy , black and white , and that comes across in his interviews and the way he approaches the game			0
@entity0 believes himself and @entity3 are very much their own men despite their similarities ' they 're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us			1
' we 've got our own agenda , we want to achieve our best total of 47 points , and i think you 've seen our attitude and focus in our recent games against @entity18 and @entity63			0
' the actual performances deserved more than they got and we need to make sure we replicate that to get the points at @entity8			0
' the pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright , young @entity69 managers , even if the 46 - year - old @entity3 is actually 10 years older than @entity0 who celebrated his first anniversary as @entity1 boss last month			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 observes his players during the training session at the @entity75 but @entity0 says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences			1
' when @entity3 came in at @entity18 he was already within the club at that time , albeit within a different coaching role , ' @entity0 said			1
' i came from a playing background into it and i would n't say we were similar managers with the same approach or anything like that			0
' but we 've got the same desire , commitment and principles and are clear in what we want			0
' i 'm on the same coaching course as @entity3 and his views on football are very interesting			2
@entity0 believes the former @entity18 boss will certainly take @entity8 forward in the future ' he 's had a fantastic start and i am sure he will take @entity8 forward after being unlucky at @entity18			1
' he has been given his chance and taken the opportunity really well , he has got them going			0
' @entity1 are seeking to recover from back - to - back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at @entity6 in the shape of @entity105			1
the 25 - year - old 's career nose - dived after his Â£ 6.2million move from @entity1 to @entity112 in august 2012 , @entity105 starting only two league games at the @entity107 before joining @entity8 on loan in january			2
@entity105 will come up against his former @entity1 teammates during the game at @entity6 but @entity105 has thrived under @entity3 with three goals in five games and @entity0 admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career			1
' @entity121 has been searching for regular football and it is good to see him playing , ' @entity0 said			2
' he did tremendously well for us and we will never forget what he did here			0
' it is no surprise to see him playing regular football in the @entity14 because he 's got the talent to do that			0
' @entity105 has thrived since arriving at @entity8 following an unproductive spell with @entity112			0

@entity1 manager @entity0 believes @entity3 has a big future
@entity134 met doing the same fa of @entity11 coaching course
on *sunday* the course friends do battle with each other at @entity6
@entity0 admits both are very much their own men despite their similarities
