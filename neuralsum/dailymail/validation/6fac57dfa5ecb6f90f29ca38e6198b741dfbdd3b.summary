a push for answers on how a @entity3 police officer avoided criminal charges in the videotaped chokehold death of @entity6 has stalled because it does not protect grand jury secrecy			1
@entity9 justice @entity8 ruled on thursday that the grand jury record would remain under seal			1
he rejected arguments by the @entity13 and others that the public had a right to know why jurors refused to indict the officer in spite of the video			0
he wrote that the law required the plaintiffs to establish a ' compelling and particularized need ' to release the grand jury minutes			1
testimony from the grand jury than did not indict the police officer involved in the death of @entity6 ( right , with family ) will remain sealed after a decision from @entity9 justice @entity8 mr @entity6 was seen saying ' i ca n't breathe ' after being taken to a ground by a policeman on @entity3 's @entity35 borough the @entity35 judge 's ruling cited a handful of rare instances where @entity3 courts authorized disclosure , but only to specific parties for specific reasons — not out of the public interest			1
for example , a 2012 appeals court ruling authorized release of bank records from a grand jury proceeding to someone seeking a civil judgment against the @entity52			1
another ruling in 1978 turned over witness statements to state police for disciplinary proceedings			0
a 2001 decision even gave the son of a defendant in a decades - old murder case access to grand jury minutes to use for a movie script			1
at a hearing in february , @entity8 had asked over and over how the @entity6 grand jury minutes would be used			1
' the only answer which the court heard was the possibility of effecting legislative change , ' he wrote			0
however , he said that hopes of legal efforts to combat police brutality or ' journalistic curiousity ' were not strong enough to unseal the documents			0
' that proffered need is purely speculative and does not satisfy the requirements of the law			0
' the death of mr @entity6 ( left poster ) and @entity79 ( right poster ) and the subsequent non-indictment of the police officers involved in their deaths sparked a series of protests			1
justice @entity8 wrote that none of the plaintiffs seeking to unveil the grand jury testimony showed a ' compelling and particularized need ' for the information the effort to make the @entity6 grand jury record public had been considered a longshot			1
but the decision comes amid an ongoing debate over whether the laws need revisions promoting more transparency , particularly when it involves police shootings			0
by preserving secrecy in the @entity6 case , the court ' has reinforced the distrust many @entity3 already feel toward the performance of the criminal justice system in this case , ' said @entity13 legal director @entity108			1
officer @entity109 and other officers had stopped mr @entity6 on suspicion of selling loose , untaxed cigarettes last july			2
a video shot by an onlooker shows mr @entity6 telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed			2
@entity114 responded by wrapping his arm around mr @entity6 's neck in what he said was a sanctioned takedown move and not a banned chokehold			2
the heavyset @entity6 , who had asthma , is heard on the tape gasping , ' i ca n't breathe			2
' he loses consciousness and died at a hospital			0
the @entity13 and others had asked the court to order @entity35 district attorney @entity127 to release the grand jury transcript , including the testimony of @entity114 , and dozens of witnesses , detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation			1
a lawyer for mr @entity6 's family said that the secrecy of grand juries was an ' anachronism			1
' above , his daughter @entity139 leads a demonstration in september , when the grand jury decision was announced a similar step was voluntarily taken by the prosecutor in @entity144 , @entity145 , when a grand jury there refused to indict an officer in the fatal police shooting of 18 - year - old @entity79			1
both mr @entity6 and mr @entity79 were black ; the officers involved are white			2
the deaths sparked nationwide protests about the treatment of communities of color by law enforcement and a debate about the role of race in policing			0
@entity127 argued that the disclosure would damage the credibility of prosecutors seeking to assure both grand jurors and witnesses that details of their participation would be kept from public view			0
the judge agreed that the argument ' is particularly cogent in ' high publicity cases ' where the witnesses ' truthful and accurate testimony is vital			0
' @entity8 wrote : ' it is in such notorious cases that witnesses ' cooperation and honesty should be encouraged — not discouraged — for fear of disclosure			0
' ' if every newsworthy case were deemed compelling and , thus justified disclosure , the veil of grand jury secrecy would be lifted and every citizen 's right to have fellow citizens , sitting on a grand jury , check the power of the police and the prosecutor without pressure from outside influences — real or perceived — would be imperiled , ' the justice said			1
justice @entity8 said that secrecy is especially vital in ' high publicity cases '			0
above , a memorial to mr @entity6 on @entity35 the decision by the @entity35 grand jurors , he added , ' was theirs alone , after having heard all of the evidence , having been instructed on law and having deliberated			2
' their collective decision should not be impeached by the unbridled speculation that the integrity of this grand jury was impaired in any way			1
' @entity210 , who represents @entity6 's family , called the ruling misguided			2
' we think this grand jury process was deeply flawed , ' he said			1
' secret grand juries are an anachronism , ' he added , according to the @entity217			0
' the judge has essentially sanctioned the use of a secret trial for a very public matter			0
if this was a normal grand jury process , they would have had an indictment in five minutes , ' he said			2
mr @entity127 said thursday his office would respect ' and will adhere to judge @entity8 's well - reasoned decision			0
' the parties , which also include the @entity228 , the @entity230 's office , @entity231 and the @entity232 , are appealing			0
parties in the case are appealing the decision of @entity236 , though the application itself was considered a longshot			0

@entity3 justice said request did n't show ' particularized need ' for info
testimony had *previously* been given to help someone with movie script
prosecutor in @entity144 police shooting unveiled testimony voluntarily
