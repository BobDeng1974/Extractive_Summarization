cancer survival rates in @entity3 are lagging behind other developed countries because not enough patients get crucial tests which could diagnose the disease early , the chief inspector of hospitals said yesterday			1
professor sir @entity8 revealed @entity3 performs nearly half as many colonoscopies - a test for bowel cancer - as @entity12			1
@entity13 and @entity14 , two of the best performing countries internationally for colorectal cancers , give the test to around three times as many patients per 1,000 people as @entity3			1
poor survival rates could be down to the low numbers of testing for cancer among patients in the @entity27 , a leading doctor said ( file image ) sir @entity8 , the government ’s former national cancer director , said @entity32 performed the fewest tests per head in the @entity27 , while the @entity35 was the worst area in @entity3 and the @entity37 the best			1
@entity39 patients were 50 per cent more likely on average to receive the test than the @entity3 , but he described this as ‘ not something to be terribly proud of ’ as it still performed slightly fewer than @entity12			1
speaking at the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) conference in @entity47 , he said : ‘ one of the reasons ( the @entity27 has lower survival rates than other developed countries ) probably is that we do n’t do enough diagnostics			2
‘ there may be overuse of diagnostics in some of these countries , but it ’s important we benchmark ourselves to see where we are			0
’ he added : ‘ i would say the @entity27 woke up late to the problem of cancer			1
good progress has been made , particularly since 2000 , but we are still not achieving outcomes comparable with the best countries and , if you want to put that even more simply : could do better			0
’ sir @entity8 cited the differences in care standards across @entity68 and named @entity69 in @entity70 which was rated poor in most areas when assessed @entity27 needs ‘ better cancer prevention , better earlier diagnosis and more testing of the general public ’ , he said			1
but problems with getting tests for early diagnosis were not due to ‘ a lack of will ’ on the part of @entity81 but linked to funding restraints			2
sir @entity8 also said the @entity83 had discovered ‘ huge variation ’ between standards of care in hospitals			0
he gave the example of @entity89 , in @entity70 , which was rated good or outstanding on almost every assessment area , and @entity69 , just 24 miles away , which was rated poor or needing improvement in most areas			0
but he implied patients should not complain about having to travel to get the best treatment			0
he told the conference that if he had cancer he ‘ would want to be treated close to home and at my convenience , but i would n’t want that to the exclusion of getting the best treatment ’			0
he added : ‘ it always amazes me that people are prepared to fly 1,000 miles for a better chance of sunshine on a summer holiday , but they seem to think it ’s to far to go , to go 50 miles to get the best cancer treatment ... i would travel if i had to			2
’ survival rate ‎ s for colorectal cancer in the @entity27 improved from 70 per cent of patients living for at least one year to just under 75 per cent between 1995 and 2007 , according to the @entity112			1
in contrast , the same figures showed ‎ survival rates in @entity13 were 85 per cent and were 83 per cent in @entity14			1
nearly half of patients diagnosed with lung cancer on emergency admission to hospital had been put off going to see their gp , a study presented at the conference found			2
reasons included difficulty making an appointment , being unable to see their usual doctor , not having confidence in their gp and fear of what a doctor would say			0
the research , by the @entity134 and @entity135 , found three quarters had see a gp about their symptoms before being admitted , with a third visiting three times			0
around a quarter had been referred to hospital for tests but were hospitalised before the appointment as their condition deteriorated			0
dr @entity145 , chair of @entity45 ’s lung clinical studies group , said : ‘ if lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage , patients have a much higher chance of surviving the disease			2
' therefore it ’s vital that patients recognise possible symptoms early on and are able to get them checked out quickly			0

@entity3 performs half as many colonoscopies as @entity12 for bowel cancer
@entity13 and @entity14 give the test to three times as many people in @entity3
@entity32 performed the fewest tests for bowel cancer per head in the @entity27
@entity39 patients 50 per cent more likely to be tested out than in @entity3
fewest tests in @entity3 were in @entity35 and the most in @entity37
