snob : education secretary @entity1 came under firms from new children 's laureate @entity3 education secretary @entity1 was today branded a ‘ snob ’ for dismissing teenage books like the @entity7 vampire series			1
new children ’s laureate @entity3 dismissed the idea that young people should only read books written half a century ago			1
and she warned mr @entity1 risked driving the best teachers out of the profession			1
last month mr @entity1 criticised the debasement of @entity15 lessons , saying some schools were telling pupils to read ‘ transient vampire books ’ like the @entity7 instead of ‘ transcendent @entity21 novels ’ such as @entity18 and @entity19			1
but ms @entity3 , today revealed as the eighth children ’s laureate , rejected the minister ’s attitude to popular books			1
“ i do n’t agree with @entity1			2
the point is that they are reading			0
my strategy is to say to a child ‘ if you love vampire stories then have you thought about @entity33 ? , ’ she said			0
she revealed that as a schoolgirl a teacher took a comic from her because it was not considered good reading material , the @entity34 reported			0
‘ the teacher tore it up and said “ do n’t read that rubbish ”			0
that was my hard - earned pocket money			0
it was a snobby attitude and i want to change that , ’ she added			0
her intervention - on the day her appointment was announced - follows a series of clashes between mr @entity1 and the profession which has seen two of the leading teaching unions pass votes of no confidence in the @entity1			2
ms @entity3 said mr @entity1 was in danger of reducing teachers to a ‘ delivery mechanism ’ to get children through tests rather than teaching them to think for themselves			1
critic : @entity3 , announced today as the new @entity61 , said mr @entity1 was wrong to dictate which books children read she said that pupils were paying the price for the ‘ adversarial ’ relationship which had developed between the profession and the @entity67 , while teachers were left feeling demoralised and undervalued			1
‘ i do not know whether he ( mr @entity1 ) trusts teachers or not but the perception is that he does not listen			1
if we are not careful we are in danger of losing our very best teachers , ’ she told @entity69 's @entity70			2
‘ they have got to be more than just a delivery mechanism - some of them feel that 's what they 've been turned into , as a way of just getting children through tests			2
what we should be doing is teaching our children to think and not just to regurgitate facts			0
’ @entity1 criticised the books behind the twilight films staring @entity89 and @entity90 the @entity7 vampire series by author @entity92 was not a patch on @entity94 , mr @entity1 said mr @entity1 insists he is committed to driving up standards in the classroom , but critics of his more traditionalist approach to education accuse him of creating a climate of bullying , fear and intimidation			1
ms @entity3 , the author of the @entity105 series of books , said the confrontational atmosphere was taking its toll on schools			2
‘ i do feel that at the moment the head teachers and teachers and the @entity67 have a relationship that is so adversarial and it is the children who are suffering , ’ she said			0
‘ it is very easy for those who are not in schools every day to come up with edicts about ' we should be doing this and we should be doing that '			0
rushing in with initiative after initiative and initiative means that teachers are becoming demoralised , are feeling they are not valued			0

@entity1 said youngsters should read @entity19 not twilight
new children 's laureate @entity3 said any reading should be *praised*
warned minister 's attitude risked driving the best teachers out of the *proffesion*
