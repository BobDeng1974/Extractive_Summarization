@entity0 is confident @entity1 his @entity3 team - mate @entity2 and commit his future to the @entity6 champions			1
@entity2 recently put pen to paper on a new long - term deal , keeping him at the club until the end of the 2018 - 19 season			1
and now the former @entity14 boss wants @entity1 to do the same			2
@entity1 is in the final year of his contract with @entity6 champions @entity3 @entity0 is hopeful that the @entity17 midfielder will follow @entity2 's example and sign a new deal asked if he expected @entity1 to stay , @entity0 said : ' i think so			1
there are some differences that can be arranged			0
' we are talking with @entity1			2
it is not easy for all the players to sign a new contract			0
there are a lot of things to talk , to decide , discuss			0
i hope finally @entity1 will sign his contract			1
' the same as with @entity2 - he wants to stay and the club wants to keep him			1
' @entity1 , 28 , is in the final season of his current deal and would be free to talk to other clubs from next month			1
his future became the subject of speculation due to his limited action last season but his prominent role this term - featuring in all but two matches - has changed the picture			0
the other major contract speculation at the @entity44 at present concerns @entity47 's loan from sister club @entity48 , which is due to expire at the end of the month			0
@entity2 has committed his long - term future to @entity3 by signing a new deal with the club @entity3 's director of football @entity53 shaking hands with @entity2 after he signed the deal @entity0 hopes to keep the influential 36 - year - old until the end of the season and also claimed last week that @entity47 wanted to stay longer			1
it might be that @entity0 has to settle for a shorter arrangement - for an extra month or two - but no decisions have yet been made			1
@entity0 said : ' it is not just our decision			2
if you ask me if i want @entity47 to stay , of course			0
he is a very important player for our squad and he is playing very well , as the top player he is			0
' maybe in the next days we will be sure but i can not be 100 per cent at this moment			0
' @entity0 's most immediate concern is overcoming the absence of his captain @entity74 and all three of his frontline strikers for the visit of @entity77 in the @entity6 on saturday			2
the @entity79 manager also expressed a desire to keep @entity47 at @entity3 until the end of the season @entity47 is due to join up with @entity83 after @entity84 but his loan deal could be extended @entity74 suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury in his comeback match at @entity89 last week while forward @entity90 hurt his calf in the warm - up			1
frontmen @entity93 and @entity94 were already sidelined			2
the lack of forward options could mean another opportunity for 18 - year - old @entity98 or a change of system to utilise a midfielder such as @entity1 , @entity102 or @entity103 in an advanced position			1
@entity0 said : ' the strikers , the three of them are out for tomorrow			2
we will try to play in another way			0
' i know that we play against a team that defend very well also so we will see what is the best solution to play without them			0
' victory for @entity3 by four goals or more would take them to the top of the table ahead of current leaders @entity120 's trip to @entity121 on monday .			0

@entity2 has signed a new deal with @entity3 until 2018 - 19
@entity0 is confident @entity1 will follow suit
@entity1 is currently in the final year of his @entity3 contract
