@entity0 says the prospect of facing @entity2 scared him more than the idea of taking on @entity4 at @entity5			1
@entity6 will be looking to end a run of four successive @entity9 derby defeats on sunday when @entity4 make the short trip across town			1
@entity12 lost his first encounter with @entity6 's closest rivals last november , when @entity15 struck the only goal in a 1 - 0 win for the @entity18			1
@entity6 boss @entity0 insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing @entity4 @entity12 , pictured with @entity21 on friday , believes @entity4 will not be as defensive - minded as @entity2 @entity6 are currently one point ahead of local rivals @entity4 but @entity12 is confident of victory this weekend , stating that he thinks @entity4 's attacking tendencies will work in @entity6 's favour			1
@entity12 believes teams that come to @entity5 looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat			1
@entity12 is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about sunday 's opposition than he did last week when relegation - threatened @entity2 came to @entity5			1
' i had more fear of @entity2 than @entity4 , ' the @entity6 manager said , before adding : ' @entity2 was more defensive			1
' i do n't expect @entity4 shall play so defensive as @entity2			1
then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence			0
' a long ball is very difficult to defend			0
but ( against ) @entity4 , i do n't expect very much long balls			2
' it 's another game and that 's why i have less fear against @entity4 in spite of losing 1 - 0 against them in the last game			1
' @entity50 scored two goals as @entity6 picked up all three points against @entity2 @entity15 scored the only goal of the match during this season 's previous @entity9 derby that is not to say he would not cherish his first win over @entity4			1
' i dream of it , every player shall dream of the victory , ' the @entity6 boss said			1
during his nine months in charge , assistant manager @entity64 and club chef @entity65 have taught the @entity67 about @entity6 's rivalries			2
but if he needed a reminder of the enmity between @entity4 and @entity6 , he got it this week from his wife @entity71 , whose hairdresser is a blue			1
' i 'm not so often in the city , but when i am there , the people are talking about the derby and even when i come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby , ' @entity12 told @entity81			1
' my wife 's hairdresser is a @entity4 fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women			2
you play football for the fans and i hope we can give our fans the victory			0
' bragging rights are not the only thing at stake			0
@entity98 would strengthen @entity6 's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their ' noisy neighbours '			2
a third - placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the @entity105 and that is what @entity12 is aiming for			1
' when you win , third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that , besides me , of course , ' @entity12 said			2
' @entity113 is good because you are certainly qualified for the @entity105 and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season			2
' @entity118 was sent off during his side 's defeat at the @entity121 back in november @entity118 is heckled by @entity4 supporters as he makes his way off the field the fact that @entity6 and @entity4 are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been			1
but @entity12 has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year , after making a few additions to his squad			2
' i want to improve my selection for the next season			0
then we can make a bigger step , ' he said			0
' sir @entity136 has done it before			0
@entity138 is doing it now			0
' last season he did n't win anything			0
now he is winning the title , now i try to do that also			0
' @entity6 's run of five straight league victories has moved them above @entity4 , who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions			1
the fact that @entity4 have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the @entity67 though			2
' that 's not my history , ' he said			0
' the last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history			0
' @entity118 was the man who was dismissed at the @entity121			0
the defender earned his first booking for blocking @entity162 as he went to kick the ball out of his hands , and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down @entity166			0
@entity12 will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend			2
he said : ' in such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then , so i hope we have learned from that moment			0
' we have had five red cards this year			0
it 's a record in my career as a manager and that 's not good			0

@entity6 boss @entity0 is not *concerned* about @entity4
he insists he feared facing @entity2 because of their defensive set - up
@entity12 dreams of beating rivals @entity4 in his first @entity5 derby match
