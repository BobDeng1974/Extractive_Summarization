by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 thinks the best players in the world will not want to sign for @entity5 while they are out of the @entity6			1
thanks to their seventh - place finish under @entity9 , @entity5 did not qualify for @entity10 last year for the first time in almost a quarter of a century			1
@entity5 have been well behind their rivals in the transfer market this summer too despite the appointment of manager @entity15			1
having his say : former @entity5 striker @entity2 ( left ) spoke out about his old club at the launch of @entity5 and @entity21 's @entity20 poacher : @entity2 in his pomp , scoring against @entity24 in the @entity26 semi-final in 1996 new boys @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 all have potential , but they are currently not in the same league as the likes of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , who have all gone to @entity5 's rivals in the transfer window			1
more signings are expected before the window shuts , but former @entity41 striker @entity2 thinks @entity5 will struggle to sign the very best players			2
' i know a lot of people have been complaining about the club not bringing enough players in , but it gets tougher when you do n't have @entity51 football because if you want to try and bring in the best , you have to entice them with @entity51 football , ' said @entity2 , who was speaking at the launch of @entity5 and @entity21 's @entity20 at @entity54			2
solution ? @entity15 has signed left - backs @entity30 and @entity28 , but reinforcements are needed ' like it or not , every top player wants to play in @entity10 , and this year we are n't playing in it			1
' @entity2 's former team - mate @entity62 said he thinks the club needs to sign five new players to stop them slipping into the ' wilderness '			1
@entity5 have been linked with a number of other players , including @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
new boys : @entity29 has been bought from @entity72 to bolster @entity5 's midfield and @entity2 believes reinforcements are required quickly			1
' i think we need to buy more players , ' said the former @entity5 hitman , who scored 121 times in 275 appearances for the club			0
' we need to improve competition for places			0
if you are going to get stronger you need to buy players			0
' and if you want to finish in a higher position you have got to bring in better players			0
' you have to make sure your football club does that			0
i think it has been tough for them			0
' @entity5 bound ? the @entity41 are reportedly interested in signing @entity68 from @entity92 despite last weekend 's defeat to @entity96 , the former @entity94 frontman believes @entity97 will enjoy a successful debut season at @entity54			1
@entity2 even thinks the title is not beyond @entity5 's reach this term			2
' nothing is above @entity5 , ' he said			0
' many years ago @entity103 said you 'll never win anything with kids and we won the @entity108 that year			0

@entity2 : the world 's best do not want to sign for @entity5
@entity5 finished seventh last season and did not qualify for @entity10
@entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 have all arrived this summer
@entity15 's team lost 2 - 1 to @entity96 on the opening *day* of the season
