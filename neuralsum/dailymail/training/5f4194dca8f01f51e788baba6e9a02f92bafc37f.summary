by @entity0 @entity1 : 05:43 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:37 est , 29 december 2013 the @entity3 is being sued for £ 50,000 over claims a group of six officers allegedly called a suspect a ' black b * * * * * d '			1
@entity9 is taking action after officers ambushed him , smashing the windows of the @entity13 he was driving with baseball bats			1
he claims during the ' unconventional ' arrest one officer turned up the music while his colleagues physically and verbally assaulted him , in a manner designed to ' punish , demoralise and humiliate ' him			1
but the @entity3 claimed in its defence to mr @entity9 's claim that ' officers were permitted to use such force '			1
the @entity37 papers , which were filed in october , have emerged after the six officers failed to sue @entity39 for libel after the programme broadcast footage of the arrest			0
specifically , the six claimed journalist @entity44 had insinuated they misled the @entity29 panel on evidence they had against mr @entity9			2
but the case was thrown out of the @entity37			0
the video showed the men shouting ‘ attack , attack ’ before running at the suspect 's car , smashing the windows and windscreen and telling him to ‘ get out of the car ’ before pinning him to the ground			0
the arrest took place in 2008 - but the @entity29 investigation was not completed until three years later			0
all of the officers , part of the now - disbanded @entity65 , kept their jobs			0
but they have come under further pressure now after mr @entity9 claimed one officer turned up the music in his car as others assaulted him physically and verbally after they had pinned him down on the side of the road			1
the suspect , who was later jailed for two months following the arrest , believed the officers were ‘ muggers ’ because most of them appeared to be wearing plain clothes			0
he said the unconventional manner of the arrest was designed to ' punish , demoralise and humiliate ' him			2
mr @entity9 has said he believed officers were ' muggers ' because they were mostly dressed in plain clothes in the video , police shout ' attack , attack ' before running to the car and telling the suspect : ' get out of the car ' he also claims police failed to say who they were			1
in its defence , the @entity3 said officers shouted ‘ police , police ’ and put a blue flashing siren on one of their cars			2
they said mr @entity9 ‘ was informed that he was under arrest and the grounds of arrest as soon as was practicable ’ - though it does not specify when this was			2
mr @entity9 has also claimed the officers took and failed to return his @entity106 , cds and mobile phone			1
after going to @entity109 , mr @entity9 was taken to @entity110 and treated for a cut on his face believed to have been caused by flying glass			0
in its defence , the @entity3 said mr @entity9 was suspected of driving a stolen car while disqualified from driving			1
officers also claimed that intelligence suggested he would be carrying a knife			0
police have denied mr @entity9 's claim that they did not announce themselves as @entity3 officers the arrest took place in 2008 - and the @entity29 judged officers had used excessive force at a hearing in 2011 they said smashing the windows was being used as a valid ‘ distraction technique ’			1
the defence also questioned the likelihood that mr @entity9 could win the action because the incident took place five years ago			2
police said the arrest took place on the same road mr @entity9 's twin brother had died while being pursued by police - although the suspect , who was in the car at the time , has denied police were involved			1
in 2011 , mr @entity9 told @entity39 : ‘ i personally believe that they may have thought that i have … i may have links or connections			0
' it could have been - not pulling the racial card or anything – but it could have been that because i 'm a male , i 'm a black male , they could have thought that i … or i must know somebody in a gang , or i must know who stole the vehicle or where it came from , but they were mistaken			0
’ the @entity3 confirmed the claim had been lodged , but said : ' it would be inappropriate to comment further			0

six police officers ambushed @entity9 's @entity13 , smashing the windows with baseball bats
@entity164 found that police had used excessive force , but all kept their jobs
' unconventional ' arrest was designed to ' punish , demoralise and humilate ' says mr @entity9 who claims he was physically and verbally assaulted
@entity3 claimed in defence to mr @entity9 's claim for £ 50,000 in *compensation* that ' officers were permitted to use such force '
