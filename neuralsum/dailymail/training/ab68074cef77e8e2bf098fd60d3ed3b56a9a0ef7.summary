by @entity0 it 's the moment every cook dreads : realising they have forgotten the most crucial ingredient			2
now there is an solution for the world 's forgetful chefs - delivering the missing flavour in a fork instead			0
inventors in @entity12 have unveiled the bizarre gadget , which emits smells to make people think they are tasting flavours like ginger , coffee or banana as they eat their meal			0
unorthodox : the fork , shown from behind and from the side , has a capsule filled with ' liquid aroma ' whiff : the fork emits smells which waft over the food and reportedly add to the flavour collection : the unusual gadget is expected to be released later this year - but a full set will cost £ 36 the metal @entity34 comes with 21 different flavours , including chocolate , vanilla , lychee , passionfruit , strawberry , basil , cilantro , mint and almond			1
inventive eaters can also plump for coconut , peanut , cinnamon , ginger , jalapeno , wasabi , butter , olive oil , smoke or truffle			2
it works by having a capsule of ' liquid aroma ' underneath the fork 's handle , which is then soaked through a small circle of blotting paper and released gradually as the owner eats their meal			1
the user has to apply the ' taste ' each time using a dropper and put a piece of blotting paper in place			1
@entity73 , president of the @entity12 inventors ' firm @entity74 - @entity76 , said : ' the initial idea was to reinvent the traditional fork into an improved utensil that would trick people ’s mind by liberating an intense flow of aromas			0
creative : an artist 's impression of the flavours of lychee wafting over a mouthful of food contraption : users put ' liquid aroma ' in the back of the fork using a dropper and it soaks up on blotting paper he claimed it could become ' the perfect educational tool to learn how to better appreciate food			1
' forgetting to buy ginger will set you back , however - a pack of four forks , a full set of ' tastes ' and 50 diffusing papers costs £ 36			0
taste buds on the tongue recognise five primary tastes : sweetness , sourness , saltiness , bitterness , and umami			0
for differences between , for example , sugar and honey or light soy sauce and dark , the nose must do the rest of the job of picking out the subtleties of each piece of food .			2

@entity34 claims to *recreate* lychee , basil , almond , jalapeno and wasabi
owners use a dropper to put ' liquid aroma ' in a capsule under the handle
it then soaks through a piece of blotting paper as a smell in the mouth
