around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity2 - a condition linked to impulsiveness , restlessness and hyperactivity			1
but paediatric neurologist dr @entity9 believes that @entity1 simply ‘ does n’t exist ’ and is being used as a mask for less serious problems			1
around three to seven per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity2 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			1
dr @entity9 argues all these children are being misdiagnosed and claims adhd should n’t be listed in the @entity20 ’s @entity19 ( @entity21 )			1
he claims that @entity1 is nothing more than a collection of symptoms and not a disease , according to a report in the @entity26			1
‘ adhd makes a great excuse , ’ dr @entity9 said in his book , ‘ adhd does not exist : the truth about @entity1 and @entity1			1
’ ‘ the diagnosis can be an easy - to - reach - for crutch			0
moreover , there ’s an attractive element to an adhd diagnosis , especially in adults - it can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once , rather than stuck in a boring rut			2
’ in his own practice , dr @entity9 began looking for other causes of his patients ’ symptoms			1
he found cases such as a young girl who was unruly in school , but it turned out to be that she could n’t see the blackboard and simply needed glasses			0
a 36 - year - old man who thought he had @entity1 was just drinking too much coffee and not getting enough sleep			2
some cases produced no diagnosis			0
one adult , convinced she had adhd and who had been given stimulants , realised it was simply life getting to her after being prescribed regular exercise			2
prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as @entity64 have increased twofold for children and adolescents in the @entity2 with @entity1 , and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008			1
such medications can cause adverse reactions such as weight loss , liver toxicity , and suicidal thoughts , and in the short term may suppress pubertal growth			0
prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as @entity64 increased twofold for children and adolescents in the @entity2 , and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008 echoing dr @entity9 's views , a group of researchers from @entity78 and the @entity79 said in november that the diagnosis of @entity1 may have become too broad			1
a wider classification of symptoms for @entity1 in the psychiatric ‘ bible ’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication , the study warned			2
the group of researchers said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder			0
in addition , stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help , or they are undertreated			0
in a report published on bmj.com , they found a 73 per cent increase for adhd medication in @entity102 between 2000 and 2011			2
to be diagnosed with @entity1 , a patient should meet diagnostic criteria outlined in the @entity20 ’s @entity19 ( @entity21 ) - used around the world to classify mental disorders - or the @entity107 ( @entity107 - 10 )			2
but definitions have been broadened in successive editions of @entity21 , resulting in higher rates of the disorder when compared with @entity107			0
echoing dr @entity9 's views , a group of researchers from @entity78 and the @entity79 said in november that the diagnosis of @entity1 may have become too broad ( picture posed by model ) although clinicians are likely to have got better at detecting and diagnosing @entity1 , some of the rise could stem from over diagnosis or misdiagnosis			1
‘ severe cases of @entity1 are obvious , but in mild and moderate cases - which constitute the bulk of all adhd diagnoses - subjective opinions of clinicians differ ’ , said dr @entity122 , a senior researcher at @entity123 in @entity78			1
‘ the broadening of the diagnostic criteria in @entity21 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis			0
‘ it risks resulting in a diagnosis of @entity1 being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive , skilled specialist help and support ’ she added			0
prof @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , said the @entity2 was different because @entity149 guidelines already recommend careful specialist assessment , with psychological treatments given priority over medication in most cases			0
‘ probably too few children here get help ’ he said			0
in the @entity2 , the increase in stimulants was from a very low base rate : 4.8 per 1,000 schoolchildren in @entity2 compared with around 70 per 1,000 in parts of the @entity162			0

neurologist dr @entity9 claims @entity1 is just a collection of symptoms
patients he saw were , he claims , misdiagnosed with @entity1 when they had issues such as poor sight , lack of sleep and a feeling of ' life getting to them '
3 - 7 per cent of children , or 400,000 , are believed to have adhd in the @entity2
prescriptions for drugs to treat adhd in the @entity2 have increased twofold
