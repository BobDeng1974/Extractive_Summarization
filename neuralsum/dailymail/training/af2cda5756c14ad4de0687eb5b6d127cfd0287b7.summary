known for taking outrageous stands against just about any topic , the fundamentalist church made famous for saying @entity5 hates gays has drawn increasing ire for praising the @entity9 wildfire that killed 19 firefighters and announcing it will picket their funerals			1
in separate tweets , @entity1 thanked @entity5 for the fire and also said they would picket the funerals of the 19 heroic firefighters who lost their lives fighting the blaze			2
awful : @entity1 praises the @entity9 fire and vows to picket the deceased firefighters ' funerals ‘ @entity5 - a consuming fire ! no # @entity23 , rebels # @entity24 # @entity26 , ’ read one tweet			1
‘ @entity1 thanks @entity30 for @entity9 fires that killed 19 firefighters ! ’ read another tweet , complete with a fire breathing thank you graphic			0
repulsing : @entity1 sent out a second tweet praising the fire , this one complete with a blazing graphic thanking @entity5 for the fires taking it a step further , @entity1 then tweeted a press release praising @entity5 for the fire			2
‘ @entity5 sent the @entity9 wildfire ! @entity42 and honour him … not those vile human creatures ! ’ as if that was n’t bad enough , the realse also said that they dead firefighters are in hell and pleading for @entity5 to send @entity1 to picket their funerals			0
even more outrageously , a @entity1 spokesperson took to @entity50 to call the fire a ‘ marvelous work of @entity5 ’ that makes @entity1 ‘ bow in humble thanks and praise to @entity5 ! ’ reaction on @entity50 to these proclamations was annoyed , to say the least			0
some people warned @entity1 not to set foot inside @entity9 , while others called them trash			0
the spokesperson ’s tweets were made with degrading comments about a child she allegedly had out of wedlock			0
horrible : @entity1 sent out a third tweet , this one calling the @entity9 wildfires a ' marvelous work of @entity5 ' tragic : these are the 19 firefighters killed june 30 in the @entity9 wildfires , whom @entity1 said are burning in hell begging the church to picket their funerals recent @entity1 ‘ protests ’ have been met with aggressive counter-protests and have even been turned into fundraisers , according to media reports			1
this may not be necessary in @entity9 though , the state passed a law in 2011 that makes it a criminal offense to picket within 300 feet of a burial site , reported the @entity87			1
though @entity1 's website has a fairly robust list of planned protests , not a single one of them happens to be firefighter 's funeral in @entity9 .			1

the hateful church sent out *multiple* tweets thanking @entity5 for the fire
the group 's website lists all planned protests , but the firefighters ' funerals are not listed
@entity9 has a law making funeral protests a criminal offense
