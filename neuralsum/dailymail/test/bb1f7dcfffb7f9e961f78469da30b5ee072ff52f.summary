@entity37 may be struggling in the @entity3 and looking at a 2015 - 16 campaign without @entity40 football , but in terms of @entity6 followers they dominate the @entity14			1
@entity42 have strong support in @entity44 and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals @entity47 and @entity49			1
in @entity51 , it is a win for @entity53 's @entity52 who dominate the area apart from @entity56 where rivals @entity57 are more popular			2
@entity52 also have pockets of concentrated support across the @entity14			2
@entity47 have strong support in the @entity61 , while clubs such as @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity57 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 dominate their local areas			2
but while @entity37 completely dominate the @entity14 market , their global appeal is less impressive			2
@entity75 ' side have a large following across the world with strong support in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 but find themselves playing second fiddle to the @entity3 's other giants in other areas			1
for instance , the rest of @entity88 apart from @entity79 is dominated by @entity52 - who have strong followings in @entity92 and @entity93 and edge out @entity47 in @entity94 and @entity95 , too			1
while in @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99 it is @entity42 who come out on top			0
the @entity14 ( left ) is dominated by @entity37 green while @entity103 ( right ) is very much a strong hold of @entity47 @entity44 and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting @entity42 's domination , with pockets of support for @entity47 ( blue ) and @entity37 ( green ) @entity111 is somewhat surprisingly dominated by @entity42 ( yellow ) with pockets of support for @entity47 ( blue ) and @entity52 ( red ) @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 ( right ) in action for @entity47 against a @entity116 all - star team during the club 's 2012 tour of @entity103 somewhat surprisingly , @entity52 are only the third best supported team in @entity103 - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having @entity121 owners			1
@entity47 beat @entity123 's side to second but it is @entity42 - whose largest shareholder is @entity121 @entity125 - who dominate across the pond			1
@entity42 and @entity47 also split @entity127 , with @entity129 's side most popular in northern @entity127 countries such as @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 and @entity47 taking the south			1
@entity42 are also well supported in northern @entity135 ( @entity136 and @entity137 ) but further south @entity52 turn @entity135 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity141 red			0
across the globe , @entity42 are the most popular team with 5.6million followers , followed by @entity47 ( 5.4m ) and @entity52 ( 4.8m )			1
the reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated , but certain trends can be explained			0
for instance , there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes			0
@entity156 is pro-chelsea because of @entity157 , @entity82 is a @entity37 stronghold due to the now departed @entity159 and @entity160 is light blue thanks to @entity163 's presence at @entity164			0
@entity42 went on tour to @entity88 in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 @entity167 in @entity168 in the summer in @entity88 it is @entity52 ( red ) who just edge the overall support from @entity47 ( blue ) and @entity42 ( yellow ) @entity37 dominate @entity6 followers in @entity83 with pockets of support for @entity42 , @entity47 and @entity52 as well the @entity178 was packed to 95,000 capacity when @entity37 took on @entity180 in july 2013 and this trend does n't just happen at the so - called bigger @entity3 clubs			1
@entity69 are well supported in @entity98 and @entity81 presumably because of @entity183 and @entity184			0
@entity185 being at @entity186 has boosted @entity188 's following in the striker 's native @entity190 and @entity191 are still popular in @entity192 even though @entity193 has left the club			0
owners may also have a factor - in @entity94 @entity197 have a stronger - than - average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club 's owner @entity199 in the country			0
@entity202 and the former @entity204 countries are very much @entity47 hotbeds and again this may be down to the popularity of @entity208			0
with clubs always jostling to expand their fan base and @entity6 growing popularity , this could be the new battle ground for clubs			0
@entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 all contribute to the popularity of @entity52 , @entity37 and @entity47 across the globe			1
