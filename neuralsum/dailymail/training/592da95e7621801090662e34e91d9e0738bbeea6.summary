@entity3 ’s @entity2 bulb carries the word ‘ eco ’ – will consume ten times more energy than the latest led technology , researchers say households are being misled over light bulbs that are branded as ‘ eco ’ but can burn out in a matter of weeks , campaigners claim			1
@entity12 and @entity3 , two of the biggest manufacturers , are using the term on halogen bulbs that can use ten times more energy than the latest technology			1
consumer groups say the products are being ‘ greenwashed ’ and are fooling the public into thinking they are getting an environmentally - friendly light source that can cut family bills			2
yesterday campaigners threatened legal action as one firm claimed that eco actually stood for ‘ economy ’ – a reference to price rather than the bulb ’s ability to save on power			1
@entity35 bulbs , which cost around £ 1.50 each , are among the least energy - efficient bulbs widely available today and have been surpassed by technologies including leds and compact fluorescent ( @entity41 ) bulbs – some of which will burn ten times less energy			1
the @entity45 estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with @entity38 – which can cost around £ 7 – will save a family £ 40 a year in electricity bills			0
yet @entity12 ’s @entity50 bulb and @entity3 ’s @entity52 bulb both carry the word ‘ eco ’ – even though each has an energy efficiency grade of c or @entity57 – the lowest being @entity58 they will last just 2,000 hours and consume ten times more energy than the latest led technology , researchers say			1
campaign group @entity62 is now calling for the ‘ eco ’ label to be restricted to products which are truly efficient and said it is considering legal action against the companies			1
@entity68 law prevents firms using the phrase ‘ energy - saving lamp ’ when marketing halogens , but does not rule out using the term ‘ eco ’			1
campaign group @entity62 is now calling for the ‘ eco ’ label to be restricted to products which are truly efficient and said it is considering legal action against the companies @entity77 of @entity62 said : ‘ halogens are only eco in comparison to incandescent bulbs that @entity12 and @entity3 know were phased out years ago , yet this packaging is modern			1
‘ whether greenwash or consumer manipulation , the effect is the same – people think they are getting energy savers when in fact they are buying the worst bulbs on the market			2
‘ they would be far better off buying leds or @entity41 bulbs from forward - thinking retailers			0
’ @entity35 bulbs were the most efficient type available when they were invented in the 1960s			0
but since filament technology was phased out in the last few years , halogen bulbs can no longer be classed as energy efficient , say campaigners			0

a spokesman for the @entity109 - based firm said : ‘ @entity110 is an abbreviation for @entity112 as well as for @entity110			0
‘ unlike @entity41 bulbs and led lamps , halogen lamps can be disposed of in household waste as they do not contain electronic components and from a health perspective do not emit electronic magnetic fields			0
’ @entity12 said shoppers are given enough information on packaging to make an informed decision			2
a spokesman pointed out that halogen bulbs would still save more money than traditional incandescent filament bulbs – which are still in some stores because any stocks held at the time of the phase - out in 2011 are allowed to be sold			0
the spokesman added : ‘ our packaging contains information so that consumers can make an informed decision when purchasing a @entity12 light bulb , especially the energy label , which allows consumers to easily compare one product to another and makes very clear what the energy consumption of the bulb is			1
’ @entity145 , of think - tank the @entity147 , said : ‘ this will disappoint @entity148 who ’ve invested in these bulbs believing that they were saving money and doing something to reduce climate change			0
‘ both @entity12 and @entity3 have made impressive - sounding statements regarding their commitment to tackling climate change , and this news is likely to make some people question how serious the companies are			0
