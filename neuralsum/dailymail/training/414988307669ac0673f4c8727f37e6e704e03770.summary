mr @entity58 stated that data protection laws will not be used to protect them , arguing : ' they are wanted men and should be treated as such			0
' that 's why on my watch we will not hold back their names , unless the police ask us not to for operational reasons			0
' it comes after a @entity81 request by the @entity82 to release the identities of missing prisoners had been rejected by the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) - without considering whether it would be in the public interest to release the information			2
the request was made after armed robbed @entity89 - known as ' skull cracker ' - absconded while on temporary release from an open prison three weeks ago			1
mr @entity58 said : ' the police catch most of them quickly			0
even so , i think the rules in open prisons have been too lax and i am tightening them			2

' from the end of this year , we 'll also use gps tags to monitor where they are			0
