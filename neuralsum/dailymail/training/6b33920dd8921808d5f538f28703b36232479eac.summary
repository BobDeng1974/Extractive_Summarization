if you 've ever woken up bewildered by a dream you were having , there 's now an explanation as to why			0
scientists have discovered our dreams really do get weirder as the night goes on			1
' we found that dreams increase in bizarreness from the early to late night , ' said study author dr @entity10 , of the @entity11			1
shortly before a person wakes up , their dreams escalate to a level of the impossible - and never likely to happen in real life - ' like a wild animal tearing up your back garden , ' she told @entity20			1
during the study , researchers gave 16 people an eyelid and head sensor to monitor their sleep			2
they then woke each person up four times in the night , journalist @entity36 reports			2
participants were asked to recall the subject of their dreams and discuss them - and how they might relate to their life - the following morning			2
in the early stages of sleep , dreams tended to be more about the people had encountered that day , such as a tv programme or a book			2
dreams about life events were more likely to feature later in the night			1
dr @entity10 says exploring these dreams can help us get more in touch with our emotional side and behaviour			2
she said : ' people feel like they have n't generated them because they 're often so bizarre			0
[ but ] they 're a safe way to explore the self			0
' there are two stages of sleep - @entity62 and non-rem sleep			0
during the latter , we experience slow wave sleep , when our immune system is repaired and strengthened			0
however being under the weather can also trigger strange dreams and nightmares , experts say			1
any kind of infection , from severe flu to a kidney infection , can make nightmares more likely , explains @entity77 , associate professor of neurology at @entity79			1
being ill , such as having an infection , can trigger nightmares , research has shown ' when we get an infection , with or without a fever , the body needs more slow wave sleep			1
this is so the immune system can fight the bug			0
however , he adds it also has a knock - on effect on @entity62 , delaying the point at which we enter dreaming sleep			0
' this , in turn , can lead to nightmares or bizarre , vivid dreams			1
' as @entity62 sleep is when we process emotions , this can cause a build - up of unpleasant emotions which may manifest as nightmares			0
some experts also believe premenstrual syndrome can lead to more nightmares			0
a 2008 study found women reported significantly more nightmares than men ( 30 per cent of women 's most recent dreams were nightmares compared with 19 per cent of men )			1
study author dr @entity116 , a psychologist at the @entity117 , said the nightmares were linked to temperature changes that occurred at certain times in a woman 's cycle			1
previous research has found women with @entity125 are more likely to have nightmares the increase in the hormone progesterone , which women experience before a period , causes their body temperature to rise and has been linked to @entity125 - related insomnia			1
this can cause night sweats and hot flushes , as well as vivid dreams and nightmares			1
' @entity125 women tend to dream more aggressively and are more likely to remember dreams , ' adds dr @entity140			1
not getting enough shut - eye in the week could explain nightmares during your weekend lie - in			0
many women also report more bizarre dreams around the menopause , says dr @entity147 , a consultant gynaecologist at @entity148			1
up to ten years preceding the menopause , levels of female hormone oestrogen significantly drop			0
this affects levels of serotonin , a brain chemical associated with hot flushes , mood swings and night sweats , and can lead to sleep disruption in around 15 per cent of women , he says			2
this can cause excessive tiredness and more broken sleep			0
sometimes our nightmares can reflect waking health concerns , such as breathing problems			2
a study published in the journal @entity170 in 2006 found those with breathing problems during wakefulness often reported dreaming about being choked or suffocated ; those who perspired excessively while awake often dreamed about sweating			2
' our dreaming brains deal in metaphors and symbols , ' says professor @entity77			0
' during @entity62 sleep , the brain tries to capture and process overwhelming sensations , things that are troubling us , or that we ca n't put into words			0
it does this through the pictures we see in our dreams			0

dreams increase in bizarreness as the night wears on , psychologists found
shortly before waking , they escalate to a level of the impossible
previous study found women with @entity125 are more likely to have nightmares
being ill with an infection can also trigger them , as can menopause
