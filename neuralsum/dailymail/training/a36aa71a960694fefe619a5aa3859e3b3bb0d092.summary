by @entity0 a couple has been handed a £ 900 bill from @entity3 for pornography over a five - year period - despite the fact that they insist they have never ordered any			1
@entity8 , 72 , and @entity9 , 75 , who live in a one - bedroom bedsit in @entity11 , @entity12 , now have no internet or television because the provider have accused the couple of ' abusing ' services			1
the great - grandparents first received a bill for almost £ 200 in 2009 , and another £ 200 last week			1
they were also sent another letter ordering them to pay more than £ 500 for blue films			1
users can also buy a monthly subscription package to channels such as @entity35 for a monthly fee of £ 11			0
for the price of the bill , the couple could have watched 150 16 - hour stints through different channels or a total of 2,404 hours of pornography - the equivalent of 100 days			1
but the pensioners , who live in a quiet housing block for elderly residents , were adamant they had never ordered , let alone watched , the pornographic films			1
the company then agreed to waive the bills and said they would remove the ‘ on demand ’ feature			0
it was not until they upgraded their service to @entity3 ’s latest ' @entity57 ' box last month that they reluctantly agreed to reactivate their on demand services , and problems resurfaced			2
mrs @entity61 said : ' because of what happened before , we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time ' the @entity57 box allows viewers to record up to 500 hours of television			1
mrs @entity61 , 72 , said : ' because of what happened before , we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time			2
' the lady i spoke to promised me that we had absolutely nothing to worry about and that there was no way it could happen again			0
' after a couple of days a message appeared on the tv saying ‘ channels unavailable ’ and i had a feeling something was n’t right - that ’s one of the things that happened the last time			2
' i started to get a bit worried so i called them the next day , just to be told that i had ordered more than £ 200 worth of films			1
' i was in complete shock - i just could n’t believe it was happening to us all over again after they reassured us that everything would be okay			0
' pictured : the @entity57 box can record up to 500 hours of television			0
when the couple subscribed to the box ( not this one pictured ) , problems resurfaced last week , the elderly couple received another bill for watching dozens of 18 - rated films a day - costing more than £ 200			1
@entity3 staff have now told the @entity102 that all of their services will be cancelled because ‘ they are abusing the service ’ - and they have until 9th may to find a new provider for their telephone , broadband and tv			1
retired nursery nurse mrs @entity61 said : ' i told them i ’m not paying a penny of these bills - they insist it is us , but they wo n’t even tell us what time the films have supposedly been downloaded			1
' i just feel like i am being ignored and it makes me so mad that this big company can just brush off their customers like that			0
' just because they ca n’t find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us			2
' we are retired and in our 70s , we ca n’t afford to pay out to have everything installed again			0
' the pair has a large family with five sons , 12 grandchildren and four great - grandchildren but both @entity137 and mrs @entity61 are adamant that no one else has had access to the television			2
to watch adult films through @entity3 , the user has to enter an adult pincode			1
mrs @entity61 added : ' we live alone in a small bedsit , in a secure residential complex - no one else has access to our flat			0
mrs @entity61 said : ' just because they ca n't find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us			2
' ' if we lived in a big house with a big family then maybe i could understand it , as you could n’t know what was happening in every room			0
' you would n’t believe the conversations we have had to have with our family , friends and neighbours about it all			0
' there is obviously something wrong with the technology or someone somewhere is hacking into our services , and if it can happen to us it can happen to anyone			0
' @entity3 just keep insisting that the films have been bought using our box and that it must be us doing it			1
but it is n’t as if someone has been sneaking in and out of our flat			0
' the whole situation is just ridiculous			0
i am just completely gobsmacked , they were supposed to have made the situation better for us , but they have just made it worse			0
' @entity184 , from @entity3 , said : ' these films were unquestionably watched by someone in the @entity102 ’ home			1
' we are happy to arrange a payment plan but have said they may want to find an alternative provider going forward			2

@entity8 and @entity9 , from @entity11 , first handed £ 200 bill in 2009
couple insist never watched any adult films at home but bills continue
@entity3 said films were ' unquestionably ' watched at @entity9 house
the couple now have until may 9 to find a new television provider
cost would be equivalent to watching 150 16 - hour stints of pornography
