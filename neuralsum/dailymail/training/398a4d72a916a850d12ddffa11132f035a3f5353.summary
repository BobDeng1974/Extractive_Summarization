by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 06:05 est , 14 august 2012 @entity2 scientists have developed a self - driving robotic race car that can hit 120mph on the test track			1
the white @entity5 was put through its paces on the @entity7 , north of @entity8 , @entity9			1
the autonomous car raced round the three mile course in two and a half minutes , a time that rivals those posted by professional drivers			1
the software that tells @entity15 when to brake , how tight to turn , and when to push the pedal to the metal , was tested by @entity19 at @entity7			1
the researchers claim the route @entity15 takes is nearly the same as the one a professional racing driver would take			2
the @entity5 tts is kitted out with antennas and sensors to help it navigate around the track however , despite the autonomous car 's sophisticated technology , it still ca n't quite compete with human - driven equivalents			1
' human drivers are very , very smooth , ' said @entity19			2
@entity15 computes the fastest line around a course and executes the exact corrections required to stick to it			0
a person relies more on feel and intuition , and thus may , for example , allow the car to swing too wide in one turn if he knows it sets him up better for the next			1
' human drivers are ok with the car operating in a comfortable range of states , ' said @entity19			1
' we 're trying to capture some of that spirit			0
' @entity19 and his students will have the opportunity to do just that this weekend at the @entity71 races at the @entity72			0
the group has enlisted two professional drivers to wear a suite of biological sensors as they race around the track			1
graduate research team leader @entity19 shows off the systems carried onboard the autonomous car , a modified @entity5 the sensors will record variables such as the driver 's body temperature and heart rate			1
scalp electrodes will be used to register the driver 's brain activity as they race against other humans to determine which driving maneuvers require the most concentration and brainpower			0
the biological data will be paired with mechanical performance data from the car – a 1966 @entity95 , the only @entity97 - built automobile to finish first overall at the @entity99 race – which @entity2 has kitted out with feedback sensors similar to those on @entity15			2
' we need to know what the best drivers do that makes them so successful , ' said @entity19			2
' if we can pair that with the vehicle dynamics data , we can better use the car 's capabilities			2
' the team believes that the experience and the data they have gained can be used to develop autonomous vehicles for use on public roads			0
in the nearer term , the technology could be used as an onboard co-pilot that helps the driver steer out of a dangerous situation			0
the reality of racing a car round a track and pushing that vehicle to its absolute limit means that it will be subjected to exceptionally high levels of stress			0
the recent tests left poor @entity15 without any brake pads due to the intense heat generated by friction between the tyres and the pads themselves			0
pushing a car to the limit on the racetrack is one of the best ways to find out what type of stress that car is under in a crisis			0
' if we can figure out how to get @entity15 out of trouble on a race track , we can get out of trouble on ice , ' said @entity19 .			0

*driverless* @entity5 hit speeds of 120mph , rivalling professional drivers
relies on a *series* of algorithms to brake , corner and *accelerate*
technology could be used to help drivers avoid car *crashes*
