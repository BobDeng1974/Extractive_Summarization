the case , which will cost the @entity7 taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds , is likely to be one of the most expensive ever heard in @entity7			1
it is being brought by lieutenant colonel @entity2 , one of the men accused of involvement in the arrest , torture and murder of @entity10 lawyer @entity4 who died in @entity27 in 2009			1
and it follows a high - profile campaign led by mr @entity4 ’s former boss , @entity30 , who wants more than 60 @entity10 suspects held to account for the lawyer ’s death			1
but mr @entity2 has hired top @entity7 lawyers to sue mr @entity30 for defamation in a trial that opens on july 24			1
the case is cited as one of the worst examples of libel tourism – where foreign nationals with little or no connection to the @entity7 use the @entity16 to settle their disputes			2
last night senior @entity45 mp @entity44 said : ‘ it is absolutely ludicrous a man i hope will never set foot in this country except to face criminal proceedings himself is able to abuse @entity7 libel law in this way			0
’ it comes after a @entity27 court last week posthumously convicted mr @entity4 of tax fraud and convicted mr @entity30 in his absence , sentencing him to nine years in jail			0

libel case : @entity30 , a businessman who was mr @entity4 's boss , is being sued for defamation after linking @entity2 to his death mr @entity2 ’s lawyers insist that while mr @entity30 ’s quest to pursue those who killed mr @entity4 might be legitimate , his campaign has wrongfully made false claims against mr @entity2			1
lawyers for mr @entity30 , including @entity96 , have stood by the claims and say they will show in court mr @entity2 is a prominent figure in a @entity10 organised crime ring , the @entity100 , that specialises in complex financial frauds			1
