@entity5 ’s ‘ @entity4 ’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system ’s largest storm			1
the @entity5 storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years and has winds screaming at hundreds of miles per hour			1
it usually appears as a deep red oval surrounded by swirling layers of white , yellow , orange , but this latest image casts it in a new light			0
@entity5 ’s ‘ @entity4 ’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system ’s largest storm			1
the @entity5 storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years a gigantic storm twice as big as @entity23 , the spot was first observed 300 years ago			1
like a hurricane on @entity23 , the center is relatively calm , but farther out , the winds scream at 425mph ( 680km/h )			1
the spot , whose main cloud layer is likely ammonia , appears to be an area of upwelling , in which clouds form from below			0
the spot is technically an anticyclone - a cyclones whirling in the other direction			0
infrared images such as this can cut through the gas and dust captured in visible light photos the image , released by the @entity45 of @entity46 , also shows @entity5 ’s moon , @entity48 in the upper right appearing as three coloured dots			1
the effect is due to the fact @entity48 moved during the time required to take the three separate colour images			1
the image was taken by a camera mounted on the @entity57 , a 27ft ( 8.2 metre ) instrument located atop @entity60 volcano on @entity62 's @entity61			0
the @entity4 seen in this image has baffled astronomers for years , and the cause of its has remained a mystery			0
one theory put forward in november is that the red spot is in fact , sunburn			0
@entity72 said it believes the spot is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet 's upper atmosphere			0
the results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot 's striking colour - that the reddish chemicals come from beneath @entity5 's clouds			1
the image follows another stunning shot of the gas giant revealed last week by @entity72			0
the ' spot ' is a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet 's upper atmosphere @entity93 captured the rare sight of three of @entity5 's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet 's banded face			1
the telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 — in action 601 million miles ( 968 million km ) from @entity23			2
the @entity5 lunar gathering , which happens only once or twice a decade , was captured on january 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame			2
@entity5 is composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium , with just a sprinkling of other elements			2
scientists are interested in understanding what combinations of elements are responsible for the hues seen in @entity5 's clouds , as this would provide insights into the giant planet 's make - up			2
earlier this month , @entity93 captured the rare sight of three of @entity5 's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet 's banded face			0
the telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 — in action 601 million miles ( 968 million km ) from @entity23			0

the gigantic storm on @entity5 is thought to be twice as big as @entity23
image was released by the @entity45 of @entity46
it also shows @entity5 ’s moon , @entity48 appearing as three coloured dots
