@entity11 of @entity12 first became involved with the scouting and @entity15 movements when she enrolled in her local troop of @entity5 in @entity17 , @entity18 , at the age of eight			1
more than two decades later , she became a volunteer leader in the @entity21			1
writing in the @entity22 , the @entity6 says : ‘ i need hardly say that i am particularly delighted that my daughter - in - law has helped to swell the ranks of much - needed scout volunteers , since enrolling many more adults as leaders is the greatest need for so many of our youth organisations			1
’ when the @entity11 joined the group in january 2012 , a spokesman for @entity32 explained that she ‘ loved the idea of @entity14 and working hands - on with children ’ , and felt that the organisation was well - suited to her own love of the outdoors			1
her decision to join the @entity10 , rather than the @entity41 , marked a change in times			0
once only for males , the @entity10 now boast 66,000 female members and in 2011 recruited more girls than boys			0
the @entity49 ’s involvement in the @entity21 has prompted a huge increase in the number of adults signing up to help , with more than 2,800 volunteering since she joined			1
not content to be a figurehead , the @entity11 has taken part in numerous scouting activities			0
joining in : @entity11 of @entity12 cooks with scouts in the @entity58 in march in march , @entity4 , then five months pregnant , met a troop in the @entity58 for a day of outdoor adventures , including baking bread on an open fire in the snow			1
just a few weeks later , she took part in a ceremony honouring the @entity10 at @entity66 , where she was praised as ‘ an incredible role model ’ by adventurer and chief scout @entity70			1
prince @entity6 first experienced the satisfactions of volunteering during his schooldays at @entity75			1
@entity6 – who loathed his time at the austere @entity78 boarding school – found consolation in throwing himself into extra-curricular activities such as the @entity81			0
he also became a volunteer coastguard when he joined the school ’s surf - rescue unit			2
the prince , who still speaks fondly of his time in the cadets , proved himself to be adept and determined , according to his biographer , @entity87			2
in his second year at the school he was ‘ skilled enough to paddle from @entity89 to @entity90 – 12 miles in a direct line but almost double the distance allowing for wind and tide ’			0
it was during one of these adventurous outings that the most notorious incident of @entity6 ’ schooldays took place			0
quick step : prince @entity6 , centre behind a man in white uniform , on duty with the school 's @entity81 as a member of the four - man crew of the @entity109 , one of the school ’s ketches , the 14 - year old prince sailed into @entity114 harbour on the @entity115			2
during shore leave , he walked into a bar and ordered a ‘ cherry brandy ’			0
a journalist overheard him and the underage prince ’s misdemeanour became global news			2
after the furore , the headmaster demoted @entity6 within the cadets			0
the @entity6 was also the victim of bullying during his schooldays at @entity75			0
and this may have shaped his campaign to stop teenagers drifting into street gangs			0
@entity6 endured beatings , extortion , rifling through his personal belongings and @entity135 wrote : ‘ the prince bore this thuggery with stoicism , apparently nurturing no enmity , though it reinforced his abhorrence of gangs			2

*duchess* of @entity12 enrolled in her local brownies in @entity17 , @entity18 , when she was eight years old
two decades later she became a volunteer leader in the @entity21
prince today praised her work with the organisation and said she had helped ' swell the ranks ' of scout volunteers
