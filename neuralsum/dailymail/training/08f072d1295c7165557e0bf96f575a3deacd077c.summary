the teenager was charged with assault by beating and has been dragged to court five times since the february incident			1
his ordeal until only ended on thursday when magistrates ruled there was no case to answer and threw the case out			1
yesterday , the boy 's mother said she was furious at prosecutors for ever bringing the case and denied her son had even thrown the snowball			1
the woman , who can not be identified to protect the anonymity of her son , said : ' the past six months have been a nightmare for my son , with this ridiculous prosecution hanging over him			1
' we were so relieved when the magistrates said there was no case to answer but we are angry it ever came to this			1
' @entity43 only knows how much this prosecution has cost the taxpayer			2
we 've been told it 's many thousands of pounds			2
what a waste of money			2
' my son has been treated like a criminal and for what ? a snowball that may or may not have been thrown , may or may not have hit a person and in any case was not thrown by him			2
' the maximum sentence for an adult convicted of assault by beating is six months in custody , and the @entity58 said the penalty remains the same for youth offenders - although magistrates would be more likely to take account of a defendant 's young age and mitigation when sentencing at a youth court			2
the teenager was arrested at his home the morning after a teenage girl complained he had thrown a snowball at her at a local recreation area			2
the boy 's mother , who lives with her family in a village near @entity75 , added : ' he 's only a young boy and was frightened			1
he was kept in a cell all day and all night			2
' she said her ' jaw dropped ' when he was charged with assault by beating and appeared in court the following day			0
what cost to the taxpayer ? the boy 's six - month ordeal finally came to an end this week when magistrates at @entity88 ( above ) threw the case out			0

the family attended court sessions on five occasions , including a trial at @entity100 , in march , when the case was adjourned			0
at thursday 's @entity88 hearing , the teenage complainant and two other witnesses gave evidence			0
but none could be sure the boy , who had been having a snowball fight with a friend , had targeted the complainant			0
after listening to the prosecution case , magistrates ruled there was no case to answer			0
his mother added : ' the whole thing has been totally @entity117 ( @entity11 ) should have never sanctioned this prosecution			1
' she said she wanted an apology from the @entity11			1
speaking after the case , the boy said : ' i just want to put all this behind me now and get on with things			0
the past six months have been horrible			0
' a @entity11 spokesman said there had been ' clear evidence the complainant had been deliberately targeted and that this was more than just a youthful snowball fight			1
' he added : ' the evidence , including two witness statements , pointed to the fact the defendant had made and thrown the snowball and made comments of a hostile nature afterwards			0
' this , coupled with the fact that the complainant was recovering from a serious eye injury , meant a court should be asked to judge the case			0
' if , however , during a hearing , evidence by witnesses appears to fluctuate from the statements provided , a court can determine there is no case to answer			0
' guidance issued by the @entity153 says custodial sentences for juveniles should only be imposed in the most serious cases			0
