a group of @entity2 mps have called for former leader @entity3 to be prosecuted fro the breakup of the @entity5 23 years ago @entity2 mps are making an extraordinary bid to have @entity3 prosecuted for the ' illegal ' collapse of the @entity5 more than two decades ago			1
they are calling for a criminal probe into the last leader of the @entity5 , a man widely respected around the world for ending the @entity12			1
one mp in @entity15 's @entity14 even branded 83 - year - old @entity3 a ' @entity17 spy ' for the break - up of the communist state 23 years ago			1
he also argued that the legal move would offer succour to @entity23 groups in other states seeking to revert to @entity26 rule			0
@entity3 today called the @entity1 ' move ' sheer stupidity ' , adding : ' these people just do not have shame			1
' i do not react to such statements			0
i am doing my business and taking care of my health			0
' the legal demand from a multi-party group in the @entity2 parliament comes after @entity39 has annexed its former territory of @entity41 including naval port @entity42 , and amid fears that its massing troops could lead to a new land grab in @entity50 neighbour @entity48			1
the group has petitioned @entity2 prosecutor general @entity52 with a view to criminal cases against those responsible for allowing the @entity56 of @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 to secure independence and the later break - up of the remaining republics of the @entity5			1
' the @entity1 are hoping for opening criminal cases in future based on results of this prosecutor 's investigation , one of such cases would be against the last @entity5 leader , @entity3 , ' reported @entity2 daily paper @entity71			1
mp @entity72 , of @entity14 who claims @entity3 is currently in @entity73 , said : ' we need a full and reliable legal analysis of the event in 1991			1
we must consider the fact of deliberate liquidation of power institutions			0
' @entity3 ( pictured on a visit to @entity81 in 1991 ) is widely credited with ending the @entity12			1
his resignation on christmas day 1991 symbolised the decision to break up the @entity5 ' i do not think @entity73 will extradite him if the investigation proves his guilt in the collapse of the country and his status of a @entity17 spy , according to which he was forming all his policy in those days			1
' the legal probe was needed to ' draw the right historic and political picture which would let us make straight conclusions			0
and after all , it would encourage national liberation movements in former @entity5 territories			1
' @entity101 mp @entity100 said : ' so far there has been no legal opinion on the fact of tearing states to pieces			0
but everything supports the idea that it was a pre-planned action , and those guilty must be made responsible , including @entity3			1
' we are still experiencing the consequences of the event in 1991			0
people in @entity114 are dying and will keep dying because those in the @entity26 many years ago have decided to break down the country			0
' the mps , including @entity118 , complained that the decision to end the @entity5 - symbolised by @entity3 's resignation on christmas day 1991 - was taken despite a referendum which opposed a break - up			1
current @entity2 president @entity15 ( pictured talking to @entity3 in 2004 ) has called the breakup of the @entity124 the ' greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century ' the latest move appears to be inspired by @entity15 's view that ' the collapse of the @entity5 was a major geopolitical disaster of the century			1
as for the @entity2 nation , it became a genuine drama			2
' tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside @entity2 territory			2
moreover , the epidemic of disintegration infected @entity2 itself			2
' @entity142 general secretary @entity141 has today told @entity2 to withdraw its troops from the @entity48 border @entity145 , the head of @entity146 of @entity147 , said the matter needed a judicial decision			2
' @entity15 was the first to give the right evaluation of this event			2
he called it the largest geopolitical catastrophe			0
' all of us can have different opinions but we can not argue with this statement			0
it was an unprecedented case - the state liquidated itself			0
' it is good that this matter is raised again			0
and lawyers should deal with it , not politicians or historians			0
she stated : ' many participants of those days events are peacefully living at the territory of @entity2 and in other countries now			2
' if their guilt is proved by evidence , i think it is fair to initiate sanctions against them			0
' @entity3 claimed the @entity1 wanted ' to pr themselves ' , arguing : ' the appeal is not well thought through , and from the view of historic facts - it is absolute groundless			2
' protesters in eastern @entity48 have this week called on @entity15 to intervene to guarantee their rights , despite warnings from @entity142 of further sanctions if they intervene			1
@entity142 general secretary @entity141 said today that any further military action by @entity2 would lead to grave consequences and severe economic sanctions			2
he said : ' from @entity188 , i have this message to @entity2 : you have a choice to stop blaming others for your own actions , to stop massing your troops , to stop escalating this crisis and start engaging in a genuine dialogue			0
' if @entity2 is serious about a dialogue , the first step should be to pull back its troops			0
' @entity2 has roughly 40,000 troops stationed along the @entity48 border and has threatened to act to protect its citizens inside the country			0
today @entity205 activists have been demonstrating in the eastern city of @entity207 @entity48 leaders claim the trouble in its @entity2 - speaking regions has been fomented by @entity39 's secret services			1
@entity2 , the @entity17 , @entity48 and the @entity124 will hold talks next thursday in @entity214 to try to negotiate an end to the crisis in @entity48 , @entity124 diplomats said on thursday			1
@entity141 said earlier this week @entity142 was reviewing a 1997 co-operation agreement with @entity2 and subsequent @entity219 declaration of 2002 that prevented @entity142 setting up bases in eastern and central @entity221			0

@entity5 was *dismantled* under leadership of @entity3
former president is well regarded for also helping to end @entity12
now group of @entity2 mps have called for him to be prosecuted
one from president @entity15 's party has even branded him a ' @entity17 spy '
@entity3 , 83 , said move is ' sheer stupidity ' adding mps had ' no shame '
