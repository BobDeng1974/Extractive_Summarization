by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 17 october 2013 @entity1 called on the government to slash winter fuel payments and free tv licences pensioners must shoulder some of the burden of the spending cuts or their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state , the government ’s social mobility tsar has said			1
@entity1 , a health secretary under @entity12 , called on the government to slash universal benefits for over- 65s such as free tv licences and winter fuel payments			1
he said it was ‘ unfair ’ that better - off pensioners were protected from the impact of the cuts while working families with children were bearing two - thirds of the burden of cutting the deficit			1
his comments were dismissed as ‘ bonkers ’ by pensioners ’ groups , as well as deputy prime minister @entity30 , who said : ‘ punishing pensioners is n’t going to help a single child achieve more in life			2
’ @entity35 ’s official spokesman also dismissed the claims , saying : ‘ the prime minister believes it ’s right to make the commitments he ’s made to pensioners and to introduce the triple lock which means pensioners will get a 2.7 per cent rise			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s @entity44 unveiled its report on the state of the nation yesterday			2
he warned that the burden of cuts had fallen disproportionately on middle - class families , and that for the first time in more than a century there was a risk that the next generation of adults could end up with lower living standards than today ’s generation			0
as a result , mr @entity1 claimed pensioners should shoulder more of the burden			2
the report highlights that the number of pensioners is rising , their state benefits are going up and the numbers who can fund them are in decline			0
it said ministers had allowed an ‘ inter-generational injustice ’ which sees better - off pensioners protected but families with children bearing two - thirds of spending cuts			1
‘ we do not believe that favouring pensioners over their children and grandchildren will be a sustainable position over the long - term if a meaningful dent is to be made in the @entity86 ’s high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility , ’ it added			1
mr @entity1 said pensioners should shoulder more of the burden and said their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state ( file picture ) @entity30 said : ' punishing pensioners isn ¿ t going to help a single child achieve more in life ' mr @entity1 later told the @entity99 that the @entity100 was simply trying to protect its share of the vote among pensioners			1
‘ i just do n’t think it ’s right that you have ordinary hardworking middle - income families who are finding their finances being squeezed and their public finances being cut and , at the same time , wealthy pensioners seeing their benefits not just protected but enhanced , ’ he said			2
‘ i think that is going to be increasingly hard to justify			0
’ he added that sparing pensioners from being charged the spare room subsidy if they rented homes that were bigger than they needed was also ‘ part of the same picture ’			0
‘ pensioner benefits are rising by 17.5 per cent during the course of this parliament , ’ he said			0
‘ that is equivalent to half of the reductions in expenditure on welfare			0
‘ i understand politically why a government would want to protect pensioners who vote , but you ca n’t say you want a fair fiscal deficit reduction and then you do n’t do it fairly			0
’ polls showed wealthy pensioners would be happy to give up their winter fuel allowances and free tv licences and bus passes , mr @entity1 said , adding that cutting perks for all but the poorest pensioners – who receive pension credit – could save £ 1.4billion a year			1
‘ grandparents are more concerned about what is good for their children than themselves			0
‘ the decline in social mobility is not just a problem for low - income families , it ’s definitely a problem for middle - income families too			1
‘ the gap is widening between the wages that people are getting , the prices that they are paying and the fact that their children are finding it hard to get on the housing ladder			0
‘ that is the reason why @entity155 is feeling uncomfortable about the prospects for the next generation			0
