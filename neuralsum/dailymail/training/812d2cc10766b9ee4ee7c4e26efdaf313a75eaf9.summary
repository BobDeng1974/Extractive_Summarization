@entity3 is thought to be the first child in the @entity20 to be fitted with an arm made with the revolutionary printing technology			1
he has used it to help decorate the tree , and it means he can now ride his scooter			0
but just as importantly , having a superhero arm is helping @entity3 fit in with his peers			1
his mother @entity39 said : ‘ it will change his life			0

he ca n’t stop smiling			0

the @entity82 network of engineers and academics designed the arm before having it made using a 3d printer based in @entity87			1

‘ he never needed anything else , he just adapted to doing things without any proper hands			0

’ then two months ago mrs @entity39 heard about @entity58 , based in @entity82 , @entity59			0
she said : ‘ i went on their website and i had to send photos of @entity3 and his measurements			2

then it was printed off the printer			0
mrs @entity39 said : ‘ @entity3 has always managed really well , but now he can feel more like the other children now that he ’s got his new hand			2
