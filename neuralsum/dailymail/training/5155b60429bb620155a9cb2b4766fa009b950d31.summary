as revealed by @entity2 's @entity1 , the @entity0 are exploring the possibility of a live sunday night fixture in an attempt to keep @entity6 and @entity7 happy			1
with competition between the two broadcasters stiffer than ever , the @entity0 are looking into creating another live television slot when the next three - year agreement comes into effect in the 2016 - 17 season			1
but would a live sunday night @entity0 fixture work ? we explore the pros and cons. the @entity0 are exploring the possibility of introducing a sunday night fixture advantages 1			1
another live game means another one we can watch			0
the @entity0 would ditch another saturday 3pm kick - off , meaning we could watch the entire match live rather than wait all night until @entity25 or @entity26			1
sunday night fixtures are a regular in most of @entity30 's top leagues			1
this sunday night , for example , @entity32 take on @entity34 in @entity36 's @entity35 , @entity31 face @entity37 in @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity42 host @entity40 in @entity44 's @entity43			1
instead of being left with a choice of continental action at 6pm on a sunday night once @entity6 's @entity47 finishes , why not have another @entity0 game to watch ? @entity7 and @entity6 paid the @entity0 £ 3billion for the live rights from 2013 - 2016 3			1
the terrestrial television line - up on sunday night is pretty weak			1
a live @entity0 game on a sunday night would mean not having to sit through the @entity53 , x factor results show or @entity54			1
selling another live game would mean even more money generated			2
the @entity0 raked in more than £ 5billion from broadcasters around the world from 2013 to 2016 with £ 3bn of that coming from the @entity60			2
but the @entity0 only sold 154 games from a total of 380 @entity63 and @entity7 , with each game costing just shy of £ 20million			1
at that rate , an extra 38 live games ( one every week ) would generate another £ 760m			2
the @entity0 are looking at an extra game on a sunday night - that means in addition to @entity71 double bill we currently enjoy on @entity6			1
could you imagine how good a triple header of live @entity0 action would be ? just three of @entity77 's 13 @entity0 games from august to november are not televised disadvantages 1			0
it would create even more travel problems for supporters , who are already given little consideration			0
it 's quite an effort to make your way home from the other side of the country after a midweek game , but the sunday public transport service creates some logistical nightmares for fans			0
sunday is generally a day to be spent with the family			0
that time has already been shortened to the evening due to @entity47 dominating the afternoon agenda			0
surely fathers , husbands and boyfriends ca n't blag another 90 minutes in front of the television			0
@entity102 's clash with @entity103 featured as part of @entity6 's @entity47 double header last weekend 3			0
the international audience can not be underestimated , especially in @entity107			0
a match starting in the evening in @entity109 would take place in the early hours of the morning in places such as @entity112 and @entity113			0
@entity36 's @entity35 are making an effort to bring their kick - off times forward from the evening to the afternoon to compete with the @entity0 in markets such as the @entity117			2
in terms of the @entity107 audience , a saturday 3pm kick - off makes much more sense than a sunday evening fixture			2
managers of teams in the @entity125 are forever asking for more help from the @entity0 when it comes to fixture scheduling			2
playing even later on a sunday would n't please the likes of @entity130 and @entity131 , especially if they have a big @entity133 tie coming up that week			0
another live game on a sunday would mean yet another one lost from the traditional saturday 3pm slot , which used to be the centrepiece of the football weekend			0
most @entity133 leagues , including @entity36 's @entity35 , schedule fixtures on a sunday night			1

sunday night fixture could be sold in addition to current rights *packages*
@entity0 could generate extra revenue from selling another game
current three - year deal between @entity6 and @entity7 ends in 2016
