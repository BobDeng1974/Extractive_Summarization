the stray dog was hit by a car , clubbed in the head and left for dead in a ditch in @entity4			1
days later , the one - year - old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm			1
now , the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good samaritans and veterinarians at @entity13			2
the dog , @entity23 , survived being run over , beaten with a hammer and buried , and now needs surgery heroic : @entity26 , a 1 - year - old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried , but she managed to dig herself out hanging on : a driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog			1
the dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing			1
the dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in @entity21 , a farm town about 100 miles west of @entity44			0
about a month ago , she was struck by a car			0
then things got worse : someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field			1
but the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved - in sinus cavity			0
the wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened , including the hammer blow			0
' i 'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery , ' said @entity68 , who learned about the dog 's plight on @entity71 and took the animal into her @entity21 home			0
she named the dog @entity23			1
recover : @entity23 is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding new lease of life : @entity26 , who truly rose from the grave , rarely stops wagging her tail back on all fours ! @entity23 's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity , which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend ' considering everything that she 's been through , she 's incredibly gentle and loving , ' @entity68 told @entity92			1
' she 's a true miracle dog , and she deserves a good life			0
' @entity23 is receiving care at @entity13 's @entity96 in @entity97			1
a ct scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages , restricting air flow into the lungs , said veterinary resident @entity105 , who 's assisting with @entity23 's treatment			1
it was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures			0
when @entity23 tries to draw air in through her nose , she 's forced to open her mouth to breathe instead			2
but with a dislocated jaw , that is challenging as well			0
@entity23 's jaw is healing on its own , but the nasal - bone fractures have caused lasting problems , @entity105 said			2
fixing that will require surgery to insert a stent , she said			0

so far , contributions have come from @entity21 , @entity13 and elsewhere ouch ! x-rays of @entity23 's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through the veterinary hospital 's @entity131 awarded $ 700 to help pay for @entity23 's early treatment			1
