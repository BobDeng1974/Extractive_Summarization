the @entity1 hotel in @entity2 used to be bedlam , but not through cavalier management , rebellious staff or disruptive guests			1
the @entity8 building that houses it is built on the site of @entity12 ’s first hospital for the mentally ill - the @entity13 , which opened in 1247 and was often pronounced as ‘ bedlam ’			1
fast forward a few centuries and in its place is a swanky , celebrity - baiting boutique hotel with 267 rooms - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists			1
and instead of mental health patients , it 's the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 that stay here these days			1
silence is golden : step into the @entity31 @entity1 lobby and you 're in a world of hushed swankery star guests : the likes of @entity28 ( right ) and @entity26 ( left ) are fans of the @entity31 @entity1 historic : @entity31 @entity1 is built on the site of @entity12 's first hospital for the mentally ill the striking thing about walking into the lobby is just how serene it is			1
despite its proximity to one of the country ’s busiest railway stations and the frenetic @entity49 road , the foyer is a place of almost temple - like peacefulness , as if hermetically sealed from the outside			1
‘ who turned off @entity2 ? ’ i ask my girlfriend as we walk in			0
the check - in system is very @entity58			1
the foyer does n’t have a reception , it has amiable youngsters swanning around with @entity62 , which you use to register			0
our room on the third floor matches the foyer in the hushed stakes , with the traffic noise quite marvellously suppressed			0
even emergency service sirens are little more than distant bleeps			0
the vibe in this large king room is minimalist chic , with two distinctive red @entity74 chairs and a sleek wooden desk with @entity77 lamp			1
but we ’ve chosen it for a certain bespoke flourish , for this is one of four rooms in the @entity31 which has been decorated by trendy artists			1
our room has a gigantic mural created by @entity86 and @entity87 called @entity88 plastered across one of the walls			2
the three other ‘ art rooms ’ contain works by @entity92 and his wife and collaborator @entity93 , design studio @entity95 and @entity97			2
art of the matter : @entity101 stays in the @entity31 's quirky @entity88 room , which features a huge mural by @entity86 and @entity87 big draw : @entity86 ( right ) and @entity87 ( left ) put the finishing touches on their amazing @entity88 picture creative : the @entity107 - also king - sized - features a flamboyant piece of art by @entity92 easel does it : internationally renowned @entity113 artist @entity97 reveals his @entity31 street art room - @entity115 multi-disciplinary @entity118 ’s @entity117 street art room will also appeal to those who fancy a quirky twist to their stay one day walk is a celebration of the hotel ’s east side locale , documenting a nine - hour walk the artists took that began with breakfast at @entity130 and wound its way past @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , of flower - market fame			1
it ’s a jumble of sketches , ponderings and quotes from overheard conversations that some might find a bit overwhelming , but we find mesmerising			2
a work of art that adds a splash of attitude and intrigue to a room with low - key aesthetics			2
the room ’s other major talking point is the bed			0
it ’s simply magnificently huge and comfortable , seemingly spanning multiple postcodes			0
there ’s a lot of floor space , too			0
i ’m tempted to zig - zag my way to the bathroom to extract maximum value from it			2
delightful design : the @entity31 @entity1 features a knowing nod to @entity167 's @entity166 suite deal : the @entity31 also contains bigger rooms with a living - room set - up there is also an @entity173 dock , which would have been spiffing … if we had ipods			1
the @entity31 should really invest in some @entity177 - capable sound systems as mobile phones tend to be the portable music system of choice these days			1
the aforementioned en - suite , meanwhile , is strikingly swish , with floor - to - ceiling tiling , a deep bath and turbo - charged power shower			2
room inspection over , it ’s time to explore the rest of the hotel			2
the @entity31 has made the business of sauntering around inside all the more pleasant by dispersing a zesty fragrance through diffusers and , i 'm told , courtesy of housekeeping staff armed with sprays			1
it 's called ' @entity196 ' and was created specifically for the hotel by a company called @entity198 , which claims it ' relaxes and renews '			1
this aroma wafts around rather pleasing aesthetics			0
the hotel opened as @entity202 in 1884 and was given a @entity204 makeover in 2000 after it had fallen into disrepair			2
the result is most eye - catching , with a postmodern , sleek interior contrasting markedly with the redbrick exterior			2
a highlight is the soaring six - storey - high atrium and a winning nod to the @entity166 built into the ' spine ' of the hotel that joins the old part with a newer section			1
guests looking up as they walk to the lifts in the foyer will notice the walkways above have been sculpted to imitate the @entity167 museum ’s world - famous spiral design			1
the refurb , meanwhile , revealed something rather intriguing and @entity225 - a @entity227 @entity226 hidden behind a fake wall			2
built using 12 types of @entity232 marble and mahogany panelling , it was considered one of the grandest @entity236 temples of its time			2
masons began using it again for meetings when it was uncovered and while it 's not open to guests , this ornate room can be hired by the public , with wine tastings and wedding receptions popular bookings			1
our appetite for the mysterious sated , it 's time to dine			0
mysterious : when the hotel was refurbished in 2000 builders found this incredible @entity255 behind a fake wall			0
today it is available for hire flaming brilliant : once a month the @entity31 hosts a candle - lit dinner in its 1901 restaurant tasty : the standard of cooking at the @entity31 is stunning and the setting truly relaxing food , glorious food : the presentation of the dishes at 1901 is stunning			1
pictured is a crab starter casual : breakfast and brunch is served at the @entity31 's @entity273 cafe , where the atmosphere is more informal brute of a breakfast : the full @entity12 option at @entity273 will satisfy the hungriest of customers dinner at the @entity31 , in its 1901 restaurant , is truly an experience to savour			1
feeding takes place in a space that ’s almost other worldly , a grand high - ceilinged room containing huge @entity289 - style pillars , gigantic potted plants that only @entity291 could lift and a central block brimming with cocktail - making juices , as one of side of the room functions as a bar			0
the setting is enhanced because it 's 1901 ’s @entity299 night which takes place on the last wednesday of every month			1
three hundred and fifty candles are lit and placed around the room for added dreaminess			0
the food quality is equally impressive			0
it 's so beautifully presented you could call it art , frame it and hang it			0
i savour a delicious crab starter with cucumber , grapefruit and blackberry jelly ( £ 14 ) followed by a brilliantly executed beef fillet with potato cake , oxtail spring roll , stilton beignet , carrot and courgette puree ( £ 29 )			0
a glass of 2006 @entity325 @entity324 / merlot from @entity326 complements it marvellously			0
brunch the next day in the hotel 's @entity273 diner is far more casual , but memorable all the same			1
the @entity332 bar there is a great idea , but i summon a revitalising oatmeal and banana smoothie and a dreadnought of an @entity12 breakfast served in a huge roll from an interesting and fun @entity167 - style menu			0
it 's delicious but i feel anchored to my seat , so it 's time to abandon the tranquillity of the @entity31 and follow in the footsteps of @entity345 and @entity87 through the streets of the @entity347 to walk it off			1
rooms at @entity349 start at £ 180			0
@entity352 large @entity351 rooms available to book from £ 378 on weekdays ( sunday to thursday night ) and £ 252 on weekends ( friday & saturday ) , subject to availability			0
