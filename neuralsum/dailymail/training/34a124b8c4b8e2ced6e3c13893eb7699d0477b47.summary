by @entity0 elected officials and rumored 2016 presidential candidates descended upon @entity3 , @entity4 , today to woo progressive activists at the annual @entity7 conference			1
but one high - profile , political figure is noticeably missing from the fray : @entity11			2
@entity12 has not attended the gathering since 2007 when she was competing in the @entity15 primary for president , and conference organizers said she declined an invitation to speak this year			1
the former secretary of state opted to spend the week promoting her book , instead , holding book signings in @entity22 and @entity23			1
this afternoon she sat down with @entity24 in his @entity26 office for an hour long interview that will air tonight on @entity28			0
@entity11 , pictured here on @entity30 with @entity31 on tuesday , put promoting her book ahead of speaking to progressive activists at a gathering this week in @entity3 republicans lept to criticize @entity11 's absence from the 3,000 person gathering as further proof that the 2016 frontrunner is out of touch with her base			1
' @entity11 is just too busy on her book tour to take time out for the @entity7 conference in @entity3 but with all of the news about how the @entity45 have struggled financially , we get it , money first , even as colleges dole out millions to hear her speak despite rising tuition costs , ' @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said , touching on @entity11 's recent gaffes			1
' sounds like she ’ll have to find another occasion to try to placate the liberal left as @entity55 and @entity56 make their 2016 plays after seeing an opening with @entity11 ’s book tour stumbles and her 2016 moves echoing her failed 2008 campaign			1
' however , conference attendees said they were n't offended she did n't make speaking to them a priority this year			0
' i think she ’s obviously a very busy woman , ' said @entity65 , a organizer with @entity66 in the @entity3 area who described herself a @entity11 supporter			2
' it 's her loss , ' said another attendee , adding that it 's too early in the election cycle to ' harangue ' @entity12 for skipping the gathering			1
@entity7 spokeswoman @entity75 told @entity76 she 's ' not surprised ' @entity11 did n't attend again this year because ' she has not declared yet			1
' ' most of the events that she ’s doing are pretty benign non-political events , ' @entity75 continued			0
the @entity81 resident pointed out that @entity82 for @entity11 had a substantial presence at the conference as a sponsor of both the conference itself and both a @entity88 - themed party on friday evening			1
it also provided attendees with coffee during a snack break this morning			0
‘ her team knows that she has a presence here , and regardless of whether or not it fits her schedule , she ’s still got a presence here , ' @entity75 said			0
' the @entity98 folks know what they ’re doing			0
’ asked for a comment on it 's chosen candidate 's absence from the conference today , @entity98 spokesman @entity104 told @entity76 in an email , ' we 're just thrilled to be a part of @entity7 and thrilled to be a co-sponsor of this amazing gathering			1
' @entity11 's support from progressives across the country - who are the backbone of our more than 2.5 million supporters - has been absolutely inspiring , ' he said			1
a spokesman for @entity12 did not respond to a request for comment on @entity12 's decision to skip the conference			1
@entity15 presidential hopefuls @entity11 , left , and @entity123 , right , participate in the @entity125 's @entity124 in @entity126 in 2007			1
@entity12 has not attended , @entity125 , now called @entity7 , since that debate while @entity7 attendees said they would still vote for @entity11 if she were the @entity15 nominee in 2016 , it 's no secret that @entity130 senator @entity55 is most activists ' candidate of choice			1
' her values are consistent with what i believe and what a lot of people here believe , ' said @entity139 , executive director of @entity140 , a @entity141 based organization that advocates for the fair treatment of workers and provides legal advice on worker ’s rights			0
@entity147 spoke at the conference in 2012 in person as a candidate , and gave a video address as a lawmaker last year			2
this year she is slated to give the keynote speech on friday morning			0
' it ’s really good to have the affirmation of someone that high [ up ] in a position of power who ’s saying all the right things , ' @entity139 gushed			0
' i would love it , ' she replied when asked how she felt about @entity147 's potential presidential run			2
as one attendee noted , @entity11 has a ' troubled ' relationship with the left wing of the @entity15			1
the former first lady and her husband are seen as too moderate for many progressives ' taste and their willingness to accept large sums of money from the ' too big to fail ' financial crowd is concerning to @entity177 activists			0
' from my perspective it ’s problematic , ' @entity179 resident @entity178 said , referring to the millions of dollars @entity182 and @entity11 have received from the financial industry to speak at events			1
' you have to wonder who a politician is beholden to if they ’re getting all their money from people who are giving it in huge chunks , ' @entity178 said			0
' so i ’m worried about that			0
' ‘ if she gets elected , we ’re going to have to continuously poke her to make sure that she stays to the left			0
' @entity139 said @entity11 may be avoiding the conference because she thinks kissing up to progressive activists is a waste of her time			1
‘ i think that she might say , " well look , i ’m not gon na win over this crowd			0
" ' ' i ca n’t imagine being enough of an activist to want to come to this conference and not having an opinion about @entity11 , ' @entity139 said			1
' this is not a persuadable audience			0
' another attendee , @entity207 , a @entity208 , @entity209 , resident who described himself as ‘ left of @entity210 , ’ said progressives are ' either going to vote for her or not if she ’s the candidate , regardless of what she says or does , ' so @entity11 may as well continue ignoring the party 's base			1
' i mean it does n’t matter if she comes here or not for 95 percent of the people , ' he said			0
' i will vote her with no reservations if she is the @entity15 candidate			2
i will vote for whoever is the @entity15 candidate			2
' however , @entity223 , associate publisher of @entity224 , a website that covers the gay community , said @entity11 will need the grassroots activists who attend this conference to have her back if she wants to make it that far in the first place			2
‘ if you want to build a grassroots network for any @entity15 primary , these are the people you definitely need to rely on , ' he said			2
‘ i ’m disappointed that she ’s not [ here ]			0
' ' this is the largest , liberal , progressive gathering of activists around the country , so you ’d think she would ’ve made an attempt to be here			2
’ if @entity11 runs for office and does n't attend next year , however , netroots - goers said they would n't let her off the hook so easily			0
' if she ’s running next year and even if she ’s the frontrunner and seems to be the only one , she needs the progressive turnout , ' said seven - year @entity7 veteran @entity247			0
' she should be here			0

@entity7 is the largest annual gathering of progressives
*presumed* 2016 presidential candidate @entity11 was invited to speak but declined
@entity12 opted to spend this week promoting her book @entity254 instead
the last time she addressed the conference was in 2007 when she was trying to win attendee 's support in the @entity15 presidential primary
