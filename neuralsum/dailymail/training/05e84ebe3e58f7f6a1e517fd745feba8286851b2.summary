after every @entity1 game at @entity2 , when @entity4 's post-match duties are almost done , a separate huddle forms around the country 's head coach			1
in these precious moments the soundbites that immediately follow a 5 - 0 victory over @entity10 are designed to give way to some reasoned and considered thoughts in the wider context of the national team 's development			1
@entity4 speaks passionately about a group of players who are young , ambitious and upwardly mobile			1
many of those travelling to @entity22 for sunday 's @entity24 qualifier in @entity25 have been sourced from the @entity26 , as @entity4 still respectfully refers to the north @entity27			1
@entity28 , one of five @entity26 players in the @entity1 squad , celebrates scoring against @entity10 @entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) both started for the @entity1 against @entity10 @entity4 is pleased to see a group of @entity26 players forcing their way into his plans for @entity24 five representatives — @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity38 , @entity28 and substitute @entity39 — were on the field at the start of the second half against @entity10			1
in a few weeks ' time , when @entity1 prepare for a @entity24 qualifier against @entity45 and a feisty friendly with @entity47 , that figure could reach six if @entity48 is back from injury			2
' it was not long ago that we had five @entity53 players , but it 's nice to see people like @entity39 and @entity38 really starting to reach the potential that i know @entity58 always believed they had , ' revealed @entity4			1
historically , the dressings room of international teams are packed with players from their country 's top clubs			2
midfielders @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 ( right ) will both be hoping to start against @entity22 take @entity65 's success at the @entity66 in @entity67 last summer			1
@entity68 boasted six players — @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 — in the starting line - up against @entity77			1
@entity78 , another player from @entity68 , came off the substitutes ' bench to score @entity65 's winner in extra-time			1
two years previously , when @entity84 won @entity85 with victory over @entity87 in the final , @entity83 started with five players from @entity90 and four from @entity91			1
@entity39 , who created two of @entity1 's second - half goals after coming on at the interval , believes the familiarity with his @entity26 team - mates benefits the national team			1
he said : ' when you play week - in - week - out and then bring that to international football , it does really help in gelling the team together			2
' the @entity103 and the @entity104 have been able to do that			0
when you go and watch @entity84 play it 's almost like watching @entity90 or @entity91 play at the times , with the number of players on the pitch			2
@entity65 started with six @entity68 players as they won the @entity66 final against @entity77 @entity84 's starting @entity114 in the @entity85 final was made up of nine players from @entity91 and @entity90 ' it is a nice thing to have that with @entity26 at the moment			1
@entity53 have got a good number of players as well			2
it 's not just those two clubs , everyone who comes away gels well — hopefully it will help us be successful			0
you know their characteristics and where they 're going to pass and where they like the ball to be passed			0
' when i got that ball down the line i knew @entity31 ( @entity135 ) was going to be able to find me first and foremost and i knew that @entity28 likes to make that run to the front post			1
' @entity22 vs @entity1 probable teams of course , let 's remember that the opposition so far this season have comprised @entity142 ( beaten by @entity45 on thursday ) and @entity10 ( beaten by everybody )			1
@entity4 has focused on youth for this campaign , turning to the emerging talent in the country as @entity1 head towards the finals in @entity150 in june 2016			1
at @entity151 on tuesday , when @entity4 was a man short for the session he wanted to put on , he sent for @entity154 midfielder @entity153 from @entity156 's @entity155			2
it gave @entity153 a glimpse of the future , showing the youngster what is in front of him if he continues to develop as a player with @entity1 's junior teams			2
blooding these players could yet be @entity4 's legacy			2
' realistically this team is mostly 21 or 22			0
people will tell me they do n't reach their best until they are 27 or 28 so perhaps not			0
' a , i want to win matches and b , plan for the future			0
i am picking people i think can do the job			0
a good example of that is @entity135			0
here is a guy who played a few times for the @entity181 , jumped straight over the @entity155 and went into the first team			0
' that is a great pat on the back for our development system			0
i know not everyone agrees with this , but the pragmatic reason you have development teams is to get into the first team			0
you are an under 21 player because you want to be a senior player			0
we did n't know how @entity194 would turn out a year ago to the player he is today			0
@entity154 midfielder @entity153 ( centre ) , pictured in training with @entity1 's under 21 squad , was given the chance to train with the senior squad by @entity4 @entity4 has been impressed with @entity135 ' rapid progression to his senior squad ' we did not know the early days of @entity203 at @entity53 that he would become the player he is			1
we did n't know @entity205 would kick on			0
' i have been lucky enough to be there when it happened and i suppose , bright enough to realise that i do n't have to hang my hat on 30 - year - olds			0
if these guys are that good , i can put them in the team			0
' as ever , the acid test for this team will be tournament football .			0

@entity28 , @entity32 , @entity31 and @entity38 all started in the 5 - 0 win against @entity10
@entity39 came off the bench and impressed
@entity26 have more players in the @entity1 squad than any other club
@entity4 believes his young @entity224 are starting to reach their potential and have plenty more to give
@entity39 is *confident* that playing together at club level will improve their *performances* for the national side
@entity65 won the @entity233 with six @entity68 players in their starting xi against @entity77 in the final
