' sir @entity15 , president of the @entity16 , quashed the conviction			1
@entity18 , 30 ( left ) had his murder conviction quashed at the @entity13 after serving 12 years in prison for the killing of @entity8 , 18 ( right )			1
mr @entity6 is pictured leaving @entity22 's appeal court today he said ' new expert analysis of the evidence ' might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury			1
' mr @entity6 was convicted in 2001 at @entity27 and sentenced to life in prison in 2002 , with a minimum term of 12 years			1
he was released on life licence last year			1
mr @entity8 , who had never been in trouble with the police , was shot as he chatted to friends in the street in 2001 and was found collapsed in an alleyway			1
@entity37 was also wounded in the hand by shots fired from the same gun			0
two days later the teenager had been due to give evidence at a trial of the killing of his friend @entity45 , 16 , who was stabbed to death in @entity48 in january 2001			2
mr @entity6 , formerly of @entity49 , was a member of the @entity48 gang and was found guilty of mr @entity8 's murder and charges of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life			1
he was convicted on the basis of gunshot residue which was found but has always maintained his innocence			0
in 2004 he submitted an appeal in 2004 which failed			0
the @entity63 ( @entity63 ) referred the murder conviction to the @entity13 for a second time earlier this year , based on new scientific evidence and an analysis of the case by students at @entity70			1
they were working on the @entity71 , which aims to help people who they believe have been wrongly convicted			0
after his conviction was quashed @entity74 , 51 , insisted mr @entity6 knew the identity of her son 's killer and should name the culprit			1
she said : it has left me feeling sick			0
@entity6 has now claimed to be a reformed man			2
if that is true he should tell the police who did this			0
' he has said that he is a mature adult			0
if that 's true he should give the names of those responsible to the police			0
it 's his so - called friends that should have saved him , not the appeal court			2
' he should tell the police who pulled the trigger			0
' judges at the @entity13 in @entity22 quashed mr @entity6 's conviction for the murder back in 2001 ms @entity103 said mr @entity6 had previously said a group of his friends had been involved			1
she added : ' there is no appeal available for my son 's life			2
no amount of time will ever fix the heartbreak that my family continue to suffer each and everyday			0
' mrs @entity103 said she did n't even know that the appeal court hearing was due to be heard today			0
she said @entity118 and the @entity119 did n't let her know and added : ' i heard about it from a friend who sent me a text after seeing it on the news			0
' @entity6 said at the time that there was a code - that you did n't grass on your friends			2
but he has now said that he is a grown - up			0
well if he is a grown - up he should tell what he knows			0
' @entity8 was an innocent 18 - year - old boy that never had any dealings with gangsters , gangs , drugs or territory wars			1
' sir @entity15 , sitting with mr @entity140 and mr @entity141 , expressed the court 's ' gratitude ' to the @entity63 for the part it had played in the appeal			1
he also paid tribute ' to the work of the @entity71 and @entity149 at @entity150 , which took up the appellant 's case and pursued it so diligently '			0
the judge described how the @entity63 obtained its own scientific evidence and referred @entity6 's case to the appeal court on the grounds that there was ' a real possibility ' that the evidence of gunshot residue ' does not now attract the value attributed to it at trial , and therefore does not support the identification evidence '			1
the @entity63 also questioned the admissibility of voice identification evidence			0
sir @entity15 said mr @entity6 's conviction was no longer safe because of new scientific evidence mr @entity6 originally stood trial accused with three others - @entity172 , his brother @entity173 , and @entity174			1
before the trial , @entity175 pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life , possessing ammunition without a certificate , and assisting offenders			0
he went on to give evidence for the prosecution			0
@entity173 changed his plea of not guilty to guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life			0
he was sentenced to five years in a young offenders ' institution			2
@entity172 , who relied on an alibi for his defence , was acquitted of murder and attempted murder but convicted of wounding with intent			2
that conviction was later quashed for being ' inconsistent ' with the acquittals , but he was sentenced to eight years ' detention - reduced to seven years on appeal - for possession of a firearm with intent			1
sir @entity15 said the prosecution case was that @entity6 and @entity172 were responsible for the shooting , using a @entity207 self - loading pistol which was recovered from @entity175 's house			1
the judge said the background to the shooting was witness evidence all leading to the inference that it was the outcome of gang rivalry			2
the evidence against @entity6 was that gunshot residue had been found on a black @entity219 hooded jacket found under the stairs at his home			2
subsequent analysis found that it bore four particles of gunshot residue , and the prosecution said this was evidence supporting the assertion that @entity6 was the gunman			2
the current appeal was primarily based on a scientific re-evaluation of the significance of gunshot residue generally			0
mr @entity6 's defence argued that the particles could have come from sources other than the shooting			1
years after his conviction , the @entity234 ( @entity234 ) had issued new guidelines in july 2006 on ' the assessment , interpretation and reporting of firearms chemistry cases ' , said the judge			0
this document dealt with the prevalence of small numbers of particles of gunshot residue ' with the result , so it is argued , that the number and type of particles of residue found on the coat were so small so as to be at or near the level at which they could not be considered to have evidential value			0
' sir @entity15 said that , had the present scientific concerns raised in the appeal court been available to the trial judge , his directions to the jury ' would have been couched in terms of much greater circumspection and caution '			1
he said : ' the particles of gunshot residue may well be consistent with the appellant 's participation in the murder but , at the very least , the extent ( if it got that far ) to which they could provide positive corroboration would now have required much more detailed analysis of the science and the evidence			2
' he said the conviction was no longer safe because the new evidence might reasonably have affected the trial jury 's decision .			1
