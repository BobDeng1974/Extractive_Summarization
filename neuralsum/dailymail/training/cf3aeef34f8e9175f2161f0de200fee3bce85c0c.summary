@entity0 was at it again on saturday – conducting the crowd as his team made fools of their richer rivals @entity5			1
his achievements at @entity7 have been little short of astounding at times but could he really transfer the magic to @entity11 ? here , @entity12 looks at the pros and cons of hiring one of the most charismatic , occasionally combustible , and highly successful coaches in football			1
@entity7 boss @entity0 has been linked with the manager 's role at @entity11 @entity20 ( left ) and his @entity7 team - mates celebrate during the 4 - 0 win against @entity5 just what city need ? how many times have @entity11 looked long on talent but short on belief and passion ? speaking on @entity31 radio last week @entity29 boss @entity28 said they were ‘ the most gifted team in the league ’ but that @entity34 ‘ did more with less ’			1
@entity0 is the master of motivation			1
he lifts his players for big games like the @entity39 final in 2013 when he beat @entity40 ’s @entity5 at the @entity41 , and in the @entity42 the year before when he beat @entity44 's @entity43			1
but he can also maintain that energy throughout a whole season ? @entity7 ’s players always believed they had a chance in the @entity49 last season because over two legs they feel they are a match for anyone			1
but they doubted that in a 38 - game season they could really get the better of the superior squads of @entity5 and @entity55			2
and yet , @entity0 convinced them , and they won the most difficult competition of the lot			2
if what @entity11 need is a little more passion then @entity61 ’s mr @entity60 could be @entity64 's perfect successor			1
@entity0 's side claimed the @entity42 in 2012 after beating @entity43 in the final in @entity67 @entity68 with 12 points already dropped at home , teams do n’t go to the @entity72 with fear and it should n’t be that way against the league champions			1
in @entity61 in contrast , nobody wants to go to the @entity79 where @entity5 have already lost three times this season			2
but much of that comes from the special bond that exists between @entity0 and the @entity86 supporters - something that would be difficult to replicate in @entity88			1
he turned up in high regard as a former captain and double winner and in any player - manager dispute he will always have the 60,000 home fans on his side			2
that instant loyalty would not be available to him away from @entity5			0
he probably would n’t get away with having his son @entity96 as a ball - boy jumping into his arms whenever @entity11 scored			1
he could try to bring the old @entity100 passion back to @entity101 , but he would have to get the team playing well first before anyone started jumping up and down to the tune of ' @entity105 ! @entity105 ! @entity105 ! @entity0 '			2
@entity64 has struggled with @entity11 at the @entity72 in recent weeks @entity0 would have to get used to not having 60,000 fans chanting his name at first to build and rebuild last summer he had to watch @entity109 go back to parent club @entity34 and @entity110 and @entity111 follow him to @entity112			1
he did n’t complain , just built another indestructible side that plays exactly the same way			0
on saturday in the derby he had midfield journeymen like @entity117 and @entity118 out - performing @entity120 winners like @entity121 and @entity122			2
under his wing @entity123 has emerged as one of the best central defenders in @entity127			0
@entity20 – lost at @entity128 – has found his best form again			0
and he can handle big signings too as the success of the £ 22.2m acquisition @entity133 and previously @entity134 prove			0
he would have no problem working with @entity11 sporting director @entity136 and making the transfers work			2
@entity139 's big - money signing proves @entity0 can handle himself in the transfer market @entity134 also impressed after joining @entity7 under the @entity141 the language barrier @entity0 speaks very little @entity143			1
and even if he learned the language quickly something would inevitably be lost in translation			0
part of the spell he casts over supporters and staff alike comes from the way he expresses himself			0
speaking through an interpreter as @entity28 did in his first season or in the broken sentences of a novice , some of the power of his message would be watered down			2
his fitness coach , the brilliant @entity159 , would have similar problems as would his trusted no 2 @entity161			0
it would certainly be an obstacle , but not an insurmountable one			0
tactics forget the idea his teams do n't play football			0
@entity5 were played off the park on saturday with flicks , tricks and bicycle - kicks all part of the show			2
his teams are compact when defending and attack as a unit but he is bold enough to take chances when the time is right to do so			0
@entity134 and @entity110 have enjoyed playing for him			0
he wants defensive solidity but full backs can overlap as @entity182 did in the @entity5 derby to make the second goal			0
he 's not a fan of possession for possession 's sake			0
he 's even said that too much of it can be a negative because it allows the opposition to regroup			0
he likes to hurt teams with the ball , not just have it for the sake of it			0
it 's a philosophy that fits the @entity198 perfectly			0
@entity123 celebrates after scoring against @entity55 in @entity61 last season as @entity7 won the title a gamble @entity201 ? it would be fun finding out seeing the @entity204 in the dugout going up against @entity206 or @entity40 , @entity207 or @entity208 would give the @entity198 a shot in the arm , the like of which it has n’t had since the self - proclaimed @entity211 first showed up in 2004			1
@entity0 ’s high energy man - management would shake up the @entity11 dressing room , his high - intenstiy football would shake up the league , and his touchline passion would shake up the fourth official from time to time			1
it would n’t be without its glitches – the team - talks might have to be delivered via @entity222 at first – but it would be a rollercoaster ride and if this season comes to a crawling climax with no trophies you could see why it might be one @entity11 's power - brokers might want to take			1
@entity230 clashes with @entity231 of @entity5 during last year 's @entity49 final meetings between @entity0 and @entity34 would be tasty - as this picture with @entity40 proves			1

@entity0 has been linked with the manager 's role at @entity11
@entity0 's @entity7 beat rivals real 4 - 0 on saturday
the @entity141 boss is a *fantastic* man motivator and is passionate
@entity7 beat the odds to claim the @entity31 title last season
@entity0 has *history* with @entity34 manager @entity40
