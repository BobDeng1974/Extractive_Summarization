loom bands may have been 2014 ’s bracelet of choice , but take a look around any office , gym , or @entity6 today and you ’ll spot another kind of rubber bracelet			1
unlike the purely decorative loom band , these sleek rubber bands — some with a watch - like face , some just a simple bracelet — have a function			1
acting like mini personal trainers , these high - tech pedometers register calories burned , steps taken , distance travelled and even how well you ’ve slept , handily logging all of the data on to an app on your smartphone			1
by 2018 , it ’s estimated that 130 million fitness trackers will have been sold worldwide — and they ’re particularly popular in the @entity39 , with more @entity39 wearing one than in any other country in @entity42			1
but sales figures are n’t the only things on the up			0
a growing body of rather worrying research suggests that , when it comes to counting calories , some of these high - tech , high - priced gadgets — which start at around £ 80 and can cost several hundreds of pounds — could , in fact , be completely wide of the mark			1
@entity25 ( pictured ) was put through different exercises to see if the fitness trackers she were accurate just last week , a study by @entity59 in the @entity60 , revealed some of the bands could overestimate wearers ’ calorie burn by as much as 40 per cent — a huge margin of error when you ’re trying to work out how many calories you should be consuming			1
could this be why a raft of dieters on weight - loss forums across the web are joining discussions entitled such things as ‘ my @entity76 [ one of the most popular brands ] is making me fat ! ’ with tales of gaining , rather than losing , pounds ? as someone who has become a devotee of the gadgets over the past six months , i did n’t want to believe the stories			2
@entity25 completed the tests at @entity85 with dr @entity86 who measured her breath to get acute results as the editor of the women ’s health website healthista.com , i get sent new health products to test every day			1
after a stint trialling the @entity94 + @entity95 ( £ 89 , nike.com ) — dubbed the a-list fitness accessory by @entity97 , no less — i had become obsessive about tracking my calories and steps , and competing with myself to increase my daily activity			1
but despite my slavish devotion to the technology , even i had begun to have my doubts			0
after a trialling the @entity104 , @entity25 ( pictured ) become obsessive about tracking calories and steps , and competing with herself to increase her daily activity recently , i was sent another new tracker — the @entity110 ( £ 79.95 , johnlewis.com )			1
one day , i wore both the @entity111 and the @entity104 while doing my regular 30 - minute morning workout and 25 - minute walk to work			2
but when i arrived at work , i noticed the @entity111 said that i ’d burned 250 calories more than the @entity95 said i had			0
which to believe ? i asked the manufacturers of both if they could send me studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers			0
which is when i discovered that , actually , there is n’t much evidence out there at all			0
@entity25 appealed to the companies that produce the fitness trackers to ask if they could provide her with studies conducted by the companies proving the accuracy of their trackers , but they did n't and she discovered there is n't much evidence available to prove the accuracy of the bands ‘ there ’s little published data from manufacturers on the validity of these fitness monitors , ’ says @entity139 , professor of kinesiology at @entity59 , who has conducted trials on fitness monitors , which also showed wide inaccuracies between their readings			1
reluctant to give up my fitness tracker addiction , i decided to put them to the test myself , pitting my @entity95 against the other most popular models on the market — the @entity155 ( £ 99.99 , jawbone.com / up ) , the @entity156 ( £ 79.99 , fitbit.com / uk / flex ) , the @entity157 ( £ 99.99 , buy.garmin.com ) and the @entity158 ( £ 268.99 , kiperformance.co.uk )			1
i began by wearing all six bands at once for a day to see how much of a difference they would show in calories burned — the main thing most of us are worried about when it comes to tracking activity			1
initally @entity25 wore all six bands to see the figures they came up with for the same activities , she found the calorie counters varied widely between all six of them after my morning workout , my walk to and from work ( 25 minutes each way ) and spending the rest of the day typing at my desk , the results ranged from 1,591 calories burned ( the @entity155 ) to a staggering 2,196 ( the @entity111 )			1
that ’s a difference of 605 calories that i might , or might not , be burning — or more than 4,000 calories a week , around the same number you need to cut out to lose an entire pound of fat ! it was a huge and alarming discrepancy , i had to admit			0
so , why was it happening ? @entity25 visited the lab of @entity191 , professor of sport , health and exercise science at the @entity85 , where she was measured by his @entity196 ( @entity195 ) machine @entity197 , a fitness trainer and author of the pop - up gym , has tested countless fitness trackers , and explains that most of them use something called an accelerometer — essentially a motion sensor — which registers your movements and feeds them into the device			1
using this information , your personal calorie expenditure is then calculated using the average burn of other people of your weight and height , making it a lot less scientific than you might think			0
some are clearly more sophisticated than others			0
in order to work out which was the most accurate , i visited the lab of @entity191 , professor of sport , health and exercise science at the @entity85 , to be measured by his @entity196 ( @entity195 ) machine			1
the results that came back from the experiment showed some areas where there were massive differences between the readings given by the different fitness bands this involves wearing a mask that analyses the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your breath — the universally recognised gold standard technique for calculating calorie burn			1
wearing the @entity195 mask and each of my six bands , i carried out four different activities , with different levels of intensity and ranges of movement , for eight minutes each — walking on a treadmill ; cycling on a stationary bike ; sitting at a computer , typing ; and packing groceries — to see how they stacked up			2
all the numbers represent calories burned in the eight minutes			0
here are the surprising results			2
as you can see from the table , the results were not exactly impressive			2
for each of the activities , i ranked the trackers according to how accurate they were			2
the @entity157 came first or second in all our tests , with the exception of cycling — where it wildly underestimated the number of calories i ’d expended			0
although i ’d always far prefer that something underestimated than overestimated calories burned , lulling you into a false sense of security and giving you licence to over-eat			0
in fact , the @entity157 only thought i ’d burned more calories than i actually had during one test , the typing test — if i was typing , as i often do , for eight hours , i would think i ’d burned 960 calories when i ’d only really have burned 600			2
‘ every device will have some room for error , ’ says professor @entity191 , although he points out that our trial was n’t as controlled as a proper research experiment			0
that said , i would n’t invest in the @entity110 , which overestimated my calorie burn in almost every task — by more than 700 per cent in one case			0
this experiment has made me question my devotion to fitness trackers			2
i ’m not the only one			0
recent research found that although sales are on the up , like gym memberships , they ’re soon ditched , with a third of people abandoning theirs after only six months			0
i ’m going back to that simple equation of moving more and eating less			0
it ’s low - tech — but at least i know it works .			0

@entity25 has tested out the newest trend seen on *joggers* and gym - goers across the country
she took on the *challenge* to see how accurate the fitness bands are
@entity25 was put to the test at the @entity85 where her activity was measured and the results from the bands were compared
