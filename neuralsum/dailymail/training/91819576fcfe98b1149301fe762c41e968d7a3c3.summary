by @entity0 @entity1 should be split up , with their employment arms forced to compete against private sector and voluntary providers and the remaining services rebranded as @entity6 , a think - tank has recommended			0
under the plan , the employment services arm would be mutualised , while the remaining part of @entity11 would be expanded and renamed to reduce the ' stigma ' attached to it			2
the right - of - centre @entity13 said just over a third ( 36 per cent ) of people using jobcentres find sustained work , with many finding themselves in and out of employment largely due to having barriers to work which are not fully dealt with			1
the @entity13 think - tank report says that only 36 per cent of people who use a @entity11 find a regular job ( file photo ) the report said that the government ’s welfare reforms have improved matters , but there is still too much duplication and inefficiency in the system			1
the think - tank said private companies and charities should compete with government agencies to help people into work , with personal budgets for jobseekers to give them greater control over allocation of funding to employment support providers			2
citizen support would act as a central hub for government services , enabling advisers to identify an individual ’s specific barriers to work and suggest providers that could help meet their needs			0
the adviser would also show the success rate of each provider using comparison data to help the jobseeker make a more informed decision			0
the report ’s author , @entity59 , said : ' the way public services are currently structured means that often a jobseeker ends up being passed from pillar to post			0
this is confusing for the individual , creates barriers to help them into work and is expensive			0
' services have improved enormously , but there is still a lot more to do			0
' what is needed is a radical overhaul of the system which puts the needs of the jobseeker first			0
the very word jobcentre comes with a stigma			0
the @entity80 said @entity11 conducts 98,000 adviser interviews every day ' instead of attaching labels to people who are not in work we should reform the system to make it as easy as possible for individuals , who often have multiple problems , to work with an organisation that is best suited to helping them into work			1
' the @entity80 said @entity11 conducts 98,000 adviser interviews , processes 18,000 working - age benefit claims and answers 197,100 calls in contact centres every working day			1
the 36 per cent figure was based on research from 2011 , and the labour market has changed substantially since then , a spokesman from the @entity80 said a spokesman said : ' an important milestone has been reached in our country ’s recovery			1
with one of the highest employment rates ever and more people in work than ever before , it ’s clear that the government ’s long - term economic plan to help businesses create jobs and get people working again is the right one			1
' however , we know there is always more to do , which is why our @entity11 staff work hard every day to help people off benefits and into work			1
' and our @entity122 - which is run by private providers who are paid by results - is helping more people than any programme before , with more than half a million people having started a job and 300,000 moved into lasting work			2
' the 36 per cent figure was based on research from 2011 , and the labour market has changed substantially since then , the department added .			2
