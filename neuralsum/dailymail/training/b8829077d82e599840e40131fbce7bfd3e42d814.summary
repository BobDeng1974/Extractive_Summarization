angry : @entity0 , who recently retired after 30 years in the @entity1 , said it was a ' nonsense incident ' that spiralled out of control and accused others of ' jumping on the bandwagon ' the senior pc on duty on @entity8 during @entity10 's ' toxic ' ' f * * * * * * pleb ' outburst said today he felt sorry for the mp and criticised @entity13 's handling of the case			1
@entity0 , who recently retired after 30 years in the @entity1 , said it was a ' nonsense incident ' that spiralled out of control			1
no - one should have lost their job over what happened at the gates of @entity8 and the @entity21 ' jumped on the bandwagon ' , using the incident as a ' hook to hang their grievances on ' , he said			1
he also criticised @entity1 commissioner sir @entity28 's handling of the affair : ' i was a lowly pc			1
i think he could have done more at the time , but who am i to say that			0
' mr @entity0 also said that the commissioner 's letter in response to his complaints was ' not worth the stamp '			1
earlier he told the @entity38 this week the ' @entity40 ' row was ' just a quirky incident with a gentleman on a bicycle who had the hump '			0
yesterday high court judge decided that former chief whip mr @entity10 did call pc @entity47 a ' pleb ' because the officer did not have the ' wit , imagination or inclination ' to invent it			1
mr @entity53 said he had reached the ' firm conclusion ' that the 58 - year - old mp used the ' politically - toxic ' word in @entity8 that evening in september 2012 when he was not allowed to cycle through the main vehicle gates			0
mr @entity10 , who resigned as whip a month after the altercation , vehemently denied during his two - week libel action against @entity61 ( @entity61 ) that he had said : ' best you learn your f * * * * * * place - you do n't run this f * * * * * * government - you 're f * * * * * * plebs			2
' he said he would never call a policeman a pleb ' let alone a f * * * * * * pleb ' although he agreed he muttered audibly under his breath ' i thought you lot were supposed to f * * * * * * help us ' - but not directed at the officer			0
mr @entity10 , who now faces a hefty legal bill , said he was ' bitterly disappointed ' with the ruling			2
ruling : a judge yesterday rejected ' absurd ' claims by millionaire mr @entity10 that police officer conspired to discredit him - but mr @entity0 said today it was a ' nonsense incident ' and he felt sorry for the mp battle : the policeman and the mp clashed at the gates of @entity8 and the 15 - second exchange has sparked criminal and civil cases and left mr @entity10 with a Â£ 3million bill mr @entity0 , who heard part of the exchange and gave evidence in the @entity38 case , told @entity92 's today programme the @entity1 should have drawn a line under the incident , which had been leaked to the press			1
' i said in my evidence in chief last week that it was a nonsense incident that should n't have cost mr @entity10 his job , certainly should n't have cost the officers who were whistleblowers or - whatever your opinion of them is , whether they were leakers or whistleblowers - it should n't have cost them their jobs			1
' but here we are , with that			0
mr @entity10 lost his sense of humour			2
who has n't lost their sense of humour at work ? ' asked if he felt sorry for mr @entity10 , mr @entity0 said ' i very much do ' , but also expressed sympathy for the police officers who lost their jobs as a result of the investigations into how details of the incident were leaked			1
' it was all totally unnecessary , ' he said			2
' i do feel sorry for mr @entity10 , yes			1
' mr @entity0 said he had written to his superior officer setting out what had happened in the hope that the @entity1 could have put the matter ' into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there '			2
but he said : ' they were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was , but i was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest to the organisation			0
the commissioner had decided that a line would be drawn under it there			0
' mr @entity0 said : ' it could have been said that it is a minor incident that has be leaked to the newspapers and let 's all move on			0
' but of course we did n't move on and we ended up all at the @entity38 last week and this week			0
' it 's a great shame and at what cost to so many people			0
' mr @entity0 said the @entity21 needs ' serious reform ' , adding : ' i think they need to more clearly represent their members			2
this was not a hook to hang their grievances on			0

@entity0 was in @entity8 and called row ' nonsense incident '
@entity169 also criticised @entity21 and @entity1 commissioner
sir @entity28 sent letter to him that was ' not worth the stamp '
' it was all totally unnecessary . i do feel sorry for mr @entity10 ' , he said
