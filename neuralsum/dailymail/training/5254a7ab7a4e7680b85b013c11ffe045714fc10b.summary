in a dramatic move , members of the @entity18 ’s @entity17 have secretly called an emergency meeting so they can hold a vote of no confidence in their chair , dr @entity23 , who spoke forcefully against the reform			1
they believe that , if dr @entity25 is forced out , the move could help @entity9 leaders get around the rules and bring back the legislation before a new synod is elected in three years ’ time			0
the debacle , which was condemned by @entity31 and @entity32 , has sparked bitter recriminations within the @entity9 and left incoming archbishop of @entity4 , @entity5 , facing a crisis			0
much of the anger has focused on the lay members because the legislation fell by only six votes in their section of the @entity18 , which is made up of three houses : bishops , clergy and laity			1
a significant number are said to be furious that @entity17 chair dr @entity25 spoke out against the legislation rather than remaining neutral			1
one insider said : ‘ @entity48 should be unifying rather than polarising figures , especially when there is overwhelming support for legislation			0
’ they added there was such a groundswell of frustration that a vote of no confidence could well be passed , which could have implications for the future of the legislation			2
@entity62 's prime minister @entity31 has condemned the incident dr @entity25 , 66 , a leading conservative evangelical who was also a key opponent of the appointment of the gay cleric @entity67 as @entity68 in 2003 , said last night he was ‘ disappointed ’ that fellow synod members had turned against him			0
a spokesman for the @entity9 said that , under synod rules , a meeting of the @entity17 had to be convened if more than a tenth of its 210 members demanded it and well over that number had done so			2
meanwhile , the @entity78 has passed a motion of no confidence over the failure of the legislation .			0
