high court : the @entity57 @entity24 will hear @entity5 's lawsuit on wednesday			1
she has lost her case two rounds in lower courts			1
the @entity24 pictured above on october 6 , 2014 @entity5 's case hinges on the @entity64 , a law that @entity66 passed in 1978 specifically to include discrimination against pregnant women as a violation of the 1964 @entity70			1
@entity66 acted after the @entity24 , then composed entirely of men , said workplace rules that excluded pregnant workers from disability benefits and insurance coverage did not amount to sex discrimination under the landmark civil rights law			1
the question in @entity5 's case is whether @entity2 violated the law through its policy of providing temporary light - duty work only to employees who had on - the - job injuries , were disabled under federal law or lost their federal driver certification			1
' if you were painting your house and fell off a ladder , or if you had a ski accident , that would n't qualify for restricted light duty			0

the @entity106 administration and 120 congressional democrats are supporting @entity5			0

an unusual array of liberal , conservative , labor and women 's interest groups also has lined up behind @entity5			0
the pregnancy discrimination law ' protects the unborn child as well as the working mother who faces economic and other difficulties in bearing and raising the child , ' lawyer @entity126 wrote on behalf of anti-abortion organizations			2
@entity2 employed @entity5 as a part - time driver whose main job was to deliver overnight letters by 8:30 a.m. @entity2 requires people in those jobs to be able to lift packages as heavy as 70 pounds			1

unable to work , @entity5 also lost her medical and pension benefits , although she was covered under husband 's health insurance			0
' the benefits were good and benefits were hard to find with part - time jobs , ' she said			0
@entity5 eventually returned to @entity2 , but left in 2009 , a year after she sued			2
she argued that because @entity2 made accommodations for nonpregnant employees with work restrictions , it should have done the same for her			2

the justices agreed in july to review the case			0
since then , there have been two notable developments			0
the @entity179 updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in @entity5 's situation			0
@entity2 itself has changed its policy so that pregnant employees will be eligible for light - duty work			2
' @entity2 believed it was appropriate to update its workplace policies so that we can attract and retain the best workforce we can , ' @entity38 said			2
the change does not affect @entity5 , now a contractor for the federal @entity193			0
looking back , @entity5 said the situation was so upsetting because she felt she was able to work and considered herself pretty tough			0
