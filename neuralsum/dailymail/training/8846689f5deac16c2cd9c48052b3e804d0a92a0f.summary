by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 20 october 2013 updated : 02:12 est , 21 october 2013 a @entity4 comedy duo 's surreal pop single and bizarre music video they hoped would be a flop has beaten all the odds and become a viral sensation			1
the @entity9 ? ) , a spoof pop song created by brothers @entity12 and @entity13 , has received over 141million hits on @entity15 and become the fastest viewed song since @entity18 's @entity17			1
like @entity17 the video features strange costumes , memorable dance moves and nonsensical lyrics which have helped it to become a top 100 hit in 18 countries			1
the pair have also appeared on the @entity57 show , and as a special guest at the @entity60 festival in @entity61			0
the video was created as a favour by @entity64 , the company which made @entity67 's @entity66 video , and was supposed to be a stunt for the brother 's show @entity69 ( tonight with @entity13 )			1
the idea was to deliberately ' abuse ' the company 's talent by announcing their intention to make a fantastic video , only to return with the foxes song which they thought it would be impossible for anyone to like			2
however the show had to be completely re-scripted after the track became an accidental overnight hit			2
last @entity85 the success of @entity84 saw millions of @entity48 dress up as @entity86 singer @entity18 , and this year it looks as if foxes will be the latest craze			1
after the song went viral @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 - three of the biggest costume stores in the @entity48 - reported a huge surge in sales of fox costumes			1
the companies say they are struggling to keep up with a 40 per cent rise in demand and have been forced to order more stock , despite @entity85 being over a week away			1
huge hit : @entity86 musician @entity18 has the most viewed video on @entity15 ever with 1.8billion hits , though @entity31 reached 100million views faster and could set a new record the humorous pair have not revealed how much they have made from the single , though @entity18 's video , which was viewed 1.8billion times , reportedly earned him £ 3.6million from @entity15 clicks alone			1
the brothers have said that the original idea was to make a song about the problem of dancing in clubs and how there is no standard dance anymore - like the foxtrot or waltz - so three billion men head out every weekend without knowing what to do when they get into a club			0
however the plan was changed at the last minute to feature some sort of animal sound , and while lots of different creatures were considered , the fox eventually won out			0
@entity131 have now signed the brothers and are helping to promote the single , though they insist their first love will remain comedy and they have no desire to become pop stars			0
@entity13 told @entity137 : ' we ’re @entity139 we like to sing			2
' ' we 'll never pursue pure music as a career , ' added @entity12			0
' this is very new for us and everyone is asking , " what are you going to do now ? " we do n’t know			0
we ’re busy trying to figure out what to do the next day			0
' the comedians have produced music videos for their show before , but nothing has had quite the impact of their latest venture			0

@entity12 and @entity13 host a comedy show in @entity4
they created the song with @entity64 , who worked with @entity67
video has so far been viewed 141million times online
@entity164 debuted on @entity48 charts at number 29 and hit number one in @entity4
