@entity0 of @entity2 's baby is due as early as today , it has been revealed			2
according to one well - placed source , @entity5 's real due date is today or tomorrow - which would tie in with comments made by the @entity0 herself			1
speaking during an engagement in @entity10 last month , she said that her second child is due ' mid to late april '			1
' although april 25 is widely thought to be the @entity0 ' due date , royal sources point out that it has never been officially confirmed as such			1
' we have n't ever confirmed a due date , ' a @entity22 source told @entity25			2
' @entity0 herself said mid to late april and there have been plenty of dates bandied around in the media but we 've never confirmed anything and we never will			1
' however , the 25th remains a favourite with punters according to bookmakers @entity35 , although tomorrow and friday are also popular and are priced at just 6/1			0
@entity0 is currently thought to be staying at @entity22 , a short drive from the @entity37 at @entity38 where she is due to give birth			0
popular : the 25th is the favourite but the @entity42 says neither that date or any other has been confirmed preparations : the police were seen making final checks ahead of the birth outside the @entity48 yesterday yesterday , police could be seen searching the area in preparation for the @entity53 ' arrival and were seen peering under traffic cones and taking lamp posts apart			0
according to a statement released by @entity22 the same day , the new baby 's father , prince @entity17 , has finished his air ambulance training early and will now avoid the two - hour dash from @entity61 that some had predicted			2
' @entity64 has completed the first phase of his in - work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with @entity67 earlier than anticipated , ' the statement read			0
' this is due to a combination of @entity70 performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned			0
' as he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave , he will not return to duties with @entity79 until that time , and will remain on unpaid leave until then			0
' fans : royal fans have also set up camp outside the hospital , among them @entity85 , 71 ready to go : the scenes outside the hospital are reminiscent of those seen for @entity89 in 2013 back in town : the @entity42 has said prince @entity91 will be in @entity10 this weekend before returning to @entity92 but concerns have been raised about the possibility of the royal birth clashing with official events to mark the centenary of the @entity99 campaign , with prince @entity17 due to attend a wreath - laying service at the @entity101 on saturday			1
the ceremony , which is also being held to mark @entity103 , will be mirrored by another taking place in @entity105 which is due to be attended by the @entity17 and prince @entity91			1
@entity22 have also said that rather than return directly to @entity92 , where he is currently taking part in training exercises with the @entity109 , @entity91 will briefly travel back to @entity10 instead			0
@entity91 will attend sunday 's @entity110 , which , according to @entity22 sources , is a long - standing commitment but one that could be confirmed only after his @entity92 army schedule had been firmed up .			2
