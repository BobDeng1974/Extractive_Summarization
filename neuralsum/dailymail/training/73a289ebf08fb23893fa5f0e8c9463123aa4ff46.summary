there was no mistaking where prince @entity2 gets his dance moves from as he last night launched into an embarrassing routine in front of a giggling duchess of @entity7			1
@entity2 entertained @entity8 and numerous onlookers by throwing a few shapes on a visit to @entity14 ’s @entity13 homeless centre in @entity15 , south - east @entity16			1
he was chatting with resident @entity17 , 18 , when he asked her whether the uniform he wore to his wedding looked ' dapper '			0
@entity2 , 29 , looked pleased as punch and started doing a hip - hop style dance , brushing the shoulders of his jumper twice on each side			1
while it is likely his brother , @entity25 , would have cringed at his attempts , @entity8 and @entity17 both looked delighted			2
the prince was so chuffed at the reaction that he called @entity17 over to do it again at a reception later			2
he also let slip his and @entity8 's future plans when he discovered that his new friend was training to become a nursery nurse			0
' he said he was going to make his children come and i could discipline them , ' she revealed			0
' he is fantastic , he is great , i love him ... we are friends			0
' @entity2 's enthusiastic dancing was reminiscent of his father prince @entity54 's regular attempts to blend in with local traditions via some questionable moves			1
in the groove : prince @entity54 dances the samba with 20 - year - old @entity59 as he visits the @entity61 's village in @entity64 's @entity63 rainforest in 2009 most famously , during his first visit to @entity64 in 1978 , @entity54 took to the dance floor with a @entity68 dancer during a party staged by the mayor of @entity71			1
and as recently as 2009 , @entity54 was twirling with a scantily - clad village girl in the centre of the @entity63 rainforest			1
@entity2 was already familiar with the @entity15 centre he toured with his wife yesterday , having made a private visit in 2003 when he was 21			1
the couple were suitably dressed down for the occasion - @entity8 sported a @entity81 olive green jersey dress , clinched at her tiny waist with a thick black belt , and knee - length black suede boots			0
the prince also abandoned his habitual suit for blue cords and a jumper and shirt			0
during their engagement the couple viewed a group session on @entity14 ’s ‘ @entity98 ’ programme , which enables participants to prepare themselves in order to find a job			2
@entity2 and @entity8 also took part in a cookery class making low fat festive mince pies and gingerbread			2
in organising the event shortly before they headed off for the traditional royal @entity107 at @entity108 , the royal couple were following in the footsteps of princess @entity110			0
affectionate : @entity2 offered his bride - of - eight - months a guiding hand during the visit as a young boy @entity2 and @entity25 were regularly taken by their late mother on private visits to @entity14 hostels across the capital to better understand the lives of those less fortunate than themselves			1
@entity2 is now patron of the organisation which works with young homeless people and two years ago spent the night sleeping rough publicise the plight of the homeless at @entity107			2
@entity14 is a national charity providing housing and support to improve the lives of homeless young people aged 16 - 25			1
at any one time , it works with over 500 young people providing a range of services to help them tackle the issues that can lead to homelessness			0
in addition to a wide range of accommodation services , @entity14 also ensures young people have access to personal and mental health assistance and learning programmes , which enable them to develop the skills they need for a sustainable future			2
its housing services range from night shelters for emergencies to hostels for short stays and supported flats with facilities for learning on site			0
@entity2 and @entity8 took part in a healthy living cookery class making low fat festive mince pies and gingerbread at ease : the couple looked comfortable in the kitchen and @entity8 even made a heart - shaped birthday cookie for a girl who was celebrating her 18th birthday the charity also provides services specifically for young people who are leaving the care of the local authority , for ex-offenders and for young single parents			1
chief executive @entity173 said of the royal visit : ' it is a powerful motivator and prince @entity2 is a keen and passionate patron			1
' i have seen him talk to a young person and remember their story six months later			0
' this has been a difficult 12 months for the charity and our young people in particular			0
' there are one million young people unemployed in this country and ours are at the back of the queue as they have no qualifications , no experience and have chaotic lives			0
