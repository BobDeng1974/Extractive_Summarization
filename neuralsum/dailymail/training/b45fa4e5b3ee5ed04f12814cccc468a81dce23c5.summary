by @entity0 and @entity1 surprise admission : @entity3 said the first @entity5 report will be released next week military radar in @entity8 did track an unidentified aircraft as it flew across the country 's airspace after @entity5 lost contact with ground control , it was revealed today			1
@entity8 's prime minister @entity3 said the military 's radar tracked what is believed to have been the @entity18 plane after it had turned back while on a flight from @entity21 to @entity22 on march 8			1
' the military radar , the primary radar , has some capability , ' mr @entity3 said			1
' it tracked an aircraft which did a turn back but they were not sure , exactly sure , whether it was @entity5			1
' what they were sure of was that the aircraft was not deemed to be hostile			0
' mr @entity3 told @entity34 he did not believe it when he first heard about the critical satellite data on which the current search in the @entity37 is based on			1
' to be honest , i found it hard to believe , ' said the prime minister			2
' it 's a bizarre scenario which none of us could have contemplated so that 's why when i met the team ... of foremost experts in aviation industry i asked them again and again " are you sure ? " ' ' and their answer to me was we are as sure as we can possibly be			0
' earlier reports had suggested military radar had not picked up any definite radar information , leading to speculation that the @entity55 had been flown deliberately low and close to the coastline to avoid radar			0
@entity34 said that when mr @entity3 was asked if he believed the plane was now lost , he replied : ' on the balance of the evidence it would be hard to imagine otherwise			1
' the prime minister also revealed that the government 's preliminary report into the disappearance of the aircraft , which had 239 passengers and crew , would be released next week			1
did not crash : dr @entity69 says missing @entity70 ( file photo ) could not have crashed because modern communications systems meant that it could not simply disappear off the radar anger : a @entity76 relative of a passenger on missing flight at a meeting at @entity80 in @entity22 @entity8 's preliminary report into the disappearance of flight mh370 will be released next week , the country 's prime minister has said			1
@entity3 made the surprise announcement as his government continued to be beseiged by angry families , some of whom refuse to accept the plane was destroyed unless they have hard evidence			2
the report has already been sent to the @entity95 ' @entity94 but not made public			2
mr @entity3 told @entity34 : ' i have directed an internal investigation team of experts to look at the report , and there is a likelihood that next week we could release the report			1
' he later confirmed it will be released next week , @entity34 reported			0
despite seven weeks passing since the @entity18 jet vanished , mr @entity3 declined to say outright that it had been lost for good - ' out of respect ' for grieving families			1
@entity76 relatives of passengers on the missing @entity70 rest during a meeting reflective : a man stands in front of a billboard as @entity76 relatives of passengers on the missing @entity70 have a meeting at the @entity80 in @entity22 he told @entity34 's @entity118 : ' at some point in time i would be , but right now i think i need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin , and you know some of them have said publicly that they are n't willing to accept it until they find hard evidence			1
' the denial came despite @entity8 authorities a month ago telling families definitively - and by text message - that ' none of those on board survived '			2
the government has been repeatedly attacked by relatives of passengers , the majority of whom were from @entity76 , for not doing enough in its search for the jet			0
mr @entity3 's announcement came as a tropical cyclone again threatened to hamper a 26 - nation air , surface and underwater search of the @entity37			2
airborne searches were partly suspended for the last two days because of heavy rain , strong winds , rough seas thanks to @entity154			0
the hunt is already the most expensive in aviation history and is focusing on an area where acoustic ' pings ' were detected , possibly from the jet 's black box recorder , a month after it disappeared			2
key to the mission is the @entity163 undersea drone @entity164 - 21 , which will soon finish scouring a 6.2 square mile stretch of seabed			0
authorities have said if @entity169 fails to find a trace of the plane in its initial target search area , 1,200 miles north west of @entity173 , it will be redeployed to new areas			0
@entity176 prime minister @entity175 said the airliner 's probable impact zone was 430 miles long and 50 miles wide			1
a new search strategy would be adopted if nothing is found in the current seabed search zone			0
location : the @entity183 had been scrutinising photos of the object , which washed ashore six miles east of @entity186 in @entity188 state search : the @entity176 @entity163 launches its @entity192 ( @entity191 ) @entity190 as part of the search last week			0
the hunt for missing flight @entity5 has become the most expensive in aviation history looking : captain flt lt @entity198 of the @entity200 @entity199 flying a p - 3 orion during a search trying to locate missing @entity5 over the @entity37 ‘ if at the end of that period we find nothing , we are not going to abandon the search , we may well rethink the search , but we will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery , ’ he said			0
yesterday authorities ruled out any link between debris picked up on an @entity176 beach and the missing jet			1
the debris , found on wednesday on a beach at the southern tip of @entity188 state , was seen as the first lead since april 4 when the pings were detected			0
but it took @entity176 authorities less than a day to analyse detailed photographs of the beached debris , which included sheet metal with rivets , and dismiss the possibility that it may be linked to the plane			0
' we 're not seeing anything in this that would lead us to believe that it is from a @entity55 aircraft , ' said @entity183 commissioner @entity233 .			0

@entity8 's prime minister @entity3 said the military 's radar tracked what is believed to have been the @entity18 plane
it was detected after it had turned back while on a flight from @entity21 to @entity22 on march 8
@entity3 said preliminary findings would soon be made public
but he declined to say *explicitly* if the doomed jet was lost for good
' i need to take into account the feelings of the next of kin ' , he told @entity34
yesterday it *emerged* material on @entity176 beach was not from @entity5
@entity18 flight vanished on march 8 with 239 *people* on board
