by @entity0 this photographer is walking on thin ice after taking stunning photographs inside an @entity5 ice cave that could collapse at any moment			2
with its dazzling turquoise walls and huge open spaces , it 's hard to imagine that this incredible frozen cavern was only formed at the beginning of 2012			1
but despite its seemingly mystical allure , the fascinating natural phenomena is at risk of collapsing in on itself without warning			0
a friend of @entity19 holding up a red road flare inside the amazing @entity5 ice cave which is in danger of collapsing at any moment this photographer is walking on thin ice after taking stunning photographs inside an @entity5 ice cave that could collapse at any moment photographed by ice caver , @entity19 , 55 , the adventurer has known many caves collapse and disappear in his eight years exploring the local area			1
after trekking across a two mile long frozen lake , @entity19 and a few friends descended into the underground chamber and used a red road flare to highlight the ethereal blue of their surroundings			1
amazingly , the cavern is over 400 feet deep and at the back of the cave resides a moulon , a hole that leads straight up to the surface and is created by melting water pouring down to floor of the glacier			0
the intense colours are created by pure ice that is free of air , as the ice absorbs all colours of the light spectrum except for blue , the cave is lit up in a spectacular fashion			2
daring : a friend of @entity19 holding up a red road flare inside the amazing @entity5 ice cave which could collapse at any moment with its dazzling turquoise walls and and huge open spaces , its hard to imagine that this incredible frozen cavern was only formed at the beginning of 2012 @entity67 friend @entity66 holds a red flare ( left ) and looks up into the moulon ( right ) , a hole that leads straight up to the surface and is created by melting water despite its seemingly mystical allure , the fascinating natural phenomena is at risk of collapsing in on itself without warning mr @entity19 said : ' i always find it fascinating being inside any of these caves , but i do get a little apprehensive going in , they can and do collapse			1
' however , the beauty inside is just too powerful a temptation to not go inside			0
' the caves do melt back and disappear but this large cave has been holding on since the start of 2012			0
' i have found and explored about 15 caves now , some are small and some are very large , but this one was amazing because of its length			0
the entrance to the stunning @entity5 ice cave which was photographed by ice caver , @entity19 , 55 , who has been taking pictures of caves for eight years after trekking across a two mile long frozen lake , mr @entity19 and a few friends descended into the underground chamber the entrance to the stunning @entity5 ice cave : the cavern is over 400 feet deep and at the back of the cave resides a moulon , a hole that leads straight up to the surface ' i was with some friends from @entity109 at the time the photographs were taken , one of them have never even seen snow before let alone walk under a glacier , it was quite the experience for him			1
' at the end of the cave is a moulon , this is a hole created in the glacier that goes straight up and out and is created when melt water from the surface of the glacier starts to open a channel that pours down to underneath the glacier			0
' the red in the images is created by a road flare , i thought the red to blue color contrast would be fun to photograph and make for some great pictures			2
