benefits claimants cheats are able to keep money they are not entitled to because government officials fail to turn up to legal hearings , it emerged today			1
the @entity5 sent lawyers to just 4 per cent of tribunals held last year to rule on decisions to cut benefits			1
it means that in many cases people are able to successfully argue in favour of keeping their money , because the government has failed to turn up to challenge it			0
thousands of people who appeal against cuts to their benefit stand a better chance of success if the @entity5 do n't turn up without a @entity5 official , judges refer written submissions and lawyers suggest it means the case is more likely to be won by someone appealing to keep their benefits official figures also show that the @entity5 is more likely to win cases if it manages to send someone to the tribunal			1
there were some 250,000 benefits tribunals last year , as many more people tried to challenged to the welfare system forced through by @entity38			0
the @entity40 ’s decision to force millions of people to face new medical checks and work assessments has led to many people losing benefits , triggering a surge in legal challenges			0
@entity49 's @entity48 criticised the government for the soaring number of tribunals shadow justice secretary @entity48 said : ' government expenditure is under enormous pressure and instead of saving money , the @entity56 is actually spending more taxpayers ’ money on spiralling numbers of tribunal cases			2
' it 's a double whammy			0
over the last three years , there ’s been a shocking 35 per cent rise in the number of tribunals dealing with decisions made by government departments			2
' from april to december 2013 last year , only 4.3 per cent of cases had an official from @entity5 , the @entity68 reported			1
in 2010 the figure was 8 per cent and in 200 was 40 per cent			0
however , the government ’s own figures show that claimants are more likely to win their case if an official is not there			1
when an officer was present , just 41 per cent of benefits claimants won their case			1
but the figure rose to 50 per cent when there was no presenting officer from @entity5			1
solicitor @entity87 said : ‘ if i was an appellant i ’d rather have no representation any day than have somebody turn up , ' he said			0
' you ca n’t properly test or cross examine the evidence			0
there ’s no - one to answer them back			0
’ @entity49 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary @entity91 said : ‘ it 's yet another sign of the chaos and incompetence that now reigns at the @entity5 , and the utter failure of this government to get a real grip on benefits spending			2
’ justice minister @entity101 said : ‘ it is a matter for the relevant @entity5 or local authority as to whether they send a presenting officer to an appeal unless directed to do so by the @entity107			1
‘ departments and local authorities will consider each appeal on a case by case basis			0
the @entity5 played down the idea that it loses more appeals because it fails to send officers to court , but admitted it had down ‘ no studies ’ into the issue .			2

@entity5 *accused* of *bungling* legal cases
from april to december , officers *attended* just 4.3 per cent of tribunals
half of claimants win their case if the @entity5 fail to send an officer
lawyers say it is in the appellant 's *interests* if the @entity5 is a no - show
