@entity0 revealed the prospect of captaining @entity2 to victory again got him through some ' tough times '			1
the midfielder fought back after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago but after a lengthy lay - off struggled to keep his place in the national team and at @entity10			1
however , the 31 - year - old is enjoying a new lease of life at @entity14 after joining the @entity14 in the winter transfer window and @entity16 asked him to lead out the @entity17 in wednesday night 's 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity19 at @entity20 , as recent skipper @entity21 was rested			1
@entity0 brings the ball under control during @entity2 's 1 - 0 win over @entity19 ' it was great to be back , ' said @entity0			1
' you are representing your country , you are captain , you win a game at home against @entity19 , it is things you thought about doing when you were going through tough times			1
' it was a while since i played at @entity20 , i was thinking that driving in			1
but i really enjoyed it and the pitch was really good as well			2
' @entity21 was n't starting so it was my turn to step up and be captain			1
i have said before , i am what i am now on and captain or not , i am going to be exactly the same			0
' we have a lot of leaders in that dressing room which is important			0
' there is competition for places which is great			0
it means i have to step up my performance when i play			0
' it is great for the manager and great for the squad that we are all pushing each other and performing well			0
@entity0 wins a challenge against former @entity10 team - mate @entity57 ' i feel great			1
i feel stronger with every 90 minutes and i am seeing improvement all the time so hopefully there is more to come as well			0
' the match served as a warm - up for @entity2 's @entity63 qualifier against @entity64 minnows @entity65 at the national stadium on sunday and it took a late @entity69 header to separate the teams			1
the @entity17 are all but certain to move on to 10 points after five fixtures against @entity74 's newest member but @entity0 is too long in the tooth to go overboard about qualification hopes			2
since making his debut under @entity79 in a friendly against @entity81 in 2003 , @entity2 have failed six times to qualify for a major finals			2
he said : ' we have great confidence in ourselves and in the group but i have been in this position before with @entity2 and we have not managed to see it over the line			2
' everything we have done up until now has been great but the hard work is still to come			0
@entity0 was thrilled to be back captaining his country after a long absence ' you have to keep reiterating that			2
we have an important match on sunday			0
' win that and that takes us into the qualifier in june ( away to @entity101 ) which is going to be an important game but there is still a lot of work to do			0
' ' we have put ourselves in a great position but the hard work begins now and let 's see it out			0
' @entity0 believes patience on and off the pitch will be key against a @entity65 side who , after failing to score a goal , far less win a point , in four games , will have damage limitation on their minds			1
he said : ' hopefully the fans are patient with us when we are trying to play our football and break teams down			0
' they were against @entity19 and it is important that they help us as much as they can .			2
