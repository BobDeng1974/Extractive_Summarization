by @entity0 published : 08:58 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 15:19 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 has blasted a @entity5 media recording of a private conversation in which he appeared to criticise his strikers a ' disgrace ' as he defended his relationship with @entity10			1
@entity3 , whose comments were broadcast on @entity5 tv , said he was joking when he complained about @entity14 's lack of strikers and made an unflattering comment about the age of @entity10			1

it is a disgrace that someone is taping it when we do n’t know			0
' i think you should be embarrassed , as a media professional because from my point of view i do n't think you - not you [ here in this room ] , but a colleague - ( should be ) able to record a private conversation and to make it public			2
' @entity3 also said @entity10 has no reason to be upset about the leaked comments			1
he joked that @entity10 was probably older than 32 and hinted that an ideal solution may be to sign @entity53 because the @entity54 deserved a bigger audience than he had at @entity56			2
' i need a striker , @entity53 needs a club , ' @entity3 is secretly recorded as saying			2
' a player like him can not play in front of 3,000 people			0
@entity56 is a club to end ( your career with )			0
' @entity3 was caught in conversation with the boss of @entity68 watch - makers @entity66 , explaining that @entity14 did not have anyone to score goals			1
the conversation was recorded by @entity5 broadcasters @entity72 in @entity68 on february 17 and appeared as a video clip on their website			0
it has since been removed but @entity3 ’s words had already been well circulated , much to the @entity14 manager 's embarrassment			1

he said : ' @entity10 is @entity10 , he is four times a @entity28 winner , people think three but it is four			1
once with @entity112 , twice with @entity113 and once with @entity103			0
' it is with him i had the best season of my career			0
he is one of few players to work with me at a second club			2
he has no reason to be upset			0
' also he told a few years ago that , " @entity3 is the only manager in the world i would never play for "			1
after a few years he was playing with me at @entity103 and now he is playing for me			0
' there is no story			0
' threat : @entity84 will pose problems for former club @entity14 when he lines up for @entity29 friends reunited : @entity3 says it will be strange going up against @entity84 - but he has to forget about it on his reunion with former @entity14 striker @entity84 , @entity3 says he will try to put his feelings for the striker to one side during the game			1
he added : ' i look forward to every match			0
i ’m happy to do it			0
i like to do it against the best and @entity29 is the @entity139 champions			2
' @entity84 , i know is difficult and it ’s a strange feeling			1
i have to admit that			0
we have to do our job			0
i know he wants to do his job			0
it ’s a strange feeling we have to try to forget during the game			2
watching over things : a large poster of @entity150 , the late founder of modern @entity139 , hangs on the side of a building as @entity14 players take part in a training session ready to go : @entity14 's @entity156 ( far right ) and @entity94 ( next right ) during training @entity160 stars : @entity94 and his @entity14 teammates prepare for the test in @entity163 watching on : @entity3 looks in good spirits during training ' even during the game sometimes you look at players who belong to my life like @entity84 and ( @entity172 ) @entity171 , and i have to play against them and it ’s not the same			1
' i played @entity14 once and the feeling not the same but you have to do your job			2
that ’s the basic principle of football			0
you have to forget or at least try to forget			0
