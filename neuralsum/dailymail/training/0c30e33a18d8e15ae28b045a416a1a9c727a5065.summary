lawsuit : art enthusiast @entity1 has been accused of amassing huge debts with auction houses a sheikh who has spent more than £ 1billion on his art collection has denied accusations of being a ' serial defaulter ' and amassing a pile of unpaid debts with some of the world ’s top auction houses			1
@entity1 - ' reputedly the world ’s largest collector of objets d’art ' - is being sued by dealers who say he has dishonoured a pledge to pay $ 19.7 million for a collection of ancient @entity19 coins sold at auction in @entity21 in january			1
@entity1 , 45 , ' purchased nearly $ 20 million worth of coins from the @entity24 ' , regarded as the finest assortment of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity29 @entity19 coins ever assembled , the @entity22 was told			1
although the dealers are still holding the coins they are insisting that the sheikh should be bound by his bid at auction			1
the dealers ’ @entity34 , @entity35 , likened @entity1 to an ' inveterate gambler ' who could not stop himself spending millions on objects of his desire before walking away from his obligations			1
' he bids , wins and then does n’t pay			1
one can only conclude that this is a person acting dishonourably and disreputably			0
he is bidding when he knows he ’s not going to be able to pay , ' the barrister claimed			1
' perhaps in a perverse way he enjoys the process of bidding			2
if one wants to be an amateur psychiatrist , maybe he is like an inveterate gambler who ca n’t stop himself gambling at @entity49 every day			2
' three dealers - @entity51 and @entity52 , @entity53 , who trades as @entity54 , and @entity55 - say the sheikh has given no ' explanation or excuse ' for his failure to pay , and mr @entity35 said he had left an ' extraordinary trail of unpaid debts '			1
the case reached the @entity22 as their lawyers urged mr @entity64 to continue an asset freezing injunction imposed on the sheikh , who is a cousin of the ruling emir of @entity69 , on october 9			1
mr @entity35 made hotly disputed allegations that @entity1 ’s total unpaid bill to worldwide auctioneers and art dealers includes £ 4.3 million owed to @entity74 , around $ 42 million owed to @entity75 , and various other sums owed to at least five other auction houses and art dealers			1
' the fact that he is a member of the @entity69 royal family is not relevant , ' the @entity34 went on - ' because if this is his conduct it does n’t matter who he is			2
' case : the row relates to the sale of the @entity24 collection of @entity19 coins ( file picture ) he repeatedly gave @entity51 the ' run - around ' when they tried to pin him down about paying the $ 19.7 million bill , mr @entity35 alleged , offering to pay part of the outstanding cash in return for acquiring some of the coins			1
' there were further meetings asking for the money , but basically nothing was paid , ' he added			0
treasures : the @entity101 ( pictured ) - a @entity103 treasure - was brought back from @entity104 by @entity105 in the 18th century and bought by the sheikh for £ 3million the deadlock over payment became so entrenched that the @entity110 ambassador to @entity69 - and his opposite number in @entity112 - became involved			2
' but , despite the best efforts of the two ambassadors , no payment has been forthcoming from the sheikh , ' said the @entity34			0
the sheikh rose to prominence after he spent £ 1billion on art between 1996 and 2004			0
in 2000 , he splashed out more than £ 9m on 136 vintage photographs including great works by @entity122 and @entity123 from the collection of @entity126 photographer @entity125			0
other prominent purchases during this time include a £ 5m fabergé egg bought at @entity130 in @entity21 in 2002 , a £ 4.6m complete set of @entity133 's @entity132 , and a £ 7.9m @entity135 marble statue , the @entity136			0
in 2003 he beat @entity112 's @entity137 to purchase the £ 3m @entity139 flask			0
' @entity1 was a passionate art collector with a great eye , ' said @entity142 , editor - at - large of @entity144			2
in 2005 the @entity1 's spree came to a dramatic end when he was placed under house arrest in @entity69			2
he allegedly used a @entity112 dealer to fake invoices , misleading the @entity69 government about the value of the items he was buying			0
he was sacked from the country 's national culture council			0
however , within a year he was spotted at auctions again			0
in 2008 , he bought 90 per cent of the lots at a sale of @entity159 art at @entity130			0
last month , he was spotted at the @entity160 in @entity161			0
mr @entity35 also voiced concerns that the sheikh might be decamping from his @entity112 base now that his creditors have begun to gather , claiming that he left the @entity110 earlier this month ' when the going began to get hot '			0
prized : a full set of ' @entity132 ' ( 1827 - 1838 ) by @entity133 ( sample of three drawings ) was sold to @entity1 for £ 4.6m beautiful : the sheikh added the @entity136 , a @entity135 statue circa late 1st to mid 2nd century @entity172 for £ 7.9m but the sheikh ’s @entity34 , @entity174 , brushed aside the suggestion that he might be fleeing the jurisdiction			1
he is currently in @entity178 - @entity69 ’s capital - ' where he is a member of the royal family , ' said the barrister			2
' he has n’t slunk off in the night to @entity178 , ' added mr @entity174 , noting that it was ' not unusual ' for men in the sheikh ’s position to ' go back to the @entity185 when the temperatures begin to drop ' in the @entity110			2
however , mr @entity35 claimed the sheikh had left ' almost a trail of destruction ' behind him			0
' he is a serial defaulter , as we have seen , in terms of auctions , ' the @entity34 added			0
denying those accusations on the sheikh ’s behalf , mr @entity174 said he had been ' trying to pay ” for the coins for the past nine months			1
' there are no doubt timing issues which go to why he can not pay at the moment , but that ’s not a reason to make a freezing order against someone , ' urged the barrister , who said the sheikh had been a faithful customer to leading art dealers over the years			1
' he is a very well - known and internationally regarded art collector , ' said mr @entity174 , who denied that the sheikh had accumulated a tide of unpaid debts			0
mr @entity174 also attacked the case against the sheikh as ' obviously wrong ' , pointing out that the dealers had no basis for enforcing a contract of sale with him , as they had merely ' organised ' the sale of coins owned by an ' unidentified ' client of @entity51 and sons			1
the @entity22 heard that the @entity1 had given people the ' run around ' and has tens of millions of debts with famous auction houses the @entity34 added : ' the way in which the @entity228 complaint is formulated is misconceived , in that it purports to be a claim for enforcement of a ‘ contract of sale ’ , notwithstanding that the claimants were not on any view parties to any such contract with the sheikh			1
' there was no evidence before the court on the value of the coins which the sheikh ' allegedly agreed to buy ' , added the barrister , who said that the dealers still have the coins and are free to find a buyer for them if they wish			2
mr @entity64 has now reserved his judgment in the case .			0
