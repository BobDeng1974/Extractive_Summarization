by @entity1 reporter grumpy and miserable people in the workplace are more productive , according to a new study he or she may not be the most popular person in the workplace , but your grumpy colleague may just be the person to turn to when a task needs completing			1
researchers say workers described as ‘ haters ’ are more focused because they spend a lot of time on fewer activities			1
it means they are good at their job because they hone their skills in specific tasks			1
however , those seen as the life and soul of the workplace – ‘ likers ’ – spread themselves more thinly , possibly making them less productive employees			1
the findings , from researchers at the @entity33 and @entity34 and published in the journal @entity36 , may have implications for understanding the development of expertise			1
participants in the study reported their activities over a week and also completed a measure of ‘ dispositional attitudes ’ – how they reacted to various situations			2
although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued , the former tended to do fewer			2
@entity51 may have difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting opportunities in their environment			0
to prove their point , in two studies participants reported all their activities over a week and also completed a measure of dispositional attitudes			0
although haters and likers did not differ in the types of activities they pursued , the former tended to do fewer throughout the period			2
almost 15 percent of the differences in how many activities people conducted was associated with their personality			0
however , those seen as the life and soul of the workplace spread themselves more thinly , says the study haters and likers also did not differ in how much time they spent on them , just the number they managed			1
as a result , haters spent more time on any given activity			0
so , compared with likers , haters would be characterised as less active because they do fewer things , or as more focused because they spend more time on the small number of things they do			1
dr @entity88 said : “ the present results demonstrate that patterns of general action may occur for reasons other than the desire to be active versus inactive			0
' indeed , some people may be more active than others not because they want to be active per se , but because they identify a large number of specific behaviours in which they want to engage			0
' they added likers may have more difficulty sustaining attention on a task because they perceive so many interesting and distracting opportunities in their environment			0
in contrast , because haters like so few things , they may be unlikely to be distracted when they are doing a task , and thus their generalized dislike may actually benefit their attention			0

grumpy workers are more productive as they spend more time on fewer tasks
happy employees spread themselves more thinly , according to research
study carried out by the @entity33 and @entity34
