bladder cancer victim @entity0 pictured at home in @entity2 , @entity3 with her son @entity4 a cancer patient who was told she had a good chance of making a full recovery has now been diagnosed as terminally ill - after waiting ten weeks for surgery because of a beds shortage at her local @entity11 hospital			1
when @entity0 was diagnosed with bladder cancer last year , doctors were optimistic because the disease had not spread			1
she underwent a programme of chemotherapy which ended in early december and according to @entity11 rules , should have been operated on within a month			1
but the surgery was repeatedly delayed because of the lack of an available bed at @entity21 near @entity22			1
in late february this year , the mother - of - two was finally sent for treatment at a private hospital but by then the cancer had spread to her pelvic wall making it inoperable			1
she was later told the cancer was probably terminal			2
her family are now launching legal action against @entity21 , which was put in ' special measures ' in april			0
last night , mrs @entity0 , 62 , from @entity2 in @entity32 , said : ' i truly believe that if they had done the operation when they should have , in early january , i would not be in this situation			1
it 's now inoperable , and they 've said there 's nothing more they can really do			0
' she recalled how , after being turned away for her operation the first time , her surgeon had told her to stage a sit - down protest if it happened again			2
when she went in a few days later and was told once more that there were no beds , she decided to try the tactic			0
but after walking around intensive care , the surgeon told her there was no point			0
that second delay , on february 9 , prompted a referral to a @entity58 private hospital			0
but it was not until february 21 that she went under the knife			0
mrs @entity0 's son @entity4 , 37 , a marketing executive , quit his job in @entity65 to become his mother 's carer			1
he said the family had become more and more uneasy as the weeks passed			0
he said : ' we were asking , " are these delays normal ? is n't there a risk the cancer will spread ? " ' the shocking case comes as official figures published yesterday showed cancer waiting time targets in @entity78 have been missed for the first time in five years			2
@entity0 's family are now launching legal action against @entity21 , pictured @entity82 , founder of the charity fight @entity84 , said treatment delays were happening ' more and more ' because of growing pressures on the @entity11			1
he said there was ' no justification ' for the wait mrs @entity0 endured , adding : ' for bladder cancer , it 's absolutely essential to have early treatment			1
any delay can be fatal			0
' @entity21 has had problems for years			0
the @entity95 's decision to put the @entity11 trust that runs it into ' special measures ' came after a string of revelations by @entity101 , including details of a leaked report which revealed dozens of patients could have died because of sub-standard surgery			2
a hospital spokesman said : ' we would like to apologise to mrs @entity0 for the delay in her treatment			2
the trust has launched an inquiry			0
