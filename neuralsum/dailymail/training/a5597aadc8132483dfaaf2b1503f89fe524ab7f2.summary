when @entity1 speaks he tends to make sense			1
so when , after @entity6 ’s trouncing of hapless @entity7 , the @entity4 claimed @entity8 could be tougher opponents than @entity11 visitors @entity10 , heads turned			1
did he really just say that ? he did — and @entity14 ’s leader had a point			0
‘ @entity10 ’s ability is not about hurting you all game , ’ @entity1 explained			1
‘ you can have tougher games when you go to @entity8			1
it ’s about the fact @entity10 can decide a game within a second			1
@entity10 's attacking trio of @entity26 ( left ) , @entity27 ( centre ) and @entity29 @entity30 and @entity31 can provide the magic for @entity6 , believes @entity1 @entity1 believes that @entity8 can be a tougher challenge than upcoming opponents @entity10 @entity35 ( right ) celebrates scoring the winner for @entity8 on saturday alongside @entity37 ‘ they have more players than anyone else in the world who can finish games with a touch of magic			1
’ @entity1 knows all about those game - finishing moments			1
last season he was at fault , stepping up for an offside that was never there when @entity27 was set clear at the @entity50 with the tie at 0 - 0			2
@entity1 ’s defensive partner , @entity52 , had little option but to bring down @entity27 in the area			2
from relative comfort , @entity6 found themselves a goal down and a man short , all because of a tiny lapse in concentration			2
they would go on to lose the tie 4 - 1 on aggregate			0
on the evidence of saturday evening ’s procession , however , @entity14 ’s men would appear to be better equipped a year on for the home leg			0
yes , they will miss the suspended @entity66 in the first game but , with an hour gone and his rampant side already 5 - 0 up against a @entity7 outfit collapsing quicker than @entity71 ’s cricketers against @entity72 , @entity14 declared and took off two - goal magician @entity31 and the revitalised @entity30			2
@entity30 calmly placed his spot - kick past @entity74 to converted in the second minute against @entity7 @entity31 finished low in the corner to put @entity6 4 - 0 up against @entity7 on saturday @entity31 went on to blast in the fifth and final goal with the pick of the strikes from outside the area @entity31 celebrates with @entity30 as they ran riot at the @entity50 on saturday evening both can provide for @entity6 those moments of brilliance @entity1 referred to			1
@entity30 , who missed the first leg last year and retired at half - time in the second , will be relishing the opportunity			2
as is @entity1 , who added that @entity6 are not scared of their now familiar foes			1
‘ fear ? ’ he said			0
‘ we do n’t fear them			0
you do n’t go in at this level fearing strikers			0
we want to play against them			0
it ’s the fourth time in a year now			0
there ’s nothing new to worry us , it ’s a case of having the whole team at a very high level			0
’ a cool penalty from @entity30 , a thumping close - range shot from @entity104 and a sublime finish from the reborn @entity106 put @entity6 3 - 0 up after just 21 minutes			1
a quickfire double from @entity31 following the break had @entity7 fans streaming for the bars			0
before five - star city narrowed the gap on @entity114 to five points , @entity10 had suffered a surprise 1 - 0 home defeat at the hands of @entity14 ’s former club @entity119			1
the @entity120 , who introduced £ 28million man @entity122 for a half - hour cameo , cancelled a planned briefing with the @entity126 press last week for fear it would distract from the visit of @entity129 ’s generous @entity7			1
but did @entity10 take their eye off the ball ? @entity52 brought down @entity27 at the @entity50 during last season 's @entity11 clash @entity52 was sent off before @entity10 went on to win the tie 4 - 1 over two legs and progress ‘ maybe they were thinking about tuesday , ’ said @entity14			1
when the @entity138 came calling last year , @entity6 remained in the @entity139 and the @entity140			2
this time there are no such diversions and @entity14 reluctantly admitted this put them in better shape			0
‘ we ’d played 18 games in december and january and were really tired by the time we met @entity10			1
this time we are arriving at the game not having so many games as last season and that could be @entity152 would always prefer to stay in the cup competitions but when you are out of them it is easier to focus			1
’ @entity14 agreed that @entity30 , out for five weeks following a knee injury in december , was nearing top form again			0
‘ every game he is improving and he is now arriving again to the high - performance level he had before his injury , ’ he said			2
@entity129 , left to rue a display that started badly and got worse , does not believe the defeat will harm his chances of landing the @entity7 job permanently			0
‘ it ’s not going to be the @entity167 , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ll be judged on the games against @entity170 and teams like that			0
’ for @entity6 , whose owners demand @entity177 progression , judgment is looming .			0

@entity1 says you can have harder time at @entity8 than @entity10
but @entity10 have the *quality* to ' decide a game within a second '
@entity6 face the @entity126 *giants* in @entity11 last - 16
they were beaten by @entity10 at the same stage last season
