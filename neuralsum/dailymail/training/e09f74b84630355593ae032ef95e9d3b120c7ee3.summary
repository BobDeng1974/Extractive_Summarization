by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner it is a sad indictment of the ruinous procession of owners who have occupied the boardroom at @entity5 over the last decade that @entity7 fans are welcoming convicted fraudster @entity8 as their new man in charge			1
there is a grim fatalism among the faithful , a sense that @entity16 ’s most dysfunctional club will always make news for the wrong reasons , a trend that began 40 years ago with @entity20 ’s disastrous 44 days in charge immortalised in the book @entity23			1
one more owner marking his arrival at @entity5 with a series of eyebrow - raising quotes and seemingly illogical decisions is grist to the mill. just like @entity20 telling @entity33 to dump all their medals in the dustbin , @entity25 ’s wind of change is nothing more than a mild breeze to the @entity7 fans			1
he shut the players ’ canteen , told them to bring their own sandwiches , demanded they live in the city , and has now informed them they must buy their own match - day socks			1
@entity8 hired @entity62 as coach , a man who was sacked by @entity64 after losing seven of eight games			1
but he has promised to buy back their stadium ‘ by november ’ and get @entity7 back into the @entity45 within two years			1
he offers hope to fans who have been let down by owners and managers since chairman @entity72 , whose legacy of reckless spending is still felt at the club			1
dubious : @entity8 appointed @entity62 as coach despite his poor track record in management better days : club legend @entity33 in action against @entity81 @entity82 champions : @entity84 and his @entity7 team - mates celebrate lifelong @entity7 fan @entity86 , who wrote the last champions , a book about @entity90 ’s 1992 title winners , claimed even the decision to recruit @entity62 is defensible			1
‘ we ’ve had big - name managers — @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 — none of them have ever done anything at @entity7 , so it might be worth having a go on a complete unknown quantity , ’ he said			1
there has been a marked turnaround in opinion about @entity25			2
when he first tried to take over in february , angry fans barricaded his car inside the @entity109 car park			2
then a prankster released online a phone conversation where he ranted about @entity7 striker @entity114 ’s wages and the ‘ f * * * * * * devil ’ @entity117 ( @entity7 then managing director )			2
‘ he tells it how it is in no uncertain terms and the fans relate to that because that ’s a very @entity127 trait , ’ said @entity119			2
@entity8 , 56 , said this week that at the time of his buy - out , @entity7 cost £ 125,000 a day to run , of which £ 70,000 was essentially losses			1
fraudster ? @entity8 openly admitted the reason he sold @entity132 is because he was @entity7 best player ‘ this club is going to have more quiet time and less problems now , ’ he said , ‘ and the people who used to rip the club off , they ’re going to stop			1
i ’ll protect the club from everyone , including myself			2
’ he claimed substantial cuts and a reduced wage bill were starting to reduce expenditure			0
but the immediate future of @entity7 may be more turbulent than he expects , with at least a couple of sacked employees seeking legal advice about securing fair payouts from the club			1
the effects of the new regime are already being felt among the staff			0
three of their most loyal academy coaches were axed two weeks ago			0
@entity156 , who played for @entity7 from 2009 to 2013 , returned from a family holiday to a letter from academy director @entity159 , telling him his services were no longer required			2
ditto @entity161 , head of coaching at the academy			0
@entity164 , a former club captain , had a meeting where the only representative of the club was a payroll officer			2
goalkeeping coach @entity168 was also axed			0
fans ' favourite : @entity164 battle with @entity172 during his time as @entity7 captain goodbye : @entity164 has a white rose tattooed on his upper arm , such is his affinity with the club @entity164 , such a diehard @entity7 fan he had a white rose tattoo inked on his upper arm when he moved to @entity183 , was the most surprising departure			1
he coached the under - 18s to a league title last season and secured professional contracts for 14 out of 18 of his players — the best ever success rate at the club			2
@entity156 even offered to continue working with the under - 16s for free			0
‘ i love the club and i wanted to grow as a coach there , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve had a season ticket since i was a boy and so have my dad and granddad so i wanted to give something back			0
@entity164 and i are both local lads			0
’ @entity156 said he ‘ holds no grudges against @entity7 ’ , and he is often called by first - team players for advice			1
‘ i hope @entity8 can be a success			0
he seems to be stripping things back to basics with the players			2
’ gone , too , is club captain and top scorer @entity132 , sold to @entity210 for £ 11million			0
‘ i did n’t want to sell @entity132 because for me , he was the best player we had , ’ said @entity8			0
‘ he scored 29 goals			0
’ allowed to leave : last season 's top scorer @entity132 has been sold to @entity210 for £ 11million replacement : @entity8 has brought in @entity48 @entity216 from @entity217 to fill void left by @entity132 new face : goalkeeper @entity220 has also moved to @entity5 from @entity48 @entity8 has looked to his native @entity48 for new blood , signing goalkeeper @entity220 , midfielder @entity216 and forward @entity222			1
he also promised ‘ five or six ’ further signings			0
across @entity127 , in a smart house in @entity225 , @entity226 , former @entity7 managing director , is not hopeful of the new regime			2
‘ where ’s the ambition there , ’ he said , ‘ to get rid of your best player ? ’ at 82 , @entity234 , closely associated with the @entity90 era that brought the last title to @entity7 , looks like the sort of chap who would slap you on the back and stuff a cigar in your mouth			1
he claims the club has been on a downhill spiral since @entity72 took over			0
‘ @entity25 is no different from the others , ’ he said , ‘ hiring a @entity248 manager to go into what should be a @entity45 club , where ’s the ambition there ? @entity7 has been raped of money and ambition for years now			1
when i was there we had 40,000 crowds every week and plans to expand to 60,000 seats			0
now they ’re happy if they get 20,000			0
‘ @entity7 should be top six in the @entity45			1
a city this size with supporters as passionate as they are and they ’ve been robbed by irresponsible owners who borrowed money on future gates			0
how dare they do that ! it ’s the fans who i feel sorry for			0

@entity48 has told players to bring their own sandwiches to training , buy their own matchday socks and demanded they live in @entity7
he hired @entity62 off the back of seven defeats in eight games for @entity64
@entity25 has promised to buy back @entity5 ' by november ' and said the club will be playing @entity45 football within two years
fans are *believing* in the @entity48 after the *nightmare* they have endured under owners like @entity282
