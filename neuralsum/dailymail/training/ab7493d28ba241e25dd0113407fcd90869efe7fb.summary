inquiry : care minister @entity1 said the number of cases was ' unacceptable ' ministers yesterday ordered an independent inquiry into why hospitals have been paid to hit targets for numbers of patients dying on the @entity10			1
the new investigation will examine how hospitals have received tens of millions of pounds to implement the controversial system for care of the dying			2
care and support minister @entity16 said there had been too many cases of patients dying on the pathway while their families were told nothing about the withdrawal of life - saving treatment			1
‘ this is simply unacceptable , ’ he added			2
mr @entity1 said the inquiry would ‘ consider the value of locally set incentives , and whether they are leading to bad decisions or practice ’			0
the decision to order an independent investigation follows deepening concern over the @entity10 , which is thought to be used in the deaths of 130,000 hospital patients each year			1
the method , first developed in a @entity10 hospital and widely in use across the @entity40 for the past four years , aims to ease the suffering of dying patients			1
it commonly involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs , and the removal of tubes providing nutrition and fluids			0
but in the past few weeks , a string of relatives have contacted the mail expressing concern about the @entity10 , saying patients have been put on it without their knowledge			1
many have recovered fully after being taken off the pathway			0
medical critics have said there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come , arguing that the pathway amounts to a self - fulfilling prophecy , that many patients die before they should , and that the system is used to free beds and get rid of difficult patients			2
ministers have made a series of concessions to critics over the past month , including the establishment of an inquiry led by the same palliative care doctors who have been instrumental in promoting the use of the @entity10			1
they have also changed @entity40 rules to put a legal obligation on hospitals to tell families when a relative is put on the pathway			0
one of too many : cancer patient @entity83 , 90 , pictured with his daughter @entity84 , was put the @entity10 at his home without any consultation with his family yesterday ’s decision to launch a full independent inquiry followed a summit between ministers , doctors in favour of the @entity10 , and their critics , at the @entity95 in @entity96			1
the internal medical inquiry into the @entity10 will now be taken over by the independent chairman , who is yet to be picked			1
critics of the @entity10 said the review should be overseen by a high court judge			1
the decision to call an independent investigation is understood to have been heavily influenced by the @entity105 mp for @entity106 , @entity104 , who was at the meeting			0
mrs @entity104 , a mother of two who is an evangelical @entity109 , said she had refused to allow her father to be placed on the @entity10 and he is still alive in a nursing home six months later			1
after the meeting , mr @entity1 said the independent inquiry would report back to him in the @entity114			0
on ‘ bribe ’ payments , first revealed by the @entity116 , which have seen at least £ 30million given to hospitals that hit targets for numbers of patients who die on the pathway , mr @entity1 said : ‘ we are doing an analysis to focus on the circumstances under which these payments have been made			0
‘ i do n’t want any payments to be made for anything other than to improve the experience of death			0
‘ payments must not be made unless it is absolutely clear that it ’s genuinely improving the end of life and is not just a payment for putting people on a list or a register			0
’ one of the leading medical figures at the summit was professor @entity140 , consultant neurologist at @entity141 , who rang alarm bells over the @entity10 in the summer in a speech arguing that it had become a euthanasia pathway			2
prof @entity140 said the independence of the inquiry would depend on who was in charge of it			0
‘ if it is a palliative care doctor , it means zero , but if it is a member of the judiciary it will be very good , ’ he added			0
among those at the summit who defended the @entity10 was @entity157 , professor of palliative medicine at the @entity159 and one of the leading figures behind its design .			2

several cases have been reported where patients have been put on @entity10 without their family *'s* knowledge
care minister @entity16 called the number of cases ' unacceptable '
@entity10 through to be a part in 130,000 deaths of hospital patients every year
