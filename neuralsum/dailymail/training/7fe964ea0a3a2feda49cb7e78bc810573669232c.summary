by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it feels almost churlish to be labelling someone who cost £ 27million as an unexpected hero ; for that kind of money the volume of goals @entity7 has scored this season should be mandatory			1
twenty - four in all competitions is n’t to be sniffed at , but for whatever reason it just has n’t happened for the @entity14 at @entity15 before now			1
he is a divisive character at the @entity17			2
some absolutely loathe a bumbling first touch and lack of link - up ; others recognise that the 28 - year - old is a goalscorer and a player who works harder with more intelligence than his languid style suggests			1
@entity15 have proved in recent weeks that if you ping balls into the box , @entity7 will be waiting to tuck in			1
marksman : @entity7 has scored crucial goals at @entity31 and @entity32 recently to help guide @entity15 towards the title and that ’s exactly what he ’s done in recent weeks			1
nodding in @entity38 ’s cross at @entity31 with the confidence of a poacher , he settled the nerves at @entity42 early on			2
he did the same at @entity43			2
@entity7 averages a goal every 136 minutes , the sixth best in @entity47 history : @entity48 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .115 @entity49 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 122 @entity50 ... ... ... ... ... ... .128 @entity51 ... ... ... ... ... 128 @entity52 ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
.135 @entity7 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 136 on saturday @entity7 was unplayable at @entity32			2
not only did he score twice - yes , he had two bites at the cherry for his first - but the striker was a real handful for @entity57 and @entity58			1
the debate still goes on about whether he ’s really up to it or not			2
immediately after the 1 - 1 draw against @entity63 in march , supporters threw a portion of blame at @entity7 , who was perceived to have been lazy and unproductive			1
on that particular day he looked lonely , an isolated targetman hoping for someone to play off			2
since , @entity68 has urged @entity69 and @entity70 to get closer to him away from home			0
the results at @entity31 and @entity32 are testament to that , while they perhaps should ’ve gone away from @entity74 with something			0
@entity76 start : @entity7 runs away after putting @entity15 1 - 0 at @entity31 - the same day as @entity77 lost to @entity78 tamed beast : @entity80 looked a sensation in the first half of the season but his form has tailed off the @entity85 is finding a way to get the best out of @entity7 in a way in which @entity89 could n’t			1
he ’s had to , given @entity48 ’s injury trouble - to have left him out for months on end - and @entity80 ’s puzzling dip in form : he has n’t scored in the @entity47 since january 12			1
there does n’t appear to be a quick fix to @entity80 ’s problems			0
the former @entity97 man works hard , covers the width of the 18 - yard box with more gusto than @entity7 , but simply is n’t as productive with it			1
it is easier to laud @entity80			0
he looks to be putting more effort in , wins more in the air and is more comfortable with the intricacy of @entity69 and @entity70 in behind			0
but he has lost the knack of scoring goals			1
@entity7 has it , so he is given the shirt			0
two at @entity32 , the first at @entity31 , two at @entity115 , the only goal at home against @entity31 and nudging @entity15 back ahead against @entity118 last month have all been very important goals			1
tactician : @entity121 has worked out how to get the best out of @entity7 @entity68 has it spot on			0
the former @entity125 striker is n’t the archetypal front man for a side so insistent on beauty , but has carried the can while @entity48 ’s been absent			1
@entity130 is to play through teams , @entity132 to go a touch more direct			0
@entity7 clearly suits the latter and - with a fully fit @entity135 - is a threat off the bench			1
an expensive threat , but one nonetheless			0
from the start though , and this has been the case since the move to @entity142 in 2011 , his work is often unseen and underappreciated			0
put politely it is n’t obvious and flashy enough to be the topic of praise down the pub after games			0
that said , he can be frustratingy inconsistent			0
there is an argument that you ought to expect more bang for your buck			0
hotshot : @entity7 's strike - partner @entity48 has had a disrupted season through injury in a microcosm , @entity7 is both the reason why @entity15 should win the league and why they have n’t already won it with ease			1
failing @entity161 is unlikely to have serious ramifications for the club - unless @entity164 do n’t fancy some of @entity164 ’s top sides in the @entity166 - but their spending may have to be curbed			2
you ’d expect @entity7 to still be turning in to training from @entity171 ’s leafy lanes come july for that reason alone			0
interestingly , both @entity173 and @entity174 have bemoaned their striking options this season			2
what both would n’t give for someone like @entity7			0
he might have won them the title .			0

@entity183 has scored *24* goals in all competitions this season
