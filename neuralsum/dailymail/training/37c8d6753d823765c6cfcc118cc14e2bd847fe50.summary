they may be going head to head to open for @entity2 in the @entity3 this summer , but it was honours even after day one of the fight as @entity7 and @entity8 both cracked hundreds for @entity9 on monday			1
on day one of a three - day game against a @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity2 racked up 361 for four in 90 overs			1
the third man in the frame to partner @entity16 against @entity17 — @entity20 opener @entity18 — also impressed with 82 not out			1
@entity21 ’s @entity7 and @entity20 ’s @entity8 combined superbly to put on 176 for the first wicket			1
@entity7 was slightly the more fluent on a slow pitch with some excellent square cuts among his 12 fours as well as an fine straight hit for his sole six			1
he reached 109 off 152 balls before retiring			2
@entity7 ( pictured in july , 2014 ) scored 109 off of 152 balls before retiring against @entity11 @entity8 ( pictured in december ) also scored a century on the first day of the three - day game @entity8 played some lovely cover drives and reached his ton with a leg - side flick for four			1
his 106 came off 171 balls before he retired			2
@entity34 returned to the crease in @entity2 colours for the first time since his horror tour @entity39 last winter			1
@entity34 is @entity9 captain but could not begin his campaign with significant runs			0
he fell for six , caught behind by his opposite number @entity43 off teenager @entity44 , who has played one first - class match			0
@entity47 was then just the second authentic departure of the day , caught at cover off medium - pacer @entity50 after he had made seven			2
but @entity18 , with an attractive 82 not out off 132 balls , put on an undefeated 86 for the fifth wicket with yet another @entity20 batter , @entity54 , who finished 32 not out			0
@entity18 launched his 13th ball off the splendidly named left - arm spinner @entity58 for six but was then dropped at short leg			0

the @entity72 were 182 for three in their second innings when @entity71 , who top - scored with 74 , was dismissed			0
that prompted a clatter of wickets and the visitors were skittled for 215			0

they closed on nine for one , needing another 115 runs for victory today .			0
