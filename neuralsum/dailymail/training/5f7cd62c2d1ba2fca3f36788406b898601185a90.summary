neither @entity0 nor @entity1 could take advantage of the @entity4 ’s slip - up against @entity5 and go top of @entity7 of the @entity8 , as the sides played out the tournament ’s fifth 1 - 1 draw in the first eight games			1
@entity14 ’s late equalizer denied @entity1 all three points , cancelling out @entity17 ’s opener , and leaving all four teams level after the first round of matches			1
in a game of few chances but plenty of heavy tackling it was always likely to take a set - piece or a defensive error to break the deadlock – in the end , the opening goal had an element of both			2
@entity0 and @entity32 defender @entity14 ( left ) celebrates his late equaliser @entity34 of @entity1 celebrates his opening goal in the second half against @entity0 in @entity37 @entity1 's @entity38 - who plays for @entity39 - heads the ball towards goal @entity42 of @entity0 ( right ) is challenged by @entity1 's @entity43 in the feisty encounter when a deep free kick was pumped into the box , not only did the @entity0 defence fail to deal with it first time , but they also allowed yatabare an incredible amount of time and space at the far post to collect the second ball			1
the @entity56 winger stayed calm , brought the ball down with his chest , before smashing it past @entity60			0
but despite keeping @entity0 at arm ’s length for the vast majority of the game , @entity1 could not hold on for the win , as @entity68 ’s superb pass six minutes from time split the defence , and @entity69 finished coolly past @entity70			1
@entity1 thought they had a winner , and yatabare his second , when he headed home the rebound from @entity79 ’s stoppage time free kick , but he was rightly adjudged to be offside			0
@entity80 is challenged by @entity1 's @entity81 ( left ) as the game became a heated affair for the fourth day in a row the stadium – this time a 35,000 - seater in @entity5 ’s capital @entity37 - was not just full to capacity but packed well beyond , and a raucus atmosphere helped to make up for a disappointing lack of quality in attacking areas			1
@entity0 enjoyed most of the possession in the early stages , but it was @entity1 who had more clear - cut chances throughout			0
@entity39 winger @entity38 was always a threat , his combination of pace and power giving @entity0 full back @entity101 a torrid time			0
@entity104 of @entity0 and @entity1 's @entity79 ( left ) go head - to - head as both teams searched for a winner it was @entity38 who had the game ’s first chance , exchanging passes with @entity113 before @entity38 bursting into the box and forcing a good save from keeper with a powerful shot			2
from the resultant corner @entity117 should really have made it 1 - 0 , meeting a cross at the back post but heading wide from close range			0
the @entity39 man , one of very few to run purposefully in a game full of lateral passes , also forced @entity125 into a good save at his near post after powering past @entity14 again , but he might have been better served picking out @entity117 in the centre			0
@entity0 captain @entity128 saw a powerful header tipped over by @entity70 in the first half , while @entity132 forward @entity131 dragged a shot across the face of goal in the second , but for the most part @entity0 , unbeaten in qualifying , produced very little going forward until @entity14 ’s dramatic equalizer .			2

@entity1 *midfielder* @entity34 scored the opening goal of the game
it was a *physical* affair with both teams *refusing* to hold back in the tackle
@entity14 saved the day for @entity0 with a late equaliser
@entity34 scored a 90th minute goal but was judged offside by officials
the drama continued into added time as @entity0 had a *penalty* shout , but again the offside flag was up
