a shoulder injury to @entity1 means @entity2 is likely to find himself at the heart of @entity5 's defence at @entity6 on saturday - and the @entity8 international has a plan			1
the 25 - year - old midfielder has been used to plug a hole in the centre of @entity14 's defence already this season and @entity2 wants to use the performance of his former club @entity17 as inspiration for leaving the @entity19 with a positive result			1
@entity1 , who has recently penned a new long - term deal at @entity22 , dislocated a shoulder in training on thursday and joins fellow defender @entity25 on the injury list - with forwards @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity30 also likely to miss out and @entity31 nursing a slight knee injury			0
@entity5 midfielder @entity2 ( right ) is looking forward to facing @entity6 at the @entity19 stadium @entity1 is one of three defenders who are unavailable for saturday 's @entity36 clash add to that @entity38 's ineligibility against his parent club , and @entity14 will be selecting from a much - depleted pool for a fourth successive @entity36 @entity42 derby			1
but @entity2 was in the crowd as his previous side @entity17 recovered from a 3 - 0 half - time deficit to take a @entity47 point home from north @entity42 and he wants to follow in the footsteps of the @entity51 outfit			1
' i have never played at the @entity19 before , but i know i will play my game and try to enjoy it			0
i want to help the team and battle for the points , ' he told whufc.com ' @entity6 is a very big team , but @entity5 need the points			2
it 's a very good game and @entity42 derby , which i like			0
i 'll go to @entity6 to do battle			0
' i went to the @entity19 to support @entity17 in the @entity47 earlier this season and they did very well and drew three - all			1
@entity2 went to the @entity19 to watch his former club anderlect secure a dramatic 3 - 3 draw in november the @entity65 were stunned as the @entity51 side came from 3 - 0 down to grab a point in the @entity47 ' i was very happy because @entity17 is my second family			1
@entity6 went 3 - 0 up and i was thinking " what is this game ? " but in the second half @entity17 came with a new mentality			2
' it went to 3 - 1 , then 3 - 2 and then 3 - 3 - it was unbelievable ! ' i am very happy for @entity17 , but now @entity5 go to @entity6 and it would be fantastic if we could do the same			1
we want to get a draw or even a win			0
' the @entity5 confirmed on friday morning that @entity1 required hospital treatment as he became the latest player ruled out of @entity14 's squad			2
' @entity5 can confirm that @entity1 has suffered a dislocated shoulder			2
the 25 - year - old was taken for hospital treatment and will continue to be assessed by the club 's medical staff , ' they wrote over two tweets			0
@entity2 , pictured with @entity90 's @entity89 , says @entity5 are aiming for a ' a draw or even a win ' @entity2 enjoyed a short stint at the heart of @entity5 's defence alongside @entity1 due to injuries earlier in the year - scoring against @entity97 and quickly adapting to the role			1
it is likely he will return to that position for the trip to @entity6 , with the highly - rated but inexperienced @entity102 another option			0
in attack , @entity29 and @entity27 are missing with respective hamstring and knee problems , whilst @entity107 is a doubt having suffered a deep cut to his toe after standing on a broken teacup			0
the number of key first - team players in the treatment room will no doubt be a worry to @entity14 who has seen his side win just one of their last 11 @entity36 fixtures .			0

@entity5 take on @entity6 at the @entity19 on saturday , kick - off at *3pm*
@entity2 watched @entity17 draw with the @entity65 in november
the midfielder wants the @entity5 to put in a similar performance
