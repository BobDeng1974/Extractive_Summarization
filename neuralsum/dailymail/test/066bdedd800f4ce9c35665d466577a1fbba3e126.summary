it seems like an idyllic smattering , with nothing more to worry about than sun , sea , sand and where the next cocktail is coming from			0
but one organisation is asking tourists to investigate before heading to the exclusive holiday destination to ensure they are not visiting a resort associated with human rights abuses			1
known for pristine beaches and crystal clear water , the @entity13 has recently come under scrutiny after the country 's former president , @entity17 , was found guilty of terrorism charges earlier this year			0
@entity20 is encouraging tourists to boycott ' high risk ' resorts linked to human rights abuses now , the @entity20 is encouraging tourists to consider the instability in the region when booking their accommodation			1
the @entity29 has crafted a list of over 100 well - known hotels and is urging visitors to consult the guide before travelling			1
although very little detail is provided when it comes to the @entity29 's rationale for dubbing certain resorts to be ' high risk , ' it has colour - coded the hotels into three categories			1
those to be avoided are labelled red , those coded as green are considered to be ' low risk ' and orange hued businesses are ' under consideration			1
' ' while okay to visit in the short term , there is a possibility that they will be on the ' to avoid ' list in the longer term , ' the website reads			2
' therefore , early reservations for visits later in the year should be avoided			0
' the group claims that the ' red ' or ' orange ' resorts are directly or indirectly linked to human rights abuses			2
hotels are coded as ' low risk , ' ' high risk , or ' under consideration ' depending on their ties to corruption by boycotting , the alliance hopes that tourists will help to make a difference in protecting and promoting democracy , while not adversely effecting the @entity73 economy			1
' with a long and sad history of corruption , political oppression and human rights abuses , @entity13 ' first attempts at democratic reform are now faltering , ' a statement on the @entity29 's website reads			2
crime is reportedly on the rise as a result of support for ' extreme gangs , ' which are supported by police to suppress any dissent			0
' uncontrolled corruption starting at the very top of all branches of government filters down through all levels of society , making life very difficult for the average @entity73			2
' though most resorts are categorised as ' low risk , ' @entity96 is listed as one to avoid while most resorts are categorised as ' low risk , ' several top name hotels have been included on the @entity29 's list of those to avoid			1
among them , the @entity96			1
' @entity13 evaluates resorts and other businesses on ethics - based criteria , ' the website reads			0
' these include owners ' support for governments that perpetuate corruption , intimidation and oppression , measures relevant to the environment and social responsibility			0
' in response to allegations presented by @entity121 , the @entity122 of the @entity13 told @entity123 : ' resorts appear to be categorised not on the basis of any practices in their resorts , but on the basis of alleged links of their owners to the government of the @entity13			0
' with only two resort groups targeted and very little information about the identities of those behind ' the @entity20 , ' it is difficult to discern the true intentions and objectives of the website			0
' over the past months , the @entity13 ' young democratic institutions have proven themselves in challenging circumstances , while the government of the @entity13 has maintained a positive , engagement - first approach with international stakeholders			0
' the government of the @entity13 will always remain committed to promoting development , human rights and the ethical values that we all hold dear			0
' @entity123 has reached out to both the @entity20 and a spokesperson for the @entity96 resort for comment .			1
