this meeting is fast turning into a gala performance by the double act of @entity4 champion trainer @entity3 and his @entity6 counterpart @entity5			2
having seen @entity3 , ably assisted by stable jockeys @entity9 and @entity10 , smash the home team on tuesday with four winners headed by his champion @entity13 , it was @entity5 ’ turn on wednesday			2
he won the feature £ 350,000 @entity17 with @entity18 as well as the @entity19 with @entity20 , both ridden by stable jockey @entity22 , and the @entity23 with @entity24 , the mount of @entity26			1
dodging @entity18 ( front ) delivered a second winner of day two for jockey @entity22 with @entity3 also landing the @entity32 with @entity34 - ridden @entity33 , the two dominant stables in jump racing have now won eight of the @entity37 races run so far			1
@entity5 denied he had driven home on tuesday depressed or frustrated having drawn a blank in the face of the @entity42 ’ mullering			2
but the mood for the journey home last night must have been some contrast			2
almost amazingly , @entity18 ’ one - and - a - quarter length defeat of 33 - 1 shot @entity47 was the first steeplechase @entity5 had won at this meeting since @entity50 landed the @entity51			1
back in third was @entity4 - trained front - runner @entity53 but the big two — 2013 winner @entity56 and last year ’s champion @entity57 — blew out			1
trainer @entity58 and jockey son @entity59 felt the ground had dried out too much for fourth - placed @entity61 , who has endured an injury - plagued season while @entity56 , a spent force by the home turn , was pulled up before the last by his jockey @entity65			1
@entity22 and @entity18 successfully clear a fence on their way to victory @entity22 laps up the applause as he is led in after winning the @entity70 his trainer @entity71 said there was no evidence @entity56 ’s old fibrillating heart problem had affected his gelding and a scope examination showed no signs of a significant blood vessel break			1
however , the feeling was an old breathing issue might have re-surfaced			2
there will be no snap decisions but there must be a chance he has run his last race			1
@entity71 said : ‘ it is disappointing for everybody who has worked their socks off to get him back			2
’ the outcome once again showed how hard it is to come back and the result had echoes of the 2010 @entity95 won by @entity96 when the focus was on the @entity5 - trained pair of @entity50 and @entity99			2
this time it was the turn of 9 - 2 shot @entity18 , winner of this season ’s @entity102 and @entity104 , to be cold - shouldered in the build - up as the spotlight fell on the big two			1
and there to cheer him home was his breeder , three - time champion flat jockey @entity122 , looking like he should be part of @entity113 ’s crew in his brown trilby and mac. he hoped he was breeding a future @entity117 winner when he sent the mare @entity119 to the stallion @entity121			0
he ended up producing the victor of one the season ’s biggest jumps races			0
@entity122 said : ‘ i am only a small part in this amazing story but i am so pleased for @entity5 and the owners			0
i can say i have bred the best jumps horse of 2015			0
’ dodging @entity18 returned at 9 - 2 after landing the @entity70 @entity22 celebrates with the @entity70 trophy the result was no surprise to @entity5 , who said : ‘ he was the form horse			1
he beat @entity56 at @entity135 and i could n’t see how he could turn that around			1
with all due respect to @entity58 , i also thought @entity61 had it all to do			1
he has had a problem			0
‘ i can see the sentiment side of it but the progressive horse normally comes out on top			0
i was fairly confident i had them covered , @entity139 was the one i was getting worried about and he was a non-runner			0
’ @entity5 puts @entity146 ’ improvement this year down to greater maturity and solving a gastric ulcer problem , as he has with tomorrow ’s @entity95 favourite @entity150			0
this success can only serve to strengthen both stable and punter confidence in his chance			0
@entity5 added : ‘ we felt he was losing his way but could n’t work out why			0
we found the gastric ulcer , treated for that , and like @entity150 he is a different animal			0
he won the best turned out award and it was as well as he has been			0
’ the results were also further vindication of @entity5 ’s decision to hand the pressure job of stable jockey to 22 - year - old @entity22 at the start of the season , a move made earlier than expected when others threatened to sign him up			1
@entity5 heeded advice from former @entity174 boss sir @entity173			0
‘ he said , “ you do n’t want the best striker in the league playing for another team			0
” someone said @entity22 will last me until i retire			1
i do n’t know if he will last that long but he is a good lad who will be part of the team for a long time			0
’ a bad day for @entity71 was made worse when @entity184 suffered a fatal injury in the @entity19			2
it was all smiles for the connections of @entity18 @entity122 ( second right ) could n't hide his excitement after dodging @entity18 ' victory			1
