@entity0 was shocked to be handed the managerial position at @entity2 , according to his former @entity4 player @entity3			1
@entity0 signed a six - year contract at @entity6 after receiving a call from sir @entity8 in 2013 - only to be sacked 11 months later as @entity2 limped to their lowest - ever @entity10 finish			1
in extracts from his autobiography published in the @entity13 , @entity3 revealed : ‘ after it was confirmed , @entity0 called six of the senior players to meet him in the @entity17 in @entity18 – myself , @entity20 ( @entity19 ) , @entity22 ( @entity21 ) , @entity24 ( @entity23 ) , @entity26 ( @entity25 ) and @entity27			1
@entity3 was pleased for @entity0 after his @entity4 manager revealed he was leaving for @entity2 @entity0 was handed the @entity6 top job after being called to sir @entity8 's house @entity31 was sacked after 11 months in charge following dismal results ‘ we all congratulated him and told him he had earned a move like that for all his effort and what he ’d done for the club			1
he sat us down and told us it was n’t planned but that he ’d received a phone call from sir @entity8 , who asked to meet him and then told him he wanted him to be the next manager of @entity2			2
‘ @entity44 looked us straight in the eyes and told us he had n’t expected the offer			0
i absolutely believe what he told us			0
for me , he ran his contract down so it was easier to get offers like that but i genuinely do n’t believe he had @entity2 on his mind			2
’ @entity0 walks out to a standing ovation on his final match as @entity4 manager at @entity56 former @entity4 forward @entity57 grabbed a share of the limelight during @entity0 ' and @entity19 's send off @entity3 also disclosed how the former @entity4 manager 's final game at @entity56 was slightly overshadowed by @entity62 forward @entity57 getting in on the act			1
‘ he was given a fantastic send - off by our fans and it was really fitting			0
‘ our manager who has been there for 11 years ( came out on to the pitch after @entity19 who was retiring )			0
that should have been it but who comes on the pitch last ? @entity57 ! i just could n’t believe it			2
‘ @entity27 should have declined the offer in my opinion			0
he ’d been unbelievable for @entity4 , one of the best signings ever , but that was @entity20 and @entity44 ’s moment and not his .			0
