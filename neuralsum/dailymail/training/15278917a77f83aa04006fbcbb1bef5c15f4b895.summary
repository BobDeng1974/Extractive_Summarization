by @entity0 like many artists , @entity1 paints the things he sees around him			1
this is why his paintings are inspired by dizzyingly high precipices , towering piles of sofas , cartoon animals and even @entity12 dolls that have come to life			2
but in fact , @entity1 is completely blind			1
the 66 - year - old from @entity16 , @entity17 , lost his sight after a near - fatal bout of meningitis that damaged his optic nerve seven years ago			1
but instead of experiencing only darkness , he lives amid a vivid world of hallucinatory visions			2
his illness has left him with a strange , but surprisingly common , condition called @entity28 syndrome			2
painting in the dark : artist @entity1 , 66 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , lives amid a vivid world of hallucinatory visions , despite being completely blind an estimated two million people in @entity33 experience often bizarre visual hallucinations , according to the @entity35			1
often these are caused by @entity28 syndrome , which is named after an 18th - century @entity37 scientist and philosopher who identified the condition in his grandfather , who was nearly blind from cataracts			1
such visual hallucinations are most commonly are associated with medical conditions affecting the brain or vision , such as @entity47 ’s , dementia and the relatively common eye condition , macular degeneration			1
the latter develops when the macula , the part of the eye responsible for central vision , starts to fail			2
it is most commonly age - related , and some 460,000 @entity33 suffer from it — with around one in five of those thought to develop @entity28 syndrome			2
another world : one of mr @entity1 's paintings , drawn from his hallucinations after his blindness when a person suddenly loses his or her sight , the brain can start to overcompensate for blindness by filling blank spots with stored images			1
however , because of lack of research so far , relatively little is yet known about the syndrome — let alone how it can be treated			2
sufferers and medical professionals can be reluctant to discuss it , for fear that the hallucinations are a sign of insanity			1
in 2006 , @entity1 , a divorced father of three grown - up boys , was working in the printing industry			1
in his spare time , the fine - arts graduate painted portraits and surreal art. but one saturday morning , he came down with an intense headache			2
‘ i put up with it for the whole weekend then struggled into work on monday , ’ he remembers			2
‘ my colleagues took one look at my awful state and sent me to my gp			2
’ he barely managed to get there before collapsing in the consulting room			2
@entity1 was rushed to an intensive care unit , but lapsed into a coma			1
‘ i was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis , ’ he says			2
he was put on a life - support machine and his family were warned he ’d most probably be left brain - dead			2
after three weeks , however , @entity1 began to rouse			1
‘ i was in a terrible state , ’ he says			0
but although his sight had gone , @entity1 emerged into a strange world of terrifying images and bizarrely cartoonish apparitions			1
‘ while i was in a neurological rehabilitation unit in hospital , i kept seeing myself on the edge of a precipice like a big , craggy bay			0
there was the feeling you could just tip off , ’ he remembers			0
the doctors had told him that he was blind , and so he understood this to be a hallucination , but still it was an extremely disturbing visitation			1
‘ i got my sons to take me from room to room to get away from it , but i just got different views of the same frightening thing			0
i could also see a dry riverbed below , and felt certain that it would flood and carry me off			0
’ @entity1 feared that he was about to lose his mind entirely			1
‘ it scared the nurses too , ’ he says			0
‘ one instructed me not to tell anyone about the hallucinations , for fear that i would be sectioned under the @entity133			1
’ eventually , a specialist confirmed that @entity1 had @entity28 syndrome , as a result of optical nerve damage in his brain			1
@entity139 life : @entity28 sufferers often see grotesque disembodied faces , bizarre figures in elaborate costume , nonsense text and letter strings and extended landscape scenes it is believed that in such cases , the brain can start to overcompensate for blindness by filling blank spots with stored images			1
these may be confabulated from life , from film or tv , from books or radio			0
‘ i know now that i can handle the visions , because i understand that it is my brain playing tricks on me , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ some of the images i see are really entertaining , like cartoon animals , ’ he says			0
‘ if i wave my arms at them , they even flinch			0
it is a surreal world			0
a hallucination of a sofa becomes a flight of stairs and then i see someone standing on the top of them			0
’ @entity1 has spoken to other people with @entity28 syndrome and found remarkable similarities in their hallucinations — such as seeing @entity12 dolls coming to life			1
many sufferers ’ hallucinations can also range from simple patterns and colours to grotesque disembodied faces , bizarre figures in elaborate costume , nonsense text and letter strings and extended landscape scenes			1
in fact , hallucinations seem to be far more common than most of us would acknowledge			1
grief hallucinations , for example , may affect the majority of bereaved people			1
these ghostly visions of dead partners , friends or pets are often experienced by bereaved people shortly after their loss			0
a study from the @entity204 , @entity205 , found that more than 80 per cent of older people experience hallucinations associated with their dead partner one month after the bereavement			1
the ghosts seemed to be so real that they heard them and spoke to them			0
the ghostly visits were commonly felt to be a ‘ helpful and comforting experience ’ , said the researchers			0
one much rarer condition is @entity219 ’s peduncular hallucinosis			0
this involves bizarre visual hallucinations , such as strange - looking chickens and people attired in odd costumes			1
the condition is caused by a lesion in a patient ’s midbrain , caused either by accident or disease			0
the hallucinations are believed to occur because the midbrain is associated with the faculty of vision			1
despite its relatively widespread nature , @entity28 syndrome remains essentially a medical mystery			0
@entity239 imagination : @entity1 suffers from @entity28 syndrome , as a result of the damage in his brain and now makes art from his hallucinations now the @entity35 , at @entity245 , has launched an in - depth investigation into how it may best be treated			1
dr @entity247 , a consultant psychiatrist and expert in visual hallucinations , is joint leader of the £ 1.9 million initiative			1
as he explains : ‘ despite the large numbers of people suffering from distressing hallucinations , there is no clear evidence that any treatments actually work			1
’ he believes this is partly because no one has previously taken an over-arching view of the condition			0
‘ depending on whether the hallucinations are a symptom of conditions such as @entity265 ’s , @entity47 ’s or eye disease , you might be treated by a psychiatrist , neurologist or ophthalmologist , often with very different advice on how there might be any way to treat the condition			1
’ his project aims to understand more clearly what causes visual hallucinations and identify which treatments work best for which patients			1
he hopes that this will ultimately improve @entity282 care			0
in the meantime , though , sufferers can still be faced by ignorance			0
indeed , the @entity286 , a charity campaigning for people with sight loss , has been urging ophthalmologists and opticians to warn patients with the condition that they have at least a 20 per cent chance of developing @entity28 syndrome			2
‘ it is extraordinary that so many people do n’t know about this condition , ’ says the charity ’s spokeswoman , @entity295			0
‘ sufferers can fear that they are going mad as well as blind			2
‘ most people can cope with it well , once they know what is happening to them			0
but some suffer quite horrifying hallucinations , for no apparent reason			2
for example , one woman saw her dead husband ’s disembodied head on the pillow next to her			0
other people see huge snakes or insects			0
’ for @entity1 , though , the hallucinations have positively helped him to find purpose in his life post-blindness			1
moreover , he has been able to sell his pictures through professional exhibitions			0
‘ a lot of my art work is trying to make sense of my @entity28 hallucinations , ’ he says			2
‘ when i left hospital after nine months , i started trying to draw like i used to do			0
but now it is a different ball game			0
i can not now let the pen or pencil leave the paper			0
if i do , i am lost			2
’ to get an idea of how his finished paintings look , @entity1 relies on feedback from sighted people , including his sons and professional carers who look after him every day			1
‘ people have told me that my work is inspirational			0
but i had the drive to do it anyway , ’ he says			0
‘ before the illness , i had planned to take up painting fully again when i retired			0
it ’s what keeps me going			0
