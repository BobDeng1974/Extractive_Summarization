after he declined a third debaucherous dinner at @entity6 's home and his fellow models attended without him , @entity0 says he got an unsettling phone call from his unnamed friend from inside the house after she believes she was drugged by the comedian			1
that friend would go on to become a witness called @entity35 8 in @entity37 's 2005 sexual assault lawsuit against @entity6 , which never went to trial			1
she , along with @entity0 , separately recounted their stories from 1984 to the @entity42			2
she was whispering , ' @entity0 recalled to the @entity42			0
' she said , " @entity0 , you 've got to come get me			0
" ' @entity0 told the site he had been working for the modeling agency @entity45 , an agency with reported ties to @entity6 , when he was flown to @entity49 for work			1
he said he and his fellow models were invited to dine with the actor at his @entity54 brownstone on tony 61st street twice			1
' why would @entity6 care less about these young girls coming from these modeling agencies ? that was how he was casting extras on his show ? ' that right there seemed ridiculous			2

scene : @entity0 says his unnamed friend , who worked with him at @entity45 -- a modeling agency with purported ties to @entity6 -- called him in a daze from inside @entity6 's @entity24 brownstone ( pictured ) in 1984 @entity6 was at the cusp of breaking out as @entity76 's most beloved tv dad in 1984 when @entity0 says he and his model agency friends were invited to his @entity49 home several time			1
@entity0 says the night his friends went without him is when things took a turn after an uncomfortable experience in which he claims @entity6 first tried setting him up with a married female pilot -- and another when he says @entity6 very pointedly made clear he was his home 's @entity84 -- @entity0 chose to turn down a third invitation to dine with @entity6			1

' @entity92 was served like water , ' said the woman , who 's now 53 and a successful business owner in @entity96			0
' we were all young — in our twenties — and felt honored to be having dinner with @entity6 , ' she said , but then she said he tried to kiss her and things took a turn			0
' i called @entity0 to come get me , ' she said			2
' this was after @entity6 tried to kiss me			0
i was amazed , and quite disgusted ( since he was close to my @entity105 ’s age and smelled like a cigar )			0
' i do recall that i felt out of control			0
' concerned both about how strung out his friend seemed on the phone and with what would become of him , a nobody , if he came barging into a superstar 's home , @entity0 told the @entity42 he knew he had to help his friend			1
another model : former model @entity21 ( right and left ) also worked for @entity45 and years ago admitted she had an affair with @entity6 after meeting him with @entity0 and his friend after they were invited to @entity6 's home for a night of dinner and boozing			1

' i made quite a racket			0
i wanted to get in			0
' when @entity6 finally answered , @entity0 said he seemed unfazed by his apparent intrusion and merely asked what the problem was			2
' there ’s a big problem here , ' @entity0 said			0
' those girls are going with me right now ! ' he claims went into the house and eventually found his friend clothed but disheveled and practically incoherent			2
' after @entity0 collected me , ' the friend told the @entity42 , ' i was virtually incoherent			2
at the time , i was in a long - term relationship , but remember ( with shame ) that i called out for @entity0 after returning to the company apartment			2
to this day , i am still embarrassed by my behavior			0
' @entity0 said he never saw @entity21 at the home and they left without her that night			0
@entity21 has since gone public about what she called her brief affair with @entity6 when she was a model in 1984			2
