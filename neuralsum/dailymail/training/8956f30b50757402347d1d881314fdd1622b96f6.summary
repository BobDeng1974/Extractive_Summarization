mr @entity44 , a retired bricklayer , said : ' we are amazed at the response from people			2
it was n’t a planned thing , @entity50 and i were walking through town to boots when we stopped to listen to a busker			2
' he was playing a medley of lovely ballroom tunes and i could sense @entity50 moving her feet			1
i was tapping along and just said to her " may i take this dance ? " and that was that			2
' i suppose we got carried away but people were cheering and clapping and we just went along with it			0
it was a lovely sunny day and the shoppers seemed to like it			2
' the busker had no idea what we were doing but kept on playing			0
' just hours after the two - minute clip of their dancing was uploaded to @entity42 , the video attracted more than 2,000 hits the couple , who live in @entity14 , have been together for 40 years but have never married			1
@entity11 added : ' we have both started dancing when we were about 14			1
' we actually met ballroom dancing about 40 years ago at the @entity77 on @entity78			1
' we got to know each other and have been dancing ever since			0
we used to do it a lot more but there are n’t so many places to do it any more , that ’s why we took our opportunity in the city centre			0
' i hope to see even more people catch the dancing bug - and perhaps start quick - dancing down their streets too			0
' @entity50 , who has two children from a previous marriage , added : ' we watch @entity12 together every week when it is on , and we are very nimble for our age			0
' we do the cha cha , waltz , fox trot , samba , the quick step , we do them all			0
' we used to go to the @entity102 to dance but they prefer the bigger shows like gigs and famous performers so there are not as many dance nights as there used to be , which is a real shame			2
' it is something we miss. ' shopper @entity113 , 25 , who filmed the dancing duo , said : ' i was just out shopping with a friend and saw them and it touched my heart that they are still in love with dancing , and each other , after all these years			0
