by @entity1 medical correspondent fertility scientists have found a new way to identify embryos that will implant in the womb which could boost @entity7 success rates by up to 50 per cent			1
the presence of high levels of @entity10 from energy - producing cells in the embryo is a signal that it will fail to implant and produce a pregnancy , according to researchers from @entity16			1
they found a threshold , or cut - off point , below which embryos could be guaranteed to implant , and above which some failed to do so			1
the @entity24 investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial dna found in early - stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb each year in @entity34 , clinics carry out about 60,000 ivf treatments but many couples remain childless , often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb			1
this can occur if the embryo is carrying genetic defects , or even if it appears to be healthy			0
it is thought the new finding may explain around one in three implantation failures			0
research scientist dr @entity45 , of the @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 , a specialist group of fertility scientists , said the discovery meant it could be a ‘ new independent biomarker of embryo viability ’ , helping doctors to choose the embryos most likely to result in pregnancy			0
she said most ivf clinics had success rates of 20 - 30 per cent of women having a baby after treatment			1
each year in @entity34 , clinics carry out about 60,000 ivf treatments but many couples remain childless , often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb ( file photo ) this figure could rise to 40 per cent after pre-implantation genetic screening of the egg or embryo for chromosome abnormalities that are a major cause of miscarriages and conditions such as @entity75			1
she said ‘ we believe that adding this biomarker to the process will increase those rates to 50 or 60 per cent			2
‘ it ’s very easy to do , it only takes a couple of hours , and although we have n’t worked out a price yet it will be very cheap , just a few pounds			0
’ she said four or five clinics in the @entity34 and @entity86 were already using the technique free as part of their screening in return for data that could lead to commercial development of a test			1
studies into the technique have not yet been published in a scientific journal but were presented for the first time at the @entity98 of the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) in @entity100			0
the @entity24 investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial dna found in early - stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb			2
@entity10 ( @entity10 ) is genetic material found in the tiny power packs of the cells , or mitochondria , which is contributed by the woman			0
the team of international experts led by dr @entity45 took biopsies from 392 embryos at the five day stage of development when @entity10 levels start rising , generated by couples at eight clinics			2
they also looked at 87 women aged around 38 where the embryo was transferred to the womb , resulting in 44 pregnancies and 48 failures to implant			1
the findings showed high levels of @entity10 in embryos carrying genetic defects and those from older women , especially those over 40			0
the team found healthy embryos capable of implanting in the womb tended to have lower levels of @entity10 than those failing to implant			2
most importantly , they could establish a threshold of @entity10 quantity below which implantation was certain			0
altogether 30 per cent of healthy embryos that failed to implant had quantities of @entity10 above this threshold , while 100 per cent of healthy embryos that produced a pregnancy had levels below it			1
dr @entity45 said it was not clear why high levels of @entity10 should affect implantation , although they are a sign that the embryo may be under stress			0
‘ it suggests there may be a problem , not necessarily in the chromosomes , and extra energy is needed to correct the problem , but it is not really fixable ’ said dr @entity45 .			0

each year in @entity34 , clinics carry out about 60,000 ivf treatments
many couples remain childless because embryo fails to implant in womb
most ivf clinics had success rates of 20 - 30 per cent of women having a baby after treatment .
