it is a medical marvel @entity1 made it to this interview			1
the 25 - year - old has , like many others , just completed a bachelors degree and started the process of working out what to do next			1
but less than five years ago , in the early hours of @entity10 2010 , he was in a coma , his skull shattered into 30 pieces after he and his friends were hit by a car that had careered off the road			1
horrific : @entity1 , 25 , pictured left this year , less than five years after he was slammed into a coma , right , by a speeding driver in the early hours of @entity10 2010 , leaving him with permanent brain damage tragic : @entity1 , pictured months before with love interest @entity20 , who never awoke from her coma the crash near @entity25 ’s north circular killed his 20 - year - old friend @entity26 instantly			1
his new love interest , @entity20 , 19 , never woke up from her coma			1
for more than three months doctors repeatedly warned his parents that @entity1 would probably wake up but could never lead an independent life			1
on a scale of one to 15 , his coma was rated three : the lowest point at which you have a chance of survival			2
he suffered a diffuse axonal head injury , which left him with severe amnesia and ataxia , which affects muscle coordination and speech			2
at first - before a grueling five - hour operation to replace his skull with nine titanium plates and 33 screws - @entity1 's injuries had also completely altered his appearance			1
incredibly , after a bitter legal battle and years of intensive therapy , he has a degree , his own place and has written a book about his journey battling a brain injury			1
still , it is a struggle to describe the moment he came to			0
‘ i thought that i must just be having some vivid nightmare , ’ he told @entity57			0
‘ although i can not definitively know how long this lasted , i refused to believe that my situation had really occurred for well over six months			2
’ @entity61 : then aged 21 , @entity1 had been in his final year of an @entity63 degree at the @entity64			1
he was leaving a party with @entity66 , their friend @entity67 and two others in @entity69 , north @entity25 , when they were hit before : @entity1 , pictured months before the accident , said he was in denial for months after the crash travels : @entity1 traveled to @entity74 ( pictured ) and @entity75 during his holidays from university before the accident devastation : doctors warned his parents @entity1 would never be able to lead an independent life when he awoke @entity1 woke up in april 2010 , unable to walk , talk , or eat			1
he had no idea how old he was and was shocked that his parents were so young			0
when doctors tried to test his memory , he could only identify objects in @entity86			2
almost immediately , his parents - classroom assistant @entity87 , 56 , and shipping lawyer @entity87 , 57 - delivered the crushing news that @entity66 and @entity67 were dead			0
' words failed me , ' @entity1 explains			2
' i was utterly devastated			0
' it must have been incredibly difficult for people to have told me the news and luckily my parents always dismissed the view that they should n't tell me about @entity66 and @entity67 's deaths			0
' i had begun to ask the questions and if they 'd kept things from me , i 'd feel betrayal and massive lasting resentment			0
' shattered : this is @entity1 's x-ray showing how his skull was shattered into 30 pieces			1
a surgeon dedicated himself to rebuilding @entity1 's face using nine titanium plates and 33 metal screws in a five - hour operation @entity1 had been on the cusp of completing his @entity63 degree at the @entity64 after three years of study			1
but the accident changed everything			0
however , after defying expectations by surviving the crash , he was determined to get his life back on track			2
he started with nine months at the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , a neurological rehabilition centre in @entity121 , where he started constructing plans to return to @entity123 , prosecute the driver that killed his two friends , and reclaim his rightful compensation			1
‘ i had a robust desire to prove myself , ' he said			0
' this need to validate myself has long relented along with more painfully accepting gradually that a brain injury shall always exist as something for me to have to work around			1
' it started with a bitter legal battle - first to convict the driver @entity135 , who was found guilty of two counts of deaths by dangerous driving and jailed for seven years			1
then @entity1 had to endure a fight to prove to the @entity140 that he was mentally fit to control his own compensation money , which @entity135 was ordered to pay			1
the controversial system has jurisdiction over the property , financial affairs and personal welfare of people who it claims lack mental capacity to make decisions for themselves			0
but negotiating to reclaim his money , @entity1 discovered , was no simple process			1
' paradox is a word that i use frequently throughout my book and the @entity140 is an ultimate example of this ; it ’s acting in your interest , but getting full control of your money returned is an arduous process			1
' with the assistance of the @entity119 , i was removed from the @entity140 at some point in 2011 after a lengthy process of proving that i was fit to handle my own money			2
’ the payment was released in 2011 as @entity1 decided he was finally ready complete the bachelors degree he started in 2007			2
@entity1 is not short of compliments for the @entity64 , which provided him with a library assistant , an @entity63 supervisor , and neurological support to reach his qualification			2
' the @entity64 were fantastic at accommodating my return to studies			0
' learning the futility of trying to recapture my own glorified university experience was tricky at first			0
' ultimately i think that i underestimated the fact that completing an @entity63 and @entity182 degree from the @entity64 is no walk in the park			0
' once i made a tight group of friends that were disconnected from the university and did my degree over a part - time basis , things became good again ! ' he has now written a book detailing his experiences as clearly as he can remember			2
but that night remains a blank in his mind			0
‘ as i suffered from severe amnesia and the entirety of @entity198 2010 continues to be a haze , writing about that was impossible			2
' still i have blurry visions of many moments that could have be recollections from our night , but ca n’t be sure which are just figments of my imagination or based on prompts from evidence or things that i ’ve been told			0
’ it is a major professional and personal landmark that few people in full health could contemplate			0
the release of battling a brain injury : the life that @entity215 , which has been months in the making , gives him something of a boost as he nears the five - year mark			1
success : @entity1 , pictured with his mother @entity87 , was determined to finish his studies and last year was awarded a 2:1 for his bachelor 's degree in @entity63 and @entity182 at the @entity64 , where he is still based today looking forward : having now written a book about his experiences , @entity1 has defied doctors ' expectations but he speaks candidly about the everyday torment he faces simply looking at his tracheotomy scar - which he has colloquially dubbed his ‘ trackey ’			1
‘ scars slap me in the face whenever i look at photographs and obviously whether i have predominantly pride or … @entity236 is n’t the right word , although there is at times a significant amount of discomfort having this scar			0
‘ sometimes it ’s a source of pride and other times i just fail to believe that this is me			0
‘ it is what it is , no choice in the matter			0
’ in a choking blog post , he writes : ' the bitter irony is that i do not even want to identify particularly with those who ’d be able to relate to my situation ; everything about the state that i have been left within is something that i have desperately urged to veer away from			0
' there are certainly optimistic things that have arisen as a result of the catastrophic accident that i was involved in , only i ’ve moved beyond believing that they can ever balance out my horrific ordeals			0
