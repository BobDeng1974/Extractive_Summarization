@entity0 the world champions are out			1
tied first in departing this tournament , with @entity6			2
not in body , because there is still the matter of a meaningless final group game in @entity11 on monday , but mathematically and in spirit			1
they trooped off the pitch in the @entity15 last night , heads bowed , all resistance spent			2
after two games they have no points and a goal difference that reads 1 - 7			1
this truly is a seismic development for football			2
it is the worst defence of a @entity26 title in history , poorer even than @entity28 in @entity29 four years ago			1
they , too , exited at the group stage , but at least their final game was live			1
@entity4 now travel @entity33 a redundant embarrassment			2
nobody wants to be one of those teams , the dead rubberers , fulfilling a fixture list simply because they must			2
this will be the game that many say marks the end of the era of tiki - taka , too , but with that is raised a more existential question			1
was there ever any such thing ? did tiki - taka create a great @entity53 team , or was it merely itself the invention of 11 outstanding players			2
@entity57 ( 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity102 7 ; @entity103 8 , @entity96 7 , @entity104 7 ; @entity105 7 , @entity78 7.5 ( @entity106 64 , 6 ) , @entity107 7 , @entity108 7.5 ; @entity109 7.5 ( @entity110 88 ) ; @entity68 7.5 ( @entity111 85 ) , @entity81 8			1
goals : @entity68 19 , @entity113 43 booked : @entity104 , @entity108			1
referee : @entity115 ( @entity116 ) 7			2
and one in particular : @entity117 of @entity118			0
we think systems make players , but perhaps it is the other way around			0
@entity123 have played great football since the era of @entity126 , but has it ever again been total football ? and @entity4 will no doubt come again – but will it be with tiki - taka , or some new philosophy that simply suits their xi at the time			1
@entity100 is most certainly not a disciple of tiki - taka			1
he is an old - fashioned target man , of the type that every @entity138 n club once had			2
@entity117 , meanwhile , was dropped for this game , having been partly responsible for the 5 - 1 defeat by @entity123 last week			1
in his absence , others tried to recreate @entity4 ’s style , but without success			0
@entity94 had a terrible time and was substituted after 45 minutes			0
they tried to tiki , they tried to taka , but without @entity117 at his peak it just was n’t the same			0
@entity57 were , by contrast , magnificent			0
it would be wrong to say they played without a philosophy , because they were superbly organised , pressed high and upset @entity4 ’s rhythm beautifully			0
yet there is no catchy name for what @entity57 do , no books that are written on its rise , no credit given for changing modern football as @entity4 have done with their three straight tournament wins			0
@entity100 was hardly in the game ... check out more stats here @entity100 's heat map video reigning champions out as @entity57 stampede celebration : the @entity79 side are through to the @entity174 along with @entity123 gol ! the beaten @entity4 players regroup after @entity57 double their lead disappointing : @entity179 's future is now up in the air following the loss despair : @entity183 missed a sitter at the start of the second half acrobatic : it was a wonderful assist by soon - to - be @entity189 striker @entity100 our time : the stadium rise to applaud @entity57 after a wonderful first - half performance @entity194 , an @entity195 , has simply got his team playing excellent , technical , hard - working football of the type that wins big matches , and maybe tournaments , too – unless the big guns of @entity201 buck their ideas up here			1
@entity57 looked better than @entity195 did at the @entity15 on sunday , and were an upgrade on either of @entity33 ’s two performances so far			0
they took their chances , defended manfully , ran to the point of exhaustion and showed great courage after half - time when @entity33 threw the kitchen sink at them			1
it was n’t always comfortable , but it certainly was n’t fortunate			0
what happens now in the final game against @entity123 may depend on how keen either team is to avoid @entity33 , who it is presumed will win @entity219 if both teams go for the top spot in @entity222 on that presumption , it could be one of the matches of the tournament			1
fittingly , the @entity15 is where this @entity26 has found its truest , noisiest expression			1
why @entity33 have avoided coming here until the final , therefore , is a mystery			0
in their absence , the rest of the continent has taken residence – @entity57 raising the decibel level above even the crescendo of @entity195 on sunday			0
and that was before they took a two goal half - time lead against the world champions			1
@entity4 had too much to lose , while @entity57 played like a team that could only be heroes			0
the exclusion of @entity117 and defender @entity246 – but , fatefully , not goalkeeper @entity63 – spoke of the trauma suffered in the five goal defeat to @entity123			1
@entity57 ’s players , by contrast , spent the previous night socialising with friends and family at their beachfront hotel in @entity254			0
in the second minute @entity104 headed an @entity81 corner just wide to roars of approval and the pattern was set			0
@entity57 were not in the least intimidated by this occasion			0
there were here to destroy some serious reputations			0
dejected : @entity63 prepares to walk back onto the pitch after a poor first 45 minutes argument ? the under - fire keeper tries to reason with his disappointed team - mates out on their feet : the @entity53 team looked tired in the second half , and were outrun against @entity57 play acting ? @entity98 is unhappy with the referee after @entity104 rolls on the floor sloppy : @entity101 came off the bench but failed to inspire once again @entity274 , really , considering two of their starting line - up might have been looking out for next season ’s @entity278 fixtures earlier in the day , to see who they would be playing on the first day of the new season			1
@entity104 of @entity282 is at home to @entity284 , @entity285 of @entity286 away at @entity287			0
no wonder they played like men possessed in the @entity15			0
what a moment , what an opportunity , what a possible escape if they can grab the world ’s attention here			2
they certainly did that last night			0
rugged , committed , but highly skilled in attack , @entity57 matched @entity4 ’s possession statistics in some periods of the match and stretched a beleaguered back four to breaking point			0
@entity179 had brought in @entity90 , a holding midfield player by nature , to the heart of defence , but he was hardly convincing			1
@entity94 , equally , was finding it hard to get to grips with @entity57 ’s movement as a defensive screen			0
@entity309 , @entity4 fluffed their lines – none more so than the apple of @entity314 ’s eye , @entity100			1
he had a good chance in the 27th minute , put through by a headed flick from @entity96 , but buried the ball into the pitch and the side - netting			1
indeed , the only time @entity57 ’s goalkeeper @entity102 was needed in the first - half was in the 15th minute when @entity53 aggression forced a goalmouth scramble and he fell on an @entity94 shot from close range , much like @entity327 smothering a grenade			2
blow : the @entity53 players leave the pitch after crashing out of the @entity61 unsuccessful : @entity90 could not inspire a stronger defensive performance stopper : @entity102 does well to keep out @entity99 's late free - kick unhappy return : @entity100 snubbed playing for @entity33 in favour of starting for @entity4 in his home country it was soon after this incident that @entity57 took the lead , by no means against the run of play			1
@entity94 lost the ball and a swift counter attacking move saw @entity78 play a lovely square pass into the path of @entity68			1
he took a touch to control it and , at first , it appeared as if the delay was costly			0
in fact , he was merely moving the ball from his left to his right , and finished with a low shot that gave @entity63 no chance			1
in the 44th minute , @entity57 went two clear			0
@entity81 curled in a free - kick which @entity63 should have taken , but chose to parry instead – the ball flying tamely out to @entity78 who swung a right foot and sent it on a return path to goal			1
goodbye : the @entity53 press report on @entity4 's shock defeat ( left ) as a @entity53 fan reacts at the final whistle form : @entity57 took another step closer to qualification after their impressive 2 - 0 win the second - half followed a predictable pattern , @entity95 on for @entity94 and @entity4 fighting for their lives			1
even so , there was an excellent chance for @entity105 in the 69th minute , when he almost got a foot on a crossfield shot by @entity377			0
for @entity4 , @entity100 missed another fine chance , and then set an equally good one up for @entity183 , with an overhead kick , which was scuffed wide			2
we all know what event the @entity15 is waiting for but , until that day arrives on july 13 , it is hard to believe there will be bedlam louder than the final whistle here			0
@entity57 had torn down the temple of tiki - taka ; or maybe @entity117 had just turned 34 ; or maybe a bit of both			2
pre-match buffet : a sneak peak inside the @entity53 dressing room before the game packed : fans from around the world watch the game at the @entity397 in @entity398			2

world champions dumped out after two shock defeats in @entity222
lost 5 - 1 to @entity123 in first game , @entity63 disappoints once again
@entity179 faces the sack after defeat
fifth holders to be *knocked* out of @entity26 at group stage
@entity68 and @entity78 score goals in first half
@entity100 touches the ball just 21 times
