a female pastor arrested during a peaceful protest in @entity2 last night has told of her shock as she was ' grabbed ' and dragged along the ground so roughly that it tore off her vest marking her out as clergy			1
speaking to @entity10 just hours after her release pastor @entity9 recalled her ordeal and voiced her belief that anyone of conscience should stand with the protesters			1
she said : ' i was completely stunned			1
all i can tell you is what my body experienced			2
my mind at that point was just in shock			2
' i was grabbed so hard that i fell to the ground			1
then i was just being yanked and it was pretty rough			2
' pastor @entity9 's arrest marked the first police action to be taken against protesters following governor @entity30 's declaration of a state of emergency			1
moment of arrest : this is the moment reverend @entity9 was arrested by police			1
she told @entity10 it was after she was grabbed and dragged along the ground concerned : reverend @entity9 said she was demonstrating in @entity2 because she believed people of color are not fairly treated and that it was her duty as a @entity41 to stand with them @entity42 : how @entity43 was dressed for the demonstration			1
she went towards the front , she said , to de-escalate the situation but was arrested the minister for @entity2 's @entity48 was one five protesters arrested for blocking a street outside the police headquarters			2
the handful of protesters were faced down by a line of officers in full riot gear as impatience grows in the city waiting for a @entity60 decision on whether to indict @entity61 for shooting unarmed teenager @entity62 , 18			1
according to @entity43 the group - only numbering around 15 - blocking the road were dispersing when the @entity66 officers moved in			1
she said , ' i think everybody was completely shocked			2
we were dispersing at that point			2
then they came down so i turned around and i thought , ' well i 'm a de-escalator so i need to stay at the front			2
' @entity74 is one of many local clergy who have taken to the streets in an attempt to defuse the volatile relationship between protesters and police that saw the @entity83 town erupt in violence following the shooting on august 9			1
she was wearing a bright orange vest with the word ' @entity89 ' clearly printed across her back			1
today she believes that far from protecting her this made her a target for officers keen to make a point ahead of the violence anticipated when the @entity60 makes its announcement			2
last night 's arrest has been read as a clear message that law enforcement will come down hard on any and all protesters			1
she explained , ' i think it 's noteworthy that they picked three people from the line			2
one was behind me wearing an @entity108 mask			2
one was at the very end and he was wearing an anonymous mask			2
' dragged from the front of the protest , the forty - six year old mother of two was cuffed and put in a police van along with the other arrestees			1
she said , ' as soon as they cuffed me they took me right back to the paddy wagon			2
two men were holding my arms			2
they put me in a van			2
at this point the arresting officer spoke to me			0
' @entity74 would not recount the detail of that brief exchange other than to say that the officer ' expressed how he felt			0
' she does not , she said , want to ' vilify the police			0
' she and the other protesters were driven to a converted garage behind the police station where they were patted down and basic information taken			0
they were then put back in the van and transported to @entity139 's @entity138			0
at no point did anybody read her her rights			0
once there , she recalled , ' you go from nylon handcuffs to metal cuffs when you 're brought in			0
' they take you inside another garage and you stand against a wall			0
you see a nurse then after that they take all of your possessions that are valuable or loose - jewelry and all that mess , shoe laces			0
tensions : @entity62 ( left ) was shot dead in august by officer @entity61 ( right ) in @entity2 , @entity83 , sparking massive protests over the death			1
a grand jury is deciding whether to indict him divide : although most demonstrations have been @entity164 some , such as this woman 's protest , have been in support of @entity61 , the officer who shot @entity62 to death flashpoint : @entity2 is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations tensions : demonstrations are already taking place in @entity2 , @entity83 , with calls for @entity61 to be indicted by the grand jury , which meets again on friday , over the killing of @entity62 ' at that point you 're processed in terms of initial intake			1
then you go through a numbered door and when you get to the other side it 's like what i would call the bus station			0
it 's where you do your time if you 're taken in on a misdemeanor or whatever			0
' the pastor was fingerprinted - a process that she admitted left her feeling ' uneasy ' - and has been charged with ' refusal to disperse and failure to move vehicle which is obstructing flow of traffic '			0
she was lucky , she said			0
she was released at 3am barely four hours after the arrest that so stunned her			1
it is not the first time that @entity74 has had dealings with police in @entity2			0
on october 13 she was detained for nine hours before being released without charge			0
that encounter came during a highly controversial period during which @entity2 police adopted the ' five second rule ' meaning that any protester who stopped walking for more than that time could be arrested			0
the practice was deemed illegal by a federal judge and county chief of police , @entity217 , stripped @entity2 police of their authority over protests			1
yet despite her experiences @entity74 was anxious not to attribute blame			0
she said , ' the clergy want to be compassionate voices to soothe people who are so broken and hurt and to be a voice for the kind of justice that 's actually going to move the polarities to a point where they can heal instead of this place where we 're just shouting and hurting			1
' she intends to go back out along protesters following the @entity60 's announcement because , she said , ' my role is to advocate for justice and to advocate for peace and for change in a system that has for too long needed to change			0
' there is plenty of evidence to suggest that people of color are treated in a discriminatory fashion by our justice system			0
' i think that that is sufficient reason for those of us of conscience to stand with the protesters			0
it 's what @entity258 would do			0
