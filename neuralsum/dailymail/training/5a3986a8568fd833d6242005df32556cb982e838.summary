two guard dogs that protected prince @entity1 as he worked for the @entity2 have been destroyed within days of his final shift			1
@entity4 , a @entity6 shepherd , and @entity7 , a @entity9 shepherd , were put down after the prince left his role as a search and rescue pilot in @entity12			1
the dogs were destroyed on friday after air force bosses decided they could not be redeployed or placed with a family			2
protected : prince @entity1 's two @entity2 guard dogs , @entity6 shepherd @entity4 , pictured right , and @entity9 shepherd blade were destroyed on friday just a few days after he left the service much loved : @entity6 @entity4 , aged seven and a half , had ' come to the end of his work life ' the @entity22 said @entity4 , aged seven and a half , ‘ had come to the end of his work life ’ while @entity7 , nine and a half , could not be reassigned to other duties due to ‘ a record of veterinary and behavioural issues ’			1
the @entity29 finished his last shift at the @entity31 in @entity32 last tuesday			0
it is believed that the two dogs were put down on friday – but last night the @entity22 said the timing was ‘ entirely coincidental ’			1
a spokesman stressed that the prince did not work with the dogs , which were used to provide extra security at the base			2
‘ the department ’s policy is to re-home all military working dogs at the end of their service life wherever practicable , ’ he said			1
‘ regrettably , however , there are occasions when they have to be put down			0
' this action is only ever taken as a last resort			0
unfortunately in this case the dogs were unsuitable for re-homing or alternative duties and so sadly , for the animal ’s welfare , they had to be put down			0
’ an @entity2 source said : ‘ to be clear they were @entity31 security patrol dogs , not sole protection for @entity1			2
the timing of their sad demise is purely coincidental			0
' these dogs had played an invaluable role offering security to our personnel over many years and were much loved by their handlers , who had an extremely strong bond with them			0
‘ sadly these dogs had a record of veterinary and behavioural issues which meant that they could not be reassigned to other duties and they were too aggressive to be kept at home			2
’ a spokesman for the prince declined to comment			0
family first : prince @entity1 left the @entity2 to spend more time with wife @entity80 and their baby son @entity81			1

@entity1 left his role as a search and rescue pilot in @entity12 last week
within days of his last shift , his two guard dogs were destroyed on friday
@entity22 said @entity6 shepherd @entity4 had ' come to the end of his work life ’ while @entity9 shepherd blade could *n't* be reassigned to other duties
