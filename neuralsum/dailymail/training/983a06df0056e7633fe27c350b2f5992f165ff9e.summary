a pensioner has won the battle of @entity3 decorations , by installing a giant inflatable @entity4 on his lawn			1
the 35ft decoration towers above @entity7 , 68 , and 61 - year - old @entity9 's bungalow in the village of @entity11 in @entity12			1
and the waving @entity4 - which cost £ 500 - is kept upright by storm - strength guy ropes , which have been hammered into the ground			1
it can not be tacky enough for me			2
' we just do it for the fun of it really			2
' you can see it from the main road on the other side of the valley			2
' certainly , we think it is the biggest in the region , if not @entity37			2
' it is bigger than the house anyway			2
' the couple , who have nine grandchildren , bought the decoration from a friend who never inflated it because it was too big			1
the huge figure , along with a tiny light - up @entity47 , now stands outside the couple 's home for the festive season			1
mr @entity9 added : ' we have lived here for about 36 years			1
it is a smashing village			0
' the reaction has been very good			0
the £ 500 inflatable is kept upright by storm - strength guy ropes , which have been hammered into the ground ' we go to the local pub often for drinks and the quiz night and get a lot of compliments there			1
' it has just been very fun			0
we have had lots of fun with it			0
' neighbour and amateur photographer @entity69 , 66 , snapped the @entity3 as soon as he noticed it			0
