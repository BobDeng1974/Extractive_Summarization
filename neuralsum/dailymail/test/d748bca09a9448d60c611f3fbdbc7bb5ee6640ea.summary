on friday night i ’ll be wearing @entity2 ’s no 6 shirt for the second time in a @entity4 game			1
the switch from midfield has worked for myself and the team , so i ’m hoping i can carry on playing in the back row for the rest of this season			2
the change of position was a decision my head coach , @entity14 , made after the @entity16 quarter - final against @entity17			1
he phoned me a day after that game to discuss playing me in the back row to maximize my on - field minutes in our run home , to what i call ‘ the big dance ’ : that ’s the finals			1
he thought @entity25 would suit the way we are trying to play as a team and also suit my personal strengths and i agreed			1
@entity30 is set to start at blindside flanker for the second time for @entity2 on friday night @entity2 head coach @entity14 believes @entity30 will make a bigger impact on the game from the backrow @entity30 is still adapting to the 15 - man code with his ball - carrying technique coming under scrutiny in league , for nine years , my game has been about taking short balls and looking for holes			1
at @entity2 , that is what our forwards do , so moving into the pack makes sense and allows me more time on the field , which is what i need to keep improving my union brain			1
we ’ve got , hopefully , five weeks left in the @entity4 and if all goes well i will stay at six , but i do n’t want to be pigeon - holed			1
i ’ve found that has happened a lot since i switched codes			2
whether i ’m playing at 12 , playing at 13 or playing at six , to me , it does n’t make much difference to my attitude			2
i ’ve found only subtle differences between the positions			2
despite enjoying playing at flanker , i have not given up on a centre spot in my future in the game			1
i had a go at six earlier in the season in a couple of @entity69 games , but obviously that is not the same standard			2
now , i feel more comfortable at the breakdown than i did a few months ago and i ’m even getting to grips with the line - out			0
@entity30 began his union career in the centre but is set to finish the season as a back rower i find myself on the ball more , but i was disappointed by a few dropped balls			1
i never seemed to drop the ball as much in league ! we ’re addressing that now — my technique going into contact can improve			0
in union , you can contest for the ball more in the tackle than you can in league , so i ’ve had to adapt a bit			0
i was maybe leading with the ball a bit too much			0
another subtle difference between the codes is that in union players throw spin passes whereas in league , i was used to end - over - end passes			0
now i ’ve played in two positions , it is interesting to compare them			0
when i was in midfield , i thought that being a back was tougher and now i am in the pack , i realise that the forwards are the ones putting in the hard yards , but i ’m sure if i go back into the backline , i ’ll change my mind again ! it was a great experience to spend time with the @entity115 squad			1
@entity30 makes a strong carry during @entity2 's @entity16 clash with @entity118 in december it was fantastic for me to rub shoulders with those players and pick up a few tips			1
i did n’t go in there with any mind - set other than to be myself and enjoy spending time with players i would n’t normally get to sit down and have a brew with			1
training was intense and i enjoyed it			0
you never know when the opportunity will come round again , so i just tried to make the most of it			0
@entity134 ( @entity135 ) wants me to do well in the game and wants me to be around the top players in that environment as much as possible , which is great			1
the former rugby league superstar spent time with @entity142 's @entity115 squad during the @entity143 he just told me to keep doing what i ’ve been doing			0
obviously he has some pretty tough decisions to make , but he was pretty straight - up with me about where i stood			0
he told me i would n’t be part of those @entity143 matches , but he was very happy with how i ’m going			0
i was at the last game against @entity149			2
it was a great day for the sport and showed how freely people can play when the situation allows it			2
the atmosphere was unbelievable and the other players i spoke to said it was probably the best atmosphere they had ever experienced at @entity157			0
@entity30 was recently linked with move back to the @entity159 with @entity160 where his brother @entity161 ( pictured ) plays that ’s why i ’m here ; to be around that sort of atmosphere and to test myself on the best stage			1
it would have been wonderful to be part of that game			2
at around that time there were rumours in @entity172 that @entity160 wanted me back in the @entity159			0
my brother , @entity161 , is there and suddenly my name was being mentioned , but anyone who knows my personality knows that there ’s no way i would go back until i have given it a very good crack in union			0
for now , i ’ll keep giving my best in that @entity184 6 shirt			0
@entity30 is a @entity185 ambassador and face of the since 1904 fashion collection			1
