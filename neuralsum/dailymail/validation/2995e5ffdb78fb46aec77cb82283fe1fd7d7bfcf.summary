@entity0 works as a paintball target , with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range when student @entity0 goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets , fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph			1
the 19 - year - old from @entity10 works as a human bullet impact tester , or more simply a paintball target , and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave			1
he beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the £ 16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies			1
' i guess i have a high pain tolerance - but it 's really not as painful as people think , ' said the @entity31 student			1
' the hardest part is the anticipation when you know it 's coming			0
' the most times i 'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two			0
' and while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing , mr @entity0 does his job in just a t - shirt			1
he is a fan of the game anyway , and has previously played a lot in his spare time			0
he works 16 hours a week at different @entity48 sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of £ 40,000 , which works out at a wage of around £ 16,000 a year			1
mr @entity0 , who stays in shape as a rower , said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job			1
he added : ' when people find out what i do they think i 'm crazy - but i love my job			1
' the initial pain lasts for about five seconds , then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it 's gone			2
i do n't even remember i 've been shot			0
' the teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well - trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to			1
the paintballs are fired at @entity0 's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph			1
rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs , mr @entity0 must stand still while players take aim at him			1
he reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard			1
anything that draws blood , leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable			0
mr @entity0 was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball the 19 - year - old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear the practice leaves him with welts over his body , but the student said he barely notices			1
' sometimes i take a hot bath after a shift , but mostly i just forget they 're even there , ' he added			0
' at first my girlfriend did n't like it , but now she 's cool with it			0
the marks take about four days to fade			0
' i think i got the job because i knew about paintballing already			2
i worked for three years marshalling games - so i was well aware of what it felt like to be hit			2
' i love paintballing and knew about the different types of paints and the ins and outs of the guns			0
' people tell me i must be an idiot but it 's only people who do n't know enough about paintball			2
when you 're in the middle of a game you 're running around and having so much fun you hardly notice when you 're hit			0
the teenager does his job wearing just a t - shirt , and endures balls being fired at him at very close range as part of the role mr @entity0 must stand still and resist the urge , as happens in actual games , to run away ' i work two days a week and my hours are flexible			1
' i have great colleagues and get to work outside and have a bit of fun			0
what 's not to like ? ' @entity141 , @entity48 owner and the student 's boss , said : ' @entity144 's a great guy			1
he 's up for a laugh , has a fantastic attitude and fits in well with the crew - that 's mainly what we were looking for			2
' he can take the bullets like a man and does n't whinge at all			0
he 's athletic and knew about paintball			2
' we still ca n't believe how many applicants we got			0
emails were coming in from all over the world - new ones were popping up faster than we could file them			2
' maybe it 's a sign of the economy , or simply because people love paintball			0
mr @entity164 insists he does n't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range mr @entity0 said he does not mind being hit or the resulting welts and thinks he has a high threshold for pain ' in the end we interviewed 18 guys and @entity0 got the job			1
' we 're very careful and would never put @entity144 at risk			0
' safety is extremely important to us - that 's why we needed a tester in the first place			0
what @entity0 is doing is the extreme			2
it 's done in a controlled environment and we 're testing for worst - case scenario			0
' we 'd never recommend for anyone to emulate it on the playing field or at home			0
' when the job was advertised last year mr @entity141 was quoted as saying : ' we want to hear from people with a high pain threshold and those to whom fear is a foreign concept			1
