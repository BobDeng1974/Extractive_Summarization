by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:48 est , 20 february 2014 a super morbidly obese woman who underwent risky weight loss surgery in a bid to help her regain her life , has failed to lose weight , despite saying her size makes her feel like she 's dead			1
@entity10 , 46 years old , from @entity11 , @entity9 has spent her last 4 years living in her hospital bed			1
weighing in at 530lb or 37 stone , @entity10 ’s size confines her to her bed totally forcing her to rely on her husband for even basic needs , and meaning her ability to mother her young son is severely restricted			1
i let food be the way which i found solace			0
‘ sometimes it feels like i ’m dead			0
i can not do the things that other people take for granted			0
my bed is my bathroom , my dinner table , my world			2
i might as well be a prisoner in jail			0
food addiction has become my life			0
’ despite this , @entity10 refused to follow the diet after a risky gastric bypass surgery , meaning she remains super morbidly obese			1
after marrying her husband , @entity44 , @entity10 had four miscarriages before giving birth to her first son , @entity47			1
@entity10 's ability to care for her son @entity47 is restricted by her size			1
she has to experience much of his life through pictures or videos sent to her in her bed shortly after @entity47 was born , @entity10 ’s weight forced her to become bed ridden , making @entity44 the primary care - giver for her and her son			1
‘ even as early as third grade i knew i was heavier , and i remember in fourth grade i started having to wear plus sizes and i hated that			0
' i just gained about 20lb a year , i ended up being close to 300lb by the time i was 22 or so			0
' my weight is very near 600 at this time			0
my world has closed in around me			0
’ @entity10 experiences @entity47 ’s life through technology , seeing him arrive for his first day at school through pictures sent on her @entity72 and participating in family dinners through @entity74 as she sits on her bed , eating			1
though @entity10 does help take care of @entity47 , her care is confined to what can be done with her remaining in her bed			1
@entity10 is transported inside her own home carried on a blanket			2
her and her family traveled to @entity82 , @entity82 so she could receive risky weight loss surgery ‘ if he refused to come into my bubble then i would n’t be able to help him , ’ she says			1
@entity44 , who bathes and cooks for @entity10 as well as helping her in going to the loo without leaving the bed , says : ‘ her weight has affect us in many ways			1
i have to go to all the school functions			0
@entity47 does tai kwon do and she has never actually seen him , i ’ve had to video him			0
' growing up with an abusive father , @entity10 continued to gain weight and found that her body was a defense tool that she could use to protect herself and her two sisters			1
her weight continued to climb and as a young adult , @entity10 found herself to be over 400 - lbs and admitted to having a food addiction			1
her sisters @entity106 and @entity107 say they believe @entity10 ’s distorted relationship with food began in childhood , when they witnessed their mother being physically abused by their father			2
it takes an entire of people , including the local fire department , to help get @entity10 off her bed and out of her house ‘ @entity10 was the oldest and she probably experienced a lot more of it than we did , ’ @entity106 says			1
‘ she had to bear the brunt of a lot of what we have to go through			0
it ’s not always her fault ; the eating now is but a lot of the stuff in our history … she had nobody to tell her yea it ’s going to be ok			0
’ when @entity44 and @entity10 became a couple she was around 420lb and , although large , was able to lead a normal life			2
while pregnant with their son @entity47 her weight ballooned to 620lb and after giving birth she struggled to lose the pounds			1
@entity10 ’s size means the couple have n’t been able to share a bed for years and @entity44 became her full time carer , forcing the family to live off disability benefits			1
her weight also left her with numerous health problems including diabetes and , desperate to receive the weight loss surgery she believed she needed to save her life , @entity10 was forced to travel to @entity82 to find a doctor who specialises in patients at her weight			1
@entity10 traveled on a hospital mattress in the back of a van and the local fire department had to help manoeuvre her out of the house			2
bypass surgeon dr @entity158 discovers @entity10 's @entity159 is 85.7 when she is admitted to the specialist hospital in @entity82 @entity44 and @entity10 travelled across the country to see bypass surgeon dr @entity158			2
‘ a normal @entity159 is under 25 , over 40 is classed as super morbidly obese			0
@entity10 ’s @entity159 is 85.7 , that is very big , ’ explains dr @entity158			2
‘ @entity10 has a lot of issues ; some of them are real and some are imaginary			2
it seems like she has played the role of being a victim and encouraging family to be enablers			0
this dynamic is very difficult to break			0
’ @entity10 spent a month in hospital under supervision on a strict diet and lost 40lb before undergoing surgery to dramatically reduce the size of her stomach in an attempt to help her eat less			1
@entity10 , pictured here with husband @entity44 ( left ) insists she can not walk and is trying hard with her diet , despite gaining weight after the gastric bypass however following the surgery @entity10 struggled to readjust her attitude to food , and in particular to get out of bed and start walking – a crucial component of continuing her weight loss			1
despite being on a 1,200 calorie a day diet , @entity10 failed to lose any more weight , leading dr @entity158 to conclude she must have convinced someone to sneak additional food in for her			1
three months after the surgery @entity10 is sent home by the hospital due to her failure to comply with treatment , but she insisted that this was ultimately a good thing			1
‘ i am going to lose the weight for sure , i just need to be at home with my family , ' she says			2
the family rented an apartment near the hospital to allow @entity10 to continue receiving treatment at the hospital			2
once at home @entity10 is provided with a physical therapist to try and help her walk but she continued to resist and , despite being given detailed instructions on her strict diet plan , returns to her old unhealthy eating habits ,			2
even when a nutritionist visits the home to attempt to help the family improve their diet , @entity10 remains resistant			2
@entity10 spent a month in hospital under supervision on a strict diet and lost 40lb before undergoing surgery to dramatically reduce the size of her stomach ‘ you have no manner of people telling you what you can and ca n’t do but ultimately the only person who knows what ’s best for you is you , ’ she justifies			1
‘ i ’m just not able to walk or stand , i know my limitations			0
the thing is there just was n’t a diet given to me			0
there ’s only so many popsicles and soups and cream of wheat ’s you can eat before you are done with it			0
‘ i can not function without wantons ( a type of deep fried dough with filling )			0
they ’re probably not the best thing for me , but i could eat all of this ( indicating a platter of wantons ) and it would n’t be as detrimental to me as not eating			0
' when she is readmitted to hospital five months after surgery , @entity10 has regained five of the initial 40lb she lost in hospital before surgery			2
after the surgery @entity10 's weight loss stalls and dr @entity158 suspects she is having extra food brought into the hospital for her ‘ i think @entity10 is convincing herself			1
she is her own worst enemy and her husband is her second worst enemy and they do n’t realise this is a dangerous game she ’s playing , ’ say dr @entity158			0
despite renewing her attempts to lose weight back at home , @entity10 fails to achieve her goal of being able to walk , and so attend her son @entity47 ’s graduation			1
over nine months on from the surgery that drastically reduced the size of her stomach she has not lost weight and remains bed bound			1
over nine months on from the surgery that drastically reduced the size of her stomach she has not lost weight and remains bed bound ‘ @entity10 lives in a false reality where she chooses to over eat but wo n’t admit it			1
she has to decide she wants to lose weight and that she wants to walk			1
but i do n’t see any willingness to want to get well , ’ dr @entity158			0
eventually @entity10 decided to leave @entity82 , terminating her treatment at the hospital , and returns home to @entity285 where she feels she feels she will be able to lose weight			1
‘ even if i ’m not successful in the world ’s eyes , the fact that i did all of this so far changed my path in life forever			0
' i do n’t ever have to be an ideal weight in @entity47 ’s eyes because he has seen what i ’m willing to do for him , and he ’s proud of me			0
’ dr @entity158 adds : ' at this point i do n’t think @entity10 has any intention to change anything in her lifestyle			2
‘ i do n’t know what will work for @entity10			0
i hope that she wakes up at one point otherwise i do n’t think she is going to live too long			0
