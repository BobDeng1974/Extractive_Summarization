as a policeman in the @entity3 city of @entity4 , @entity0 is well used to stopping traffic			1
but he caused a hold - up of a different kind recently while on duty for the city 's marathon			0
the race 's female runners thought that he was so good looking that they abandoned their race and surrounded him , battling for the chance to take a selfie with him			0
no escape : @entity0 is surrounded in his car by admirers - forcing him to call for ( presumably less handsome ) back - up stopped in their tracks : female runners take a break from the race to have a snap taken with the officer , who many said looked like the film star @entity29 the 29 - year - old was mobbed at the race in south - western @entity3 partly because many of the admirers thought he looked like a leading @entity3 film star , according to the @entity35			1
hundreds of admirers posted pictures online , with many pointing out his resemblance to actor @entity29			1
@entity40 , 25 , said : ' i thought he looked just like the actor from @entity43 , @entity29 , the guy who is in the news at the moment because of his latest role as a tv cop			2
' the crowds became so big , the policeman was surrounded in his car as he tried to leave the sporting event			0
@entity53 , 26 , who posted a photo , said the furore distracted people from the race			0
doppelganger : many thought the officer looked like @entity3 film star @entity29 ( pictured ) mobbed : huge crowds gather as women - and men - rush to take his picture at the marathon in @entity3 film star ? @entity0 drew comparisons to popular actor @entity29 ( right ) with some even suggesting the officer was really the actor on a secret shoot already taken : unfortunately for the women of @entity4 , officer @entity0 has recently got married she said : ' i remember reading that some @entity75 runner was the winner but you did n't see him in the newspaper coverage , everybody was just going on about this policeman			1

' race organisers in the @entity4 confirmed it had caused congestion with many runners wanting their picture taken alongside him			2

arresting : @entity92 runners and supporters flock to take pictures of the handsome officer in south - western @entity3 fellow police officer @entity96 said : ' he only just got back on duty after getting married , so i do n't think his new wife will be too impressed			1
' anyway , it was getting a bit out of hand so he was taken off duty and replaced by another less good - looking colleague			0
