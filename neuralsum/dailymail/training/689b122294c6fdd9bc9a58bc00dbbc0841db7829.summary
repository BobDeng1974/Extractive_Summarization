by @entity0 last updated at 3:22 pm on 12th december 2011 @entity2 experts are planning to ' reverse engineer ' the @entity5 drone captured by its armed forces in a bid to recover data and mass - produce a superior version of the aircraft			1
@entity12 has been flaunting the capture of the downed @entity5 drone which ' violated @entity2 airspace ' , with experts saying the drone could now be reproduced through reverse engineering			1
gen @entity19 , deputy head of @entity2 's elite @entity20 , said on state television that the violation of @entity2 's airspace by the @entity5 drone was a ' hostile act ' and warned of a ' bigger ' response			1
keeping it : @entity2 says it will not return the @entity5 @entity28 high - altitude reconnaissance drone that crashed in @entity2 earlier this month officials in @entity2 even believe they can ' mass produce ' the captured bat - winged stealthy @entity28 and build a ' superior ' version following its crash on december 4			1
@entity33 , the head of @entity2 's parliamentary national security committee , said today : ' our next action will be to reverse - engineer the aircraft			2
' in the near future , we will be able to mass produce it ... @entity2 engineers will soon build an aircraft superior to the @entity5 [ drone ] using reverse engineering			1
' @entity2 officials say a @entity20 cyber-warfare unit hacked the aircraft 's flight controls			1
@entity33 said @entity2 experts were in the ' final stages of cracking ( the drone 's ) code '			1
graphic : the @entity28 was reportedly used to watch former @entity55 leader @entity54 during the @entity57 mission that killed him he also denied accusations from the @entity5 that @entity2 did n't have the technology to replicate the drone , and that it would only be able to do so with @entity61 of @entity63 help			1

gen @entity19 called its capture a victory for @entity2 and a defeat for the @entity5 in a complicated intelligence and technological battle			2
' @entity2 is among the few countries that possesses the most modern technology in the field of pilotless drones			2
the technology gap between @entity2 and the @entity5 is not much , ' he said			2
worries : @entity5 officials are concerned about the @entity2 potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to @entity63 or @entity61 military officials : these images give more credence to @entity2 's claims of having the highly - sensitive drone broke down : @entity5 officials say @entity2 had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth			1
they contend it simply malfunctioned officers in the guard , @entity2 's most powerful military force , had previously claimed that the country 's armed forces brought down the surveillance aircraft with an electronic ambush , causing minimum damage to the drone			1

we ca n't elaborate on the methods we employed to intercept , control , discover and bring down the pilotless plane , ' he said			0
