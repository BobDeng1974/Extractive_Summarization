it has become as much of a festive staple as turkey and tinsel – but now @entity4 ? is getting a very modern update			0
three decades since their charity single first topped the charts , @entity6 and @entity7 relaunched @entity11 yesterday			1
and while time may have taken its toll on both of them , they proved they have lost none of their youthful passion as they vowed to raise millions for victims of the ebola crisis in @entity22			1
the pair are enlisting the help of a string of youthful acts – sprinkled with a few veteran singers – to record a new version of the song which raised £ 8million for famine victims in @entity31 in 1984			2
@entity7 , 61 , jokingly conceded : ‘ we are old			0
there is no doubt about it			0
one of us has too much of a hair quota			0
’ already expected to go to no 1 , the track will be recorded on saturday and will be available to download from monday for 99p			2
a physical copy of the single , with artwork by @entity61 , will follow , costing £ 4			1
but in a sign of the changing times , sir @entity6 said the @entity64 will not be available for another three weeks because many of the factories that produce them have closed			1
it is the fourth time the song has been recorded , but the stars are enlisting a roster of new talent , many of whom are too young to remember the first @entity11			1

sir @entity6 said that the lyrics of the track had to be updated because the new appeal is not designed to combat hunger			1
however , he said that as in the @entity31 famine , the root cause of the ebola crisis is poverty , adding : ‘ that is radically unacceptable			0
’ he conceded raising money would be harder because some will try to listen to the track for free on the internet			2
but he said : ‘ it really does n’t matter if you hate the artists			0
it really does n’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording			0
what you have to do is buy this thing			0
’ @entity115 will also perform on the track which will raise money to fight the deadly ebola virus in west africa hoping for success : @entity120 will be hoping to surpass the original version , a response to the famine which was causing a huge death toll in @entity31 , which was released in 1984 and sold 3.7million copies have faith : paloma faith will join the likes of @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity80 on the charity single @entity50 singer @entity132 will perform on the single , which will be recorded on saturday 30 years ago : @entity42 ( left ) , @entity135 ( centre ) and @entity137 from @entity138 ( right ) took part in live aid concerts in 1985 - a year after the first @entity11 from left are @entity129 of @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity42 , @entity137 of @entity138 , @entity145 of @entity143 ! and @entity146 , who performed at the @entity148 concert band aid was first put together in 1984 when @entity150 frontman @entity6 and singer - songwriter @entity7 brought the greatest bands of the time together to record a charity single			1
@entity6 had been so moved by the famine in @entity31 that he decided to ring around contacts he had made in the music industry			0
artists including the likes of @entity42 , @entity158 , @entity135 , @entity138 , @entity159 and @entity129 met at a studio in @entity161 , @entity162 , where they were given 24 hours to produce the record			2
