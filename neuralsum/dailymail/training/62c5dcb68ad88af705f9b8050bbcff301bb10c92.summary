i ’d write up the opposition team on a flip chart			2
then i ’d write up the @entity4 team			1
then i ’d eyeball my players			2
‘ ok , what dressing room do you want to be in ? what team sheet would you rather be on ? ’ it was the @entity4 rugby dressing room , but it could also be the @entity4 football dressing room with @entity11 addressing his players before this opening @entity15 fixture against @entity16			1
‘ you want to be in our dressing room , with @entity19 , with @entity20 , with @entity21 as your team - mates , or would you rather be on their team sheet ? ’ make no mistake , this is a very good @entity27 team who qualified with two games to spare , but @entity4 have nothing to fear			1
play to win : skipper @entity19 shows the way @entity4 should do it against @entity33 in qualifying fighting spirit : @entity21 is a matchwinner and his talents in front of goal should be utilised @entity11 has to convey that to his players in the moments when an international coach takes to his stage			1
the closer to kick - off , the more important his role becomes			2
what is his body language in the build - up ? the players will be watching him			1
is he nervous or confident ? does he believe in his team ? do not create any reason for doubt			2
international management is so different to club management			0
this is the group stages but you must treat it as if it is knockout football and @entity11 is one - on - one against @entity61 , the former @entity62 and @entity63 coach who is now manager of @entity16			1
my team had a saying : ‘ there is no monday morning if you lose			0
’ by that we meant there was a finality about defeat			0
@entity74 ended , and there would be no monday morning meeting			0
that is what @entity11 should be telling his players			1
win this game and @entity4 are in control of their group			1
even a 0 - 0 result against @entity16 would represent failure , a failure to win and a missed opportunity			2
i hope @entity11 will be telling them : ‘ you play for @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ... but this is @entity4			1
some of you may have won titles and @entity99 medals , but that was playing for your club			0
this is the @entity15 , this is the whole country			0
this is @entity4 v @entity16 and this is the biggest game you have ever played in your lives			2
so let ’s prepare and play as if our lives depend on it , let ’s really make things happen , go and win it			2
’ rallying cry : sir @entity113 has urged @entity11 to go out and attack @entity16 the waiting is almost over : @entity4 meet @entity16 in @entity115 in a must - not - lose opener i would n’t be playing down this game , i ’d be turning it up			1
@entity11 should be creating pressure in the team because the greatest athletes love pressure — that is why they do it			1
the bigger the reward , the greater the fear			0
the fear of failure is what drives on elite athletes			2
in @entity131 , they do not aim for the podium			0
in my @entity4 rugby team , i only wanted players who were there to win the @entity15 and who would thrive on the fear of failure			1
it is a big error for an international coach , dealing with elite players , to play down these moments			2
do the opposite of what everyone — including your opponents — will expect			0
it is a fine line and there should not be any illusions			0
in my dressing room we did n’t have players headbutting the wall or screaming out the national anthem			0
this might disappoint people outside the dressing room but the reality is far more impressive			0
before playing @entity163 in the group stages of the 2003 @entity15 , a huge crunch game for us , i recall total focus in the dressing room			0
this game had been in the back of everyone ’s mind for months , just like @entity4 v @entity16 , but there was total understanding and control over the emotion and the magnitude of the task at hand — and the players thrived on it			1
yes , you need your players to keep their discipline and to make the right decisions under pressure , such as not diving into a tackle			2
but you can also remind your team that the opposition are under pressure , too , and challenge them to create even more pressure			1
putting his body on the line : @entity195 makes the crucial charge down on @entity197 which led to @entity4 's only try in the 25 - 6 win over @entity163 fully focused : @entity199 beams after scoring that crucial try which ensured @entity4 topped @entity201 there are many ways you create pressure but the most effective and easiest is to do everything — and i mean everything — faster than they are used to			1
can you make them feel uncomfortable ? target their weak areas			0
we saw the @entity215 ’s @entity214 worry the @entity27 defence with his pace and movement in the recent friendly at @entity220 and we should look for more of the same			2
yes , your team will be tested , but test them			0
one of my favourite expressions in sport is ‘ pressure with @entity228 ’			0
no doubt @entity16 will put us under pressure at times , with the amount of possession they are likely to have and @entity237 ’s ability to pick out a killer pass — but how do we respond when we win the ball back ? turnover is something that we talk about a lot in rugby but it is equally important in football			1
the reason why football is the world ’s no 1 game is because it is simple			0
do n’t overcomplicate the tactics , even if there is a temptation to show how clever you are			0
it is the @entity15 and we want to look and play smart			0
but a smart coach is a winning coach			0
get your basics absolutely right — which for me in football are the set - pieces — and go from there			2
@entity4 are in good shape			1
they deserve a ‘ well done ’ for keeping the focus on the football			1
all anyone is talking about is the line - up and who should play			2
there is no distraction from the @entity271 , no off - field scandals to be ashamed of			0
they can focus on the challenge ahead			0
@entity11 should take great credit for that , as it is not easy			2
mercurial talent : @entity16 boss @entity61 ( left ) jokes with @entity278 ( centre ) and @entity237 in training @entity282 opponents : @entity4 must beware @entity284 top scorer @entity283 ( left ) and the gnarled @entity285 now , going into a game of this nature , i would pick a team as if my life depended on it			1
not a team to come close to victory but a team that would attack for victory			0
just naming this team will set the tone of how @entity4 will play			1
i would look at my rugby team and ask : ‘ do we have the players to score five tries ? ’ @entity11 should be asking : ‘ do we have the players to score three goals ? ’ if @entity4 score three , @entity16 will have to be very good not to lose			1
with that in mind , i would play @entity305 and @entity306 , both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards , ask questions and force mistakes from opponents with their pace and their ability to run at players			1
that would increase the pressure on @entity16 ’s players			2
i used to have to name my rugby team on a thursday , two days before the game			0
but every team i named , i wanted to wake on the day of the game thinking , ‘ wow ... i ’m excited to watch this team ’			0
i hope @entity11 arrives at the stadium in @entity115 genuinely excited about how this team are going to attack			1
i ’ve met him a few times and he is great company and someone i can see the players will totally trust			0
he is experienced and this challenge will not daunt him			0
precocious talent : @entity305 ( right ) should be given the nod to frighten @entity16 in @entity4 's opener @entity332 of foot : the pace of @entity306 ( right ) can give any defence serious problems a meeting of minds : sir @entity113 chats with @entity11 on @entity341 's @entity340 before the @entity15 i hope he reads this			1
i hope he banishes any thought of ‘ a draw will do ’			1
take risks , create the mindset : ‘ we must win ’			1
pick a team to score goals			1
erase any negative thoughts about the heat and the jungle conditions and playing slowly			0
let ’s surprise @entity16 , give them the unexpected , win the game before the opponents realise they are in a game			0
international football can be slow , so make it fast			0
@entity91 climbed from seventh place to second by stunning opponents and winning games early			0
they have top players , so do @entity4			1
@entity4 must keep the ball and hurt the opposition , but above everything play with great pace and energy			1
two questions for @entity11 with the same answer : has he got the team ? yes			1
can @entity4 win this ? yes			1
there is no monday morning .			0

this is a very good @entity27 team who qualified with two games to spare , but @entity4 have nothing to fear
@entity11 should be creating pressure in the team because the greatest athletes love pressure - that is why they do it
there are many ways you create pressure but the most effective and easiest is to do everything - and i mean everything - faster than they are used to
@entity4 are in good shape . they deserve a ' well done ' for keeping the focus on the football
i would play @entity305 and @entity306 , both brilliant attacking players who take the ball forwards
i hope he banishes any thought of ' a draw will do ' . take risks , create the mindset : ' we must win ' . pick a team to score goals
