scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain , which could go some way to warding off the disease			1
the @entity18 academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to @entity22 ’s patients , but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘ promising ’ findings as providing ‘ vital new clues ’ about the disease			1
plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of @entity22 ’s , so anything that can stop their build - up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition			1
the research , published in the journal @entity38 , found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent			1
the experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50 , but the scientists , from the universities of @entity47 and @entity48 , hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients			1
the drug , marketed in the @entity52 as @entity53 , also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice , halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent			1
lead scientist dr @entity60 , from @entity61 said : ‘ antidepressants appear to be significantly reducing amyloid beta production , and that ’s exciting			1
' but while antidepressants generally are well tolerated , they have risks and side effects			0
‘ until we can more definitively prove that these drugs help slow or stop @entity22 ’s in humans , the risks are n’t worth it			0
there is still much more work to do			0
’ the amyloid beta protein is a waste product of normal brain activity			2
but its levels rise in the brains of @entity22 ’s patients , causing it to clump together in plaques			1
earlier research by dr @entity60 ’s team showed that serotonin , a brain messenger chemical , reduces amyloid beta production			2
serotonin is also linked to mood , and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain serotonin is also linked to mood , and many antidepressants work by keeping the neurotransmitter circulating in the brain			2
the scientists are now investigating how serotonin affects amyloid beta production in mice at the molecular level			2
co-author dr @entity101 , from the @entity102 , said : ‘ we also plan to study older adults who will be treated for two weeks with antidepressants			2
‘ if we see a drop in levels of amyloid beta in their spinal fluid after two weeks , then we will know that this beneficial reduction in amyloid beta is sustainable			0
’ dr @entity111 , head of research at @entity113 , said : ‘ amyloid build - up occurs many years before symptoms appear in @entity22 ’s , and understanding how to prevent or delay its accumulation early is a key goal for @entity22 ’s researchers			2
‘ this study has yielded some interesting findings , and further research to understand the mechanisms responsible for these results could provide vital new clues about the disease and how to fight it			0
‘ currently half a million people in the @entity52 are living with @entity22 ’s , the most common cause of dementia , and we urgently need treatments that can stop the disease in its tracks			0
' investment in research is crucial if we are to develop these treatments and provide better outcomes for people with the disease			0
’ dr @entity139 , director of research at the @entity141 , added : ‘ the fact that this anti-depressant has the ability to reduce the production of amyloid beta is promising , and it is encouraging to see the effects in mice replicated in people			0
‘ however , this was a small study in healthy people , so more research is needed to see if the drug could work for people with dementia , or even help prevent the condition developing in the first place			1
’ @entity53 is one of the most - commonly prescribed antidepressants in @entity160 , where 53million prescriptions of all antidepressants are issued a year , double the number prescribed a decade ago			0
according to recent research , one in three @entity52 women and one in 10 men now take antidepressants , and doctors have been warned not to routinely prescribe the drugs			0
while citalopram is not clinically addictive , some experts fear that people who take it as an antidepressant can become dependent on it .			0
