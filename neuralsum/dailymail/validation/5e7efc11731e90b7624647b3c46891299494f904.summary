@entity0 has raised the spectre of the heysel disaster and warned of a growing issue of hooligans and political fanatics taking control in football stadiums in @entity8			1
the @entity8 president , who was on the pitch for @entity11 at the @entity13 final in @entity14 30 years ago when 39 people - mainly from the @entity17 club - died after rioting @entity19 fans charged @entity11 supporters causing a wall to collapse			1
@entity0 has called for tougher stadium bans and a @entity24 - wide sports police force			1
speaking at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity0 said : ' @entity8 is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time			2
@entity0 wants to see a @entity24 sports police force introduced to prevent football hooliganism ' this insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums , as football is a reflection of society			1
given its popularity , our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent			0
and that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments			0
' i therefore renew my call for greater awareness of this issue among the public authorities , so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not - so - distant past - a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain @entity24 stadiums			2
' in recent months , we have all been struck by certain images that i thought were a thing of the past			0
some of us experienced that past at first hand			0
in my case , it was exactly 30 years ago ... nobody wants a repeat of such events			0
the heysel disaster took place in 1985 during @entity68 between @entity11 and @entity19 39 fans were killed when they were crushed to death when @entity19 fans breached the neutral area most of the fatalities were @entity11 fans and @entity0 wants to avoid any future incidents like this ' we need tougher stadium bans at @entity24 level and - i will say it again - the creation of a @entity24 sports police force			1
' @entity0 also appeared to have a veiled dig at @entity85 for deciding to run for a fifth term as @entity88 president despite having said at the @entity25 four years ago that his fourth term would be his last			1
@entity85 then described himself as the ' captain of the ship in troubled waters bringing in back on the right route '			2
the @entity17 , who is himself being re-elected unopposed for a third term , told @entity8 delegates : ' i regard myself as a simple team - mate - at most your captain			2
but not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm			0
' @entity104 fans clash with riot police during mass fighting in the @entity107 in the @entity108 @entity110 's players were forced to step in and try to calm their fans down which forced the match to be halted sept @entity85 is preparing to run for a fifth term despite saying that his current one would be his last @entity0 's printed speech included the words ' clinging to the helm for dear life ' but he dropped that line when he delivered the speech , saying only : ' no. i am simply the captain of a winning team - one that wins because it boasts 54 talented presidents and general secretaries who are prepared to play for each other			1
' in his speech to the @entity25 on tuesday , @entity85 made no reference to standing again for @entity88 president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 @entity134 in @entity135 due to its involvement in the civil war in @entity138			1
@entity85 said : ' @entity139 shall be united , sport shall be united when it comes to boycotts because boycott has never given any results			2
we have to pay attention to political interference 's			0
the autonomy of sport must be guaranteed			0
' @entity0 has experienced first hand football hooliganism when he was on the pitch for the heysel disaster			0

@entity0 wants to create a ' @entity24 sports police force ' in the future
in the light of recent crowd trouble the @entity8 president wants to avoid a repeat of the ' @entity151 ' while he was playing for @entity11
@entity0 also seemed to a have a dig at @entity88 president sept @entity85
