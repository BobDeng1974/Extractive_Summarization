light skin in @entity1 stems from a gene mutation from a single person who lived 10,000 years ago			1
this is according to a new @entity6 study that claims the colour is due to an ancient ancestor who lived somewhere between the @entity9 and the @entity11 subcontinent			2
scientists made the discovery after identifying a key gene that contributes to lighter skin colour in @entity1			0
light skin in @entity1 stems from a gene mutation from a single person who lived 10,000 years ago , according to research at @entity19 in earlier research , @entity20 from @entity21 reported that one amino acid difference in the gene @entity25 is a key contributor to the skin colour difference between @entity1 and @entity28			2
‘ the mutation in @entity25 changes just one building block in the protein , and contributes about a third of the visually striking differences in skin tone between peoples of @entity37 and @entity1 ancestry , ’ he said			2
he added the lighter skin colour may have provided an advantage due to the better creation of vitamin d from sunlight in the dark northern latitudes			0
building on this research , professor @entity44 worked with professor @entity20 to study @entity47 sequence differences across the globe			1
the mutation in gene @entity25 changes just one building block in the protein , and contributes about a third of the visually striking differences in skin tone between peoples of @entity37 and @entity1 ancestry they studied segments of genetic code that have a mutation and are located closely on the same chromosome and are often inherited together			1
the a mutation , called @entity61 , is found in virtually every one of @entity1 ancestry			1
@entity62 is also found in populations in the @entity9 and @entity11 subcontinent , but not in high numbers in @entity66			2
@entity21 's @entity20 identified a key gene that contributes to lighter skin colour in @entity1 and differs from @entity66 they discovered that all individuals from the @entity9 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 who carry the @entity61 mutation share traces of the ancestral genetic code			1
according to the researchers , this indicates that all existing instances of this mutation originate from the same person			1
the pattern of people with this lighter skin colour mutation suggests that the @entity61 mutation occurred somewhere between the @entity9 and the @entity11 subcontinent			1
‘ this means that @entity9 and @entity74 , which includes most inhabitants of @entity74 , @entity88 and @entity89 , share significant ancestry , ’ professor @entity20 said			0
this mutated segment of @entity47 was itself created from a combination of two other mutated segments commonly found in @entity94 - traditionally defined as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
‘ the coincidence of this interesting form of evidence of shared ancestry of @entity102 with @entity1 , within this tiny chromosomal region , is exciting , ’ said professor @entity20			1
‘ the combining of segments occurred after the ancestors of @entity102 and @entity1 split geographically more than 50,000 years ago ; the @entity61 mutation occurred afterward			1
’ professor @entity20 now plans to look at more genetic samples to better understand what genes play the most important role in @entity111 skin colour			2
newly released genomes from around a dozen early inhabitants of @entity1 suggest that the continent was once a melting pot in which brown - eyed farmers encountered blue - eyed hunter - gatherers			0
a report in @entity119 claims that present - day @entity1 have ancestry from three groups in various combinations : these three groups were identified from the genomes of 8,000 - year - old hunter - gatherers - one man from @entity127 and seven individuals from @entity129 - as well as the genome of a 7,500 - year - old woman from @entity132			0
the study was led by the @entity134 in @entity132			2
the research suggests that the individuals from @entity127 and @entity137 probably had dark - skin and blue eyes			0
the @entity132 woman , meanwhile , had brown eyes and lighter skin , and was related to @entity9 groups			0
both the @entity127 hunter - gatherer and the @entity132 farmer had a gene that breaks down saliva - and a feature that may have came about due to agricultural life			0
however , neither of them had the ability to digest the sugar lactose , found in milk			0
the trait originally emerged in the @entity9 after the domestication of cattle and later spread to @entity1			0
previous studies suggested that @entity1 today largely descended from @entity9 farmers .			0

study *focused* on *dna* differences across globe with the @entity61 mutation
those who had mutation also shared traces of an ancestral genetic code
this indicates that all instances of mutation originate from same person
the mutated segment of @entity47 was itself created from a combination of two other mutations commonly found in @entity102
