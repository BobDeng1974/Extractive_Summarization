by @entity0 @entity1 has agreed to settle with the @entity2 over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service			1
the hit app came under fire after it failed to tell users that others could save their messages without their knowledge , and collected users ' contacts without telling them or asking permission			1
the firm today agreed to settle without admitting or denying any wrongdoing and claimed it has already addressed many of the issues the @entity2 raised			1
@entity1 has agreed to settle with the @entity2 over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages they send through its service and collected users contacts without telling them or asking for permission			1
back in february @entity35 bought hugely popular messaging app @entity36 for $ 19 billion ( £ 11.4 billion ) , after failing in a previous $ 3 billion to buy @entity1			1
at the start of april , @entity38 revealed its ‘ @entity44 ’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other			1
this directly followed once - popular social network @entity47 ’s attempts to get back into the game with @entity49 , their own video messaging service			1
@entity35 , meanwhile , is busy trying to increase the profile of its @entity53 app , with rumours that it will shift @entity36 users onto its native messaging client			2
they recently announced a selfie feature for messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself			0
and even @entity64 is getting in on the game – it ’s rumoured they are considering letting users have secret conversations on the site			0
as part of the settlement , @entity1 must implement a privacy program that will be monitored by an outside privacy expert for the next 20 years			1
the arrangement is similar to privacy settlements that @entity75 , @entity35 and @entity76 have agreed to in recent years			1
' if a company markets privacy and security as key selling points in pitching its service to consumers , it is critical that it keep those promises , ' @entity77 , the chairwoman for the @entity2 , said in a statement			1
' any company that makes misrepresentations to consumers about its privacy and security practices risks @entity2 action			0
' although @entity1 said its app notified users when a recipient takes a screenshot of a ' snap ' they 've sent , the @entity2 said recipients with an @entity101 device that runs an operating system that predates @entity103 could evade the app 's screenshot detection			1
@entity101 's @entity103 launched last summer			0
in addition , the @entity2 said @entity1 's app stored video snaps that were not encrypted on the recipient 's device			1
the videos remained accessible to the recipient , the agency said			0
a user could access a video message , even after it supposedly disappeared , if the user simply connected the phone to a computer and accessed the video in the device 's file directory			0
the @entity2 complaint also alleges that @entity1 failed to secure its ' find friends ' feature			1
a security breach in january allowed hackers to collect the usernames and phone numbers of some 4.6 million snapchat users			1
to use @entity1 's new chat feature ( pictured ) you simply need to swipe right on one of your friend 's names in the app 's inbox			1
messages are deleted when you both quit the chat window you can activate the front ( left ) and rear ( right ) cameras on your device by dragging your finger to the bottom and top of your phone respectively the breach occurred after security experts warned the company at least twice about a vulnerability in its system			0
snapchat later issued an update to its app that fixed the issue and allowed users to opt out of the ' find friends ' feature			1
@entity1 's @entity159 app also transmitted users ' location information , the @entity2 said , even though the company told users it did n't collect such information			1
the settlement does n't have a financial component , but if @entity1 is found to violate the agreement , the company could end up paying a civil penalty of up to $ 16,000 for each violation			2
the @entity26 startup reportedly turned down a $ 3 billion buyout offer from @entity35 last fall			0
in a blog post thursday , @entity1 said that when its app was being created , ' some things did n't get the attention they could have			2
' ' when we started building @entity1 , we were focused on developing a unique , fast , and fun way to communicate with photos			2
' we learned a lot during those early days			0
' one of the ways we learned was by making mistakes , acknowledging them , and fixing them			0
' while we were focused on building , some things did n’t get the attention they could have			0
' one of those was being more precise with how we communicated with the @entity1 community			2
' this morning we entered into a consent decree with the @entity2 that addresses concerns raised by the commission			0
' we are devoted to promoting user privacy and giving @entity193 control over how and with whom they communicate			0
' ' one of those was being more precise with how we communicated with the @entity1 community , ' the company said in the post			2
@entity1 , however , said it has since fixed the problems			2
' even before today 's consent decree was announced , we had resolved most of those concerns over the past year by improving the wording of our privacy policy , app description , and in - app just - in - time notifications , ' the company said			2
' and we continue to invest heavily in security and countermeasures to prevent abuse			0
' the settlement will be formally approved in 30 days once a public comment period ends			0
the company is based in @entity26 and is run by @entity25 and @entity215 , two former fraternity brothers at @entity217			0
the service was first released in 2011 and quickly gained a following among high school students in @entity221			0
the company does not reveal the number of people currently using its service , but says more than 700 million messages are sent each day .			0
