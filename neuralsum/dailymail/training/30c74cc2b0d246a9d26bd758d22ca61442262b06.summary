by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 13:33 est , 13 march 2014 perched on the edge of a sofa , drink in one hand and a canape in the other , i tried to make conversation with my blind date			1
as party - goers cavorted around us , i asked the nice man in the dinner suit about his job , then told him about my horses , before throwing in a couple of political firelighters to see if i could spark a good conversation into life			2
but we just did n't seem to be getting anywhere			2
eventually , we gave up talking and sat staring into space as our friends grew merry on champagne and danced around the living room			1
speaking out for the single ladies : @entity0 , left , is glad @entity26 defended a woman 's right to remain single and childless the ' date ' was the result of a well - meaning friend insisting that i should not be alone as i saw in the @entity32			1
' no , no , i 've found you a man , ' she said , uttering the most terrifying words in the @entity38 language			2
she reminded me a friend of ours had a son who was recently separated and so would accompany me to a black - tie house party			1
i insisted i was happy to stay in alone with the dog and watch tv			2
she did n't believe me			2
it 's that word ' happy ' everyone gets stuck on			1
for society has a blindspot when it comes to women like me			1
how can i be happy when i am 42 , without a man and childless ? they see me as a problem to be fixed , a conundrum to unravel			1
no one can rest until i 'm sorted			2
that is why i felt a surge of empathy when @entity26 hit out at the ongoing public fascination with her personal life			1
romance in the spotlight : now with @entity63 , @entity26 has faced constant speculation about her love life over the years the @entity67 actress spoke for happily unmarried women everywhere when she railed against society 's obsession with the traditional happy ending			1
this fixation has dogged miss @entity26 , 45 , more than any other celebrity i can think of			1
she must get sick of people speculating whether she is going to get married and why she has n't			2
and the endless guessing about whether or not she is pregnant must drive her mad			2
i have often thought how unfair this is			2
a gorgeous , witty , self - made woman , miss @entity26 ought to be inviting widespread admiration for her achievements			1
women who remain childless and single , whether by accident or design , belong to the fastest growing demographic of our age yet instead of lauding her accomplishments as a popular comic actress , the world continually asks when she is going to marry whoever she is dating - currently actor @entity63			1
as she pointed out , when she poked fun at the ongoing speculation at a recent women 's conference in the @entity96 , the assumption is that women are unfulfilled unless they have married and given birth			1
' being a woman , our value and worth is basically associated with our marital status or whether or not we have procreated , ' she told feminist and activist @entity103 at the makers @entity104 on women ’s issues in @entity107			2
she joked that people assumed single , childless women were ' in fact in deep s * * t '			1
what she means to highlight , of course , is that the exact opposite is the case			0
that she even has to point this out is astonishing in this day and age			0
women who remain childless and single , whether by accident or design , belong to the fastest growing demographic of our age			1
did n't work out : like the actress , who was married to @entity126 , @entity0 's relationship in her 30s did not last but , as miss @entity26 has found , and in my experience , too , we may as well still be in the @entity132			1
as a single woman , i often find myself the subject of people 's pity and , sometimes , their suspicion			1
no one , not even my closest friends , seems able to believe i am happy in my unattached state			1
when i tell them i do n't want to meet a man , they give me a look that says they think i am bravely whistling in the dark			0
' bless her heart , ' their concerned faces say			0
anyone would think i was a spinster in a @entity152 novel who will be destitute unless i can find a man to marry me they show ill - disguised disbelief when i assert that i do not want children any more			0
and because i am in my 40s , they leave me in no doubt that though they are doing their best to fix me up , it is a tough ask			1
i have been variously told by my matchmaker friends : ' i know a guy whose wife has just left him and he ca n't cope on his own ... my husband has a friend who 's just got divorced from a woman who beat him black and blue ... ' and my all - time favourite : ' there 's a guy living on a houseboat near us who seems like a real oddball			1
he 'd be perfect for you			0
' honestly , anyone would think i was a spinster in a @entity152 novel who will be destitute unless i can find a man to marry me			0
as for the gossip single women endure , i often feel as if i 've woken up in 1692 in @entity185 , @entity186 , during the witch trials			1
a few weeks ago , i went for dinner with a male friend , a divorced farmer			0
days later , a friend called me : ' the word going round is that you and the farmer are an item ! ' fancy free : the writer says you do n't need a man to be happy ' ca n't a woman have dinner with a male friend on a friday night ? ' i asked			2
last month , i went to a big formal dinner			0
as i arrived , one of the guests , there with his wife , greeted me , then looked behind me and said : ' who are you with ? ' ' no one , ' i said			0
' but who did you come with ? ' he asked , frowning			0
' i came with myself , ' i said , walking into the venue alone , as he stared at me as if i had walked in naked			0
there is something about a woman alone that still scandalises polite society			2
though we like to think of ourselves as advanced , we still see women as the weaker sex , in need of male support			2
even the term ' fix you up ' implies there is something to put right , that single women are broken and need mending			1
yes , there has been sadness in my life and romantic disappointment			0
did i set out to be on my own in my 40s ? probably not			2
it has happened , in large part , because i spent my mid- 30s with a man who did not want to settle down and have children			0
i do n't know the real story of miss @entity26 's marriage to @entity126 - when she was aged 30 to 35 - but i 'm guessing there may be similarities to my situation			1
i met the man i thought was the love of my life , a @entity240 broker called @entity244 , when i was 34 , and spent three turbulent years trying to persuade him to start a family			0
he was dead set against it , but i stayed with him because i was in love			0
by the time i accepted he was never going to agree to children , i was nearly 38			0
the child - bearing years of my life were almost gone			0
i spent a year getting over him and , by the time i was ready for another relationship , i was pushing 40 and getting pregnant was a whole different game			0
i could have tried , at 38 , to have a baby on my own with fertility treatment			0
at 40 , when i did meet someone else , i could have tried to start a family with him			0
but i am a great believer in accepting when a ship has sailed			0
i did n't feel it was right to immediately demand marriage and children of my most recent boyfriend , @entity266			0
i would rather enjoy what i have than hanker after what i do n't			0
no point regretting what might have been : @entity0 , pictured age 15 , did n't plan to be unmarried in her 40s @entity266 and i split up last year , but remain firm friends			1
even though the romance did n't work , we will always be there for each other			0
for me , the formal arrangement of a marriage just was n't meant to be			0
instead of a husband and children , i find fulfilment looking after my horses and spaniel pup			0
rather than regret what might have been , i make a virtue of the fact i am footloose and fancy free			0
i accept that a lot of the concern is well - meaning			0
just as my friends worry for me , miss @entity26 's fans fret about her finding a man who will look after her because they feel genuine affection for her			1
but i also believe the reason so many women identify with the @entity296 star is precisely because she is unmarried , childless and , by her insistence , happy			1
perhaps our obsession with the romantic happy ending is evolving			1
the more we happily unmarrieds go on being happy , and defying expectations , the more likely it is we will change perceptions			1
when i was writing my last book , the publisher asked me if the main character would end up with the man of her dreams			0
because it was a memoir based on my life , my publisher joked how brilliant it would be if i found a man , and a happy ending for the book , while i was writing it			1
i made the ending of the book suitably ambiguous			2
i am working on a novel and , again , find myself grappling with the same question			0
will my heroine live happily ever after because she finds a man ? or will she live happily ever after , even though she does n't ? i would like to think she is strong enough to find happiness either way			2

@entity0 was glad @entity26 recently spoke out for happily unmarried women everywhere
actress railed against society 's obsession with a traditional happy ending
@entity0 is fed up of friends trying to ' fix her up '
or feeling sorry for her because she 's single and childless in her 40s
