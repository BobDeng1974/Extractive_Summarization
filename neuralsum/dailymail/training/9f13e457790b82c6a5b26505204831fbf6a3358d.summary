@entity0 , one of the most controversial figures in @entity3 racing , has issued a plea to be allowed to pursue his aim of becoming a trainer after he and @entity7 were both cleared of a serious breach of the rules by a @entity12 disciplinary panel			1
the panel dismissed charges that @entity0 , a registered employee of @entity15 trainer @entity7 , had been training horses and running them under @entity7 ’s name			1
the pair , also accused of acting in a manner prejudicial to the integrity , proper conduct or good reputation of the sport , faced bans of up to three years			0
@entity0 wants his training application to be pushed through now he 's been cleared by the @entity12 @entity0 ’s application to become a trainer , lodged in may 2013 , has been on hold pending the outcome of the case			1
the prospect of him returning to the sport in a frontline role will fill the @entity12 with alarm but they will now have to grasp the issue			2
@entity0 , 54 , remains a figure who sharply divides opinion			2
a jockey who could turn race - riding into an art form , his biggest wins included the 1983 @entity43 on @entity44 and the @entity45 on @entity46			0
@entity0 ’s application to become a trainer has been on hold pending the outcome of the case in which it was claimed he trained horses and ran them under the name of his employer @entity7 ( pictured right ) but the stain on the reputation of a man , who also has operated as a successful bloodstock agent , is the five - year ban slapped on him by the @entity60 in 2002 for receiving money for tips from @entity63 , a man subsequently sent to jail for 30 years after being exposed as one of @entity3 ’s biggest drug dealers			1
@entity0 at the latter end of his often decorated career as a jockey that included wins in the 1983 @entity43 and 1996 @entity45 @entity0 said : ‘ things happened a long , long time ago			1
i am a lot older and wiser now			0
i regret things i have done in the past but i have committed the crime and paid the penalty			0
‘ it is time to move on and let me re-build my life for my family			0
‘ i applied for a licence on may 28 , 2013			2
i submitted a business plan and had a little yard			0
that yard has definitely gone but now this is out of the way i want to move on and look for another one			0
‘ i have been in racing a long time , it is my life			0
i was a very successful jockey and bloodstock agent			0
now hopefully they will let me get on with trying to be a successful trainer			0
’ the case against @entity0 and @entity7 was the first of its type ever pursued			1
asked if he thought the @entity12 ’s desire to keep him out of the sport had motivated the case , @entity0 added : ‘ they have a job to do and were acting on intelligence			1
‘ but myself and @entity7 told them what we were doing which was just working very hard to secure both our futures			1
thankfully , the panel has come to the right decision			2
’ the @entity12 said it was ‘ disappointed ’ by the @entity115 ’s verdict , adding a decision on @entity0 ’s trainer ’s licence application would not be made until it had had a chance to study the reasons for the decision			1
the @entity12 said it was ‘ disappointed ’ by the @entity115 ’s verdict and will study the reasons for the verdict before they make a call on @entity0 ’s trainer ’s licence application spokesman @entity121 said : ‘ it is too early to comment on how this process will now pan out but we will be in contact with @entity0 to discuss the status of his application in due course			1
the @entity115 ’s reasons will be integral to the way in which this matter is taken forward			0
’ in august , the @entity12 lifted a 10 - year ban on jockey @entity132 riding in @entity3 which had been imposed after he admitted stopping @entity133 from winning a race in august 2004 .			2
