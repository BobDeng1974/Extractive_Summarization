by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 17:11 est , 14 december 2013 when @entity2 and @entity3 made a commitment last january to buy only @entity6 products , they knew this @entity7 was going to be a challenge			1
toys for their three - year - old son @entity10 were likely to present a problem , as was finding @entity13 tinsel			0
yet even they did n’t predict they ’d have to forgo lighting the @entity7 pudding this year			0
they could n’t find any @entity6 matches			2
‘ it was a bit of a surprise , ’ admits @entity2 , a former lawyer from @entity19 in @entity20			1
‘ the match industry in the @entity6 is famous but now even the brand @entity24 , which has the big @entity25 on the box , says @entity24 ’s @entity27			2
’ @entity6 @entity7 : the @entity29 family have been buying @entity6 productions for the duration of 2013 and were surprised to find that buying @entity6 has been cheaper than buying from abroad the irony is not lost on the @entity33 , the self - styled , ‘ truly @entity6 family , ’ who have spent the last 12 months buying only goods made in the @entity6 and services supplied by @entity6 firms			1
everything from the clothes they wear to the wine they drink to the electricity that powers their two - bedroomed semi has been made or provided by a @entity6 company			1
@entity2 , 35 , and @entity3 , a 30 - year - old teacher , decided to embark on the project after reading about how little tax multi-national companies such as @entity49 pay while small @entity6 firms continue to struggle			1
and as they approach the end of the year , their venture , championed by @entity53 , has led to some unexpected discoveries , not least that buying @entity6 has been cheaper than buying from abroad			1
a true @entity58 roast : the @entity33 have made sure all their holiday food is from the @entity6 ( stock image ) @entity2 says : ‘ we are consistently finding that @entity6 products are cheaper			1
that ’s mainly because to buy @entity6 food means buying what is in season and , where possible , preserving them for eating at other times of year			1
‘ supermarkets are n’t a cheap option for buying food – though their marketing would suggest they are			2
’ the @entity33 expected to find clothing more difficult			2
while the @entity6 luxury goods sector is thriving , the high - street relies heavily on foreign imports			2
@entity3 says : ‘ there ’s a manufacturer who produces jeans in @entity79 , but they are perhaps not suitable to most frames , and they ’re £ 350 a pair			2
' but i got my dress from @entity84 in @entity85 for £ 30			0
' that is probably less than you would spend in @entity88 or @entity89			0
so options are limited , but when i found that company all of a sudden i could buy clothes			0
’ challenging the preconception that it is difficult to buy @entity6 has been one of the most interesting parts of the experiment for @entity2			1
he says : ‘ our story is a positive one in that we can say that @entity6 is able to produce things that rival any importer			2
’ there is also an important economic argument			0
@entity2 explains : ‘ an economist told us that if everybody in the @entity6 spent an extra £ 11 a week on @entity6 - made goods , it would help reduce the trade deficit within 12 months			1
‘ that ’s the power the consumer has on the economy			0
' we ’ve got to understand our place as consumers is very strong			0
but it is only strong if the stuff is there for us to choose			0
’ the latest challenge for the @entity29 family has been to put together a family @entity7			0
the decorations have been ordered from a handmade crafts website , @entity125 , and they also found tinsel in @entity127			0
meanwhile , a @entity85 business called @entity129 sells @entity6 - grown trees			2
the @entity33 have praised @entity131 and @entity132 for their efforts to back @entity6 - made goods , and they provided @entity6 paper chains			1
a spokesperson for @entity131 said : ‘ last year we increased the number of @entity6 suppliers by 57 per cent and we have set ourselves the target of increasing sales of @entity6 - made products by 15 per cent by the end of 2015			1
’ the biggest problem was finding anything suitable for @entity10 ’s stocking			0
@entity3 says : ‘ i wanted to buy @entity10 some @entity146 but you ca n’t get @entity6 ones any more			1
’ but at least one traditional @entity7 present staple – the @entity151 model – is about to be made in @entity6 again after company owners @entity153 reversed a decision made in the early 2000s to use factories in @entity157			1
the only rule the @entity33 set themselves was to buy products from @entity6 firms manufacturing in @entity6 , although they quickly realised the system made this difficult to stick to			1
@entity2 explains : ‘ for every sector the term “ manufacturing ” means something different			2
‘ on a mug , for example , it may say “ made in @entity6 ” but it could have been made in @entity157 and then transfer printed in the @entity6			1
’ and in this global age they have had to make some compromises			0
the couple have maintained their @entity174 account despite the fact it is an @entity177 company – and that has sometimes been crucial			0
@entity3 says : ‘ there have been times where we have been looking for a @entity6 product and we ’ve thought , “ it does n’t exist			1
” then you ’ll get someone who tweets “ have you heard of … ? ” you click the link and there it is			0
’ @entity2 says it is up to retailers to take responsibility and back @entity6 manufacturers			1
‘ so far we have found that @entity6 - made stuff , like clothes , is good quality and can be produced at a price that can still make firms a profit			1
‘ the manufacturing is there and is growing			0
the responsibility rests with retailers to stock this stuff			0
’ so , as the experiment draws to a close , what will the @entity33 do next ? @entity2 says : ‘ we always said we could end it if we wanted to but actually it feels less like an end and more we ’re just setting out on this adventure			1
we will carry on – but probably wo n’t be quite so strict with ourselves – as we ’ve found buying @entity6 works for us			1
‘ we are not out to tell others how to live , but we ’d like to help others who want to buy @entity6 too			2
’ toilet paper : @entity132 own - brand toilet roll ( and 90 per cent of @entity132 own - brand products ) are made in @entity6			1
tea : the @entity33 found an @entity58 tea grower , @entity215 , right , in @entity216			1
tablet computer : the @entity220 tablet , some components made abroad , but final manufacture takes place in @entity223 , @entity224			0
lava lamp : the @entity227 lava lamp has been made in @entity6 since 1963			1
digital music player : the @entity229 / 4			0
made in @entity6 by @entity230 of @entity231 , slogan : @entity6 made @entity233			1
matches : the famous brand @entity24 , right , is made in @entity236			0
lightbulbs : none made in @entity6			1
the family have survived on a handful of old bulbs			0
they will have to compromise in 2014			0
tinned tomatoes : @entity3 bought fresh tomatoes and dried them for use out of season			2
batteries : none are @entity6 made			2
bradshaws have eked out supplies this year , but another compromise is looming			0
printer ink : none made in @entity6 – so the @entity33 gave up printing from the computer			1
@entity256 : obviously not grown in @entity6			2
a staple the family have gone without			0
rubber gloves – rubber is not grown in @entity6			2
products are typically manufactured close to growers			0
social media : @entity174 , a thoroughly @entity177 company , has been essential to their campaign			0
transport : @entity2 has bought a @entity6 - made @entity267 motorbike			1
but @entity3 still drives their @entity269 car , a @entity271			0
they are considering a mini next year but their preferred model , the @entity275 , is made in @entity276			0
toys : very hard to find @entity6 - made toys			2
three - year - old @entity10 ’s favourite is a @entity280 – made in @entity157 .			0

@entity2 and @entity3 have been buying local for a year
the @entity20 couple found that a lot of the time , @entity6 is cheaper
the @entity33 have made sure all their holiday food is from the @entity6
