@entity0 missed an early penalty and had to wait until extra-time for redemption as his cool finish set holders @entity5 on their way to the last four of the @entity7			1
the @entity9 forward saw his weak spot - kick saved by man - of - the - match @entity11 after just four minutes but , following an entertaining stalemate in normal time , he made no mistake when sprung clear to break the deadlock in front of 11,664 inside @entity17			1
@entity0 – the second - youngest player in @entity19 history having made his debut with @entity21 aged 16 – is well thought of at @entity22 and has already won promotion to @entity25 ’s first - team squad this season			0
@entity0 ( centre ) celebrates goal which helped @entity5 to the @entity7 semi-final @entity0 ( centre ) had missed a penalty in the fourth minute of the game the youngster had to wait until extra-time to redeem himself before @entity5 added a third and fourth @entity35 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity11 ; @entity36 ( @entity37 110 ) , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 99 ) ; @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 59 ) ; @entity48 ( c ) subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , booked : @entity47 @entity52 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 ( @entity57 63 ) , @entity58 ; @entity59 ( c ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 97 ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 68 ) ; @entity0 subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 booked : @entity56 , @entity63 , @entity58 , @entity69 scorers : @entity0 , @entity63 , @entity69 referee : @entity72 attendance : 11,664 but the senior boss will not be impressed when he sees replays of the under - cooked penalty which should have set them on their way to a comfortable victory , such was their first - half dominance			1
as it was the brave @entity83 took the @entity84 to an additional 30 minutes and , after @entity0 ’s opener , fellow frontmen @entity63 and @entity62 settled an absorbing tie			1
@entity5 were all over their hosts during a frenetic opening and had their penalty when left - back @entity58 burst into the penalty area before accepting the invitation of @entity38 ’s outstretched leg and toppling to the turf			2
it looked a soft award and justice was served when @entity11 – shootout hero in the previous round at @entity100 – guessed right and dived low to his left to smother @entity0 ’s tame effort			2
the @entity102 were looking quicker and stronger than their hosts and @entity63 headed wide from @entity55 ’s delivery soon after – the @entity9 under - 18 should , on reflection , have tested @entity11			2
@entity63 must have thought he was about to open the scoring on 23 minutes when @entity69 drew back towards his unmarked feet eight yards from goal			0
@entity35 anchorman @entity42 , however , had read the unfolding danger and slid in to steal and clear			0
the dreadlocked @entity69 – on the books since the age of eight - was proving chief tormentor and he fashioned half a yard for a shot on the edge of the area before dispatching towards the top corner			0
@entity11 , though , is highly rated on @entity116 and it was easy to see why as he readjusted his feet to dive and fist clear			0
@entity62 was unlucky with this effort before hitting the target in extra-time @entity69 , who has been with @entity5 since he was eight years old , caused the @entity83 problems @entity0 ( centre ) impressed first - time manager @entity25 , earning a call up to the first team this season within 60 seconds @entity69 was taking aim once again , this time lashing over from 12 yards after spinning to connect with @entity63 ’s dinked delivery			1
@entity5 had one final chance to break parity before the interval but again @entity11 was equal to it , @entity64 ’s dipping free - kick smuggled clear by the inspired gloveman			2
@entity64 - the @entity136 midfielder formerly of @entity137 – was catching the eye with his daring runs from the middle of the park and shortly after the restart he slalomed into @entity144 ’s area only for his low poke to be flipped around the upright by @entity11			0
the win meant holders @entity5 reached their sixth successive @entity7 semi-final @entity35 had rarely ventured from their own half during the opening hour but , perhaps buoyed by the good fortune which kept the tie goalless , set after a breakthrough of their own			1
@entity45 dissected the visiting rearguard with a cute pass to free the front - running right - back @entity36 and his rising drive was helped over the crossbar by the previously untroubled @entity161			0
home striker @entity48 – with nine senior appearances this term – then chopped one way and the other inside the penalty area to work room for a shot but his stab was repelled by the well - placed @entity161			0
with legs beginning to tire and the game becoming stretched there were chances to be had			0
@entity5 were next to threaten and @entity63 – unguarded just six yards from goal – somehow headed wide when @entity60 landed a free - kick on his brow			1
@entity0 then blazed over from 18 yards and @entity63 , likewise , located the lower tier of the @entity179 when executing a spectacular bicycle kick in stoppage - time			1
but after a goalless 90 minutes the @entity84 were in front within four of the restart , @entity0 sprung clear before rounding @entity11 and coolly slotting home			2
@entity63 then got his goal with a cheeky dink over @entity11 and @entity69 settled the contest in injury - time with @entity63 the provider			1
it was belated , but deserved .			0

@entity0 broke the deadlock for @entity5 three minutes into extra-time
@entity63 *doubled* their lead with his *seventh* @entity7 goal
@entity62 rounded off the win a minute from time
@entity0 had a first - half penalty saved by @entity11
@entity35 *'s* @entity46 had to be carried off on a stretcher with an injury
