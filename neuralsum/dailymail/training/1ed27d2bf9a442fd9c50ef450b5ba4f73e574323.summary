by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 the biggest soda companies in the country promised to cut the calories @entity6 get from their drinks by a fifth - but will do it by clever marketing rather than changing the sodas themselves			1

however , the companies ' plan wo n't involve changing what 's in their sugary drinks - but by promoting their lower - calorie alternatives , cutting portion sizes and making people more aware of the amount of sugar in regular sodas			1
cut calories : the companies have said they want to reduce the number of calories consumed as a result of their products - but will do so by plugging low - calorie products rather than changing what 's in them the companies - whose full - calorie products are already in decline - made the promise today alongside the rest of the @entity42 at a @entity44 summit arranged by the @entity45 and supported by former president @entity46			1

' now he prefers water and iced tea			0
@entity105 , the president of the @entity42 , said the plan will build on earlier success			0
