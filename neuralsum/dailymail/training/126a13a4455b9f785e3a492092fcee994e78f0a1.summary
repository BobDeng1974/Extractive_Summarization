@entity11 was in it , they were told - he had escaped and was found dead under a house			1
@entity36 never accepted the story			0
she waited for him to come home			0
sadly , the researchers were unable to determine how @entity11 did in fact die , and they will probably never know			1

this december 20 , 2013 , file photo provided by the @entity9 , shows where researchers found some of the remains of 55 people in a graveyard associate professor @entity30 , center , facing camera , is pictured during the excavation of bodies late last year official records showed 31 burials at the @entity29 school between its opening in 1900 and its 2011 closure for budget reasons , but researchers found the remains of 24 additional people between last september and december			1
some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse , but the @entity96 concluded after an investigation that it could n't substantiate or dispute the claims because too much time had passed			1
many former @entity101 inmates from that era call themselves ' the @entity13 ' after the white building where they say the worst abuse took place			2
in 2008 , the @entity106 held a ceremony to officially ' seal ' the building and recognize the boys who passed through it			0

@entity34 , sister of @entity26 , the first victim positively identified , gathers up an undated family photo of @entity11 , after a news conference thursday @entity34 said her older brother would wear a guitar string around his neck and that the family would sing country - western songs for entertainment			1
he had n't been in trouble before the stolen car , she said			0
over the years , the family had kept his wallet , which was displayed at thursday 's press conference			1
' it was important to him and i often wondered why he left it , ' @entity34 said			2

at its peak in the 1960s , 500 boys were housed at the @entity148 school , most of them for minor offenses such as petty theft , truancy or running away from home			2
in 1968 , when corporal punishment was outlawed at state - run institutions , then - governor @entity153 visited and found the institution in disrepair with leaky ceilings , holes in walls , cramped sleeping quarters , no heating for the winters and buckets used as toilets			2
@entity34 , sister of @entity11 , talks of her brother who was 14 when he disappeared from the school in 1940 , and was never seen alive by his family again ' if one of your kids were kept in such circumstances , ' he said then , ' you 'd be up there with rifles			1
' some of the bodies were found under roads or overgrown trees , well away from the white , metal crosses marking the 31 officially recorded graves			0
@entity30 , the lead researcher and an associate anthropology professor , said another body could soon be identified			0
