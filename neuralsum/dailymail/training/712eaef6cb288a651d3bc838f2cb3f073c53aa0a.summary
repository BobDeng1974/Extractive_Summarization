at the event , @entity1 described the prince as ' a really cool guy , very much part of the team '			1
it must have taken him 40 minutes at least to build , they were just fabulous			0
i would often sit on the latrine thinking " this is a royal flush in every way ! " ' @entity2 also massively helped me out when i was struggling with my skis at first			2
he was a great guy			0
' @entity1 also lifted the lid on some of the group 's celebrations on reaching the @entity55			1
he said : ' two of the @entity58 guys stripped naked and ran round the pole but most of us , @entity2 included , just went on a two - day bender with the @entity63 truck drivers who had brought some lethal home brew with them			2
there was a lot of liqueur drunk			0
' we all drank champagne out of @entity71 's ( @entity70 , a double amputee injured in @entity73 in 2009 , who was on the @entity75 team ) favourite prosthetic legs			2
' and @entity2 's greatest talent ? ' well he told some eye - wateringly rude jokes which for a non-soldier like me was pretty shocking ! ' @entity1 revealed			1
actor @entity1 , who was part of the @entity12 team trekking with @entity2 , described him as a ' fantastically nice chap ' the prince was joined by fellow members of the three teams of wounded servicemen and women who successfully trekked to the @entity55 in december 2013 the prince appeared at an official event for the first time today since the challenge looking fresh - faced and clean - shaven			1
speaking at the press conference to mark the charity trek , the prince ’s enthusiasm for the cause was clear			1
he said : ‘ inspiring others is one of the cornerstones of this charity			2
to demonstrate to those who have suffered lifechanging injuries that anything is still possible			0
' that this truly unbelievable achievement by everyone behind me ... will remind everybody that they can achieve anything they want to			0
our wounded , injured and sick [ servicemen ] they simply want to be treated the same way as before they were injured			2
‘ for some the journey may be more of a challenge and it is up to us to make it as easy for them as we can			0
we can do that with training , with employment , or even with adventure			0
the royal was full of praise for his teammates during the trip , all of whom have suffered terrible injuries fighting for their country , including one soldier who lost both his legs in @entity73 @entity1 lifted the lid on some of the group 's celebrations on reaching the @entity55 , which included drinking champagne out of a prosthetic leg ' if anyone has the ability to give these guys and girls a stepping stone as regards employment , then please do			1
you wo n’t regret it			0
’ his teammate @entity70 added : ‘ @entity2 was a real team player			2
there was always something to do and he was always instigating it			0
there were so many wind ups			0
he probably spread himself quite thin			0
he would spend time with each team every day			0
he was always making sure he mixed , bringing everyone to the fore			0
it was very nice as he was as tired as everybody else			0
‘ referring to the team ’s post trek champagne antics , he said : ‘ we decided to use my legs as a primitive ice bucket			2
i do n’t know why we did it , but we did ! ’ the fourth - in - line - to - the - throne started to grow his beard after being unable to shave during his three weeks on the ice but decided to keep it even when he returned to the @entity75 just before @entity172			1
on christmas day his ginger whiskers were just as much of a draw at @entity175 as the @entity176 and @entity177 and sparked an outbreak of ‘ pogonomania ’ ( an obsession with seeing men with beards ) on social media			0
prince @entity2 speaks at the walking with the wounded ' welcome home ' press conference in @entity23 his facial hair even inspired articles in publications as far as the @entity190 and @entity58 , with @entity192 magazine describing it as ‘ grizzly , red and perfect ’			1
in recent weeks there were claims that the @entity198 , who has famously barred her servants from sporting beards as she thinks facial hair looks unprofessional , had demanded her grandson shave it off			2
this was dismissed by palace sources , however , who said the prince had decided to keep it because he fancied a change and would probably just shave it off before he went back to work			0
@entity2 himself told well - wishers at @entity175 that he had decided to keep it because it was something of a royal tradition – no doubt referring to the beards previously grown by his brother , prince @entity218 , father , prince @entity219 , and grandfather , prince @entity221 , when away on military duties			1
last week he was photographed walking with his girlfriend , @entity223 , with his beard still intact , but by thursday he appeared to have shaved it off , according to reports on social media			1
speaking at the press conference to mark the event , the prince ’s enthusiasm for the cause was clear and today all eyes were on the prince as he attended the press conference at the @entity236 in @entity237 , just down from his apartment at @entity239			1
the prince was joined by fellow members of the three teams of wounded servicemen and women who successfully trekked to the @entity55 in december 2013			1
the walking with the @entity245 2013 saw the servicemen and women skiing across 208 miles of some of the most inhospitable conditions known to man , with temperatures of up to minus 50 degrees and biting winds			0
every man and woman – some of whom were double amputees - also had to pull a custom built arctic sledge known as a pulk , weighing in excess of 11 stone , carrying their kit			0
last week prince @entity2 announced he was quitting his job as an @entity266 attack helicopter pilot , after two frontline tours of @entity73 , to take a desk job in @entity23 organising ceremonial events			1
pictured , right , is a bearded prince @entity219 as he leaves a plane from @entity271 the terrain was so challenging that organisers were forced to suspend the race element of the trek and group all the competitors together for safety			2
such was the camaraderie , however , the men and women linked hands as they walked the last few yards of the route to stand together at the bottom of the world			0
the teams spent a total of four weeks in @entity288 , including the acclimatisation period and end of the expedition			0
the trek began on december 1st with the teams reaching the @entity55 on friday december 13th			1

@entity2 , who was also patron of the expedition , said from the ice afterwards : ‘ every single one of these 12 deserves it			2
all 12 of them have different reasons for being here ... but i ’m so proud , i ’m so chuffed , i ’m so privileged to be here with all these guys and girls			0
‘ i think we ’ll be having a few whiskies tonight and then everyone ’s looking forward to getting home			0
