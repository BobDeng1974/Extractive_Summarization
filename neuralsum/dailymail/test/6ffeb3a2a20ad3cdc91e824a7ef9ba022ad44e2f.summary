too strong , too hungry and too powerful			0
all over the field @entity0 were superior			2
it has been a while since we have said that , in this fixture at least			0
a season that seemed to be heading nowhere when @entity6 defeated them in the @entity8 last month will perhaps now be remembered for a return to @entity11 football and also for this , a victory over their neighbours that was even more complete , more absolute , than the scoreline suggests			2
@entity0 used to do this to @entity18 all the time			1
they used to bully them , pass through them , demoralise them and embarrass them			0
but not since 2009 - 10 when @entity0 beat @entity18 twice in the @entity24 and edged a @entity26 semi-final have they brutalised them like this			1
@entity30 roars with @entity31 after the influential @entity32 gave the @entity33 an advantage they never looked like relinquishing @entity31 leaps to meet man - of - the - match @entity35 's superb cross with a thumping header to send @entity30 into a state of euphoria @entity18 's defence was caught flatfooted and @entity41 could only watch as @entity31 's header flew into the net on a great day for the hosts @entity45 was released by @entity46 and the @entity47 ran through to shoot between @entity41 's legs to extend the host 's advantage @entity45 once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy , poise and intelligence @entity58 showed his hunger to beat a lethargic @entity18 defence to @entity35 's free - kick to add a fourth to give the score more gloss all of @entity0 's outfield players congratulate @entity58 after his close - range header ensured the red side of @entity68 has bragging rights young latches on to a loose ball which bounced off @entity71 and fires past the despairing dive of @entity41 to level matters @entity46 cannons the ball into the net in celebration to release a shower of water as @entity45 and @entity35 charge to the sidelines @entity82 finishes off a surgical move for the opener , tapping @entity86 's cross into the empty net to give the visitors hope the @entity0 defence looked at sixes and sevens as @entity93 fumes after conceding an early goal to their @entity18 rivals @entity82 made it a double late of , latching on to @entity98 's cross , but @entity18 leave @entity30 with very little to cheer about time will tell what the ramifications will be			1
@entity0 will surely take third place in the league			2
that looks a certainty now			0
for @entity18 , everything suddenly seems unclear , including their manager ’s position and their own place in the top four			0
here at a rapturous @entity30 , @entity0 played like a team that had been waiting for this day			0
@entity18 looked like a team waiting for the season to end			2
@entity18 actually bookended this game with two very good goals , @entity82 scoring in the eighth and 88th minutes			1
what happened in between , however , served to confirm recent indications that @entity0 have finally found their true selves while @entity18 have fallen off the edge of the proverbial cliff			1
the home team had all the game ’s best players			0
@entity31 , @entity35 , @entity124 and @entity45 were all excellent and key to events			1
@entity18 , on the other hand , hardly had a player who will reflect on this comfortably			0
for 10 minutes , @entity18 were excellent			2
they have grown used to coming here and starting like this			0

check out more from @entity169 @entity170 shifts uncomfortably in his seat during a torrid afternoon for his rudderless side , who are now six points behind @entity0 @entity150 , who was anonymous all afternoon , trudges towards the centre circle after @entity18 concede another goal to the @entity33 many felt @entity159 was fortunate to escape with just a booking after this challenge on @entity124 just before the half - time whistle the @entity181 flew into the air after @entity159 's stud high tackle just before the break and many felt he was lucky to just receive a booking @entity162 books the @entity18 captain , who was substituted immediately after half - time last season @entity156 scored early and the game finished 3 - 0			1
this time , a move began by @entity71 and soon joined by a @entity86 dash to the by - line was finished off by @entity82			1
a goal ahead and with three clear chances already to reflect on , @entity18 seemed to have given themselves a platform while @entity0 looked hesitant			1
@entity86 seemed to be readying himself for a stellar afternoon			0
@entity0 , though , have been running hot on belief recently and that has made an enormous difference to their play			0
the fact they managed to fashion an equaliser from a position of vulnerability spoke volumes			0
goalkeeper @entity93 actually looked to be in trouble as @entity148 attempted to run on to a short back - pass in the 14th minute and the ensuing clearance was more of a hack than a measured pass to the left wing			0
but when @entity31 won a challenge with @entity98 opportunity suddenly beckoned			1
the ball broke to @entity137 and when he crossed to the near post @entity35 edged his dual with @entity71 to nudge the ball over the line after it broke off both of them			2
@entity46 leaps onto @entity31 's back after @entity0 take the lead through the big @entity32 , who has had an excellent renaissance recently @entity137 skips inside fellow countryman @entity86 during another decent showing from the @entity47 , who pulled the strings @entity45 gives @entity71 something to think about as the mercurial @entity47 plots another attack for the hosts coming at a time when @entity0 had looked weak , the psychological effects of the equaliser were immediate and far reaching			1
the momentum of the game shifted towards red and @entity18 never managed to reverse it			2
@entity0 were not particularly fluent and it was , for a while , a tight game played in an atmosphere that reflected the stakes			2
however , the home team looked to have more energy , more purpose and more conviction			0
this is what confidence does to a team and by the 21st minute they were in the lead			0
this time , @entity18 had to ask themselves questions and over the remainder of the game it became a theme			1
the threat in the air from @entity31 was obvious but somehow he managed to isolate @entity71 at the far post as @entity35 crossed above the head of the taller @entity147 , who was essentially marking nobody			1
it was , as the bare facts suggest , a mismatch and @entity31 powered above his opponent to head the ball through @entity41 and in to the corner			2
less than a quarter of the game had gone but already the road back for @entity18 looked long			2
from that point on until @entity82 ’s late consolation , @entity18 hardly made a chance			1
@entity82 finished off an incisive @entity18 move which cut through @entity0 's defence in an impressive opening spell @entity0 went back to basics for the leveller , with @entity35 pouncing after @entity137 's cross hit @entity71 @entity0 exploited @entity18 's right wing for their second too , with @entity35 and @entity124 combining to great effect intelligent play from @entity46 set up the third , with @entity45 darting through and coolly slotting home @entity58 rose unmarked to head @entity35 's free - kick beyond @entity41 to make it 4 - 1 for rampant @entity0 @entity82 gave a semblance of respectability to the scoreline by meeting @entity98 's cross late on as half - time neared , their captain @entity159 could have been sent off for a lunge at @entity293			1
as it was , he strained a muscle making the challenge and did n’t reappear for a second period that began with @entity41 saving @entity46 ’s free - kick and then @entity135 ’s follow - up			1
@entity18 desperately needed a foothold but could n’t find one			0
they enjoyed some possession but conviction was absent and when @entity147 dashed senselessly from his position @entity293 and @entity46 were able to pick up the pieces to play in @entity45 , who looked offside , for the decisive third goal			0
from here on in , only the winning margin was in doubt and when @entity58 ran off @entity147 ’s shoulder to head in the fourth from a @entity35 free - kick anything seemed possible			1
as it turned out the final act belonged to @entity82 — @entity98 the provider this time — and the winning margin settled at a rather modest two			1
that does n’t tell the story , though			0
@entity0 were dominant and , at times , rather rampant			0
for the first time in a while , they held @entity18 in their grip			2
afterwards , @entity322 suggested he would spend the evening at his favourite @entity68 restaurant , wings			0
his team , finally , are in flight			0
sir @entity328 returned to his old stomping ground to see his former charges beat the ' noisy neighbours ' @entity332 shares a joke before kick - off and will have been pleased with several performances @entity0 co-chairmen @entity336 ( right ) was also in the stands to see a vital derby victory			1

@entity82 opened scoring in the 8th minute , tapping in @entity86 's *pinpoint* cross
young levels minutes six minutes later , *reacting* to a loose ball in the box
@entity31 nods in @entity35 's cross for his sixth of the season in the 28th minute
@entity45 *punished* weak @entity18 defending to add a *breakaway* third in the 66th
an unmarked @entity58 *nodded* home @entity35 's free - kick to make it four
@entity82 finished @entity98 's cross to add a his second late on
@entity159 's challenge on @entity124 attracted *criticism* - and a booking - and he was subbed after half - time
@entity18 had won the last four @entity68 derbies but sank to their fourth defeat in six @entity24 games
for @entity0 , this was a sixth *successive* win , and a *hugely* impressive one
