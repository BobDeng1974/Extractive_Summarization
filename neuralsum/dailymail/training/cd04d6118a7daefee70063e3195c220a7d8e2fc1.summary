by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 10:46 est , 15 november 2012 an artist intends to sue the organisers of the @entity3 because he believes director @entity4 used his design for the opening ceremony set			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , entered drawings of a spiral mound in the middle of the countryside into an arts competition held by @entity15 chiefs			1
after not winning , he thought no more of it until he saw the @entity19 director 's memorable opening ceremony in july this year			1
familiar look ? @entity7 's @entity3 design for features a small lake , low - lying clouds and giant spiral - shaped mound as the centrepiece , with a man holding a torch on top ' @entity29 ' : director @entity4 's set for the spectacular £ 27million opening ceremony has a very similar design mr @entity7 noticed that the spiral - shaped , verdant hill that formed the centrepiece of the spectacular event looked remarkably similar to the one he had entered into the 2009 competition			1
the 42 - year - old has now taken legal advice with a view to suing the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) for breach of copyright			2
mr @entity7 and his friend @entity44 entered their ‘ @entity46 ’ design as part of an @entity49 competition held in conjunction with @entity3			1
the idea was for artists to come up with a project , such as a sculpture , that was associated with @entity56 regions			0
mr @entity7 decided to build a grassy , spiral mound in @entity58 and created a series of postcards depicting the concept			1
his design also included a small lake , low - lying clouds and a man running up the mound with the @entity15 torch - all of which also featured in @entity4 's ceremony			1
competition : mr @entity7 , left , says he is not angry but would like recognition from @entity4 , right , and is hoping to sue the organising committee - if he can afford it the competition ’s aim was not to find ideas for the opening ceremony , but mr @entity7 claims the organisers based the final product on his design			1
mr @entity7 said : ' i entered the competition in the @entity58 heat and did a brief proposal about building a spiral mound in @entity58			1
' i was lucky enough to be short - listed but was n’t selected as the eventual winner			2
' i moved on and put the idea on the shelf			0
there was still a possibility of doing it in the future			0
' about two weeks before the @entity3 , i saw an article in a newspaper which set out the design for the opening ceremony and there was a picture of a model by @entity4			2
the model had so many similarities to so much of our work			0
' our version was the mounds through the ages and the 2012 model looked like what ended up in the opening ceremony			2
' i did n’t invent spiral mounds			0
the notion is n’t original but there were just too many similarities for it to be a coincidence , given that we had entered an @entity15 competition			0
' iconic images : the 42 - year - old artist was convinced that @entity4 must have seen his competition entry from 2009 after watching the @entity3 opening ceremony , pictured another view : @entity41 insist that the opening ceremony design was based on the @entity121 in @entity122 , pictured the ‘ @entity29 ’ opening ceremony was seen by 26.9million people across the country			1
it had the largest average audience for any broadcast since 1996 and was one of the top 20 most - watched @entity131 television broadcasts of all time			0
mr @entity133 has consulted lawyers about taking legal action but says the cost involved could force him to abandon his plans			0
he said : ' i ’m not angry , it ’s more like a feeling of bemusement			0
did i give away a concept that was used as the centrepiece of a £ 27million event ? ' people were getting in touch with me on the night asking if @entity4 had got our permission to use our idea			1
' if they were in any way inspired by our idea then @entity44 and i should have had some form of recognition			0
' somebody like @entity4 saying these artists from @entity8 came up with this idea , that would obviously be very nice			0
' a @entity3 spokeswoman denied the organisers had used mr @entity7 ’s idea and said their set had been inspired by @entity121			2
he said : ' @entity4 was not involved in the taking the lead programme , which was funded by the @entity49 , and would not have seen any of the submissions			2
' @entity4 ’s vision for the opening set for the @entity166 was inspired by the very well known @entity121 landmark and @entity131 history			0

@entity7 , 42 , created several postcards for a competition held by @entity3 and the @entity49 in 2009
he believes the @entity19 director must have seen his design - which also features a spiral - shaped mound , low - lying clouds and a lake
the artist says he would like some recognition because he is convinced his concept was used in the £ 27million ceremony
