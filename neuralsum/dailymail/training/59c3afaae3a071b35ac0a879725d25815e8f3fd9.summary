by @entity1 reporter shocking video from the mountains of @entity4 show a a 500 - pound bomb dropped by @entity7 bombers land on a @entity9 infantry outpost after the bombers mistook the outpost for a @entity13 hideout			1
the dramatic video shows soldiers at the outpost watch as an @entity18 bomber flew overhead			1
seconds after seeing the bomber , there is a loud explosion , and the soldiers reacting with poise amongst the chaos caused by the explosion			2
thankfully , there were no casualties caused by what appears to be a mistake made by pilot of the bomber			2
simultaneously , airstrikes were called in to take out the opposition forces			0
it appears , however , that the pilot mistook the @entity9 outpost for the @entity13 fighters and dropped a 500 - pound bomb on their location - narrowly missing the soldiers at the outpost			1
' honestly we had dropped so many bombs up to that point that the thought never even crossed my mind that this could even happen , especially with all the checks put into place , ' one of the soldiers tells the website			0
' about a half second before impact you could hear the bomb screaming in like i had nâ€™t ever heard before , and i definitely knew at that point something was off			0
' @entity84 : the soldiers were rattled by the initial explosion , but luckily none of them were killed or injured the enemy : soldiers spotted @entity13 fights on a ridge line far from their camp , and an air strike had been ordered to take them out rattled : the bomb hit just feet away from the @entity9 outpost , where soldiers fire mortars at enemy fighters the soldier says the impact was so powerful that it knocked people to the ground			1
' after the initial realization that it had hit behind us , we were so scatter brained trying to figure out what happened			0
it hit so close to the guys in the tower it actually knocked the fill out of radios , ' he said			0
' once the smoke had cleared and we realized that no one was seriously injured , we were just sitting there in awe as the anger started to build , ' he continued			0
it remains unclear what caused this near - fatal mistake .			1

the bomber apparently mistook the @entity7 soldiers for @entity13 fighters
the bombing happened in the @entity56 along the @entity58 border
it remains unclear what led to the near - fatal mistake
