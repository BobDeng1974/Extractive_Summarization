or perhaps it 's just a case of @entity1 holiday japes			2
whatever the story behind these remarkable pictures , they show the @entity17 director in an entirely different light to the troubled genius whose legacy has been sullied by his reputation for cruelty			2
the previously unpublished album is believed to have belonged to director @entity25 , for whom the young @entity1 worked as an assistant early in his film career			1
dating from the early to mid- 1920s , many of the pictures show @entity1 , @entity25 and others , including @entity1 's future wife @entity31 , in @entity6 , @entity32 , the location of a small film studio			1
they appear to be living a happy - go - lucky existence , play acting by the beach , rough housing in the sea and devouring film magazines , as they meanwhile work on pictures			2
these images date from just after the making of @entity25 's hit film @entity44 , which brought him together with @entity1 as assistant director in the @entity48 - @entity47 company			1

1923 ' shows a young , moustachioed @entity1 wearing a figure - hugging dress while gurning at the camera during a game of tennis			1
cross-dressing killer @entity9 was later to become one of the director 's most - famous characters in the 1960 movie @entity17 , a film which has come to define @entity1 's style of psychological horror			1
@entity61 , a @entity1 biographer , said that the dressing was probably just for a laugh			0
he told the @entity64 : ' i know that @entity1 did occasionally like to put on women 's clothes , but just for fun at parties			2
' these photos humanise @entity1 , particularly as people now tend to think of him as a fat sadist			0

by this time , @entity1 was increasingly beginning to dominate over his old boss , making the acquaintance of luminaries of the @entity87 expressionist movement which was later to strongly influence his work			2
