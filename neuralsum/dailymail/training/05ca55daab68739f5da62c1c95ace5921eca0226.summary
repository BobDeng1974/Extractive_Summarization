a new petrol price war erupted yesterday on the back of falling oil prices and the first 99p per litre forecourt in @entity4 for more than five years			1
@entity5 sparked a 2p per litre price cut as the three other ‘ @entity10 ’ supermarkets - @entity7 , @entity8 ’s and @entity9 – swiftly followed suit			1
price cuts will ‘ ripple ’ through the nation ’s forecourts by putting pressure on other retailers to match them or lose business			2
but it also led to calls for the chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years			1
pumps at the @entity28 's forecourt in @entity29 , @entity30 run empty of unleaded fuel after the service station reduced the price of unleaded petrol to 99.7p a litre the price drop prompted @entity5 to cut prices by 2p per litre and @entity7 , @entity8 's and @entity9 quickly followed suit the @entity9 cut took affect yesterday while reductions by the other three companies will kick in today			1
for @entity5 customers , the latest reduction means they will pay no more than 103.7p a litre on petrol , with diesel at 110.7p a litre			1
the reductions have come after a chain of three @entity28 filling stations in @entity30 and the west midlands cut the price of petrol to 99.7p a litre			1
the @entity53 has been forecasting for weeks that petrol prices would dip below the £ 1 - a - litre mark and welcomed the news of the @entity30 service station price cut			1
as average prices continue to fall closer to the £ 1 mark , the @entity53 said the 99p charge could soon become the rule rather than the exception			0
fuel price trackers @entity62 said the average price before the supermarkets announced their cuts was 108.9p per litre for unleaded and 115.98 for diesel			2
ironically however , as the price of the fuel product itself falls , the proportion of the pump price which is tax going to the chancellor has increased - and represents now more than 70 per cent of the price of unleaded petrol now goes to the chancellor in tax			1
this is because duty is levied at a fixed rate of 57.95p and does not fall in line with the falling cost of the product			0
@entity85 is then levied on the total price including duty , accounting for around 18p per litre			0
so even though the price is dropping , the chancellor ’s tax take remains largely unaffected other than a drop in vat			2
@entity5 said the 2p price reduction across its 245 filling stations was the fifteenth fuel cut since end of september , taking a total of 23p per litre off unleaded and 19p per litre off diesel , @entity5 ’s senior vice president @entity92 said : ‘ @entity5 once again are leading this next round of price cuts			1
@entity28 petrol station 's owner smiles after his unleaded petrol has run dry due to price cuts			1
the @entity53 said the 99p charge could soon become the rule rather than the exception ‘ no matter where customers live , they will benefit from the same fuel price with our national price cap of 103.7ppl for unleaded and 110.7ppl for diesel			2
’ he said : ‘ whilst other supermarkets will follow the fuel price drop , @entity5 is the only retailer that has a national price cap on fuel at all 245 filling stations			1
’ @entity53 fuel spokesman @entity122 said : ‘ the decision of three forecourts in the @entity126 to sell petrol for under £ 1 a litre – last seen in 2009 – is clearly having a ripple effect on the supermarkets as they are continuing to bring their prices lower still			0
’ he said that with a barrel of oil now costing around $ 47 ‘ we are surely only weeks away from the milestone price of £ 1 a litre being a common sight at petrol stations up and down the country ’			2
‘ this will also have a very positive effect on reducing the average price of both petrol and diesel for motorists everywhere			0
’ but he added : ’ we are now getting to a point where the share that the @entity149 takes from the forecourt price is nearing 75per cent which is a bitter pill for motorists and retailers			0
we should perhaps be seeking a commitment from all the major political parties that they will not look to increase fuel duty in the next parliament			0
’ but price cuts also led to calls for the chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years professor @entity166 , director of the @entity53 , agreed : ‘ an astonishing 70p in every pound we spend at the pumps is now destined for government			1
‘ because fuel duty is set at a flat rate and makes up the bulk of fuel taxation , the chancellor is able to rely on his tax income from fuel remaining quite steady even as the underlying price of petrol and diesel falls			2
‘ last week the chancellor again publicly urged fuel companies to pass on oil price reductions to motorists			0
clearly he thinks the price of fuel is still too high			0
well he has an easy solution			0
’ professor @entity166 estimates that @entity4 drivers collectively are £ 330million better off each month compared with last summer because of price reductions at the pumps : ‘ yet they could be better off still , and have more money to spend on the high street , if the chancellor revised downwards the huge proportion of tax he takes from motorists and hauliers			0
’ @entity198 president @entity197 said : ‘ there remains a postcode lottery out there when it comes to fuel prices			0
drivers in rural areas are still paying much more than the £ 1.09 average price and in some places £ 1.18			0
‘ it will still take some time to get down to an average of £ 1 per litre , particularly as 70per cent of the pump price is tax ( 57.95p duty and 18.3p vat ) .			2

@entity7 , @entity8 's and @entity9 followed @entity5 's price cut
*spurred* after three @entity28 filling stations in @entity30 and west midlands cut price of petrol to 99.7p a litre
@entity5 customers will pay no more than 103.7p a litre on petrol
price cuts led to calls for chancellor to cut fuel tax
currently accounts for more than 70p per pound spent at the pump
