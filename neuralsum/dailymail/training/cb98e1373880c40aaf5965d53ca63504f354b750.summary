just weeks after being given an intravenous stem cell treatment from umbilical cord blood , the symptoms of a boy who had been left in a vegetative state after a heart attack improved considerably			1
within months he could talk and move			2
the @entity16 doctors who carried out the treatment say the results of the treatment dispel ' long - held doubts ' surrounding the effectiveness of stem cell therapy			1
doctors have successfully treated paediatric cerebral palsy with umbilical cord blood for the first time , on a patient known only l.b. they say the breakthrough dispels ' long - held doubts ' surrounding the effectiveness of stem cell therapy after going into cardiac arrest in november 2008 , the unnamed two - year - old boy , known only as @entity30 , was left paralysed with severe brain damage and in a vegetative state			1
doctors warned his parents that his chances of survival were minimal			1
they researched the options open to them			0
until now , there has been no treatment for the cause of what is known as infantile cerebral palsy			0
' in their desperate situation , the parents searched the literature for alternative therapies , ' said dr. @entity48 of the @entity49 , who carried out the new treatment			0
' they contacted us and asked about the possibilities of using their sonâ € ™ s cord blood , frozen at his birth			1
' nine weeks after the brain damage , on 27 january 2009 , the doctors administered the prepared blood intravenously			2
they studied the progress of recovery at two , five , 12 , 24 , 30 , and 40 months after his brain injury			0
usually , the chances of survival after such a severe brain damage and more than 25 minutes duration of resuscitation are six per cent			2
before his treatment , the patient had been in a persistent vegetative state for nine weeks due to having a heart attack months after the severe brain damage , the surviving children usually only exhibit minimal signs of consciousness			1
' the prognosis for the little patient was threatening if not hopeless , ' the @entity77 medics say			0
but just two months after treatment with the cord blood containing stem cells , his symptoms improved significantly			1
over the following months , the child learned to speak simple sentences and to move			2
' our findings , along with those from a @entity89 study , dispel the long - held doubts about the effectiveness of the new therapy , ' , said dr. @entity48 of the @entity49			1
within two months , the boy 's muscle spasticity decreased significantly			0
he was able to see , sit , smile , and to speak simple words again			0
just weeks after being given an intravenous stem cell treatment the boy 's symptoms improved considerably and within months he could talk and move around 40 months after treatment , the child was able to eat independently , walk with assistance , and form four - word sentences			1
' of course , on the basis of these results , we can not clearly say what the cause of the recovery is , ' dr @entity48 said			0
' it is , however , very difficult to explain these remarkable effects by purely symptomatic treatment during active rehabilitation			0
' in animal studies , stem cells have been shown to migrate to damaged brain tissue			0
in a previous study with rats , researchers revealed that cord blood cells migrate to the damaged area of the brain in large numbers within 24 hours of administration			2
in march 2013 , in a controlled study of 100 children , @entity89 doctors reported for the first time that they had successfully treated cerebral palsy with allogeneic cord blood			2
dr @entity48 and his colleague @entity135 of the @entity136 at the @entity77 ( @entity137 of the @entity138 ) , reported their success in journal @entity140 in @entity142 .			0

the child was left in a vegetative state after going into cardiac arrest
