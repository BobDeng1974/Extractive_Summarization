by @entity0 a poor @entity2 couple have made a desperate appeal for financial help to save the life of their son who was born with his heart outside his body			2
@entity10 , 24 , was rushed to the labour room of the government - run @entity12 in @entity15 state late last wednesday where she gave birth to a baby boy			1
but the baby was born with the incredibly rare condition ectopia cordis , which left his heart protruding from his chest , and now needs expensive emergency surgery to prevent him from dying within days			1
warning graphic content in need : the as - yet - unnamed baby was born in @entity15 state on wednesday			1
he is suffering from ectopia cordis - an incredibly rare heart condition gave birth : @entity10 , 24 , ( pictured with baby ) was rushed to the labour room of the government - run @entity12 in @entity15 state late last wednesday the incredibly rare condition affects only eight in every one million births , with 90 per cent of these babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days			1
ectopia cordis is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside the thorax			1
the condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen , although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a split sternum			2
incredibly rare , the condition only only eight in every one million births , with 90 per cent of these babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days - usually through infection , hypoxemia , or cardiac failure			1
although the exact cause is unknown , ectopia cordis is thought to be related to problems with the development of the baby 's lateral plate mesoderm in early pregnancy			2
the development of the muscles that hold the baby 's organs in place fails , leading to them bursting through barely developed muscle and bone , and continuing to grow outside the skin			0
the fact this baby - who has not yet been named - has survived into his sixth day means he has already beaten odds of less than one in a million			1
but if he is to survive much longer , the baby boy needs to have emergency surgery at a private hospital , as none of the state - run facilities in the area are able to carry out the complex operation			2
the family are desperately poor , however , living on father @entity80 's income of less than £ 3 a day and there is no way they can fund the private healthcare without help			1
mr @entity80 , 30 , who works as a mason at construction sites , said staff at @entity12 told him his son would not live long with his condition , and needs urgent treatment at a more sophisticated medical facility			2
' the doctors said we should go to a private hospital and get surgery done , ' mr @entity80 said			0
' but i am a poor man			0
we can barely afford two square meals a day			0
i do n't know what to do			0
we are hoping that the government will help us , ' he added			0
' i have put everything at stake to save my child			0
we are feeling so helpless			0
we do n't know where to go , ' mr @entity80 went on to say			0
survivor : the fact this baby has lived into his sixth day means he has already beaten odds of less than one in a million			1
the condition affects only eight in every million births , with 90 per cent dying within three days the baby has now been shifted from @entity12 to a facility in the neighbouring city of @entity114			1
it is not yet known how much the operation will cost , and the child is likely to have to move hospitals again if the treatment is going to be carried out			0
mr and mrs @entity10 married four years ago , with the baby boy their first child .			0

*chance* of him surviving more than three days was less than one in a million

baby needs private healthcare as @entity12 is not able to operate
but his family live on less than £ 3 a day and can not afford to *pay* the fee
