@entity0 expects @entity2 's swimmers to be a future force after a post-london 2012 revival			1
@entity2 's most successful swimmer is now retired after winning two gold medals aged 19 at the @entity7 and two bronze medals four years later in @entity9			1
those third - placed finishes were part of a haul of just three @entity14 medals in the swimming pool in a disappointing display which @entity0 does not expect to be repeated in @entity17 in 2016			1
@entity18 said she expects a bright future for @entity14 swimmers after a poor showing at @entity22 the 25 - year - old from @entity24 , who recently married swimmer @entity26 , takes confidence from the haul of medals won at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
@entity0 said : ' it was amazing to see the guys swimming so well , being so happy			1
' these guys were n't just winning , they were n't just getting medals , they were posting world - class times			1
' a lot of people with the @entity30 were saying ' @entity38 are n't there , @entity39 are n't there '			2
' it did n't matter , because the times they were posting rivalled the rest of the world , so it 's going to be interesting going into the @entity45 next year and see how good these guys can be			2
' they are n't fazed who they stand up next to any more			2
they 're all their to be beaten			2
@entity0 won two bronze medals at the @entity22 to add to the two golds she won in @entity53 ' everyone in the pool has that attitude which is absolutely incredible			1
' the strength in depth is best illustrated in the men 's breaststroke events , where pre-race favourite and @entity22 silver medallist @entity62 was beaten to @entity30 200metres gold by fellow @entity64			1
@entity65 , the @entity30 and @entity67 100m champion , @entity68 and others are also ensuring competition is tight			0
@entity0 added : ' the depth is fantastic			1
men 's breaststroke is just insane			0
only two people can go to the @entity45			0
' when you 've got four guys in the top 10 in the world fighting for two places , they 're going to have to be on form and on target			0
@entity14 swimmers performed well at the @entity83 both in terms of medals and times ' they ca n't relax at the trials , which can only be good			1
' that 's what you 've got to do at the @entity45			0
you 've got to step up in the heats and semi-finals and post @entity93 ( personal best times ) just to make it through			0
' while enthusiastic about the improvement in @entity14 swimming , @entity0 does not yearn for a return to the water			1
' i do n't miss the competition element , ' she added			0
' i try to go in the pool as much as i can			0
it 's such a nice way to relax			0
it 's a nice way to think about your day and problem solve			0
it 's a nice time to get 30 minutes to yourself thinking , as well as doing something productive			0
' @entity0 was speaking at @entity110 at @entity111			2
@entity2 's most successful ever @entity113 swimmer says she has high hopes for @entity2 's chances at @entity116			0

@entity18 said she expects bright future for @entity14 swimmers
@entity14 swimmers disappointed at @entity22 , only winning three medals
but they performed well at @entity83
@entity0 says she expects them to perform well at @entity126
