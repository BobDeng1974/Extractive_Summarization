the cartoon - like face that was painted over a 19th century religious artwork is now popping up on some of the world 's most revered masterpieces - from @entity5 and child to the @entity7			1
@entity8 , 80 , painted her crude rendition of @entity11 's face over a crumbling fresco on the wall of a @entity15 church , and the altered version became an overnight sensation when pictures of her amateur ' restoration ' hit the internet			1
now her notorious @entity22 job has sparked a craze for copycat ' restorations ' , but art lovers can breathe a sigh of relief as the alterations have been mocked - up purely for comic purposes			0
jokers on the web also replaced the face of the baby in the @entity51 master 's @entity52 with the face from the fresco , and transformed @entity55 and all twelve of his apostles in @entity57			2
fans of the restored fresco also tinkered with more modern masterpieces , including @entity62 's @entity61 , which the expressionist artist worked on between 1893 and 1910			1

but since pictures of her handiwork made headlines around the world crowds have been queuing up at the church to have their photo taken with the artwork , and a @entity109 account set up under the name of @entity8 has over 4,000 followers			0
