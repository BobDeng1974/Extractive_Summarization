by @entity0 the @entity1 has revealed its latest 3d radar system which can track missiles - before knocking them out of the sky			2
the cutting - edge system , called ' @entity7 ' , was tested by some 180 sailors on board @entity9 off the coast of @entity11 today			1
it tracked a sea - skimming target , before launching a @entity15 missile - which crashed into the object seconds later			1
it tracked a target , before launching a @entity15 missle ( above ) - which crashed into the object seconds later the dramatic moment , caught on camera by crew members , was the first time the system had been used to track a moving target ahead of a missile launch			1
and it has been deemed a success - with experts saying the ' @entity7 ' system could be used by the @entity1 in the future to counter any threats in the skies			1
' i ’m pleased the team performed well and we achieved the firing quickly and efficiently , ' said lieutenant commander @entity41 , who directed the firing from the frigate ’s operations room			0
' it really boosted confidence in the new radar ahead of @entity9 ’s deployment			0
' new technology : the dramatic moment , caught on camera by crew members , was the first time the system had been used to track a moving target ahead of a missile launch			1
above , a sailor uses the 3d radar system frigate : and it has been deemed a success - with experts saying the ' @entity7 ' system could be used by the @entity1 in the future to counter any threats in the skies			1
above , @entity9 , where the tests were carried out today , sailors used the system to track the target , which was being dragged along the surface of the sea by a long tow wire attached to an aircraft			2
they then passed the data to the @entity15 missile to follow and shoot - before successfully blasting the object out of the sky with a direct hit , according to a @entity1 statement			2
the trial , which took place as the frigate made its way back to its home base in @entity84 , followed eight weeks of tough training in @entity86			0
' we had just finished eight hard weeks of training where we ’d used @entity15 in simulation mode to defend ourselves against hostile aircraft and missiles , ' said lt @entity92			0
blasting off : sailors launch @entity95 missiles off the deck of @entity9 using @entity7 - or 997 - software “ to cap off the training with a live shoot was hugely satisfying			0
' @entity9 is the first ship in @entity102 's fleet to have @entity7 - also known as 997 in the @entity1 - and has been testing the system around the @entity102 since completing a refit last year			2
the revamp also saw her receive the latest version of @entity15 – a missile which has protected @entity1 frigates from air attack for more than 30 years			2
lieutenant commander @entity111 , whose @entity114 ( @entity113 ) team is responsible for both @entity7 and the upgraded @entity15 , was also on board @entity9 for the successful shoot			0
' following a challenging trials and development programme , today was significant as it was the first time we have conducted a live firing with 997 , ' he said			0
' it was rewarding to see both the new radar and the upgraded weapon system operate together perfectly , successfully demonstrating end - to - end combat system performance , and validating a lot of hard work done by agencies across @entity129 and in industry			0
' at work : the system can track 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles away @entity7 is being fitted to the @entity1 ’s @entity136 frigates , as well as its two new aircraft carriers and assault ships @entity139 and @entity140			1
it could also be the principal air radar of the @entity143 combat ships , successor to the 23s , which enter service next decade			0
astonishingly , the system can track up to 800 targets simultaneously - and can even register objects 125 miles ( 200 kilometres ) away .			1

new system , called ' @entity7 ' , tested by sailors off coast of @entity11 today
it tracked sea - skimming target , before passing data to a @entity15 missile
missile was then launched into the air and blasted the object out of sky
first time system had been used to track target ahead of missile launch
it can track 800 objects simultaneously - even if they are 125 miles away
it has been deemed a success - and could be used by @entity1 in the future
