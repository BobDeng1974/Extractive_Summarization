@entity23 do : @entity3 , 26 , was spotted leaving a @entity13 hair salon with her hair chopped into a bob changes : while she was once derided for her glamorous looks , it is clear from the no - nonsense haircut and glasses that @entity31 is trying to adapt to being back to a low - key life in @entity13 changes : while she was once derided for her glamorous looks , it is clear from the no - nonsense haircut and glasses that @entity31 is trying to adapt to being back to a low - key life in @entity13 the new hairstyle comes in clear contrast to the hairstyle she has had for the past six years when the world was first introduced to her following the murder of her roommate @entity44 , who she lived with while studying abroad in @entity46 , @entity47 in 2007			1
her hair used to fall past her shoulder , but when she walked out of the downtown branch of @entity52 salons on wednesday , her hair was up to six inches shorter			0
haircuts at the salon , which boasts of being ' a slice of heaven ' , start at $ 50 and prices range depending on the experience level of the stylist			0
the salon is not far from @entity31 's apartment in the @entity60 of the city , but she may need some time to adjust to the new look as she quickly put on a hat once she left the salon			2
some getting used to : @entity31 quickly covered up with a knit cap though it did not appear to be for warmth as she kept her brown leather coat open and chest bare without a scarf dressed casually in faded jeans , blue clogs a striped sweater and brown leather jacket , it was clear that @entity31 was trying to blend into her new low - key life in @entity13			1
' face of an angel ' : @entity3 looked very different in 2008 when her trial first gained an international audience she looked like ever - the - student , wearing glasses and toting a large bag , that could have been headed to do work for her @entity89 classes that she enrolled in after returning to the @entity11 in the spring of last year			0
it has been a tense few weeks for @entity31 and she will surely be waiting on pins and needles until the verdict is handed down later this week about the latest round of appeals that the @entity97 trial has gone through			1
whatever is decided this week , the protracted legal battle that has grabbed global headlines and polarized trial - watchers in three nations probably wo n't end in @entity102			0
the first two trials produced flip - flop verdicts of guilty then innocent for @entity31 and her former @entity47 boyfriend , @entity105 , and the case has produced harshly clashing versions of events			1
a @entity102 appeals panel designated by @entity47 's supreme court to address issues it raised about the acquittal is set to deliberate thursday , with a verdict expected later in the day			2
much of the attention has focused on @entity31 , 26 , who has remained in @entity13 during this trial , citing her fear of ' the universal problem of wrongful conviction , ' according to her statement emailed to the @entity102 court			2
her representatives say she is concentrating on her studies at the @entity89			0
return : @entity31 returned to the @entity11 in march 2013 after her verdict was overturned , and now she may be sentenced again if the @entity47 court finds her guilty in the latest appeals case going on now return : @entity31 returned to the @entity11 in march 2013 after her verdict was overturned ( seen here on the @entity134 in september ) , and now she may be sentenced again if the @entity47 court finds her guilty in the latest appeals case going on now ' we wait for the verdict , and remain hopeful , ' @entity31 's @entity11 lawyer , @entity137 , said by telephone from @entity141			1
' but history being our guide , we know @entity3 can be convicted and it is very disconcerting to her and her family			0
the logical position is that there is no evidence			0
' @entity31 was arrested four days after @entity97 's half - naked body was discovered november 2 , 2007 in the @entity151 's bedroom in the university town of @entity46			0
