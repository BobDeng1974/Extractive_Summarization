by @entity0 amateur - sleuth : @entity2 arrives at the @entity4 premiere of ' @entity5 ' at the @entity6 on january 15 , 2009 in @entity4 , @entity8 - @entity7 has spent the past 25 - years investigating her daughter 's death while you may not have heard of author @entity2 or the tragic and unsolved murder of her 18 - year - old daughter in 1989 , you definitely know the 1997 cult movie , @entity11			1
written by @entity7 , 80 , in 1973 , the hit , starring @entity17 and @entity18 , spawned sequels and spoofs as the 90s most memorable horror film , along with @entity22			2
despite the success of her fiction , in reality , @entity7 has been battling for the past 25 - years to discover the truth behind her girl , @entity31 's death in @entity32 , @entity33 - a journey which has taken her to the doors of organized crime and a possible police cover - up			1
indeed , as life began to imitate art , @entity7 's dogged pursuit of the truth of her daughter 's murder began on the night of july 16th , 1989			1
her teenage daughter had just graduated high school and left a girlfriend 's house in her 1984 @entity51 at 10.45pm			0
@entity31 , who had just been accepted into the @entity53 to study medicine braked as she approached a railway crossing in @entity32 at around 10.45pm			1
suddenly she was shot twice , once through the temple and once through the cheek by a shooter who opened fire on the driver 's side of the vehicle			1
she was rushed to hospital , placed on life support and put into a medically induced coma			0
sadly , she died the next day and for the past quarter century , @entity7 has used all her amateur sleuth skills to decipher any possible suspects and motives related to the act			2
the official police investigation determined that the lethal assault was a random act of violence , perpetrated by drive - by shooters			0
@entity7 however , found evidence that suggested otherwise			2
murdered : @entity77 was shot dead at a railway crossing while she was sitting on the drivers side			1
two bullets hit her in the head capable student @entity31 was seeing @entity84 , a @entity85 immigrant at the time of her murder			1
ten years her older , @entity84 was one of his nation 's boat people - who fled the war torn nation after the @entity92 pulled out in 1975			1
he was dismissed as a suspect in the killing because his fingers tested negative for any gun residue			0
furthermore , the police found a letter from @entity31 in the apartment she lived in with @entity84 that said , ' hon , where are you ? i know you 're still mad			2
i 'm so sorry ok ! i miss you today			0
i went to the mom 's house to return these books			0
' because of this note the police ruled out fighting between the couple as a motive for her murder			0
but , five days later , @entity84 was discovered to have stabbed himself in the stomach in the middle of the night , in what he claimed was a suicide attempt			0
this raised the suspicions of @entity7 , who wondered why anyone would try and kill themselves so painfully by stabbing themselves in the midriff ? digging deeper , @entity7 found that @entity84 was part of a multi-million dollar insurance fraud in @entity8			1
the scam was to stage a car accidents with both parties involved to claim fraudulent insurance money			1
this was a burgeoning business among @entity85 immigrants in @entity8 and @entity84 would sometimes take @entity31 along with him when he carried out the fraud			2
promising student : @entity77 was preparing to study medicine at the @entity53 before her murder in 1989 this set her mind racing and she rushed to visit @entity84 in hospital , where he was recovering from his self - inflicted stabbing			2
@entity7 told @entity146 's @entity145 that while heavily sedated , @entity84 told her that he did n't kill @entity31 , but he was ' deciding ' whether he loved he enough to tell police who did			1
hiring private investigators and even psychic detectives to aid in her search , @entity7 then discovered that @entity32 police knew that @entity84 was involved in fraud and had decided not to investigate his association with @entity85 gangs			1
things became even more skewed when @entity7 was finally shown the note that @entity31 had written for @entity84			2
she was adamant that this was not her daughter 's handwriting and then , staggeringly , the case became even murkier			0
a close friend of @entity31 's told @entity164 that @entity84 phoned her on the night of the shooting screaming ' @entity167 's dead ! '			1
however , police did not travel to notify @entity84 of his girlfriend 's death until 3am - several hours after that panicked phone call			2
then , the case twisted even further when two men , @entity174 and @entity175 , 18 and 21 - years - old , were arrested and charged with the killing			1
police told @entity7 that the two men had randomly killed her daughter after one of the men bet the other to shoot @entity31 - and he did			1
@entity11 : the hit 1997 movie starred @entity185 , ( left ) @entity17 ( center left ) , @entity18 ( center right ) , @entity188 ( right ) and was based on @entity2 's 1973 bestseller however , despite the insistence of district attorney @entity192 that the two men were guilty , there was no evidence and no motive aside from random violence			0
a jury agreed and dismissed the charges against @entity174 and @entity198			0
@entity7 now feels that the police were inept and willfully incompetent in the case and missed a key detail discovered by private investigator , @entity203 years later			2
on the night of @entity31 's murder , the first detective to respond to the scene found a man called @entity208 standing by the car , who claimed to be just walking by			1
according to @entity211 , ' standard procedure would have required police to run @entity208 's name , ' which they did not			0
if they had they would have discovered that @entity208 had been charged with ' committing multiple violent attacks against women , including robbery and beating a young girl with a baseball bat			0
' his car matched the make and model , although not the color , of what eye - witnesses said was a car which dashed away from the scene			0
@entity7 became obsessed by the crime and returned frequently to psychics and private investigators to solve the murder of her daughter			1
she wrote two books , who killed my daughter ? and one to the @entity242 , about the killing			0
tragically there is no answer for @entity7			0
@entity145 asks , ' was there a relationship between @entity208 , the ' @entity85 connection ' and @entity198 and @entity174 ? had the crime scene been derailed by incompetence or by a cover - up ? had @entity167 stumbled onto something even more sinister than insurance fraud ? ' @entity7 herself believes that her daughter was targeted and police tried to cover their tracks after they discovered that @entity208 had not been stopped at the time			1
for their part , the @entity258 believe that @entity7 is becoming a hindrance to the still unsolved murder			0
' when she puts out stuff that ’s not factual , it ’s not helping the case , ' @entity262 said to @entity145 at @entity146			0
' @entity262 would not say which details were not factual , nor how they had ' compromised ” @entity269 ’s investigation , as he put it			0

author @entity2 , 80 , lost her daughter , @entity31 , on july 17 , 1989 in @entity32 , @entity33
@entity31 , 18 , was shot once in the temple and once in the cheek at a railway crossing
her murder has never been solved and @entity7 has devoted 25 - years of her life investigating the crime
@entity7 suspects that her daughter may have been murdered because of a multi-million dollar insurance scam
@entity31 's @entity85 *boyfriend* , who was ten years her senior was *allegedly* causing car accidents in fraudulent scam
@entity7 also believes the police failed to check on a potential suspect found near the scene
thinks they may have covered this up in the years afterwards
