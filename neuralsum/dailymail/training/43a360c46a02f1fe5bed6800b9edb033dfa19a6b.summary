by @entity1 reporter published : 09:55 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 29 august 2013 this is the moment an attention seeking cub annoyed his father once too often			1
the cheeky cub can be seen tugging on his father 's mane , chewing on his fur and even smacking him on the end of the nose in a bid to entice him to play			1
but while the father initially returned his son 's affections , he soon lost patience with the playful cub and snapped - baring his teeth at the startled cub			2
i warned you , boy ... @entity24 the lion makes it clear he has had enough of his son 's fun and games the images were taken by photographer @entity30 , 54 , at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34			1
he said : ' i 'm connected with a number of people at the zoo and they invited me to come along when the lion cubs were born			1
' having been an editorial photographer i like to create images which tell a story or send a message			2
' i spent a lot of time photographing the cubs , i went whenever i could			2
every time the cubs came out there was a question mark over what they would do			0
the cheeky cub can be seen tugging on his father 's mane , chewing on his fur and even smacking him on the end of the nose so much for my lie - in : @entity24 's nap is a no - no as far as the youngster is concerned seriously , son , take the hint : @entity24 looks like he is enjoying a cuddle ... but that out - stretched paw is getting ready to swipe ' when the adult male lion , @entity24 , is in the yard the cubs come out with the female lions			1
' interestingly many of the cubs head straight for dad , they 're like " hey dad look at me "			0
' the cubs would jump on @entity24 to try and get his attention , just being playful really			0
' but if @entity24 is grumpy he 'll roar and as he does the mother lion gives him a telling off			1
he 's a bit of a wimp compared to other lions so if he gets a telling off he 'll tolerate the cubs a little longer			0
' they would get five to ten minutes ' interaction with dad before he would get tired and there 'd be a roar			0
' and if one of the cubs would make the mistake of grabbing his tail , @entity24 would get really angry			0
' it 's really just nature in action			0
you annoy your dad that much , he 'll snap and be like " that 's enough "			0
' right , that 's it ! the cub takes a bite out of @entity24 's chin ... and he 's not happy about it fine , i 'll leave you alone ! the cub retreats to safety ... still with a look of mischief about it			1

the older lion sees the funny side at first ... but not for long !
