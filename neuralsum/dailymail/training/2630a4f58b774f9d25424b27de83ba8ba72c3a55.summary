by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 07:48 est , 26 march 2012 @entity1 : the company 's chief privacy officer says users should ' never ' have to give out passwords in job interviews two @entity8 senators are calling for an investigation into the practice of asking for @entity1 passwords in job interviews so that interviewers can ' look through ' accounts for information that might be concealed from the public			1
the practice , which has horrified privacy campaigners , could be against federal law			1
@entity1 itself has already said that the practice - which has been documented at several @entity8 organisations - is a violation of its terms of use and could potentially lead to legal action			1
@entity27 , a @entity28 senator for @entity29 , along with @entity30 , @entity28 senator for @entity31 are calling on the @entity32 and the @entity8 @entity33 to investigate the practice			1
@entity27 said , ' in an age where more and more of our personal information - and our private social interactions - are online , it is vital that all individuals be allowed to determine for themselves what personal information they want to make public and protect personal information from their would - be employers			1
this is especially important during the job - seeking process , when all the power is on one side of the fence , ' the practice is already highly controversial			1
the @entity51 who says that the practice is a clear violation of personal privacy			1
@entity1 's chief privacy officer , @entity56 , stepped in on friday in a post which said , ' if you are a @entity1 user , you should never have to share your password			2
' the social networking company says that it would even consider suing firms that use the practice			2
it also warns firms could open themselves up to legal challenges from job candidates			0
' we have worked really hard at @entity1 to give you the tools to control who sees your information , ' says @entity72			0
' that ’s why we ’ve made it a violation of @entity1 ’s @entity76 to share or solicit a @entity1 password			0
' job applicants at the @entity79 were asked to allow the interviewer to watch as the applicant logged into @entity1 and clicked through photos , messages , and wall posts that were behind the privacy wall			2
in a post on friday , @entity1 's chief privacy officer cautions that if an employer discovers that a job applicant is a member of a protected group , the employer may open itself up to claims of discrimination if it does n't hire that person			2
they say that while ‘ shoulder surfing ’ , as the practice is called , may technically be voluntary , the vast majority of applicants feel obligated to open up their lives to their employers or risk losing the job			2
sharing made very easy : employers are making job candidates list their password information for @entity1 and their email accounts on some applications and others are asking them to take them on a tour during the interview an extreme case was that of @entity115 , who had been working for the @entity32 for years before they asked him to give his email and @entity1 logins			1
‘ here i am , a us citizen who has n’t broken any laws , who has n’t committed any crimes , and here i am having a prospective - well , not prospective in my case - an employer , looking at my personal communications , my personal posts , my personal identifiable information , ’ he said in a video produced by the @entity51			2
others strongly request that the candidate opens their pages in front of them and allow their would - be bosses to scroll through their private information during the interview			0
outraged : @entity115 already worked at the @entity79 when they asked him to hand over all personal login information ‘ it ’s an absolute and total invasion and total overreach on their part , ’ mr @entity115 said			0
following his case , the @entity32 suspended the policy for 45 days before compromising on ‘ shoulder surfing ’ as an alternative			1
trouble maker : @entity146 posted about making very expensive purchases while still a student prompting an @entity150 investigation and changed school policies while the prospect of revealing the inner workings of your social life seems daunting , it has only lead to serious consequences in a few cases : of the 2,689 applicants that the @entity79 examined , only seven were denied the position based on items interviewers discovered behind privacy walls			1
in addition to creating an awkward situation for potential employers , it also forces them to break @entity1 policy			0
‘ you will not share your password ... let anyone else access your account or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account , ’ the site ’s policy stipulates			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity180 spoke with @entity181 and while he would not comment on the specific case of the @entity79 , he speculated that the practice was against the site ’s terms of service			0
‘ under our terms , only the holder of the email address and password is considered the @entity1 account owner			0
we also prohibit anyone from soliciting the login information or accessing an account belonging to someone else , ’ he told the news site			0
in an effort to avoid this situation , the @entity197 has instated a policy that forces student athletes to ‘ friend ’ at least one of their coaches so that they can constantly monitor what the students put online			0
that school ’s worries come from experience , as former football player @entity146 posted about making very expensive purchases while still a student			0
the post prompted an investigation by the @entity150 , and , in turn , the school ’s privacy policy .			1
