@entity0 are set to roar against @entity1 on saturday with @entity2 poised to recall three @entity3 to his starting line - up and add a fourth to the bench when he names his team on thursday			1
the @entity0 head coach will recall @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 to the starting xv , while @entity12 will be among the replacements			1
however , it appeared @entity2 was willing to wait on a wednesday night medical update ( and this morning ’s training session ) before making a final call on whether to include yet another 2013 @entity18 in @entity20 ’s @entity19			0
@entity9 is expected to return against @entity1 after a three - month absence with concussion @entity23 is another @entity24 player set to start against the @entity25 having comfortably seen off @entity27 in @entity28 , the @entity26 will be confident the inclusions of @entity9 , @entity11 and @entity10 from the start — with @entity12 as a replacement — can give a timely boost to @entity0 ’s @entity34 title defence			1
this saturday will be @entity9 ’s first match of any kind since @entity0 beat @entity38 12 weeks ago , the out - half getting stood down in the interim by a @entity25 neurologist and ordered to rest following repeated concussion			2
he will replace @entity42 , his @entity43 deputy , who slips out of the squad as @entity46 ’s greater versatility across the back line means he will again provide this weekend ’s no 10 bench cover			0
@entity11 , who had been nursing a shoulder problem since the start of january , was left out for the game in @entity28 despite being declared fit in the latter part of last week			2
@entity12 is set to be named among the replacements when @entity2 names team on thursday @entity11 is another @entity3 player to be recalled for @entity0 's game with @entity1 on saturday but he will now return to his familiar no 8 role at the expense of @entity58 after missing his first @entity34 match since 2011			1
the inclusion of @entity9 and @entity11 in today ’s 2pm team announcement at @entity62 will be no surprise , but @entity2 is willing to give @entity10 a second chance to play his first test since november 2013 following last saturday ’s aborted comeback in @entity27			1
@entity10 , who twice had shoulder reconstruction surgery in 2014 , had been chosen to start at @entity68 but pulled up lame in the pre-match warm - up with a tight hamstring , an 11th - hour development that resulted in @entity2 hurriedly promoting replacement @entity72 to the starting line - up			2
@entity19 ( centre ) was taken off during the 26 - 3 victory over @entity27 with concussion on saturday afternoon like his @entity79 team - mate @entity42 , @entity72 has dropped from the starting xv in @entity28 out of the matchday squad entirely			0
@entity12 , who trained fully on february 3 for the first time in 17 weeks following hamstring surgery , is poised to feature in his first test since the title win in @entity86 last march — the loosehead taking over from @entity88 in the replacements			0
and he may yet be joined on the bench by @entity19			0
the @entity20 hooker has not trained fully since suffering a concussion in @entity28 last saturday and must prove his readiness if he is to keep back - up @entity94 out of the no 2 shirt			0
the @entity0 players celebrate a try during the opening @entity34 fixture win in @entity27 last weekend meanwhile , @entity1 have made just one change from the side that laboured to a dull opening - round victory over @entity104 last saturday			1
head coach @entity105 has replaced injured loosehead @entity106 with @entity107 , @entity9 ’s @entity108 team - mate at @entity109			2
@entity110 comes onto the bench , where he will likely be used as a late impact substitute .			0

@entity0 play @entity1 in second round of @entity34 matches on saturday
head coach @entity2 will announce his team on thursday
@entity26 is set to recall four @entity24 to the squad
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will start the match
while @entity12 will take his place among the replacements
