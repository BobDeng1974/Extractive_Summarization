by @entity0 after nearly 400 years of symbolising four nations united in one flag , what would the @entity3 look like without the blue and white of the @entity5 ? the question is being posed by flag experts after a poll found nearly 65 per cent were in favour of changing the flag if @entity12 votes yes to independence			2
the vexillologists , as they are known , have come up with designs that could replace the familiar red , white and blue flag			1
the first design strips out the blue field of the @entity12 flag , replacing it with black , and sees the white bands turn a shade of yellow - intended to honour the flag of @entity25 ' patron saint , @entity24 ( a yellow cross on a black field ) this version removes the white of @entity31 's saltire and imposes a crown and @entity33 - including @entity35 's three lions , the red @entity12 lion and the harp , a national symbol of @entity25 as well as @entity39 most have removed any trace of @entity12 blue , instead bringing in colours symbolic of @entity25 – both the striking yellow and black from the flag of @entity24 and the red dragon from the @entity25 national flag			1
but some designs retain elements of @entity12 , such as the red @entity12 lion or the thistle , which could be justified if the @entity50 remains head of state following independence , as @entity53 has stated			1
the yellow fimbriation is simply adding the gold cross of the @entity57 flag to the existing union flag all traces of @entity12 blue are removed , with the green from the @entity25 national flag fused into the bottom half , leaving the crosses of @entity63 and @entity64 last month , the @entity65 said the @entity3 would not be affected by the referendum because the @entity50 would remain the head of state			1
but the @entity68 , the @entity69 charity that advises on flags , has raised the question of a new flag for a @entity73 without @entity12			0
in a poll , 72 per cent wanted @entity25 to be represented in the design			0
a more modern interpretation of the design , including the colours of @entity24 's flag and retaining the @entity12 blue - to reflect the fact that @entity12 would continue to share the @entity69 monarchy this design removes the @entity12 elements from the flag entirely , and adds the @entity85 , surrounded by a garland of items symbolic of the @entity89 nations the red cross of @entity63 and blue and white @entity5 merged in 1606 , with a redesign to incorporate the @entity93 cross of @entity64 in 1801			1
@entity68 chief executive @entity68 said : ‘ there is already a precedent for changing the flag			0
’ all traces of @entity12 blue are removed , with the green from the @entity25 national flag fused into the bottom half , leaving the crosses of @entity63 and @entity64			1
the @entity3 keeps its shape but in comes a stark black background			0
the @entity12 influence , denoted by the blue of the @entity5 , is no longer welcome			0
a complete redesign , with no trace of @entity12 in the new @entity69 symbol but with the flags of @entity35 , @entity25 and @entity111 all squashed together in a row			2
two of the quadrants are filled with the @entity63 cross and one of the @entity25 flag			0
but in the bottom left hand corner , the @entity64 's cross is replaced the colours of the flag of @entity122 here , the flags of @entity35 , @entity25 and @entity111 are squashed in a row , with no trace of the @entity12 flag again , all trace of the @entity12 saltire has gone , leaving the red cross of @entity63 , the red saltire of @entity64 plus the @entity25 flag stuck on the bottom right hand corner the blue of @entity12 is replaced with black , and the national plants of the @entity69 – a rose , a daffodil and a shamrock – are added , plus a thistle for @entity12 who vote no. it is a standard design in royal banners to quarter the flags and have different designs in each quadrant			1
the @entity25 national flag is prominent but @entity35 ’s appears twice			0
the minimal change option , with the blue of the @entity5 retained but with a little yellow added to the cross to incorporate a symbol of @entity25			0
keeping the traditonal design in mind , this version swaps the @entity12 blue for a plain black from flag of @entity24 the more detailed design adds the national plants of the @entity69 a rose , a daffodil , and a shamrock			2
though the @entity12 blue has been replaced with the yellow and black of the @entity25 flag of @entity24 , there is still room for a thistle to represent those @entity12 who intend to vote no all @entity12 elements are removed , with blue changed to black and the addition of the royal coat of arms and a garland of items symbolic of the @entity89			1
@entity12 is removed completely , leaving the crosses of @entity63 and @entity64 , but with the addition of the @entity25 dragon			2
does it give @entity25 too much prominence ? the blue and white of the @entity5 are replaced by yellow and black to represent the flag of @entity24 , patron saint of @entity25			2
this gives the flag a @entity186 feel			0
this funky redesign of the @entity3 remains inclusive , finding room for the blue from the @entity5 and also the yellow and black of the flag of @entity24 representing @entity25			0
the white of the @entity5 is removed , while the main centre panel incorporates the @entity193 and @entity33 with @entity35 ’s three lions , a @entity25 harp and the @entity12 lion .			1

vexillologists have designed replacements for familiar red , white and blue
most remove @entity12 blue , instead bringing in colours symbolic of @entity25
but some designs retain elements of @entity12 - @entity12 lion or the thistle
