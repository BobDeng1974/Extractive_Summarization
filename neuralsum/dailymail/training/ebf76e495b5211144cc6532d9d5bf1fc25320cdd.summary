nice - looking in a watery way , @entity0 , whom i used to see 40 years ago at @entity2 , has always had a line in softly - spoken kings and princes			1
his voice a lovely , elegiac murmur , he is a particularly skilled exponent of @entity10			2
so , why is n’t he better known ? perhaps an implicit theme underlying @entity12 is the difference between conscientious , hardworking professionals and an acclaimed genius			2
how come some actors and actresses are household names while others , despite their quality and elegance , are only allowed to be considered very good , appreciated by the cognoscenti ? it is so unfair , because the gulf between the great and the competent — and the rewards that come their way — is vast			2
is it to do with the likes of @entity29 or @entity30 possessing a powerful and distinctive ego ? @entity0 and @entity32 together in ' @entity33 ' , october 2000 it ca n’t be because of variety and depth — otherwise @entity37 or @entity38 would be given a @entity40 memorial service when they eventually croak			1
whatever the answer , one thing is for certain : stardom is ‘ where the money is			2
that ’s the reality ’			2
being an actor , according to this highly intelligent book , is a struggle , unless you are in the @entity52 or sir @entity54 class			1
@entity0 — who appeared in 30 productions during his three years at @entity56 and served his apprenticeship carrying a spear at the @entity59 , where the leading lights were @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 — after all this time still has to travel on public transport , where he goes unrecognised			1
for most actors , and @entity0 is no different , the day is spent waiting for the phone to ring			1
unless you ’re @entity70 or @entity71 , being unemployed takes up a lot of energy			0
‘ you try to keep up a social life , ’ he says , ‘ though you ’d rather hibernate like a wounded animal			0
’ auditions — where it is necessary to put up , uncomplainingly , with the caprices of casting directors who will switch timetables and venues at the last minute — are a regular humiliation			0
a theatre company is ‘ an eccentric human machine ’ , the cast quickly forming ‘ instinctive antagonisms and silent grudges ’			0
dressing rooms are commonly poky and decent digs eat into the wage packet			1
tours play havoc with family life			0
loneliness and affairs are occupational hazards			0
‘ it can make you feel guiltily confused , ’ says @entity0 , philosophically			1
he writes evocatively of the ‘ nauseated fear ’ of first nights and the melancholia of last nights when , within hours , the set is dismantled , people disperse and an entire production is ‘ gone beyond recovery ’			0
forty years ago , the actors cost half the production budget on television			1
now , the performers ’ pay accounts for a mere 15 per cent			0
the money goes on computer effects			0
though a regular on a soap can earn £ 100,000 a year , a guest artiste , such as @entity0 , has to settle for £ 600 per episode before stoppages — if your agent demands more , ‘ you wo n’t be back next year ’			1
@entity0 describes the soap studio atmosphere brilliantly			1
one actor , ‘ after three years as a regular ’ on @entity129 , fully believed himself to be a surgeon , and thought the set at @entity127 was a genuine @entity128			1
scripts are shredded each night , because of ‘ a paranoid fear of press leaks ’			1
feature films are more of the same , on a bigger scale			0
the set - ups and endless takes make for extreme tedium			1
the stars are kept in seclusion			0
‘ they certainly wo n’t have their name on any trailer door			0
’ and not for your @entity141 or your @entity143 any ‘ evil - looking toilets and bacon rolls ’			2
they have suites and personal caterers			0
all in all , @entity0 paints a thoroughly bleak picture of a player ’s life , whether one is ‘ on the road , squatting in semi-derelict houses to play @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 ’ , or being told by @entity158 to be ‘ louder , softer , slower , or faster ’			1
gone are the days of boozy carousing , which prevailed for @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , or @entity163 , when it was a tradition to play @entity164 with a bottle of wine inside you			0
is anyone better off for the sparkling water culture ? @entity171 , it seems , is still a place rife with ‘ mendacity , broken promises and abandoned hope ’			0
and just as writing and literature have been obliterated by bloggers and the illiteracies and short attention span of texting and tweeting , acting is being eclipsed by ‘ reality ’ television ( i.e. members of the public who do n’t have to be paid ) , or else actors have been replaced altogether with digital puppets and animation			2
the day of the actor may even be done .			2
