people in five areas of the @entity2 will now have to dial the full area code to telephone local homes and businesses – as regulators claim we are running out of landline numbers			1
the change , which came into effect on wednesday , covers @entity11 ( 01224 ) , @entity12 ( 01274 ) , @entity13 ( 01273 ) , @entity14 ( 01642 ) and @entity15 ( 01908 )			0
it means that people calling a local number must also include the area code when dialling – just as if they were using a mobile phone			1
the move , implemented by the telecoms watchdog @entity25 , is designed to create nearly one million new numbers for these locations			1
an @entity25 spokesman said the move is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers , and that the changes can be adopted easily			1
call costs will not be affected			0
@entity25 is also planning to implement the same system in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 from some point after 2016 with contingency plans in place for a further 20 cities to follow suit			2
among the many other locations under the spotlight are @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
the industry regulator insists the shift is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers , however research by the organisation suggests the public are sceptical about this claim			2
the shift in telephone use towards mobile phones and calls made over the internet through services such as @entity65 suggests the demand for new landline numbers should be falling			1
there is also some resistance to the fact that the change means people will need to dial an 11 digit number to reach a local take - away or family member			0
separately , it creates extra costs for small businesses and traders , who need to change letter heads and signs to show the full number , including the national code			1
@entity13 , above , is just one of five areas that will see a change in how people call local numbers currently , @entity25 can not allocate local phone numbers where the first digit is 0 or 1			2
this is because the network computers may confuse the number with other existing dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use			0
for example , the system would recognise 07 as a mobile number , 08 as a special rate , or 118 as directory enquiries			0
once consumers are required to use the national code , thousands of new numbers beginning 0 or 1 can be offered to families or businesses			2
@entity25 insisted the changes can be adopted without too much inconvenience			2
it gives the example of @entity107 , which adopted the new system in 2012			0
the number of communications providers has increased significantly over the last ten years , leading to more competition and cheaper landline bills for millions of homes and businesses			0
but it has also led to increased pressure on the supply of new phone numbers			0
a spokesman said : ‘ requiring landline callers to use the code locally is intended to safeguard the future supply of new landline numbers and avoid the need for more disruptive measures , such as changing existing phone numbers			1
‘ the supply of new landline numbers also ensures that consumers and businesses continue to enjoy the widest choice of telecoms providers			1
‘ the cost of calls will not be affected , and those who dial without the area code after the change will hear a recorded message asking them to include it			1
‘ the measure was first implemented in @entity107 , @entity140 and @entity141 ( the 01202 code area ) in november 2012 and the process ran smoothly			0
