a group of 47 @entity2 senators warned @entity4 's mullahs on monday that any agreement the @entity7 administration strikes with the @entity9 republic to limit @entity11 's nuclear program may be short - lived unless @entity12 formally approves it			1
in a rare open letter to @entity4 leaders , @entity14 freshman sen. @entity13 and 46 others from the @entity2 wrote that without congressional approval , ' we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the @entity12 as nothing more than an executive agreement between president @entity7 and @entity25			1
' ' the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen , ' the @entity2 wrote , ' and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time			1
' the @entity34 in turn tried to brand @entity2 as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a ' partisan strategy to undermine the president ' while demanding power that goes against the role the @entity40 envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs			1
scroll down to read the letter freshman sen. @entity13 of @entity14 , shown in january at the @entity45 @entity44 , organized 47 @entity2 senators to warn @entity4 that a nuclear agreement could be short - lived unless @entity12 approves it the @entity34 in turn tried to brand @entity2 as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a ' partisan strategy to undermine the president ' while demanding authority that goes against the role the @entity40 envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs secretary of state @entity54 ( third from left ) met with @entity4 foreign minister @entity55 ( third from right ) for a new round of nuclear negotiations last wek while @entity60 prime minister @entity59 was in @entity61 telling @entity12 that @entity11 ca n't be trusted ' the rush to war , or at least the to the military option that many @entity2 are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the @entity45 , ' @entity34 spokesman @entity62 said monday afternoon			1
@entity62 speculated that letter emanated from @entity69 @entity2 ' concern that as soon as a deal is signed , the @entity34 would begin pressuring @entity12 to begin lifting sanctions			1
the @entity34 would first want to see ' demonstrated compliance ' on the part of @entity4 before that would ever happen , the president 's spokesman said			1
' the president does not envision substantial sanctions relief for @entity4 right at the negotiating table			2
' it will not even be weeks or months before such a conversation would take place , he explained			0
' i 'm talking about years			0
' the single - page letter at no point makes reference to sanctions - or war , for that matter			2
republicans and @entity92 alike have said they would like to see a stricter sanctions regime enforced if @entity4 does not agree to the @entity45 ' terms by the end of the month , and a resolution to that effect is set to come to the floor of the @entity69			1
that legislation would not authorize the president to go to war with @entity4 , though still , @entity62 contended that letter signers have no alternative to president @entity7 's diplomatic strategy other than ' a military option			1
' ' if they want to mask it as part of some sort of civics lesson that they want to share with @entity4 's political leadership , they 're welcome to do that , ' he said			2
' it might evince some reluctance or at least hesitations about the wisdom of their strategy , or at least the wisdom of their ultimate goal here , ' he charged			0
he added : ' the efforts of neoconservatives in the previous administration to do that frankly hurt the country 's standing around the world			0
' speaking to reporters after a meeting in the @entity134 with @entity136 president @entity135 , @entity7 commented that it 's ' somewhat ironic ' that @entity2 want to align themselves with ' hardliners ' in @entity4			1
' it 's an unusual coalition , ' he said			2
@entity141 notice : the letter to @entity4 's supreme leader @entity25 ( pictured ) warns that senators who signed it will be in office long after president @entity7 leaves the @entity34 later in the briefing he brought up an authorization for the @entity150 agreement the @entity34 sent to @entity12 last month asking for the power to fight @entity152 with ground troops in special circumstances			1
some @entity2 complained that the legislative language would bind the president too tightly because it strictly prohibited an ' enduring ' deployment of @entity45 forces			2
' we see a @entity2 that is eager to ...			0
direct almost unlimited authority to the @entity161 to wage war , but to try to repeatedly tie his hands when he is trying to conduct diplomacy , ' @entity62 claimed			0
the president would rather use @entity45 's influence to try to build coalitions around the world , not only because he thinks it is ' more effective , ' @entity62 said , but because it ' has yielded important results for the @entity45 people			1
' he cited the global coalition to destroy @entity152 as an example			0
' there is a starkly different approach between the one that is advocated by republicans that puts the military option and war - fighting at the top of the list , ' he continued			1
' that is not an approach that the vast majority of the @entity45 public support , and it 's certainly not an approach that our recent history indicates is the best way to protect @entity45 national security interests			0
' the @entity45 and other nations are seeking a pact that would let @entity194 powers verify that @entity4 will not obtain a nuclear weapon			2
although the letter , first reported by @entity198 , is addressed to ' leaders of the @entity200 of @entity4 , ' it 's equally aimed at delivering a message to @entity7			1
' the president may serve only two 4 - year terms , whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6 - year terms , ' @entity13 's group wrote			1
' as applied today , for instance , president @entity7 will leave office in january 2017 , while most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades			2
' @entity13 told @entity198 that ' @entity4 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril			1
' @entity219 sen. @entity218 said monday after that she was ' appalled ' at the @entity2 effort to ' blow up a major effort by our country and the world powers to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the @entity4 nuclear program			1
' ' this is a highly inappropriate and unprecedented incursion into the president ’s prerogative to conduct foreign affairs , ' she said			0
' this letter only serves one purpose — to destroy an ongoing negotiation to reach a diplomatic agreement in its closing days			0
' the @entity34 said monday that the @entity2 senators 's move ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing negotiations			1
their effort to ' essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful , ' @entity62 said , and is not ' the role our @entity40 envisioned @entity12 for to play when it comes to foreign affairs			0
' he told reporters the letter raises ' legitimate ' questions about the ' intent ' of @entity2 lawmakers			0
in remarks on the @entity69 floor monday afternoon top - ranking democrat @entity251 said the judgment of the chamber 's @entity2 ' seems to be clouded by their abhorrence of president @entity7			1
' @entity251 , who was the @entity69 's majority leader until january , when @entity2 rose to power , said the letter signers were ' undermining ' @entity7 ' while empowering the @entity260			1
' ' it is unprecedented for one political party to directly intervene in an international negotiation , with the sole goal of embarrassing the president , ' he stated			0
' we as leaders should do everything we can to ensure these negotiations have a chance to succeed			0
when it comes to preventing @entity4 from obtaining a nuclear bomb , we should put partisanship aside			0
' @entity251 said that most @entity92 disagreed with president @entity275 ’s foreign policy , but they never even ' considered ' sending a letter to @entity277 because ' it would have been an embarrassment			0
' ' obviously republicans do n’t know how to do anything other than attempt these seemingly juvenile political attacks against the president , ' he said , attacking his successor , @entity285 's ability to govern			2
the uranium enrichment facility in @entity287 , @entity4 is a major sticking point with the @entity45 , which wants inspectors to have unfettered access to the @entity4 regime 's nuclear program ' the greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant @entity9 with nuclear weapons , ' @entity60 @entity293 minister @entity59 warned @entity12 last tuesday @entity60 prime minister @entity59 addressed a joint meeting of @entity12 last week in @entity61			1
' the greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant @entity9 with nuclear weapons , ' he warned lawmakers			0
republicans and some @entity92 want @entity12 to have a vote on any agreement			0
the pact the bargainers are working on does not actually require congressional approval , however , because it is not a treaty , which would require a two - thirds majority @entity69 vote to be ratified			1
last week senate majority leader @entity285 , a @entity312 @entity2 , postponed action on legislation that would give @entity12 a vote on any deal that emerges			0
he delayed the measure in the face of solid @entity320 opposition to moving ahead on the bill now , just weeks before an end - of - march deadline for negotiators to produce an outline of an agreement			0
on @entity327 ' ' face the @entity328 ' sunday , @entity326 said the president would need congressional approval to lift sanctions already imposed on @entity11 because of its nuclear program			2
' i think he can not work around @entity12 forever , ' @entity326 said			0
@entity7 said in a separate @entity327 interview that the @entity45 would ' walk away ' from the talks unless they produce a procedure for verifying that restrictions on @entity4 's nuclear effort are working			1
the letter released monday was signed by 47 of the @entity69 's 54 republicans			1
included were @entity326 and the rest of the @entity69 @entity2 plus presidential contenders @entity345 of @entity346 , @entity347 of @entity312 and @entity348 of @entity349			2
the next negotiations are scheduled for march 15 , and wide gaps remain between the two sides			0
@entity4 has said its nuclear program is peaceful and is aimed at producing energy			0
the @entity355 found no discussion of the letter in @entity4 media , and @entity4 's regime had no immediate response to it			2
@entity13 serves on the @entity69 's @entity362 committees			1
he said monday morning on the @entity363 that @entity4 is a bigger threat to the @entity45 than the @entity152 terror army operating in @entity366 and @entity367			2
he also said he would like to see some @entity92 sign on to his letter			0
' i 'd encourage @entity370 to join us , ' he said			0

@entity7 commented that it 's ' somewhat ironic ' that @entity2 want to align themselves with ' hardliners ' in @entity4 . ' it 's an unusual coalition '

president @entity7 's successor ' could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen , ' the letter read
