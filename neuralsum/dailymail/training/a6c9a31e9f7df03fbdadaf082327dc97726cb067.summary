by @entity0 for the @entity1 changing tide ? @entity3 claims ' the rising tide of anti-european sentiment ' is leading to an emphasis on @entity8 law rather than the @entity10 convention courts are increasingly basing their verdicts on @entity8 law rather than @entity10 human rights legislation as the ' empire strikes back ' , according to the country 's top woman judge			1
@entity3 suggested the move may be a response to ' the rising tide of @entity22 sentiment among parliamentarians , the press and the public '			1
in recent years , a string of controversial verdicts have been handed down which cited the @entity28 , which was enshrined into @entity8 law by @entity31 's @entity30			1
commonly , criminals and others have won victories based on the likes of article 8 â€“ the right to a family and private life			0
but @entity3 said that ' renewed emphasis ' was now being placed on @entity8 constitutional principles as a source of rights and obligations , rather than @entity10 legislation			1
the deputy president of the @entity47 said that @entity8 constitutionalism is ' on the march '			1
in a lecture to lawyers , @entity3 said : ' after more than a decade of concentrating on @entity10 instruments as the source of rights , remedies and obligations , there is emerging a renewed emphasis on the common law and distinctively @entity8 constitutional principles as a source of legal inspiration			1
' it seems to me to take us in some interesting directions			0
' @entity3 said the theme had been characterised as ' the empire strikes back ' but she preferred to ' broaden ' it into ' @entity8 constitutionalism on the march '			1
she said that inside the @entity47 there was a ' growing awareness of the extent to which the @entity8 's constitutional principles should be at the forefront of the court 's analysis '			0
@entity3 added that litigants and litigators had been reminded that they should look ' first to the common law to protect their fundamental rights '			2
she said she would leave it to others to decide whether the trend was developing ' as a response to the rising tide of @entity22 sentiment among parliamentarians , the press and the public ' or whether whether a marker was being put down for what might happen if the @entity30 was repealed			0
the @entity93 are expected to propose scrapping the legislation in in their manifesto for next year 's election			0
this might mean the courts would have to turn to other laws instead to give protection to the public			0
@entity102 strikes back : she said that judges are increasingly aware that @entity8 principals should be emphasised an alternative , she said , was the courts were expressing ' simple irritation that our proud traditions of @entity8 constitutionalism seemed to have been forgotten '			2
earlier this month , @entity112 , president of the @entity47 - and the @entity8 's most senior judge - said @entity8 judges might sometimes have been ' too ready ' to follow decisions made by the @entity116			2
@entity112 said judges were beginning to see that such an approach might not be appropriate			0
he said one of the most controversial aspects of the @entity28 was that it was an international set of rules with the @entity116 - based in @entity122 , @entity123 - as ' its final arbiter ' .			0

top judge @entity3 said there is ' renewed emphasis ' on @entity8 law
suggested move may be response to rising @entity133 sentiments
