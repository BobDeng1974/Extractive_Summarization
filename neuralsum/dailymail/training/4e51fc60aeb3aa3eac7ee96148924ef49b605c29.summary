by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 16 december 2012 telling it straight : @entity2 speaks out about his tumour he has made a name for himself as @entity6 ’s least graceful loser			1
@entity2 ’s rant on @entity8 ( he described his co-contestants as ‘ idiots ’ before adding : ‘ i hope they , their loved ones and all their pets die horribly in freak yachting accidents ! ’ ) earned him cult status			1
he later joined the experts panel on another hit @entity19 quiz show , @entity20 , and wrote a book called how to win tv @entity22			1
despite his straight - talking , it is perhaps ironic that illness once threatened to silence him			1
@entity27 ’s problems began in 1998 when he noticed a small swelling on the left - hand side of the roof of his mouth			1
he did n’t visit his doctor because he assumed it was a harmless ulcer			1
but eight months later , it was obstructing his speech and preventing him from eating properly			2
‘ i was a typical male about the situation – i was scared and i did n’t want to admit i might be ill , ’ says @entity27 , 43			2
‘ i did n’t even dare look at it in a mirror until it started to press on my tongue			2
’ two months later , the obstruction had swollen further , so @entity27 went to the @entity43 department at @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46			2
‘ i remember sitting in the waiting room for hours , wondering what the hell it could be			2
i ’ve never drunk , never smoked and i ’m a vegetarian , ’ he says			2
‘ i was utterly terrified			2
’ within seconds of examining the growth , the doctor ordered a biopsy			0
@entity27 was kept in overnight for monitoring , and by the morning doctors had the results for him			0
‘ the doctor asked if i wanted the good news or the bad news – naturally i opted for the former , ’ he remembers			0
‘ he told me it was n’t cancer			0
’ the bad news was that he would need the lump removed immediately and that not only was the procedure risky , it would require him being conscious throughout the operation			1
‘ the thought of having to be awake during my own procedure made me feel sick , especially after i heard what the surgery would entail , ’ he says			0
the benign growth had originated in @entity27 ’s nasal cavity and as it had grown , it had pushed through the bony palate ( roof of the mouth ) , which is made of cartilage			1
at the time he believed it was the size of a pea , but it was closer to the size of a golf ball at this stage because , like an iceberg , the bulk of it was hidden			1
to remove it , surgeons peeled back the skin on the roof of the mouth and sliced a hole 1½ in in diameter into the bony palate to tease out the tumour			1
the procedure took two hours			0
quiz king : @entity2 , second from left , appearing on @entity19 's quiz show @entity20 remarkably , @entity27 – real name @entity2 – was able to go home the same day and he claims the pain was hardly noticeable			1
‘ it was no worse than the dull throbbing that the lump had caused in the first place			1
anyway , i was so relieved it was n’t cancer , i overlooked any discomfort			0
’ the surgery , however , did not involve filling the hole			0
@entity27 was advised to chew on the right side of his mouth and drink through a straw , and eventually , the cartilage and skin would grow back			1
however , it would take eight years before it was fully healed			0
‘ nowadays , someone who had this procedure would be offered a variety of solutions to close up the hole , such as a prosthetic palate , ’ says @entity113 , consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the @entity115 in @entity46			0
mr @entity113 warns people not to ignore growths because there can be disastrous consequences			0
‘ these tumours are often harmless but 50 per cent will not be – ignoring one is a risk not worth taking			0
’ today @entity27 , who has moved from appearing in quiz shows into acting – he recently starred in a stage version of the thriller deathtrap – remains spooked by his own incident			0
‘ my advice to anyone with any sort of abnormal growth is to get it checked out immediately , even if you ’re scared , ’ he says .			0

@entity20 ' @entity2 's horror when he discovered a lump in his mouth
what appeared to be a pea - sized cyst was a tumor the size of a golf ball
