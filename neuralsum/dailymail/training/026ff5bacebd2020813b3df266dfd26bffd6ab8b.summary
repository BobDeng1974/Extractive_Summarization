the youngster ’s care was shared between her family ’s local district general hospital , @entity46 in @entity47 , cancer specialists at the @entity49 , in @entity50 , west @entity38 , and a neurosurgical team at @entity52 , south @entity38			1
dr @entity13 accepted there ' have been improvements in the main , ' at the hospitals but added : ' what i continue to have concerns about is the ability of the consultants to effectively lead their teams			0
' before bringing the inquest to a close , dr @entity13 turned to @entity23 's parents @entity64 and @entity66 and said : ' i am very very sorry that you had to endure this and it has gone on for such a long time			1
' you had @entity23 taken away from you in such a circumstance that was hasty			0
a parent i think you would want to be in a position where they can look after their children right the way through to the end			0
' i am sorry and you have my sincere condolences			0
' illness : the inquest heard there had been failures ' at almost every pathway , ' including unclear information about @entity23 's @entity84 , inadequate communication and lack of overall care plan the inquest heard that professor @entity89 , medical director of the @entity49 , who led an inquiry into @entity23 ’s care at the hospital and @entity46 following her death , found more than a dozen failings by medical staff			1
dr @entity13 said the report had shown failures at ' almost every pathway ' of care given to the toddler including unclear information about her mri scan , inadequate communication , lack of overall care plan , lack of monitoring of her hydrocephalus - or ' water on the brain ' - and a failure to listen to @entity23 ’s parents			1
prof @entity89 told the inquest @entity23 ’s death had ' shaken many , many people within the organisation '			2
' i do n’t think anyone involved in this case will forget it , ' he said			0
' i certainly wo n’t			0
' the inquest heard that @entity23 's parents were told at the @entity49 on march 23 , 2011 that an mri scan had shown some signs of fluid accumulation and that their daughter should be taken to @entity46 if her symptoms worsened for a ct scan			1
but by the time tests were carried out , @entity23 had suffered irreversible brain damage and emergency surgery could not save her			0
responsible : @entity23 's care was split between @entity46 in south @entity38 , pictured , the @entity49 in @entity50 and @entity52 in south @entity38 lawyers for the family claimed there were also further delays in transferring @entity23 to @entity52 and in the surgery taking place			1
@entity23 ’s parents @entity136 and mrs @entity9 hugged after the coroner delivered his verdict			1
in a statement after the inquest , they said : ' our daughter ’s death at two years of age , which the coroner has today described as ‘ avoidable ’ , has devastated us			0
' she died in pain whilst under the care of medical professionals in whom we had placed our trust and who we were forced to beg to get her the help she needed			0
' expert evidence has made clear that if the doctors had done what they should , @entity23 would be with us today			0
' the inquest has clearly shown that despite @entity23 being under the ‘ shared care ’ of three hospitals , these hospitals did not work together as they should			2
' we are grateful that the inquest into @entity9 ’s death has at last allowed us to hear from the medical staff involved in @entity23 ’s care and heard how an abject failure of leadership led to our daughter ’s untimely death			1
' the evidence has been shocking and should cause concern for all those who are patients of shared care systems across the @entity173			0
action : @entity64 and @entity66 , pictured , will ' continue to pursue legal action against those involved ' their lawyer @entity177 has said ' we would like to know what has been done and being done to ensure nothing like this ever happens to another family			0
' we hope the serious concerns the coroner will now communicate to all parties , including the @entity40 and @entity38 , will lead to a real change in the way care is provided to children in @entity38 and across the @entity173			2
' the @entity66 family , based in south west @entity38 , will ' continue to pursue legal action against those involved , ' according to their lawyer @entity177			1
she said : ' the evidence the coroner heard at the inquest has confirmed the numerous failings in @entity23 ’s care			2
the lack of responsibility taken by the consultants and the complete lack of communication of vital information about @entity23 ’s condition between and within teams was just astonishing			0
' the @entity49 said in a statement : ' the @entity49 carried out both its own internal investigation and a joint investigation with @entity208 and @entity52 ’s hospitals into the circumstances surrounding @entity9 ’s death			1
' a comprehensive action plan has been put in place to address the issues raised in these inquiries			0
we are constantly reviewing our systems and processes and will continue to do so in light of the coroner ’s findings			0
