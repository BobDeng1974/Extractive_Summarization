by @entity0 and @entity1 support for @entity3 has crumbled in the ‎ wake of its @entity6 election victory , a new opinion poll suggests today			1
the party has fallen back to single figures to be on nine per cent , down seven points from 16 per cent last month			0
@entity12 ’s party has failed to advance since it became ‎ the first party other than @entity14 or the @entity15 to come first in a @entity17 national election in modern political history in may			1
according to the @entity36 / @entity35 poll , @entity3 has gone into reverse with the @entity15 gaining the most of the defectors , up three points to 34 percent			1
@entity14 gained one point to to 33 per cent and the @entity42 went up two to 12 per cent			2
the party ’s advance started to flounder weeks after its @entity6 election win when it failed to take the @entity46 by - election			1
the seat was held by the @entity15 in june			0
but the poll also shows that support for the @entity21 and @entity14 parties - who are separated by just one point - is almost at a dead heat			1
it is the third month running that the two parties have had virtually the same number of points			0
@entity58 's @entity14 are one point behind the @entity15 with 33 per cent - the third month that the two parties have been virtually the same @entity60 , director at @entity35 , said : ‘ we used to talk about parties getting themselves through the “ magic ” 40 per cent threshold before they would be in serious contention to win , but less than a year before a general election , both the big parties are currently struggling to get themselves into the middle 30s , which , of course , only the @entity15 managed in 2010			1
’ mr @entity60 also suggested that @entity3 's apparent decline in popularity is fairly normal for parties who are propelled into the limelight during mid-term elections			2
he said the party dropped to a similar extent - from 18 per cent to 12 per cent - from may to june last year			1
meanwhile , according to the @entity36 , the polls shows there are not many factors separating the two more popular parties in the current polls			0
support from men and women is evenly spread across both parties , reflecting a change from previous years which showed a far lower number of women voting for the conservatives			0
@entity15 also appear to have a fairly even spread of voters from across the demographic , with 30 per cent voting from the lowest de occupational grade and 34 per cent from the @entity97 professionals			2
but results for the leading party are still uneven when it comes to age and the regions where people vote			0
more than half ( 52 per cent ) of the over- 65s are still more likely to vote @entity21			0
the party also appears to have much less support in @entity107 ( 21 per cent ) , @entity108 ( 18 per cent ) and the north ( 21 per cent ) , compared with the @entity110 , where it has 46 per cent .			0
