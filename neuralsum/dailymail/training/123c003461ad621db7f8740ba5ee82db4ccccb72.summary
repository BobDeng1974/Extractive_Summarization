by @entity0 this is the moment a 65 - year - old grandfather is pounced on by police , bent over double and his arms twisted behind his back at a peaceful demonstration by the elderly and disabled			1
@entity9 ’s arrest at a protest against travel pass cuts was described as disgusting by campaigners last night as police chiefs revealed they were investigating the incident			1
the former health service manager was among dozens of campaigners – some in wheelchairs or using walking sticks – who had gathered at @entity21 railway station to demand the return of free travel on public transport , which was axed in march			1
both were taken to hospital			0
two people using sticks were reportedly knocked over and a man was ‘ almost knocked out of his wheelchair			1
' a journalist from the local paper was allegedly threatened with arrest under the @entity43 and made to delete footage because he did not have permission to film at the station			1
@entity47 were videoed as they ‘ jumped ’ mr @entity9			2
one woman , shocked by their heavy - handedness , shouted : ‘ what are you doing ? he ’s an old man , leave him alone			2
’ fellow protester @entity53 , 64 , a grandfather and former primary teacher , was also arrested			0
mr @entity53 , who allegedly travelled on a train without buying a ticket as part of the protest , was charged with fare evasion and both men were charged with obstructing a police officer			1
members of @entity64 and @entity63 were demonstrating after @entity65 axed free rail travel for elderly and disabled passengers in the region and restricted free bus and tram passes to save more than £ 600,000 a year			2
' leave him alone ' : bystanders lambasted police officers for treating the old man roughly scuffle : protesters had earlier arrived in @entity21 by train from a nearby station to demonstrate against service cuts in a partial u-turn , free travel for the disabled was restored last month and pensioners were given half - price rail fares at certain times			1
but the campaign has continued with ‘ freedom rides ’ in which protesters travel without paying their fare			0
accompanied by police , up to 60 travelled from @entity63 station to @entity21 on monday , with some refusing to buy a ticket			1
arrested : @entity9 , 65 , today said his back and arms were hurt during the arrest when they got off the train police formed a cordon blocking their exit from the platform			1

’ he said officers took action as he addressed the group using a megaphone			2
‘ two officers grabbed me and said i was arrested , ’ he added			0
‘ i was dragged down the platform with other protesters trying to get me free			0
’ commenting on the police , he said : ‘ there is widespread disgust at their behaviour			0
’ mr @entity9 said he was ‘ jumped from behind ’ by police when he ‘ tried to link arms ’ with mr @entity53 as he was being arrested			1
he added : ‘ it was extremely uncomfortable and absolutely not necessary			0
i was not hitting out or anything , there was no need for that action			0
‘ this all happened very close to the edge of the platform			0
it was all very dangerous			0
’ the police said : ‘ a number of incidents have been brought to our attention			0
we are in the process of fully investigating these			0
’ mr @entity53 and mr @entity9 , both of @entity63 , will appear before @entity21 magistrates on july 7 .			1
