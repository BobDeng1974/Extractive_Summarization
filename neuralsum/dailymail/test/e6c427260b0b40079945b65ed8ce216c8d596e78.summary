it ’s 11 years since @entity1 won the title			1
they went from @entity4 to @entity5			0
and you can throw bottlers into that description as well			2
of course @entity9 could implode and hand the title to @entity1 over the next six weeks or so , but that ’s unlikely			1
if it does happen it ’s a title that ’s long overdue and nothing can ever take away the barren years when @entity1 and @entity14 were an embarrassment at home and abroad – specialists in failure			1
those years will always hang heavy around @entity14 ’s neck			0
yes , yes , there ’s the @entity21 currently sitting there in the trophy cabinet alongside the shiny shield they won in august			0
and yes , yes , they are clear favourites to win it again			2
an @entity21 is n’t the definition of success for the great clubs of @entity30			0
only the @entity14 apologists ca n’t see that			0
@entity33 celebrates @entity1 's third goal by @entity35 in their win over @entity37 on saturday @entity14 's @entity38 now have 15 wins from 17 games since @entity41 , but it 's come too late so are gooners seduced by this end of season run they ’re currently on ? it ’s impressive , no question			1
15 wins in 17 games since their loss @entity41			1
but this is classic @entity14 is n’t it ? after that defeat at @entity52 on january 1 the @entity38 were sixth in the table , 13 points behind leaders @entity9			1
@entity14 and the players felt they had no hope of winning the title , and so they started to play with freedom , and the wins kept coming			2
as soon as the pressure is off , @entity14 looks like he can still do it			0
but once the pressure is on he crumbles , and his players lose their bottle completely			0
@entity35 drills his shot by @entity68 as @entity1 's impressive run continued against @entity37 per @entity69 ca n't stop this shot from @entity71 as they fall 2 - 0 to @entity52 on @entity41 the only two defeats in this current run were the two key games all @entity1 fans desperately wanted to win – at @entity77 and at home to @entity79 in the @entity80 : the two games with more pressure on them than any others on this run			1
they went to @entity79 for the second leg with no pressure on them , everyone thought they were out , and so it proved			2
but with the pressure off , @entity1 turned it on			2
@entity1 are clearly a lot better than most of the teams they face			2
and they are now making the kind of signings they should be making – marquee players			0
so much is in place for real success to come			0
but the task for @entity14 now is to show some balls , cope better when the pressure is on			0
and he and his players need to stop failing in certain games			2
@entity108 celebrates his second strike in the 2 - 1 win for @entity77 over their @entity112 rivals @entity113 scores the second of three away goals for @entity79 that ruined @entity1 's @entity30 campaign dodgy results will happen to all sides of course			1
but i ’m talking about the ones that should have been avoided			0
this season for example , if they ’d won a game they were winning at @entity125 , if they had n’t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at @entity127 , and if they ’d kept the lead at 10 - man @entity37 , @entity1 would be top			1
those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points , have stopped @entity1 being serious title contenders this season			1
when you analyse it like that , you can understand the frustrations of the @entity1 fans after that @entity127 defeat in december			1
@entity141 slumps to the ground as @entity1 bow out of the @entity80 last 16 @entity143 scores in the @entity38 ' 2 - 0 win at @entity79 as they fell short again when it really counts @entity14 has been given time to fail repeatedly , and he ’s still there			1
he now needs to make the most of his incredible good fortune and start earning his £ 8m a year as the fourth - highest - paid football manager in the world			0
winning games when the pressure is off is something @entity14 has proved he can do regularly			0
now he needs to learn how to cope and succeed when the pressure is on			0
if he does that , then there really is no reason why @entity1 ca n’t win a major trophy , the kind of trophy that defines success for big clubs , and end an embarrassing period of failure for @entity14 .			1

@entity1 have a chance at the @entity169 title if @entity9 throw it away
the @entity38 are on a terrific run of 15 wins in 17 since january 2 's loss
the two defeats in this spell were at @entity77 and at home to @entity79
these were the two key games all @entity1 fans desperately wanted to win
read : @entity1 have exactly the same record in league as last season
