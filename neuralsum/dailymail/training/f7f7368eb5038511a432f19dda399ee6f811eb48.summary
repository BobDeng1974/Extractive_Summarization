by @entity0 jellyfish blooms around the world are on the rise			0
recent warm weather and global warming have both been linked with an increase in sightings as well reports of giant jellyfish reaching the shores in the @entity11			2
to accurately plot this upsurge , a team of international researchers has created the @entity15 , or @entity16 , to track locations and predict the future spread			1
the @entity15 , or @entity16 , pictured , plots the location of jellyfish globally			1
it is the first of its kind to track how the marine creatures are distributed			1
researchers from @entity25 have already used to it discover the spread in the @entity28 is thought to be due to the sea surface temperature they look like something from a horror film , but barrel jellyfish recently spotted off the coast of the @entity11 are the ' basking shark ' of their species - enormous but harmless , feeding only on miniscule prey			1
often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the @entity40 , the @entity41 and off the @entity42			0
but it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland , which is why recent sightings in @entity48 have made headlines			0
and when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate , creating huge swarms			0
beneath the dustbin lid - shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ( ' pores ' ) , each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton			0
the stings , however , are not strong enough to harm humans			0
source : @entity64 as well as tracking where the largest concentrations of jellyfish currently are , scientists can use the database to learn more about their ecosystems			1
the international study was led by the @entity25			0
currently , tracking the ecological and societal impacts of jellyfish and jellyfish blooms is hampered due to a lack of information			1
the @entity16 map attempts to address this knowledge gap and covers the upper 650ft ( 200 metres ) of the world ’s oceans			2
this can be used to explore what causes the patterns of distribution , and why jellyfish are concentrated in certain locations around the world			2
for example , using data from @entity16 , authors of the study were able to show that jellyfish and other gelatinous zooplankton are present throughout the world 's oceans			1
but the greatest concentrations are in the mid-latitudes of the @entity98			2
as well as tracking where the largest concentrations of jellyfish currently are , scientists can use the database to learn more about their ecosystems and plot the future spread and distribution			1
stock image of the purple - striped jellyfish , also known as the @entity109 is pictured in the @entity28 , in particular , dissolved oxygen and rising sea surface temperatures were found to be the main cause of the large spread of jellyfish in this area			1
the greatest concentrations were spotted in the mid-latitudes of the @entity98			0
dissolved oxygen and rising sea surface temperatures were found to be the main cause of the large spread ‘ with this resource , anyone can use @entity16 to address questions about the spatial and temporal extent of jellyfish populations at local , regional and global scales , and the potential implications for ecosystem services and biogeochemical processes , ’ said dr @entity119 of the @entity120			1
the analysis will be the first step to establishing a database that plots gelatinous presence in the @entity136 ’s oceans			0
from which , future trends can be assessed and hypotheses tested			0
the map complements the findings of a 2013 study , led by dr @entity119 : ‘ if jellyfish biomass does increase in the future , particularly in the @entity98 , this may influence the abundance and biodiversity of zooplankton and phytoplankton , having a knock - on effect on ecosystem functioning , biogeochemical cycling and fish biomass			1
’ @entity16 currently holds more than 476,000 records on global jellyfish populations spanning the past two centuries			2
it has been designed as an open - access database for researchers , and the public , to use and contribute to			0
the results of the study , led by dr @entity163 from @entity25 , appear in the latest issue of @entity165 .			0

@entity15 , or @entity16 , plots the location of jellyfish globally
it is the first of its kind to track how the marine creatures are distributed
study found a high concentration in the middle of the @entity98
the spread in the @entity28 is thought to be due to an increase in sea surface temperature
by tracking jellyfish , scientists can plot the future spread and distribution
