by @entity0 for @entity1 a cash - strapped council has fronted £ 150,000 for a @entity5 police drama to be filmed in the town after making cuts in the budget for @entity9			1
earlier this month it was revealed @entity11 had axed all funding for surveillance cameras in a bid to save £ 9.6million			0
but this week residents learned filming for the second series of @entity17 will begin in the seaside town of @entity19 , with the council agreeing to fund the production if an application for a @entity23 @entity22 is turned down			1
an @entity38 version of the crime drama appeared on the @entity5 while others tuned into a @entity36 version on @entity42 , drawing in around 500,000 viewers between them			2
when filming for the second season came into uncertainty , the council guaranteed the money claiming the ' economic benefits ' of having the production in the area were worth the cost			0
residents have slammed the decision as ' totally inappropriate '			1
' both the @entity5 and @entity42 already receive huge taxpayer subsidies , so council tax residents in @entity57 will now be doubly hit hard , ' said @entity58 of the @entity59			0
' when public finances are so stretched it ’s totally inappropriate for the @entity11 to be funding tv shows and they need to reconsider their position immediately			2
' among budget cuts recently announced was a £ 150,000 reduction to @entity9 , the cancellation of £ 44,000 in funding for a local swimming pool , an £ 80,000 reduction to road gritting services and the closure of two libraries			1
but the council said paying for the filming will make them money , with an estimated £ 1million generated for the local community from the last series			2
residents in the town described the decision as ' totally inappropriate ' when the council faces such severe budget cuts @entity19 is a popular tourist resort on the west coast of @entity36			1
it was the backdrop for the drama in its first series a spokesman said : ' the council is pleased to be in a position to provide this underwriting facility for this successful drama series			0
' a study by @entity93 into the economic impact of @entity17 on @entity19 and the surrounding area concluded that the first series generated an economic benefit of just over £ 1m which was a welcome injection into the local economy			1
' it is hoped the economic benefit will be even greater as a result of this second series			0
' ' if the @entity23 grant application is fully approved as submitted there will be no call on the council ’s underwritten sum			0
