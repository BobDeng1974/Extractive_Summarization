@entity0 is clearly enjoying himself at @entity1 as he settles into life at the @entity4 giants since his big - money move from @entity6 this summer			1
the 27 - year - old , who made his debut for the club as a late substitute in a 6 - 0 friendly win over @entity13 side @entity12 on monday , looked in buoyant mood as he trained with his team - mates ahead of their @entity17 opener at home to @entity19 on sunday night			1
@entity0 is expected to make his competitive debut for his new side in a mouthwatering clash against arch - rivals @entity23 in @entity24 on october 26 following the completion of his four - month domestic ban for biting @entity27 at the @entity28			0
the likes of @entity0 and @entity47 have signed long - term deals with the club as they now await a two - year wait before they can sign anyone else after their appeal for their transfer ban was rejected by @entity55			0
luckily @entity38 has a squad of top class players at his disposal as they look to win their second @entity17 title in three years this season			2
quality : @entity0 and @entity29 will be looking forward to the start of the season albeit the former has a long wait yet experience : former @entity67 defender @entity47 will bring quality to the @entity1 backline			0

@entity0 looks more than happy at his new club in @entity72
