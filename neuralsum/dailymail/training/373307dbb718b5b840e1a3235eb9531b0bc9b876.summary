by @entity0 for the @entity1 from goji berries to acai , chia seeds to quinoa , every day there seems to be a new ‘ superfood ’ hitting the supermarket shelves			1
each has huge health claims — promising to protect against everything from cancer to weight gain — and often a price tag to match			2
not to mention a celebrity following			2
according to the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , 61 per cent of people questioned had purchased a food just because it had been labelled a ‘ superfood ’			1
but what exactly is a superfood — and are they really all they ’re cracked up to be ? nutritionist @entity25 is sceptical : ‘ there is no definition of a superfood , except that it ’s a food with a marketing department , ’ he says			1
‘ it helps when the food in question comes from an exotic , remote area and “ has been widely used by tribesmen for thousands of years ”			1
they tend to have a hefty price tag , which adds to the allure			2
’ @entity25 is not the only one with reservations			1
the @entity39 has banned the term on packaging , unless it can be backed up with substantial science , and @entity43 has deemed the phrase ‘ just a marketing tool ’			1
even worse than the foods not living up to the hype , some claims have been made that , in high doses , these foods can actually be harmful , resulting in thyroid problems and arthritis flare - ups			1
which ? magazine says we could save up to £ 440 a year by ditching expensive superfoods in favour of old - fashioned , vitamin - rich foods such as kiwi fruit and broccoli			1
not - so - super reality : the current fad for adding raw kale to everything from salads to smoothies means you are consuming compounds known as glucosinolates			1
in certain people these can interfere with thyroid function , enlarging it and causing a mass known as a goiter , in very high doses			1
hormones produced by the thyroid control everything from fatigue to anxiety , and can even cause weight gain			0
@entity91 ’s verdict : @entity62 is only considered to interfere with the thyroid when eaten raw , and you ’d have to eat a lot for it to be an issue — one green smoothie a day is n’t going to hurt you			0
better yet , cook it			0
when these vegetables are lightly steamed , this issue goes away , and they ’re very healthy			0
@entity99 @entity63 : goji berries have been a traditional part of @entity103 medicine for centuries			0
available in dried fruit or juice form , these shrivelled , red berries are alleged to boost the immune system and brain activity , protect against heart disease and cancer and improve life expectancy			1
not - so - super reality : the @entity18 argues that you would need to drink 13 servings of goji berry juice to get as many antioxidants as you ’d find in one red apple			1
concern has been raised that goji berries are rich in a chemical compound called saponins , which increases the risk of a digestive syndrome called ‘ leaky gut ’ , which may let toxins seep into the body			1
the berries may also interact with diabetes and blood pressure medicines , and have been linked to skin rashes			0
finally , goji berries are part of the nightshade family of plants , which can cause inflammation and exacerbate conditions such as arthritis			0
@entity91 ’s verdict : i would always go for fresh rather than dry berries , which have a higher ratio of sugar to fibre , and eat blueberries , raspberries , strawberries and blackberries for antioxidants — and a better taste			0
@entity152 @entity63 : these are from a mint - like plant that grows in @entity154			1
weight for weight , chia has up to eight times more omega - 3 than salmon , and the seeds are full of protein , minerals and antioxidants			1
they are also good for dieters , as they make you feel fuller			0
not - so - super reality : chia seeds swell to a gelatinous mass in the stomach and can cause tummy aches , wind and bloating			1
they are also high in phytates , antioxidant compounds that have the potential to inhibit the absorption of certain minerals			0
they ’re also very pricey : 500g costs up to £ 10			1
@entity91 ’s verdict : do you really want to eat 300g of chia seeds , or would you rather eat the salmon ? @entity185 @entity63 : the @entity187 supergrain ( though it is n’t actually a grain , but a seed ) contains up to 18 per cent more protein than any other grain , and amino acids to build muscle and body tissue			1
naturally gluten - free , it ’s low gi			1
not - so - super reality : despite the protein , quinoa contains potentially gut - irritating saponins and lectins			1
some report gas and bloating after eating it , which might be because of its very high fibre content			0
there are concerns about cross-contamination with wheat in the fields where it ’s grown or in processing plants , which means it may not be as gluten - free as thought			2
@entity91 ’s verdict : quinoa is a great source of protein — the only concern i have is that so much of it is exported , the locals ca n’t afford to buy it in @entity225 any more			0
@entity226 @entity63 : coconut water has become @entity229 ’s fastest - growing soft drink			2
it ’s made by extracting the fluid inside unripe green coconuts			0
the drink is said to be high in potassium and magnesium			0
these minerals are depleted after exercise , so coconut water is often sold as a post-workout drink			0
not - so - super reality : while coconut water is relatively low in calories ( around 20kcal per 100ml ) , most of these come from naturally occurring sugar			2
one 330ml serving contains three teaspoons of sugar , half your recommended daily allowance			0
a 2012 study concluded there was little difference between water , coconut water and sports drinks in promoting rehydration after exercise			0
@entity91 ’s verdict : i like the taste , but it is no more hydrating than plain water — and far more expensive			2
@entity262 @entity63 : with double the antioxidants of blueberries , along with protein , fibre , essential fats , vitamins and minerals , they are also touted as a weight - loss aid			2
not - so - super reality : the supposed weight - loss effect is unproven , and few scientific studies have tested the benefit of acai in promoting weight loss			2
@entity91 ’s verdict : i do n’t believe acai berries help you lose weight , and there is debate as to whether we benefit from ingesting such concentrated levels of nutrients in one go			0
@entity286 @entity63 : loved by everyone from @entity288 to @entity289 , this liquidised or powdered grass is an ingredient in juices and smoothies			0
not - so - super reality : it does n’t even contain enough nutrients to count towards your five - a - day			2
@entity91 ’s verdict : @entity297 is a cheaper , easier alternative — it contains chlorophyll , vitamins a , @entity301 and @entity302 , iron and calcium , and is a fraction of the price .			0
