@entity0 is preparing to take his place in boxing 's @entity2 in expectation of @entity5 succeeding him as @entity7 's latest world super-middleweight champion			1
the @entity9 maestro , who retired undefeated after a stellar career , goes to @entity11 for his ultimate individual honour immediately after the mega rematch at @entity14 between @entity5 and @entity15			1
@entity0 will be among the record 80,000 crowd at the national stadium on saturday week to watch the two aspirants to his throne resolve their bitter dispute following the controversy of @entity15 's stoppage win last november			1
defiant : @entity0 insists he will not come out of retirement to face the winner of @entity15 vs @entity5 rematch : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) will face each other for a second time on may 31 the animosity between @entity15 and @entity0 as they vie for their place in ring history is well documented , but the man who retired undefeated did his best to set that aside as he weighed up the prospects for @entity14			1
first , @entity0 insisted that he would refuse to come back to face the winner , even for one hundred million dollars			1
although he did say : ' maybe if i 'd been even a couple of years younger than i am now , at 42 , i would have considered beating either of them			0
i would n't risk my legacy			0
' then he ran the rule over the fight which is capturing the imagination of the @entity7 public and promising to galvanise massive interest in boxing in @entity7			0
he said : ' you can make a case for both @entity15 and @entity5			1
has @entity15 become too old ? has @entity5 improved enough ? ' to begin with it 's ironic for me to think that @entity5 was born in the same hospital as me in @entity50 , west @entity51 , just a few years later			1
' is youth on his side ? well , you have to ask yourself if @entity15 can improve on the first fight as he is coming up to 37			2
but then again , can @entity5 follow up from his surprising performance in that one and go one better ? ' the issue hangs around whether @entity5 is a 12 - round fighter			2
not everyone has that distance in them			0
@entity15 has because , like me , we should 've been 15 - round men			2
last time out : @entity5 connects with a left hand during his stoppage defeat to @entity15 controversial : referee @entity68 stopped @entity5 from continuing in @entity69 in november last year ' it 's a question of the stamina			1
@entity15 still appears to have the cardiovascular capacity to go any distance			2
i expect we 're going to find that out about @entity5			2
' @entity15 is beginning to look like he 's slowing up but then he will take @entity5 more seriously this time			1
@entity5 is faster but does he have the steam for a long fight ? ' in the end i look at it and think that @entity5 , with his backing - off style , would 've been more of a problem for me if i ever thought of coming back to meet one of them			2
so if push comes to shove i 'd go for him			0
' although in my own mind i believe that in my prime i would 've beaten either of them , @entity89 , who i think can give them both a lot of trouble , and @entity94 , who is similar to @entity96 , but who i got the better of			0
' @entity0 happily agrees that @entity98 is good for @entity7 boxing and will generate renewed fascination with the hard old game			1
but ask him who he admires most of all throughout his half - a - lifetime involved in the ring and he says : ' @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
they were involved in great fights against each other			0
' legend : @entity0 ( second from left ) is set to be inducted into boxing 's @entity2 in june @entity104 is the pick of the bunch , who since marvellous @entity104 always attends the @entity2 ceremony , he is looking forward to making his acquaintance for the first time in the first week in june			1
@entity0 said : ' i 've had the pleasure of meeting @entity105 several times but never @entity104 and i ca n't wait			0
' he was talking at a @entity123 lunch in @entity51 which he recalls was held in the same restaurant in which he announced his signing for legendary manager / promoter @entity126 21 years ago			0
although he knows he could still make a fortune from driving himself out of retirement to face @entity15 or @entity5 - albeit not as much as one hundred million dollars - he says : ' i always promised i would stay retired and i will			1
it is a great honour for me to be inducted into the @entity2			2
it ’s very emotional for me and my father @entity132 , who was the perfect trainer for me			0
‘ if i were to risk my place in history by coming back too late and sacrificing my unbeaten record then , never mind the money , i 'd be miserable for the rest of my life			0
' @entity98 will be televised live on may 31 on @entity139 .			0

@entity0 believes he would have been too good for both @entity15 and @entity5
the @entity142 is set to be inducted into boxing 's @entity2 next month
@entity15 and @entity5 will face each other in a rematch at @entity14 on may 31
