by @entity0 published : 16:08 est , 11 august 2012 updated : 03:02 est , 13 august 2012 @entity2 chiefs faced a barrage of criticism last night over a report attacking the work of military charity @entity7			1
former @entity9 chief @entity8 accused the broadcaster of an ‘ abuse of the truth ’ over claims the charity was subsidising government rehabilitation buildings rather than spending on everyday care for veterans			1
writing in today ’s @entity18 , lord @entity8 says the report took television journalism to a ‘ depressingly low point ’			1
' abuse of the truth ' : writing in the @entity18 , former @entity9 chief @entity8 has criticised a @entity2 report that quoted servicemen complaining over the way @entity7 spends funds his attack was echoed across the political divide , with defence secretary @entity30 saying the charity did not deserve the criticism and shadow defence secretary @entity33 adding that the @entity2 ‘ got it totally wrong ’			1
last night the @entity2 was standing by its report , broadcast on @entity37 ’s @entity36 on thursday			1
@entity7 was set up five years ago by ex-serviceman @entity38 and his wife @entity40 to raise money for the care of wounded veterans			1
it has so far raised £ 141 million , with much of that being spent on a series of world - beating ‘ personnel recovery centres ’ run on @entity51 land			2
but the @entity2 report quoted some veterans complaining that the charity was spending money on @entity51 buildings rather than on practical help			1
investigators said they had uncovered examples of injured soldiers having to pay for physiotherapy and prosthetic limbs			1
former @entity63 @entity62 , a double amputee and one of the charity ’s patrons , said it should work more closely with veterans.but ex-chief of the general staff lord @entity8 – who helped set up the charity – mocked the idea that @entity7 had been ‘ duped by the @entity51 ’			1
and he said of the use of the servicemen quoted in the report : ‘ it was a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of the truth			1
’ he also raised fears that @entity36 may have ‘ seriously prejudiced ’ the charity ’s bid to raise another £ 63 million for the centres			1
rehabilitation : private @entity83 , who lost both of his legs in a blast in @entity87 , is pictured with a physiotherapist at @entity89 last night , mr @entity38 said the report was ‘ completely misinformed ’			1
and mr @entity30 joined in the row , saying : ‘ we should n’t be criticising the important work they do ; we should be backing them and encouraging members of the public to continue showing their appreciation of the @entity99 by donating to such worthy causes			1
’ @entity101 ’s mr @entity33 said : ‘ @entity7 should be supported not slurred			2
@entity102 are a major success and to suggest otherwise is misguided			2
’ @entity105 mp sir @entity104 , a member of the @entity106 , said the ‘ tenor of the criticisms was bang out of order ’			2
but the @entity2 said : ‘ we stand by the programme and the high quality of our journalism			1
‘ we accurately and impartially reported our findings and strongly believe it was in the public interest to do so			2
lord @entity8 was given an opportunity to state his view in both the filmed report and the subsequent studio discussion , and he acknowledged that there are indeed problems with the way veterans are cared for			1
’ by @entity8 ' disastrously wrong ' : lord @entity8 claims the @entity36 report has ' backfired ' on programme makers truth is the first casualty of war , it is often said , but where should truth lie in the treatment of the casualties themselves ? not with the @entity2 , it seems			1
thursday ’s @entity36 report on the support for our wounded from @entity139 and @entity87 took tv journalism to a depressingly low point			1
the central proposition was that the service charity @entity7 ( @entity143 ) had been duped by the @entity51 and was spending its millions , donated by a generous public , on ‘ opulent ’ buildings rather than giving money directly to alleviate the needs of our wounded , injured and sick servicemen and women			1
three of the many hundreds of young people who have been helped by @entity143 were persuaded to take a sort of whistleblowing role			2
it was a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of the truth			2
mercifully , it now seems to be an ambush that has backfired on the programme - makers to an embarrassing degree			2
a glance at the @entity143 website puts forward its defence and tells an interesting story			2
@entity7 was created in october 2007 by a small group of people led by @entity38 , an ex-soldier turned cartoonist			0
he and his wife were so appalled at what our wounded returning from @entity139 and @entity87 received by way of medical and welfare support that they felt compelled to act			1
i have seen blood flowing in the streets of @entity181 after two soldiers on either side of me had been shot , and carried the remains of four comrades in plastic bags to a waiting helicopter			1
@entity38 ’s son and my son were serving in @entity139 and @entity87			0
we knew we had to act , whether others liked it or not			0
our first aim was to raise the cash to build a swimming pool for those recovering at the @entity196 at @entity89 , @entity197			0
incredibly , this key establishment on the path to recovery had no proper pool			0
it does now , thanks to the public ’s generosity			0
the dilemma for @entity7 was where to go from there			0
it could have chosen to fold , but it had caught the public imagination and people up and down the country wanted to make a difference for our wounded via @entity143			1
recovery : @entity7 opened its rehabilitation complex at @entity89 , @entity197 , in 2010 it could have chosen to become just an appeal and channel money to other charities			0
indeed , it has done that in part , giving large grants to @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 , among others			0
but @entity226 chose a twin track for the future			0
first , to set up a @entity229 to pay rapidly for individual needs , principally through other charities that were expert in their fields			0
more than 2,000 service people have been helped in this way so far			0
but more importantly , @entity7 saw the strategic need to provide a third stage on the road to recovery – the first stages being clinical care at the @entity242 in @entity243 and then rehabilitation at @entity89			0
the third stage would be a network of @entity247 in major garrisons to help our wounded return to duty or prepare for a new career on civvy street			1
@entity38 and i discussed this in 2008 , but the @entity51 was n’t keen : there was a strong element of ‘ not invented here ’ to the whole discussion			0
and then the economy collapsed and there was no money anyway			0
so after several years of tortuous debate with the @entity51 it was eventually decided to go ahead with the @entity247 , funded largely by the charitable sector , underpinned by a tripartite deal between the @entity51 , the @entity267 and @entity268			0
that has been the focus of @entity143 for the past three years			0
four centres are open , with a fifth soon to follow , but the charity sector has had to put up most of the funding , because the @entity51 chose other priorities for its money – our money			2
is that right ? does the government not have an absolute responsibility to provide fully for those wounded answering the nation ’s call ? many would argue they do			2
morally that must be correct , but what if there is neither the money nor the will ? but little is new			0
we have been here before , with the private , public and charity sectors coming together to deliver our obligation to our wounded			1
that was how the @entity296 at the @entity297 came about , and the @entity298 in @entity299			0
now we have @entity300 on @entity301			0
left derelict by the @entity51 but rented to @entity268 for £ 1 a year , it was transformed by @entity143 and the @entity267 into a @entity303 to take your breath away in terms of what it offers those on the path to recovery			0
' ( the report ) on the support for our wounded from @entity139 and @entity87 took tv journalism to a depressingly low point			1
' former head of the @entity9 lord @entity8 in its determination to attack what is honourable and good , the @entity2 chose to focus on the statues , stained glass and chandeliers : but they were already there and merely dusted or painted recently			1
they chose not to focus on fantastic accommodation and a state - of - the - art gym and learning centre			0
this is where those who have survived the trauma of war – the blood , confusion , deafening noise and sickly stench – can prepare for the rest of their @entity338 given the best of themselves in the line of duty on behalf of the nation , they deserve the best			0
@entity344 provides that for today ’s recovering wounded and must be there for tomorrow ’s veterans too			2
this is why , of the £ 141 million raised by @entity143 , £ 125 million has been committed , principally to the @entity303 programme			0
of this , £ 70 million will go on capital projects , mostly for the centres but some to other charities ’ projects			0
£ 50 million is allocated to the centres ’ running costs and direct support of the wounded			2
to secure these centres for the future and make them fully accessible to veterans , too , @entity268 needs another £ 63 million – but last week , @entity36 seriously prejudiced that aim			0
you have to wonder what the @entity2 ’s agenda is sometimes			1
the @entity364 , which outlines the government ’s moral obligation to veterans , is now part of the law			0
@entity226 may have been seen as an irritant to those comfortable in their traditional approaches to military welfare , but it has been a wake - up call to which many have responded			2
it was @entity378 ’s most admired charity in 2011 , but that made it a target for the @entity2 to bash			1
the @entity2 should adjust its sights to the side , put the @entity51 between the crosshairs and squeeze the trigger usefully			1
how about running a campaign for the government to repay @entity143 the money it has had to spend to do the government ’s work ? that would help to restore the moral balance that @entity36 got so disastrously wrong .			0
