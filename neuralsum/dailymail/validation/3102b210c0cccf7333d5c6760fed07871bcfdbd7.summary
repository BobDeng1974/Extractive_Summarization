the former @entity7 manager has been put in charge until the end of the season			1

but the 50 - year - old does not believe the former regime , backed by @entity31 owner @entity3 's millions , would have welcomed him through the front door on @entity33 so readily			2

' i had a chat with @entity38 yesterday and @entity39 late last night			0

@entity0 will attempt to guide @entity1 to promotion from the @entity50 to the @entity51 ' that 's not to say the people on the board are going to be great successes			1
but whatever they do , it will be for the good of the club			0
' @entity0 hopes he can lead the club to promotion and claim the job on a permanent basis			1
but he acknowledges the task will be a tough one			0
the former nine - in - a - row midfielder - who will give up his coaching duties with @entity69 while in charge at @entity5 - said : ' my first question was : what do they deem a success ? ' you could turn things around slightly , get to the play - off final , get your goalie sent - off after five minutes and then lose on penalty kicks			0
these are the thin lines between success and failure			0
' i think success would be if we could start putting results together , getting belief in everyone , smiles on faces and turn things around			0
