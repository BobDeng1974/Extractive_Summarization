wild cats could be introduced into the @entity3 countryside for the first time in 1,300 years , it emerged yesterday			1
experts want to release lynx , which prey mainly on deer , into woodland in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as part of an ambitious ‘ rewilding ’ scheme			1

‘ we believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity			0
’ while @entity79 , policy director of @entity54 , who would have to licence the reintroduction , said they also had concerns			0
‘ there are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species , ’ he said			0
