by @entity1 reporter published : 21:54 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 02:15 est , 14 june 2012 scientists have discovered a methane - rich tropical lake and several ponds near the equator of @entity8 's largest moon @entity6			1
lakes were previously spied near @entity6 's polar regions but it was previously believed that bodies of liquid could not exist at @entity6 's midsection because energy from the sun at those latitudes would cause methane pools to evaporate			1
' this discovery was completely unexpected because lakes are not stable at tropical latitudes , ' said planetary scientist @entity22 of the @entity23 , who led the discovery team			0

a new study suggests the dark areas near the moon 's equator indicate the presence of a hydrocarbon lake and several ponds by measuring reflected sunlight from @entity6 's surface and atmosphere , the international @entity39 spacecraft detected a dark region near the landing site of @entity45 , a companion probe that parachuted to @entity6 's equator in 2005			1
scientists said further analysis of the dark feature suggests the presence of a 927 - square - mile ( 2,400 square - kilometer ) hydrocarbon lake - twice as big as @entity53 , a freshwater lake that borders @entity55 and @entity56			0
near the equatorial lake were hints of four shallow ponds similar in size and depth to marshes on @entity63			0
the findings were detailed in thursday 's issue of the journal @entity67			0
@entity6 is among the few bodies in the solar system with a dense atmosphere , but scientists have wrestled over the source of the thick blanket of nitrogen and methane			1

scientists have been surprised at the findings having previously thought lakes only existed at the poles methane gas in the atmosphere is constantly broken up by sunlight and falls to the surface where it is transported back to the poles , condensing to form lakes			0
scientists do not think this process is driving the presence of mid-latitude lakes and ponds			0
rather , they think there may be an underground source of methane that periodically vents to the surface to form the hydrocarbon bodies of liquid			2
' @entity6 may have oases , ' @entity98 said			2
@entity100 , a planetary scientist at the @entity101 , said the latest find was interesting , but noted that the evidence was indirect			0
if a subterranean source of methane is confirmed , it 's a step toward understanding the persistence of methane in @entity6 's atmosphere , said @entity100 , who was not part of the research team .			1
