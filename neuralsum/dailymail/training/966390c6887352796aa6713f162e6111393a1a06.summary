her curious behaviour seen nesting and eventually cuddling her rubber ‘ kong ’ toy gradually tipped off her keepers			0
when the cub was born at 10.45pm on september 16 , she cast the toy aside and held her tiny baby tight in her paws so that it would be warm and have easy access to her milk			2
she kept the cub so tight to her chest that zookeepers were scarcely able to catch a glimpse of the newborn from the camera inside the panda den. zookeepers recorded the purrs and ' honks ' of the contented newborn and took the noises as confirmation that she was healthy			2
