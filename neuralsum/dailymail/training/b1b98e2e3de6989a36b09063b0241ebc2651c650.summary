by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:07 est , 25 december 2013 @entity2 : 04:08 est , 25 december 2013 a lawyer for an @entity5 diplomat whose arrest and strip search in @entity8 drew angry responses from officials in @entity5 accused @entity12 authorities of bungling the investigation			1
on tuesday attorney @entity14 said the agent who drew up charges against his client made a key error in reading a form submitted on behalf of a domestic worker for @entity21 , @entity5 's deputy consul general in @entity8			2
she was arrested two weeks ago and charged with submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her @entity8 housekeeper			1
' mistake ' : @entity21 's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she 'd submitted for her @entity8 maid @entity14 said in an email that the error was in ‘ erroneously and disastrously ’ mistaking @entity21 's listed base salary of $ 4,500 per month for what she intended to pay her housekeeper			1
the lawyer said @entity21 's salary needed to be listed on the form so that @entity12 embassy officials in @entity5 would know that @entity21 had sufficient income to be able to pay her housekeeper $ 1,560 per month , or $ 9.75 per hour for a 40 - hour workweek			1
in court documents , authorities claim she paid her housekeeper about $ 3.31 per hour			0
in an interview , @entity14 said it became apparent as he and others closely reviewed the forms @entity21 was required to submit to arrange for the hiring of her housekeeper that the information she had submitted had been misunderstood			0
‘ it 's incredibly unsexy kind of information , but it does go right to the heart of what this is about , ’ he said			1
@entity21 was arrested earlier this month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her housekeeper and paying her only $ 3 per hour prosecutors declined to comment on @entity14 's claims			2
@entity14 has represented @entity21 since she was arrested december 13 , charged with lying on a visa form about how much she paid her housekeeper			2
@entity12 secretary of state @entity62 has expressed regret over the case while @entity5 officials have said they are outraged , particularly at a strip - search of @entity21 that they say was degrading and unnecessary , though @entity12 authorities have called it standard procedure			1
@entity21 has said she has full diplomatic immunity , though @entity12 officials have said her immunity is limited to acts performed in the exercise of consular functions			2
@entity76 , the husband of housekeeper @entity77 ( pictured ) , filed a court petition in @entity79 saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat @entity21 in @entity8 she has been transferred to @entity5 's @entity82 mission , an assignment that has been processed by the @entity5 government and the @entity82 but awaits @entity86 approval			1
she would have broader immunity in that position			0
in an unusual statement last week , @entity12 attorney @entity89 responded to what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case by saying @entity21 was accused of creating false documents and lying to the @entity12 government about what she was doing , including hiring a housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was contracted to work			1
@entity99 , father of @entity5 diplomat @entity21 , has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment he also questioned why there was ‘ precious little outrage ’ about the treatment of the @entity5 housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about the alleged treatment of @entity21			0
he said his office 's sole motivation was to uphold the law , protect victims and hold lawbreakers accountable , ‘ no matter what their societal status and no matter how powerful , rich or connected they are			0
’ in the dock : an artist 's sketch of @entity21 at her arraignment in @entity124 last week protesters in the eastern @entity5 city of @entity127 , burn an effigy of @entity129 as the international fall - out of dr @entity21 's domestic dispute continues to escalate these developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions			2
@entity76 , ms @entity77 's husband , filed a petition at the @entity139 in @entity79 in july saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day			0
mr @entity76 also said the consular official 's father @entity99 had threatened mrs @entity77 's family saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug charges			0
in the petition , first seen by @entity146 , a concerned mr @entity76 wrote : ' the treatment of @entity77 by @entity21 is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery - like conditions or keeping a person in bondage			0
' the petition also stated : ' @entity99 called @entity77 's family several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future , get them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them			0
' mr @entity76 also wrote that @entity21 had accused his wife of stealing in front of a @entity12 immigration officer but would not provide details of what the woman took			0
a group supporting domestic workers ' rights demonstrate across the street from the @entity5 consulate general on december 20 in @entity8 mrs @entity77 's daughter @entity172 also wrote a letter to @entity12 officials saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to @entity5 but the diplomat refused to let her go			1
mr @entity76 's claim was dismissed in july , according to his lawyer , because the high court claimed ' no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign soil '			0
the case has escalated into an international incident with @entity5 reacting with fury over the treatment of @entity21 and her claim of being strip searched at a @entity8 jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers .			1

lawyer for @entity21 claim 's officials mistook her listed base salary for what she intended to pay her housekeeper
' it 's incredibly unsexy kind of information , but it does go right to the heart of what this is about , ' he said
@entity21 was arrested in early december , charged with submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her @entity8 maid
her detainment and *subsequent* strip search has soured @entity12 - @entity5 *relations*
