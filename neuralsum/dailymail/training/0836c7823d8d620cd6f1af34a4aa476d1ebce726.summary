by @entity0 published : 21:08 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 10:50 est , 28 february 2013 @entity3 tycoon sir @entity2 ’s retail success could easily be turned into a business bestseller			1
the new life of his sister @entity6 , however , has all the elements of a @entity9 romcom			1
six years after divorcing her graphic designer husband @entity11 , she has been dabbling in romantic liaisons with men she ’s met on dating websites			1
lucky in love : @entity16 , the sister of @entity3 tycoon sir @entity2 , has written the autobiography of soul singer @entity20 after meeting him on a dating website now these contacts have opened up a career for her as a writer , after completing 75,000 words of a biography of one of her dates : @entity31 soul singer @entity20			1
‘ the first thing that attracted me to @entity35 was the fact that in his description of himself he said he wanted to write a book about his life			1
i wrote back saying i would write it for him , ’ says @entity6 , who lives in @entity32 and recently became a grandmother			1
her brother sir @entity44 's retail success could easily become a business bestseller they met in @entity47 , where she is a regular visitor , but after an initial flurry of passion , romance quickly took a backseat as @entity6 began writing @entity35 ’s life story			1
now they communicate across the @entity55 via @entity56			1
@entity57 , who she says has a great ‘ soulful voice ’ and who has appeared with @entity60 , has ‘ lived five lives in one ’			1
‘ he has a very unusual and unique story to tell , ’ he says			1
they met after sociology graduate @entity6 visited blackpeoplemeet.com			1
so what drew the mother of three to such sites in her hunt for mr @entity71 ? she says she was fed up with many of the men she ’d encountered			1
among them were a @entity76 executive , a @entity78 enthusiast who only talked about @entity79 , and a blind date who boasted he had his own hair and teeth			2
‘ i tried @entity85 dating websites because i am @entity85 and i met a lot of men , but they are n’t my type , ’ she says			1
‘ what i like about these sites is the @entity31 thing			2
i find you can never be too loud , too outspoken or too talkative for an @entity31			2
’ there ’s no stopping prince @entity2			1
in april , two months short of his 92nd birthday , @entity2 — who , as i revealed , is the oldest ever male royal — flies to @entity98 to present new colours to the @entity100			1
by coincidence , @entity2 , who became colonel - in - chief of the regiment in 1953 , succeeded the @entity104 , who he overtook in the longevity stakes on monday			1
blessed with a multi-billionaire husband , three children , homes across the globe and a £ 100 million super- yacht , ex-beauty queen @entity107 is the first to admit she is the most fortunate — as well as the richest — woman in @entity114			2
country - pop passion : former beauty queen @entity107 is now the richest woman in @entity114 ‘ but i have an unfulfilled ambition : i want to be taken seriously as a pop singer , ’ she tells me at a champagne reception to showcase her album , @entity119 , at the @entity120 in @entity121			1
‘ i had some success before i got married , ’ says modest @entity107 , whose song @entity125 was a no 1 for girl band @entity127 in 2000 and who has supported @entity129			2
‘ but then babies came along and i had to give it all up			2
’ a former @entity134 @entity133 , @entity107 , 41 , is married to handsome @entity137 - @entity136 pharmaceutical tycoon @entity135			2
the couple , who live on @entity139 and have a home in @entity141 , use their estimated £ 7.4 billion wealth to support a number of philanthropic causes			2
but country - pop is @entity107 ’s passion			1
on the verge of securing a distribution deal for her album , she says : ‘ i realised i wanted to perform myself			2
‘ it ’s hard to hear your own feelings on radio when someone else is performing them ! ’ dame @entity156 has at last disclosed the naked truth — where she found the courage to disrobe so frequently on stage and in films as a young actress			1
it was all down to @entity163 and @entity164			2
‘ especially @entity163 , ’ she says			2
‘ i remember her on the set of @entity166			2
' she took off her dressing gown , cleared her throat and went : “ ok everybody , this is what it looks like from the front			2
and this is what it looks like from behind			0
now just let ’s get on with it			1
” ' i thought that was great			0
’ the @entity181 will be relieved to hear there is nothing so revealing from @entity184 , reprising her role as @entity186 , in the audience on the @entity189 stage			0
model of the moment @entity192 may be getting as famous for her hard partying as for sashaying down the catwalk			0
but for all the attention she remains level - headed			0
asked about her future , the daughter of property magnate @entity198 and former society model @entity199 reflects : ‘ in five years i ’ll probably be living on a desert island catching fish and growing vegetables			0
’ model @entity192 said she will probably living on a remote island growing her own vegetables in five years time mind you , quite what her godmother @entity208 makes of @entity192 ’s recent bleary - eyed appearances may be instructive			1
in her book , the world according to @entity208 , the actress deplores many modern trends			0
‘ why has the desire to eat , dress and talk properly become something scorned , a source of ridicule ? ’ she wonders			0
‘ you see people sitting in restaurants , elbows on the table , boisterously drunk and talking loudly with open mouths of food			0
even the f - word seems commonplace			0
’ could it be that party animal @entity192 has n’t yet finished reading her own copy of @entity208 ’s tome ? only comedians who appear on tv get their books on to the bestseller lists , says @entity235			1
@entity235 , 64 , whose thriller @entity236 is out in paperback , tells me : ‘ if i was still on tv regularly i do n’t think it would matter in terms of books sales			0
comedians and people like that might sell more books because they are on tv			0
’ @entity235 , who with husband @entity248 hosted @entity249 for 13 years , has no ambition to return to tv			0
‘ i do n’t miss it a bit , ’ she says at the romantic novelist awards at the @entity253			0
‘ i ’d just had enough			0
the world of writing is much more refreshing			0
’ after hearing rave reviews , @entity258 joined a clutch of politicians to see this @entity262 , a play about the @entity265 governments of 1974 to 1979			0
sitting near the front row at the @entity267 , he looked none too pleased during a scene re-enacting one of the most famous incidents in his career — when he caused uproar by seizing the @entity275 mace and brandishing it at @entity276 in 1976			0
during a break in the programme , @entity258 stood up and declared to those nearby : ‘ i simply do n’t recognise myself at all			0
the characters are just very badly drawn			0
’ others suspect the peer did not like the scruffy appearance of the actor playing his role			0
‘ we could not stop watching @entity258 ’s reaction , ’ noted former @entity287 editor @entity286			1
‘ he did not look too happy			0
’ a po - faced @entity289 , meanwhile , tip - toed out of the theatre — no doubt worrying about how her affair with @entity292 will be portrayed on the stage one day			0
in @entity296 , a deep - fried @entity295 bar is a delicacy			0
but for sir @entity299 , the calorific confectionery has provided a winning formula			1
he appears on @entity302 ’s @entity301 , where judges @entity303 and @entity305 awarded him a rosette for his @entity308 ’s @entity262 pudding — named after his mansion — of @entity295 bars , apples and crumble			1
‘ it was a top - secret family recipe my aunt invented , ’ says sir @entity312 , 66			1
‘ @entity308 used to make it for me when i was young			0
up until she passed away at 82 she drove , hunted , drank sherry for @entity317 and lived on @entity295 bars — and it never did her any harm			0

sir @entity2 ’s sister @entity6 has penned @entity20 's biography
