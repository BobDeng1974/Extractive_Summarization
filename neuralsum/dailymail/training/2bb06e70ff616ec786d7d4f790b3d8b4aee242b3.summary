by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 11 may 2013 updated : 17:45 est , 11 may 2013 controversial support : metropolitan police commissioner @entity2 agrees that all arrests should be carried out secretly @entity5 's most senior police chief is backing controversial rules to ensure that all arrests , including those involving high - profile figures , are carried out in secret			1
sir @entity2 , @entity2 , has insisted that new guidelines being drawn up by the @entity12 are as draconian as possible			1
it follows @entity15 ’s call in his report on the media for a blanket ban on naming suspects			1
under the new rules , police will be banned from confirming suspects ’ names , even when journalists know their identity			1
without confirmation , the legal risks of incorrect identification will prevent the media publishing suspects ’ names			2
a senior source who is close to the proposed rules and has met @entity33 , the @entity12 officer in charge of the guidance , said sir @entity2 was driving through the changes			1
the source said part of the reason for his determination to enforce the blanket restriction was growing concern that @entity44 was committing disproportionate resources to high - profile arrests			2
he said : ‘ it was put to me that ‘ ‘ we arrest so many people that it would be ridiculous to name everybody ’ ’			0
’ the claim emerged at the same time as the former @entity53 condemned the police plans			2
lord @entity55 , said : ‘ there should be a presumption police will reveal names of arrested people ... it ’s important the public are told who police are locking up			0
’ sir @entity2 , who is in charge of more than 30,000 police officers , is also said to be concerned about the harm caused by publicity surrounding an arrest when the individual may later be released without charge			1
support : home secretary @entity73 also backed plans for anonymity the police plan for ‘ secret arrests ’ is opposed by the @entity78 , the government ’s own adviser on legal reform , which believes it is in the interests of justice that police release the names of everyone who is arrested , apart from exceptional cases			0
@entity89 said : ‘ my experience as @entity53 showed it is common that an arrest triggers other victims to come forward			0
’ yesterday it emerged that home secretary @entity73 had intervened in the debate by writing to all chief constables , saying she also backed plans for anonymity in arrests			0
‘ i believe that there should be a right to anonymity at arrest , but i know there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named , ’ she said .			0

under new rules police will be banned from confirming suspects
sir @entity2 agrees rules should be strict as possible
