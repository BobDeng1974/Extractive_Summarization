several times at @entity3 on saturday i was left gasping at the quality of @entity6 , he ’s a joy to watch			2
and he ’s not the only one			0
i ’ve been out of my seat at some of the quality in the @entity12 this season – @entity17 ’ range of passing , @entity20 ’s quality , @entity24 ’s running with the ball , @entity22 ’s breathtaking goals , @entity26 ’s twists and turns , even @entity14 at @entity15 has shown some class in midfield , while @entity30 ’s goal at @entity31 made light work of all the clowns who see him solely as a big lump up front			1
@entity20 and @entity37 reflect on a disappointing day for @entity38 at @entity39 @entity40 rips off his shirt as he celebrates scoring the only goal of the game in @entity45 's shock win there is some real quality in the @entity12			1
so why has @entity45 ’s dour display of dire defensive doggedness at @entity39 on sunday been widely applauded ? it ’s three points , it ’s a win , for @entity45 fans it ’s brilliant			1
but as a neutral football observer it was awful to see two top - four teams go head to head , yet only one of them trying to play football reflecting their position in the league			1
@entity38 should have scored – twice they carved @entity45 open but @entity63 failed to finish both chances			1
so the away side got lucky at one end			0
@entity63 failed to convert two chances against @entity45 during @entity38 's 1 - 0 defeat the @entity70 international reflects on a missed opportunity at @entity39 and then at the other end @entity72 fired in a shot that hit the post and could have gone anywhere			1
it fell to @entity40 and @entity45 scored			1
that ’s another stroke of luck			0
so , in the same way @entity45 were unlucky to lose at @entity81 earlier this season - in a very similar game , they created next to nothing , were organised , but played very little football and the @entity86 only broke through when @entity45 went down to 10 men because of injury - they got extremely lucky at @entity39 by getting a break at one end , and seeing @entity38 miss two sitters			1
maybe luck balances itself out , but @entity45 in my view are too good to be relying on luck that may or may not go their way			2
i ’ll stress that if you ’re a @entity45 fan it does n’t matter how your team wins – good luck to them , they can enjoy it			1
@entity100 would have been delighted with his side 's performance at the home of @entity38 former @entity104 midfielder @entity63 looks to the sky after missing an opportunity to score for @entity38 but let ’s not fool ourselves here , @entity45 did n’t go up there to play			1
and that ’s a shame			0
i was at @entity111 ’s when @entity100 ’s side reduced @entity113 to a gibbering wreck earlier this season with a stunning display of brilliant passing football played at a tempo few teams can sustain			2
i want to see more of that			0
at @entity39 though , they had 11 @entity123 on the pitch			0
only with a dollop of luck will that win you the game , and that ’s exactly what happened			0
i can hear the stat - monsters screaming about @entity38 failing to get a shot on target : 1 ) it ’s not true			2
a @entity136 effort was on target in the first half but was blocked by a defender			0
for some reason the official statistics do n’t count a shot blocked by an opposition player , which is weird			0
@entity146 's side failed to find a way past @entity45 who arrived at @entity38 with a defensive gameplan 2 ) one shot on target does n’t mean that @entity38 did n’t play good football and create chances			1
it only means their finishing on the day was wayward			0
before the weekend only the top two had scored more than @entity38 in the @entity12 this season so it was just one of those off days in front of goal for @entity38 , and in particular @entity63			2
in the final analysis , @entity45 won the game , picked up three points and everyone connected with the club is happy			1
for them , that ’s all that matters – a win is a win			0
for the many united - haters across the football world , it will be right up there with their disastrous displays at @entity173 and @entity174			2
@entity24 has been superb for @entity104 , taking on opposition defenders at pace with the ball at his feet @entity179 has lit up the @entity12 with his goals and creative play for @entity81 but for lovers of the beautiful game , there is an acceptance that defending is part of the 90 minutes , but there is also a desire to see expansive football			2
knowing that @entity45 are capable of so much more leaves the neutral frustrated that they did n’t go to @entity39 to show us all what they can do			2
pressing the opposition and pressing them high up the pitch is admirable – @entity195 have enjoyed stunning success doing that			0
but @entity195 played sparkling special football at the same time and that ’s what i thought we ’d see from @entity45 on sunday			1
unfortunately it did n’t happen			0
historically , the @entity12 ’s most admired teams have a bit of everything			0
not just an ability to stop the opposition			0
if @entity45 produce an end - of - season dvd entitled ' 101 @entity208 ' expect the victory at @entity38 to feature highly .			1

in @entity17 and @entity26 there is real quality in @entity213
so , it 's a shock that a dour @entity45 display was so well received
@entity38 were the only team wanting to play football on sunday
all that mattered for @entity45 is the victory and the three points
