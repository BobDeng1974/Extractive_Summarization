by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:19 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:48 est , 19 december 2013 older shoppers were less good at spotting bargains in a test done by @entity7 academics we might expect hearing or eyesight to fade with age – but here ’s one change you might not have bargained on			1
the older we get , the worse we are at spotting the best supermarket deals , new research has revealed			2
despite years of experience , it is younger shoppers who are more attuned to identifying a good discount			2
scientists at @entity7 , @entity22 , carried out @entity24 brain scans on around 30 volunteers who were shown a series of offers and told to save as much money as possible			1
they had to choose what quantity to purchase before moving on to the next item – but some of the examples were bad deals costing more than the original price			0
imaging techniques highlighted hotspots of brain activity revealing ‘ emotional circuitry ’ was used to make some decisions			0
researcher dr @entity40 said younger shoppers definitely have an advantage , adding : ‘ it is unusual because one would think that older people would be better drilled at evaluating what was and what was not a bargain			1
' this is very interesting though we do n’t know exactly why it happens and would like to do some more research to find out why this may be the case			0
’ the research also shows that women shoppers are no better than men when it comes to being able to identify a cut - price deal			1
instead men are level pegging with women when it comes to saving cash on the weekly shop			2
dr @entity63 , one of the lead researchers , said : ‘ the advantage of using @entity24 to image the brain while actively making shopping decisions is that it enables us to see how the whole brain responds , including the ‘ deeper ’ areas of the brain , such as those associated with emotion and desire			1
men and women were equally as good at spotting the best cut - price deal , the research found ‘ this lets us understand more about what makes an offer appealing : in some cases the choice appears to be more rational , and in other cases we can see emotional circuitry getting involved in the decision - making process			1
’ the ‘ supermarket shoppers ’ were taking part in a major cutting - edge project by @entity91 - based @entity90 , one of @entity94 ’s leading shopping behaviour specialists			0
the results of the study will be passed on to product and food manufacturers who provide goods for supermarkets and stores			0
@entity104 , managing director of @entity90 , said : ‘ we know from previous research that the brain behaves illogically when faced with the sort of information overload that shoppers are faced with in a typical supermarket			0
‘ now we have a reliable and scientific way of validating this research and understanding exactly what is happening in the brain during the weekly shop			0

@entity7 scientists carried out @entity24 brain scans on 30 volunteers
younger people better at spotting bargain in a series of offers
but men and women equally as good at spotting cut - price deal
