forget the @entity1 and @entity3 's @entity2 , today 's bright young things want to make their name in the world of technology			2
but for entrepreneurs like @entity8 , who has launched a dating app for lesbians , making money means abandoning life in the @entity3 to travel to @entity13 to look for investment			1
in a new @entity16 documentary , how to be a @entity17 , @entity8 admits : ' i want to raise a million dollars			1
pictured : @entity8 who is the founder of @entity23 ( @entity24 ) a lesbian dating app the 28 - year - old , who grew up in @entity27 , came out to her friends and family as bisexual in her 20s but struggled to find a girlfriend			1
but she struggled to meet someone so ever determined , @entity8 came about creating @entity23 ( now re-branded as @entity24 ) a dating app designed for lesbian , bisexual and curious women			1
she said she decided to create her own app when the ones that were available were n't up to the job			2
' i was with my friends in the pub and we were all signed up to a bunch of different lesbian sites			2
' one of my friends had just split up with her girlfriend and we were signing her up to one of the sites we were on and we knew that what we were using was awful			2
@entity51 made his first million at 18 with his games app @entity52 but the app has since gone into decline seeing @entity51 seeking a five million dollar investment @entity51 has created a @entity52 two which he hopes will set his wealth back on track ' i cared so much about it and then the actual idea for @entity23 came up			1
' on moving to @entity62 , she said : ' its really depressing because you start to realise that everything is completely dependent on money			2
i ca n't ever imagine not doing it and being prepared to give it up			2
' the region may be renowned for its investment in tech but with 5,000 smart phone apps launched each week and only one in ten surviving @entity8 was prepared for knock - backs			1
in fact , the ambitious entrepreneur managed to impress the right people and secured investment from media mogul and co-founder of @entity81 @entity80			2
he said : ' we liked her a lot , super-passionate , she built a great product proving she could execute was getting some early traction			0
' she identified an area that we feel was being under served			0
had the potential to be the market leader in that and at this stage a relatively low valuation			0
' both @entity8 and @entity51 seek the investment of @entity80 the co-founder of @entity81 but with the pressure still on to raise cash , she gave a five minute presentation to 400 influential women at a lesbian technology conference in @entity100			1
a week later , the first figures from the app were promising and within 48 hours of pitching it was the fastest growing lesbian dating app in the city			1
yet , @entity8 admitted to being most thrilled by another claim to fame			1
she recounted a story of someone spotting her @entity23 sticker on her laptop			0
' he said all the girls in his office talking about it and i was like " oh where do you work " and he was like " i work at @entity119 , " ' she laughed			0
after securing her investment , @entity8 is now moving to @entity13 permanently and plans to roll out her app across @entity122			1
another mini-millionaire who is on the hunt for investors is 22 - year - old @entity51 who made his first million at just 18 years old			1
it was his development of the game @entity52 that earned him nearly million a month at its peak			0
but @entity51 says that he was a high earner long before @entity52			1
' it started when i was 11 , i bought a book to teach myself programming and i built a website while teaching other people how to program			0
' within a month i sold the website for two thousand dollars			0
and i realised holy s * * * you can make money doing this ! ' just four years later the child prodigy sold a business for a six figure sum			0
' the funny thing was my parents did n't even know i was running this thing at the time so they had a bit of a shock to find out i had this big windfall			0
' but now three years after relocating to @entity152 @entity51 's wealth is on the line			1
after pitching her app at a lesbian technology conference @entity23 became the fastest growing lesbian dating app in @entity100 having caught the attention of @entity119 magazine @entity159 works for high school confession app fess but believes she is destined for bigger things ' @entity52 was doing pretty well			1
it made millions of dollars and was going up by ten per cent a week we realised it probably would have capped out at a certain level and if you do n't keep growing you 're gon na die - figuratively			0
' in the hope of keeping his fortune going @entity51 created @entity52 2 but desperately needed a five million dollar investment in order to launch the game			1
he said : ' i 'm trying to think what am i going to do next			0
we 're six months behind			0
it feels like we 've done a lot wrong here			0
' ' we were making 10 million a year			0
we 're burning $ 3,000 a day $ 70,000 dollars a month			0
' although @entity51 admitted he and his team would be prepared to work up to 16 - hour days , seven days a week on his business , his chief designer @entity174 revealed that his immense work stress led him to having a heart attack at just 21			1
more investors have withdrawn from @entity51 's project and it is yet to be revealed whether @entity183 , his final hope , would agree to promote @entity52			1
the game 's launch has been postponed until april but @entity51 is still optimistic			1
he said : if i failed tomorrow i would get back up pretty quickly and try again and just keep on trying			0
' the final technology hopeful featured in the documentary is @entity159 , 21 , who moved to @entity152 with her family			2
a social marketing director for @entity192 , which encourages students to share their secrets , @entity159 is confident that she will become the next big thing in the tech boom			2
she said : ' i do n't think anyone else right now would necessarily think of the idea i have			0
that might be cocky and i might be doing a terrible job and i just think i 'm doing a great job			0
