by @entity0 published : 07:54 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 13:53 est , 1 february 2013 people hoping to start a new relationship can generally expect a prospective partner will come with baggage of some kind			2
but @entity6 comes with one of the tallest orders of all - no sex			1
speaking with @entity11 and @entity12 on the @entity14 sofa today , @entity6 confessed she ' hopes to find a man who is wiling to embrace her asexuality '			1
while she is willing to extend intimacy to levels of cuddling , she finds the act of sex itself completely repellent			1
' her teenage years at school were difficult , especially in sex education			2
' it did n't seem like something i would ever do			2
i was embarrassed because everyone was giggling - especially girls			0
' i saw it as a coming of age thing - something i wanted to get it out the way			2
' speaking about her first sexual experience @entity6 said : ' i was in a relationship with someone i trusted who was wonderful , but i saw it as a chore and i did n't want to do it			1
after trying everything in the bedroom to rid her of her disgust for the act she still felt repulsed ' it was a case of " i want to be with him , and i have to do this in order to be with him "			0
' ' all my partners were patient men willing to do anything to make me happy			0
they did n't pressure into anything			0
' but , she says , even after trying everything in the bedroom to rid her of her disgust for the act she still felt repulsed and found sex did n't ' do anything ' for her			1
@entity29 said asexuality affects one per cent of the population in the @entity74 - so it 's a lot more common than people might think			0
@entity6 said she gets frustrated when people say maybe she ' has n't met the right man ' , she 's ' not doing it right ' , or that maybe she just ' likes women but has n't realised it yet '			1
' @entity6 wants to settle down but thinks being ' an asexual vegan who does n't want kids ' will hold her back ' i 'd love to be in a loving relationship and settle down , ' she said			1
' but the extent of intimacy would be cuddling			1
' when asked about her hopes for the future and finding a man to settle down with , @entity6 's reply reveals her fears			1
' i 'm an asexual vegan who does n't want kids - i 'm thinking crazy cat lady			1
' ' i want to get married and have a house - but no sex			0
' she then admitted it was a ' tall order '			0
psychologist @entity29 jumped in and said ' people underestimate men ' and this is ' an opportunity '			0
while it 's a ' tall order ' , psychologist @entity29 said people underestimate men and this is ' an opportunity ' @entity6 said that if she met the man of her dreams and he wanted sex , she would say no. ' i would have to tell them from the beginning			1
i 'd feel like i was compromising myself and i would detest them for making me do something i do n't want to do			1
' since her article for the @entity115 , @entity6 said she 's had really positive response from @entity117 [ the @entity118 ]			2
' a lot of them do n't feel they can come forward and say it , ' she said			2
but , unfortunately , she said she has also had some ' horrible ' comments , like : ' you ca n't get a man and this is how you cover it up '			1
she finished on a final hopeful note that ' there are people who physically ca n't have sex and still have relationships ' , and that ' it 's harder of men to admit to it as " being up for it " is expected of them 24/7 '			1
an asexual is someone who does not experience sexual attraction			0
unlike celibacy , which people choose , asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are			0
@entity117 does not make our lives any worse or any better , we just face a different set of challenges than most sexual people			0
there is considerable diversity among the asexual community ; each asexual person experiences things like relationships , attraction , and arousal somewhat differently			0
@entity117 is just beginning to be the subject of scientific research			0
source : @entity117 watch our clip of @entity6 's interview on this morning below			2
the full video will be available on the @entity14 website .			0

@entity6 , 29 , from @entity167 , who does n't want kids , hopes to find a man who will embrace her asexuality
says she wants *potential* partner to accept cuddling as extent of intimacy
if the man of her dreams wanted sex she would say no. ' i 'd feel like i was compromising myself and i would detest them for it '
since writing for the @entity184 has heard from other asexuals but also had *spiteful* comments like : ' you ca n't get a man and this is how you cover it up '
