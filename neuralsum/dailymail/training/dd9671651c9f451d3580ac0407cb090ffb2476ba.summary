by @entity0 @entity2 ’s decision to delay the @entity3 by a month because he has run out of policies has caused a clash with @entity6 – after courtiers warned it could overburden the @entity8 , who turns 88 next month			1
they objected after the prime minister told the @entity10 he intended to move the @entity11 to june 4 , giving her and prince @entity13 – 93 on june 10 – just 24 hours to recover before they travel to @entity15 for a three - day visit to mark the 70th anniversary of @entity18			1
@entity19 then suggested bringing the @entity11 forward a day to june 3 – only for the @entity6 to point out it would clash with a garden party she is hosting			1
it means the @entity8 will face a gruelling five days			2
she will attend the @entity3 of @entity32 and read the @entity11 , which sets out the government ’s legislation for the coming year			2
she will then return to the @entity6 that afternoon and host the garden party a couple of hours later			1
after a single day off , dominated by briefings on her d - day trip , she and the @entity13 will set off for @entity15			1
the @entity40 ’s critics say its lack of policies has created a ‘ zombie @entity32 ’ , with most mps attending @entity32 for just a couple of days a week , and the @entity11 being pushed back while ministers think of ideas to fill it			1
political issues mean the @entity8 will have to speak in parliament on the day of a @entity6 garden party , shortly before she travels to @entity15 mps on all sides last night accused the government of showing ‘ poor manners ’ to the @entity8 for forcing her to change her diary at short notice			1
‘ @entity8 and prince @entity13 have understandably scaled back their appearances because of their increasing age , yet the government is putting them under needless strain to spare its own blushes , ’ said one senior parliamentarian			1
‘ it is rude and disrespectful			0
consideration for the @entity8 should take priority over political embarrassment			0
’ the news comes at a time when @entity70 officials have been trying to curb some of her more onerous responsibilities			0
it was announced last year that the @entity8 and prince @entity13 , who have both recently suffered illness , would be cutting back on their overseas travel ; the visit to @entity15 will be one of just two foreign trips they carry out in 2014			1
the government insists the @entity8 was given ' good notice ' of the change of schedule , but @entity85 mp @entity84 ( right ) said ministers had ' failed to consult ' the monarch the @entity70 couple will travel to meet president @entity89 , staying at the @entity90 , attending state events in @entity92 and continuing on to @entity93 for the commemorations on june 6			1
their visit will coincide with a mass parachute drop by 16 @entity98 to mark the liberation of @entity100 , the first village to be freed from the @entity101 in 1944			0
the event will be followed by a memorial service			0
last night a @entity6 source said the government had told courtiers that the reason for the delay was to avoid a clash with the @entity111 elections in may			0
@entity112 , however , point out that the @entity114 elections have been in the calendar for years			0
a @entity6 spokesman would say only : ‘ we understood why the government wanted to move the date			0
’ a @entity6 spokesman said ' constitutional proprieties ' were extremely important to the @entity8 and her staff when asked whether the @entity6 had objected to the @entity8 delivering the speech the day before she is due to travel , the spokesman said : ‘ it is an extremely busy time			1
‘ we made it clear that the @entity8 would be leaving for the @entity18 celebrations on the 5th , and had a very constructive dialogue on that basis			0
at all times we were guided by the constitutional proprieties			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ the june date has been in the diary for a while now and we made sure that the @entity6 was given good notice			2
we were aware that the @entity8 was planning to travel to the d - day commemorations later that week			2
‘ we know the @entity8 has a very busy diary and we have been sensitive to that fact			2
’ @entity142 mp @entity84 said : ‘ the government had four years to work out when this year ’s @entity3 would take place , and the one person they failed to consult was the one without whom it could not take place – the @entity8			2
‘ this may be a zombie @entity32 , but even the undead normally show better manners			0
’ when @entity153 first revealed the delay , one @entity156 minister said it had arisen because mr @entity2 had ‘ ripped up ’ the proposed programme of legislation , saying it was ‘ not sexy enough ’ .			0

@entity143 moved @entity3 due to lack of policies
changes mean @entity8 , *87* , will have a gruelling week of engagements
she has to speak at opening or risk constitutional crisis , ministers warn
mps accused @entity2 of putting ' needless strain ' on the monarch
@entity6 admits june is ' extremely busy ' for @entity8 and @entity13
she now has to give speech and host garden party before going to @entity15
