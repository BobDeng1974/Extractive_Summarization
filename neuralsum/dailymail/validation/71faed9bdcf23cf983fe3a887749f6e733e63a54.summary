it was n't just the @entity1 — @entity2 always prepared for every game by imagining the worst things that could happen			1
he would muscle up his psychological preparedness by spending time mentally filing through the great times in his career , the things he valued highly in his personal life			2
if he had a stinker , or even if he had a blinder but still could n't stop his opponents getting the better of @entity13 , then he would have a store of precious images and memories with which to dilute the pain of defeat or failure			1
he would rely on them			0
this will be @entity13 's first @entity1 at the @entity22 without @entity2 at the club since 2002 - 13 years			1
@entity24 in training at @entity13 's @entity27 base ahead of @entity1 against @entity28 despite the million - kilowatt glare given off by the stars on the playing surface , i 'll miss his presence — saturnine , deeply competitive , gently eccentric , hugely effective			1
damn good at his job and one of the plethora of characters who have helped elevate this to the best , most regularly high - quality , most - watched game of football in the world			0
i am still learning what @entity24 's mind usually does to him before a big game , and , vice versa , what the former @entity48 keeper tries to do to either dominate or harness the powerful psychological alert system which should be telling him , right about now : ' oh no ! @entity28 again			1
' from the moment when @entity54 scored past him with a free - kick at the @entity57 in february 2007 , where the ball squirted past @entity24 like a wet , angry salmon trying to evade capture , the contest with @entity28 has appeared to have been @entity24 's @entity61			1
following that @entity54 moment , @entity24 has faced @entity28 10 times , losing nine , drawing one and conceding 33 goals			1
like @entity66 and a major golf tournament , @entity69 ronaldo and the @entity70 , @entity28 are the sharpest thorn , digging into the goalkeeper 's side			1
@entity24 joined @entity13 in the summer of 2014 and is looking to improve his record against @entity28 @entity24 comes up against @entity75 in 2012 while playing for former club @entity48 back in october , leading 1 - 0 , perhaps he allowed himself to dream			1
but by the end it was 3 - 1 going on 6 - 1			0
it 's important to be clear , in not one of @entity28 's goals — @entity82 's penalty , @entity84 's thunderous header , @entity86 's blitzkrieg counter-attack third — did the @entity87 carry any blame			1
but here he is , guardian of a team expected to win — able to make a decisive statement about taking the title back , at a time when they are in the last eight of the @entity70 and @entity96 finalists			0
his mind must have wandered to ... what if ? he 's already admitted : ' it 's true , we do talk about the @entity101 ... it 's an achievement which was in this club 's recent past and it would be fantastic to repeat			0
the @entity13 no 1 ( right ) and @entity106 train in preparation for the game against @entity28 ' but thinking about it and assuming it 's going to happen are totally different things			1
' right now @entity24 is in line to win the important @entity113 for @entity115 's stingiest keeper — 16 goals conceded in 27 matches			2
but , even given that statistic , he 's yet to give , or be asked for , a display where he can definitively say : ' those three points belong to me			0
' @entity123 's star of the @entity124 admits it is still a learning process			2
' people ask you the difference of playing at @entity13 compared to another team and it ' s waiting			2
waiting with total concentration , mental preparation , staying ready despite the fact that you might not be tested , not even involved for 20 or 30 minutes at a time			0
' i tell myself that we are under attack , that at any second , including that one right then , something vital might be asked of me			0
' the match will be @entity13 's first @entity1 at the @entity22 without @entity2 in 13 years just under 105 metres away from him for most of the night will be someone who would have nodded , with a knowing grin , at all of those sentiments			1
this is n't the first time that some have reckoned that @entity148 is facing his final @entity1 ( and who knows whether the two sides might yet meet in the @entity70 ) — but neither @entity151 nor the club 's transfer market planners are on his side			2
if @entity28 president @entity156 has his way , this will be @entity159 's fixture next season			2
but , right now , it 's @entity148 's			0
the 4 - 3 loss to @entity162 at the @entity163 12 days ago was the match which made all @entity13 fans say : ' three points on march 22 , for sure			2
' @entity2 ( right ) joined @entity167 this season where he is currently no 2 behind @entity159 but that 's not so			1
@entity148 was correctly blamed for at least two of those goals			0
but the impression that the game , and it 's embarrassing defending , was definitive was false , i think			0
@entity148 ' desire , his cat - like alacrity seem diminished			0
but he 's a feisty , cold - minded competitor and this matters the world to him			0
thirty - seven times he ' s played @entity13 , far more than any other rival			1
if this is his last , and he 'd like there to be another six or seven before leaving in 2017 , then he 'll be determined to produce another save like the one which turned last october 's clash			0
losing 1 - 0 to @entity190 's opener , @entity148 made a point - blank save from @entity75 ( who 's scored 18 times past the @entity193 )			2
@entity28 were n't 2 - 0 down at home , @entity28 pressed the accelerator and crushed @entity197 's side in ' @entity198 's ' first @entity1 as a coach			1
it 's an anecdote that @entity148 ' first @entity1 at the @entity22 , nearly 15 years ago , also saw the first goal he conceded to @entity13 — scored by that same @entity198			1
when the world watches this contest it will be in anticipation of another of the three - plus goal games we 've seen over the last 10 years			0
but spare a thought for the @entity210 debutant in one goal , and the legend in the other			0
different lives , different men			0
