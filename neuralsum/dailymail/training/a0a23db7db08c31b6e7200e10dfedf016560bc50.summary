villagers were urged to stay indoors after 15,000 deadly @entity2 crocodiles escaped from a farm in @entity4			1
the reptiles , which can grow to 16ft long , were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby @entity8 river flood			1
bosses at the @entity10 in the north - east of the country opened the gates to the animals ’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out			1
leaping lizards : 15,000 crocodiles are on the lose in @entity4 after escaping from a crocodile farm ( file picture ) the reptiles have since been spotted all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and wildlife experts have urged local people to avoid the animals and stay indoors			1
the @entity2 crocodile is the largest crocodile in @entity4 and the second - largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile			1
prey consists of gazelles , antelope , waterbuck , sitatunga , lechwe , wildebeest , zebras , warthogs , giraffes and @entity41 buffalos			0
they are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens , goats , sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans			1
males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old , mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more			0
they are found in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity4 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66			0
isolated populations also exist in @entity68 and in @entity69			0
as the flood waters fell , many have been found trapped in the branches of trees			1
but at least one has been spotted on a nearby school 's waterlogged rugby field			1
@entity10 's @entity76 told @entity4 's @entity80 language @entity78 newspaper that he recaptures the animals whenever he is alerted to one			0
he said he had already caught ' a few thousand ' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm , but he told the newspaper that ' more than half ' of his reptiles are still missing			0
mr @entity76 said he prefers to catch the reptiles at night , as their eyes reflect red in torchlight and they are therefore easier to find			0
@entity92 are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long			0
they can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph			0
they are extremely dangerous to humans			1
their preferred method of killing is to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it , alive , underwater to drown it			0
commercial crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin , which is used to make crocodile leather for items such as belts , shoes and handbags			2
there is also a small market for crocodile meat , but most often the dead reptile 's is fed to other crocs as the species is cannibalistic			2
the commercial crocodile farming industry is small , but growing , in @entity4 , where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around 500,000 animals			2
danger : animal safety experts have warned local people to remain indoors and not to approach the reptiles because the quality of the skin is paramount , some farms keep each crocodile in its own , battery - style pen so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals			2
however this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens .			2

farmers were forced to open pens as flood water rose
one crocodile has been discovered *lurking* on a school rugby pitch
