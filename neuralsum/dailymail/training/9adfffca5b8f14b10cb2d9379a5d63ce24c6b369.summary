by @entity0 @entity4 sport will show it is on its way back at the @entity7 after a disastrous showing at @entity9 , @entity2 100m hurdles champion @entity10 has warned			1
@entity4 could only finish a lowly 10th - seven places below @entity12 - in the medals table at the last @entity2 as @entity14 won one of the mere seven golds her country took back home			1
the green and gold of @entity4 has , however , topped every medals table at the @entity21 since 1986 , when @entity22 last hosted the @entity7			1
star : @entity10 won gold in the 100m hurdles at the @entity9 for @entity4 comeback : @entity14 insists that @entity4 sport is on the up and they can top the medal table in @entity30 the last time @entity31 topped the @entity7 medals table was 1986			1
@entity4 have led the way since , so is this the time for @entity31 to get back on top ? 2010 @entity7 in @entity36 1st : @entity4 - 74 gold , 55 silver , 48 bronze ( total 177 ) 3rd : @entity31 - 37 gold , 59 silver , 46 bronze ( total 142 ) 2006 @entity7 in @entity43 1st : @entity4 - 84 gold , 69 silver , 69 bronze ( total 222 ) 2nd : @entity31 - 36 gold , 40 silver , 34 bronze ( total 110 ) 2002 @entity7 in @entity50 1st : @entity4 - 82 gold , 62 silver , 63 bronze ( total 207 ) 2nd : @entity31 - 54 gold , 51 silver , 60 bronze ( total 165 ) @entity57 do n't forget that at the @entity9 , @entity4 won just seven golds ... the same number as @entity60 ! @entity61 , @entity4 ’s chef de mission , has admitted his country will ‘ have our work cut out just to win the medal tally , let alone dominate it ’ but @entity14 , the athletics team captain , believes we will see the signs of her country ’s new generation of talent in @entity30			1
@entity14 said : ‘ do n’t tell me ( about @entity9 ) ! it was the best time of my life but it was terrible ( for @entity4 )			1
' but we have a good team this year : 103 in athletics , a lot of young and younger athletes coming through			0
it ’s going to be a good games , and we always have the swimmers - our saving grace			0
‘ a lot of our top athletes ( in track and field ) retired after the @entity88 so it was like a whole new generation to build up through to @entity91 in 2008 and on to @entity92			2
@entity94 champion : @entity14 's gold was one of just seven for @entity4 but she thinks @entity30 will be different ‘ it has been a huge building ( process ) , 14 years , to try to find new athletes and to develop them			2
but finally now we have a good crop of juniors coming through , especially because the @entity7 in 2018 are on the @entity102			0
’ other @entity2 champions have opted to skip the competition , or run only in relays , but @entity14 , 27 , has continually prioritised @entity30 , despite a year hampered by a hamstring injury and now family worries			2
@entity14 ’s mother , @entity108 , is from @entity109 and the @entity4 has been staying with her aunt and uncle in the county since june 2			2
she had been looking forward to the family travelling up to @entity30 to support her but found out on friday that her aunt was ill in intensive care			2
challenge : @entity31 's @entity117 will do battle with @entity14 in the 100m hurdles in @entity30 she said : ‘ we are a very close family so it ’s very hard at the moment			1
there are a lot of things going through my head			0
it ’s like , “ give me a break			0
let ’s get a gold medal at the @entity7 ”			0
’ @entity14 , who faces @entity31 ’s @entity117 over the 100m hurdles on @entity134 in the @entity135 on sunday , may yet double up in the 100m and hurdles in @entity30			1
she did that four years ago in @entity36 and crossed the line first in both before being disqualified from the flat sprint for a false start			0
the complaining nation , of course , just had to be @entity31			0
‘ i got over that pretty quickly , ’ said @entity14			0
‘ but i ’m desperate to run it again			0
’ emotional : @entity14 's aunt is currently in intensive care and she is determined to win for her watch the world ’s best athletes compete at @entity134 and the @entity149 for the @entity135 on sunday			1

@entity4 could only finish 10th in @entity9 medal table
@entity12 came third in @entity9 medal table , seven places ahead
@entity14 won 100m hurdles in @entity92 , just one of seven @entity4 golds
@entity4 have topped every medals table at @entity21 since 1986

@entity14 has , unlike other top athletes , prioritised the @entity21
