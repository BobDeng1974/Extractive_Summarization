tuesday night against @entity0 could be the most important @entity2 game @entity3 has ever played			1
the difference between the first and the second half was like night and day			0
when @entity3 came on , @entity2 started to play			1
having played in his position , and alongside him , it has been frustrating to see him unappreciated in this country			2
we have always had a major problem keeping the ball , but @entity3 keeps the game simple			1
that ’s exactly what we need			0
@entity17 ’s team against @entity0 looked like he had one eye on the future , but the only future @entity2 need to be focusing on is @entity21			1
if that means going with a 34 - year - old @entity3 in the heart of midfield , so be it			1
tuesday night 's friendly clash with @entity0 could prove to be @entity3 's most important @entity2 game @entity2 international @entity3 keeps the game simple but has been unappreciated in this country @entity3 congratulates @entity30 following the @entity33 wideman 's equaliser against @entity0 in @entity34 @entity35 ‘ the best player on the pitch by a mile was @entity3			1
he came on and dictated the game for us			2
’ @entity41 ( last week ) ‘ he is not a flash footballer			0
he does n’t hit @entity43 passes			0
he does n’t score lots of goals			0
but i loved playing alongside him			0
’ @entity47 ( in december ) ‘ i still think @entity3 is the best central midfield player in @entity49 football , i really do			1
i think he is the best @entity49 player in the game			2
’ even though he ’s 33 now , it ’s still not too late to start building the midfield around him			2
if i were @entity2 manager , that ’s just what i ’d do			1
look at @entity54 — he is 36 next month and has blossomed in his later years			2
his passing tore @entity2 apart at the @entity56 and he is worshipped in @entity0			1
why ca n’t we love @entity3 in the same way ? the fact he has been ignored by @entity2 for so long is a sad indictment of where we have been going wrong for so many years			1
in this country we tend to focus a lot on what players ca n’t do rather than what they can			0
we love all - action players like @entity68 and @entity69 but that ’s why men like @entity3 can be left frustrated			1
it was not long ago that defensive midfielders had to snap into every tackle			0
at @entity75 in particular , @entity3 has had to deal with ‘ @entity76 ’ — because he ’s not @entity77			1
he ’s not as mobile , he does n’t grab games in the same way and he certainly does n’t tackle like @entity77			0
but that is not his style			0
@entity77 was an amazing player but there will never be another like him and the game has evolved			2
@entity3 and @entity83 ( left ) applaud the travelling @entity2 support following tuesday 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity0 fans love all - action players like former @entity2 midfield stars @entity69 ( left ) and @entity68 @entity54 , who turns 36 next month , tore @entity2 apart with his passing at last summer 's @entity56 the best deep - lying midfielders of recent years have been passers , not pit bulls : @entity54 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			1
all of them are cultured players who look after the ball			0
and do n’t be fooled by a powerhouse like @entity99 — he can pick out any kind of pass with that left foot			0
these are n’t just defensive destroyers any more , these are the men starting the attacks			0
they may not have the best stats for goals or assists , but they are at the heart of it all			0
it ’s the same with @entity114 and @entity115 — they keep things ticking over , as does @entity3			1
he makes the passes that lead to the key pass			0
the midfield that started in @entity34 was powerful and athletic , but sometimes you need a bit of guile			1
in a way , it was a good job the first half was so poor as it meant @entity3 could come on and really show what he can do			1
friendlies might be a good time to experiment but that first half in @entity0 made for some uncomfortable viewing			1
@entity133 has had a decent season at centre back but looked awkward in midfield and @entity2 ’s passing was too slow and square			1
all of a sudden there was a different tempo to the game			0
@entity2 were fluid and found more room to move against a tough opponent			1
when he gets possession , @entity3 quickly gets the ball out of his feet and tries to slide passes forward			1
he ’s not the toughest of tacklers but he does n’t need to be			0
he reads the game brilliantly and intercepts the ball so well that he does n’t need to go charging after people			0
he has fantastic vision , which means his team - mates can get into dangerous positions			0
they know that if anyone can pick out a pass , it ’s @entity3			1
he is so comfortable on the ball and probably @entity2 ’s most two - footed player since @entity161			2
he ’s not in @entity161 ’s class , but he is so well balanced with both feet			0
@entity3 takes on midfield rival @entity164 during @entity2 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity0 at the @entity166 @entity93 and @entity99 are two of the world 's best deep - lying midfielders and both have an eye for a pass @entity3 's introduction against @entity0 changed the game , the tempo and saw @entity2 become more fluid i ’ve said it before but @entity3 has a nasty habit of passing to his own players			1
it might not look flash but he makes the game look easy			0
that ’s why so many of his team - mates love playing alongside him			0
he might be a quiet personality but you can see the effect he has on those around him			0
@entity75 have been far better with him than without him this season and @entity187 , who many thought would replace him , has been shunted out of position			0
that ’s because @entity3 is a better player in that role			2
it ’s also important to have experience in that position — i ’ve never felt it ’s one for a young player			0
@entity17 has tried @entity197 but @entity3 knows the role at club level			2
of course @entity197 could play next to him , but at present @entity3 is the best man for the job			2
considering he won his first cap against @entity203 in 2001 , it ’s amazing he has not featured more for @entity2			2
he has not always taken his chances , but now is a golden opportunity to build our midfield around him			2
it ’s still not too late to make sure @entity2 have a pass master in place for @entity21			1
@entity3 , who made his debut in 2001 ( right ) , could become @entity2 's third - longest serving player at the @entity213			1

@entity3 changed the game for @entity2 against @entity0 in @entity34
the midfielder has been unappreciated and ignored for many years
@entity3 has made just one appearance for @entity2 at a *tournament*
@entity2 should build their midfield around him for @entity21
