@entity1 's ratings were on life - support this week , with the @entity3 back in the hosting role after leaving the show in 2013			1
in spite of @entity3 bringing back @entity9 character @entity8 for a victory lap , viewership was down , tying a previous record set by @entity12 who hosted back in may			1
deadline reports that the episode , which featured musical guests @entity15 , averaged 3.8 for metered - market households and 1.8 for adults 18 - 49 , down from 3.9 and 1.9 from last week when @entity18 took on hosting duties			2
@entity3 was no worse for wear during his return to @entity36 a hiatus of more than a year			2
in addition to @entity8 , he dusted off his crotchety reporter character @entity39 and nailed an @entity41 impression			1
the @entity42 gave the episode an a- , and other outlets had praise for @entity3 taking on the duties of host			1
@entity49 breaks down the numbers , finding that other @entity1 alums have fared much better			0
@entity52 hosted the @entity54 episode , hitting a 6.3 for households , while @entity56 , hosting last season 's premiere , scored a 4.7			0
still , the best comparison might be @entity31 , who similarly to @entity3 is just beginning to develop on his own outside of @entity1			0
reunited : former castmate @entity30 and @entity61 joined @entity3 during the musical number he chose for his opening monologue spot slipping : @entity64 played a @entity65 with a limp in an opening sketch that largely failed to deliver much comedy impressionist : @entity3 flexed the muscles on some old characters , including @entity8 and @entity39 , a crotchety field reporter from @entity73 @entity36 his 4.0 during last season 's finale puts him not far out of reach			1
then again , all the worrying could be for nothing			0
@entity78 , the company that measures ratings , announced last friday that it had been getting its numbers wrong since march			0
the company blamed the errors on a software glitch , which it said mostly affected @entity83 shows by causing ratings to stay unusually high .			0
