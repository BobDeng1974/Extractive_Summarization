children as young as seven were asked by teachers to write a letter of complaint to @entity2 about their ' rubbish ' presents			1
ungrateful : children at a school in @entity23 were told to write a letter to @entity2 , complaining about their presents pupils in years three and four at @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity23 , were told to ' use adjectives ' to describe their shoddy gifts and how they felt when they tore off the wrapping paper			1
children were instructed to use ' metaphors and personification ' to get a gold award for their work , while all children were told to tell @entity2 what they expected him to do about it			1
some , including @entity44 's nine - year - old daughter summer , were told do the task as homework			2
