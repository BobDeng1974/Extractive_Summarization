by @entity0 and @entity1 a council is spending £ 10,000 on ‘ motivational ’ text messages to overweight people , telling them to ‘ walk to the shops ’ or ‘ eat slightly smaller portions ’			1
@entity2 ’s bizarre scheme sends daily texts to obese people with a short message of ‘ advice and support ’			1
they include statements such as : ‘ why not walk to the shops more often ’ , and ‘ keep a check on snacks and drinks ’			1
but the idea has been condemned by critics as ‘ a gimmick ’ that ‘ states the obvious ’			0
tackling the problem : the inspirational messages will be sent out every day to 500 participants during the 10 - week scheme ( file picture ) fat map : @entity28 in @entity29 has the highest number of hospitalisations for weight - related problems the region has been crippled with an obesity epidemic , with the local @entity35 forking out more than £ 50 million - a - year to battle the problem			1
critics of the scheme today slammed the initiative as ' ridiculous ' @entity41 , of the @entity42 ’ @entity40 said : ‘ council chiefs should n’t play nanny with taxpayers ’ money			2
it ’s difficult to see how these texts are anything other than a ridiculous waste of cash			0
’ but city councillor @entity52 said : ' we are recruiting 500 residents to take part in the 10 - week feasibility study which will see participants receive daily advice and support through their mobile phones			1
' obesity has reached epidemic levels across @entity63 , where an estimated 28 per cent of adults are obese			2
' the new text message service will offer support to adults who want to achieve and maintain a healthy weight			0
' motivation : examples of the inspirational messages people on the scheme will receive when it begins at the end of this month @entity76 practice manager @entity75 , 32 , who once tipped the scales at 23 stone before losing almost half of her bodyweight , is backing the idea			1
@entity75 commented : ' text messages would have helped me			2
' i lost weight through diet rather than exercise and if i had got something to motivate me it would have helped			0
' it stops you from losing sight of what you are trying to achieve			0
' @entity52 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , said the initiative was using tried and tested techniques from both the public and private sectors			0
he said : ' we have over 100,000 people in our region who are overweight or obese			1
' @entity102 are using the texting technique as just one part of a comprehensive set of public health activities to help and support people in changing their lifestyles , through taking more exercise and improving their diets			0
' this approach has already been used very effectively by a network of clinicians across the @entity114 in prompting people with a range of medical problems			0
epidemic : more than a quarter of residents living in @entity63 are thought to be obese headquarters : staff at @entity2 have taken on the scheme which has already been used successfully by clinicians across the country ' private sector behaviour change experts @entity127 also used this technique as part of their personal weight change programme			1
we are learning from the best in public and private sector practise			0
' it costs £ 10,000 on average to perform just one intervention operation to help people manage their weight - and the costs of obesity for the local @entity35 in terms of increased levels of disability , disease and early death are frightening - £ 50 million a year			2
