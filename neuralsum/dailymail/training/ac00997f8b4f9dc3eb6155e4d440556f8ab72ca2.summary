the 49 - year - old professional photographer told @entity1 that she bought her first camera at the age of 14 , but it was n't until three years ago when she turned her love for photography into a life long career			1
@entity13 started her professional photography career just three years ago where she captures the sense of serenity and magical moments of miniature waves ' three years ago , i was wondering what to do , so i decided to pursue my dream of being a photographer , ' she recalls			1
' my father had a great passion for photography so i guess he inspired me to turn my hobby into a passion			2
' ' i rang a couple of friends who were in the photography industry and they said to " find a niche "			0
' after taking her first photograph of a micro wave on june 10 2011 , she knew from that moment that she had unveiled her ' niche '			0
' growing up in @entity48 , i was part of a surfing association so waves started me off in my career			1
' everyone always looks at the big waves and we tend to overlook the small waves but i think the small ones provide the fine details , give the same expression and makes us all think they 're bigger than they really are in reality			1
' i decided to challenge myself by working with anything under 30 centimetres - it 's definitely taken me to where i 'm at in my career now			1
' all my photographs are taken raw , which means i do n't use any water housing ( waterproof ) because it allows me to be more flexible and gives me the best results i want			0
' so rather than just capturing frozen moments from this beautiful landscape , i have found a whole new hidden world to investigate , that of the micro or mini wave			0
when asked what her favourite photograph was , she said the ' jewel ' picture and it was also her first photograph she sold			0
' i managed to capture the 20 centimetre barrel shot which was filled with colourful glitter of jewels and i entered it in the @entity85 surf award where i was the first and only female competitor			0
' it was also my first photograph i sold to someone who i did n't know - which assured me that i was on the right path			0
' she added : ' over 3000 images are now housed in my collection with each five to 30 centimetres waves still providing its own unique moment and a beautiful insight to the treasures of mother nature			1
' ms @entity13 said she was one of the 12 photographers selected worldwide for an environment themed exhibition held in @entity102 and hopes to be in the surf exhibition on the @entity104 next year			2
@entity106 glass swirls taken in @entity107 far north coast of @entity109 describing her moments where she has captured a ' moment the naked eye misses ' the photographer said she does n't use water housing and all her photographs are taken raw			0
' this shot makes you think it was taken under water ' the delicate lines and textures capture both break and the peak of the wave allowing for the rainbow of colours to shine through another amazing shot which was taken by her raw skills - tricking us to think that it was captured underwater the colours and shape of this image reflect the perfection of the day where she captured the droplets falling off its tip just as it breaks ms @entity13 calls this the ' touchdown lick ' where she has spent a lot of time focusing to capture the waves as close to perfect as they get the condition had to be near perfect for the water to take on a glass sculpture appearance a ' chunky lip ' forming a mountain of water where in reality it was a 15 centimetre wave kaleidoscope of colours caught in the early hours one morning			2
submerged in three foot of water , crouched in anticipation as the 10 centimetre wave formed into a tongue as if trying to reconnect with the ocean a glass sculpture created by the backwash of a forming miniature wave small bait fish swimming through the 15 centimetre waves looking through the belly of a 15 centimetre wave , which was taken with no waterhousing this was taken at only 8 centimetre tall of the perfect barrell rolling through on the shoreline overcast conditions aided the metalic effect of this 8 centimetre wave as it curled itself back into the ocean this would be one of the smallest barrells the photographer has captured , being of 5 centimetre in size , coloured by dirty waters from rain @entity178 subtley shimmered one evening over the ocean , creating a metalic effect when with five centimetre wave curled			2
the photographer said she was on her knees , water to her waist , using no water housing as she captured this the full midday sun beaming through the top of this 10 centimetre wave , which highlighted the exotic colours on show			0
@entity192 said : ' i was waste deep in water with no water housing as this glass formation touched down			0
. ' submerged two foot in water without water housing , slightly crouched in anticipation of what the approaching wave was going to do , as this 15 centimetre wave started to curl its way into the shoreline as she was able to capture the inner beauty as this 15 centimetre wave crashes to shore , it presents itself as a main of hair with each strand being branded by a glow of the morning sun laying flat on the sand , a foot from the forming face of the wave with no water housing			2
ms @entity13 said : ' i was able to capture the reflection of this 10 centimetre of wave tanned by the flood waters passing down river with the morning sun providing the perfect lighting the morning sun gleaming on the top of the water creating a motlen silver effect of this 10 centimetre wave while submerged in 3 foot of water meet the photographer behind the inspiring and intricate work behind miniature waves @entity13 takes all her intricate miniature waves with her raw @entity85 camera - no waterproof cameras or equipment involved ms @entity13 was one of 12 photographers in the world to be selected for an environmental photography exhibition in @entity102 she said : ' the ocean gives me a sense of serenity and provides me magical moments to capture '			1
