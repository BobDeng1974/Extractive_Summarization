by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 16 july 2013 new research has discovered that volcanoes can sometimes ' scream ' at ever - higher pitches just before they erupt			1
scientists at the @entity5 analysed an eruption sequence at @entity8 's @entity7 and found what they describe as audible ' screams ' that followed seismic activity as the changed from steady pulses to rapid tremors			1
the researchers also believe that this research and the rise in the frequency of earthquakes and the tremors they cause in the ground could be used to predict future volcanic eruptions			1
scroll down for audio clip some volcanoes ' scream ' at ever - higher pitches before they erupt , scientists claim			1
@entity27 researchers believe a rise in the frequency of earthquakes could predict volcanic eruptions			1
they analysed an eruption sequence at @entity8 's @entity7 in march 2009 ( pictured ) the study said that it is not unusual for swarms of small earthquakes to precede a volcanic eruption			2
they can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a ' harmonic tremor ' that is inaudible to humans as it is such a low frequency			2
the researchers analysed an eruption sequence at @entity8 ’s @entity7 in march 2009			0
they found that the harmonic tremor rose to substantially higher frequencies and then stopped abruptly just before six of the eruptions			2
@entity49 , a doctoral student at @entity5 , said : ' the frequency of this tremor is unusually high for a volcano , and it ’s not easily explained by many of the accepted theories			1
' the activity hints at a volcano 's pressure before an explosion , she said			0
the findings of the study , published in the @entity62 , could help scientists to better understand what happens during eruptive cycles in volcanoes			2
however , the source of earthquakes and harmonic tremor is not known			2
earthquakes can reach a point of such rapid succession that they create a signal called a harmonic tremor , which reaches steadily higher frequencies and then stops abruptly before volcano eruptions			1
the spectacular explosion of the @entity79 is pictured some volcanoes emit sound when magma resonates as it pushes up through thin cracks in the @entity85 ’s crust			0
but the scientists think that in this case the earthquakes and harmonic tremors happen as magma is forced through a narrow channel under great pressure into the heart of the mountain			1
they believe that the thick magma sticks to the rock surface inside the channel until the pressure is enough to move it higher , where it sticks until the pressure moves it again			0
each of these sudden movements leads to a small earthquake up to 1.5 on the @entity107			0
as the pressure builds and the quakes get smaller but more frequent , they blend into a continuous harmonic tremor			0
ms @entity49 said : ' because there ’s less time between each earthquake , there ’s not enough time to build up enough pressure for a bigger one			0
' after the frequency glides up to a ridiculously high frequency , it pauses and then it explodes			0
' she believes that the pause in noise is when the earthquakes can not keep up any more and the two sides of the fault slide smoothly against each other			2
the scientists documented the rising tremor frequency , starting at about one hertz , which reached around 30 hertz			1
scientists think the harmonic tremor they studied was caused by pressure building up in channels at the heart of the mountain			1
this caused earthquakes that blended into a continuous harmonic tremor which eventually lead to an explosion			1
a lava flow in the @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity79 is pictured while humans can not hear most of the noise , she said that a person lying on the ground directly above the magma channel might be able to hear the harmonic tremor when it reaches its highest point			0
this , however , is probably not advisable , since the highest - pitched tremor is followed by an explosion			0
scientists at the @entity157 @entity156 have dubbed the highest - frequency harmonic tremor at @entity7 ' the screams ' because they reach such high pitch compared with a one to five hertz starting point			1
ms @entity49 created a 10 second recording of 10 minutes of seismic activity sound and harmonic tremor , which she sped up 60 times			0
a one minute recording that condenses an hour of activity includes a staggering 1,600 small earthquakes			0
the next step in the scientist 's research is to understand why the stresses become so high .			0

@entity27 scientists have discovered that some volcanoes ' scream ' just before they erupt
the noise is created by a tremor caused by a swarm of mini earthquakes that precedes this eruption
the @entity5 believe that a rise in the frequency of earthquakes could be used to predict when eruptions will happen
