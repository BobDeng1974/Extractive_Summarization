a couple who were tied to a large mortgage decided to downsize their home by creating their own tiny house on wheels costing just $ 33,000 ( £ 19,600 )			1
@entity7 and @entity8 from @entity9 were tired by the fact their lives revolved around monthly payments to the bank			1
so they decided to opt out of the rat race			0
the pair both have backgrounds in construction and wanted a place that would feel like a real home , but more importantly be mortgage free			2
and that 's when they came up with the idea of @entity27 , a tiny house on wheels , but which looks like a stylish abode both on the outside and in , and comes complete with high end appliances and furniture			0
mrs @entity8 , 43 , explained : ' it took us four months to build and cost $ 22,000 ( £ 13,000 ) , $ 33,000 ( £ 19,600 ) if we include the high end appliances , cabinetry , furniture , and fixtures			1
' we are now debt free , off grid , joyful , closer as a family , and enjoying living our lives full time in @entity27			2
' mrs @entity8 adds that the house allows herself and husband @entity7 , 41 , to have a grown up living space , while daughter @entity47 , 14 , has her own cabin nearby			1
the couple also have a 17 - year - old son called @entity52 who attends college			0
as well as having no mortgage payments , their heating and cooling bills are significantly lower , due to the massive reduction in square footage to their home			0
but because the home is built on a trailer , it is not recognised by building codes , meaning building permits are almost impossible to obtain			0
