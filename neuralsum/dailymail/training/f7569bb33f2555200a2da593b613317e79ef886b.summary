but @entity28 , who won their group ahead of @entity5 , will not be a pushover and could cause the out - of - form @entity49 problems , particularly in @entity30			1
@entity51 and his @entity4 team - mates were dumped out of the @entity17 early on @entity54 - @entity53 former @entity55 and @entity56 striker @entity53 has been in excellent form for @entity28 since swapping @entity58 for @entity59 last summer			1

considering the @entity6 could have drawn @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , facing the @entity22 side gives @entity82 's men a fantastic chance of reaching the last 16			2
@entity6 boss @entity82 will be pleased with his side 's draw against @entity23 of @entity22 @entity54 - @entity86 with five goals in six @entity0 group games , @entity86 will pose the biggest threat to @entity6 's chances of advancing further in the competition			1

@entity23 striker @entity86 ( right ) will be keen to continue his form in the @entity0 @entity5 vs @entity20 will @entity5 be happy with the draw ? not really			1
the trip to @entity105 will be tough , particularly given the hostile atmosphere created at the @entity107			0
@entity5 could have faced @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , all of which would 've been easier ties on paper			0
@entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 ( @entity117 ) can expect a trip to @entity119 in february @entity54 - @entity120 heavily linked with the likes of @entity123 and @entity124 last summer , @entity121 has continued to impress for the @entity21 outfit this season			0

the first - leg at @entity138 on february 19 will be their first ever meeting			0
@entity7 vs @entity24 will @entity7 be happy with the draw ? it could ’ve been a lot worse for @entity7 , but they wo n’t be overly confident of upsetting the odds against one of @entity147 ’s biggest names , even if @entity24 have fallen on tough times recently			2
@entity7 are drawn to play @entity24 during the @entity0 last 32 draw in @entity2 , @entity22 , on monday @entity54 - @entity150 it ’s coming to something when your goalkeeper is a definite star man , but @entity150 is the only player to consistently put in decent performances and who genuinely could earn a move elsewhere			1
have they met before ? @entity7 ’s greatest night in their history came against @entity24 back in 1967			2
the @entity161 defeat the @entity21 giants 2 - 1 in the @entity27 final on an evening to have gone down in folklaw			0
