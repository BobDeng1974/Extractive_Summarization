thankfully the umpire did not have to ask for ' new balls , please ' after this uncomfortable incident at the @entity3 on thursday in @entity4			0
instead of a line judge calling ' out ! ' , it was a case of shouting ' ouch ! ' after a ferocious serve from @entity8 's @entity7 hit a stunned ball boy right where it hurts			1
the unfortunate ball boy got in the way of @entity7 's 200km/h serve during the first set of his match with @entity18 @entity17 , and had no chance of getting out of the way before it thumped into the tenderest of regions			1
but he soon got down on one knee to get his breath back as a worried @entity7 then walked down the court to make sure he was all right			2
the umpire and players stood around the teenager giving words of encouragement , but they could do little to ease his pain			0
a worried @entity7 of @entity8 can only look on and hope that the ball boy is ok after the incident @entity7 and his opponent @entity17 of @entity18 try to comfort the injured ball boy minutes later he was forced from the court as an anxious @entity7 walked along with him			1
ironically it was n't the only retirement of the match as @entity7 moved into the third round after @entity17 called it quits in the fourth set , despite leading two sets to one			2
at least in the poor ball boy 's case he probably had a much stronger reason not to play on			0
in the end the ball boy is accompanied from the court by the the umpire and @entity7			0

the unfortunate ball boy got in the way of @entity7 's serve during the first set of his third round match with @entity18 @entity17
grimacing in pain the ball boy bent down to try and get his breath back , but could n't
@entity7 and @entity17 walked over to the *stricken* ball boy and gave some words of encouragement
despite *initially* trying to *soldier* on he *eventually* was forced to leave the court
