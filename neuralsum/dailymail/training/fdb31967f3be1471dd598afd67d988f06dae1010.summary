more than three decades after a bomb ripped through the crowd at @entity6 's world famous @entity4 killing 13 people , @entity1 prosecutors have reopened the investigation into the deadly far - right terrorist attack			1
prompted by fresh evidence from a previously unknown female witness , investigators are hoping to shed a new light on the 1980 explosion that also injured 200 revellers at the popular beer festival			1
intriguingly , they said it may point to previously unknown co-conspirators who may have worked alongside neo-nazi bomber @entity19 , a 21 - year - old student , who died during the attack			1
three covered bodies after the bomb attack on the popular @entity1 beer festival			0
fresh evidence from a new witness may suggest that @entity19 had co-conspiators who helped him with the attack the new witness said that within hours of the attack she found fliers hailing @entity19 as a ' hero of the right ' at a home she was teaching at in @entity33			1
according to a lawyer she spoke to , she told police at the time but they did not follow up however , chief prosecutor @entity37 said the investigation would not be limited to the woman 's evidence alone , adding that they ' will pursue all leads ... anew and comprehensively ' ' there is no statute of limitations on murder , ' he said			2
detonated in a bin by one of the festival 's exit points at the height of the friday night rush , the improvised explosive made from a hand grenade packed with nails cut a devastating path through the happy drinkers			0
@entity19 , described by @entity1 media at the time as a loner and a gun nut , was known to be a supporter of a @entity62 paramilitary group called the @entity63			1
the extreme right - wing militia named after its leader @entity65 , was banned by the @entity1 government			0
but while the original investigation said their had been indications that others had been involved , prosecutors could find no conclusive evidence to prove this before it was shut down in 1982			2
nonetheless , many victims , local politicians and lawyers have questioned the ' lone attacker ' theory			0
among them was lawyer , @entity79 who told the @entity80 that the case was reopened because of a call he had received from the new witness in september			0
declining to name her , he told the paper that just hours after the bombing she found fliers lauding @entity19 as a ' hero of the right ' in a home where she was teaching in @entity33 , a region of central @entity91 located mostly in @entity92			2
she had told police at the time but they had not followed up her claims , he said , adding that he had heard a similar story from three or four men who were among the injured			0
those witnesses said they had seen @entity19 arguing with other people before the bomb went off			1
the bombing was the worst terrorist act attributed to the right wing in @entity1 after 1945 , although throughout the 1970s and 1980s @entity1 saw several far - left terrorist attacks including the murder of prominent public figures and hijackings .			0

ripping through the crowd the explosion killed 13 and injured around 200
student bomber @entity19 , 21 , was among the dead
for years people have claimed that he was not working alone
new evidence from a female witness could now prove this
