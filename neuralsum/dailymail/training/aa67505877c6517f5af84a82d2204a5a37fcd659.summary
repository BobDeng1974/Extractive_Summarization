by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 new light can be shed today on one of @entity5 ’s mysteries of 2014 — @entity7 ’s supposed cry during his quarter - final exit referring to something ‘ five minutes ’ before the match started			1
credible sources close to those in the @entity7 camp , at whom it was directed , have told @entity16 that the two courtside photographers who initially reported this slightly misheard what was shouted			1
what he actually declared was ‘ forty - five minutes before the match ’ ( expletive deleted )			1
it is a significant difference that could explain a lot			0
at that time @entity7 would presumably have been sitting quietly in the locker room getting his equipment together			2
all contact and preparation with his team would have been done and dusted			0
however , 45 minutes beforehand he is likely to have been going through tactics and points to remember with his coaches @entity51 and @entity53			1
it is said that his cry of frustration was connected with a matter associated to that , possibly an instruction about his serve and ball toss			1
it was therefore no more than the usual outburst of annoyance about something random that @entity7 often delivers at his bench			2
seasoned observers of the @entity68 no 1 are used to witnessing this sort of thing around the world			0
the habit was largely curtailed when @entity73 was present and has generally been seen less at @entity5 than anywhere else			2
while there is a danger of reading far too much into this one incident , it does highlight the current issues with his coaching team			0
another day has passed without any announcement of how he plans to proceed with @entity51			0
back to the drawing board : @entity7 's coach @entity51 looks on as her player lost in straight sets @entity7 is still figuring out exactly how it will work long - term with the @entity90 former champion , with whom he met last thursday before she went away on holiday			1
he needs to assess how she will fit in with long - serving staff like @entity94 and @entity95 , who have expressed unease at the situation			0
meanwhile , @entity99 , whose bizarre behaviour in the doubles was another mysterious @entity5 occurrence , has recovered from her ‘ viral illness ’ and is still entered into this week ’s @entity104 in @entity105			0
it is unclear whether she will be accompanied by coach @entity107 , who is said to have ended the personal side of their relationship just prior to @entity5			0
where do you go from here ? @entity7 must decide on how he moves forward after @entity5 frustrated ? @entity7 must decide whether he continues with @entity51 after unsuccessfully defending his @entity5 title at @entity115 with her as his main coach			1

@entity7 shouted ' forty - five minutes before the match ' - not ' f *************************** *************************** *************************** ing five minutes before the match '
@entity7 was *dumped* out of @entity5 during said match by @entity27 in straight sets
@entity7 is likely to have been going through tactics 45 minutes beforehand
outcry was possibly linked to an instruction about his serve and ball toss
