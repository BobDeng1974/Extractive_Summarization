@entity0 and @entity2 defender @entity1 talks to @entity3 about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life			1
who is your sporting hero ? my brother , @entity13			1
you always want to do what your big brother does			1
he started out with @entity17 and had spells at @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity13 encouraged me to chase my dream and became my idol			1
what would you have been if you were not a sportsman ? i think i ’d have always been in sports			2
if i had n’t been a footballer , i ’d have wanted to be a golfer			2
in reality , i ’d probably be a pe teacher			2
i could n’t work in an office			2
that would send me stir crazy			2
@entity0 centre - back @entity1 says he would have been a pe teacher if he had n't become a footballer the @entity2 defender picks out brother @entity13 as his role model when he was younger what was the best moment of your career ? i ’ve got a few ; my @entity0 debut , my first cap and goal for @entity2 , but i have to choose my debut for @entity42 against @entity43 ( may 2000 )			1
i came on as a substitute in a 2 - 2 draw and knew then i had a chance of making it			2
and the worst ... rupturing my cruciate ligament against @entity17 in april 2009 and i missed the @entity51 final against @entity52 because of it			0
sitting in a suit at @entity55 in sweltering heat with my knee in a brace was torture			0
rupturing his knee ligaments and missing the 2009 fa cup final is @entity1 's worst career moment if your house was burning down , what would be the one possession you would save ? as long as my wife , @entity70 , and kids , @entity72 and @entity73 , were safe , all i ’d be bothered about is my dog , @entity75			1
he ’s a fearsome shih tzu , disguised as a little ball of fluff			0
three favourite songs on your @entity80 ? i ’m not a big music fan			0
i ’ll have @entity82 on when i ’m on the way into work but i tend to use my time in the car to give my @entity86 or my mates a safe , hands - free call			0
what was the best book you 've read ? i ’m not a big reader , either , but i ’ve just completed my team - mate @entity94 ’s autobiography			0
@entity94 's ( right ) autobiography was the last book that @entity1 can remember reading what 's your @entity99 ? i wanted to do @entity101 as my initiation song when i joined @entity0 but got stitched up			1
i told @entity103 about it but he told @entity94 , who got up and sang it before me			0
i ended up doing an impromptu version of @entity107			0
i think i pulled it off			0
@entity109 ? yep , i ’m not bad			0
if i can chuck it in a pan and stir it around , i ’m fine			0
you wo n’t catch me going for any fancy ingredients or adding garlic to everything , mind			0
in a film of your life , @entity120 would play you ? if we are going @entity124 — and why not ? — i ’d say someone like @entity126 , @entity127 or @entity128			0
@entity1 can imagine himself being played by @entity126 star @entity126 in a movie of his life @entity131 ... i still get called ‘ @entity132 ’			1
it ’s well known i had a great relationship with @entity135 but he used to come into training and ask in front of the lads whether his wife , @entity139 , had cooked my scrambled eggs properly that morning			1
i went along with it for the banter but that ’s where the nickname came from			1
i can categorically say , however , mrs @entity146 never made my breakfast ! @entity1 earned the nickname ' @entity132 ' after his close relationship with @entity150 manager @entity146			1
