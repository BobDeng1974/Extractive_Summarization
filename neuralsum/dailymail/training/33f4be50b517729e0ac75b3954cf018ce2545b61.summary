@entity1 jets were caught in a near - miss above a busy city centre when pilots commanding the flights became ' startled ' by two other aircraft flying above them			1
two @entity8 fighter jets were performing a training flight in july when two @entity10 some 500ft beneath them began their climb			1
pilots were forced to divert from their path to avoid collision above @entity15 , a report into the incident revealed			1

above , two @entity20 on a combat mission to northern @entity22 pilots were forced to divert from their original path to avoid collision over @entity15 in the july incident the mishap occurred after the @entity10 completed a training exercise at @entity28 in @entity29			1
above @entity33 , the @entity32 came into pilots ' sight , with just two to three nautical miles separating the two formations , the @entity31 report found			2
while the @entity39 pilots knew the @entity32 had been flying in the same airspace , they were told by air traffic controllers that the aircraft had begun their own climb			1
' the pilot reported that having been told that the @entity32 were climbing , he had expected the separation between them to increase , ' the report concluded			2
' he noted that under a traffic service the controllers were not required to achieve deconfliction minima and that separation was the pilots ’ responsibility , and that in this case , had he not elected to level off they would have climbed straight through the @entity8 ’s level			0
' although 500ft vertical separation would be considered sufficient in many circumstances , the @entity31 considered that because the @entity39 crew were not expecting to see the @entity32 only 500ft above them , they were probably startled by their proximity			2
' the report concluded the mishap may have been the result of information being given to pilots via air traffic in a different format than is usual			2
above , two hawk jets of the @entity68 the confusion , it was said , could have been the result of air traffic information being given in an unfamiliar @entity74 format			0

' we welcome the recommendations made in the report and will use the lessons learnt from this incident to do whatever we can to prevent it from happening again			0
