with @entity3 's straight brown hair and @entity5 's curly ginger mane , the teasing the @entity1 brothers got from their friends was rather predictable			1
less predictable , however , was @entity3 's response to it			2
after putting up with endless jokes about the boys having different fathers , 17 - year - old @entity3 settled the matter once and for all – by designing his very own dna testing machine			1
@entity1 , 17 , ( right ) built a dna testing machine in his bedroom to establish why his brother , @entity5 , 14 , ( left ) is ginger the budding scientist used it to analyse @entity5 's dna , proving that the 14 - year - old had the genetic mutation which gives a person ginger hair			1
and as well as silencing his friends , @entity3 's ingenuity earned him a top engineering prize – and a place to study biochemistry at @entity29			2
he said : ' after years of jokes from my friends saying me and @entity5 have different dads , i built the machine to test once and for all why my brother is ginger and i 'm not			1
' the theory is that red hair appears in people with a mutated gene			1
they have two copies of a recessive gene which causes a mutation in the @entity46 protein in @entity14			0
' i built the machine so i could put that theory to the test and see for myself if @entity5 has that mutation , which would explain why @entity5 has ginger hair			1
' @entity3 built the machine from items he found around his house , including an old video player the machine , known as a @entity58 machine , cost @entity3 just £ 250 to build - compared to the £ 3,000 he would have had to fork out for a new one @entity3 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , spent a year and £ 400 building the polymerase chain reaction machine , one component of which was an old video player he found at home			1
he got the idea after reading about a similar one built by a man in @entity68			0
@entity3 describes the device , which would cost £ 3,000 to buy new , as a ' dna photocopier '			2
it amplifies the dna strands so they can be analysed in a lab. once he had built the machine , @entity3 collected cells from the inside of his brother 's cheek with a swab , then released the @entity14 from these cells by heating them to @entity82 in a solution next , the dna was added to an enzyme and a primer and put in the machine for a two - hour cycle			1
finally he sent the sample to a lab. analysis there showed that @entity5 's dna did have the ginger mutation in its sequencing code			2
@entity3 fitted in his work on the machine alongside studying for a-levels in biology , maths , further maths , physics and chemistry			2
he has now been named @entity102 @entity101 , with celebrity judge @entity103 praising him for his ' outstanding project '			1
the bright pupil credits his mother @entity106 , a 49 - year - old account manager , and father @entity108 , a 50 - year - old self - employed businessman , with fuelling his enthusiasm for science as a child			0
scientists were so impressed that they named @entity3 the @entity102 's @entity101 speaking about his award winning invention , @entity1 described it as a ' dna photocopier '			1
he explained that his first task was to extract buccal cells from his brother 's cheek which he did by getting @entity5 to swirl saltwater around his mouth and spit it out			2
he then added various chemicals and put it into the centrifuge of his machine			0
he said : ' when you spin it really fast in this tiny tube all the cells collect in the bottom in what is called a pellet of cells			0
' after taking it out and putting a solution in i heat the tube to 95 degrees centigrade , further breaking down the cells and releasing the dna into the solution			0
' there is a further centrifuge step which essentially removes broken bits of the cells that do n't contain dna , they go to the bottom of the solution			0
' in an even smaller tube you put the solution , that has just got dna in it , into the machine along with an enzyme and a primer and set the machine to go through the cycle			0
' the cycle takes two hours and after , while there is nothing you can see because @entity14 is transparent , there is more dna than you started with - you have effectively amplified the dna			0
' it is a dna photocopier , amplifying the dna you have to see what you 've got			0
' if you start with one copy you will end up with a billion copies after approximately 30 cycles ( the two hour process )			0
' once the cycle is finished you have two options depending on what gene you are targeting - sequencing and electrophoresis			0
' to identify my brother 's mutation i opted for sequencing which i could n't do at home so i had to send the sample to a lab. ' the sequencing gives you a genetic code of @entity178 , @entity179			2
the ginger mutation is just one letter different in the code , called an @entity183 , and when i sent @entity5 's sample away it was identified			0
' i already knew what i was looking for because you can look up the genome on the internet so when i got my sample back i could see the mutation that causes @entity5 's ginger hair			1
' @entity3 was able to use the machine to prove that @entity5 has the genetic mutation that causes ginger hair @entity3 will now go to @entity29 to study biochemistry			1

@entity1 , 17 , from @entity62 built a dna testing machine in his bedroom
built the polymerase chain reaction machine from items he found at home
*wanted* to see if his brother had the mutated gene that causes ginger hair
*experiment* was a *success* and proved why his brother is ginger and he is n't
@entity3 was named the @entity102 's @entity101 for his design
