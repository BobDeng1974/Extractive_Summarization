for a lot of people their car is their pride and joy - but how many of us would splash out £ 250,000 on keeping it off the roadside ? a double garage has sold in @entity10 for over a quarter of a million pounds - nearly £ 100,000 more than the national average cost of a house			1
according to the latest @entity16 figures the average @entity14 home costs £ 169,624			0
but while many struggle to get their foot on the property ladder , one buyer has snapped up a double garage for a cool £ 251,000			1
a double garage unit in @entity10 was sold for £ 251,000 at an auction this week , putting it at a level well over the price of an average @entity14 home			1
for the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages , and there is an option of connecting to water on - site			1
the storage facilities went for more than three times the list price when they went under the hammer at a property auction in @entity10 yesterday afternoon			1
described as a ' postage stamp of land ' , the site is situated on a leafy street in @entity43 , north @entity10			2
but the new owner may have got a steal , in an area where a five bedroom house can set you back £ 6million , the land has been sold with development potential			1
however , no planning rights have been obtained yet			0
the garage is in @entity43 , @entity10 where a five bedroom property could set you back £ 6million estate agents described the site as being : ' conveniently situated with a frontage to @entity57 , in a popular residential area close to both the local shopping and travelling facilities of @entity61 and @entity43			1
' @entity63 @entity62 , of @entity64 - the estate agents who hosted the auction , said : ' this was an exceptional price and sales like this are quite rare			2
' there were two garages in @entity73 on a small plot of land 25ft two inches by 34ft in depth that were listed at £ 80,000			0
' there was a lot of interest in the room and finally they were knocked down for £ 251,000			0
' someone thinks there is development potential although we did n't sell it with any planning consent or permission			1
' it 's a modest site , but if you get planning permission you may get a house on there			2
' the previous owners , who had a portfolio of properties dotted around @entity10 , had owned the plot for 19 years			2
mr @entity62 added : ' such sales are not uncommon in @entity10 , but ones like the plot in @entity73 are rare			2
' they often come with development potential and developers will see that potential and pay large sums to secure ownership			0
' the @entity43 double garage is not the only @entity10 lock - ups with a hefty asking price			1
many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential			0
in 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in @entity118 went on the market with a whopping £ 1.25million asking price			0
but the new owner could rest assured that they would own property in the same trendy area as @entity125			0
the lock - ups which in @entity118 which , because of their trendy postcode , had a £ 1.25million asking price in 2012 a 6 - metre long garage went on the market for £ 525,000 , but that was because of its pricey postcode in @entity137 - home to @entity138 and some of the world 's richest people			1
a garage in @entity137 which went on the market for £ 525,000 in 2012 and in august this year a 224sqft @entity43 lock - up , which had been converted into a studio flat went on the market for £ 250,000			0
