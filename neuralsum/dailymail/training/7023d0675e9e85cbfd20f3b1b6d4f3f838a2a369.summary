when little @entity3 's tummy began to swell two weeks ago , her parents took her to the doctor thinking she had nothing more than wind			1
but an x-ray revealed the cause of the newborn 's distended tummy was a cancerous tumor which grew to the size of a three - pound cantaloupe within weeks			1
after a 12 - hour operation to remove the lump and most of her digestive system , the frail eight - week - old baby will need multiple organ transplants and reconstructive surgery to stay alive			1
her heartbroken parents @entity20 and @entity21 remain at her bedside at @entity24 in @entity25 , hoping their precious second child will continue to gain weight and get stronger			1

doctors planned to wait a few weeks to remove the tumor , but they brought forward the surgery when it expanded from the size of a softball to the size of a cantaloupe in weeks			1
when the huge bulge was removed , @entity3 's weight dropped from eight - and - a - half pounds to five - and - a - half pounds			1

in good news , doctors said the tumor was only five per cent cancerous and are waiting to see if cancer has spread to @entity3 's body			1
