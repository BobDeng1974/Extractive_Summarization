by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 3 may 2013 when the @entity3 refurbished its @entity4 at a cost of £ 1billion , its staff looked forward to settling into their new office space			1
but a draconian directive from bosses has made sure they do n't make themselves too comfortable			1
they have been urged not to bring in plants , kettles , microwaves , fridges or coat - stands			1
' territorial ' : @entity3 bosses have banned pot plants from the office ( file photo ) the memo said foliage could be used as a form of ' desk - grab ' to mark out territory and ' form un-collaborative barriers ' with colleagues			1
it said : ' plants give a strong sense of ownership of a particular desk or area when we would like staff to feel much more mobile and flexible across the open plan floor plates			2
' they have been used to form un-collaborative barriers between teams and individuals			0
' the email also warned : ' some people are allergic to certain plants and they also attract insects which we do n't want sharing our workplace			0
' order : staff at @entity49 were sent the memo from bosses coat - stands have been banned ' to keep the line of vision clear ' while waste paper baskets have been jettisoned in favour of ' recycling hubs '			1
many electrical appliances – such as fans , kettles and microwaves – have also been barred in case they set off fire alarms			1
yesterday one angry @entity3 worker said : ' it is totally unnecessary			1
you have to trust your own staff to make some of their own decisions			2
boiling point : kettles have also fallen foul of the @entity3 's management ' if someone wants to bring in a plant to liven up their desk , why not let them ? ' it is a typically bossy , infantilising email of the kind we have come to expect from @entity3 managers			1
' @entity48 were asked to watch a short film explaining the rules of @entity49			0
it said : ' @entity86 will have @entity87 and air conditioning as well as fully equipped catering hubs			0
' because of this there 'll be no space for your kettles , microwaves , fridges , plants , lamps , heaters or fans			2
' interior design expert @entity99 said the decision to ban pot plants was ' bizarre '			0
she said : ' research for the past 30 years has shown that plants are really beneficial to the occupants of offices and workspaces			0
' a recent study showed that lean or bare office spaces are not conducive to getting the best from employees			0
' adding decoration including plants improves productivity and when workers are empowered to take control of their workspace			0
' a @entity3 spokesman said : ' there 's no official ' ban ' on plants			2
we 'd just prefer it if people did n't bring them in			0

staff were sent draconian directive from @entity3 bosses
kettles , microwaves and coat - stands on the *blacklist*
it comes after £ 1billion refurbishment of @entity4
