by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 02:12 est , 15 august 2012 scientists are developing new theories on how man first colonised @entity4			2
they believe the first @entity4 were two separate groups - one adept at farming , and another hunter gatherers			1
they also claim the spread of farming through @entity4 was a key part of how we became modern @entity4			1
researchers say the first @entity4 fell into two main group - hunter gatherers , and farmers researchers say new analytical techniques are changing long - held , simplistic views about the evolutionary history of humans in @entity4			1
their findings indicate that many cultural , climatic , and demographic events have shaped genetic variation among modern - day @entity4 populations and that the variety of those mechanisms is more diverse than previously thought			2
recent advances in paleogenetics are providing never before seen glimpses into the complex evolution of humans in @entity4 , helping researchers piece together the events that ultimately created what is now known as modern man			0
following the period when ice sheets were at their maximum extension across the earth - between 27,000 and 16,000 years ago - hunter - gatherer populations re-colonised most parts of @entity4			2
then around 8,000 years ago , the first farming populations appeared on the continent during the so - called @entity44 transition			0
for several thousand years , two separate modes of life coexisted in @entity4 : hunter - gatherer populations continued to rely on wild food resources , while farming populations had an entirely different demographic profile and lifestyle that consisted of domesticated crops and livestock , pottery , housing , and storage technology			1
for some decades , it was assumed that the genetic diversity of contemporary @entity4 was shaped mainly during the @entity44 transition			0
early @entity4 were thought to fall into two main groups , farmers and hunter fatherers			1
new research has found the spread of farming through @entity4 was key to the evolution of the area			1
however , it now appears that it was also affected both before and after this key event			0
and the spread of farming is likely to have varied to a great extent by region , leading to varying impacts of migrating farmers ’ and local hunter - gatherers ’ genetic contributions to future populations			1
the study ’s first author doctor @entity79 , of @entity81 in @entity82 , said : ' we are currently at a stage in which next - generation sequencing technologies , ancient dna analyses , and computer simulation modelling allow us to obtain a much more accurate and detailed perspective on the nature and timing of major prehistoric processes such as the colonization of @entity4 by modern humans , the survival of human populations during the ice age , the @entity44 transition , and the rise and fall of complex societies and empires			0
' the development of inter-disciplinary approaches is crucial to elaborate realistic models of human evolution			0
' these methods and technologies hold great potential to shed new light on past genetic variation , the onset of major cultural and technological changes that left their imprint on past and present genomes , and potentially on the impact of changes in lifestyle and demography on the appearance of certain diseases and genetic disorders			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity123 .			0

farming key to the development of @entity4
two *distinct* groups of early @entity4 existed : farmers and hunter gatherers
