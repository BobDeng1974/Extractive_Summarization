by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 5 october 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 7 october 2013 @entity2 ’s victims could be offered as little as £ 1,500 each in compensation by the @entity4			1
the paltry sum is the lowest of the seven tiers of payments to victims of the @entity10 and presenter proposed by the corporation			1
it is about the same amount as the @entity4 ’s director general is paid in a single day			1
the £ 1,500 payment would be made to those who suffered a ‘ minor assault ’ at the hands of the paedophile , who preyed on youngsters in his dressing room and backstage			1
paedophile dj @entity2 's @entity4 premises victims may be paid as little as £ 1,500 in compensation the highest payment – only £ 40,000 – would go to those who were raped by @entity2			1
one of his victims , who did not want to be named , described the @entity4 proposal as ‘ pathetic ’ , adding : ‘ their top bosses get that kind of money in a few hours and they think it will compensate for a lifetime of psychological trauma ? put another couple of noughts on the end , people might be satisfied			1
’ @entity2 , who died in october 2011 aged 84 , attacked hundreds of children he met at the @entity4 and at hospitals , charity events and schools			1
police believe the @entity47 and @entity48 ’ll fix it presenter attacked at least 1,300 people over the course of 54 years			2
a year after his reign of terror was exposed the @entity56 children ’s charity is still taking calls from people he targeted			2
@entity60 says @entity2 spent ‘ every waking minute ’ thinking about abusing children , and used his celebrity status to that end			0
victims of @entity65 have attacked the @entity4 's offer of compensation , arguing the £ 1,500 figure is about the same amount as the @entity4 ¿ s director general , @entity70 , is paid in a single day about 135 victims have launched legal proceedings against the @entity4 , the @entity73 , the now - defunct @entity75 school for girls in @entity77 , and @entity79 ’s £ 4.3million estate			1
the estate has been frozen in light of the allegations			0
lawyers for all sides are due to meet in a @entity86 hearing on october 21 to discuss the compensation proposals			2
under the @entity4 scheme , victims could be paid 25 per cent extra if @entity2 repeated the abuse , and another 25 per cent if it led to lifelong trauma , it is understood			2
if the @entity4 ’s proposals are accepted , it means the broadcaster and hospitals that failed to stop the serial predator could get away with relatively low compensation payouts			1
they feared the scandal would cost them millions of pounds , but it seems likely they are facing a combined compensation bill of only two or three million pounds			2
but the meagre amounts have split opinion among victims , with some branding them an insult , and others saying no amount would compensate for what @entity2 did			0
one victim told the @entity117 : ‘ whether it is £ 100 or £ 100,000 , it does n’t matter to me – the point is to get an acknowledgment they did wrong			0
‘ so many people knew what @entity2 was like but nobody stopped him			0
there were dozens of chances for them , but they let him go on attacking children until he was an old man			0
@entity2 is dead , and this is the only way to get back at him			0
’ @entity126 said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the @entity10 ’s predatory behaviour , and believe senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed			0
the @entity56 said publicity surrounding the @entity2 case had also led to a more general surge in the number of child victims of sexual abuse making contact with them			0
the number of referrals the @entity56 helpline has made to police and social services was up by 84 per cent in june and july compared with the same period in 2012			0
the @entity4 ’s director general , @entity70 , who took up his post in the spring , is paid a salary of £ 450,000 a year , according to the @entity147			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ the parties remain in discussions			2
it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage			0

at least 450 people abused by the paedophile dj on @entity4 premises
corporation proposing seven tiers of compensation pay - outs
the lowest , for ' minor assaults ' , is proposed at £ 1,500
the highest , for those raped on @entity4 *grounds* , is £ 40,000
