it is the nation ’s newest guessing game and has even sparked gambling fever : just who is the killer in new @entity6 series @entity4			1
as armchair sleuths try to solve this murder mystery puzzle , no doubt the show ’s cast will have some sympathy			0
because even they did n’t know the answer until the very last minutes of filming			1
@entity4 tells the story of how a small community is affected by the death of a schoolboy whose body is found at the foot of a cliff			0
the cast of @entity4 , starring @entity23 , were not told the culprit until the last moments of filming it stars former doctor who @entity23 , @entity28 – who played @entity29 in the film @entity31 – and @entity32 from @entity33			1
writer @entity35 was so determined to keep the climax a surprise that he kept his cast and crew in the dark for the whole of the five - month filming schedule – prompting a wild guessing game among them			1
@entity35 said : ‘ we adopted the kind of security you ’d normally associate with a massive @entity50 movie			1
all of the scripts on set were kept in a safe , watermarked so they could n’t be copied , and there were only five people , including myself , who knew the full story			2
‘ for 85 per cent of filming , no one had any idea who was guilty			2
the cast and crew set up a rogues ’ gallery and took bets on who they thought it was , but i was determined that secrecy was the key to the drama ’s success			2
’ finally revealing the answer to ‘ whodunit ? ’ became a mini drama on its own			0
@entity35 , who also wrote the @entity78 hit @entity79 , said : ‘ as we were coming to the point where we had to give people final scripts , i organised for everyone to meet at the beach so that i could tell them			1
the first episode of @entity4 , starring @entity23 and @entity28 , attracted seven million viewers ‘ but on set the night before , so many people admitted they liked the suspense and did n’t want to know who it was , that when i arrived i told them i ’d changed my mind			1
‘ @entity28 , who plays one of the investigating police officers , looked like she was ready to murder me , while @entity23 grabbed hold of me and said he could n’t believe i was n’t going to tell him			0
but then he admitted he was actually glad			0
’ the actors were told on a ‘ need - to - know ’ basis a couple of days later in late - night phone calls just hours before they were due on set			1
attempts to keep the plot shrouded in secrecy are continuing , with the series , which started on monday , due to run for another seven episodes			1
@entity35 said : ‘ @entity32 called to say all her friends and family are putting bets on , and i ’ve heard countless similar stories in the past few days			1
‘ it seems people have become instantly caught up in the series			2
’ all preview copies of the series have been password - protected , with only a handful of people allowed access to them			1
even @entity6 ’s director of programmes , @entity120 , was kept in the dark until last week			0
writer @entity35 gathered cast on a beach to tell them the plot , but then changed his mind at the last minute @entity35 said : ‘ we are n’t even allowing the following week ’s episode to be trailed at the end of the show because it might lead to the secret being blown			1
’ the series attracted more than seven million viewers for the first episode last week			2
now it looks set to win accolades as one of this year ’s top dramas			2
the story , set around the fictional @entity141 town of @entity4 , was filmed in the county at picturesque @entity143 near @entity144			2
@entity4 is on @entity145 tomorrow at 9pm			0
the @entity143 in @entity141 was used for the cult @entity78 sitcom @entity147 , starring the late @entity148 the seaside town of @entity143 in @entity141 , where @entity4 was filmed , has been the backdrop to a string of tv dramas			0
it earned its claim to fame in the @entity156 when used for the faked suicide scenes in the opening titles of cult @entity78 sitcom @entity147 , starring the @entity161			0
then , in 1999 , the bay landed a more regular tv slot when it became @entity164 in another @entity78 series , @entity166 , starring one - time heart - throb @entity167 as a harbour master			1
in real life , the bay is a favourite for family holidays with amusement arcades , ice - cream shops and a funfair			0
but the rugged cliffs and thrashing seas are a reminder that the coastline has a more dangerous side			0
last year , 22 - year - old @entity182 was killed by a rockfall as she walked on the sands at nearby @entity185			0
some locals felt it was insensitive to use the coastline to film another tragedy , albeit fictional , so soon after her death			0
