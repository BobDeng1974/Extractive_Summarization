@entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , has spent the past 17 years trying to come to terms with the death of her son @entity16 after he was shot dead in a drive - by shooting while asleep her car in 1995			1
his killer was @entity21 , who is currently serving life without parole for the murder he committed aged just 16			1
brave : @entity11 holds a photograph of her son @entity16 , killed in a drive - by shooting in 1995 by @entity21 , right , who was 16 at the time			1
she has met him to discuss the impact his crime has had on her life but just a few weeks ago ms @entity34 decided to meet the now 33 - year - old , in a bid to complete her grieving process , becoming the first person to take part in the @entity41 pilot programme in restorative justice			1
she has now spoken about the heart - wrenching meeting , and how at the end she took hold of @entity21 's hands , praying that they ' no longer be hands of destruction '			1
the mother - of - two spent six months preparing for the visit , alongside her older son @entity52 , now 23 , who was six when the gunshots hit the car where he sat sleeping with his brother			1
part of this process was recollecting the day her son was killed , examining emotions she felt about every aspect of the crime			0
victim : @entity16 was sleeping in the car with his brother when he was shot in the head in @entity12 ms @entity34 had driven to a north east @entity12 duplex to collect her grandniece as there had been a drive - by shooting the previous night			1
but while she left her sons in the car and went indoors , a volley of 12 shots were fired at the house and car and one bullet , fired by @entity21 , hit @entity16 in the head			2
when ms @entity34 was finally ready to visit @entity21 , one day in may , she was overcome with emotion just seconds before the meeting			2
however , she recalled to the @entity79 , how , at that minute , @entity21 saw her in the doorway and rose from his chair			2
she told the newspaper : ' he dropped his head and shook it with such sorrow , as if to say , ' look at what i 've done to this woman			0
' that gave me the courage to start moving			0
' during the meeting the pair recounted the crime from their individual points of view and ms @entity34 spoke about her son , what he meant to her and her family , and at times talked with anger			0
she also revealed that she had forgiven him at his trial , after realising that his crime did not mean he was a completely bad person			0
he said that he 'd become a better man in prison			0
she added : ' and he asked me , '' why do you think @entity108 showed you who i really am and did n't show my mother or grandmother ? '' ' when the pair went to part company , @entity21 stood and extended his arms and ms @entity34 asked him to turn his palms facing up			1
she took hold of his hands and prayed , saying it was his hands which caused the harm			2
she said : ' the fact that he actually pulled the trigger , it was something about the hands that kept coming to me			0
' she added : ' i prayed that they would cause no more harm , that they 'd be hands of comfort , that they would bring help and serve people and that they would no longer be hands of destruction but hands that bring life			2
' @entity140 mr @entity52 , who also went through six months of preparation for the visit , said he took part in the process out of concern for his mother and had few memories of his brother			0
he said he was skeptical about how remorseful @entity21 would be , but said the visit proved his remorse was real			0
ms @entity34 , who has vowed to continue meeting @entity21 , she felt the need to meet @entity16 's killer after ' reaching a peak in the healing process '			1
she has received help and support through counselling and her church for the last 17 years but felt the meeting would offer her complete closure in the grieving process			0
remarkably , she thinks he deserves a second chance and said she would not be ' at peace ' if he spent the rest of his life in prison			0
she said she wanted to see him back in society , functioning as a normal adult			0
the pilot project has no impact on the defendant 's sentence but experts who met with ms @entity34 and @entity21 before and after the visit said such meetings can transform offenders and make them less of a management risk .			1
