at 42 years and 110 days old , @entity0 is hardly a fresh - faced debutant			1
but the @entity2 goalkeeper insists he feels ‘ fitter , stronger , better ’ than ever as he fights to make his first appearance for @entity4 on saturday at @entity5			1
@entity6 never gives much away about team selection , but an @entity9 tie against @entity10 may provide his new signing with some action			1
@entity13 has done an excellent job deputising for the injured @entity15 , who is still a few weeks away from fitness after breaking a metatarsal , but @entity0 is eager to play his part , following a spell at @entity20 behind two of the world ’s best in @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity0 joined @entity4 on an 18 - month deal from @entity20 in january the veteran goalkeeper had @entity23 and @entity24 ahead of him in the @entity20 pecking order ‘ i want to be judged each week , to have that pressure again , ’ he tells @entity28			1
‘ it ’s something the last six months has lacked			0
i feel very fit and ready to go			2
’ the man with 109 @entity33 caps has signed an 18 - month contract at @entity4 and should @entity6 hand him a start today , he aims to grasp it with both hands			1
were @entity0 then able to help his club stay in the top flight , he stands every chance of breaking @entity42 ’s long - held record for oldest player to appear in the @entity44			1
@entity0 attributes the freshness he feels in his forties to a switch in gym workouts five years ago , rather than any drive to play past @entity42 ’s mark of 43 years and 162 days , set when keeping goal for @entity52 in 1995			1
‘ it has been mentioned that if i play for a certain time i will break records but it ’s not something that inspires me , ’ he says			0
‘ i continue because i enjoy playing and training so much , and hopefully i ’m good enough			2
the former @entity60 keeper poses after being unveiled as a @entity4 player earlier this month @entity0 , who could become the oldest @entity44 player next year , watches from the bench ‘ that ’s why @entity4 have signed me , because they believe i ’m still good enough to perform at the highest level and contribute to the team			1
’ keep in mind march 16 , 2016			0
any @entity44 appearance beyond that for @entity0 will see @entity42 ’s record surpassed			1
a sign of @entity0 ’s longevity can be gauged by the fact he played behind @entity6 in the @entity75 team that won promotion to the @entity44 in 1997 - 98			1
‘ he was one of the best centre halves i ’ve played with , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ he is as a person and manager like he was as a player : very straight , very calm , very assuring and confident in his own ability			0
’ @entity83 , who started @entity4 ’s @entity9 win over @entity84 , was aged one when @entity0 made his debut on these shores for @entity87			1
the likes of @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 were not born as he began his career at @entity93 in @entity94 25 years ago			0
the 42 - year - old holds up the @entity4 goalkeeper shirt after being unveiled @entity0 joined @entity20 from @entity60 on a free transfer in 2013 and made 12 appearances for the club but @entity0 has plenty left in the tank , and experience to lend the @entity4 dressing room			1
‘ in the gym and in diet it ’s all changed significantly in the last five or so years , ’ he says			0
‘ that ’s why i ’m still playing , because of those changes			0
‘ i have done goalkeeping - related weights that still allow you to maintain your flexibility but also build strength and help prevent injuries			2
it ’s stuff that previously i have n’t enjoyed but i ’ve turned the corner			0
‘ i do n’t wake up with aches , i do n’t get out of bed thinking , “ gosh , i feel 42 ”			2
that ’s just a number			0
it ’s all about what you can physically do and how you play and perform			0
that ’s all i want to be judged on			0
’ @entity0 , with 508 top - flight appearances in @entity125 football , will be a vocal presence			1
‘ to be honest i talk just for the sake of talking , ’ he says , laughing			0
‘ i want to help people			0
it ’s about self - belief			2
there are going to be times when people make mistakes and it ’s not about berating them ; it ’s about trying to pick them up			2
we ’re going to have to fight as a team			0
