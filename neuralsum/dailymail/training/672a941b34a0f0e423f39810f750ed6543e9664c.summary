by @entity0 published : 03:17 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 22 october 2013 a @entity2 artist has created his own @entity4 - style @entity3 out of a humble @entity5			1
@entity7 spent three months working on his first sculpture , in which he turned the car into a real - life ' robot in disguise '			1
the rear wheels of the @entity5 have been converted into the legs and feet of the squatting transformer and the doors have been turned into long arms			2
artist @entity7 has taken a 1988 @entity5 and morphed it into a towering @entity3 @entity7 ( left ) worked with his father ( right ) on the three month project that explores identity the artist was joined on the project by his father , whose job is to convert vehicles into hearses , and his engineer brother @entity26			1
mr @entity7 said the work is more than just a reference to pop culture but explores the issues of identity , reality , fantasy and transformation			0
he said it reflects his identity as the son of an @entity39 immigrant and looks at the relationship between class , immigration and family			2
the artist , whose work is featured on his website , deliberately chose a 1988 @entity5 for the sculpture as it was the first car he drove , aged 17			2
the car 's number plate also almost perfectly spells out ' family ' , which was unintentional but ' perfect ' for the work			1
mr @entity7 said : ' born in the @entity2 to immigrant @entity39 parents , the passing of a car between 1generations provided me with my first taste of independence			1
mr @entity7 chose the @entity5 because it was his first car and the number plate is ' perfect ' because it almost spells out ' family ' ' manufactured in @entity62 , this car stands as a symbol of working class @entity2 — a native body , albeit a metal one			1
' he said , as well as reference the @entity3 franchise , the project also reflects his own family			0
as well as choosing a car that was personal to him , mr @entity7 said the squatting pose was also a deliberate choice			0
mr @entity7 wrote : ' unlike the popular toys and films , however , the car here is not a high - powered sports car or truck transformed into a powerful warrior , but rather a small , inexpensive @entity5 transformed into a human , calmly squatting			1
' this posture is a recurring image in my work and forges a link between the lower classes in @entity39 and my immigrant family in the @entity2 , both of whom sit comfortably this way			0
' naturally this introduces a tension in this sculpture between the seemingly submissive nature of the squat and , in this case , its oddly larger than life scale			0
' he said he chose the squatting position because it reflects how his father and many lower class @entity39 sit transformers were originally launched in @entity105 in 1984 and featured factions of alien robots , who can disguise themselves as cars of other electrical equipment , and struggle for peace or dominance			2
it has expanded into comic books , animation , video games and three @entity4 films , starring @entity118			0
in his work mr @entity7 has used them as a metaphor for a real life conflicts and struggles			0
he wrote : ' for me , these " robots in disguise " ( as per the cartoon ’s theme song ) stand as a metaphor for the other , in a fantasy world where they can transform out of a marginal position into one of empowerment			0

@entity7 took three months to convert vehicle into squatting @entity3
the sculpture explores his family 's @entity39 , working - class *background*
his father and brother helped on the project and the car number plate almost spells ' family '
the @entity5 transformer is on *display* at the @entity151 in @entity152 until *december* 22 .
