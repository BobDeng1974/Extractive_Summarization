by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 captain @entity2 believes ' on fire ' midfielder @entity5 can become as important a player as former skipper @entity7 was at the @entity8			1
the @entity10 international , 23 , netted a dramatic stoppage - time goal to beat managerlesss @entity12 2 - 1 on saturday as the @entity13 secured a morale - boosting victory on the opening day of the new @entity18 campaign			1
it was @entity5 's extra-time goal which won the @entity21 at @entity22 in may to end a nine - season trophy quest - and an untimely injury to the dynamic midfielder at the turn of the year which impacted on the @entity13 ' fading title challenge			1
top form : @entity5 was @entity3 's match winner at the @entity8 on saturday afternoon high praise : @entity3 club captain @entity2 believes @entity5 can be as good as @entity7 @entity32 lauds late @entity5 goal @entity2 is in no doubt of the influence @entity5 , who scored 16 goals last season , can have			1
' @entity5 is on fire			2
when you have a player like this coming from midfield to score that many goals gives you something extra , ' said @entity2 , who took over the armband full - time following @entity47 's summer departure to @entity48			1
' we do n't really have a 30 - or 40 - goal scorer at the moment , so to have players who can score goals from the middle of the park is very important			2
' he reminds me a little bit of @entity7 when he was here			0
at his best , @entity7 was coming off the front , making the final ball and scoring very important goals			0
' i think @entity5 's confidence is really high at the moment , physically he can do whatever he wants and technically he is in a very good state , so he is one of the most important players in the team			1
former team - mates : @entity5 played with @entity7 at @entity3 before the @entity67 joined @entity48 in 2011 decisive : @entity68 decided to pass up the opportunity to sign @entity7 because of @entity5 ' i think he will get better with experience , with knowledge and confidence			1
' people have a fear now with him because they know he can create things and that gives you an extra yard which is very important			0
' whatever he wants to do , he has shown in the past two seasons how much he is able to improve , so i think he can do even more			0
' such is the influence of @entity5 and his other attack - minded midfielder colleagues , which now include Â£ 30million signing @entity85 , @entity3 boss @entity68 passed up on the chance to bring their former captain back from @entity48 this summer , with @entity7 joining @entity89 rivals @entity88 instead			1
it is some transformation for the former @entity92 youngster , who recovered from an horrific double leg break at @entity94 in february 2010 to win over the critics			0
' for me , there are two factors			0
first of all , he showed great character because i remember the days when he used to come here and the people used to be against him			0
to get through that and feel the love that he feels now is very important , ' @entity2 said			2
' the manager as well backed him big time			0
if you have someone like that then you need to give something back and that 's what @entity5 is doing			2
