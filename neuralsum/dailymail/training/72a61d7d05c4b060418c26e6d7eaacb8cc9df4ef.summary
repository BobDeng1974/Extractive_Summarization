by @entity0 many people dream of winning the lottery and quitting work forever - but not rising soap star @entity4			1
instead , the chirpy real - life cockney actor insists he would n't swap his dream role as @entity8 ' newest rogue @entity9 for anything			1
' honestly , if you offered me a winning lottery ticket or the @entity8 job , i 'd choose @entity8 , ' he says			1
' what am i going to do with money ? i 'd get bored and find a job anyway			1
and i like working on something i appreciate			1
' @entity19 says that all the money in the world could n't make him leave his dream role on @entity8 @entity4 , 22 , set his sights on an acting career after taking part in a school production of @entity27 !			1
later , the working - class lad from east @entity29 took any job going while waiting for a break			1
' i had every job under the sun , ' he says			1
' on building sites , in restaurants , pubs , a flower stall , gardening - anything to earn a bit of money			2
' while his parents , who split when he was very young , wanted him to become a carpenter or plumber , @entity4 would n't be dissuaded			1
' i knew i 'd get a break because i was persistent , ' he says			2
' i was willing to wait until my 50s			2
' fortunately , he did n't have to			2
@entity4 - who says his family came up with the unusual name in a moment of bizarre spontaneity - won plaudits last year on the @entity53 stage in beautiful thing , alongside @entity55			1
then this spring he was cast as squaddie @entity9 , the on - screen son of his real - life acting hero @entity56			2
@entity9 caused a stir from the start by bedding @entity59 before her murder			2
' i grew up watching @entity59 , but never thought i 'd end up a suspect in her murder , ' he says			2
@entity4 says his first scene with @entity63 and @entity64 was pretty special and that working with a legend like @entity66 is amazing too the only person more pleased to hear that @entity4 had landed the job was his no 1 fan - mum @entity67 , who promptly burst into tears			1
this winter @entity4 will make his movie debut alongside @entity56 's teenage daughter @entity71 in @entity73 gangster flick @entity72 , and admits he ca n't believe how his life is turning out			1
' @entity8 is an amazing opportunity to learn from the greats - @entity56 , @entity76 , @entity66 , @entity77			1
i 'm happier than i 've ever been			2
' despite his success , @entity4 - who says he 'd prefer to keep his love life private - appears to have his feet on the ground			1
' i have a normal life ; friends and family treat me the same as they 've always done			0
' @entity4 is using his raised profile to fight homophobia and regularly tweets on the subject			1
' where i grew up , being gay was unheard of and at school i was prejudiced , ' he admits			0
' when i was nine or ten i gave this lad a whack because he was gay - and he battered me ! a few years later , after i 'd grown up a lot , i apologised to him - and we 've remained close friends since			0
peer pressure can change you into someone you do n't want to be , like a bully			0
i nearly became one until i was strong enough to see it was wrong			0
i was disappointed in myself but i learned from it			0
' then at drama school i was surrounded by people of all cultures and sexualities , which showed me how important it is to be true to yourself , and not care what others think			0
they taught me a lot ; the least i can do now is stand up for equal rights			0
' @entity113 or @entity114 ? @entity114 - i 'd love to see some theatre in @entity116			0
pub food or restaurant ? pub food 's great but as i 'm on a diet i 'd have a jacket potato or an omelette			0
beer or spirits ? i like ales - especially @entity126 from @entity127			0
rugby or football ? i 'm a @entity130 fan			0
i went to my first game with my dad when i was about four			0
my nan used to run a pub round the corner from their stadium			0
rock or dance music ? i love bands like @entity140 and @entity141			0
@entity142 or @entity143 ? definitely the @entity143 films - i grew up watching them .			0
