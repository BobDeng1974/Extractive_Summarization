by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today took aim at triumphant @entity5 leader @entity4 , dismissing his image as a ‘ normal bloke down the pub ’			1
the prime minister hit the airwaves after the @entity11 were pushed into third behind @entity5 and @entity13 , despite his repeated promise to hold an in - out referendum on @entity17 ’s membership of the @entity18			1
mr @entity2 said the message from voters had been ‘ absolutely received and understood ’ , but challenged the idea that mr @entity4 is anything other than a ‘ consummate politician ’			1
@entity13 had 18 meps and a 25.35 % vote share , narrowly ahead of the @entity11 with 18 meps but 24.56 per cent			1
mr @entity4 , a privately - educated @entity33 trader , has played up the idea that he is different to the other party leaders , with regular visits to pubs , including to celebrate last week ’s local elections			1
but he has faced criticism over his use of @entity42 allowances and employing his @entity44 wife @entity43 using taxpayers ’ money			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ listening to him on the radio and television over the last few days it all seems supremely tactical			1
‘ it ’s all about trying to grow votes in clusters or something in different parts of the country			2
so i do n’t really accept this thing			2
he is a consummate politician			2
‘ we have seen that with his expenses and wife on the pay roll and everything else			2
so i do n’t really accept that he ’s a normal bloke down the pub thing			1
’ @entity5 leader @entity4 celebrates last week 's local elections with a pint in a pub , but mr @entity2 dismissed him as a consummate politician eurosceptic conservative mps said the results from across @entity70 proved their point			1
@entity73 and @entity74 mp @entity72 wrote on @entity75 : ' some of us who opposed @entity78 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the @entity18 : and here we are			2
' @entity82 , the @entity83 mp , said : ' so maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about @entity70 were on to something ? ' there were fresh calls from some @entity11 for an electoral pact with @entity5 , to stop the haemorrhaging of support in key seats			1
but mr @entity2 said there would be no deal , but a renewed focus on what the @entity96 could promise voters			1
ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants ’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from @entity5			1
the new push , which could see unemployed @entity18 nationals kicked out of the country after just six months , was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the @entity5 surge in last week ’s elections			1
currently , new arrivals can not claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can			2
yesterday home secretary @entity116 confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months			0
and work and pensions secretary @entity120 told @entity121 it would be ‘ bye bye ’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the @entity124			0
however , the policy faces opposition from the @entity128 , who are yet to sign off on the idea			0
critics claimed the policy would have little impact on @entity2 ’s drive to reduce net migration below 100,000 before the next election , as it would have no effect on the tens of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work			1
and questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of unemployed @entity18 nationals being removed from the @entity124 when ministers struggle to throw out foreign criminals			0
he has pledged that if he is still prime minister after the next election he will claw powers back from @entity42 before holding an in - out vote by 2017			0
‘ people are deeply disillusioned with the @entity18 , they do n’t feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for @entity17 and they want change , ’ he told @entity150 ’s today programme			0
‘ i would say that message as far as i ’m concerned is absolutely received and understood			0
‘ what we need to do is demonstrate that we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out – by the end of 2017 in that referendum and that is now the task ahead of us			0
i think that ’s what we have got to focus on			0
’ former @entity96 leadership challenger @entity168 has called for the @entity18 referendum to be held sooner , to convince voters that the party will deliver on its promise			0
but mr @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t agree with that because i want to complete a proper renegotiation , which will improve @entity17 ’s place in @entity70 and will improve @entity70 as a whole			1
‘ i think what ’s interesting from last night ’s elections and from what @entity70 politicians are saying is that there are some like @entity181 , former president of @entity182 , who is now saying it really is time for the @entity18 to give back powers to member states			2
‘ so where i was something of a lone voice in arguing for this a year ago you can now see a number of allies			0
’ @entity96 mep @entity191 argued that if the @entity5 and @entity96 vote was combined , it would form a majority ofthe electorate and could deliver victory at a general election			1
he told @entity198 : ' if you add the @entity96 and @entity5 votes together in this country - and i know it does n't work as simply as that - a rough ballpark figure , we are something like 56 % of the total vote			1
' it would be very sad if the two right - of - centre @entity209 parties at the general election were not able to find some way , at least in marginal seats , of reaching an accommodation so that anti-referendum candidates do n't get in with a minority of votes			0
' how it would work , if it were to happen , is obviously to be determined at a more senior level than mine			0
but if personal rivalries and animosities put @entity224 in with a minority of the vote , that would reflect badly on all concerned			0
' but mr @entity2 was adamant that he would not do a deal with @entity5			1
' we do n't do pacts and deals			0
conservative candidates will stand as conservatives , fight as conservatives and i hope win as conservatives , ' he said			0
' we are not going to be doing deals and pacts			0
' but the premier ducked the question of what disciplinary action would be taken against @entity96 candidates who struck local arrangements with @entity5 , saying only : ' i do n't see any prospect of this happening			2
' from what i read in the sunday newspapers , @entity4 wants to destroy the @entity96 , not work in tandem with it			2
' i think there 's a great myth that there 's somehow some great pact or deal to be done			0
' if you want a referendum on @entity70 , if that 's the most important thing for you , there is only one party and one potential prime minister that can deliver that and that is the conservatives in government			0
@entity13 and @entity263 @entity128 do n't want that referendum , @entity5 ca n't deliver it			1
