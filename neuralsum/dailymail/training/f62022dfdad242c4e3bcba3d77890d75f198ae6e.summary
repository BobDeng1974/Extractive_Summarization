a trip to @entity1 requires willpower			2
tottering along @entity5 's vertiginous @entity4 , temptation lurks at every turn			1
@entity7 , ravishing @entity8 and that old favourite @entity9 are all en route			2
a gentle version of the seaside : @entity1 sits on @entity5 's @entity13 in charming style we resist the siren calls - and our reward is the @entity13 coast			1
this is one of the more secluded parts of @entity21 and all the better for it			2
porcelain sandy beaches , clear waters ( @entity25 boasts neither of these ) , meals for the price of an @entity29 sundowner , no @entity31 tourists - and our very own castle			1
well , a palazzo - a 17th - century grand dame called @entity34 , perched on the shoreline of @entity36			2
once favoured by the kings of @entity5 and @entity39 as a hunting lodge where they took pot - shots at wild boar and quail , it 's also the home and ancestral seat of the @entity46			1
he is an affable gentleman who welcomes guests with all the effortless style you 'd expect from an @entity5 aristo			1
he has quite a bloodline , with three popes , three saints and one king of @entity56 in the family tree			0
the exquisite palazzo does his pedigree justice			0
sweeping gravel drive , grand stone arched entrance and there you are in the courtyard of the original palace , now part of the hotel , where swags of jasmine , honeysuckle and roses scent the air			0
following a theme : two great @entity5 loves - religion and sunbathing - are visible on the town 's lovely beach a walk through the substantial gardens brings you to a wooden door leading to the hotel 's own beach , which is as pristine as the @entity84			1
@entity85 and all its ashy wonders can be admired if you 're happy to hurtle back up the winding @entity87			0
closer to @entity88 are the ruins of @entity90 , a @entity92 city dating back to the 7th century bc. it was abandoned , not because of volcanic explosions , but thanks to a spate of malarial outbreaks which saw off many of its residents			1
its wonders were only discovered some 400 years ago when the thick undergrowth concealing it was hacked away , revealing @entity105 temples			0
little wonder @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and other literary greats sought inspiration here			0
dinners out are lengthy affairs , with waiters serving endless plates of oily aubergines and wood - fired pizzas piled with mozzarella			0
even a fish and chip supper has an @entity5 flourish			1
ruined , but still ravishing : the remnants of the ancient city of @entity90 are just as majestic as @entity85 the most popular restaurant in @entity36 is the small takeaway which serves generous paper cups of fresh fried seafood through a glass hatch overlooking the beach , where the locals cheer on football - playing teenagers thrashing around on a pitch carved from the sand each evening			1
this modest place is a tonic to the glamour of the @entity4			2
a word of warning though - @entity31 vice-president @entity137 stayed recently , so it might not be too long before his fellow countrymen follow suit			0
@entity141 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity142 from @entity143 from £ 78 return			0
@entity145 ( 0207 563 7902 , www.cvvillas.com ) offers a seven - night stay in a double room at the @entity148 from £ 550 per person , @entity150 .			0

less known than the @entity4 , the @entity13 is @entity5 at its best
