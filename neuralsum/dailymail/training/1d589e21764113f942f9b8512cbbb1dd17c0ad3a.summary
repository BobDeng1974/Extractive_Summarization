by @entity0 published : 03:13 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 27 june 2012 before it got so serious : @entity5 in his now notorious bushy @entity3 wig picks up a woman in traditional @entity8 dress in @entity9 , ahead of @entity3 's earlier match against @entity11 the cheeky @entity3 fan who dropped his pants in a last - ditch bid to put off @entity17 's winning penalty scorer on sunday has himself been exposed as a millionaire city high flyer			1
@entity5 had been sitting behind the goal watching the drama unfold in an @entity3 goalkeeper 's kit and red and white bushy wig when he realised his time to represent his country had come			1
the 35 - year - old patriot stood with his trousers down and arms crossed and sternly tried to catch the eye of @entity30 at the crucial moment he stepped up to take the shot			2
speaking to the @entity34 today , he said : ' i just did it			0
i did n't think about it , it just happened in the spur of the moment			0
i was so desperate for @entity3 to win			1
' i would have done anything for them			0
' i do n't think he ( winning penalty taker @entity30 ) spotted what i was doing			0
' speaking from the gates of his luxurious five - bedroomed mansion house in leafy @entity48 , he added : ' @entity49 is a great choice as @entity3 manager			1
' i 'm a @entity52 fan as well			0
he did a great job for us and he 's got the @entity3 players playing as a team			1
' we did as well as we could			0
the team looked like they were pulling in the same direction , which was the complete opposite to @entity59			0
' this time lost on penalties and were undefeated in the tournament			0
' penalties are 90 per cent psychological and 10 per cent skill			0
' i thought @entity3 's best player was my neighbour @entity64			1
' mr @entity5 said he and a friend had to sprint from one end of @entity69 's @entity68 to the other so he could watch the dramatic spot kicks from behind the goal			1
he said his wife , @entity83 , who is eight - months pregnant with twins , watched his antics from home which she found ' very , very funny '			1

the supporter next to him appeared to also be dropping his trousers			0
the @entity3 team flew home on monday after their dramatic penalties defeat			1
but they were given a somewhat low - key homecoming after no @entity3 fans turned up at @entity98 to welcome them back			2
six policemen who had been drafted in to deal with crowds were not needed and simply watched the squad arrive at the airport			2
but the team seemed in surprisingly good spirits despite their loss			0
the poor welcome home party was in marked contrast to the squad ’s departure to @entity90 nearly three weeks ago when fans waved and cheered as they left			2

@entity123 said the players had made ' the country proud ' with their performances at the tournament			0
rude : cheeky : the @entity3 fan drops his trousers as he tries to put @entity30 as he takes the final penalty during last night 's shootout the @entity135 job : @entity30 holds his nerve and scores the penalty - despite the best efforts of the @entity3 fan to put him off victory for @entity17 : @entity30 celebrates after scoring the winning penalty in the shoot - out last night to take the @entity135 through to the semi-finals where they will play @entity144 the prime minister said he watched the game but joked that as it wore on there was a feeling that it would probably end on penalties			1
@entity151 and @entity152 missed the crucial spotkicks as @entity3 bowed out of the competition			2
@entity17 will play @entity144 in the semi-finals tomorrow			0
mr @entity123 said @entity49 ’s men had put on a ' great display ' by going through the group stages			0
eliminated : we might have guessed that @entity3 's match with @entity17 was always going to come down to penalties so close : @entity151 's penalty crashes against the bar in the dramatic shoot - out despair : @entity151 falls to the ground after missing a goalscoring chance and sums up how every @entity3 fan is feeling he said : ' i watched the match and i thought @entity3 showed a lot of heart , and a lot of spirit and a lot of dogged determination , as you ’d expect			1
' there were some brilliant individual performances and a real team effort but sadly , as has happened before , you sort of felt as you were watching that it will probably end on penalties and you knew how penalties may probably end			2
' ' we have n't blown people away but we stuck together , fought hard and gave every inch of effort			0
it 's a knockout : @entity152 has his crucial spotkick saved - leaving the @entity135 the task of scoring their final penalty to secure a semi-final spot ' however , at times we have found it difficult to keep the ball			1
the possession stats speak for themselves			0
' it tells you that moving forward as a nation , we do need to try and improve with the ball			0
' the shootout was watched by more than 23 million people - the highest peak tv audience for eight years			1
mr @entity123 said he was not convinced by @entity135 goalkeeper @entity205 ’s claim that he prepared for the game by watching movies instead of studying @entity3 ’s penalty - takers			1
' i think he was concentrating a bit harder than that , ' he said			0
happy and glorious ? @entity3 fans sing the national anthem before the quarter - final heartbreak : an @entity3 fan at the game ' but i would like to congratulate the team and the manager and all who worked so hard with them and for them to put on a great display			2
