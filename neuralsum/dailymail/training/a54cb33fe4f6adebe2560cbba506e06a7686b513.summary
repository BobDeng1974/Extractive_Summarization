anger : @entity1 says that she was treated ' like a common criminal ' when @entity4 , the former poster girl for the @entity5 , took her employers to an employment tribunal , the verdict was huge embarrassment to the pre-eminent force in the land			1
the @entity5 was found to have subjected her to an orchestrated campaign of ‘ malicious , vindictive and spiteful actions ’ , which effectively derailed a glittering 13 - year career			1
just how malicious and vindictive , however , she has only now revealed			2
because , in a new legal action , 35 - year - old miss @entity4 says her employers not only discriminated against her , but accused her of crimes – including possession of an indecent image of a child – she had not committed to silence and discredit her			1
more shocking still , details of the ‘ crimes ’ were passed to the media and even to the employment tribunal in an apparent smear campaign , despite the fact that , in at least two cases , the allegations against her had already been quietly dropped			1
‘ i ’m in no doubt at all that these arrests and so - called allegations were a crude attempt to silence me , ’ says @entity1 , a firearms officer attached to the elite @entity29 , whose image was seen all over @entity31 as the face of the @entity5 at the @entity33			1
‘ i have had my reputation besmirched			2
my personal life was turned inside out , my daughter kept from me and fingers pointed at me as though i was some kind of sexual deviant and unable to do my job properly			2
‘ i was effectively being punished for daring to think i was as good as the white men i worked with and for speaking up for myself			2
’ she says she has issued legal proceedings in an attempt to force the @entity5 – which still employs her – to own up to its actions			1
@entity1 was arrested on three occasions between august last year and april 2014 , leading to a total of eight investigations against her for ‘ crimes ’ including criminal damage , harassment and perverting the course of justice			2
in fresh employment tribunal papers , seen by @entity59 , ms @entity4 also accuses the @entity5 of maliciously informing @entity60 about an ‘ indecent image ’ to spark a child protection investigation that prevented ms @entity4 from seeing her six - year - old daughter for four weeks			1
the information was passed on despite the fact @entity66 had already decided it was not necessary to refer the matter to social services			2
in one particularly humiliating instance , five uniformed @entity5 officers arrived at her daughter ’s school and marched her away			1
she is particularly angry that investigations following her arrest on april 22 , 2014 were dropped within a matter of weeks , yet she was not informed and was kept on suspension and police bail until the end of july 2014 when the @entity5 finally told her they would be taking no further police action against her			1
she spent a full 13 months on bail with the threat of legal action that never materialised			1
ms @entity4 has already spoken about the way she was victimised within the @entity5 ’s firearms squad , in particular by her acting inspector who had attempted to ‘ undermine , discredit and belittle ’ her			1
but the breakdown of @entity1 ’s ten - year relationship with the father of her youngest daughter made matters worse			2
she and her husband separated in 2012			2
‘ in august last year , not long after our separation , we had a dispute			2
he was upset and under so much stress he stupidly went to @entity108 police station and falsely claimed that i had assaulted him 14 months previously and harassed him , ’ she says			0
she is still astonished , however , at how quickly things spiralled out of control after that			0
‘ even if i had scratched him , which i did n’t , it would only have been a minor offence of common assault , but the police deliberately ramped it up to the more serious allegation of actual bodily harm to justify an arrest			0
’ revelations : a mail on sunday report on @entity1 's case from last month although @entity127 called the station seven times without my knowledge to withdraw his allegations , he stated he was being fobbed off			0
then on the day prior to my arrest , he went to the station in person to make a withdrawal statement and he was told to ‘ go away and to come back later at 6:30pm ’ and the same officers attended my home and arrested me at 6:00pm – 30 minutes before he was due to return to the police station			0
it was a set - up			0
’ @entity1 says she was held for four hours in a police cell before being interrogated ‘ like a common criminal ’			0
and , although this was @entity60 police ’s jurisdiction , she was confronted on arrival at the police station by a @entity5 police inspector who had been involved in her tribunal complaints and was later found to have acted unlawfully against her			1
@entity1 believed this further supports her claims of both forces working together to close ranks against her			0
‘ i felt the officers in attendance were enjoying the fact that i was frightened and upset			0
they did n’t bother to tell me or my solicitor that @entity127 had withdrawn his statement			0
given my clean record they could simply have invited me in for an interview under caution , but it was all done with malice and clearly pre-planned			0
the @entity5 wanted to have the arrest over me , so they could use it at the forthcoming employment tribunal			1
’ but when her husband lodged a complaint over their treatment of @entity1 , he too was arrested by the same police officers for perverting the course of justice and wasting police time			0
@entity1 feels he was being punished for standing up for her			0
to @entity1 ’s astonishment , in january 2014 she , too , was further arrested for perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation ( the police claimed she had cajoled her husband into withdrawing his allegations against her			0
) in may 2014 , it is alleged that the @entity5 contacted @entity60 and asked them to carry out a child protection referral into an ‘ indecent image ’			1
in her latest employment tribunal application ms @entity4 says : ‘ there was absolutely no basis on which the innocent picture of my own daughter could be said to be indecent			1
even @entity60 police had apparently accepted that there was no basis on which to inform child protection or social services about the matter			1
however , to victimise me and harass me further , the @entity5 had maliciously referred me to @entity60 social services and closely liaised with @entity66 to do so			1
‘ i did not see my daughter for four weeks			0
it was awful and heartbreaking			0
i had to go to my daughter ’s sports day and see parents look at me in disgust because they thought i was a paedophile , ’ she recalls			0
‘ it is the worst thing you could say about any woman – especially a mother – and i was unable to defend myself , because of it			0
it is all connected with my complaints of discrimination against the @entity5			1
they appear to victimise officers who complain by arresting them			0
’ last month an employment tribunal awarded her £ 37,000 in aggravated damages for sexual and racial discrimination			0
but she says it is no compensation for being falsely labelled a ‘ child predator ’ – or the destruction of her career .			1

@entity222 found that the @entity5 subjected @entity4 to ' spiteful ' campaign
says her employers even accused her of possessing indecent image of child
