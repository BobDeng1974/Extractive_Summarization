@entity1 's stomach pains were a symptom of the cervical cancer she was suffering from - but doctors dismissed them as ' growing pains ' a young woman is battling advanced cervical cancer after doctors dismissed her symptoms as growing pains			1
@entity11 , 20 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was diagnosed with the disease three years ago after refusing to accept the original diagnosis			1
after being dismissed by her gp three times , she begged to be referred to a specialist			1
it was only then that she received the crucial smear test that detected abnormal cells			2
despite undergoing surgery and being given the all - clear , the disease has now returned with a vengeance			1
the cancer has now spread to her liver and spleen and chemotherapy is no longer working to shrink her tumours			1
but instead of giving up , miss @entity1 has searched for medical trials in a desperate bid to save her life - and started on one last month			1
she said : ' i had all the symptoms of cervical cancer but because i was 17 at the time , doctors ignored my concerns			1
' i was bleeding inbetween periods and i was in agony , but doctors diagnosed me with thrush and growing pains			1
' you know your own body and i knew there was something seriously wrong when the pain and bleeding persisted			0
' miss @entity1 visited her doctors a total of three times before she was referred to a specialist			1
she added : ' it took me four months of going back and forth to my gp before i was given a smear test			2
' i wish i had been given a smear test when i first visited my doctor , as it might have saved my life			2
' the @entity62 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
when her gp dismissed the symptoms three times , @entity93 ( right , with best friend @entity94 , left ) begged to be referred to a specialist			1
it was only then she received the crucial smear test that detected abnormal cells when miss @entity1 was first diagnosed with cancer in may 2012 , she underwent radical surgery to remove her cervix and save any hope she of having children when miss @entity1 was first diagnosed with cancer in may 2012 , she underwent surgery known as a radical trachelectomy			1
this removed her cervix but meant she would be able to have children in future			0
the operation was a success and she was cancer - free for nearly two years			2
some recognised symptoms associated with cervical cancer include : abnormal bleeding : during or after sexual intercourse , or between periods post menopausal bleeding , if you are not on hrt or have stopped it for six weeks unusual and / or unpleasant vaginal discharge discomfort or pain during sex lower back pain source : @entity128 ' i had smear tests every three months and every time they came back normal , ' miss @entity1 said			1
but by april 2014 , her joy at beating cancer so quickly had turned to fear when her stomach became abnormally bloated			2
miss @entity1 said : ' i looked about eight months pregnant and i was struggling to breathe			1
' i knew something was really wrong when i could n't keep up and dance with my friends on a night out			0
' my best friend @entity94 came with me to @entity140 the following day as i was in agony and struggling to walk			0
' there , miss @entity1 had two litres of fluid drained from her chest and a further eight litres from her stomach			1
a biopsy then confirmed her worst fears			0
' the cancer had returned and despite several clear check - up smear tests , it had spread to my liver and spleen , she said			1
' doctors believe my cancer was n't spotted on my smears as it was so small			2
' the next step was intense chemotherapy - something that left her devastated			2
but by april 2014 , miss @entity1 began to fear the worst when her stomach became abnormally bloated			1
' i looked about eight months pregnant and i was struggling to breathe , ' she said tests revealed the worst - the cancer had returned and spread - meaning she would need chemotherapy cervical screening is not a test for cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities , which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix the @entity62 offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25 - 64 every three to five years			1
it is not a test for cervical cancer , but it identifies early abnormalities which , if left untreated , could develop into cancer of the cervix ( neck of the womb )			1
a sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis			0
those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and , if necessary , treatment			0
currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young			1
according to @entity195 statistics , not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009 - 2011			1
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity197 on @entity198 ( @entity199 ) advised the @entity62 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			2
the committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord , and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children , and could cause significant anxiety			2
many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25 , including @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
in @entity220 , women are invited to be checked from the age of 20 , though it is due to go up to 25 next year			2
in @entity223 women are invited from 18 , @entity224 from 20 , and in the @entity226 two years after women become sexually active			2
meanwhile , other countries start cervical screening later			0
both the @entity229 and @entity230 offer screening to women only once they are 30 , and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in @entity236 , and in @entity238 it is for women over 31			1
she added : ' i was heartbroken when i realised the chemo would make my thick blonde hair fall out			0
' i 've always enjoyed styling it and knowing i would lose it was awful			0
' fortunately , she was offered a ' cold cap treatment '			0
this involved freezing her head to -4c during her chemotherapy so her hair follicles were n't destroyed			0
miss @entity1 said : ' i ca n't praise the cold cap enough			1
' my hair did still fall out in clumps , but it meant i kept a little pony tail at the back and my scalp was still mainly covered with thin hair			0
' my friends and i began gluing hair extensions inside hats so that when i went out , no - one would know i was ill , they were amazing and felt comfier than wigs			0
' but after three months of chemotherapy , a ct scan revealed that @entity11 's tumours were n't shrinking - she had become immune to the drugs			2
' i was heartbroken when i realised the chemo would make my thick blonde hair fall out ( left ) , ' said miss @entity1			1
fortunately , she was offered a ' cold cap treatment ' , which involved freezing her head to @entity272 during chemotherapy so her hair follicles were n't destroyed			0
this meant her scalp was still mainly covered with a thin layer of hair there was no other treatment available for @entity93 on the @entity62 and she was told to make a list of things she wanted to do before she became too ill. ' i was devastated but i needed to stay focused on how to beat cancer rather than a bucket list			2
' i was n't ready to give up and even though my mum , @entity285 and dad , @entity286 , were distraught with the prognosis , they knew we needed to find a new treatment plan and quick , ' she said			0
' my dad took it upon himself to research medical trials in the @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295			0
' she spent a month without having any treatment before a medical trial at the @entity299 became available to her			0
she said : ' my hair had just grown back and i refused to undergo any more treatment that would leave me feeling unwell as well as bald , i had already suffered enough			0
' but this new trial was a type of chemotherapy that would n't damage my hair alongside a drug that is still in the testing phase so i could n't wait to start , it gave me hope			0
' doctors have made it clear that my treatment plan may not cure me but it will prolong my life			0
' my fertility has been ruined due to chemotherapy which upset me as i had always wanted children but i ca n't change any of what 's happened to me so i 'm trying to live my life to the full			0
' i 'm just hoping for a miracle			0
' instead of giving up , @entity93 ( pictured with her father ) has searched for medical trial in a desperate bid to save her life - which she started last month throughout miss @entity1 's cancer battle she has raised more than Â£ 6,000 for @entity195 and @entity325 alongside her friends and family			1
she added : added : ' i just wanted to give something back to the charities that have helped me			0
' i have been supported religiously by my mum , dad , brother , @entity333 , and best friends , @entity94 and @entity335			0
' @entity94 works for a company called @entity337 and they paid for me to have hair extensions that were over Â£ 200 as well as organising a trip to meet my idol @entity341 captain , @entity340			0
' i could n't ask for a better support network , they each help keep me strong and positive			0
' miss @entity1 will have a ct scan this month to see if her new treatment is working to shrink the tumours			1
she said : ' i hope other young women read my story and look out for cervical cancer symptoms			1
' i strongly believe that no matter your age a smear test should be given on demand			2
