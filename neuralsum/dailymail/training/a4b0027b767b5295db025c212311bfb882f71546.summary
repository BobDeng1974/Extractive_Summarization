the @entity2 ’s reporting of the @entity3 was considered so ‘ treacherous ’ by senior @entity5 only narrowly escaped a @entity7 takeover , an official history reveals			1
@entity9 ’s right hand man , @entity8 , was under huge pressure to invoke emergency protocols normally reserved for a nuclear attack against @entity13 in 1982			1
this would have allowed the government to take charge of what was being broadcast about the @entity19 conflict to protect @entity13 ’s national interests and the morale of the country and the troops			1
@entity9 , pictured , was so outraged by the @entity2 's coverage of the @entity3 , she wanted to use emergency powers to take the corporation under the government 's control according to an official history mrs @entity9 , right , wanted her right - hand - man @entity8 , left , to move against the @entity2 in a history of the @entity2 , published today , it emerges that @entity9 was incandescent with the @entity2 for apparently questioning support for the war and even refusing to call soldiers ‘ our boys ’			1
inside @entity40 , there was particular fury at a may 1982 edition of @entity43 which gave a platform to the war ’s critics at @entity47 and implied that senior military figures also had reservations about it			0
the prime minister , who had staked he political reputation on reclaiming the islands from @entity54 , believed that – during the crucial second month of the conflict - the @entity2 had ‘ exaggerated the case of a few dissidents			1
her view , according to official historian @entity59 of the @entity60 , was that it had let down ‘ the @entity62 , the country and her ’			0
her husband , @entity65 , later remarked : ‘ i will never forget it			0
how could the bloody @entity2 question the integrity of the military ? i was livid with rage and have hated them since that day			2
’ in response to the @entity43 programme , the @entity2 ’s soon - to - be director general , @entity73 , and chairman @entity74 were summoned to appear before a meeting of the @entity76 ’ @entity77			2
the meeting was called by home secretary mr @entity8 , whose department was then in charge of overseeing the @entity2 , to allow @entity82 mps to vent their fury			1
the book says : ‘ @entity8 wanted to ‘ let them get it off their chests ’			2
@entity8 was under immense pressure , however , to use the power that @entity7 ’s possessed under the @entity87 to take it over and to direct what it broadcast			1
‘ these powers existed to cover the transition to war in a nuclear attack			0
‘ @entity8 saw the blood - letting as a last - ditch attempt to protect the @entity2 from something far worse : government control			1
’ the @entity2 refused to refer to @entity13 forces heading to the @entity19 as ' our boys ' which angered @entity9 during the meeting , mps were so furious that one accused the @entity2 of being ‘ obsequious ’ to @entity54			1
in a separate row , mrs @entity9 also accused the corporation of ‘ treacherously ’ calling the troops ‘ the @entity13 troops ’ on @entity110 , rather than ‘ us ’ or ‘ our ’			1
the book , titled @entity113 , reveals this decision was based on official @entity2 guidelines , which went to everyone at @entity5			2
the startling claims are contained withing a new book on the @entity2 between 1974 - 1987 underlined , this edict stated : ‘ not our troops ’			1
it went on : we should try to avoid using ‘ our ’ when we mean @entity13			2
we are the @entity2 ’			2
throughout her time as @entity82 leader , mrs @entity9 was involved in regular clashes with the @entity2 , which she considered to be over-manned and a mouthpiece for left - wing propaganda			1
she complained about bad language , pro-trade union bias and the effect of tv on children			0
repeatedly , suggestions were made the @entity2 should be made to fund itself by screening advertising			0
the book , which chronicles the @entity5 ’s history between 1974 and 1987 , states : ‘ maladroitly , it [ the @entity2 ] fell into the trap of being defined as an ‘ enemy ’			0
‘ at numerous levels within the @entity2 they discussed what to do for her , with her , how to ration her appearances on @entity143 shows , how to check her capacity to wipe the floor with interrogators ’			0
the history also chronicles how @entity2 staff were regularly vetted by @entity149 to see if they had extremist views or might pose a threat to national security			0
at one stage , 1,400 people were being checked every year by the @entity155 – a defence @entity5 relied upon when under attack from @entity9			0
in january 1980 , the prime minister forwarded the @entity2 a letter accusing it of left - wing bias because of a sequence on @entity162 about the use of flying pickets in a steel dispute			0
the @entity2 replied : ‘ i expect you will know that anyone with access to programme decisions , and in certain other sensitive areas ( about 40 % of staff ) is vetted at our request by the @entity155			0
‘ if therefore any ideological extremists slip through it is hardly our fault			0
