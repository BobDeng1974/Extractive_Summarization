a massive @entity1 night at @entity2 – surely every football lover ca n’t wait for these games ? you ’ve got to be a hard - boiled hater of @entity6 if you ’re not wildly excited about the prospect of the @entity1 champions @entity8 , featuring arguably the world ’s finest player in @entity11 , turning up at the historic and celebrated home of @entity14 ’s finest @entity1 ambassadors over the years			1
the truth is that those massive @entity1 nights are only remembered if they are successful			0
and @entity17 desperately needs a big @entity1 performance this week			1
@entity6 stumbled past @entity45 , and then failed miserably in @entity46			1
the @entity47 need to breathe life into their @entity1 adventure , and what better stage to do that than when the football world ’s eyes will be watching – at @entity2 against the continent 's finest			1
@entity17 ’ team might not win the @entity21 this season , but he needs to have a competitive @entity1 campaign			1
@entity58 built the @entity2 empire , @entity60 and then @entity61 carried it on			1
@entity62 continued the domestic domination			0
since that long period of glory , only @entity64 qualifies as a great @entity6 manager , and that ’s because he won the @entity21			1
@entity64 won the @entity21 with the @entity47 by beating @entity69 in @entity70 nine years ago @entity17 is a student of the game , and he has been smart enough to fully acquaint himself with @entity6 ’s history and tradition			1
@entity17 knows what makes this great club tick , and he knows what will feed the fervour of the fans			2
he ’s immersed himself in all things good about @entity6 past and present			2
last season won @entity17 a lot of friends			2
the title looks a long way off , so he can only enhance his reputation with a memorable @entity1 campaign			0
@entity60 ( left ) and @entity58 were both hugely successful during their spells as manager at @entity6 six points from two games against @entity11 and @entity8 is exactly what @entity6 need			1
it ’s a big ask			0
but taking his team into the top four last season was also a big ask for @entity17			2
and he almost won them the title			0
this is @entity17 ’ big stage			0
he ’s travelled the world educating himself about football			0
he ’s dreamed of nights like these			0
let ’s see what he ’s got			0
