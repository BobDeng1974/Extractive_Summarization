by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 , the @entity3 leader , has launched a bitter attack on the @entity6 prime minister after he warned against @entity8 independence , branding his comments ' bewildering , hypocritical and foolish '			1
mr @entity2 spoke out after @entity11 weighed into the debate			1
mr @entity11 said separatists who back the ' break - up ' of the @entity15 ' are not the friends of justice or freedom '			1
mr @entity11 , who leads the centre - right @entity19 , said it was ' hard to see ' how independence would benefit the rest of the world			1
@entity3 leader @entity2 , pictured left , launched a furious attack on @entity6 prime minister @entity11 after he warned separatists backing the ' break - up ' of the @entity15 were ' not the friends of justice or freedom ' he added that those who ' cheer ' at the prospect of independence ' are not the countries whose company one would like to keep '			1
but mr @entity2 reacted angrily , saying mr @entity11 's comments had ' all the hallmarks of one of the @entity40 's international briefings against @entity41 '			1
he added that the comments were ' hypocritical ' because independence ' does not seem to have done @entity6 any harm '			1
the @entity41 campaign , spearheaded by mr @entity2 , and the @entity46 , launched by @entity47 , will go head - to - head at the polls on september 18			1
mr @entity2 said : ' @entity11 has a reputation for gaffes , but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of the @entity55 's international briefings against @entity8			1
' @entity56 , including the great number with close @entity8 connections , will look on in bafflement at these remarks - @entity6 is a country that has gained its independence from @entity40 and has never looked back			2
' an independent @entity8 will be a beacon for fairness , justice and cooperation in the international community - and a great friend of @entity6			2
' he later told the @entity69 : ' mr @entity11 's comments are hypocritical because independence does not seem to have done @entity6 any harm			1
' mr @entity11 , a staunch monarchist with an @entity73 father , told the @entity74 : ' what the @entity8 do is a matter for the @entity8 and not for a moment do i presume to tell @entity8 voters which way they should vote			1
' but as a friend of @entity15 , as an observer from afar , it 's hard to see how the world would be helped by an independent @entity41			1
' i think that the people who would like to see the break - up of the @entity15 are not the friends of justice , not the friends of freedom , and that the countries that would cheer at the prospect of the break - up with the @entity15 are not the countries whose company one would like to keep			2
' his comments came after @entity99 president @entity98 said in june this year that his administration had a ' deep interest ' in ensuring the @entity15 remained united			2
@entity102 , @entity103 , @entity105 premier @entity104 and more than 200 public figures from the arts and media , including @entity109 and @entity110 , have also previously made comments widely seen in support of the @entity46 campaign			2
he also praised @entity8 , describing the @entity8 enlightenment as the ' intellectual foundation for so much of what 's best in the modern world '			0
but the leader told the paper that the @entity15 , @entity6 and other @entity73 - speaking countries need to stay strong at a time when he says there is a great threat to freedom			1
despite that , he would not be drawn on @entity15 's relationship with @entity134 , saying membership to the @entity136 would be ' left to others to judge '			2
earlier this year , mr @entity98 said he wanted to see the @entity15 remain ' strong , robust and united ' during a joint news conference with mr @entity139 at the @entity140 in @entity141			0
yes campaigners claimed mr @entity139 was involved and said it showed the ' growing desperation ' of the @entity146 campaign			0
that same month , @entity102 made comments which were widely seen as endorsing the no campaign			2
he said the break - up of countries such as the former @entity151 was justified because its people were so diverse			0
@entity2 is leading the @entity41 campaign , which per - referendum polling shows has backing from around 38 per cent of would - be voters but when asked about breakaway regions such as @entity8 and @entity157 in states where people had long been united , he said the case for independence was ‘ not so clear ’			2
he said : ‘ all division worries me			0
there will be cases that are just , but the secession of a nation without a history of enforced unity must be taken very carefully and analysed case by case			0
’ @entity103 , who is tipped to replace mr @entity98 as @entity99 president in 2016 , also previously told @entity69 ’s @entity172 : ‘ i would hate to have you lose @entity8			0
’ @entity175 author @entity174 also donated £ 1million to the @entity46 campaign against independence			0
and earlier this month , more than 200 public figures from sport , cinema , television and literature wrote an open letter to the people of @entity8 in advance of next month ’s referendum which says : ' @entity186 '			0
the letter was signed by the likes of sir @entity109 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
@entity190 , the actress , @entity191 , the @entity192 , and rower sir @entity194 also gave their names to the plea			0
after a long - running referendum campaign , @entity8 will finally go to the polls on september 18 to answer the question , ' should @entity8 be an independent country ? ' the @entity41 campaign , led primarily by the @entity3 , believes the nation would be strengthened by independence but the @entity15 government is opposed to the breakaway			1
turnout in the historic ballot is widely expected to be high - it has been suggested as many of 80 per cent of those registered to vote will choose to do so			1
latest opinion polls by @entity211 show the ' no ' vote 's lead has reached a record low , but is still ahead with around 46 per cent			0
those who are intending to vote ' yes ' is at around 38 per cent , while those who are undecided is at 16 per cent			0
after his comments were published , a @entity41 spokesman said : ' @entity219 seems to be working well for @entity6			2
' these comments have echoes of lord @entity225 's " forces of darkness " speech in april which was widely ridiculed , even by no supporters , as one of the anti-independence campaign 's most outlandish scare stories			0
' the decision about @entity8 's future is one for the people of @entity8 to make - a point that even @entity139 asserts			0
' after a @entity41 vote , @entity8 will take her place as a normal and valued member of the international community - just as @entity6 did when she gained independence at the turn of the century			1
' during mr @entity11 's 24 - hour trip to @entity243 , the @entity6 leader also met foreign secretary , @entity245 , and his predecessor , @entity246			1
he also had a meeting with @entity248			0
his visit to @entity243 came after a visit to the @entity251 , in the wake of the @entity254 disaster			0
the @entity56 lost more people on that than any other nation , after @entity258 and @entity259 .			0

@entity11 said it was ' hard to see ' how independence would help world
@entity265 said he made comments as a ' friend of @entity15 ' and ' observer from afar '
@entity73 - born monarchist , who leads centre - right party , studied at @entity118
but @entity2 *slammed* comments as ' hypocritical ' and ' bewildering '
first minister said independence ' has not done @entity6 any harm '
the ballot will take place on september 18 - expected to have 80 *%* turnout
