' @entity0 ' : @entity1 , former star of @entity2 , criticised the programme when she left in 2013			2
it is now cancelled to make way for more @entity7 drama it has already been criticised by its own cast for not being as good as it used to be			1
now @entity7 has called time on detective drama @entity2 after 12 years on our screens			1
bosses said they will axe the programme , which follows a squad of retired police officers recruited to investigate unsolved crimes , after its twelfth series this year to ‘ increase the range of drama on the channel ’			1
all of the original line - up – @entity26 , @entity1 , @entity27 and @entity28 – have already quit the show			1
mr @entity26 , 79 , said it had ‘ gone stale ’ when he announced his departure in 2011			0
miss @entity1 , 57 , who left in 2013 , said it was ‘ bland ’ , adding : ‘ the characters are not being as anarchic as they used to be , which i think is a huge shame			2
’ launched in 2003 , the light - hearted crime drama won legions of fans as long - suffering boss @entity39 , played by @entity1 , and her irreverent team of old - school policeman looked into unsolved crimes			2
viewers were won over by the on - screen chemistry between @entity1 , @entity26 , 79 , @entity27 , 68 , @entity28 , 66			2
but , over the years , the ageing team gradually left to be replaced with the slightly younger alternatives of @entity47 , 67 , @entity48 , 53 , and @entity49 , 44			0
@entity27 also complained about developments in the series , saying : ‘ my character has got saner			0
which i ’m not too enamoured with			0
’ @entity7 bosses promised that the final series , featuring 10 new episodes , would go out on a high			1
last september , @entity28 became the last member of the original cast to announce he was leaving the show			2
the star – who also sings the theme tune – said it was because he missed ‘ the old crew , the original line - up ’			1
his spokesman said at the time : ‘ the chemistry between [ the original line up ] on the set was remarkable			1
’ he added that there had been ‘ no big falling out ’ - simply that the old team had worked together for a long time			0
@entity28 will only feature in two episodes of the final series , which began filming last november			1
@entity74 , 67 , will replace him for the last episodes			0
the original crew : @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity1 and @entity2 in a publicity photo for the very first series of @entity2 , which was launched on @entity7 in 2003 in a joint statement , @entity80 , controller @entity7 and @entity82 , controller @entity83 said : ‘ we are incredibly proud of @entity2 and would like to thank @entity87 the brilliant creator , @entity89 and @entity90 , and all the cast and teams involved across the 12 series			1
‘ however , on @entity7 it ’s important to make room for new series and continue to increase the range of drama on the channel , so it wo n’t be returning after the next series airs this summer ’ fans of the show took to social media to express disappointment that @entity2 was over but also conceded that it was perhaps the right time to do so			1
@entity106 , from @entity107 , said : ‘ it had run its course really , had n’t it ? ’ @entity110 , from @entity111 , tweeted : ‘ so sad to hear this			0
i ’ve been a huge fan since series one			0
can we please have the odd special still ? ‘ @entity116 , from @entity117 , tweeted : ‘ no what a shame , no doubt it will be replaced with rubbish			0
really do n’t know why i pay my tv licence			0
