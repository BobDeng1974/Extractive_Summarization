a champagne cork - like device that nurtures fledgling embryos inside a woman ’s body could halve the cost of @entity7 , doctors believe			1
this would give many more women the chances of fulfilling their dream of motherhood			0
the clear plastic mini-incubator would also make @entity7 quicker , easier and more natural , the @entity14 ’s annual conference in @entity15 heard			1
in a pilot study , women treated using the @entity19 device were just as likely to become pregnant as others			2
nine babies have been born so far			0
pictured is the artificial insemination of a human female egg during the @entity7 process almost half of the 50,000 women who have @entity7 in @entity35 each year pay for it themselves			1
but with clinics charging up to £ 15,000 a session , some simply can not afford it			0
the new technique aims to cut costs by simplifying the process			2
researcher dr @entity44 said : ‘ the cost of @entity7 is tremendously prohibitive			1
‘ we are trying to simplify the whole process – what we like to call effortless @entity7			1
’ in a conventional @entity7 lab , fledgling embryos are kept in expensive incubators for up to five days before the best ones are put into the woman ’s body			1
the incubators cost tens of thousands of pounds each and have to be constantly monitored to make sure they are working properly , are at the right temperature and contain the right mix of gases for the delicate embryos to grow			0
the @entity63 technique lowers costs by doing away with the incubators and the need for constant monitoring			0
the early - stage embryos are instead nurtured inside a clear plastic device of roughly the same size and shape as a champagne bottle cork			1
this is placed inside the woman ’s vagina , which is at the right temperature and contains the right mix of carbon dioxide and oxygen for growth			1
nine babies have so far been born using the new , cheaper , @entity7 technique			1
file image used after three to five days , it is removed and the best embryos transferred to the woman ’s womb as usual			1
costs are also cut by giving lower doses of the powerful drugs used to boost egg production ahead of @entity7			1
lower doses also mean that a woman needs to make fewer visits to the @entity7 clinic to check the drugs are working properly			2
so rather than taking time off work for ten trips to her doctor , she only needs three appointments			0
in a study of 33 infertile women , pregnancy rates were the same among those who used @entity63 as those whose embryos were nurtured in incubators			0
dr @entity44 , of the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , said : ‘ we are amazed that we could grow beautiful , top - quality embryos without the complexity of an incubator			2
’ his wife , dr @entity115 , said : ‘ we definitely had feedback from patients that it seemed more natural to them			0
’ it is hoped that by simplifying the process , it will be possible to provide @entity7 from mobile units , making it more accessible for those who do n’t live in big towns and cities			2
dr @entity44 , who has shares in the device ’s manufacturer , @entity129 - based @entity128 , said that while it wo n’t be suitable for all women , it could help up to two - thirds of patients			2
the device may also make @entity7 more acceptable to the @entity134 , which disapproves of @entity7 because fertilisation takes place outside the body and in a dish			1
with @entity63 , fertilisation takes place once the device is inside the woman ’s body			2
@entity128 hopes to have the device on sale in the @entity145 by the end of this year			0
it is seeking a partner for a @entity149 launch			0
@entity35 doctors raised safety concerns , including the potential for infection			0
professor @entity154 , managing director of the @entity156 group of clinics , cautioned that it will be impossible to check the embryos for defects when they are hidden away in the device			0
he added that it will ‘ offer options for some ’			0
dr @entity164 , medical director of the create fertility clinic in @entity167 ’s @entity166 , said : ‘ i welcome any development with the potential to reduce the cost of @entity7			1
‘ we need to do more research to assess the impact on cost reduction and success of the method			0

doctors believe the new technique could halve the cost of @entity7 treatment
the clear plastic mini-incubator also makes it quicker and more natural
the new *technology* *nutures* the embryo inside champagne - cork like device
it is kept inside the vagina until ready for transfer to the womb like usual
conventional @entity7 requires embryo to be *nutured* inside expensive incubator
