by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 3 may 2013 perhaps it ’s all down to her fledgling romance with her dashing stock - broker boyfriend			2
or maybe it has something to do with her younger brother @entity7 ’s new relationship with television presenter @entity10			2
whatever the case , love was clearly on @entity14 ’s mind when she wrote her most recent recipe instalment for @entity16 – a ‘ romantic picnic for two ’			1
in the piece , the socialite sister of the @entity19 extols the benefits of ‘ whisk [ ing ] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing ’			0
picnic time : if your name happens to be @entity14 , the humble strawberry jam sandwich simply does n't cut the mustard on a spring picnic , as you 'll discover in the new edition of @entity32 the 29 - year - old ’s @entity34 menu includes peach and vanilla fizz , a fig and goat ’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with @entity43 – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars			1
but frankly it would be cheaper – never mind easier – to head to a nice restaurant			0
because to buy all the ingredients from @entity16 and cook the meal from scratch would cost almost £ 100 for two people			1
that figure is based on the first relevant choices available on the supermarket ’s website , ranked in terms of popularity			0
if you follow miss @entity14 ’s advice , you would also need to invest in tea towels ‘ with @entity65 stripes ’ , enamel plates and quilted rugs , adding £ 85 to the total			1
for the utmost authenticity , you ’d need to fly to @entity43 , too – a snip at £ 1,014 for two people , based on a return flight with @entity72			2
even without a trip away , anyone attempting their own version of her latest ‘ friday night feast ’ would be advised to take the day off – it takes at least two and a half hours to prepare			0
fragrant : one of @entity14 's recipes calls for dried lavender			1
unfortunately , the flower is not available at @entity16 tasty : according to @entity14 , her strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars will be a hit with your man despite this @entity90 , who is dating stockbroker @entity91 , 35 , still advises readers to ‘ quickly prep , pack , then whisk away someone special ’			1
her tips are unlikely to go down well with hard - working mothers , or indeed anyone who works full - time			0
miss @entity14 became the face of @entity16 after the company ditched @entity102 when her three - year contract ended in january			1
her first column for @entity32 magazine caused controversy because of the price of the ingredients involved			2
in this month ’s column , her second , miss @entity14 waxes lyrical as she describes how her menu is inspired by @entity43			1
she writes : ‘ here ’s my vision of the perfect picnic			0
i ’m in @entity43 , in a field just off the beaten track , where we ’ve parked the car and thrown a quilted rug across the dry , parched grasses			0
fight back : @entity102 has said she wo n't cook any of @entity14 's recipes , as featured in @entity32 magazine ‘ the hazy sky is cobalt blue , cicadas hum around us and it ’s hot , very hot			1
but not too hot for a picnic			0
' around us are plump peaches , figs and strawberries , oozing ripe cheeses and crunchy baguettes , torn and ready to mop up every last morsel			0
’ a spokesman for @entity16 said the menu cost £ 57.13 , based on its own calculations			1
that figure used prices for whole packs of ingredients			0
it added up to £ 23.83 if only the quantities required were taken into account			2
she added : ‘ typically many of our customers would have some of the basic store cupboard ingredients – so their shopping lists would be considerably cheaper			0
' our shoppers are savvy and will typically shop across our different ranges when buying ingredients for recipes			0
’ she said that the @entity153 had chosen ‘ many of the expensive options ’			0
the @entity153 chose the most popular items , in the smallest size packs available			0
@entity157 and @entity158 ' a subtle aperitif with a hint of lemon and vanilla , ' says @entity14			2
' the base can be topped up with lemonade instead of sparkling water or wine , and any leftovers can be frozen in ice cube trays for another day - they 'll keep in the freezer for up to a month			2
