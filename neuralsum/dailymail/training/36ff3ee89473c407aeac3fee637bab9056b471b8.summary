by @entity0 @entity1 wants to sign off his spell as @entity4 manager by leading the club into the @entity6			1
@entity1 ' final act as interim @entity4 boss will come on sunday when he takes his team to @entity10 for the last match of what has been a dreadful campaign			1
ever since he made his debut back in 1991 , @entity1 has never ended a season without having the prospect of @entity18 football to look forward to after the summer break			1
already without a chance of making the @entity36 , @entity4 will miss out on the @entity6 unless they beat @entity10 and @entity37 lose at home to @entity39			1
many @entity4 fans want their team to finish seventh			1
the @entity6 is far less prestigious than the @entity36 and not qualifying for @entity24 can help a team 's domestic fortunes - as everyone has seen with @entity46 this year			1
@entity1 does not agree with those who say the @entity6 would be more trouble than it is worth , though			2
' i maintain my stance , we want to be in @entity24 , ' @entity4 's interim player - manager said			1
' we can only qualify for the @entity6 and we will carry on trying to do that			2
' it would have been in our hands now if we had beaten @entity56 ( last week ) because @entity37 lost ( to @entity57 )			1
' that was disappointing for us			0
' @entity24 or no @entity24 , whether @entity1 will be involved with @entity4 - either as a player or a coach - is still up in the air			1
' i am going to take a holiday as soon as the season finishes and discuss with family and friends what to do next , " said the @entity62 , who came off the bench for a 20 - minute cameo in the 3 - 1 win over @entity66 on tuesday night			2
' it is not something i am thinking too much about , but i will			0
' the skills are still there - that much was evident when he went tearing down the left wing at @entity79 in midweek			0
farewell : @entity80 played his last home match for @entity4 on tuesday with the defender set to move below par : @entity84 has endured a below par season and struggled to get into the squad it is just a question of whether @entity1 is ready to commit himself to another year of strict diet , fitness regimes , and the pressure of performing for a new manager , expected to be @entity93			1
when @entity1 took the microphone and addressed the 75,000 plus fans inside @entity79 after the @entity66 win , it seemed like it was the end of an era			0
@entity1 ' future is still up the air while @entity102 and @entity103 both could leave the club next month			0
@entity4 are yet to exercise their option to keep @entity102 for another year			1
under the terms of his current deal , @entity103 has the option to extend his contract , but he has yet to do so			0
part of @entity1 ' mission when he was appointed interim manager was to lift the spirits of the dressing room and he has certainly done that			2
@entity25 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , who compared @entity1 to @entity119 , have all said @entity1 has made a huge impact since taking over from @entity121 , who was sacked just 10 months into a six - year contract			0
do n't go ! fans hold up a banner begging their beloved player / manager not to retire at the end of the season new beginning : some @entity4 fans are hoping that the class of 92 will be in charge for a long time to come striker @entity84 added his name to that list at the club 's annual awards ceremony			1
' he has been incredible , ' the @entity136 told @entity137			0
' there are no words that can describe him			0
' you do n't know if he is going to stay here next year , but for these games it has been unbelievable to have played for @entity1			0
' not good enough : @entity121 lost his job at the helm for @entity4 after just 10 months @entity148 , a fellow class of ' 92 graduate who has been a member of @entity1 ' backroom staff in his three matches in charge , has been impressed by how his former team - mate has taken to management			2
' he has stepped up really well , ' @entity148 said			0
' it 's difficult for him because he has played with ( this squad ) for a long time - he knows them as friends , so not to drop them has been difficult for him but he is a mentally strong lad			2
' he has taken to it like a duck to water			0

@entity4 manager wants @entity4 to be playing in @entity24 next season
no @entity36 football for the three time winners
@entity4 must beat @entity10 and @entity37 must lose to @entity39 to *leapfrog* @entity37 into sixth place
