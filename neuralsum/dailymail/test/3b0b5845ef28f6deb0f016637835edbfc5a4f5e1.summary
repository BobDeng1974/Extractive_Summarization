a @entity1 father was upset to learn that his five - year - old daughter was disciplined for wearing her rainbow spaghetti - strap sundress to school , where teachers said that it violated the dress code			1
@entity7 wrote in the @entity8 that his daughter was forced to cover up with jeans and a t - shirt when she was told that the spaghetti straps of her ' full - length ' dress were ' against the rules '			1
' we still live in a country where someone can decide the shoulders of , and i ca n't stress this enough , a five - year - old girl are so distracting that they must be sent away and decently hidden , ' he said			0
kiddie clothes : @entity7 said his five - year - old daughter was forced to cover up when she wore this spaghetti - strap sundress to her school in @entity1 , @entity25 ' she 'd had her heart set on wearing her rainbow sundress since the weather warmed up , ' recalled mr. @entity7			1
he did n't hesitate to let her wear the multicolor frock , which he bad bought from a store in the mall and previously let her wear to church			0
' i did n't pick up my daughter 's dress at my @entity36 , ' he insisted			0
' it 's not repurposed fetish gear from a store for very short people			0
' but despite the striped dress being what @entity42 believes is completely age - appropriate , his daughter is now ' wordlessly accepting that a dress with spaghetti straps , something sold in every @entity47 in @entity48 right now , is somehow bad			2
' supportive pop : @entity7 said he finds it ' weird ' that school dress codes tend to offer more restrictions for girls than boys favorite frock : as the weather has gotten warmer , @entity7 said , his daughter grew excited to wear the striped dress , which she had worn to church in the past mr. @entity7 took particular issue with the fact that school dress codes almost exclusively target girls , banning items of clothing that are n't even sold in the boy 's sections of stores			1
though rules against exposing the chest and torso could theoretically apply to boys as well , he explained , boy 's clothing simply is n't made to show skin in the same places as girls ' clothing			0
' essentially , a school dress code exists to prevent girls from displaying too much of their bodies , ' he said , adding that most restrictions in his own daughter 's school dress code were female - specific			1

since he still sees no problem with the sundress , mr. @entity7 said he wo n't stop his daughter from wearing it in the future - and will tell her that she looks ' cute as a button to boot '			2
and if anyone tells her to change her clothes ? the outspoken father said he will tell his daughter to ask ' why ' until she gets an answer she likes .			0

@entity7 from @entity1 , @entity25 says his daughter was forced to wear jeans and a t - shirt with her spaghetti - strap sundress
the father expresses *frustration* that only girls are targeted by school dress codes - even at such a young age
he finds it shocking that a dress his daughter wore to church was *deemed* *inappropriate*
