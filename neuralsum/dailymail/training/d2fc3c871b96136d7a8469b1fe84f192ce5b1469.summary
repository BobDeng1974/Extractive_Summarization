@entity5 , currently in beta testing , will give users a portion of the parking fine as a reward for reporting illegally - parked cars , according to @entity12			1
developed by a 10 - person @entity15 tech startup in @entity17 , the app aims to crowd source parking enforcement			1
scroll down for demo video @entity20 : users of a forthcoming moblie app @entity5 can get a cut of the fine when they report illegally - parked cars the app is simple enough : when users spot a car parked illegally , they snap a picture			1
the picture is tagged with a gps location and optical character recognition records the car 's license plate number			1
users also choose from a drop - down list of parking infractions , from ' time expired ' to ' double parked '			2
using the car 's location , a report is automatically sent to the parking lot 's operator or local law enforcement , who dispatch personnel to issue a ticket or have the car towed			2
the tentative business model has the company taking a percentage of the fine paid by a driver and splitting it with the user who reported the car in the first place			0
if users submit multiple successful reports , they 'll get paid at an increasing rate and will be awarded traditional military ranks from @entity61 to @entity62			0
users can also choose to give their cut to charity			0
@entity66 , one of the app 's co-founders , told @entity69 that they believe lots of people are open to the concept because of the number of accounts set up already			2
spotting : the app 's users will first choose from a drop - down list of parking violations and snap a picture , which digitally records the gps location of a car and its license plate number ' we 're getting the feeling this is the kind of thing everyone [ is going to want to have ] on their phone but no one admits to , ' he said			1
report : when users rack - up a lot of successful reports , they 'll get an increasingly larger cut of the parking fine , which is first paid to the mobile company @entity66 told @entity12 , that the photos and users ' reports ca n't be used in court , so official evidence must be collected by those parking operators and traffic cops who get word of the violation			2
a pilot program of the app should begin in @entity17 by july , but @entity66 said he sees an opportunity to expand the app 's reach in @entity113			1
' we 're open to having conversations anywhere where there 's parking that needs to be controlled , ' @entity66 told @entity69			2
a similar , though less self - serving , app is already used in @entity113			1
@entity119 allows trained volunteers to snap shots of cars illegally parked in disabled spots			0
a portion of the fines from those reports are given to the user 's favorite charity			0
that @entity130 - based company took years to negotiate agreements with police departments and cities , @entity69 reported			0
the @entity15 app might cause some legal issues , lawyer @entity134 told @entity137			1
users would n't be bound by the same privacy laws as public sector workers who document illegally parked cars			0
' you are empowering citizens and paying them to arguably act as an agent for you , ' @entity134 said			0
it also has the potential to tick - off those whose cars are reported			0
' just read the signs , follow the rules and you wo nâ€™t have a problem , ' @entity66 told @entity12 .			0
