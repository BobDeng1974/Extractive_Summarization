this is just one of the incredible light trail photos taken by @entity7 in @entity9 's beautiful @entity8			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity10 , took anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour to produce the pictures , which are created by using a long exposure photo and a head torch			1
@entity7 , from @entity10 , took anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour to produce the pictures			1
above , @entity16 in @entity9 's @entity8 mr @entity7 had to endure freezing temperatures as well as navigate along treacherous rock using only the minimal light available			1
above , @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 the 34 - year - old , who also climbed @entity20 , in @entity21 , @entity22 , had to endure freezing temperatures while navigating a course along treacherous rock , using only the minimal light available			1
during one climb , he had to complete the ascent on his own and without ropes			0
and on a landmark known as @entity31 , he had to climb the @entity8 rock by painfully jamming his hands into cracks			1
he said : ' i got to the top of the first climb , where the rock was covered with ice			0
' as i was climbing solo and ropeless , this gave me a few scary moments until i found a way round - the climbs are around 60ft high			0
on a landmark known as @entity31 in the @entity8 ( above ) , mr @entity7 had to climb the rock by painfully jamming his hands into cracks ' @entity49 was strenuous and a little painful , but keeping my hands in the cracks also means that i felt secure			1
' there was no danger of slipping off unexpectedly but i knew i would have to get to the top before i got too tired or my hands got too cold			0
' mr @entity7 prides himself on his ability to capture star trails within his amazing photographs			1
he said : ' the star trails in the sky are formed when the stars appear to move in the sky due to @entity62 spinning on its axis , just as the sun does			0
' as the @entity67 - @entity66 - is above the @entity68 , it appears stationary and the other stars seem to move round it			0
@entity7 ( pictured ) , 34 , plans to continue to make light trails and hopes to take his talent overseas			2
he has also created an incredible ' little planet ' set of pictures by taking a panorama photo and then warping it and manipulating it in @entity77 - including @entity78 , near @entity79 , @entity9 ( right ) ' any exposure of longer than a few seconds will result in some star movement being captured			2
' also notice that the colours of the stars are different			0
we do n’t normally see this as our eyes ca n’t see well in colour when it is very dim			0
' mr @entity7 plans to continue to make the light trails and hopes to take his talent overseas			2
the experimental photographer had previously created an incredible ' little planet ' set of pictures by taking a panorama photo and then warping it and manipulating it in @entity77			2
for that project , he captured amazing scenes in the @entity97 , the @entity98 and places closer to home , such as tors in @entity9 , and @entity102 .			0
