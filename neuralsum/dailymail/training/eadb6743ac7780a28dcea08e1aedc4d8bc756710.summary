it is not against rules to remove life rafts from 737s that do not travel more than 400 nautical miles off the coast			1
however , the rafts save lives and contain radios and rations for passengers if a plane crashes or is forced to make an emergency landing			0
mr @entity16 wrote to @entity2 chief executive @entity43 asking him to rule out the idea as a matter of urgency			1
' if a plane has to ditch off shore , every minute counts , and the savings are a joke			0

risky : it is not against rules to remove life rafts from 737s that do not travel more than 400 nautical miles off the coast concerned : @entity17 independent senator @entity16 ( left ) reportedly wrote to @entity2 chief executive @entity43 ( right ) asking him to rule out the idea as a matter of urgency regulations demand planes should have enough rafts to carry every person on board the plane , unless they are only flying within certain parameters			1
