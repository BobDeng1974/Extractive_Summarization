critics say engineering genius and @entity42 founder @entity2 , who founded the firm 94 years ago , would be turning in his grave along with generations of ‘ @entity46 ’ who treasure the car - maker			1
its luxury vehicles are also famously a favourite of @entity52			0
the new @entity20 is set to go on sale from 2015 - 16 and will be a central plank in plans to double the luxury car - maker sales to 15,000 by 2018 accounting for between a quarter and a third of all global sales			2

@entity77 , a ‘ motivated ’ @entity5 workforce , and the logical cost of transporting parts between @entity5 and @entity70 were in its favour , they added			1

@entity42 ’s chairman and chief executive dr @entity89 said the decision on where to build up to 4,000 of the cars was one of the ‘ last hurdles ’ to be cleared as executives finalise the business case			0
he said there was plenty of room to build the new @entity42 at @entity18 and that capacity ‘ is not the issue			1
’ key deciding factors will be labour rates , logistical costs , finance and craftsmanship			0

’ ’ we want to build sustainable cars that make money , ' he said			0
‘ we have the components and the craftsmanship skills in @entity18			2
' dr @entity89 and his two most senior @entity42 board members - including sales and marketing director @entity131 , a @entity132 - said they would prefer the model to be built in @entity18			1

dr @entity89 said : ’ we are all fighting for the best decision for @entity2			1
‘ everyone in @entity66 knows how motivated and skilled the workers in @entity18 are			2
their interior craftsmanship is a true asset			0
’ ' best decision for @entity42 ' : bosses said the craftsmanship and skill of @entity2 's @entity18 - based workforce was a ' true asset ' @entity2 did build some @entity152 models in the eastern @entity7 city of @entity154 during 2005 and 2006 because of a shortage of capacity at @entity18			1
but building the off - roader in @entity4 would be the first time a complete new model would have been built abroad			1
however , interior components would have to be shipped from @entity18 to ensure a luxury feel			2
potential buyers have already placed more than 2,000 pre-orders even before the final showroom styling of the car has been revealed			2
@entity42 ’s chief finance officer @entity166 said ‘ stability ’ was a key issue in the decision			0
the possibility of @entity5 leaving the @entity72 - added to currency fluctuations between the @entity172 and the pound - were among issues being considered			1
final styling of the new car has already been signed off and will be very different from that shown on a much criticised ‘ concept ’ version which appeared at last year ’s @entity179			0

it has the dna of the current cars but looks even more special			0
’ global sales director @entity131 said the new @entity109 would begin in price and prestige where the new rival @entity192 leaves off			0
about half of all sales will come from the @entity196 and @entity197 followed by the @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity17			0
some 87.3 per cent of @entity2 ’s cars are already exported			2
