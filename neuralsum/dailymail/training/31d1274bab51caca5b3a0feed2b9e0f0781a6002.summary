by @entity0 a serial killer in @entity2 is boasting of his murder streak with a sickening tattoo that has left prison officials scratching their heads to figure out how the death row inmate even got inked in the first place			1
the marking — ' @entity10 ' — covers most of the back of @entity13 's head , in a clear reference to the three women he 's admitted to having sexually attacked and brutally killed			1
@entity13 's tattoo makes it pretty clear how he feels about his crimes			1
officials , meanwhile , are still trying to figure out who let him get the tattoo , which was only pictured on july 30 because no cameras are allowed inside @entity2 courtrooms guilty : @entity13 has been convicted in one murder and pleaded guilty to another two			2
in all cases , he admitted to sexually assaulting his victims , ranging in age from 35 to 75 but ever since @entity13 showed up with the tattoo in court in march , officials at the @entity31 jail and the state @entity33 have been passing the buck on who let the inmate get inked			1
@entity13 has been in police custody since april 2012 , when he was first arrested for strangling @entity40 , 35 , and @entity41 , 75 , along with the 2002 stabbing death of @entity43 , 44			0
' when they took him to corrections and released him over to [ @entity48 ] , his head was completely shaved at that point , and no tattooing was visible at that time , ' sheriff @entity44 told @entity51 3			0
but over on death row , the story is the exact opposite			1
officials there have shifted the blame to the county jailers , saying that if he 'd been tattooed while in state custody , @entity13 would have been written up			1
' he was held at high security risk and maximum security while in my facility , ' sheriff @entity62 countered			0
' we know the tattooing did n't occur here			0
' last fall , @entity13 was sentenced to death for the murder of his mother 's best friend , @entity41 , who was found mutilated inside his garage			2
then in march of this year , @entity13 pleaded guilty to killing @entity43 and was sentenced to 65 years in prison for the crime			2
@entity43 was stabbed to death in 2002 , and her body was found near the @entity75 in @entity76 at the beginning of 2003			0
@entity13 is standing trial for the murder of @entity40 , whose remains were found buried in his s backyard			0
he 's already pleaded guilty to the death , but the trial is necessary to determine if he 'll be sentenced to death @entity13 was sentenced to death last fall for the murder of his mother 's best friend , 75 - year - old @entity41 ( left ) , who was found mutilated inside his garage			2
in march of this year , he pleaded guilty to killing @entity43 ( right ) , and was sentenced to 65 years in prison for the crime he is currently standing trial for the murder of @entity87 ' , whose remains were found buried in @entity13 's backyard			1
he 's already pleaded guilty to the death , but the trial is necessary to determine if he 'll be sentenced to death			0
district attorney @entity91 , who is prosecuting @entity13 on the latest charges , said the tattoo could be damaging because it might make it difficult for a jury to see @entity13 impartially			0
' it potentially affects the prosecution of a very important case , ' he told @entity99			0
' and , quite frankly , i think there needs to be some sort of explanation from the @entity33 on how that can occur when somebody 's on death row			1

@entity13 branded the back of his head in a clear reference to the three women he 's admitted to killing
jail and prison officials continue to accuse each other of letting the death row inmate get tattooed — despite *mandated* solitary *confinement*
