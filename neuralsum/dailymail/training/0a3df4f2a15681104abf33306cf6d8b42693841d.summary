@entity7 , 67 , among the longest - serving @entity1 death row inmates , had been scheduled for lethal injection tuesday			1
the justices gave no reason for the reprieve , saying only that it would be lifted automatically if they deny an appeal or act on it			0
@entity15 was convicted in the october 1983 deaths at a @entity18 ranch about 60 miles north of @entity19			1
authorities found parts from a small ultralight airplane at the hangar at his home in @entity26 , a @entity19 suburb			0

@entity15 , set to be executed next week for fatally shooting four men at an airplane hangar more than 30 years ago , won a reprieve thursday from the @entity6 @entity5 he asked for a delay so the @entity5 could consider his appeal , which is pending at the court			1
the next time the nine justices are scheduled to meet to discuss new cases to take up is february 20			1
in their appeal to the high court , @entity15 's lawyers said jurors who decided on his death sentence had faulty instructions that did n't allow them to consider mitigating circumstances that he had no criminal record , was a married father of two , college educated and employed as a chemical salesman			1
since his 1984 trial , court rulings have refined instructions to @entity1 capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances			2
several condemned inmates from that era — but not @entity15 — have received new court - ordered punishment trials			2
@entity15 's attorneys also contended that prosecutors misstated the rarity of the fatal bullets , and that his long time on death row and numerous rescheduled execution dates amount to unconstitutional suffering			1
state attorneys argued that courts have rejected appeals about the jury instructions , that information about the bullets was available at the time of his trial and that @entity15 's lawyers ' persistent appeals account for the lengthy case			1
among the legal questions that @entity15 has raised is whether the @entity6 @entity94 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment has been violated by his more than 30 - year stay on death row			1
' any delay is purely of his own making , ' @entity98 , an assistant @entity1 attorney general , told the justices in a filing this week			1
ominous evidence : trial evidence that was used in case against @entity106 , is shown in the @entity108 's office wednesday in @entity109 , @entity1			1
three months after four bodies were found shot execution - style in an airplane hangar on the @entity113 north of @entity19 , @entity15 , a chemical salesman , was charged with capital murder a jury deliberated just two hours before convicting @entity7 , then deliberated only two hours more the following day before deciding he should die for the crime			2
no fingerprints put him at the scene			0
no witnesses saw him there			0
the murder weapon never was found			0
dna testing was n't available then			0
he had lied to his wife and to authorities about his efforts to buy an ultralight plane ; she did n't want him flying such a flimsy craft			0
he sold firearms on the side , including the kind that fired the ammunition used to kill the men			0
convicted in 1984 : seen here in his younger days , @entity15 has now been on death row longer than nearly any other @entity1 inmate ' i was quite capable of purchasing whatever i need without killing four people , ' @entity15 said in 2008 after a state judge stopped stopped his execution scheduled that summer			1
' virtually no one , except for the prosecution , thinks this sounds like anything i would do			0
' @entity15 says he had a good job and was a family man , father of two daughters , with a stable marriage			2
' an absolutely stellar record , ' @entity15 said			2
' then one day , as the prosecutor says , i snapped , killed four people and snapped back			0
those are his words , not mine			0
' i 'm not minimizing that people do n't snap ... does this really sound like something i would do ? ' yes , prosecutors insist			0
@entity163 and @entity18 prosecutors built a circumstantial case surrounding @entity15 's purchase of the ultralight airplane from sheriff 's deputy @entity167 , 29			1
the aircraft was stored at a hangar owned by building contractor @entity170 , 51			1
@entity170 ; good ; @entity172 , 52 , a @entity109 interior designer ; and @entity173 , 39 , a former @entity109 police officer , were all killed at the hangar			1
@entity15 acknowledges he lied to the @entity175 about his involvement in the purchase of the plane			2
he said @entity172 was with @entity167 that saturday afternoon when he was negotiating the down payment of $ 3,000 , or 75 percent , on the airplane			1
they all waited about 15 minutes for @entity170 to show up with a key to the hangar			2
@entity15 said he never saw @entity184			2
evidence at trial centered on @entity15 's two purchases in 1982 , when he lived in @entity189 , @entity190 , of @entity29 - made @entity192 - brand .22 - caliber ammunition , the kind used in the killings			1
there also was evidence he had owned a .22 - caliber @entity199 pistol , which prosecutors said was fitted with a silencer he made			0
@entity15 had a federal firearms dealer license			2
prosecutors showed jurors his books about guns and gun parts , a @entity199 target pistol manual and a book about silencers			0
among evidence and trial exhibits still stored in cardboard boxes at the courthouse are four plastic foam heads , the kind used to display wigs			0
these four , however , have long blue knitting needles stuck in them , representing the paths bullets took to kill each person			0
was it enough ? among the evidence used by the prosecution was the type of bullets used in 1983 killings , an @entity29 - made .22 caliber that @entity15 's defenders now say prosecutors unfairly characterized as rare after offering evidence he 'd purchased such bullets the year before @entity236 , jr. v. @entity1 prosecutors said @entity15 was obsessed with the aircraft and stole it			1
@entity15 has said he was at the hangar to purchase the aircraft and the men were alive when he left			2
those killed were building contractor @entity170 , 51 ; @entity18 sheriff 's deputy @entity167 , 29 ; @entity172 , 52 , an interior designer ; and @entity173 , 39 , a former @entity109 police officer			1
@entity167 's wife , @entity246 , said the delay was ' very frustrating since we were so close			1
' ' i am hoping once this is done he will be out of options , we can get another death warrant and end this , ' she said in an email			0
police looking through her slain husband 's phone records spotted several calls from @entity15 , and he lied to investigators when they contacted him			1
' not cooperating with authorities was the biggest mistake , ' @entity15 told @entity265 last month			2
' and i paid for it with my life			0
a lot of us have done some crazy things			0
' he insisted the presence of the disassembled aircraft at his house should not be incriminating			0
' they ca n't prove it was stolen and i ca n't prove i bought it , ' he said			0
' they have four dead men			0
it 's too good a story , so they say i stole it			0
' second chance sentencing ? since his 1984 trial , court rulings have refined instructions to @entity1 capital murder trial juries to account for mitigating circumstances			2
several condemned inmates from that era — but not @entity15 — have received new court - ordered punishment trials			0

@entity296 has been on death row longer than almost anyone in @entity1 history after a conviction based on circumstantial evidence
@entity15 's lethal injection scheduled for tuesday is now delayed after asked for a delay so the @entity5 could consider his appeal
