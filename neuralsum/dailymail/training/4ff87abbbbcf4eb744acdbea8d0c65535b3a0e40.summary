packed : @entity0 and @entity1 are set to create 50 new peers this week and 100 over two years around 15 are expected to be @entity9 , including @entity19 , the businessman who brought @entity20 to @entity21 and gave £ 775,000 to the party			1
the plans put mr @entity0 on course to create the most peers in a @entity26 of any prime minister in recent memory			2
he has already ennobled 125 at a rate of nearly 50 a year , compared with an average of 35 for @entity31 and only 15 for @entity32			0
