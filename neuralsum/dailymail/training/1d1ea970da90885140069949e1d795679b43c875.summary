. @entity17 police detective constable @entity49 warned people about the consequences of taking legal highs			2
he said : ' the clear issue is people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs they read on - line are a substitute for controlled drugs			0
' people incorrectly believe these " legal highs " are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs			0
' just because something is not illegal does not make it safe			0
' unfortunately , it appears anyone can call anything a " legal high " and sell it as " safe "			0
