a scientific breakthrough has offered a glimpse into the vicious circle of negative thinking suffered by people with @entity5			1
researchers have discovered that the part of the brain associated with feelings of guilt is also highly active in people with @entity5			1
the findings , published by @entity14 scientists today , could lead to new ways of treating the distressing disorder			0
the new findings could lead to new ways of treating the distressing disorder , suffered by @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) a key characteristic of @entity5 is believing that negative thoughts will become a reality , leading to a spiralling build - up of anxiety and guilt			1
celebrities such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity28 have spoken of their struggles with @entity5 , which is one of the least understood mental illnesses			1
it is thought to affect around 12 people in every 1,000 in @entity14			0
the new study looked at brain wave patterns in people with varying degrees of @entity5 symptoms			1
scientists from @entity40 in @entity41 and the @entity42 found that feelings of anxiety and guilt were associated with increased activity in a brain region called the precuneus			1
previous research has linked the precuneus with the processing of self - attribution , responsibility , causal reasoning , and ‘ moral transgression ’ guilt			1
psychopaths , who lack a sense of guilt , have been shown to possess a small precuneus			2
the new study looked at brain wave patterns in people with varying degrees of @entity5 symptoms			1
@entity28 is another sufferer professor @entity62 , from @entity40 , said : ‘ ocd sufferers experience more guilt and anxiety out of the kind of negative thoughts we might all have from time to time			2
‘ for example they might imagine a loved one dying in a car crash and believe that somehow it increases the chances that it will actually happen			0
‘ once they have these thoughts they feel guilty and subsequently make attempts to suppress and neutralise them , but fail , so entering into a vicious circle			0
’ many people with the condition report they can not stop thoughts and images intruding in the mind			0
the condition is often marked by obsessive , repetitive behaviour aimed at reducing anxiety			0
some of the least disabling forms of the disorder can add an extra hour to the day ’s routine , causing distress and interfering with daily life			0
some people are so affected that they can not leave their homes			0
the study , published in the journal @entity98 , found that precuneus activity was greater in individuals with more extreme @entity5 symptoms			1
activity increased when an individual experienced greater ‘ thought - action fusion ’ - the belief that a negative event will become reality			2
co-author dr @entity108 , from the @entity42 , said : ‘ these findings could possibly prove to be a significant step towards treating @entity5			2
‘ our next step is to use brain stimulation methods to attempt to modify thought - action fusion			0
that will allow us to confirm the causal role of these neural findings , and hopefully find a way to reduce these harmful thought - cycles			0

part of the brain linked to guilt is also highly active in people with @entity5
feelings of anxiety and guilt were associated with increased activity in a brain region called the precuneus
