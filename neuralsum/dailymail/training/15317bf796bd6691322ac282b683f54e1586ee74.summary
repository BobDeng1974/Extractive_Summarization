she was so large that she could barely walk and was unable to play properly with her young sons as she was too unfit ms @entity4 ( pictured before her weight loss ) says she started piling on the pounds as a teenager because she became hooked on pizza and takeaways ‘ i just ate loads of takeaways and pizza and also i went out a lot so i drank a lot of alcohol			1
‘ the main problem was i was not eating properly and would skip breakfast and then just eat packaged sandwiches for lunch and have takeaways in the evening			2
‘ there would always be that feeling of being the fat friend and if i was in a shop with friends they would be picking out all the nice clothes but there would n’t be anything in my size			0
‘ i used to have to buy all my clothes online and i would have to prepare outfits months in advance			0

she says she was extremely embarrassed by the experience ‘ i felt really isolated when i was overweight and i could barely walk , i was so unfit			0
‘ but the turning point was when i pretty much derailed a train in @entity23			0
‘ it was mortifying , i just wanted to cry but i held it all in			0
the carriageway just gave way and i dislodged it			0
‘ the driver called back when the train would n’t move and said “ there is too much weight in the back ” and it was obviously me			2
ms @entity4 ( pictured before her weight loss ) says she was so fat that she was embarrassed to go shopping with her friends and avoided parties as she could barely walk ms @entity4 said : ' getting to a size 12 was amazing , i had n't been a size 12 since i was a young teenager			1
buying my first size 12 trousers and dresses was so good ' ‘ we then had to swap with a family who were sat in the middle of the carriage and he had to re-attach the carriage			1
‘ it was terrible , i can remember people were sniggering and giggling as we moved but i just tried to ignore it			0
‘ it was in the middle of the holiday and for the rest of the week i just felt so self - conscious , it really affected me			0
i realised i had to lose the weight			0
’ she added : ‘ when i joined @entity30 it all changed			1
it was a diet that broke the weight loss down into manageable stages			0
‘ initially i just wanted to get down to 13 stone but when i got there i realised i could carry on			0
ms @entity4 has been named as a finalist in the @entity30 district @entity122 competition and has even set up her own @entity123 , which she now runs once a week ‘ getting to a size 12 was amazing , i had n’t been a size 12 since i was a young teenager			1
buying my first size 12 trousers and dresses was so good			2
‘ now i eat regular meals and following @entity30 ’s plan i never feel hungry and i exercise regularly			0
i run two to three times a week			0
‘ i can easily play with my two boys and although my youngest @entity133 is only two - years - old , @entity28 is five - years - old so he has encouraged me through the weight loss			2
‘ he would say things like “ how many stones is mummy now ? ” and he is much more aware of what he eats and like to be healthy with me			0
