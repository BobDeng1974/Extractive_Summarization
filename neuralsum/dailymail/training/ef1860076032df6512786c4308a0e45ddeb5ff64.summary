@entity1 @entity0 has created a unique memento of 2014 - by taking a selfie every day of the year and posting the pictures on @entity5			1
the 27 - year - old set himself the challenge to take a daily snap of himself to document his activities over the last 12 months			1
the 365 snaps include selfies with relatives and professional footballers and @entity16 , at family weddings and on holiday			2
he managed to secure his sporting heroes , former @entity28 legend , @entity31 and the team 's striker @entity32 , for two photos			2
@entity0 's selection of snaps also acts as a reminder of the fads and crazes that defined 2014 , and included the @entity40 , which took the web by storm throughout august			1
@entity0 , of @entity43 , @entity44 , said : ' the idea started off as a joke suggestion really but my friends seemed to like it and encouraged me to take it up			1
' i 'm not a keen photographer by any means and at first i was struggling for ideas but by the end of january i could n't give up , i was in too deep			2
@entity0 started 2014 in the @entity28 ticket office with sporting heroes @entity31 , left , and @entity32 , right @entity0 took a screen shot from a video so he could have a photograph of himself doing the ice bucket challenge @entity0 went on to say : ' i started the year working at the @entity28 ticket office , and got to meet some footballing idols , like @entity31 and @entity32			1
' i have had a lot of fun , i guess i picked quite a good year in general			2
looking back , i seem to have spent the majority of my time with friends , family and work colleagues			2
' the @entity40 one was very nearly a disaster			0
my dad shot the video and he is n't very good with phones , so he stopped filming pretty much as soon as the water went over my head			0
' i had to screen shot it and take a photo from that , which luckily worked out pretty well			0
' @entity0 said that this picture - taken with his great @entity79 @entity80 and his @entity81 - was especially poignant as his @entity82 died not long after the picture was taken @entity0 was best man for his friends @entity85 and @entity86 in august and captured the moment for his picture diary as an aspiring @entity0 , @entity0 took the opportunity to take part in a meet - and - greet with @entity91 electro duo @entity92 during his weekend at @entity94			1
he said : ' while i was at @entity94 , there was a signing tent where acts will sit for a couple of hours and meet their fans			0
' i am a big fan of @entity92 and was planning to go and see them later on in the day			0
as i walked past the tent , i noticed they were doing a signing but it looked pretty much finished , everyone was packing up			0
when @entity0 was at @entity94 he managed to persuade @entity108 to be part of his challenge ( left ) , he also shared pictures with his friends at @entity113 in @entity114 on his last day at work for @entity116 persuaded his colleagues to take part in his picture ' i had a word with security and told them about my selfie challenge and they let me through			1
the guys seemed to think it was a good idea too and were more than happy to pose			0
my friend said that had to be my photo for that day			0
' then at @entity131 's @entity130 , which is a three day electronic music event , i got a photo with @entity134 from @entity135			0
' @entity0 said that his family would regularly feature in his pictures : ' there are loads of pictures with family as well			1
we are a very close family			0
we like to get together a lot anyway and take photographs so they were happy to join in			0
the wannabe dj always had his camera on hand to document his goings on , taking this snap on a night out some of @entity0 's friends were less keen to be part of his mission to take a seflie every day for a year @entity0 had a great time at @entity94 taking snaps with his friends along the way ' one especially significant photograph shows me with my great aunt @entity80 , who had cancer and died a few months after the picture was taken			1
' other snaps include @entity0 taking part in the @entity25 half marathon dressed as the 118 man as well as pictures of himself with girlfriend @entity168 , 27 , on holiday			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's strange that we got together last december so she has only known me as this guy who takes photographs every day			1
@entity0 's @entity176 photo , not long before his challenge of taking pictures every day for a year was over but @entity168 's not too keen on @entity0 doing the challenge again this year : ' i think she wants me to pick a different @entity180 for 2015 , sometimes hunting for photographs can become quite tiresome for others			1
' but there 's also one from when i was best man for my mate @entity183			0
we have known each other all our lives , our parents are best friends and so are we			2
' that was a special day and it 's nice to have got a photo with the happy couple			0
at times i have felt a little strange constantly taking photographs			0
' i must have looked crazy to others , but i have a priceless memento of this year that i will never lose			2
' @entity0 's girlfriend hopes he does n't repeat the challenge in 2015 as she is tired of his taking photos of himself @entity0 took 365 selfies in 2014 , all pictured above , to capture his year of meeting heroes and seeing family			1

aspiring dj @entity0 , from @entity44 , wanted to remember his year
he took pictures of his loved ones , friends and famous *people* he met
his girlfriend , @entity168 , does not want him to repeat the challenge this year
