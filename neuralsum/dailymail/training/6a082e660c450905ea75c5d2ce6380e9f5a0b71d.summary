pregnant women in the workplace have been told to consider an abortion , belittled and called ' placenta brain ' by colleagues , a new report has revealed			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 to work @entity8 , was released on friday , found that one in two women and one in four men have experienced discrimination during pregnancy , parental leave or upon returning to work			1
the first national inquiry into pregnancy discrimination in the workforce was conducted 15 years ago however not much progress has been made since then , sex discrimination commissioner @entity15 wrote in the recent report			1
' working while pregnant is still often seen as a privilege , not a right			0
not only that , this view extends to parents on return to work			1
discrimination continues to be widespread and has a cost - not just to women , working parents and their families - but also to workplaces and the national economy			1
' the commission report , which surveyed 2000 mothers and 1000 fathers , further found that the nature of discrimination involved pregnant women being perceived as an inconvenience and liability in the workplace			1
' when i told my supervisor i was pregnant , the response was " well , you will need to leave - this is very inconvenient for the organisation - you should have told us that you were planning this - have you considered [ an ] abortion ? " , ' one woman said			2
other inappropriate comments involved a woman who was belittled by a colleague			0
' one of the other men in the office had started calling me " placenta brain " when i was pregnant , ' she said			2
another woman was told she ' was no longer an asset to the business , just a liability '			0
women also reported receiving no support from managers about their family obligations			2
' it was relayed to me that now that i have a child that i should focus on that more and not be so hungry to be progressive in my career			0
that by offering me this lower job they were allowing me to be a better mother , ' one woman said			0
other incidents involved a female manager telling a mother that she had to choose between a family or a senior role in the company as ' it 's a myth you can have both '			2
almost one in five mothers indicated that they were made redundant , restructured , dismissed or their contract was not renewed either during their pregnancy , when they requested or took parental leave or when they returned to work			1
one pregnant woman who suffered from morning sickness says she was told that she was spending too much time in the bathroom and not enough on the shop floor			0
' even though he [ the boss ] knew i had morning sickness , he 'd text me while i was vomiting and tell me to get back onto the floor immediately , ' the woman said			0
' i had bad back and leg pain , but i was n't allowed to sit down			0
if i did , he 'd click his fingers at me like i was a dog and tell me to stand up			0
' nothing was done when the woman made a complaint to @entity115			0
ms @entity15 says the review does seek to devalue the role undertaken by parents and carers nor does it aim to push women into paid work			1
' what it seeks to do is to ensure that discrimination is no longer the reason that women opt out of the paid workforce , ' she said			1
' just as we all have a right to family , we also have a right to paid work			2
if we work together , we can create workplaces where pregnancy , parental leave and return to work discrimination have no place			1
' we can ensure that three years from now , when we release the next prevalence survey , the outlook it captures will be considerably brighter			0
