by @entity0 a couple are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10 month old son after he and his twin brother were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks			1
@entity6 , 32 and partner @entity7 , 28 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , find their happiness is tainted by heartache as they grieve the tragic death of their second son			1
despite the best efforts of medical teams , baby @entity17 only survived an hour after his delivery , while his brother @entity21 fought for his life in hospital for six months			1
alongside @entity6 and @entity7 's joy at @entity21 's recovery and homecoming , they are still grieving the tragic lost of his twin brother @entity17 when @entity6 , a trained nanny and @entity7 , a plumber , were told that she was expecting twins eight weeks into her pregnancy they were thrilled			1
but at 23 weeks @entity6 suffered a heavy bleed with stomach pains and a worried @entity7 rushed her to hospital where she was told she was in labour			1
she says : ‘ i knew already it was one week before the abortion limit			0
@entity21 ( right ) and @entity17 ( left ) were born at just 23 weeks weighing 1lb 10grams and 1lb respectively ‘ i could n’t believe what i was hearing			1
i pleaded with doctors to do everything they could for the twins as long as it would n’t be cruel			0
’ their local hospital was n’t specialist enough , and @entity6 was transferred to a specialist premature baby unit at another hospital , an hour away			1
there , they told her that her twin boys had little chance of survival and that even if they did survive they ’d be severally mentally and physically handicapped			2
she says : ‘ they told us to prepare for the worst , it was the most terrifying moment of our lives			0
’ @entity6 ’s labour lasted four agonising hours			1
@entity17 arrived first , weighing 1lb but he was breach and badly damaged			1
his shoulders and back had been broken during his birth and his skin was bruised			0
@entity6 with @entity21 , who was critically ill at birth , requiring a total of 19 blood transfusions to keep him alive the second twin @entity21 was born a few minutes later , just 10g bigger			1
he cried , and was taken straight off to an incubator			0
@entity6 says : ‘ this should have been the happiest time of our lives - instead me and @entity7 never felt so afraid			1
‘ i sat up in bed holding little @entity17			2
we sang @entity71 to him and i held him close so he ’d feel the warmth of my skin			0
the family held a small service for @entity76 ‘ when his body went cold after an hour and a half we knew he ’d gone			0
‘ afterwards i did n’t know how i could carry on			0
but like @entity7 i knew we needed to stay strong for @entity21			1
’ @entity21 was critically ill , suffering a brain bleed hours after birth and doctors told the couple to prepare to say goodbye			1
however miraculously @entity21 survived his first few days			1
then the medical team discovered a hole in his heart and although the doctors managed to close it with medication , @entity21 suffered a massive bleed on his lungs - nearly drowning him in his own blood			1
@entity92 and @entity7 prepared to say goodbye but @entity21 fought back , again and again as he suffered a further two major bleeds			1
things looked their bleakest when he caught pneumonia and his lungs collapsed			0
then he caught a stomach infection , which causes the intestines to die			0
doctors pumped his tiny body with steroids and antibiotics			0
then when his retinas started to detach he needed injections in his eyes to save his sight			0
@entity6 says : ‘ doctors said they were running out of options			2
but we ’d already lost one baby , we could n’t bare the thought of losing @entity21 too			2
we were living on a knife edge			0
‘ but despite needing 19 blood transfusions @entity21 kept going			2
we spent every second we could by his incubator praying he ’d pull through			0
’ in the meantime the couple had to bury their other son @entity17			2
@entity21 was in hospital for over 6 months , recovering from several potentially fatal conditions @entity6 says : ‘ we held a small service with close family			1
it felt like my heart was breaking as they took his tiny coffin away to be buried			2
‘ after the funeral the couple were back at the hospital by @entity21 ’s side			1
‘ he ’d cheated death so many times it was as though he had a guardian angel			0
‘ maybe it was his brother , there was no other explanation			0
‘ and the doctors could n’t explain it			0
they told us that they ’d never seen anything like it			0
’ although @entity21 , now 10 months , still requires oxygen to assist with his breathing , his brain functions are normal and he constantly improving for weeks @entity21 battled for his life , surprising them each time they thought he could n’t take anymore , and slowly he began to put on weight and stabilise			1
finally after six months he was allowed home , and since , he ’s been going from strength to strength			0
‘ @entity6 says : ‘ he ’s doing so well , he ’s turned into a right little tinker and now weighs nearly a stone ! ‘ all his brain functions are fine now and although he still needs help with his breathing and has an oxygen canister at home , it ’s constantly improving each time he goes for his check ups			2
‘ one day we ’ll sit him down and tell him about his big brother @entity17			2
‘ we ’re proud of him too and grateful for the brief moment we had him in our lives			0
