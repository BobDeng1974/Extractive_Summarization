snapchat co-founder @entity0 said sponsored posts will appear on @entity3 ' soon ' , but they 'll only show up on the app 's stories feature despite not having a regular source of revenue , @entity3 was recently valued in the region of $ 10 billion ( £ 6 billion )			1
but that is about to change after co-founder @entity0 revealed plans to show adverts on the app. the 24 - year - old developer told @entity15 's @entity14 that sponsored posts will appear on @entity3 ' soon ' , but they 'll only show up on the app 's stories feature			1
snapchat stories add snaps together to create a narrative			0
when a user adds a snap to a story it lives for 24 hours before it disappears , making room for the new			0
mr @entity0 said : ' people are going to see the first ads on @entity3 soon			1
we think they 're pretty cool			0
' he added that the adverts will be opt - in , and users can choose to look at them , or skip			1
and unlike adverts on @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity3 's ads would not be targeted at unique users , they will just be added to a story for whoever is looking at the app , at that time			1
the exact date that the ads will appear was not revealed			1
@entity37 has used targeted advertising for years , and its @entity36 app began rolling out sponsored posts to the @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49 from june			1
@entity37 also recently released ' local awareness ' ads that help local business promote themselves to users			0
earlier this week , reports claimed @entity55 was reportedly preparing to invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in @entity3			2
despite not yet having a source of revenue , more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums on the three - year old startup			2
@entity55 ’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity65 and @entity66 in august			0
@entity37 has used targeted advertising for years , and its @entity36 app began rolling out sponsored posts ( pictured left ) to the @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49 from june			1
@entity37 also recently released ' local awareness ' ads that help local business promote themselves to users ( pictured right ) earlier this week , reports said @entity75 - based @entity55 ( ceo @entity74 shown making her keynote address in january 2014 ) is planning to invest £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) in the three year - old tech startup			1
if true the investment would value the company at £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) the move comes after a similar , albeit much larger , investment in @entity82 technology firm @entity80 reaped huge dividends for @entity55 , with its $ 1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars			1
this latest move , according to the @entity86 , comes as @entity3 starts to seek funding from venture - capital firms , money managers and companies			2
earlier this year @entity36 launched a new ephemeral messaging app called @entity93			1
the app , which functions in a similar way to @entity3 , allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend			2
like @entity3 , the user can tap on a friend 's face to instantly send a photo , or hold their finger down to send a video			2
however , @entity93 only allows you to send messages to one person at a time , which makes it frustrating if you ’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends			0
the favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends , though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total			0
@entity93 is currently only available in @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world			0
snapchat may be a key partner to @entity55 as it gets set to release @entity130 next year			2
this is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app , which will likely become a key source of revenue for @entity3			1
@entity130 would provide a platform for @entity55 to distribute its own content			0
however , the £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) valuation of a company that has n't , yet , monetised its users , has been dubbed a risky proposition			1
that ’s not to say it has n’t worked before ; @entity147 ’s 2007 investment in @entity37 valued the then three - year old company at £ 9.4 billion ( $ 15 billion ) , and later proved hugely successful			1
last year @entity3 infamously turned down a £ 1.8 billion ( $ 3 billion ) offer from @entity37 - a decision that left many stunned			1
but the move seems to have paid off , as @entity3 ’s owners @entity0 and @entity153 are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company			2
if the valuation holds true , @entity3 would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £ 6 billion ( $ 10 billion ) or more , including car - ride service uber and rooms - to - let startup @entity163			1
@entity55 's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm @entity65 and @entity66 in august this year			0
pictured are owners @entity0 , left , and @entity153 @entity3 lets users send photo - messages that vanish within seconds , but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services			2
this may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users			0
although @entity3 , and other similar mobile messaging apps , do n't have established business models yet , its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so			2
@entity3 is continuing to grow in popularity , with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day			0
in june , @entity37 launched a similar app called @entity187 in the hope of replicating @entity3 ’s success			0
the app lets consumers exchange photos and videos , which later disappear , without requiring @entity37 accounts			0
but despite its rapid growth , @entity3 has had a number of obstacles to contend with			0
the group this year settled charges with @entity47 regulators , which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time			0
according to the @entity209 at the time , photos sent on @entity3 could , in fact , be saved by recipients using several methods , such as taking a screenshot .			0

@entity3 's @entity0 said sponsored posts will appear on the app ' soon '
but they 'll be opt - in , and only show up on the app 's stories feature
the exact date that the ads will appear was not revealed
the ephemeral messaging app was recently valued at $ 10 billion ( £ 6 billion )
other rumours *suggest* @entity3 will soon *introduce* news to the service
this could include @entity130 next year - a service that will display brief adverts alongside news and video clips on the app
