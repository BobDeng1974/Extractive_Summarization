@entity2 ’s £ 4,000 grave is to be dismantled on orders of his family ' out of respect for public opinion ' , it was announced yesterday			2
the astonishing u-turn by the @entity2 family was revealed only minutes after the @entity10 press conference			2
sources said the relatives were ' emotionally drained ' by the sheer force of the allegations as police announced a huge inquiry into allegations that sir @entity2 ' sexually assaulted underage girls over four decades '			1
@entity19 said they are due to investigate 120 lines of inquiry from alleged victims , witnesses and third - parties			1
the late sir @entity2 has been accused of abusing girls in his dressing room the number of the late @entity30 's alleged victims is reported to be between 20 and 25 victims , some of whom were underage when the abuse happened , it is claimed			1
@entity19 has formally recorded eight criminal allegations against the star , including two of rape and six of indecent assault			1
commander @entity41 , head of @entity42 , said the allegations span four decades and information so far suggests abuse was on a ' national scale '			1
he said there are currently 120 lines of inquiry , although some could be duplicates			2
mr @entity41 told reporters : ' information is coming in as we speak probably			2
' the reality is this really has captured the public ’s mind			0
we are getting calls from victims , from witnesses and third parties who believe they know something about it			2
' we have formally recorded eight criminal allegations against @entity2			2
two of those are rape , six of indecent assault			1
a slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them ' these are primarily against girls in their mid-teens , so between 13 and 16 and it spans four decades of abuse			1
' he said the first dated back to about 1959 but most seemed to be in the 70s and 80s			0
@entity19 has been in contact with @entity82 and the @entity83 to gather information , and they are contacting alleged victims they have been talking to to see if they will co-operate , he said			1
' we believe there are probably another 20 potential victims there , ' mr @entity41 added			1
' it is too early for us to give you an accurate picture of what 120 lines of inquiry will distil down to but we believe we will come up with between 20 to 25 victims			1
' mr @entity41 said they are working to identify anyone who could be subject to criminal investigation			0
the @entity83 is not being investigated , he said			1
asked if allegations related to any institutions other than those mentioned in previous claims - the @entity83 , the @entity105 children 's home , or the school in @entity107 - he said he had contacted @entity108 , and @entity109			1
' the pattern of his offending behaviour does appear to be on a national scale , ' he said			0
mr @entity41 said police will produce a joint report with the @entity115 to look to see what lessons can be learned and what conclusions can be drawn , which can be shared with other agencies			2
calling it an ' assessment ' , rather than an investigation , he said it is being carried out by @entity19 and being led by its @entity122 , which looks at complex and history cases			1
there are seven officers working on the case , but that will go up to 10 tomorrow , ' because we are keen to draw this to a swift conclusion ' , he said			2
mr @entity41 said a provisional search of @entity19 's records could not find any record of any previous investigation into @entity136 , and they were only previously aware of the involvement of @entity139			1
although it is in its early stages , he said allegations suggested @entity145 's ' predilection for teenage girls '			1
as police seek to investigate the scandal , they are expected to speak to celebrities and former corporation staff in relation to the inquiry , the @entity147 reported			1
the @entity30 's family , from left , @entity154 ( nephew ) with partner @entity157 , @entity158 ( nephew ) and @entity160 ( niece ) with partner @entity162			1
his relatives have asked the gravestone be taken away the headstone will be removed by undertakers after his family said they wanted to respect public opinion ' there is a pattern of behaviour that is being presented to us which ultimately we will hope to analyse and present in a final report in some weeks time , ' he said			1
@entity174 , from the @entity115 , said over the last five days the charity has received 40 calls following the claims of abuse committed by @entity2			2
of these , 24 have been referred to police or other agencies that can support victims of abuse , he said , and 17 directly relate to @entity136			1
mr @entity174 said there were also 21 unrelated calls to the helpline that stemmed from publicity over the allegations			2
he said they consisted of ' people coming forward to report abuse as a result of the attention that has been drawn to this '			2
as the scandal deepens , undertakers were hoping to remove the star 's triple headstone – which they only put up on september 20 - last night subject to consents from @entity2 ’s relatives			1
the family said in a statement : ' members of the family of sir @entity2 have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in @entity207			1
' the family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery			0
' out of respect to public opinion , to those who are buried there , and to those who tend their graves and visit there , we have decided to remove it			0
' memory : @entity2 's coffin ' lay in state ' at the @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 after he died and thousands of fans arrived to pay tribute to the veteran entertainer , who has now been accused of sexual assault there had been concern about security at the cemetery following a vandal attack on a commemorative plaque to @entity136 outside his former home on @entity207 seafront			1
other mourners with loved ones buried in @entity245 were concerned despite regular security sweeps – now extended into the evening			0
one of the closest plots is the last resting place of soldier @entity249 whose sister @entity250 , from @entity228 , said : ' me and my brothers are all worried			0
' we are all very concerned because of the way things have turned out			0
no one knows what ’s going to happen			0
' there are always some nutters out there and we do n’t want any of it going our @entity249 ’s way			0
' @entity2 just happens to be buried next to two very brave soldiers – my brother and the man in the next grave which is also military			0

he was buried under the epitaph he dreamed up years ago – ' it was good while it lasted			0
' three 18ins thick slabs contain poetry , a potted biography of the star , and a list of charities he supported			0
the past two weeks have seen most of the star ’s connections with @entity207 severed			0
on sunday a footpath named after him – @entity145 ’s view – was dismantled following an attack on his nearby memorial plaque which was daubed with the words paedophile and rapist the previous week			0
plans for a statue were also scrapped			0
there is no suggestion at this stage that @entity2 's remains will be removed			0
his body was entombled in concrete last november to deter grave robbers in search of bling - although the coffin contains no valuables			0

@entity268 has added to the scandal by hinting that @entity2 could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse against young girls			1
the prime minister stopped short of revealing whether he felt the former @entity30 should lose the honour , but suggested that the case should be considered by a @entity328 committee which has the power to recommend forfeiture			2
his comments came after the chairman of the @entity333 gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation			0
@entity338 said the allegations against @entity2 could not be excused as behaviour from a time when ' attitudes were different '			0
the radio and tv presenter and charity fundraiser , who died in 2011 , has been accused by a growing number of women in the last few weeks of sexual abuse over a number of years			1
mr @entity268 told @entity352 ’s @entity351 programme today : ' these stories are deeply , deeply troubling and i hope that every organisation that has responsibilities will have a proper investigation into what happened , and if these things did happen , and how they were allowed to happen , and then of course everyone has to take their responsibilities			0
' asked if @entity145 should lose his knighthood , mr @entity268 said : ' we have something called a @entity365			0
it is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours , and obviously they have to do their job too			0
