they say the dead live on in our hearts and minds - but in one @entity3 province , the deceased continue to walk the earth in a rather more literal , zombie - like fashion			0
families in @entity11 in @entity12 dig up the bodies of their dead relatives before washing , grooming and dressing them in fancy new clothes			1
even dead children are exhumed - two of these photos show the skeleton of a baby wrapped in a print dress with a doll laid next to it			2
damaged coffins are fixed or replaced , and the mummies are then walked around the province by following a path of straight lines			2
the ritual is called @entity30 , or @entity31			1
according to the ancient @entity11 belief system , the spirit of a dead person must return to his village of origin			0
so if a person died on a journey , the family would go to the place of death and accompany the deceased back home by walking them back to the village			0
in the past , people were frightened to journey far , in case they died while they were away and were unable to return to their village			0
zombieland : the bodies resemble something out of a horror film as they are dug up every year to be washed and dressed up in new clothes in need of a comb : a man brushes the hair of a female corpse ( left ) and two mummified bodies stand rigidly next to each other , as if back to life ( right ) even the children : the skeleton of a dead baby has a floral dress laid on top of it , as a boy clutches a fluffy pink doll and stares worriedly down the camera lens what a drag : the dead bodies are dragged from where they died back to the village , always following a path of straight lines back together again : a couple stands reunited and dressed in brand new clothes ( left ) and a boy places a dead relative back into a coffin ( right ) a stonewall showing wooden effigies called tau - tau , which are created for members of the society with very high status			1

ritual is called @entity30 , or @entity31 , and takes place in @entity11 in @entity12
