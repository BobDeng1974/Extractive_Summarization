a tanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil that has been at the center of a dispute over @entity5 's oil billions vanished off the coast of @entity7 on thursday			1
the @entity9 tanker disappeared from @entity11 radar screens following a month of legal wrangling over whether it can offload its cargo in the @entity15 as the disintegration of @entity5 amid mounting violence continues , the semi-autonomous regime in @entity9 – in the north of @entity5 – is trying to cash in on @entity5 's oil reserves and export its own crude			1
oil tanker @entity22 ( also known as the @entity24 ) , which is carrying a cargo of @entity9 crude oil , approaching @entity27 , @entity7 on july 25			1
the boat has since disappeared from @entity11 radar a still image from video taken by a @entity15 @entity11 @entity33 aircraft shows the oil tanker @entity22 sitting in the @entity35 @entity5 @entity9 has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since may , energy experts told @entity39			1
but the increasingly weak regime in @entity41 is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the @entity9 regime can not sell the oil in the @entity15 the @entity11 's @entity47 ship - tracking system showed no position for the @entity24 on thursday , which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark			1
the tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea , off the coast of @entity7 , after leaving the @entity57 port of @entity58 in june and anchoring near the @entity15 port of @entity27 in late july			1
the @entity11 confirmed to @entity60 today that the last contact the agency had with the @entity22 was when the ship 's certificate of compliance was completed on july 27			0
the vessel 's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high - stakes dispute between @entity41 and the @entity9 over the right to export oil			2
several other tankers transporting disputed oil from @entity74 or @entity9 have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track			2
a @entity11 official told @entity60 today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the @entity35 , which it is not supposed to do			1
the official also said it was possible the ship had traveled outside the range of the @entity11 antennas which would account for it vanishing from the @entity47 ship - tracking system			0
legal dispute : the vessel 's disappearance is thought to be the latest development in a high stakes argument between @entity41 and the @entity9 over the right to export oil earlier this year , cutbacks in spending at the @entity11 have meant that longer - range antennas in the @entity35 have been gradually shutting down , the official said , making it harder to track ships that move further away from the shore			1
@entity11 also told @entity60 on friday that it had no plans to search areas of the @entity35 where the ship had been anchored			2
the tanker @entity104 , which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from @entity5 @entity9 turned off its satellite transponder on august 17 , north of @entity109 's @entity108			1
it reappeared unladen on august 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of @entity112 , ship tracking data on @entity115 showed last week			0
it was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was			0
a spokesman for the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) @entity122 would not comment on the tanker 's temporary disappearance at the time			0
@entity115 reported on july 31 that tanker @entity127 , which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of @entity9 oil , had been offloaded into another tanker in the @entity132			1
a senior executive at @entity134 confirmed in july that the ship - to - ship transfer involving the @entity127 took place in a ' legitimate operation '			0
the ship is ' fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations , ' said @entity141 , the chartering manager at @entity134 ' the ship is still in international waters , ' he added			0
the agency has a @entity33 aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the oil tanker @entity148 on july 25			0
only a few days ago , the partially - full @entity104 tanker carrying @entity9 crude oil , disappeared from satellite tracking north of @entity109 's @entity108			2
two days later , the empty vessel reappeared near @entity112			0
in late july , the tanker @entity127 offloaded part of its cargo of @entity9 crude oil onto another ship in the @entity132			2
the evasive behavior is the result of @entity41 wanting to block the @entity9 from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so			0
the @entity5 government in @entity41 has filed a lawsuit in a @entity15 court to reclaim control of the @entity24 cargo and block the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) from delivering its cargo			1
the suit demonstrates that @entity41 is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block @entity9 's oil deals , which they view as smuggling			1
however , the @entity9 see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence			0
on monday , the @entity15 court threw out the order saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast			1
but the judge invited @entity5 to re-plead its case over the cargo 's rightful ownership			0
the issue is expected to fuel tensions between @entity187 and @entity41 , as in theory , @entity5 can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil			0
a @entity11 official said the vessel in the @entity35 might have turned off its beacon , sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders , or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service			2
however , dozens of vessels were visible on thursday in the @entity200 , where the @entity9 tanker was last seen			0
the @entity24 's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high - stakes dispute between @entity41 and the @entity9 over the right to export oil			2
