by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 16:59 est , 30 january 2014 the head of the @entity3 has urged @entity5 officials to avoid appearances on @entity7 because the network posted a tweet saying that conservatives would be upset by a commercial featuring a biracial family			1
the commercial in question is an ad for @entity16 which will run during the @entity17 , and it will star the same biracial family that was used in one of the company 's previous ads. @entity7 posted a message to @entity24 late on wednesday night that read : ' maybe the rightwing will hate it , but everyone else will go awww : the adorable new # @entity16 ad w / biracial family ' and then added a link to their story with an embeded version of the ad			1
controversy : the @entity16 ad will air during the @entity17 and features a white mother , black father , and their daughter			1
the same cast of actors were featured in a previous ad for the company offensive : @entity7 deleted this tweet a short while after posting it late wednesday night they quickly took down the tweet and issued an apology saying that they ' deeply regret it ' and that ' it does not reflect the position of msnbc '			1
that was n't enough for @entity3 chair @entity54 , who said that he will no longer be appearing on the network after the tweet , which he said ' is one action in a pattern of noxious behavior '			1
he wrote that the message was just the latest in a ' petty and demeaning attacks on conservatives '			2
@entity54 has urged other @entity5 to avoid the network , where the shows usually lean left			1
his boycott caught the attention of network president @entity68 who released a statement announcing that they fired a staffer as a result			2
' the tweet last night was outrageous and unacceptable			0
we immediately acknowledged that it was offensive and wrong , apologized , and deleted it , ' @entity68 said in the statement			0
' we have dismissed the person responsible for the tweet			1
' i personally apologize to mr. @entity54 and to everyone offended			2
at @entity7 we believe in passionate , strong debate about the issues and we invite voices from all sides to participate			2
' apology : the network followed up with these tweets not enough : @entity54 is calling for a @entity3 boycott of the network until they get a public apology from @entity68 , @entity7 president this comes the same day as an interview with @entity68 was released on @entity96 wherein he defends @entity7 against calls of being too liberal - leaning in their coverage			1
' i think we ’ve never had an ideology			0
an ideology is a single thought across all programs			0
we ’ve never had that , ' he said			0
' obviously i hire people who fit the sensibility ... we do stay true to facts			0
you have to build your argument			0
that ’s why i call it a sensibility			0
' as an example , he said that @entity7 is not a safe haven of sorts for ' troubled ' @entity120 who may be looking for a cable news show to help rehabilitate their brand			2
that said , he said that the same could not be said for @entity3 rival @entity125			0
' i think they do have an ideology , because every @entity3 who ’s in trouble goes on that network to be taken care of ...			2
they ’re owned by @entity134 , which is @entity135			0
@entity136 runs it , and he comes out of the @entity5 , ' @entity68 said			0
@entity54 is n't the first @entity3 to question @entity7 's motives in recent weeks , as @entity140 governor @entity139 launched a tirade against the channel when they released a report alleging that he threatened to withhold @entity146 funds if a development deal did n't go through			1
' @entity7 is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to governor @entity139 and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him , even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three - minute attack ad against him this week , ' his team said in a statement .			1

@entity54 urges @entity5 to boycott @entity7 after their latest ' petty and demeaning attack on conservatives '
the @entity3 chair was upset about a tweet saying that conservatives would n't like an *upcoming* @entity17 ad for @entity16
called for @entity3 politicians to boycott the left - leaning channel
@entity7 removed the tweet , fired the person responsible and the president of the network issued an apology to @entity54
