imminent arrival : @entity1 of @entity2 , pictured with @entity3 they could have been any mother and child			0
the pony - tailed young woman sitting on a hay bale at a petting zoo with her little boy perched on her knee wore barely a trace of make - up			2
the only giveaway that she was someone special was the diamond and sapphire ring sparkling on her left hand			0
while some other mothers nudged one another in disbelief as @entity21 and @entity3 cooed over the new - born animals , staff at @entity24 , @entity25 , are so familiar with the @entity26 she knows many on first - name terms			1
helped by his mother , her prominent bump hidden beneath what appeared to be @entity33 ’s green @entity32 coat , @entity3 tenderly gave a bottle of milk to one of the farm ’s new - born piglets			1
if it seems to be a picture of a typical middle - class day out , that is no accident as this is exactly the informal , away - from - the - cameras upbringing @entity33 and @entity21 want for their children			1
that is why they are turning their new country bolt hole , @entity49 , on the @entity50 , into a secluded fortress home , far from prying eyes – and far removed from traditional @entity54 protocol			1
@entity55 is set to become their principal residence over the next few years as @entity33 focuses on family and his new flying career			1
for him , a life of peace and quiet is far preferable to his own pressure - cooker upbringing under the global spotlight			1
royal aides have confirmed that the @entity66 will head to @entity55 after the birth ( they will spend the first night at @entity68 ) – as will @entity21 ’s mother , @entity69 , to help with childcare and housekeeping			1
@entity21 will be taking a longer maternity leave this time round and @entity74 can reveal that the pilot @entity75 plans to scale back his black - tie charity commitments so that he can enjoy more time at home			1
‘ his focus for the next two years is on family and flying in that order , ’ a close friend revealed			2
already the couple have immersed themselves in a notably more domestic – not to say middle class – life style than many @entity87 , with under - the - radar shopping trips to nearby market towns and evening dinners in country pubs			1
a noticeable part of the mother - and - child day out at @entity24 was the absence of fuss and preferential treatment			2
the @entity99 ’s security detail , stationed a respectful 50 yards away , left @entity21 and @entity3 to enjoy their morning in peace			1
it was a sunny monday earlier this month , just days after the couple finally moved into @entity49			1
and @entity21 and @entity3 were enjoying one of their last days out together before the arrival of the new royal baby			1
she is absolutely lovely and @entity3 is delightful			0
there is never a fuss when she ’s here			0
‘ if she was n’t pointed out to you , you would n’t know she was here			0
she goes about her business like any other young mum and dotes on her child			0
@entity120 is lovely , extraordinarily social and other children seem to fuss over him			2
they have no idea who he is			0
’ according to a close friend of @entity21 ’s : ‘ she ca n’t wait to escape the hustle and bustle of the city			1
both she and @entity33 love the country and it ’s where they want to raise their family			2
’ it ’s not hard to see why they want to escape the confines of @entity136 , @entity68 , their official residence			2
fiercely private , the @entity66 are faced with the problem of being both public figures and private people			2
@entity33 has a complicated relationship with the media , dating back to his mother ’s tragic death			2
he despises the paparazzi and has threatened legal action against any individuals taking unofficial photographs of his family			0
@entity21 and young @entity3 have enjoyed meeting the new - born animals at @entity151 @entity3 and his mother are also regular visitors to the children ’s play area at a nearby village as a result , @entity3 is rarely photographed in public and has not made an official appearance in this country since leaving @entity162 ’s hospital 21 months ago			1
it is part of @entity33 ’s strategy to shelter his family and he has a team of qualified aides and lawyers to advise him on privacy laws			1
of course , @entity33 and @entity21 are also keen to enjoy the fruits of their two - year £ 1.5 million remodelling of their new home , with its ten bedrooms , swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds			1
their official residence will remain @entity68 , but @entity49 will be their de facto family home for at least the next two years as @entity33 embarks on a new career with the @entity183			1
as part of the costly renovations – which also included installing a new roof , a state - of - the - art kitchen and a conservatory – @entity33 had the driveway to the property , which used to belong to his close friends the @entity193 family , rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees			1
security is paramount and the outhouses have been converted into dwellings for the couple ’s security staff			2
at @entity49 , @entity3 can enjoy playing in the garden and @entity33 can cycle freely around the country lanes			1
@entity21 loves shopping in the locals villages of @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 and locals often see her playing with @entity3 at a play area in a nearby village			2
moving to @entity55 has afforded the couple the peace and freedom @entity33 especially has always craved			1
the tiny hamlet where they live is so small there is n’t even a pub , just a social club where the couple sometimes mingle with locals at its film nights			2
the residents of the blue - doored cottages , part of the @entity228 estate , are fiercely protective of their new neighbours			2
remember , too , that some of @entity33 ’s happiest childhood memories are of when his mother ripped up the stuffy @entity54 protocols and introduced her two young sons to ‘ normal ’ life by taking them to theme parks , go - kart tracks and public beaches – trips echoed by @entity21 and @entity3 ’s visit to the petting zoo			1
@entity1 of @entity2 enjoys shopping in picturesque @entity25 villages such as @entity208 ( pictured ) friends say they are considering sending @entity3 to a local nursery or playschool			0
while a royal aide says it is ‘ a bit premature ’ , the couple will soon have to think about the option for their son			2
the couple have already become central to the elite group of aristocratic locals known as the ‘ @entity256 ’			0
@entity3 ’s godfather @entity257 and his wife @entity258 live in @entity259 , 40 minutes away , while the @entity99 ’s old friends the @entity262 family live at @entity263 near @entity264			0
@entity33 ’s friend , @entity265 is often at the family seat , @entity268 in @entity269 , less than an hour from @entity49 , and the couple socialise with @entity273 ’s children @entity271 , @entity274 and @entity275 who @entity33 plays football with			1
the @entity99 ’s cousin @entity277 and her husband @entity278 also live in @entity279			0
the couple already have a list of favourite pubs			0
two weeks ago , they shared a dinner with six friends at @entity286 in nearby @entity287			0
@entity33 , seated at the head of the table next to his heavily pregnant wife , organised the supper to celebrate them finally moving to @entity55			1
‘ @entity33 and @entity21 have friends in @entity25 , and they enjoyed a private dinner in a dining room , ’ reports a source			1
‘ they wanted a night out and they can do it here			0
the locals are very protective of them , as are the pub owners			0
they organise special tables out of the way of prying eyes and escape routes so they are never seen coming in or leaving			0
’ the couple have been seen dining at the @entity308 in @entity309 , the @entity310 in @entity311 and the @entity312 at @entity24			0
while they are relaxed , their discreet security detail of five protection officers remains on high alert			0
friends say the plan is for @entity69 to move in to look after her daughter once @entity33 resumes work following a fortnight ’s paternity leave			2
the @entity99 , 32 , will be stationed at @entity323 when he is fully trained to fly a powerful @entity325 helicopter			0
he is said to be ‘ enormously excited ’ about flying again , but it will be a challenge juggling his new career with official duties			0
@entity33 will be based at @entity323 as part of his duties with the @entity183 the @entity66 have already enjoyed dinner with friends at one of their locals , the @entity335 at @entity287 the @entity74 has been told that @entity33 has implemented a number of changes to his diary and will be cutting back on black - tie charity events in particular			1
instead , a friend insisted , he plans to continue with the informal , more intimate charity work he loves			0
a spokesman for the @entity99 said he remains committed to his charities , adding : ‘ the @entity99 ’s intent is to work as full time as possible			0
he starts flying in the summer and his roster will take into account his official engagements			0
these will be broadly consistent with previous years			0
’ meanwhile , his family will be staying in the background			0
princes @entity33 and @entity351 were filmed as toddlers playing the piano in the @entity68 nursery with their parents , but @entity33 and @entity21 have refused to allow the cameras into their home			1
pointedly , @entity3 fulfilled his only official engagement on the other side of the world in @entity361 during the couple ’s tour of @entity364 and @entity365			0
that short yet charming photocall has been his sole appearance in the public eye			0
@entity369 strove to create as ordinary a life as possible for her boys and @entity33 wants the same for his own children			1
he has seen the charm , security and joys of a happy family life with the @entity377 and it is what he desires for his own family			0
both he and @entity21 realise such a dream is far more realistic far from the madding crowds at @entity49 .			1

@entity33 and @entity21 are turning @entity49 into a secluded fortress home
couple want informal , away - from - the - cameras upbringing for their children
@entity55 is set to become their principal residence over the next few years
royal aides confirmed the @entity66 will head to @entity55 after the birth
