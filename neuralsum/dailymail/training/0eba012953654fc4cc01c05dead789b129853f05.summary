by @entity0 when his kidneys began to fail at the age of 25 , @entity1 faced a lifetime hooked up to a dialysis machine			2
he was put on to the transplant list but warned he would have to undergo dialysis for six months before he was deemed eligible for a new organ			2
in those six months if he received no treatment at all @entity10 , r @entity1 was warned his renal failure would claim his life			1
determined not to watch their son deteriorate in front of their eyes , the now 42 - year - old 's parents @entity13 and @entity14 , stepped in			1
@entity1 ( bottom left ) is believed to be among a handful of people in the world to have received three kidney transplants from his mother @entity14 ( bottom right ) , father @entity13 ( top right ) and sister @entity25 ( top left ) they put themselves forward to be tested to see if they were a match - and remarkably , both parents were told they could save their son			1
it was mrs @entity35 , 63 , who insisted on joining her son in the operating theatre , donating her kidney , in what appeared to be a successful transplant operation			2
but after more than 50 hospital visits in the next eight years , the organ began to fail			0
in 2006 mr @entity1 returned to the @entity43 for transplant number two			1
this time it was his father , @entity13 , 67 , who stepped in to help , donating one of his kidneys			2
again the success of the transplant operation was short - lived , when last year - seven years after receiving his father 's kidney - mr @entity1 faced another failing organ			1
he was forced to go back on dialysis and appeared to be running out of options when his sister @entity25 , 33 , said she wanted to help			1
the nursery manager underwent the relevant tests , which revealed she was a 100 per cent match			2
two weeks ago the siblings were admitted to the @entity61 where surgeons carried out mr @entity1 's third transplant			1
the father - of - one today said he feels ' rejuvenated ' and is looking forward to getting his life back on track after years of uncertainty and treatment			1
mr @entity1 , whose son @entity69 is 15 , said : ' in the space of two weeks i had gone from being on top of the world to being told i may only have six months to live			1
the 42 - year - old 's first operation took place at the @entity43 in 1998 when he was 25 years old			1
eight years later he had the second procedure , when father @entity13 donated one of his kidneys ' without a matching donor i faced life on dialysis			1
but i was extremely fortunate because mum and dad had tests and were both matches for me			0
' you have to take a lot of drugs to stop your body rejecting the kidney but they suppress your immune system , which leaves you at risk of infection			0
' it is a fine balancing act , and i was just unlucky			0
the air smells cleaner and food tastes good again			0
' i have a real feeling of rejuvenation and it feels like i 've been given four lives			0
' @entity102 , dad and @entity25 have all put their own lives at risk to make my life more comfortable and i will be forever grateful for that			2
' @entity102 , dad and @entity25 have all put their own lives at risk to make my life more comfortable and i will be forever grateful for that ' - transplant patient @entity1 ' they can see that i am not taking it for granted by keeping myself fit and active			1
some people can be dialysis for 10 or 20 years and never get a donor			0
' some eventually get one from a stranger , which is great for them but the added benefit i have is that i can thank my mum , dad and @entity25 every day			2
' after his first transplant , mr @entity1 took up a voluntary committee management role for @entity126			1
he won two silver medals at the @entity128 in @entity129 where he was captain of the @entity131 's tennis team			0
he has also won medals at the @entity128 in @entity133 in 2007 , @entity129 2009 and @entity134 2011			0
mr @entity1 said : ' the games are a way for people like me to show everyone that since having a transplant , we have not just sat at home and rested on our laurels			1
' it shows that we want to make the most of what we 've been given			0
two weeks ago mr @entity1 and his sister @entity25 ( pictured ) underwent his third transplant			1
he said he feels ' rejuvenated ' , and thanked his family for stepping in when he needed their help ' my son @entity69 was born a year after my first transplant so he 's grown up knowing that i need a lot of treatment			1
' he 's still in school but he 's a bright lad and just like the rest of my family he 's very supportive			2
' people i 've met have said it 's quite uncommon for people to have that many transplants at all , let alone all from their own family			0
' the odds would have been incredible			0
' everyone we spoke to at the hospital said it was very rare to have three kidneys donated all from family members			0
' it really does feel like i 've had a new lease of life again , not for the first time , so i 'm massively grateful to my family and all of the medical staff who have helped me			0
' @entity177 , a consultant transplant surgeon at the hospital , said : ' we have seen many cases where a person has two or even three transplants			0
' but @entity183 is the first we have treated who has been fortunate enough to find three matches in his own family			0
' it is wonderful they were able to help him in this way			0
