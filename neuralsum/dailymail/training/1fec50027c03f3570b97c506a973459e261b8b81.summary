@entity0 is on the verge of being able to send out his dream starting @entity3 for @entity4 , after putting an almost completely fit side through training on friday morning			1
and , with the @entity4 manager insisting results prove his team is currently the best in the @entity11 , that spells trouble for sides hoping to pip the @entity14 to a @entity16 spot			1
@entity4 have lost just one of their last 19 games in all competitions , reaching the quarter - finals of the @entity21 and drastically improving their chances of a top - four finish			1
@entity25 and @entity26 sprint during training as @entity0 had the opportunity to pick from an almost completely fit squad @entity30 ( second left ) returned to the squad after missing @entity4 's unconvincing @entity21 win against @entity32 last week @entity33 says @entity4 are the best team in the @entity11 on current form after a run that has seen them lose once since early november @entity36 ( right ) and @entity37 ( centre ) laugh as they run alongside @entity39 with @entity26 watching on @entity40 holds his arms aloft during friday 's training session as @entity4 prepared to exact revenge for their defeat to @entity45 at @entity46 on saturday they visit @entity45 - who ruined @entity0 's debut as @entity4 manager by winning 2 - 1 at @entity46 on the opening day of the season			1
but with @entity0 denied just one injured first team star at the @entity54 tomorrow , the @entity52 knows he is on the brink of having a full - strength squad for the closing stages of the campaign			1
@entity33 said : ' we are very close to that stage			0
in the first four months i started only to select from out of the fit players			0
' and , as you know , i always had 10 or 11 players injured			0
' now , the last month , i only have one or two players and now only @entity66 is injured so that 's a big difference			2
' that 's also because of the way of training , also the players had to adapt to the way of training , and now that 's complete			0
that 's the big difference with the beginning of the season			2
' @entity26 watches his strike partner @entity40 go for a sprint , as the pair prepare for the possibility of playing together up front again @entity26 and @entity25 looked focused but relaxed as they trained ahead of the trip to @entity45 on friday morning @entity86 walks out to train alongside @entity88 goalkeeper @entity87 , who appears to be feeling the cold in @entity90 @entity91 looks through the net as he continues to wait for his first taste of first team football since joining from @entity95 @entity4 , with their stars now fit , have lost just once in the last 19 games in all competitions , and are sitting third in the league with the likes of @entity26 and @entity39 fit , @entity33 has competition for places in forward positions with his star - studded squad midfielder @entity66 is the only member of the @entity4 squad who is currently unavailable for @entity33 to select against @entity45 it is a far cry from the opening day of the season , when @entity4 lost 2 - 1 to @entity45 at @entity46 @entity33 ca n't watch as @entity4 lost in his first game in charge , but insists the side are better now , with their spirit and quality shining through @entity4 's team look on in disbelief during that august defeat , but they have since become a tough team to beat in the @entity11 @entity33 has had his critics in his first season in charge of the club but has nevertheless presided over a remarkable upturn in fortunes			1
and he believes that his first team players have now got over the difficulties of transitioning to a new management style and have bought into his footballing philosophy			2
@entity33 said : ' now i believe every player knows the philosophy of me and my staff			0
' you can see that in the team spirit of the team , it 's unbelievable			0
the likes of @entity25 and @entity39 have arrived at @entity46 since the opening day defeat and @entity4 's squad is now packed with quality @entity33 insists the players have now taken on his philosophy , and are playing with confidence in their climb up the league ' the confidence is the same now as then because we had just come back from the @entity148 where we had won everything against big clubs			1
' but now , when you look at the scores of the last 15 or 20 matches , we are the best team in the @entity11 so i think the confidence is also high			0
' the difference with the beginning of the season is my players know and have experienced much more playing in our system with our philosophy			0
' @entity33 has to decide whether to recall @entity30 for the trip to @entity45 at the expense of @entity39 although he has the option of using @entity86 up front .			2

@entity4 have lost just one of their last 19 games
