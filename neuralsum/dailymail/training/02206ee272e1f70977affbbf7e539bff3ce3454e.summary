by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:51 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 20:15 est , 25 november 2013 @entity2 was accused of performing a hasty u-turn last night after agreeing to cap sky - high rates charged by @entity5 and other payday lenders			1
the chancellor rushed out plans for a ceiling on the cost of payday loans , which are expected to limit the maximum price of a loan to as little as 10 per cent of its value			1
but senior @entity16 accused him of having resisted a tougher crackdown for months , and claimed he decided to act only after realising he faced a likely defeat on the issue in @entity20			1
crackdown : chancellor @entity2 said he wanted to end the ' legal extortion ' of high interest rates imposed by payday lenders mr @entity2 insisted there was growing evidence in support of the move , including the positive effects of a cap brought into force in @entity31			1
‘ we ’ve always believed in properly regulated free markets where there is competition but consumers are protected , ’ he said			2
he denied charges of a u-turn , pointing out that @entity39 had done ‘ absolutely nothing ’ to tackle payday lenders during their 13 years in office			1
rising @entity39 star @entity43 has led a long campaign for a legal limit on the amounts charged by payday lenders , which critics say can ramp up to as high as 5,853 per cent a year if supposedly short - term loans are allowed to roll on			1
pressure on the government to intervene grew earlier this year when the archbishop of canterbury @entity51 issued a fierce denunciation of the burgeoning industry			1
@entity16 leader @entity55 , business secretary @entity56 and consumer minister @entity57 have been urging the @entity58 to take a stronger stance ‘ for quite a long while ’ , according to a senior @entity16 source			2
@entity39 mp @entity43 , who has led the successful campaign for a cap on sky - high charges by payday lenders , has carved out a higher profile for herself than most of the members of @entity70 ’s shadow @entity71			1
to the irritation of some of her longer - serving colleagues , the 36 - year - old @entity77 mp , who entered @entity20 in 2010 , is increasingly tipped as a potential future party leader			1
some senior @entity79 refer to her sarcastically as ‘ @entity81 ’ , while others in the shadow @entity71 mutter that she is not enough of a ‘ team player ’ ever to succeed as party leader			2
as well as confronting payday lenders with a relentless zeal , @entity89 , who has a phd , has also campaigned on the issue of @entity94 abuse directed at women – reporting ‘ trolls ’ to the police			2
one male @entity94 user who called her a ‘ dumb , blonde bitch ’ received the response : ‘ that ’s dumb dr blonde bitch to you , actually			2
’ miss @entity89 ’s youthful appearance is once said to have prompted @entity109 minister @entity108 to wonder what she was doing in a lift reserved for mps , apparently because he assumed she was someone ’s personal assistant			2
a keen indie music fan , miss @entity89 once told applicants for a job as her parliamentary assistant that ‘ knowledge of mid and late 90s indie music is beneficial ’			2
‘ it has previously been blocked by the @entity109 , specifically the @entity58 , ’ the source said			2
‘ it has never been total opposition but there has been a real reluctance to look at mandating a cap			1
’ but @entity109 sources said claims of resistance from mr @entity2 were ‘ totally untrue ’ and that @entity130 @entity129 had been making the ‘ moral case ’ for intervention for months			1
the @entity16 source claimed the chancellor had caved in after being warned that the government risked defeat in a vote due to be called in the @entity138 to amend the law to cap the cost of payday loans			1
@entity16 peer lord @entity142 proposed a maximum loan of £ 300 , a cap on charges of a maximum of 10 per cent of the loan value and a bar on people from having two or more loans at the same time			1
the government has already given the new @entity152 the power to cap fees and rates on payday loans , but the @entity58 is now to go further by placing an obligation on the regulator to use those powers			1
labour leader @entity70 used a speech earlier this month to accuse payday of targetting vulnerable people who are threatened and bullied when they get into financial trouble the rules are to be included in the @entity165 , which is proceeding through @entity20			1
‘ the regulator will go away and decide what is the best form of cap , ’ the chancellor said			1
lord @entity142 said he was ‘ delighted ’ by the move			0
‘ for far too long unscrupulous payday loan companies have been allowed to prey on some of the most vulnerable people in our society with impunity , ’ he added			1
‘ far from leading to a reduction in access to credit , as the payday lenders are claiming this morning , evidence has shown that the volume of money lent to people actually increased after a regulatory system was put in place			1
‘ people need protection from the worst excesses of the payday loan companies , and i am glad that the @entity58 has seen the light			1
’ by @entity1 @entity5 typical apr 5853 % signed a four - year deal to sponsor @entity191			0
this month hired a @entity193 - nominated director to produce a film on the controversial company to counteract criticism about its huge profits and sky - high interest rates			1
cash lady typical apr 2670 % courted controversy when it hired ex-bankrupt reality star @entity202 to front ad campaign			0
but this summer the @entity205 star declared herself bankrupt for the second time in five years due to unpaid debts			0
her money troubles led to her being dropped as the face of @entity209			0
@entity211 @entity210 typical apr 2610 % bought by @entity213 giant @entity212 in 2011 for a reported $ 195million			0
it is now part of the same firm which owns @entity217 , which has 550 stores nationwide			0
@entity219 typical apr 1734 % spent an estimated £ 3.2 million , advertising during programmes like friends , @entity223 and @entity224			0
in july it apologised after sending emails threatening to send in debt collectors to people who had not borrowed money			1
allowing people to borrow a small amount of money for a short period of time is a legitimate and useful business			1
but those who turn to payday loan firms are sometimes desperate and often disadvantaged			0
what they need is protection			0
what they have is the @entity243 , with companies behaving as they please and charging what they like			0
charities are being swamped by calls from households who thought they would have to repay only a small amount after a few days , but have ended up with crippling debts			0
now , the government is planning to cap the cost of payday loans			1
currently all companies that offer payday loans are supposed to state their annual percentage rate ( @entity259 )			0
for example , @entity5 ’s apr is 5,835 per cent			0
this is for someone who borrowed £ 150 for 18 days			0
they ’d repay a total of £ 183.49 including interest and charges			1
details of the government ’s plan have not been revealed			2
@entity31 already has a cap			2
there the maximum a lender can charge is a set - up fee equivalent to 20 per cent of the loan , plus 4 per cent a month			0
this provides for maximum charges of $ 72 ( £ 40 ) for a $ 300 ( £ 170 ) borrowing over one month			2
but this is still an apr of 1,221 per cent			0
though high , it ’s far cheaper than most in the @entity210			0
a similar rule here will do little , however , to stop the perilous rolling over of debt and charges from one month to the next			2
and capping aprs for payday lenders will do nothing to curb the high cost of short - term borrowing from banks			0
an investigation by the @entity293 earlier this year found that the equivalent apr for an overdraft with some of @entity210 ’s biggest banks was as high as 53million per cent when borrowing £ 200 for ten days			0
yet , banks are not forced to use apr for the cost of an overdraft			0
one solution may be to scrap the apr altogether – it is a complicated calculation not widely understood			0
that would mean finding an alternative method of comparing total costs for loans taken over different lengths of time			0
an apr at least allows an indication of how expensive one type of loan is compared to another			0
perhaps the best solution , and that championed by @entity16 peer lord @entity142 , would be to cap the total size of a payday loan at £ 300 and cap charges at 10 per cent of the amount borrowed			1
it ’s a calculation that most borrowers could easily understand			0
add in other charges and ban the fees on debts that are rolled over , and the total amount to repay would be £ 333			1
that ’s three times cheaper than a similar loan at present in the @entity210			0
in @entity326 , an identical set of rules has been in place for more than a decade and payday firms there still make a very healthy profit indeed			0
whatever the government ’s rules , the effect must be to slash the cost of short - term borrowing , because every penny that does n’t make it into the pockets of payday lenders is cash that helps the desperate and indebted .			2

@entity341 will cover interest rates , fees , *penalties* and *rollover* charges
