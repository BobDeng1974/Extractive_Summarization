after @entity2 ’s sensational upset of his former club , you could have forgiven @entity5 for trying to swap shirts with one of his illustrious opponents			1
@entity10 , maybe , or @entity11 ? no chance			2
the 26 - year - old midfielder , deemed surplus to requirements at the @entity16 in 2010 after 12 years at @entity17 , had no interest in giving anyone his own memento of the big day			1
‘ i did n’t get a shirt , ’ he explained after @entity21 and @entity22 clinched a stunning victory for the well - drilled championship promotion chasers			1
@entity5 said the only memento he wanted from the win at the @entity16 was his own shirt ‘ i ’m keeping my own after beating @entity17 on their own turf			1
’ for many on @entity34 this fully deserved victory was sweet			2
@entity21 , on loan from @entity17 ’s title rivals @entity37 , will have relished the opportunity to show he can succeed on the big stage while goalkeeper @entity40 , who denied the home side from racing clear in the first half , had a point to prove after a shaky start to his career with the club			1
but for @entity5 , who grew up 10 minutes away from @entity17 ’s old @entity49 stomping ground , it meant more than most			1
he was sent packing without making a first - team appearance as cash from @entity52 — and a host of star names — rolled in			2
‘ i was on the bench here a couple of times under @entity57 , ’ he explained			0
‘ that was good considering the calibre of players they were bringing in			0
to come back here and win is a nice victory for us			0
’ @entity2 striker @entity21 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity17 @entity67 ( second right ) celebrates with his team - mates after scoring at @entity16 in the @entity71 fourth round @entity5 , whose grandfather has been a @entity17 fan for 60 years , admitted his family was divided over the tie but added that he had made his father ’s afternoon			1
‘ my mum ’s side are @entity17 fans , ’ he said			2
‘ my dad ’s a @entity80 fan , though , so i ’m sure he ’ll have enjoyed the day			0
’ a former ballboy at the @entity16 , @entity5 said that only @entity82 remained from his time at the club and that the @entity86 keeper , who was benched for the match , had congratulated him at the end			1
‘ i spoke to @entity82 and a few of the staff i know and they just said “ well done ” — and to be fair i think we did play quite well			0
‘ it was nice to get a little pat on the back and to see the place again			0
’ much had been made of @entity17 ’s late arrival from their five - day mid-season jaunt to the desert homeland of their owners			1
some claimed that landing back in @entity104 on friday evening , hours before the fourth - round tie , illustrated a lack of respect for their opponents			2
@entity5 , whose path to @entity2 included stops in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , was having none of that			1
‘ they are used to travelling around the world , @entity118 games , tours , all that stuff so i do n’t think that will have affected them too much , ’ he said			0
substitute @entity22 celebrates after scoring in added time to seal his side 's place in the next round @entity17 players @entity131 ( left ) , @entity127 ( centre ) and @entity129 look dejected after their side concede ‘ you could argue it ’s not the best preparation , but i ’m sure they did everything they could to make them comfortable			1
’ despite his elation , and his boss @entity141 ’s close relationship with @entity144 ’s title rival @entity143 , @entity5 insisted he still wanted @entity17 to go on and pip the @entity146 club to the @entity148 title			1
‘ i hope they go on to win it , although i ca n’t say that as @entity141 likes @entity143 ! ’ he joked			0
‘ i do n’t mind			0
but we ’re in the next round so that ’s what matters			2
’ a beaming @entity141 had his family at the post-match press conference as he reflected on his finest moment in 14 months of management			0
he had spent the afternoon frustrating opposite number @entity144 — and that continued after the match when the @entity161 had to wait for him to finish before facing the media himself			0
it was one of those days .			0

@entity2 beat @entity17 2 - 0 in the @entity71 fourth round
@entity21 and @entity22 scored the goals at the @entity16
@entity5 said he had no interest in swapping shirts after the game
