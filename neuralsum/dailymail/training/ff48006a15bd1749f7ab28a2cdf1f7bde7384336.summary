three weeks from now they are supposed to be the dream team that will lead @entity2 to victory at the @entity4			1
but @entity5 and @entity6 did n’t cover themselves in glory yesterday when they withdrew before the start of the third round of the @entity12			2
twenty - four hours after declaring the @entity14 course an ‘ extremely fun place to play ’ , @entity5 evidently decided he was n’t having any fun at all after a second - round 76 left him well off the pace			1
players are not supposed to withdraw without good reason and the 44 - year - old star attraction will surely be fined			0
‘ my primary goal is to rest and prepare for the @entity4 , ’ he said in a prepared statement			1
after all those years of @entity39 and @entity5 , this was the season their era came to an end , with neither winning on tour for the first time since 1992			2
for those who remained , revitalised @entity46 @entity45 headed into the third round with a one - stroke lead over @entity2 @entity50 , with @entity36 , his nemesis this summer , a further shot adrift			0
decisions : @entity5 discusses his next course of action with caddie @entity55 meanwhile , @entity56 will drive away from @entity57 tonight in a new @entity12 after a hole in one at the @entity59			0
the @entity60 , who is having such a dreadful year that he can not afford to run a car , holed out with a six iron on the 11th at @entity63 on his way to a third - round 64 and a one - shot lead over @entity66 .			0

@entity5 will miss the @entity69 play - offs finale for the first time in his career
a six - over - par 76 left @entity5 *seventh* last in the *68* - *man* field
he said : ' my primary goal is to rest and prepare for the @entity4 '
2014 *edition* takes place at @entity81 from *september* *26* - *28*
