she 's rockstar royalty who grew up around @entity3 , modelled for @entity4 and counts @entity5 and @entity6 as her best friends - is @entity9 's coolest young model ? it would seem so			1
@entity11 - a popular @entity12 clothing brand - wanted to tap into the magic so snapped the 25 - year - old up to front its latest campaign - and she could n't be happier about it			1
' it 's my perfect aesthetic , ' she told @entity18 of her new campaign			2
' the clothes are comfortable and cool and exactly what i wear myself			2
i am @entity22 born and bred so i am hoping to bring that edge to the campaign			2
exuding an edgy but relaxed vibe , @entity27 says the whole campaign is an accurate reflection of her own style , which was shaped by trips to @entity44 market with her mother			1
' my mum would always take me to the market and buy these lace dresses and @entity50			1
i felt like a @entity52 witch at the time but it 's actually shaped my style and i really love my mother 's dress sense , it 's amazing , ' she said			1
one person she does n't take style advice from is best friend and fellow model and muse , @entity62			1
' we 're best friends , we do n't sit around giving each other style advice			1
she does obviously have amazing style and always look brilliant though , ' she adds			1
@entity27 and @entity62 are part of what 's been dubbed ' the new @entity69 ' , along with @entity70 , @entity6 , @entity71 and @entity5			2
they frequent the capital 's hottest parties , set the trends and have a good time doing it - but you wo n't catch @entity27 taking it for granted			2
she relishes every opportunity and still gets starstruck despite her starry roster of pals			0
@entity27 , who cites walking in @entity82 's show as her ultimate career coup , said : ' meeting @entity84 was pretty unreal			0
i could n't believe my luck at wearing his clothes			0
he said to me " you look amazing and you smell amazing " , it was unreal , ' she gushed			0
perfect fit : @entity27 said the campaign is her perfect aesthetic and thinks the clothes are comfortable and cool and exactly what she loves to wear herself lading lady : @entity27 attends the @entity11 vip store launch at @entity22 last night as she reveals her mother shaped her style by taking her shopping at local markets despite being one of @entity9 's most famous clothes horses , @entity27 does n't starve herself and recently penned a cookbook , @entity106 and @entity107 , full of healthy recipes			1
speaking about her diet , she said : ' i like to do everything in moderation but i 'm certainly no angel ! the horrible food guilt feeling is the reason i wrote my book , it 's the worst ! ' when i eat wheat and sugar , i can actually feel it and it feels like i 've been badly behaved			0
if i eat chocolate , i notice a spot from it a few days later			0
' instead , she created recipes such as goji berry chocolates , which are a big hit with her pals who raid her fridge for her healthy treats when they come over			0
' i wanted to share self - loving recipes with the world			0
as a society , we are so self - depricating and i wanted to find a way we could feel good , ' she added			0
staying trim : @entity27 says she is no angel but credits healthy treats , swimming and meditation for her balanced lifestyle she also credits working out four times a week , swimming classes and pilates as the secrets behind her healthy figure			1
meditation , which has become a favourite amongst celebrities in recent months , is also key to her lifestyle			1
' my godmother got me into it			0
after she started doing it , i noticed a stillness behind her eyes , a quiet calmness that i wanted			0
' it took @entity27 four months to master the art but now she meditates twice a day - on trains , in hair and makeup and in taxis - and says it helps the flow of her day			0
so what 's next for the in - demand young star ? ' i have plans but i 'm keeping them to myself , ' she said			2
