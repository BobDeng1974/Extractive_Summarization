@entity50 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity54			2
@entity57 career with 141 in @entity58 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity14 age 33 caps 64 verdict if @entity5 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity14 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity6 will stay with @entity0			1

a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity73 age 24 caps 1 verdict played his only test to date at @entity77 in 2013 , where he got up @entity5 ’s noses by accusing them of boring batting			1
a left - arm seam - bowling all - rounder , he can give the ball an almighty whack			2
@entity87 age 24 caps 13 verdict injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011 - 12 , but the talent is undeniable : tall , aggressive and fast , he should trouble @entity5 more than his brother , @entity94 , when playing for @entity5 in a single test against @entity96 in 2008			1
@entity97 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity6 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			2
@entity103 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			2
@entity104 ( wkt ) age 37 caps 63 verdict @entity0 ’s second-most important cog in their 5 - 0 @entity6 wheel in 2013 - 14 , after @entity14			1
his sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team			0

calm , compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner @entity31			0
@entity121 ( vice captain ) age 25 caps 26 verdict one of world cricket ’s rising stars , he scored four tons in @entity0 ’s recent home series against @entity127			1
will captain the side full - time after @entity21 retires , and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg - spin			2
@entity131 age 27 caps 39 verdict a steady off - spinner who troubled @entity5 ’s right - handers during whitewash			1
but , really , they should have nothing to fear			0
@entity12 age 25 caps 15 verdict another left - arm seamer , and @entity141 at the @entity2			1
his yorkers are as dangerous in @entity143 as they are in @entity144 , and accuracy and pace have improved			0
@entity147 age 35 caps 27 verdict if he can drag his injury - laden body through one final series , @entity0 will be thrilled			1
he was an unsung star during their 3 - 0 defeat here two years ago , and produced the ball of the series to bowl @entity7 in @entity156			0
@entity66 age 24 caps 3 verdict one of a batch of promising @entity19 fast bowlers , he proved economical beyond his years during the successful @entity2 campaign			1
a flawless action bodes well			0
@entity163 age 33 caps 20 verdict the @entity166 - born leg - spinner has played only three one - day internationals and two @entity170 games for @entity0 , so would represent a risk			1
but @entity19 leggies have done well in @entity5 before … @entity21 ( capt ) age 33 caps 108 verdict age has not diminished his class , as he proved in the @entity2 final			1
but his dodgy back could be an issue in a five - test series			0
should out - captain @entity7 once more			0
@entity31 age 28 caps 36 verdict could win a test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions			0
@entity39 ’s off - breaks will be crucial in pinning him down			0

@entity41 age 33 caps 56 verdict has a decent record in @entity6 cricket , but has never reached the stage where he frightens @entity5			2
but his medium - pace balances @entity0 ’s team in a way @entity7 can only envy			1
@entity50 age 31 caps 12 verdict a gritty left - hander , and son of former test opener @entity54			0
@entity57 career with 141 in @entity58 in 2011 , but success has been sporadic since then			0
@entity14 age 33 caps 64 verdict : if @entity5 have n’t got over the trauma of the 2013 - 14 series , when @entity14 took 37 wickets at 13 apiece , the @entity6 will stay with @entity0			1
@entity97 age 30 caps 56 verdict the banana - loving seamer is a veteran of two @entity6 tours , and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him			2
@entity103 , for one , found him almost impossible to score off in 2013 - 14			0
@entity213 age 23 caps 4 verdict a rangy all - rounder and younger brother of @entity50 , @entity50 stunned @entity5 during the @entity2 with figures of 5 for 33 at @entity219 – despite having taken only six odi wickets until then			1
his batting is the stronger suit			0
@entity223 age 29 caps 0 @entity225 who ? @entity223 has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his @entity229 team - mate @entity104 , although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team			0
unlikely to get a game unless @entity104 breaks a finger			0
@entity234 age 35 caps 0 verdict an outsider for a test debut , but he knows @entity240 conditions well – @entity234 has spent time with @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 – and bowls left - arm spin to complement his middle - order hitting .			0
