with his long floppy ears and apparently docile demeanour , @entity1 the rabbit is hardly as threatening as a guard dog			1
but for one family , he has certainly proved just as effective			2
@entity6 told yesterday how her huge pet rabbit scared off a burglar – by thumping his massive feet on the floor			1
protector : @entity6 may and her three - year - old daughter @entity12 with giant bunny @entity1 after he scared off a burglar by thumping loudly she and her fiance @entity15 had only had two - year - old @entity1 for a couple of weeks when an intruder broke into their home in @entity20			1
but his owners believe the raider was scared off thanks to the @entity25 giant rabbit stomping his feet in his cage			1
miss may , a hospital staff nurse , said she was half woken in the early hours by @entity1 making ‘ five loud thumps ’ but she went back to sleep			1
in the morning , @entity15 went downstairs and found a @entity33 medal , a laptop and @entity35 were missing – but a lot of other valuables had been left behind			0
miss may said : ‘ we went to bed on wednesday at about 10pm			0
in the early hours of the morning @entity1 our rabbit did five loud thumps			1
i sort of half woke up then realised he ’d stopped and went back to sleep			0
‘ when i went downstairs , every single cupboard and drawer was open , there were bits out everywhere			0
then we started noticing that things were missing and we phoned the police			0
‘ they managed to take a laptop , an @entity35 and my handbag with my purse and everything in , but the worst thing was my great - granddad ’s medal			2
’ intruder : the thief broke into the family home in @entity20 without realising it was under the protection of a monster bunny raising the alarm : the 4.5kg , 2ft - long pet began stomping so loudly on the floor that the intruder fled the medal was a @entity69 ’s @entity68 medal belonging to @entity70			1
it is silver and inscribed with his name and regiment			0
miss may added : ‘ my gran died in 2007 , she lived in a council house all her life and hardly had any possessions			0
that was the one important thing she had			0
’ miss may said she found a hoard of items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was preparing to take but left behind			1
‘ we think that when the rabbit thumped it scared off the burglars and they left all the stuff they were going to take , ’ she added			2
the couple , who have a three - year - old daughter , @entity12 , are due to get married in nearby @entity92 on august 30			2
miss may said : ‘ they also took a box which had all our wedding invitations and favours in it as well as paperwork which i was due to give to the church and reception venue			0
reward : @entity1 's delighted owner has bought him a new tunnel to play with as a thank you present hero : when miss may came downstairs she found a hoard of items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was preparing to take but left behind ‘ i ’ve had to go to the library to get proof that i used to live in @entity92 so i can get married at the church – they just do n’t think about the impact it has to take things like that			1
’ after the break - in , @entity1 was left ‘ traumatised ’ and even tried to attack the policeman who came to investigate			1
the 4.5kg rabbit is nearly 2ft long and 10in tall , and he could yet grow more – @entity25 @entity123 rabbits can reach up to 5.9kg			1
@entity1 is so big he lives in a cage built for a labrador			1
the family got their prized pet from an animal adoption centre which had taken him in			0
miss may said : ‘ he ’s playful , really friendly , and he does n’t mind my three - year - old crawling all over him			2
he ’s like a small dog really			0
‘ when he thumps on the floor it ’s incredibly loud – you can hear it echoing around the house			0
’ police are appealing for information about the break - in , which happened a week ago			2
@entity142 @entity141 said : ‘ they had the rabbit in the kitchen and mentioned that he was making a noise in the night			0
but there was nothing to say the burglar was definitely scared off			2
