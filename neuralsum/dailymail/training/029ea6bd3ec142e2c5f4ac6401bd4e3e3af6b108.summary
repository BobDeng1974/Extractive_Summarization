by @entity0 one in four people who have had cosmetic procedures on the @entity4 have lied to secure funding , new research suggests			1
a quarter of patients have lied about their mental health to get treatment as they did not meet the standard criteria			1
many of these people have claimed to have low self - esteem or depression as a result of their appearance , according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors			1
one in four people who have plastic surgery on the @entity4 lie about their mental health to meet criteria , according to new research the firm surveyed 1,394 over- 18s in the @entity23 who said they had had cosmetic surgery on the @entity4 within the last five years			1
the most common procedure these people had had was breast enlargement – 24 per cent had been given breast implants			0
the next most common procedure was mole removal ( 18 per cent ) , followed by breast reduction ( 11 per cent ) , a nose job ( seven per cent ) and ear reshaping five per cent )			0
@entity35 also discovered that 24 per cent of the patients had not initially met the criteria required to receive the treatment on the @entity4			1
these people admitted to lying to get it			0
they were then asked what they had been dishonest about			0
some 41 per cent said they lied about their appearance making them self - conscious and 11 per cent said they were depressed because of their looks			0
another nine per cent admitted to lying about being in pain and three per cent claimed they needed treatment because their health was being impacted – for example , some people who wanted a nose job claimed the shape of their nose was making it hard for them to breathe			2
@entity59 , partner at @entity35 , said : ‘ we ’re shocked to hear how many people lie and trick their way into getting cosmetic surgery or other aesthetic treatments for free purely due to vanity			2
‘ while we understand that some people may genuinely feel their lives are being affected by their hang - ups , many are just taking advantage of the @entity4 and trying to get something for free that would usually cost them a lot of money			2
most commonly people lie that their appearance is making them self - conscious or that their looks are causing them to suffer from depression			2
some even claim they are in pain ‘ these @entity23 are taking nurses , doctors and surgeons away from patients who genuinely do need their help – not forgetting to mention the risk that goes with any surgery , regardless of how necessary or unnecessary it is			1
‘ unfortunately , there are a large number of cases of medical negligence each year whereby doctors and surgeons are too busy tending to other patients to help those who really need it			0
' our advice would be for @entity23 to try and deal with their body hang - ups and only look for surgery or treatment where it ’s truly necessary			0

many patients claim to have low self - esteem or depression to meet criteria
others lie about being in pain to ensure they meet @entity4 criteria for surgery
some even claim they need the surgery to *improve* their *physical* health
