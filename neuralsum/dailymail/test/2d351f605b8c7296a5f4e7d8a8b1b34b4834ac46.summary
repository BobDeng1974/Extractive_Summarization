former @entity1 defender @entity0 insists @entity2 will be welcomed back to @entity3 ' with open arms			1
' the club 's record scorer has not been spotted at his old stomping ground since his surprise appearance appeared at last month 's general meeting to see the board which axed him as boss swept out of power			1
it was a fleeting visit as the 53 - year - old crept into the ground just moments before shareholders gave @entity18 's bid for power their blessing , before hurrying away afterwards			0
@entity2 will be welcome back to the club ' with open arms ' according to club legend @entity0 @entity2 was removed from the manager 's office back in december as relations with the old board crumbled and has spent the four months since on garden leave			1
the terms of his contract mean the nine - in - a - row favourite can not return until his 12 - month notice period expires			2
but @entity0 insists @entity18 's team will never turn their back on a man who struck 355 goals in @entity36 - even if his tenure as manager ended in disappointment as @entity40 romped towards the @entity42 title			1
the former @entity44 manager , himself , was made an outcast under the old regime after branding former directors @entity48 and @entity50 ' rats ' but along with former skipper @entity51 , he has now joined @entity18 in the directors box for home matches			0
@entity2 is @entity1 record scorer but was axed as manager amid speculation surrounding the clubs future @entity0 - helping to promote the @entity57 fans group - said : ' i know what @entity59 went through as manager			1
i worked under him when @entity61 was in charge			0
' i knew the problems he had dealing with @entity65 and things never improved after that			0
' if you do n't have the man at the top of the tree working with you then it is always going to be a hard shift			0
it proved to be that way and it took its toll on @entity59			0
' but the @entity1 fans love @entity59 and i 'm sure in time he will be welcomed back at the club with open arms			1
' people can criticise the football played at the time but remember , he was dealing with the worst board in @entity1 ' history			2
to work under those circumstances must be difficult			0
' @entity59 will be back in there at some stage and i know it will be sooner rather than later			2
' he has got @entity1 in his blood and is loved by the supporters for what he did during nine in a row			2
whether they were critical over his term as manager or not , they remember what he gave to the club			2
' @entity0 says that the fans love @entity2 and he 'd always be welcomed back at @entity3 @entity0 was a long - term critic of former chief executive @entity101 and the men who followed him onto the board			1
but he has no issue with @entity18 becoming the club 's new ruler			2
the @entity108 - based businessman has delayed his coronation as chairman while he tries to prove to the @entity111 he is fit and proper			0
but @entity0 said : ' @entity18 has got @entity1 at heart			1
he 's got money to put into the club - @entity1 need that money			1
' whatever happens at the @entity111 happens			0
but i think @entity18 would be good for @entity1 , especially with the guys he has brought with him such as the three bears and the money he will generate for the club			1
' @entity18 has bought the shares and put his money up , so he should be given the opportunity to take up the chairmanship			0
@entity124 is now in charge of the @entity42 side and has impressed since taking over ' the previous board took tens of millions of pounds out the club and i would like to see @entity111 think long and hard			2
' @entity18 will be sanctioned to go ahead and build @entity1 back up to the club that i remember , capable of winning trophies			1
' one of the new board 's first acts was to appoint @entity124 as interim boss until the end of the season			0
@entity0 believes his former @entity3 team - mate should keep the job full - time - but he does not think @entity1 should even contemplate hanging around in the second - tier for another season if they can help it			1
he said : ' @entity124 has done great and given himself a great opportunity of getting the job			0
i hope he gets it			0
' @entity1 are a massive club , the biggest in @entity145			1
they have been out of the top division for too long			0
' the simple answer is that @entity1 need to be back up there now			1
' @entity1 will challenge @entity151 if they get back into the @entity147			1
' there will be a big turnaround in players			0
whether it 's @entity124 or someone else , they will be able to attract players good enough to compete against @entity151 in the next year to two years			0

@entity1 legend @entity0 insistent @entity2 can return to the club
the former @entity162 boss left the club following speculation over *ownership*
@entity0 says that fans love him and would welcome him back at @entity3
