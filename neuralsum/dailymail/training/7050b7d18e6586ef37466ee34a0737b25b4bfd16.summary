@entity0 extremely critical of @entity1 , says former colleague @entity3 edges slightly ahead of @entity0 in latest poll @entity5 promised last night to establish a permanent base on the moon by 2020 if he 's elected as @entity9 president			1
@entity0 , the former @entity10 speaker , told a packed room that he wanted to develop a robust commercial space industry in line with the airline boom of the 1930s , leading to a permanent base on the moon			1
on a campaign stop ahead of the @entity21 primary next tuesday , the @entity23 presidential hopeful told an audience in @entity25 , on @entity21 's space coast , his plan would benefit ' science , tourism and manufacturing '			0
the claims appeared to thrill the 700 - strong crowd			0
the region is primarily known for @entity45 and was still suffering from a round of federal cuts to the space program last year			0
according to the @entity54 , @entity0 said : ' by the end of my second term			1
we will have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be @entity9 ... does that mean i 'm visionary ? you betcha			0
' he added : ' we clearly have the capacity that @entity65 and the @entity66 will never come anywhere close to us			0
' @entity0 's grandiose claims to the @entity21 space community came as one former @entity10 colleague , who worked with @entity0 in the 1980s under @entity1 , described his relationship with the former president quite differently to @entity0 often fondly remembers in speeches			1
@entity73 , former assistant secretary of state , said that rather than @entity0 working side by side with @entity1 he was often extremely vocal in his criticism			1
insults : a former colleague has accused @entity0 ( right ) of fighting with @entity1 ( left ) calling the former president 's foreign policies ' failures ' while he was part of his administration in the @entity84 , mr @entity73 wrote that @entity0 's opinions of @entity1 's plans to defeat @entity87 were scathing			1
he quotes @entity0 in 1986 , as saying : ' measured against the scale and momentum of the @entity92 empire â€™s challenge , the @entity1 administration has failed , is failing , and without a dramatic change in strategy will continue to fail			1
. president @entity1 is clearly failing			1
' ' by the end of my second term			0
we will have the first permanent base on the moon and it will be @entity9 ... does that mean i 'm visionary ? you betcha			0
' @entity5 mr @entity73 , who was also a deputy national security adviser to @entity104 , added that @entity0 often refused to support @entity1 in his political decisions - and that he was often wrong in this choice			1
a poll taken before monday night 's debate between the four remaining candidates - @entity3 , @entity5 , @entity110 and @entity111 - showed little between frontrunners @entity3 and @entity0			1
former @entity113 governor @entity3 lead former house speaker @entity5 by just two points in @entity21 , showing how close the race in a key primary had come			1

former senator @entity110 garnered 13 per cent support while representative @entity111 won 10 per cent			0
the poll was conducted across @entity21 after the @entity123 primary last weekend where @entity0 beat @entity3 by 12 points , reviving his campaign and showing that the race for the @entity23 nomination was far from over			1
the intensity of the @entity23 race lead to vicious attacks by the frontrunners			0
at forums in @entity21 , @entity3 and @entity0 needled each other over immigration policy in the state , where 13 per cent of registered voters are @entity137			1
@entity0 also took the opportunity to ridicule rival @entity3 's call for self - deportation of illegal immigrants as an ' @entity144 - level fantasy ' that would be inhumane to long - established families living in @entity146			1
@entity3 in turn accused @entity0 of pandering to a @entity137 audience and said the former speaker himself had supported self - deportation in the past			1
appealing to all voters : @entity23 hopeful @entity3 campaigns at a @entity9 - @entity153 at at @entity154 , in @entity155 , @entity21 @entity0 criticized @entity3 's immigration policy during a forum with the @entity159 - language television network @entity160 , saying the idea of self - deportation would never work			1
@entity3 retaliated later in the day at the same forum			1
during a debate earlier this week , @entity3 said he favors self - deportation over policies that would require the federal government to round up millions of illegal immigrants and send them back to their home countries			2
advocates of @entity3 's approach argue that illegal immigration can be curbed by denying public benefits , prompting illegals to leave the @entity9 on their own			2
' you have to live in a world of @entity178 bank accounts and @entity180 accounts and automatically $ 20 million income for no work to have some fantasy this far from reality , ' @entity0 said , alluding to details in @entity3 's income tax returns that were made public on tuesday			1
' for @entity3 to believe that somebody 's grandmother is going to be so cut off that she is going to self - deport , i mean this is an @entity144 - level fantasy			2
' however @entity0 's campaign has spoken of the self - deportation policy he ridiculed yesterday			2
battling on : supporters applaud @entity23 presidential hopeful @entity110 during a campaign rally at the @entity197 in @entity198 , @entity21 ' i recognize that it 's very tempting to come out to an audience like this and pander to the audience , ' @entity3 said , pointing out that @entity0 has previously made comments supporting the idea of self - deportation			1
' i think that was a mistake on his part			0
' at the forum , @entity0 spoke instead about other elements of his immigration plan , including controlling the border and establishing a guest - worker program to better manage the influx of immigrants			2
@entity0 said he favors a path to citizenship for illegal immigrant children who serve in the military but not for simply completing college			2
@entity3 defended his opposition to allowing the children of illegal immigrants to pay in - state tuition at @entity9 universities			2
he said there are inexpensive options that will allow them to go to college			0
@entity0 told @entity160 he believes states should charge in - state tuition rates for students who were born in the @entity9 to illegal immigrant parents , but that he favors charging out - of - state tuition for children who were brought to this country illegally			2
@entity0 began the interview by speaking a few halting phrases of welcome in @entity159 , saying ' buenos dias estudiantes ' but begged off when moderator @entity244 pressed him to go further			2
@entity3 did not speak any @entity159 during his interview			2
@entity3 was asked about family members he has living in @entity247			2

@entity244 asked @entity3 if he had a claim to being @entity251			0
' i do n't think people would think i was being honest with them if i said i was @entity251 but i 'd appreciate it if you 'd get that word out , ' @entity3 joked			0
both candidates addressed the future of communist @entity259 after their interviews			0
in a speech on @entity146 policy , @entity0 said the @entity9 needs to take a more active role in demanding change in @entity265 's @entity259 , much like it did to encourage the @entity267 spring movement that toppled autocratic leaders in @entity269 and the @entity270			0
' i do n't think it 's ever occurred to anyone in the @entity10 to look south and propose a @entity274 spring , ' @entity0 said			0
' if [ former @entity276 president @entity275 ] @entity275 was bad , @entity265 is worse			0
' @entity3 , who has significant support from the @entity274 - @entity9 political establishment in @entity155 , railed against @entity265 's regime in a speech before several hundred @entity274 - @entity9 democracy activists			0
' it is time for us to strive for freedom in @entity259 , and i will do so as president , ' he said			0
' we must be prepared to support the voices for democracy in @entity259			0
