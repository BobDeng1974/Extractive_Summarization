‘ i 'd first like to start out by saying how terrible i feel for you and all your friends that on a daily basis have to endure mean words written by people you do n’t know			0
not amused : sgt @entity28 and @entity13 ( left ) wrote a sharply phrased letter calling out actress @entity4 ( right ) for her controversial remarks hero : @entity13 , 28 , was awarded a @entity33 after being wounded in an ied explosion while serving in @entity35 in 2008 ' i can only imagine the difficulty of waking up in a 12,000 square foot @entity39 home and having your assistant retrieve your @entity43 , only to see that the battery is low and someone on twitter ( the social media concept that you and all of your friends contribute to on an hourly basis to feed your ego and narcissistic ways ) , has written a mean word or 2 about you			1
' sgt @entity53 continued in this derisive vain , suggesting that @entity4 , 41 , should ' receive a medal ' for enduring verbal abuse online at the hands of ' meanies			2
' @entity4 was outside @entity60 at @entity62 's @entity61 speaking to @entity64 executives tuesday when she made the offhanded remark drawing a comparison between cyberbullied celebrities and soldiers in a war zone			1
family man : @entity13 , who is married and has two children , wrote that unlike @entity4 and other celebrities who have nannies and life coaches , military wives have to do everything on their own ' it 's a very dehumanizing thing			1
it 's almost like how , in war , you go through this bloody , dehumanizing thing , and then something is defined out of it			0
my hope is , as we get out of it , we 'll reach the next level of conscience , ' she told the audience			0
@entity13 , a @entity33 recipient , hit out at @entity92 , calling her ' insecure and mentally weak ' for comparing his own and other service members ' devastating experiences on the battlefield to her life of comfort and leisure - an assertion he described as ' dehumanizing			1
' a military mom 's wrath : @entity103 , wife of ex-pow senator @entity104 and mother to two soldiers , has come out swinging over @entity4 's suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war in 2008 , @entity13 was injured in @entity35 in an ied explosion			1
in his letter , he talks about seeing his friends get killed and lose limbs in firefights			0
‘ let me be the first to burst your bubble : a long line at @entity121 , your driver being 3 minutes late , a scuff mark on your $ 1200 shoes and a mean tweet do not constitute difficulty in the eyes of a soldier , ’ he wrote			0
@entity13 , 28 , of @entity129 , is married and has two children			2
he noted that unlike celebrity wives and mothers who have a team of consultants , nannies and life coaches to help them run a household , military wives have to do it on their own			0
sgt @entity13 was not the only on to attack ms @entity4 for her questionable comments			1
@entity103 , the wife of former pow @entity104 and the mother of two soldiers , called @entity4 ' a joke ' on @entity143			1
' her life is like taking bullets for a soldier			0
what a joke ! my 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her , ' @entity148 stated			0
not holding back : @entity104 's tweets came after @entity4 's comments while speaking at a tech conference			1
she 's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician 's wife it was a small part of what she said while sharing a stage with tech ceos , but was more than enough to infuriate the war hero 's wife			2
@entity163 and former presidential hopeful @entity104 was was taken as a prisoner of war as the third generation naval officer served as a pilot in @entity167 in 1967			2
senator @entity104 's plane was shot down by friendly fire and he would eventually spend five and a half years as an horifically abused prisoner before coming home to receive the @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity177 military honors			2
@entity103 on wednesday offered up a helpful suggestion to the @entity180 actress and self - styled lifestyle guru			0
' perhaps @entity4 should go out on patrol with some soldiers			2
kind of like a @entity185 in her mind i guess ! ' she tweeted			1
while the @entity190 founder 's appearance at the conference was a reaction to malevolent online attacks on her and her famous friends , any good it could have done has likely now been erased			0
which is nothing new for the recently single @entity4			0
a week before news of her ' conscious uncoupling ' from husband @entity199 broke , the 41 - year - old infuriated working women across @entity202 when she said they had it easier than famous acting moms			0
family affair : @entity104 's fury was fueled by the fact that her sons @entity209 ( left ) and @entity210 ( with @entity104 at right ) are both military men she had her reasons : @entity104 , pictured here with mrs. @entity103 at an @entity215 game this month , was an horrifically abused prisoner of war in @entity167 for five and a half years ' i think it 's different when you have an office job , because it 's routine and , you know , you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening , ' she told @entity224 ' i think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as , of course there are challenges , but it 's not like being on set			2
' many women were put off by the comments , but none as famously as mother @entity234 who made headlines with her open letter to @entity4 published in the @entity237 on march 27			1
' thank @entity239 i do n’t make millions filming one movie per year is what i say to myself pretty much every morning , ' is one of many zingers in @entity244 letter , which no doubt helped put the normally aloof @entity4 on the defensive			0
on may 8th , she responded to the anger over her working mom comments with a @entity190 in which she drew a different sort of parallel with armed combat			0
co-parent : @entity4 's estranged husband @entity199 - who she recently separated with after 11 years of marriage - returned to @entity60 on thursday , where they still share a home together in the post titled ending the @entity260 , @entity4 wrote : ' why do we feel so entitled to opine , often so negatively , on the choices of other women ? as the mommy wars rage on , i am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women , ' she wrote			1
for her part , @entity103 used thursday 's whirlwind of publicity around her attack on @entity4 to help publicize a good cause			0
' happy to have joined @ @entity274 to chat about # humantrafficking and @entity4 crazy statement , ' @entity104 tweeted			2
spreading the word : @entity104 tweeted about @entity4 's comments repeatedly in what appeared to be her attempt to make sure the off - handed comment did not go unnoticed			1
