@entity1 sen. @entity0 on tuesday became the latest @entity2 to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from president @entity5 in order to pacify her electorate			1
at a debate last night against her @entity11 opponent , former @entity12 sen. @entity10 , @entity0 was asked a ' yes or no ' question about whether she approves of the job that president @entity5 is doing			1
@entity0 completely ignored the ' yes or no ' premise of the question , and replied , ' in some ways i approve , and some things i do n't approve			1
' her dodge drew roars of laughter from the audience			0
' like most questions that we deal with as policy makers , there are n't simple answers , yes or no , ' she quickly added			0
on tuesday @entity0 became the latest @entity2 to find herself in the awkward position of having to distance herself from president @entity5 in order to pacify her electorate @entity41 candidates ' level of coziness with the president and his polices has become a critical issue in the midterm elections			1
@entity11 have sought to capitalize on the president 's unpopularity by tying their opponents to him in every way possible , and @entity41 have tried to avoid @entity5 without denouncing him			1
@entity10 has made @entity0 's history of supporting the president 's agenda a key part of his offensive in the @entity57 race			1
his favorite line of attack against his former colleague is that she 's voted with the president 99 percent of the time			0
early in tuesday night 's debate @entity10 trotted out the allegation and claimed ' it means she was the deciding vote for @entity67			2
' ' she ’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time , ' @entity10 added			2
later in the debate @entity0 was given the opportunity to respond , and she did n't deny @entity10 's claim about support for @entity5 's agenda			1
instead , she pivoted to her record of creating jobs in @entity1			0
a fact - checking website in @entity1 said last year that it 's ' mostly false ' that @entity0 was the ' deciding ' vote in favor of the president 's health law , but it ruled yesterday that @entity10 's accusation that she votes with the president 99 percent of the time is ' mostly true			1
' the main discrepancy in the claim seems to be that earlier in her career she only voted with @entity5 98 percent of the time , according to @entity97 's analysis , though she 's voted for his policy proposals 99 percent of the time since			2
the attack on @entity0 is particularly poignant given that 55 percent of @entity100 are unhappy with president @entity5 's leadership , according to an oct. 10 poll			1
@entity0 's opponent , former @entity12 sen. @entity10 , accused her of voting with the president 99 percent of the time			1
@entity0 neither confirmed nor denied the claim			0
instead she began talking about her record of creating jobs president @entity5 made it even more difficult for @entity41 in close races - like @entity0 - earlier this month when he claimed that while his name is n't on the ballot , his polices are - ' every single one of them			1
' on monday he put vulnerable @entity41 back in the hot seat when he claimed that even the members of his party running away from him ' vote with me			0
' ' they have supported my agenda in @entity124 , ' he said			0
the @entity125 tried to downplay the significance of @entity5 's comments on tuesday , saying that it 's individual candidates whose names are on the ballot at the end of the day			2
furthermore , the president 's remarks were meant to help excite his core fans to vote this fall , @entity125 spokesman @entity133 said			2
' the fact of the matter is ... democrats who are running in red states , blue states and in so - called purple states , are going to need the strong support of those voters who supported the president in his reelection campaign , ' @entity133 argued			0
polls show @entity149 by three points on average			0
taking the surveys ' margins of error into account , the race could be tied , putting @entity10 in striking distance of a political comeback			0
after losing his @entity57 seat to @entity160 in the 2012 general election , @entity10 relocated to @entity12 ' neighbor state @entity1 in order to challenge @entity0 , who is up for reelection this november			1
@entity41 have accused @entity10 of being a carpetbagger whose only interest is getting elected to public office			0
@entity168 spokesman @entity167 said on tuesday that @entity10 's ability to keep the race between he and @entity0 close is telling			1
' since august , @entity41 have thrown the kitchen sink and everything under it at @entity10 , and he is now in a statistical dead heat against @entity0 , ' @entity167 said			2
the @entity176 laughed off the possibility of a @entity10 win on tuesday , however , and characterized him as a has - been			0
' @entity10 was a good candidate for 15 minutes five years ago , and now he acts like he ’s @entity180 in @entity181 , ’ @entity179 , @entity176 spokesman , told @entity182 on tuesday			0
' every morning he wakes up and pretends it ’s still january 2010			0
' that january @entity10 was competing in a special election to fill late @entity12 sen. @entity186 's seat			1
his @entity41 opponent , state attorney general @entity187 , made a number of missteps in the shortened campaign season , and @entity10 improbably won the election			2
@entity10 wo n't be so lucky this time , however , @entity179 said			0
' the fact is that @entity0 is one of the most popular senators in the country , and every poll shows voters know that @entity10 is out for himself and not the people of @entity1 , ' the @entity41 spokesman said .			2

@entity1 sen. @entity0 was asked if she approves of the job that president @entity5 is doing
she completely ignored the ' yes or no ' premise of the question , and replied , ' in some ways i approve , and some things i do n't approve '
