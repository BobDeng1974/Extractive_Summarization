high school student @entity5 said : ' i started developing my acrobatic skills by teaching myself a variety of flips and moves on the trampoline			1
' then once i had mastered that trick , i 'd do them on the ground			0
' after doing thousands of flips , it was quite easy to start incorporating basketball shots into them			0

' @entity5 has uploaded the impressive trick shot videos to his @entity52 page and @entity54 account where he has started to build a growing fan base			1
@entity5 has shown off his skills online , including difficult long distance shots , making tricky shots from a back or front flip and hitting the target from a trampoline no way ! @entity5 tries a back flip shot in his garden in @entity17 surely not ! @entity5 tries a back flip three - pointer as his friend watches on he added : ' i often get asked how long it takes to make the shots			1
on average each video of a flip trick shot takes a couple of days to make			2
' first i have to come up with the idea , then make sure it is actually possible to do			0
' then i have to practice the flip enough so that i actually feel comfortable doing it with a ball in my hands or feet and feel confident enough to make the shot			0
' then we have to film it which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how the shot goes			0
on average around an hour in a half to make the trickiest shots			0
' @entity5 cartwheels towards the ball before he grabs hold of it just at the right moment @entity5 releases the ball while he 's in mid-air the ball nestles in the basket and @entity5 has scored			2
