by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 14 march 2014 an overweight cat survived being shot at with an airgun after the pellet became lodged in his rolls of fat , missing his vital organs by just inches			0
@entity11 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , found her pet cat @entity15 , who weighs 1 stone 2lbs , in a distressed state when she arrived home from work last month			1
the rescue cat was licking and washing himself uncontrollably and when miss @entity11 , 32 , inspected him she discovered a small round bullet wound in his fur - caused by an airgun			1
a @entity13 cat survived after being shot at with a gun pellet after the bullet became lodged in his rolls of fat			2
owner @entity11 , said that the fact that her cat @entity15 was ' a bit fat ' saved his life she rushed the cat for emergency surgery , costing £ 450 , but vets were baffled when they failed to find the pellet despite cutting through his stomach and searching through his intestines in case it had caused internal bleeding			1
the mystery was eventually solved when they discovered the pellet lodged in the cat 's rolls of fat			2
they were even more astonished when they realised the fat had prevented the metal pellet reaching his internal organs - thus potentially saving his life			2
miss @entity11 , whose fiance is called @entity59 , said : ' the vets had to cut him open into his abdomen - they thought it could be in his intestine or liver - they ended up cutting open his stomach from top to bottom			1
' it ’s lucky he loves his food - the fact that he ’s a bit fat saved his life			0
' vets are now hoping the pellet stays lodged in the piece of fat so that the risk of lead poisoning remains ' minimal '			0
but miss @entity11 was left with no choice but to dip into money that she had saved for her wedding to fund @entity15 's surgery			1
describing the ordeal on february 22 , she said : ' @entity15 was acting funny , he was licking and washing uncontrollably - there was no blood but he was skulking up the stairs - i knew something was wrong			0
an x-ray carried out by vets showed a bullet lodged inside @entity15 's upper body ' i looked him over and found a perfectly round hole , i rushed him to the vets immediately , i was terrified			1
' @entity15 is still being monitored by vets to make sure that he does not develop lead poisoning			2
miss @entity11 said : ' it makes me feel sick right down to my stomach that someone could harm an animal like that			2
' if your animal gets hit by a car or natural disease it is heart - breaking , but it is life			0
you do n’t expect someone to shoot your cat			0
' it is just pure evil			0
' miss @entity11 said that the actions of the thugs who targeted @entity15 were ' pure evil '			1
she urged other owners to check their cats for small pellet wounds if their animal becomes unwell she now hopes that other owners in the area will stay vigilant and check their pets for small pellet wounds if they become unwell			1
miss @entity11 said : ' if you say a cat has been shot you expect a big bullet wound and pouring blood , but it just is n’t			1
if it is left too late there is nothing they can do			0
' it goes in and sits there , and potentially they can end up with lead poisoning			0
' we have been very lucky with @entity15 , and hopefully he will go on to make a full recovery			0
' miss @entity11 is urging other owners to check their cats for ' small pellet wounds '			1
