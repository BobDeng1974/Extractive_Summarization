by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 06:33 est , 12 october 2012 scientists testing the lasers on @entity3 have discovered startling similarities to a matter found on @entity6			1
researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the @entity11 , but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on @entity6			1
the make - up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like @entity17 and @entity18 , as well as in continental rift zones like the @entity20 , which extends from @entity21 to @entity22 , @entity23			1
more than meets the eye : the rock as more like the unusual types found on oceanic islands such a @entity17 and @entity18 referring to rock formed from molten material , @entity3 scientist @entity30 , from the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , said : ' it was a bit of a surprise , what we found with this rock			1
but it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on @entity11			2
' @entity3 arrived on @entity11 two months ago to learn if the most @entity6 - like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life			1
last month , @entity3 's laser was used to zap the football - sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised material , as well as tiny pits left behind , to determine its chemical composition			2
scientists found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock examined by previous @entity11 rovers @entity60			1
the rock , named after a @entity63 rover engineer , @entity62 , who died shortly after @entity3 's landing , was also rich in feldspar - like minerals , which provided clues about the rock 's history			2
the @entity11 : @entity3 arrived on @entity11 two months ago to learn if the most @entity6 - like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life exploring another world : a picture taken by @entity3 's camera shows fine sand taken from the surface of @entity11 @entity3 named the rock after the late engineer @entity76 , who was the surface operations systems chief engineer for @entity77 and the project 's @entity3			1
he passed away on august 20 , at age 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous @entity82 @entity11 rovers : @entity83			0
geologist @entity84 , from the @entity85 in @entity86 , compared the make - up of the rock to how hard apple cider was partially frozen in big barrels during the winter in colonial times			1
he said : ' the way in which this type of rock forms ... is like how applejack liquor was made			0
you 'd crystallise out ice and you 'd make more and more and more concentrated apple - flavored liquor			0
' @entity103 inside a planet can undergo a similar process , he added , saying it takes very particular conditions on @entity6 to produce this type of magma			0
@entity84 said : ' you melt the interior and it comes to the surface and , just like the applejack , when you cool it , it crystallizes			0
' meanwhile , the rover has moved on to testing and cleaning of its soil scoop			0
eventually , scientists want to funnel soil samples to @entity3 's onboard laboratory for more extensive chemical analysis			0
the rover is part way to its first science target , an area known as @entity124 , which has three different types of rock intersecting			0
the car - sized @entity3 landed inside a giant impact basin called @entity129 , located near the @entity11 equator , for a two - year , $ 2.5 billion astrobiology mission , @entity82 's first since the 1970s - era @entity133 probes .			2

scientists testing @entity11 rover 's lasers discover it is more similar to an unusual rock found on @entity6
@entity143 make - up of the @entity11 rock is the same as ones found in @entity17 and @entity18
