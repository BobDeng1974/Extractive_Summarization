@entity0 has admitted @entity2 's misfiring strikers deserve the criticism they are getting			1
the @entity2 have managed only 23 goals in their 28 @entity6 fixtures to date this season , a return which has left them perched perilously close to the relegation zone as the season reaches crunch - point			1
perhaps even more worrying is the fact that @entity15 's pool of frontmen has contributed just nine of those goals , a record @entity0 knows simply has to improve if they are to avoid a second successive scramble for top - flight survival			2
@entity2 striker @entity21 has only managed two goals since his january arrival from @entity24 ' i would n't say the criticism of the strikers is unfair , ' admitted @entity0 , speaking to the @entity28			1
' strikers are going to get the most at any club because they are the money - makers , they are the ones that the fans are relying on to score the goals			0
that 's where the criticism can come			0
' chances come and you do need to put them away			0
the way we set up , we are setting up to attack at times when we get the ball			0
we do try to break as quickly as we can when we get the ball			0
@entity0 , who has scored just three league goals this season , says @entity2 attack must do better @entity0 , 21 , scored one of his three @entity6 strikes this term against champions @entity52 ' we have done it in games but we have to get more consistent with it and get in to the box more			1
we will climb away from the rest of the group down there if we can start to put our chances away			0
' @entity61 international @entity60 is currently leading the way for the strikers with four goals - the same number as midfielder @entity66 - with @entity0 having managed three and january arrival @entity21 two			1
@entity68 is yet to score for the club , while @entity70 , who left the @entity71 for @entity24 in an exchange deal with @entity21 in january , did so having found the back of the net just three times in 52 appearances in all competitions			2
@entity2 face @entity78 - the only @entity6 club to have scored fewer goals with just 15 to date - at the @entity71 on saturday with three points crucial for both sides			1
@entity78 , who ended a run of seven league defeats on the trot with a 2 - 1 home victory over derby rivals @entity87 on march 3 , currently sit three points clear of the bottom three with their hosts a point better off			0
@entity60 and @entity21 will be hoping for better luck in front of goal when they play @entity78			2
