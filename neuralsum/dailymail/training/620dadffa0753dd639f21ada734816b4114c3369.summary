' it was part of my job within the “ unknowns ” to take them across the border to hand them over to others			0
i do n’t even remember some of the names , is n’t that terrible ? ’ murdered : at least two high - profile @entity6 operatives have linked the @entity8 leader ( right ) to the murder of @entity11 ( left ) , the mother of ten who was brutally abducted , executed and secretly buried in december 1972 @entity13 ’s interview continued : ‘ i drove away @entity11 , a very , very unpleasant woman			1

‘ i had a call one night and @entity3 was in a house down the @entity123 and she ’d ( @entity11 ) been arrested by @entity125 ( a female wing of the @entity6 ) women and held for a couple of days			1
she got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the @entity130 to a place of safety			0
‘ it was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul - mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border			0
she went on and on about “ them provies , they would n’t have the balls to shoot me ... i do n’t care what i did ”			0
i was saying to myself , “ please do n’t say any more ” , but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth			0
it was n’t my decision to disappear her , thank @entity149			0
‘ you do n’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person , as she was , but you do deserve to die if you are an informer , i do believe that			0
particularly in a war , that is the @entity155 way			0
’ removing her body : the mother of ten 's body is removed from an area near @entity162 beach in @entity163 researchers at @entity43 last year lost a @entity166 challenge in the @entity41 when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the @entity70 launched a high - profile legal challenge			2
so far , 11 have been handed over relating to the @entity11 case			2
@entity43 said yesterday : ' we are not privy to the actions of @entity174 law enforcement and have had no involvement in the matter since the @entity41 court issued the order to remand portions of the archived interviews last year '			2

@entity191 said @entity11 was killed on @entity3 ' orders denial : @entity3 has repeatedly denied involvement in @entity11 's death or the @entity6 policy of ' @entity223 ' the wild card in any prosecutions could be a former @entity6 man called @entity227 , 77 , who had a bitter split with @entity3 in the mid- 1980s			1
@entity227 ’s interviews , if accepted as admissible evidence , could be used against @entity3 because @entity227 is still alive			1
@entity227 was charged in march with aiding and abetting in the murder of @entity11 , which he denies			1
