for 36 years @entity0 has captivated audiences in a world of fantasy through their comical performances of incredible craftsmanship			1
circus barriers were broken down when two already well - known @entity10 groups - @entity7 and the @entity9 - came together and founded @entity0 in 1977			1
they developed unique play and group creativity , extraordinary physicality and a playful relationship between spectator and performer			2
the @entity10 performance group 's first act was in 1978			2
what separated @entity0 from other circus acts was their contemporary performances , including cabaret , popular music , comedy , movement , visual and music theatre and physical performance			1
@entity29 , professor associate at the @entity30 has worked with @entity0 for four years on an interactive exhibition that includes never - seen footage			2
he said there is a real unique attitude that is projected by the performers in @entity0 ' the performers are doing extraordinary things but what is really amazing is there is a real connection with the audience , ' mr @entity29 , told @entity41			1
' there is a sense of real people and closeness that is established - the audience really cares about what they [ performers ] are doing and who they are			0
' @entity0 has performed on every continent and tens of thousands have flocked to see their artistic performances			2
' the sense of humour is an important part of what they do			0
sometimes it is a bit bent , satirical or has a political bite and other times it is really wacky and silly			0
it has a nice combination of being able to not take themselves too seriously , ' mr @entity29 said			0
each show crosses boundaries as acrobats walk on tight - ropes , play with fire , jump from high ceilings and swing from the roof top			0
bright coloured lights and eccentric costumes are used to tell their unique fantastical story			0
' circus is the theatre of the impossible and @entity0 has always approached the impossible in its own irreverent way , ' said mr @entity29			1
now the @entity82 will be unlocked with the release of rarely - seen footage at the @entity85			2
' vault sets out to embody this spirit of playfulness within the form of its displays , ' mr @entity29 said			0
' there will be lots of different things for different people to discover			0
for some it will be the spectacle of the beauty and grace of seeing bodies doing amazing things - which is what circus is all about			0
' the ' vault ' is presented by @entity85 in association with @entity103 and the @entity104 and will be free to the public from october 10 to october 26			1
a few years later , after practicing in her bath at home , @entity121 was able to perform the contortion underwater			0
the box was converted to hold liquid and in this version @entity129 ( pictured , left ) returned to @entity0 and played ' the shortest , fattest , loudest woman in the world ' whilst @entity121 performed her daring underwater contortion act ' the performances are built on teamwork rather than individual stars , as acrobats work together to entertain audiences through innovative craftsmanship @entity116 said , ' @entity0 contains nothing but 100 % human animals , but that â€™s never stopped us from taking on the guise of various creatures from the animal kingdom			1
most recognisably @entity10 , completely iconic and extending back to the beginning of @entity0 are the red kangaroos who have created chaos and humour around the globe			1
not to be contained to the stage the red kangaroos have been photographed in various locations including @entity154 @entity153 , @entity157 mayor @entity155 and @entity158 ' they developed unique play and group creativity , extraordinary physicality and a playful relationship between spectator and performer @entity0 was the amalgamation of two already well - known @entity10 groups - @entity7 and the @entity9 @entity85 will showcase never - seen before footage of @entity0 that is expected to blow people away their remarkable history will be explored through a multi-screen kaleidoscope comprising of 11 video artworks @entity0 's first show was in 1978 and since then they have been world leaders in contemporary circus			1
