by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:18 est , 4 december 2013 a new mother nearly died after her c - section wound became infected with @entity5 - leaving her with a 10 - inch hole across her stomach			1
@entity8 , 30 , gave birth to her son @entity10 in september 2012 in a south @entity12 hospital but soon became aware she had contracted an infection			1
despite undergoing life - saving surgery , having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs , the @entity5 could not be brought under control and she was warned she could die			1
lucky to be alive : @entity8 , 30 , gave birth to her son @entity10 in september 2012 but her c - section wound became infected with @entity5			1
she believes the only reason she is alive today is due to copper - infused pyjamas which fought the bug , developed by family friend @entity25 ( left ) she believes the only reason she is here today is because she wore copper - infused pyjamas which killed the infection			1
when she arrived at hospital in labour , she was rushed into theatre as she was suffering from compilcations			0
ms @entity8 said : ' they told me i would need an emergency c - section but i do n’t remember much of it as i was drifting in and out of consciousness			1
' several hours later her son @entity10 arrived , weighing 7.6lbs			1
‘ i was dizzy and exhausted after giving birth , ’ said ms @entity8			2
' my c - section scar spread 10 inches from hip to hip and i was in excruciating pain			1
' it hurt too much to hold @entity10 but nurses gently placed him on me a few hours later			2
but i did n’t feel great , and i was kept in because my blood counts were abnormally high			0
' but it soon became clear that ms @entity8 , who lives with her long - term partner @entity45 , 31 , a chef , had also contracted an infection			1
despite this , ' the hospital has never confirmed where the infection came from and has said there is n’t enough evidence to be sure , ' she said			2
lifesaver : despite undergoing life - saving surgery , having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs , the @entity5 could not be brought under control and ms @entity8 was warned she could die			1
she believes the only reason she is here today is because she wore copper - infused pyjamas ( pictured ) which killed the infection ' they told me my scar was n’t healing properly and i had an open wound , but they did n’t show me it when they changed dressings			1
' i had no idea quite how bad things had got - although the overpowering stench of rotting flesh made me realise something was terribly wrong after a few days			2
‘ i felt really embarrassed and did n’t want my partner coming near me			0
on top of this , because i was on a cocktail of antibiotics i was n’t allowed to breastfeed @entity10 and i could barely hold him for longer than a few seconds because of the pain			2
’ on 25 september , 20 days after giving birth , ms @entity8 was discharged from hospital with @entity10			1
at this point , she still did n’t know what the infection was			0
but a day later , a district nurse visiting her was so concerned she sent her back to her gp , who told her she needed urgent treatment			0
ms @entity8 said : ' by now , none of the antibiotics were working and the wound had doubled in size			2
my gp said to go straight back to the hospital as an emergency as it had all the signs of @entity5			0
‘ you could smell me from 10 feet away			0
we knew in our hearts that this was n’t just an infection , it was more sinister			0
’ @entity5 : at its worst , the infection left ms @entity8 with a 10 - inch gaping hole			1
she was only discharged once it got to this stage too scared to return to the original hospital she ’d been a patient at , she underwent life - saving treatment at @entity114 on october 6 , 2012			1
after the surgery , she was kept in hospital for five days while doctors monitored her recovery			2
she was even given maggot therapy - where live maggots were placed in the open wound to eat away the dead flesh - but the infection was so severe the maggots died			1
by this time , a family friend had heard about ms @entity8 's condition and said copper might be able to help			2
@entity25 , 18 , had spent 18 months researching antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which proved bacteria could n’t survive on copper			0
with this in mind , she approached @entity135 inventor @entity134 and the pair produced a pair of copper - infused pyjamas for her friend			1
ms @entity8 said : ‘ @entity25 brought me copper pjs , bedding , socks and a hospital gown - and all had been lab proven to be anti mrsa			1
' at first i was sceptical about the copper - infused pjs , but within a a couple days i felt much better and noticed the open wound was decreasing in size			1
the nurses took swabs from my stomach daily and they always came back infected with @entity5 , but a few days after wearing the copper - infused clothing , they came back negative			1
' they could n’t believe it and thought there had been a mistake			0
they took another one just to be double check			0
to our amazement , it was negative ! the infection was gone and the open wound was shrinking			2
we were lost for words			0
it was at that point i knew i was n’t going to die			0
’ ‘ you would n’t think something so simple could make such a huge difference but i could feel the difference in my skin almost overnight			0
instead of feeling lethargic i felt brighter , more alert and healthier			0
more importantly , i was healing			0
’ in the days and weeks that followed , she ontinued to ‘ live in ’ her copper pyjamas and nurses commented on how quickly she was healing and were positive the nightwear was behind her speedy recovery			2
surgery : ms @entity8 underwent life - saving surgery at a different hospital , @entity179 , as doctors battled to fight the superbug ravaging her body ‘ i cherished them after that , ’ says ms @entity8			1
‘ i would n’t take them off			0
medics said it would take me a year to recover but by @entity188 , less than two months later , i was back on my feet and feeling normal again			0
copper is known for its healing powers and it really accelerated the process for me			2
’ as part of their research , @entity193 ( the company formed by @entity195 and ms @entity25 ) collected a 1cm square sample of ms @entity8 's @entity200 gown and another from the copper infused material			1
both were washed at 65 degrees and sent away to be tested under stringent ' mrsa protocol ' in a laboratory			0
after 24 hours , over 400 million superbug bacteria were picked up on the @entity200 fabric whereas the copper - infused material had no superbug bacteria			1
over the years , copper oxide has become an increasingly popular component in health products because of its natural anti-microbial and healing properties			1
already , in countries such as @entity217 , hospital staff and patients wear copper - infused clothing as a matter of course			1
now , one year on , @entity223 is clinically trialling the pioneering clothing after hearing ms @entity8 's success story - believing it could revolutionise the @entity200 , who are fighting an ongoing battle against increasingly antibiotic resistant superbugs such as @entity5			1
pioneering : @entity230 spent 18 months researching antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which proved bacteria couldn ¿ t survive on copper mr @entity236 and gynaecologist at @entity238 , said : ' this clothing may have the potential to make a real difference to the way in which we treat ulcers and infection in patients , based on the research i have seen which was available on the subject			2
' we believe that the laboratory - based research looked very promising and there is now a need for controlled clinical trials			0
we are in the process of setting up a clinical trial to establish the medical medical benefits of this clothing			0
' ms @entity8 said : ‘ hospitals up and down the country should make copper - infused clothing and bedding mandatory for all staff and patients			1
' i was so terrified i was going to die i could n’t bond with my newborn baby			0
every time i looked at him , i wondered if he ’d soon be motherless			0
it was a horrific time and i honestly believe that i owe my life to the @entity270			0
‘ if it had n’t have been for them , i do n’t think i ’d be here today			0
i had maggots placed into my stomach to eat away the rotting flesh and surgery to cut away at it , but it only really improved when i started wearing the @entity270			1
i would n’t take them off after that			0
’ ms @entity8 is now back working as a barmaid and is enjoying motherhood			2
‘ i do n’t take anything for granted now , ’ she says , ‘ i appreciate every second with my partner and son and do n’t worry about the small things anymore			0
i do n’t want anybody to go through what i did and that ’s why i ’ve chosen to speak out			0

@entity8 , 30 , gave birth to her son @entity10 in september 2012
c - section scar soon became badly infected and she had 10 - inch gaping hole
despite undergoing life - saving surgery , having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and medication , the infection continued
eventually tried copper - infused pyjamas which she says killed the infection
*chemical* has been shown to have *anti-bacterial* and healing properties
pyjamas are now being trialled in hospital in *tje* fight against superbugs
