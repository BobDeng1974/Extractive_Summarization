the @entity0 is to launch a device that will warn motorists about faults in their cars before they break down			0
the matchbox - sized device , called the @entity6 , transmits data about the car before and after every journey by slotting slots into a car 's computer system			1
the automated system means that drivers then receive a phone call , text or email telling them there 's a fault with their car			1
pioneering : the @entity6 gathers data on a vehicle by slotting into a socket beside the steering column and using 3g technology if the car breaks down or has an accident it will automatically alert an @entity0 breakdown team with the vehicle 's location and details of the problem			1
the miniscule device slots into a scart socket beside the steering column , where mechanics and technicians connect diagnostic equipment			0
it can then detect engine and gearbox problems , monitor imminent battery failure , battery drain and alternator problems			0
the device also checks for brake wear , throttle problems and whether the diesel filters have become clogged			0
@entity50 will be able to access data on their car remotely , using a mobile , tablet or @entity55			1
the early warning system builds on current telematics technology that utilises 3g connectivity			2
information : the device records information about the car 's performance to @entity0 before and after every journey and will automatically alert @entity0 staff if the car breaks down with its location miniscule : the tiny device , which will be available to all @entity0 members in 2013 , is only the size of a matchbox if an @entity0 team is contacted with a problem they can access the onboard diagnostic software remotely to identify the fault			1
it will also act as an instant alert to the rescue service in the event of a serious accident - providing a record of time and location record for the motorist			2
all of the @entity0 's 1,700 patrol vehicles have already been fitted with first generation devices and more than 35,000 fleet vehicles in the @entity89 are using it			2
the device will be available to @entity0 members during 2013 , with its price added on to subscription charges			0
quick response : when a customer breaks down @entity0 staff will be able to determine a vehicle 's whereabouts and gather information about the problem before they respond @entity0 technical director @entity102 said : ' offering peace of mind in a box , @entity6 will revolutionise how we deal with our members			1
' some breakdowns can be avoided with a preemptive warning and intervention and this will significantly advance how we are able to deal with a breakdown or accident			0
' with an accurate fault diagnosis and vehicle location , our patrols will be able to reach members more quickly and where possible , prepared with appropriate replacement parts			0
' our promise is to be the motorist 's champion and our aim is to make it easier , safer , and more affordable for our members to own and run a car			2
