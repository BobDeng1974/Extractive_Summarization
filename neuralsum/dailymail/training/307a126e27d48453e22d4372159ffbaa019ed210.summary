@entity7 - based @entity6 company said thursday that it has been manufacturing its original - flavor @entity3 without @entity8 for the past several weeks in response to consumer demand			2
it did not specify exactly when those boxes would be on sale			0
original @entity3 will now be labeled as ' not made with @entity13			2

' we were able to do this with original cheerios because the main ingredients are oats , ' said @entity23 , noting that there are no genetically modified oats			1
varieties other than @entity34 -- such as @entity35 ( pictured ) -- will remain unchanged and still contain genetically modified ingredients the company is primarily switching the cornstarch and sugar to make the original @entity3 free of @entity8 , he said			1

@entity6 says they will soon be making all original cheerios from non-genetically modified ingredients
other varieties like @entity65 and @entity66 will stay the same
