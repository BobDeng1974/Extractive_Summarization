he is known as one of @entity3 ’s most dapper newsreaders ... but it will take more than a little concealer to cover @entity7 ’s blushes after the @entity9 anchorman was broadcast touching up his own make - up live on air			1
the clip , which has caused much mirth across the internet , catches the polished host giving himself a sprucing up , not realising that the cameras are rolling			1
at first he is seen applying a touch of foundation to his forehead – using what appears to be his own compact – then momentarily rolling his shoulders and sucking his cheeks			2
scroll down to watch @entity25 it : @entity3 newsreader @entity7 was filmed readying himself for a broadcast without realising the cameras were rolling he moves on to his tie , tugging and teasing it into its best shape and ensuring that he has not allowed it to slip down from his collar			1
ever the professional , @entity7 then gives himself a proper grooming , sweeping his shoulders with the palm of his hand to make sure there is no hint of fluff – or anything else – on his suit shoulders			1
but then , as he begins to remove an errant piece of lint from his cuff , there is a terrible pang of realisation			0
a member of the production staff on @entity3 ’s digital news channel has clearly informed him that he is in fact grooming himself live on air			1
the newscaster lets out a furious ‘ what ! ? ’ , the clip ends – and before he knows it , @entity7 ’s blooper is the talk of the internet			1
happily , the @entity60 has taken the episode in good spirits , calling it one of the hazards of the job			2
wuh oh : when the newsreader realised he was on live television he shouted ' what ! ' the clip has become a hit since it was posted on the internet he said : ‘ it was a technical problem and simply one of the hazards of the trade			1
' i ca n’t believe it ’s been of such interest , but i am delighted that so many people are watching our digital news channel news now			0
and yes , i ’m back to the desk as normal again today ! ’ the clip was an immediate hit online when it emerged on wednesday night , but much to the dismay of many , @entity3 then removed it from its own play - back service and @entity87			1
a spokesman for the station insisted that it was not an effort to censor people ’s enjoyment of the clip but rather to ensure that @entity7 approved of the clip ’s circulation			1
reporting the news live on air requires perfect composure – but from time to time even the most professional presenter can crumble under pressure			1
and in the age of viral videos , viewers from all around the world can now enjoy a chuckle at some of the most memorable news bloopers			0
one particularly entertaining clip shows what happened when unsuspecting jobseeker @entity111 – who believed he was being interviewed for a job at the @entity114 – is mistaken for @entity116 expert @entity115 by a @entity118 team and interviewed live on air			1
hilariously the @entity121 graduate was questioned by the @entity114 24 - hour news team about an @entity124 ’ @entity116 company vs @entity116 computers court case that was in progress at the time			0
in the clip from 2006 , which now has been watched by over a million people on @entity87 , mr @entity111 is shown looking nervous but manages to answerthree questions			2
he later told the team that he was ‘ happy to speak about any situation ’ on air but would like more time to prepare his answers			2
mr @entity111 ’s ordeal has gone down in the annals of notable bloopers and there is never a shortage of others to fill the funny reels			0
in another memorable case , some frisky alpacas lent an unexpected @entity146 edge to a presenter ’s report for a popular breakfast show in @entity150 when they started to mate in the background of her clip			2
and when the duo failed to cease quickly , the embarrassed reporter told viewers : ‘ i am sorry to all of the parents out there watching with children			0
you ’ll have to have that conversation now			0
’ closer to home , @entity3 ’s @entity162 was also caught out when the camera cut to her during a link with @entity166 and viewers watched as the news anchor pursed her lips to prepare for the update , unaware that the camera was firmly on her			0
a spokesman said : ‘ when we knew it had been uploaded , our first instinct was to ensure that @entity177 was okay about it			0
’ ‘ he was not aware that the clip had been put up , so we took it down from our own player and @entity87			2
it was n’t his fault ; it was a technical error			0
since then , we ’ve learned that @entity177 is not unhappy about it and is fine with it			0
so we are not going to pursue it			0
’ in fact , the clip has only increased @entity7 ’s popularity			1
viewer @entity187 wrote on @entity188 : ‘ i do n’t think there is a person in the country who does n’t love # aengus more now than they did when they woke up this morning			0
’ stylist @entity195 wrote : ‘ i ’m in love with @entity7 , i mean the man has his own compact			1
’ the newscaster is no stranger to the blooper reel and going viral on the internet			0
just last month , a clip of him struggling with a malfunctioning autocue over a news report about the 40th anniversary of the @entity210 mission became a viral hit .			2

newsreader @entity7 did not know that the cameras were rolling
when he realises that he is live on air he shouts ' what ! ' before clip ends
clip soon became a hit when it was posted online before being removed
he described the *incident* as ' one of the hazards of the trade '
