by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 01:45 est , 6 september 2012 a quarter of people who go on to be diagnosed with cancer have to go to their gp at least three times before being referred for a hospital test , a major report shows			1
the government 's £ 450million programme should have allowed women to get chest x-rays more quickly many are still waiting far too long , despite millions being invested in giving family doctors quicker access to crucial tests			0
according to the @entity19 ’s own survey , nearly one in ten patients saw their gp five or more times before finally being referred to hospital			1
a further 16 per cent – nearly one in six – had to see their family doctor either three or four times			1
cancer survival rates in @entity25 are far lower than those in other @entity28 countries , largely due to late diagnosis			1
in an attempt to remedy this , the government last year invested £ 450million in a four - year programme to make it easier for @entity34 to send their patients for tests			2
this included allowing them to be referred directly for ultrasounds , chest x-rays and brain scans instead of having to see a consultant , who would decide if this was needed			2
but the results of the department ’s @entity46 for 2011 - 12 imply that the initiative is having little effect			0
of the 71,793 patients who took part , 25 per cent had seen their gp at least three times before being sent to hospital			1
this is exactly the same proportion as the previous survey from 2010 , before the initiative came in			0
@entity56 , chief executive of the @entity57 , said : ‘ the survey shows that many patients get a rapid diagnosis			2
people are encouraged to consult their gp as soon as they find a lump ‘ however , it is worrying there are still big variations in the number of times they have to visit a gp before getting a referral			1
‘ the @entity70 needs to do more to help gps identify signs of cancer if potentially fatal delays are to be avoided			2
gps should be making better use of tests to rule out cancer first			0
’ dr @entity79 , gp adviser at @entity80 , said : ‘ it is disappointing there is no improvement in the past year			0
‘ spotting cancer in its early stages can make a huge difference to getting vital treatment and have a very real effect on a patient ’s prognosis			0
’ last year , @entity90 found that a quarter of @entity70 trusts are telling family doctors to send fewer patients for scans to save money			0
this summer , research by the @entity98 found the chance of being referred was a postcode lottery			0
patients in some areas were more than 60 times more likely to get sent for a scan than others			1
a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ gps have a vital role in diagnosing cancer earlier and it is important they receive the right support to assess and refer patients with symptoms of suspected cancer			1

nearly one in ten patients saw their gp five or more times before being referred to hospital
cancer survival rates lower in @entity25 than other @entity28 countries
