@entity0 sealed a third consecutive @entity1 win on sunday , turning a comfortable lead into a convincing victory by shading the singles matches			1
but how did the two sides match up across the three days ? @entity7 's @entity6 rates the twenty - four players			1
@entity0 : @entity9 — @entity11 @entity10 @entity12 for 12 years ; he came up against some inspired play from his opponents			1
5 @entity16 — @entity17 does it get much better than partnering @entity19 and clinching the winning point ? 9 @entity21 hits @entity1 winner @entity0 captain @entity23 congratulates @entity16 after he hits the crucial shot @entity16 enjoyed the perfect @entity1 debut , picking up three points , including the winning one @entity28 — @entity30 @entity29 can you imagine the @entity33 ’s status by the time the @entity1 is played in his country in 2018 ? 8 @entity35 — @entity37 @entity36 unluckily paired with @entity38 in opening fourballs during a rare off - day for @entity41			1
5 @entity42 — @entity44 @entity43 great to see the @entity45 so happy off the course and playing with such fire and passion			2
7 @entity49 — @entity51 @entity50 found team aspect tricky early on but showed class of a @entity55 champion yesterday			2
6 @entity56 — @entity11 @entity57 should have played four matches			1
inspired with @entity59 and indomitable in the singles			2
8 @entity42 ( right ) looked happy both on and off the course as @entity0 's big men performed debutant @entity59 formed a superb partnership with @entity56 on friday and saturday @entity56 's comeback on sunday turned the tide for @entity0 and was a crucial part of their victory @entity69 — @entity71 @entity70 showed how much he cared over first two days and then why he is world ’s best on sunday			1
8 @entity38 — @entity11 @entity50 curiously peripheral , apart from a couple of great shots			2
hope we have n’t seen best of him			2
5 @entity69 showed on sunday why he is the best , and the passion shone through all weekend @entity38 made one superb shot , but was n't at his best at a competition that usually brings out his best @entity81 — @entity83 @entity82 hard to imagine what more he could do			1
dug deep when he had to and some play was inspired			2
9 @entity88 — @entity17 cruel he lost singles by missing a four - foot putt			2
but a fantastic partnership with @entity93			2
7 @entity19 — @entity94 a fine job instilling belief in @entity16 and wonderful he passed @entity98 ’s points total			1
7 @entity81 was @entity0 's best player , winning four points over the three days and inspiring his team captain : @entity23 his only error was pairing @entity35 with @entity38			1
every bit the superb captain we had hoped for			0
9 @entity107 @entity108 — @entity109 did n’t unpack his suitcase after @entity112 and might need to buy another after this			0
4 @entity115 — @entity117 @entity116 unlucky to run into @entity69 in three of his matches and clearly overplayed by @entity119			1
5 @entity120 — @entity121 @entity122 and seven defeats			0
has n’t won a singles for 10 years			0
he ’s just not up to it			0
4 @entity120 lost three of his four matches as his dismal @entity1 record only got worse @entity129 — @entity11 @entity10 like @entity38 a rock at previous @entity131 and like him stuck on the sidelines this time			1
4 @entity133 — @entity121 actually played well but terribly unlucky to run into three hot @entity0 partnerships			1
6 @entity135 — @entity51 @entity10 showed a lot of heart in team aspect but then came another terrible chip yesterday			0
6 @entity140 — @entity141 stupid of @entity119 to bench him for foursomes on saturday			0
good singles win against local hero			0
6 @entity146 — @entity44 @entity147 @entity149 debut			0
joint best @entity107 on view with @entity151 and a man to build team around			0
8 @entity146 was a rare bright spot for a @entity107 team that was constantly outplayed by @entity0 @entity146 is congratulated by vice captain @entity156 and the young @entity107 finished unbeaten in four matches @entity158 — @entity160 @entity159 hard to see why he was ever chosen as a wildcard			1
just not got enough game at this level			0
4 @entity165 — @entity44 @entity43 great partnership with @entity146 that we will see in future but defeat by @entity56 will hurt			0
7 @entity165 lost his singles match but his partnership with @entity146 was excellent throughout @entity151 — @entity173 @entity172 surprise package in @entity107 team			0
quiet and undemonstrative but showed he is a real player			0
8 @entity119 — @entity177 great fun on the first tee but that was the extent of his impact			0
5 captain : @entity185 this was a @entity1 way too far for the great man			1
out of touch and it showed			0
4 @entity107 captain @entity185 had no answer to @entity0 and this may have been a @entity1 too far			1

@entity81 unbeaten in five matches for @entity0
@entity158 did n't justify selection as one of @entity185 's wildcards
@entity16 wins three out of four and hits winning shot
