by @entity0 from @entity2 sacrificing 9,000 butterflies to @entity4 scrawling the names of every one of her lovers onto a tent , some artists make a living out of pushing boundaries			0
but one young creative has pushed them to a whole new level			0
cutting - edge artist @entity12 , who shot to fame as the girl who drank coloured milk and regurgitated it over @entity16 on stage , has embarked on her most challenging work to date			1
@entity19 , as her work is called , sees the @entity22 performance artist enclosed in @entity23 , a gallery space at @entity25 in @entity26 , removed from the outside world for 168 continuous hours			1
speaking about the challenge , which began on friday and forms part of @entity26 's @entity43 week , the 27 - year - old said : ' i wanted to create a performance that embodied the transience of life			1
' i wanted to eliminate all the distractions from my daily reality in order to focus on the impermanence and fragile beauty of our existence			0
' withstanding the physical discomfort and inevitably entering into an altered mental state , @entity12 will apparently use this fast to ' enable herself to explore the depths the mind can reach , once physical comforts and limitations have been removed '			1
finding fame : @entity12 shot to fame when she drank coloured milk and regurgitated it over @entity16 in her music video , @entity66 her toughest challenge yet : surrounded by a carpet of freshly - cut flowers , @entity12 wants to immerse herself in a meditative state the public are being encouraged to follow the evolution of @entity12 's performance both in person , where she can be glimpsed from the sidewalk through the window of @entity25 's @entity23 , and via @entity77 , where the performance is being live - streamed 24 hours a day			1
speaking to the magazine about the inspiration behind her performance , she said : ' i always strive to push through my own physical and mental barriers			2
i think it ’s important to experience everything you can , on every end of the spectrum			0
' i believe it ’s important to make yourself uncomfortable and learn to separate mind and body in order to reach a raw , primal state of being			0
' a spokesman @entity95 ) said : ' the artist here is making a choice			0
purging is often an extremely secretive behaviour , something that an individual will do anything to hide from others and there certainly are negative health impacts related to purging in this way			0
' all alone : the public can follow the evolution of @entity12 's performance online , where it is being live streamed so sick : @entity16 performed on the @entity112 at @entity114 's bbq and had performance artist @entity12 throw up paint on to her quirky : young artist @entity12 has taught herself how to regurgitate paint to create quirky canvas art @entity119 : sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around @entity121 in trucks became part of her everyday adventures the eccentric artist - whose unique work features in @entity127 - is better known for her ' vomit art ' , whereby she uses a selection of dyed soy milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows at various intervals , one at a time , before vomiting it onto a white canvas			1
but despite the regular retching , @entity12 insists it does n’t affect her health			2
she said she maintains a healthy vegan lifestyle and always leaves a one month rest period between each performance			0
the vomiting visionary began experimenting with her unique style back in 2005 and has since gained commercial success by regurgitating onto the dress of pop singer , @entity16 , in a controversial music video			1
@entity12 can be seen vomiting shimmering turquoise liquid over the singer in @entity151 's pop music video , @entity66 , and starred on stage with her			1
however , @entity153 is n't a fan			0
as she kicked off her tour in @entity157 , fans were treated to a video montage of her sticking her finger in her mouth and spitting up blue and green paint , in what could be perceived as a mocking nod to @entity16 's infamous vomiting performance at @entity165			1
the video showed @entity153 vomiting the paint over herself and the walls			0
it was similar to @entity16 's performance with @entity12 at the @entity171 at @entity114 's bbq earlier this year			1
born in @entity174 to @entity119 parents and spending much of her youth in @entity178 and the @entity179 , it is clear where @entity12 ’s maverick tendencies originated			2
aged 13 and unable to relate the @entity182 children of her neighborhood , @entity12 befriended local street punks			2
from then on , sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around @entity121 in trucks became part of her everyday adventures			0
after a brief summer stint in @entity190 , @entity12 returned to @entity191 at the age of 17 where she embarked upon her artistic journey in performance art and film .			2
