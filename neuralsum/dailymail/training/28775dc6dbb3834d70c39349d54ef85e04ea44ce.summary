by @entity0 a top fashion designer has been slammed by a broadcasting watchdog after he praised young irishmen for ' damaging @entity5 virgins '			1
@entity6 - whose designs are sold in @entity8 and @entity9 - provoked outrage with the remarks about @entity13 emigrants in @entity14 , where he lives			1
' the @entity5 , they love us and they hate us , you know , you just have to put up with that , ' he told a live radio show in his native @entity13			1
anger : @entity13 - born @entity6 , pictured on the catwalk at @entity25 with two models , told a radio show young @entity13 emigrants to @entity5 ' are doing great and damaging a lot of young @entity5 virgins ' challenged : the @entity32 presenter asked mr @entity6 ( pictured with former @entity34 @entity33 ) if he was a chauvinist , which he denied			1
but the @entity13 radio watchdog said the broadcaster could have done more ' certainly the @entity13 are never short of chatting up and , you know , we have that skill and i ’m sure these young guys are doing great and damaging a lot of young @entity5 virgins , so there you are , and good luck to them			1
' presenter @entity48 questioned whether the designer was a ' chauvinist ' - which he denied			2
it was then alleged a text message to the show complaining about mr @entity6 was ' laughed off '			0
born in @entity55 , the designer built his empire from wealthy @entity57 in west @entity14 the comments on @entity32 's @entity59 show in february drew two official complaints to the broadcaster , one of which was elevated to the @entity64			1
the upset listener , @entity65 , branded the remarks repugnant and dangerous to women			0
@entity32 agreed a number of listeners were offended by the comments , but said they could be construed as a flamboyant and heavy - handed description of young @entity13 men living in @entity14			2
the broadcaster insisted it was a throwaway remark during a ' fast - moving ' live programme on a side issue to the main thrust of the interview			0
but the watchdog disagreed , saying the show could have used a delay button or used the presenter to deal with on - air risks			2
the watchdog 's ruling said : ' it was the opinion of the committee , following its review of the material , that the manner in which sexual relationships were described by the guest would cause undue offence and that the programme makers had not taken due care in the way in which the comments were handled during the programme			1
' in particular , it was the view of the committee that the presenter ’s tone and his answer to his own question in respect of whether his guest had displayed chauvinism did not display due care in respect of the sensitivity of listeners who , in the opinion of the committee , might reasonably view the comment as offensive			0
' born in @entity55 , the designer has been at the helm of @entity114 high street fashion for decades and established his brand at a flagship store in @entity57 , west @entity14			0
in 2010 he was picked as one of six @entity13 fashion designers to be honoured on a postage stamp			2
an @entity32 spokesman told @entity121 : ' to the best of our knowledge there were two complaints sent in relating to the @entity128 interview			0
' we have no further comment to make in relation to the @entity64 decision which we accept			0
' the full statement of the @entity64 decision will be broadcast shortly before @entity59 programme starts tomorrow morning			0
