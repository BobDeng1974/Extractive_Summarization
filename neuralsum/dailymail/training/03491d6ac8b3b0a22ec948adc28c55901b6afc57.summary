@entity0 found their fizz again in a 5 - 1 win over @entity4 that will further fuel the debate over whether they are better off without @entity8 striker @entity7			1
@entity7 ’s hamstring injury meant @entity11 ’s young forward @entity10 started his first game for @entity0 and the 21 - year - old had scored his first goal within 17 minutes			1
@entity15 played in @entity16 and his cross was turned in by the new no 9			2
dream start : @entity20 jumps on to @entity10 's shoulders to celebrate his goal that put @entity0 2 - 0 up against @entity4 in @entity23 breaking away : @entity15 escapes a challenge from @entity4 midfielder @entity25 as @entity0 exerted their authority in the midfield areas easy does it : @entity31 is congratulated after his cheeky chipped penalty put @entity0 ahead inside the @entity11 stadium in @entity34 new face : and before long @entity10 was doubling the lead after a smart passing move which saw him presented with an open goal in his hometown muted celebration : @entity41 jogs back towards the half - way line after his penalty reduced the deficit to just one goal in the first half @entity0 : @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity31 ( @entity50 68 ) , @entity16 ; @entity51 , @entity20 , @entity52 ( @entity53 77 ) , @entity15 , @entity54 , @entity10 ( @entity55 57 )			1
scorers : @entity31 16 ( pen ) , @entity10 17 , busquets 45 +3 , @entity20 50 , @entity54 90 +1			1
booked : @entity52 , @entity15			0
@entity4 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 46 ) , @entity64 , @entity25 ( @entity65 64 ) , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 74 ) , @entity69 , @entity41			0
scorer : @entity41 28 ( pen )			0
booked : @entity66 , @entity67			0
@entity0 were already leading 1 - 0 after @entity31 dinked in a @entity73 - style penalty on the quarter of an hour mark after @entity20 had been brought down – the @entity77 defender repeating the trick from @entity0 ’s success in the last @entity80			1
more impressive than the quickly established two - goal lead was the way the reigning champions of this competition were playing			2
without the reference point of @entity7 upfront the passing was shorter and crisper and there was far more movement as @entity20 , @entity54 and @entity15 buzzed around the new centre - forward , and full - backs @entity90 and @entity16 got forward to provide width			1
@entity7 is yet to score for @entity0 in five games having switched allegiance from his country of birth @entity95 and played in @entity0 ’s disastrous @entity98 campaign			0
the free - flowing forward football did not prevent @entity4 briefly getting back into the game when @entity41 scored from the spot after @entity16 had brought down @entity64			2
@entity0 soon got their third when @entity10 turned provider this time for @entity51 who scored his first international goal from the edge of the area with a deflected shot			1
the second half started with @entity47 justifying his selection ahead of @entity112 goalkeeper @entity111 , keeping out @entity113 with a fine save and it did not take long for @entity0 to make it four down at the other end when @entity48 got around the back of the visitors ’ defence and pulled the ball back for @entity20 to score			1
it was his 21st goal for @entity0 – of non-strikers only fellow midfielder @entity122 has scored more			2
back in the game : @entity41 's @entity4 team - mates congratulate him after he successfully converts the spot kick conceded by @entity16 the bosses : @entity127 was back after offering his resignation after the @entity98 and came up against @entity4 boss @entity129 on the touchline combative : @entity31 goes in hard for this header up against @entity4 's @entity66 during an aerial clash in the first half in @entity11 dominant : @entity134 's @entity54 takes the ball away from grounded @entity4 defender @entity59 as @entity0 made their opponents work taking control : @entity138 midfielder @entity52 , one of the newer members of @entity0 's starting line - up , brings the ball forward in the middle of the park it should have been five on the hour when again @entity0 got down the @entity4 right with @entity20 pulling the ball back to @entity15 who smashed his shot against the bar			1
@entity15 was now sharing false - nine responsibilities with substitute @entity55 who had replaced goal hero @entity149 – this really was the old @entity0 , playing without a recognised no 9			2
@entity54 was the next to find himself in centre - forward space but he pulled his shot wide after being played in by @entity15			0
he finally got in on the act in injury time with a fine finish from a @entity20 pass			0
with 10 minutes left @entity0 had brought on @entity157 for his debut aged just 19 years and seven days			0
the @entity134 striker has a @entity161 mother and @entity163 father and was playing in the level below @entity134 ’s b - team last season			0
his cameo and the performances of @entity10 show that @entity0 have plenty left in the locker as they look to defend their @entity80 crown			0
what remains to be seen is how @entity8 ’s @entity7 fits into @entity127 ’s brave new world			0
making sure : @entity51 accepts the congratulations of @entity15 after he made it 3 - 1 in the closing stages of the first half in @entity11 gesture : @entity179 celebrates his goal with a hand sign after putting @entity0 back in charge in this @entity34 qualifying opener for the @entity185 champions @entity161 sensation : @entity187 playmaker @entity20 points to the sky after his smart finish made it four for the home side in the second half @entity193 's stamp of class : @entity20 celebrates after he knocked the ball past the goalkeeper to make it 4 - 1 to @entity0 in @entity11 warm embrace : @entity48 and @entity52 are the first to congratulate @entity20 as he boosts @entity0 's goal difference in what should be a straightforward qualification group @entity0 's supremacy in midfield : @entity8 man @entity15 helped the home side to take control at the @entity23 stadium against the hardworking @entity4			1

@entity0 started with eight players from the @entity210 campaign - @entity209 did *n't* make too many changes
@entity31 scored opener for @entity0 with a cheeky *paneka* chipped penalty after @entity20 was brought down
@entity10 doubled the lead after @entity16 beat the goalkeeper to a chipped cross that went across the area
@entity16 then gave away a penalty allowing @entity41 to halve the deficit from the spot past @entity47
@entity51 *restored* the two - goal *cushion* with a low deflected strike just before the half - time whistle
@entity20 's low strike across the goalkeeper made it 4 - 1 to @entity0 as they showed their style in this *big* win
@entity15 had the chance to make it five but he *thumped* the crossbar after getting to @entity90 's cross
@entity134 *youngster* @entity243 came on for the last 23 minutes for his debut to cap a dream few weeks
@entity54 chipped in with the fifth after @entity20 's pass to make it an even more resounding win in *stoppage* time
@entity20 now has more goals than any other non-striker for @entity0 apart from @entity122
