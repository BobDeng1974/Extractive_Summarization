by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 10 august 2013 high flier : @entity2 took up burlesque dancing to counterbalance her £ 150,000 city job after a decade in a high - flying job in the @entity6 , @entity2 thought she had seen and heard it all : traders who used their expense accounts to take clients to strip clubs ; colleagues openly mingling with prostitutes and vile sexist language bandied about on a daily basis			1
there was the 40 - year - old trader who had a heart attack and died at his desk			1
and another who threw a tantrum in the office – sweating profusely and sniffing constantly then screaming ‘ you bitch ’ at her before he smashed her phone against the wall			1
he had not even bothered to wipe the tell - tale smudge of white powder from his nose			1
so when the disenchanted internal auditor took up burlesque dancing – swapping austere daytime suits for pink sequins , spangles and feathers in the evening – she never suspected it would end her £ 150,000 - a - year career			1
now , instead of auditing the professional behaviour of traders , @entity39 has adapted their characteristics to feature in her routines			1
in one dance she begins dressed as @entity47 ’s unscrupulous @entity46 trader @entity45 and morphs into @entity49 ’s @entity48 in a basque covered in bank notes			1
she works under the name @entity52 and performs for an audience dominated by men – but one over which she says she has total control			1
‘ when i took up burlesque in 2003 i was working at @entity58 , ’ says @entity39 , 36			1
‘ i liked it because it countered the testosterone - fuelled environment of my working life			1
‘ even though i was the pudgy , pasty - faced girl in the corner of the burlesque class i appeared to have a talent for it			1
i did keep it secret from the bank			2
compared to the behaviour of those around me on the trading floor , it seemed a harmless hobby			2
’ but in 2008 , when she was working for another major bank , a colleague sent an email to her employers containing a video clip of her performing at @entity82 cabaret bar madame @entity80 ’s			1
pressure : @entity39 says drugs are rife among city workers under immense stress @entity39 had just been promoted but was accused of bringing the firm into disrepute – a charge which carried the threat of instant dismissal			1
‘ i was in shock , ’ @entity39 recalls			2
‘ i cried , broke down and rang my lawyer			2
the sheer hypocrisy of it was just astonishing			2
the banks quietly condone the poor behaviour of male traders but i was being faced with the sack			2
’ it was september 2008 , the time of the financial crisis			2
‘ you would have thought the banks had more to worry about , ’ she says			2
but @entity39 was subjected to a painful and painstaking eight - month - long investigation			1
the final 200 - page report from the bank ’s human resources team , who had studied the video of her dancing , included comments that she stroked her leg during her act , and that her breasts ‘ wobbled ’ when she danced			1
‘ they pulled everything out of context , ’ @entity39 says			2
‘ they made it seem smutty			2
’ in september the following year she finally left in disgust , forced out by the ‘ sexist ’ bosses who refused to discipline her colleagues			1
exposed : @entity39 was disciplined when it emerged at the bank that she was also a burlesque dancer today she is more interested in her performances and has transformed her act to bring comedy – and her experiences of banking – into her act			1
‘ my audiences are a mixed crowd of men and women – the women “ get it ” when there ’s satire and comedy , which after all is in line with the origins of cabaret			2
’ @entity39 is also releasing an explosive new book , @entity144 , in which she lifts the lid on what really takes place on the trading floors of the @entity6 ’s biggest banks			2
she claims that at @entity58 male colleagues openly boasted they were going to clubs to ‘ get some slags ’ , and that one of her managers – a married man with children – invited her into his office and wanted her to mark him out of ten for his naked body			1
there were also sexist insults on the trading floor			2
‘ the big screens on the trading floor were supposed to show news clips but they were showing women ’s aerobics , on a loop , ’ she said			2
far more seriously she was appalled to discover fraudulent traders creating fake trades to boost apparent profits to secure their jobs and their bonuses			2
‘ i audited one trader who later was investigated by the bank			2
the sum involved was around £ 300 million , ’ she said			2
‘ i was then told that was the fifth trader who had been investigated for suspected fraud that year			0
’ she claims drug taking was rife			0
‘ i never saw the traders take drugs , but i witnessed their behaviour , ’ she says			0
‘ they were n’t taking drugs in a party way , it was to survive and cope with the stress			1
’ the eldest daughter of an architect father and mother who is a nurse , @entity187 - born @entity39 opted for a career in the @entity6 in 2000 after gaining a politics degree from @entity193			1
‘ i never saw the traders take drugs , but i witnessed their behaviour			0
they were n’t taking drugs in a party way , it was to survive and cope with the stress			1
' @entity2 ‘ it was one of the few jobs that paid enough to allow me to move out of home and buy a flat on my starting salary , ’ she concedes bluntly			1
‘ i do think i was perhaps naive			0
’ but by 2002 , when she was working as an internal auditor for @entity58 , she was beginning to dislike the sexism and policies she saw on the trading floor			1
‘ i am a bolshie and brusque personality so i assimilated with the culture quite easily , ’ she said			0
‘ but then there was a big sex discrimination case brought by @entity212 who had been the head of the private wealth division			0
she was the only female head of a department			0
@entity216 she resigned and sued @entity58			0
‘ it was at that point that the scales began to fall from my eyes			0
because i worked in internal audit i was responsible for investigating traders			1
i realised that every trader i saw had been white , and male			0
’ around the same time @entity39 was up for a pay review and had been discussing with a male colleague , who did the same job and got the same promotion , what their salaries and bonuses were likely to be			0
@entity233 : @entity39 as her burlesque alter ego @entity235 , left , and her book , right when he came out of the manager ’s office he triumphantly revealed the figures , expecting she would get the same result			1
but when i went in the figures were different , ’ she said			0
‘ he had got £ 60,000 and a bonus and i had £ 57,000			0
we had the same performance scores and reputation			0
‘ when i told the boss i knew about this he was furious and said we should n’t have been discussing it			0
they later offered to pay me more – even more than my colleague – as long as i kept quiet about it			0
‘ i thought , “ wow this sexist stuff does really exist			0
” it was the first clue i had that i would have to fight to be treated equally			0
‘ @entity58 was like a boys ’ club where everyone was trying to do the @entity45 thing			0
’ ' the pressure on the traders was immense			0
they looked like sick dogs who did n’t know how to get out			0
they were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic			0
' @entity2 but if @entity58 was a boys ’ club , @entity39 says the other bank was ‘ a grim treadmill ’			1
‘ the pressure on the traders was immense , ’ she said			0
‘ they looked like sick dogs who did n’t know how to get out			0
they were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic			0
‘ later , when i had my own discussions with my bank ’s human resources department over my burlesque show , i talked about what i had seen in the industry			1
‘ i was told that there was no evidence that traders went to strip shows and no evidence that they took drugs			0
’ but had @entity39 never considered her double - life as a performer might create problems ? ‘ no , ’ she says			1
‘ but when i told my mother i had taken up burlesque she was appalled , and she gave me a warning : “ watch who you tell			1
” ‘ it was n’t that she thought it was shameful , but i should beware of other people ’s prejudices			0
’ after being forced out of the bank , @entity39 got an 18 - month contract with @entity303 , where she felt that despite the devastation of the credit crisis ‘ nothing much had changed ’			1
yet she insists , despite conceding she faces an uncertain future as a writer and a dancer , that she has no regrets			0
‘ i enjoyed working in banking for a time , ’ @entity39 said			1
‘ but i ’m much happier doing burlesque now and working on books			1
‘ in banking i felt i was losing my identity as a woman			0
i do n’t want to go back to that hell			0
it was a world of abuse , sexism , ruthlessness – i felt like i was wasting my life			0
‘ now burlesque has freed me from that			1
and the women in this world are bold and assertive – unlike the few pretty little female assistants you meet on the trading floors			0
‘ i ’m 5ft 8in and a size 14 but burlesque is not about how you look			1
and my role models here are women who do n’t need to take any crap			0

@entity2 was a disenchanted internal auditor working in the city
to cope with the testosterone - fuelled *atmosphere* she took up burlesque
