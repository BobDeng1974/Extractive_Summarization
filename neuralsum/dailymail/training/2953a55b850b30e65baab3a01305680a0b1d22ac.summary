scientists have discovered what triggers one of the most deadly types of breast cancer , raising hopes of new treatments for it			2
they have pinpointed a gene that drives triple - negative breast cancer – an especially fast - growing and hard - to - treat form of the disease			1
it accounts for up to one in five cases of breast cancer and is particularly likely to strike women when they are still in their 20s and 30s			1
the breakthrough , spearheaded by researchers from the @entity31 near @entity32 , brings hope of new treatments			0
the study of breast cancers from almost 3,000 women revealed a gene called @entity39 to be particularly active in triple - negative tumours			1
women with the gene had cancer that was more advanced			0
and extra copies of the gene cut a woman ’s survival chances , the journal @entity45 reports			0
experiments on mice confirmed the gene ’s importance			0
for instance , animals destined to develop breast cancer remained free of the disease when the gene was inactivated			2
and ‘ turning down ’ the gene in cells made them less cancerous			0
triple - negative breast cancer tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer			1
studies have shown it is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur after treatment			0
these risks appear to be greatest in the first few years after treatment			0
the breakthrough paves the way for new treatments for this type of the disease , which is notoriously difficult to treat			0
breast cancer cells are pictured researcher professor @entity75 said : ‘ this exciting result identifies a novel breast cancer gene in some of the more difficult - to - treat cases			2
’ dr @entity79 , of @entity80 , said : ‘ figuring out the genes that play a role in triple negative breast cancer could lead to new ways to tackle the disease			2
' this study is a promising step forward			0
' but these results are from cells grown in the lab and studies in mice , so they ’re still at an early stage			0
‘ the next steps will be finding out if the gene plays the same role in causing breast cancer in women , and whether drugs can be developed to target the faulty molecules			2
‘ @entity102 - negative breast cancer can be challenging to treat , so research into the biology of the disease is vital to help scientists come up with new treatments			1
’ this type of cancer tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer			0
studies have shown triple - negative breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur after treatment			1
these risks appear to be greatest in the first few years after treatment			0
anyone can get triple - negative breast cancer , but researchers have found it is more likely to affect : younger people : triple - negative breast cancer is more likely to occur before age 40 or 50 , versus age 60 or older , which is more typical for other breast cancer types			1
african - american and @entity127 women : triple - negative breast cancer most commonly affects @entity126 women , followed by @entity127 women			1
one study found that black women were 3 times more likely to develop triple - negative breast cancer than white women			1
people with a @entity137 mutation : when people with an inherited @entity137 mutation develop breast cancer , especially before age 50 , it is usually found to be triple - negative			1
like other forms of breast cancer , triple - negative breast cancer is treated with surgery , radiation therapy , and / or chemotherapy source : @entity147			1

@entity102 - negative breast cancer is fast - growing and hard to treat
is particularly likely to strike women when they are still in their 20s and 30s
now scientists have pinpointed a gene that drives this type of cancer
gene called @entity39 is particularly active in triple - negative tumours
