three times as many children have tried e-cigarettes as have smoked tobacco , figures show			1
they have prompted concern that e-cigs are acting as a ‘ nicotine gateway ’ for children luring them to back to more harmful cigarettes			1
a study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in @entity13 found that six per cent had tried e-cigs compared to just two per cent who had smoked tobacco			1
furthermore , those who had tried the devices were seven times more likely to admit they might take up smoking within the next two years			2
a study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in @entity13 found that six per cent had tried e-cigarettes , compared with just two per cent who had smoked tobacco ( file image ) some 14 per cent of those who ’d tried e-cigs said they might start compared to just two per cent of children who ’d never tried			1
the battery - operated devices resemble pens or cigarettes and they contain a liquid form of nicotine that give users the same rush as smoking			2
they are used by an estimated one million @entity37 trying to give up smoking but concerns have also been raised that they are luring children on to tobacco			0
the study was only carried out on @entity13 pupils and @entity44 said its own similar survey had found just two per cent of children had tried them			1
nonetheless campaigners said the findings showed the need to keep a ‘ watchful eye ’ on their use			0
@entity53 , health minister for @entity13 said : ‘ these latest findings shine further light on the potential impact of e-cigarettes on our children and young people			1
‘ i am concerned the use of e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to and re-normalise smoking , especially for a generation who have grown up in a largely smoke - free society			0
' dr @entity68 , chief executive of the @entity69 said : ‘ this research is interesting in that it is the first survey of its kind in the @entity37 to find the number of children who have tried e-cigarettes to be higher than the number who have tried smoking			0
experts have raised concerns that the devices are acting as ' nicotine gateways ' luring children to smoke ‘ this again emphasises that e-cigarettes are still an emerging and evolving technology , and that we need to keep a watchful eye on how they are being used , particularly by children			2
although there is no evidence that vaping ( smoking an e-cig ) is anywhere near as harmful as smoking , e-cigarettes are not recommended for children or non-smokers , at least until more research has been conducted into their long - term health impacts			0
‘ that said , these data on their own do n’t provide clear evidence of the so - called ‘ gateway effect ’ of e-cigarette use leading to sustained smoking			0
‘ research suggests that smoking rates amongst @entity37 children overall , while still too high , have continued to decline since the emergence of e-cigarettes last decade			0

study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in @entity13 found 6 **%** had tried e-cigs
that compared with just 2 **%** who had smoked regular tobacco
experts have *warned* devices act as a ' nicotine gateway ' for children
say they are luring young people back to more harmful cigarettes
those who *'d* tried e-cigs were seven times more likely to admit they might take up regular smoking within the next two years
