@entity0 , long - standing head of @entity1 at the @entity2 , was dismissed because he used his own camera to take the pictures rather than following guidelines to use a school - owned device or memory card			1
while none of the content of the images was said to be indecent , mr @entity0 was dismissed following the episode as he had ' failed to follow procedure			1
' the camera enthusiast deliberately flouted well - known school rules prohibiting such conduct despite previous warnings about his behaviour , the headteacher who dismissed him claimed			2
mr @entity0 today took his case for unfair dismissal , sex discrimination and age discrimination against the @entity2 , @entity34 , @entity35 , to an employment tribunal			1
the school denies the claims			2
the tribunal heard how @entity0 joined the independent school in september 2000 and was dismissed on may 20 2011			2
as the head of the @entity1 languages department he was responsible for organising trips to the @entity45 country and also co-ordinated exchange visits with @entity1 students			0
mr @entity0 also ran the school 's @entity51 participation and would accompany pupils on expeditions , often in sole charge of groups , the tribunal was told			1
it was alleged that during a week - long trip to @entity1 in april 2011 he took 870 photographs of pupils , documenting the trip			2
@entity2 headmistress @entity61 told the tribunal that safeguarding pupils ' personal data was paramount and mr @entity0 's conduct merited dismissal			1
barrister @entity67 , representing mr @entity0 , described the @entity69 teacher as a keen amateur photographer who had ' come quite late to the revolution in digital photography , ' adding : ' he was an enthusiast about @entity1 and going there on trips , the @entity51 , teaching and photography			1
' he also said mr @entity0 could appear set in his ways or old - fashioned			1
@entity79 mrs @entity61 , who qualified as a teacher in 1973 , said that schools had to take ' the utmost care ' in safeguarding information about pupils			0
in her evidence to the tribunal in @entity34 , @entity35 , she said : ' as information technology - digital cameras , the internet and social media sites such as @entity90 and @entity91 - has evolved , it has become far easier for information such as photographs and videos to be shared			2
' as a result , schools must now do everything within their power to ensure that personal data about pupils - including , for example , photographs - are used , stored and transmitted appropriately			0
' the school has a strict @entity106 policy for staff which is kept under regular review by deputy head @entity109 , said mrs @entity61 , referring to @entity111 guidance stating that photographs taken of pupils for school purposes must be taken and stored on school - owned equipment and never by teachers ' own equipment			1
mrs @entity61 , who has been a headteacher for the last 18 years with 11 of those at @entity119 , said she had suspended mr @entity0 during a phone call on may 4 2011			1
on the same day she sent a letter to mr @entity0 detailing the allegations against him , which were that he had breached school policies and refused to follow an instruction from his line manager by carrying on taking pictures when told not to			1
she also contacted the police on the advice of the @entity129 ( @entity129 ) , she said			0
just over a week later , on may 12 2011 , mrs @entity61 said she met with mr @entity0 and a trade union representative acting on his behalf			1
' there was virtually no factual dispute , ' said mrs @entity61 , a former geography teacher			0
he accepted that he had been provided with a school camera for use on the trip			0
' when asked , by his own representative , why he had not used it , he said that he had not brought it with him			0
' he accepted that he had taken pictures of pupils on his own camera			0
he accepted that this was in direct contravention of the school 's policies			0
' he was an enthusiast about @entity1 and going there on trips , the @entity51 , teaching and photography ' @entity67 , representing mr @entity0 ' he accepted that he was aware of the policy , having received updated safeguarding training less than a week before the incident			1
he accepted that he had downloaded these photographs onto his personal computer			0
' he accepted that he had refused to follow mrs @entity156 's instruction to stop taking photographs			0
' he accepted that he had breached the acceptable use policy but said he did not see anything wrong with using his own camera			0
' mrs @entity61 said she thought ' long and hard ' before dismissing mr @entity0 , adding : ' i bore in mind that the security and welfare of our pupils is our prime responsibility			1
' the incident on the school trip in april 2011 was ' not the first or even second incident of this sort , ' said mrs @entity61			0
' i consider that it would have been disproportionate to dismiss without giving the claimant a chance to demonstrate that he could follow the policy			0
' however , at the time of his dismissal the claimant had been warned on about five occasions not to take photos of school pupils on his own camera over a 12 - month period			2
' this was despite the fact that the claimant was not only given a school camera to use but knew that all staff had been offered the option of a school memory card for his or her own camera			1
' the claimant was warned formally in a meeting with his @entity194 rep on july 5 2010 and again following a disciplinary hearing in december 2010 , when he was warned that further incidents could lead to dismissal			0
' mr @entity0 had received training on child protection and safeguarding , she said , with the last session on april 8 2011 - less than a week before the trip which resulted in his sacking on grounds of gross misconduct			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) headmistress @entity61 told the tribunal that safeguarding pupils ' personal data was paramount and mr @entity0 's conduct merited dismissal mrs @entity61 added : ' i accept that it is unlikely that he personally would use these photos to cause harm but that is not the point			1
' she said mr @entity0 's actions ' made it impossible for us ever to be completely sure he was suitable to work with children ' , prompting the school to alert the @entity129			1
she also said mr @entity0 had been receiving support as a teacher for several years and had displayed a ' flagrant failure to meet and sustain his targets ' in the classroom			1
' many parents had become concerned and a selection of parental complaint letters and emails were submitted , ' she added			0
mr @entity67 told the tribunal mr @entity0 had been a keen photographer for 10 years at the time of the incident			1
pictures he had taken were even used by the school in publicity material , he said			0
mr @entity0 had been provided with a camera from the school as well as an @entity240 memory card and a usb card reader in advance of the trip , said mr @entity67			1
the equipment meant that any photographs taken using the camera could be downloaded onto any computer rather than just school machines , meaning the rules made ' no sense in practical terms , ' mr @entity67 told mrs @entity61			2
she replied : ' it 's because not everybody does act honourably that you have to have so many rules and regulations			0
' despite this , mrs @entity61 admitted she had given mr @entity0 permission to take photographs of a school trip on his own camera when they were both on a visit to @entity264 markets in @entity265 in 2010			1
' i accept that it is unlikely that he personally would use these photos to cause harm but that is not the point			0
' @entity2 headmistress @entity61 she told the tribunal : ' we were colleagues on a trip where i was trying to support him			2
i was there all the time he was with the girls , therefore i knew where the photographs were			0
' mrs @entity61 added : ' we went through what he should have done and why he should have done it and i told him what he should do next time			0
' wearing a smart grey suit over a red jumper and a white shirt with a blue tie , bespectacled mr @entity0 of @entity291 , @entity292 , looked calm as he listened intently to the proceedings			2
the @entity2 is a top independent day school for girls with more than 1,000 pupils aged between three years and 18 years old and is based in @entity297 , @entity34 , @entity35			2
