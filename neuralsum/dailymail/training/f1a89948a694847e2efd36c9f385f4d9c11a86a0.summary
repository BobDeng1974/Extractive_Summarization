@entity7 , 44 , went to @entity9 suffering from back pain and breathing difficulties when she was 37 weeks pregnant
her husband , @entity14 , claims he begged doctors to carry out tests
even though she had *previously* had breast cancer , she was sent home
nine days later she had a severe brain seizure and was rushed to hospital
@entity29 was delivered by emergency caesarean *section*
mrs @entity7 was diagnosed with cancer and died eight weeks later
*bur* the hospital says doctors were not made aware of her previous cancer and they have no record of her husband asking for tests
