' i 'd like to extend the deepest apologies to the family of @entity0 for any part we may have had in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information , ' the moderator of the @entity93 subreddit wrote in a statement			1
' we can not begin to know what you 're going through and for that we are truly sorry			0
' several users , twitter users , and other sources had heard him identified as the suspect and believed it to be confirmed			2
' the apologies did n't stop there , as @entity111 , the general manager of @entity3 , also sent out an email ' to apologize personally and on behalf of all our employees for ... some of the people on our site 's role in the spreading of this false idea about @entity120			0
' it is not clear exactly how @entity0 went from being a missing person to wrongly becoming the prime suspect in the manhunt for the @entity126 brothers			1
but it appears speculation started on social news site @entity3 , with several users claiming on the forum last thursday evening that he was being sought by thousands of police and @entity134 team officers over the attack			2
remembrance : as news spread that his body had possibly been discovered , tributes to the student poured in through his family 's @entity44 page , ' help us find @entity0 ' some claimed his name had been mentioned between officers on the police scanner and one woman who said she went to school with @entity0 alleged cctv images of one of the real suspects ' looked like him			1

yet all chose to ignore the fact @entity0 had not been named by police as a suspect			1
within hours , vile messages began cropping up on @entity0 's @entity44 page and about a dozen news vans camped outside the family 's home in @entity206 , @entity207			2
by dawn on friday , the suspects had been formally named - brothers @entity126 and @entity211 , whose family is from the breakaway @entity214 region of @entity216			0

as the erroneous reports about @entity0 continued to spread online , his family , huddled around their computers in @entity10 , @entity5 , felt helpless as internet users leveled accusation after accusation against their missing relative			1
‘ someone will tweet , then retweet , and completely unsubstantiated things can proliferate so rapidly and destructively , ’ @entity0 's sister @entity246 said in an interview on friday			2
‘ those night hours were horrible			0
’ ' it seems this is just the ugly underbelly of viral social media , ' she later told @entity270			1
' but a lot of stir can be created through just a complete accusatory and unsubstantiated effort			0
