foreign aid will cost @entity3 taxpayers £ 1billion more than expected by the end of next year because the national income has risen , it was claimed last night			1
included in the @entity6 are new figures which suggest the economy ’s size has increased in several areas , according to the @entity11			0
therefore so has the @entity3 ’s aid commitment , which is to pay 0.7 per cent of gdp			1
the revelation is expected to trigger anger from @entity17 backbenchers , who are deeply opposed to increases to the aid budget while @entity3 is still struggling to pay off the deficit			1
pictured , @entity3 soldiers distribute aid packages in @entity26 in southern @entity27 , 2003 while other departments have seen their spending slashed over the past four years , foreign aid has been ring - fenced and was set to hit £ 12billion by the end of this year			1
under the new calculations , it should rise to £ 12.4billion this year to meet the target – effectively giving the @entity34 three weeks to spend another £ 400million			0
next year , the aid budget would have to increase by £ 550million to £ 12.75billion			1
the findings come ahead of a vote in the @entity38 today in which @entity17 mps will try to kill off a @entity40 to enshrine the foreign aid target in law so it must be followed by future governments			1
@entity44 , the mp for @entity45 , said : ' it is completely idiotic to be spending so much money abroad when we are borrowing so much money ' last night , @entity50 conceded that the @entity40 may not get through and instead claimed it was more important that the @entity3 gives this money to poor countries than pass laws about it			1
it is a remarkable change of tone from the prime minister , who declared earlier this year that the massive increase to the foreign aid budget was his ‘ proudest achievement ’ in government			2
cabinet ministers are not expected to attend the @entity38 vote , which was forced by the @entity63 , although all three parties officially support the @entity40			2
@entity44 , the mp for @entity45 , has tabled dozens of amendments to hold up the debate today			0
he said : ‘ it is completely idiotic to be spending so much money abroad when we are borrowing so much money			0
’ if time runs out , the @entity40 will not be passed before the @entity72			0
even members of the @entity74 do not support the @entity40 , which foreign secretary @entity75 called ‘ bizarre ’ when asked about it last month			0
figures released by the @entity77 , seen by the @entity11 newspaper , show the @entity3 ’s national income is around £ 60billion higher than expected for this year			1
according to the newspaper , the @entity77 figures for 2015 increase the size of several economic sectors by £ 79billion – meaning an extra £ 550million in foreign aid , although the final figure is unknown			2
the budget for @entity34 has already been set for the next two years and it is understood other spending could be reclassified as ‘ international development ’			0
last night , a @entity89 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity6 confirmed that we will meet the 0.7 per cent aid target in 2014			2
the amount spent on aid in 2014/15 has not been changed			2
the 2013 spending round set budgets for 2015/16 , including maintaining @entity95 [ official development assistance , a way of measuring aid ] funding at 0.7 per cent of @entity100 [ gross national income ] in 2015			0
we are confident that existing spending plans are consistent with our aid commitments			0

@entity105 is expected to trigger anger from some @entity17 backbenchers
they are deeply opposed to increases to aid while @entity3 is still *lending*
