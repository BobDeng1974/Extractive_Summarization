the great @entity1 gamble might be on its last legs , but the final breath of air has n't been sucked out just yet			1
owner @entity5 is back from his annual @entity7 winter cruise on friday , furious with a scandalously poor run of results to have plunged the @entity10 deep into the relegation mire			1
the pensioner does not want this potential relegation to be his legacy and is considering sacking @entity1 for the good of their future			1
@entity18 ( right ) celebrates scoring with team - mate @entity19 as @entity20 sealed a vital victory @entity20 's @entity22 tussles for the ball with @entity25 's @entity24 at the @entity26 @entity20 's @entity27 challenges @entity25 defender @entity28 from behind @entity25 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity29 4 ; @entity30 5 , @entity31 5 , @entity18 6 , @entity32 6 ; @entity33 6 , @entity34 6 ( @entity35 83 , 6 ) , @entity36 6 , @entity37 5.5 ( @entity38 67 , 6 ) ; @entity39 5 , @entity24 6 ( @entity40 67 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 booked : @entity18 @entity20 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity46 6.5 ; perch 6 , @entity47 6.5 , @entity18 7 , @entity48 6.5 ; @entity49 6 ( @entity50 73 , 6.5 ) , @entity27 6.5 ( @entity51 54 , 6 ) , @entity52 6 , @entity22 6.5 ; @entity53 6.5 ( @entity54 81 , 6 ) , @entity55 6 subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 booked : @entity18 , @entity27 , @entity55 , @entity49 , @entity47 , @entity61 scorers : @entity18 17 referee : @entity64 attendance : 14,601 that consideration will need to be tempered in the coming days , however , after debutant @entity18 's 17th - minute poke against a hapless @entity25 was enough to secure the manager 's second win of a dismal three - month spell			1
they still look devoid of ideas going forward , a little shaky in possession , but the way in which the 2013 @entity76 winners battled here suggests they have the stomach to escape from this			0
' it 's a brand new group over the last three weeks , ' @entity1 said			1
' it closes the gap			0
there are a lot of points to play for			2
it 's about personality and character and we 're beginning to show that			2
' we lost @entity90 back to @entity91 and this is a brand new central defensive partnership with @entity47 and @entity18 standing firm			1
' @entity20 are a club still in a @entity95 state of confusion , aware of their alarming slide but using just blindfolds , tails and donkeys in trying to fix it			2
the appointments of @entity102 and @entity103 proved flawed ; so too does the reasoning behind luring @entity1 - then still under investigation by the @entity76 for abusive text messages sent as manager of @entity108			2
@entity18 holds off pressure from @entity25 forward @entity39 during his side 's 1 - 0 win @entity25 's @entity34 and @entity20 's @entity52 tussle for the ball it 's so far been an unmitigated disaster - @entity5 has even been banned from ' footballing activities ' himself for defending the @entity117 - but everyone around the @entity119 will be buoyed by grit and steel on display at the @entity26			1
however turgid the affair is irrelevant at this stage			2
the winner came with more than its fair share of good fortune , goalkeeper @entity29 inexplicably fumbling @entity55 's tame header inside the six - yard box for @entity18 to prod home			1
it was only their second goal in five games and that the ball went beyond the embarrassed @entity136 was the only thing to matter			0
@entity1 has been in charge of @entity20 since november 2014 when he replaced @entity103 from there @entity20 relaxed somewhat and , but for a trio of missed chances by @entity25 's loanee @entity142 , looked the more threatening - particularly when @entity22 was given time to stretch his legs on the counter			1
i 've no idea why , ' he said			0
' i 've got to look long and hard at it			0
i need a different way of playing at home			0
' it 's very frustrating			0
to be honest tonight was a little bit embarrassing ; it was so poor			0
if you see us here it 's a team who 's going to be fighting relegation			0
' i do n't think they spent any money on the pitch in the summer because of the money situation			0
' @entity1 had barked relentlessly , fidgeting on the touchline like a man whose career is reliant on this sorry mess correcting itself			2
the deep exhales told the whole story - a few more nights like these would n't go amiss , although he could 've done without the needless 11 minutes of additional time			0
@entity25 's @entity34 fends off @entity20 's @entity172 and @entity55 reading forward @entity40 closes down @entity20 defender @entity18			1

@entity18 scores the winner to help @entity20 to just the second win of @entity1 's *tortured* reign
it was a turgid affair but the result is all that matters for the struggling @entity10 , who are six points from *safety*
it is results like these which will give @entity1 hope of avoiding the drop
@entity20 host @entity190 on friday while @entity25 travel to @entity192 on *saturday*
