@entity0 found himself shouting in despair at the tv set - @entity2 had let in yet another soft goal			1
he tweeted : ‘ going to try to get myself fit and back into that defence ! ’ it was a tongue - in - cheek remark from the 54 - year - old but how @entity8 must wish for a player of @entity0 ’s calibre today			1
indeed , so must half of the @entity11			2
@entity0 is widely revered as one of the greatest defenders to play the game			1
his @entity2 captain @entity15 described him as a ‘ @entity16 of a player ’ who just happened to need a jump - start on occasions			1
these days , @entity0 ’s toughest opponent is the bottle			1
his much publicised battle with alcohol was described in all too harrowing detail in a candid autobiography , back from @entity27			1
' @entity40 is a very funny man and a good friend			2
i have huge respect for him as a fabulous footballer and a human being			0
he was a pleasure to play alongside ( with @entity47 ) because he made us a better team			0
he was born to be in football			0
his partnership with @entity52 is working and i see a team spirit that , dare i say , reminds me of when i was part of the squad			0
i know @entity56 and @entity47 would be poorer if he was n’t there			0
' home is now in picturesque @entity59 in @entity47 where ‘ the fishing is good and golf not so bad ’ and , despite the temptations placed in front of him by well - wishers , his focus is firmly set on @entity2 ’s home match with @entity69 on saturday			1
buoyed by their win at @entity72 , @entity0 believes it could prove the making of @entity2 ’s painfully raw defence			1
‘ let ’s be honest , they got out of jail , ’ he says in his @entity77 lilt			1
‘ at times against @entity72 it was like the @entity83 — they were hacking it clear when they should have been brave and passed it			1
‘ they were so nervous , but then i thought , “ you ’re doing the right thing , take no chances ”			0
they sensed @entity72 had missed their opportunity			1
@entity93 relaxed and grew into the game and @entity95 seemed to relish the responsibility of being the senior defender			1
in the end , for a young defence , it should have done them a world of good			1
’ @entity0 says young @entity93 ( left ) relaxed against @entity72 and grew into the game @entity0 says @entity95 is relishing being the senior defender as @entity2 battle injury woes @entity0 ’s affection for his old club - where he played from 1982 - 89 - is clear			1
‘ i ’d love to be playing , ’ he says			0
‘ i used to enjoy games against @entity72			1
they were the top team in the @entity110 and the way they used to strut around we did n’t much like			0
it was our other grudge match after @entity114			0
if you went in for a 50 - 50 it was important in our day to not show you were hurt			2
they called @entity119 ’ and it was easy to see why			0
there was a 50 - 50 to be won at @entity121 once - and it had to be him i was facing			2
when we collided the pain shot through my knee			0
i knew my knee was wrecked but i got up because i did n’t want to show it had hurt			0
i only hope he was sore , too , but he did n’t show it			0
‘ if you were going to win things you had to beat them and we were always looking to lay down a marker			2
that would normally come from @entity137			0
he was n’t afraid of anyone and it was n’t always about the football			0
he ’d just hope it was in the vicinity when he was ready to tackle			0
‘ the physical nature , that competition , was all part of it			0
now when i say i ’d like to play , i would but i ’m not so sure i ’d be on the pitch for long before i got a red card			0
’ as @entity0 ’s knees testify , he played in an era when tackling was expected and he cringes at the way football has become less of a contact sport			1
he believes this is partly to blame for many of the errors made by @entity2 ’s defenders			1
‘ tackling is being taken out of the game , ’ he says			1
‘ the slightest touch on the back of a striker or clip of the heel and it ’s a yellow card			0
it means the defender is worried about a red straight away			2
now a defender has to stay on his feet and anticipate more than compete			2
' @entity171 called @entity0 a ' @entity16 of a player ' who needed an occasional jump start ‘ i found that part of my game came as i got older			1
being a good interceptor comes with age and experience			2
@entity2 ’s players have n’t got that yet			1
‘ @entity181 can be a horrible , unforgiving place to learn			0
when i see @entity29 , he looks so smooth he could become a real gem but it ’s whether they give him the leeway to develop			1
everyone wants results now and pressure comes with that , which makes you nervous and leads to mistakes			0
i made countless mistakes but i was allowed to grow			0
’ @entity2 are searching for new defenders but @entity0 believes a good one will be hard to find			1
‘ they need experience but there ’s not many top - quality defenders that clubs will sell			1
‘ @entity202 is a great leader , @entity201 is similar but @entity2 are n’t the only ones with money any more			1
it may be better to nurture @entity206 , @entity93 , @entity29 and @entity95 because they can grow into better than what is in the market			1
@entity0 says young @entity2 defender @entity29 ' looks so smooth he could become a real gem ' but he fears @entity29 ( right tracking @entity72 's @entity210 ) wo n't get the time he needs ‘ they would hate me for saying it but @entity56 have @entity214 , who could help @entity2 with his experience and bring on the younger players but , at the same time , i want him to stay at @entity56			1
’ @entity217 of @entity218 would smash my teeth in and others liked a tussle but @entity114 ’s @entity223 was horrible			0
he would n’t give you any peace			0
there was a time when goalkeepers would roll you the ball and you ’d take a touch and try to look composed but @entity223 would come tearing at you with such speed you ’d think , ‘ @entity232 , am i going to have time to take this touch ? ’ you ’d be afraid he ’d catch you and you ’d make a mistake			2
luckily , he never scored against me but it was n’t comfortable			0
@entity2 ’s cause has been sorely hindered by injuries this season			1
the club once tried to persuade @entity0 to retire at the age of 29 before he gained a new lease of life with the help of @entity56 physio @entity245 and carried on playing until 37			1
he says modern footballers are not prepared to go through pain as much as players of his era			2
‘ there are too many advising players what to do and i think some have lost sight of who they are playing for			0
i remember @entity15 breaking his leg and he was itching to get back			2
in his first game , he went into a crunching 50 - 50 challenge full - blooded to test his leg			1
it was stupid in many ways but @entity15 believed he was putting his body on the line for the club and fans who paid his wages			2
‘ i ’m not sure you ’d get that today			0
we cared more about @entity2 than being injured			2
’ @entity0 says there are too many people advising players these days and forgotten what they 're playing for @entity56 's @entity214 could help @entity2 with his experience but @entity0 wants him to stay at @entity275 @entity0 ’s appreciation of being a professional footballer was all the sweeter after an apprenticeship spent making iron gates			1
he was 22 when @entity2 picked him up - ‘ i felt like the luckiest man in the world , ’ he says			1
the reverence in which he is held by the fans provides its own pitfalls , though			0
when @entity0 goes to watch his beloved @entity47 , he is often asked if he would like a drink			2
‘ i ’m sure there are players with similar problems , ’ he reasons			0
‘ that ’s the boundaries in my life			0
i still have some good friends who ring when i need it , it ’s one day at a time			2
it ’s challenging but hopefully i ’m winning			0
’ one thing certain about @entity0 , he is up for a challenge			1
@entity0 supports the @entity299 of @entity47			2

@entity2 legend @entity0 says *current* defence shows promise
he rates @entity29 but worries young defender wo n't get time to settle
@entity29 played in @entity2 's 2 - 1 win over @entity72 on saturday
@entity77 said @entity72 challenge should have done young @entity2 defenders @entity93 and @entity95 the world of good
@entity0 laments tackling is being taken out of the modern game
@entity15 described @entity0 as a ' @entity16 of a player '
