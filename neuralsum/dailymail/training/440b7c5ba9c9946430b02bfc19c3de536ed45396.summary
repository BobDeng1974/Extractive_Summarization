defence chiefs fear plans for two giant wind turbines could allow enemy jets to evade radar as their own fighter plans would confuse them as threats			2
officials at the @entity8 say the 115ft ( 35 - metre ) towers are so big they could look like planes on monitoring equipment			1
the @entity8 say radar could classify the turbines as a threat - automatically sending in fighter jets to investigate and allowing real enemies to sneak in			1
a wind turbine could interfere with the @entity8 radar system they say if approved the green energy devices , in @entity21 , would confuse computer systems designed to protect the @entity23 - and do n't want them put up			1
plans for the turbines have been submitted by @entity27 and @entity28 , who want to install the @entity30 towers on their neighbouring farms in @entity32 , @entity21			1
but their application prompted a written objection from the @entity8 which warned the installation would cause ' unacceptable interference ' to an air traffic control ( @entity39 ) radar 30 miles away in @entity40 , @entity41			1
radar operators have to treat any unidentified object as a genuine threat - and could even have to scramble fighter jets to investigate			2
their objection said : ' wind turbines have been shown to have detrimental effects on the performance of @entity39 radars			2
radar operators have to treat any unidentified object as a genuine threat - and could even have to scramble fighter jets to investigate the turbines ' these effects include the desensitisation of radar in the vicinity of the turbines , and the creation of ' false ' aircraft returns which air traffic controllers must treat as real			2
' the desensitisation of radar could result in aircraft not being detected by the radar and therefore not presented to air traffic controllers			2
' @entity8 chiefs said controllers relied upon accurate radar readings to distinguish between military and civilian aircraft			1
their letter added : ' the creation of " false " aircraft display on the radar leads to increased workload for both controllers and air crews and may have a significant operational impact			0
' furthermore , real aircraft returns can be obscured by the turbine 's radar returns , making the tracking of conflicting , unknown aircraft much more difficult			0
' the wind farm proposal has also provoked opposition from locals who say the towers will be a blot on the picturesque @entity21 landscape			1
@entity92 , who owns a smallholding near the proposed site , has collected signatures of 109 villagers calling on @entity97 to reject the plan			0
he said : ' the turbine will really be right on top of us			0
it 's so close that we are going to suffer from noise pollution			0
' but what 's more worrying is that there is a public safety issue with these turbines			0
' the @entity8 clearly says that operators can not assume that it 's just the wind turbine			1
they have to deal with it as if it was a real problem			0
' @entity97 is due to report back on the application by may 13			0
a spokeswoman said the council does not comment on undecided applications .			0
