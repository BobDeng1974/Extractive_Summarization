for a freeze - frame street performer who makes a living by standing very , very still , patience is more than just a virtue			0
but when a trouble - maker tried to put the silver cowboy off his act by tickling his ribs and putting a soggy finger in his ear , no amount of patience could keep him still ... so he punched him in the face			2
the incredible reaction was caught on camera on @entity20 shopping street in @entity22 's @entity21 today			1
he tweaked his nose , tickled his ribs , doffed his hat - and even licked his finger and thrust it in the entertainer 's ear			1
annoying : the performer had been innocently plying his trade , shaking hands with a young member of his audience when a blond and tattooed trouble maker attempted to put him off probing : he tweaked his nose , tickled his ribs , doffed his hat - and even licked his finger and thrust it in the entertainer 's ear that 's my hat : the man even tried to readjust the performer 's cowboy hat cool performance : as horrified shoppers looked on the cowboy returned to his pose and continued the act as if nothing had happened and still the thick - set performer held his composure			1
then the grinning passer by made one final attempt to distract his foe and rubbed his face with his hand			0
from nowhere , the moustachioed cowboy broke from his trance and lashed out , thumping the man in the jaw with his fist , knocking him to the ground			0
as horrified shoppers looked on the cowboy returned to his pose and continued the act as if nothing had happened .			0
