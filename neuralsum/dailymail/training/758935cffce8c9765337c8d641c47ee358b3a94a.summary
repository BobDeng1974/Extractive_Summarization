the robbers stormed the train and took all but seven of 128 highly - prized sacks			0
in today 's terms they made off with the equivalent of nearly £ 50million			2
following the robbery the gang , including ringleader @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity40 , retreated to a nearby farmhouse to hide from the police			1
while they were there they played the board game to pass the time using real money to buy the streets , houses and hotels			0
it proved to be their undoing			0
when the police turned up at the farmhouse , the 15 robbers made their escape , but in their haste they left the @entity2 set - with their fingerprints all over it			1
@entity86 : the robbers played this @entity2 set while they hid from police in a @entity50 farmhouse notorious : the late @entity62 pictured here at his flower stall in @entity92 in 1994 prints lifted from the game formed a major part of the evidence against the gang , helping to convict them			2
also recovered from the site were chequebooks , a driving licence , a diary and a real five pound note			0
the @entity2 set was saved from police archives and put on display at the private @entity31			1
experts from the @entity107 's @entity9 valued to monopoly it at £ 200			1
@entity109 , former curator at the museum , said : ' in 1963 a royal mail train was held up in @entity50 and £ 2.6million was stolen			2

while they were there they killed time by playing @entity2 , among other things			0
hideout : @entity119 in @entity50 , where the notorious gang laid low to escape the clutches of the police haul : the robbers made off with 171 bags stuffed full of cash , which they used to play @entity2 with			2
the set can be seen here among other evidence found at the farmhouse ' meanwhile the police had decided to search properties within a 25 - mile radius of where the robbery took place			2
' when the lair was eventually discovered police found the robbers had made a hasty getaway			1
' the farmhouse had been stocked full of food supplies and bedding by the robbers			0
