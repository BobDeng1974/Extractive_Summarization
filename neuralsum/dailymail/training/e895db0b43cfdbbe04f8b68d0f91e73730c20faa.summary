by @entity0 fat - fingered phone users rejoice ! a new kind of touchscreen text - entry software promises to improve typing accuracy while at the same time shrinking your keyboard			1
@entity7 condenses all the letters in the alphabet down to one line on your device 's screen to eliminate visual clutter , while using complex maths to increase accuracy			1
the team behind the app are seeking to fund the project through @entity20 , but its appeal has proved so great it has already nearly doubled its $ 10,000 goal - with 30 days left to go			1
compact : @entity7 condenses all the keys on a traditional keyboard down to one line at the bottom of your touchscreen device , leaving acres of precious space left to view apps described as ' the little keyboard for big fingers ' , @entity7 shrinks the usual three column layout of @entity37 keyboards down to one compact line at the bottom of the screen			1
existing mobile device keyboard software often takes up much of the screen , meaning that users can barely see the software they are typing on			2
the @entity45 team behind @entity7 say their software recovers more than half the usable touchscreen space taken up by traditional touchscreen keyboards			1
further , they say their special algorithm allows for faster test entry , even when your typing is sloppy , while still providing easy access to special keys like numbers , punctuation and backspace			2
innovative design : @entity7 earned its name from the way its keys are laid out in a row in what the developers call a ' continuum of letters ' and if that was not enough the app is so flexible the keyboard can even be moved around the screen allowing users to leave visible the bits of the display they are working on			1
' your typing on mobile devices is inherently imprecise — and there ’s nothing wrong with that			2
' say the developers on their @entity20 page			1
' by reducing the keyboard to a single dimension , @entity86 opens up your touchscreen space for a variety of interaction possibilities — which allows for precision - entry			0
' @entity7 earned its name from the way its keys are laid out in a row in what the developers call a ' continuum of letters '			1
' we call it ' one - dimensional ' because it ’s based on one row of keys , ' they say			0
' this frees up the keyboard to be anywhere you like on the screen , or even to curve for a more ergonomic keyboard shape			0
' the idea was inspired by a research project undertaken by some of the developers while studying at the @entity116 which asked them to invent a better way of typing on touchscreen phones without looking			2
from this project , they came up with the app 's novel alphabet layout and the disambiguation algorithm needed to ensure that it understood what users were trying to type in			2
but de-cluttering your touchscreen is only the short - term ambition of the @entity86 team			0
they envisage its revolutionary design being adapted to a range of surfaces			0
you need n't even have to use your fingers since any motion in one - dimension can be used to input information via @entity86			0
possibilities for the future : de-cluttering your touchscreen is only the short - term ambition of the @entity86 team			0
they envisage its revolutionary design being adapted to a range of surfaces that means that users with an accelerometer equipped game controller , like those on @entity154 's @entity153 console could swing it from side to side to input words ; and users wearing head - mounted computers like @entity161 could even write by pivoting their heads from side to side			0
' with only one dimension to measure , these kinds of typing systems are easy to make — and easy to use , even in noisy and constrained sensing environments , ' the @entity86 team say			0
the app is currently in development for @entity171 , since @entity173 's @entity172 does not allow users to replace the operating system 's built - in keyboard			0
the @entity86 team say they will use their first $ 10,000 to turn their prototype software into a fully - fledged @entity171 app ready to be distributed via @entity179 's play store .			1

@entity7 condenses all the letters of the alphabet down to one line
it also *includes* a complex algorithm to increase typing accuracy
developers have taken to @entity20 to crowd - *source* the funds they need
they have already nearly doubled their $ 10,000 goal , with 30 days left
