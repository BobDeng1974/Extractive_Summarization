by @entity0 girls as young as nine described their ideal woman as a ‘ pretty ’ blonde who dresses provocatively to attract men , according to shocking new research			1
a group of 13 - 14 year - olds revealed that she would wear ‘ tight ’ tops , expose her bra straps to get attention from men and have expensive clothes			1
asked to describe her , they used words such as a ' whore ' and ' slutty ' and said she would be promiscuous			2
more worryingly , an even younger group - aged between nine and 11 - said a woman should be ‘ interested in guys ’ and ‘ snobby ’			1
and when asked to draw their ideal woman , almost every girl from both groups produced a thin , blonde and white figure - even those children of non-white ethnicity			1
controversial : @entity27 has been criticised for being a poor role model for young girls due to her ' twerking ' antics during performances the findings came as researchers studied body image issues among young girls			1
professor @entity36 of the @entity37 asked two groups of girls aged nine to 11 and 13 - 14 to draw ‘ the ideal woman ’			1
the younger children unanimously depicted a blonde , blue - eyed girl with expensive clothes , high heels and ' tight ' clothes			2
the older girls drew a similar looking woman , describing her as promiscuous and stupid but physically attractive			2
presenting the research at an international conference on body image at the @entity51 in @entity52 , prof @entity36 said : ' what happens between the two groups is that the older girls start policing other women			2
' they want to look like that but say she is stupid			0
so they are demoting themselves with this ideal			0
they are even uncomfortable in their own ideals			0
their ideal woman was a double - edged sword			1
' she added : ' what we see is a constant failure to accept diversity , so we have a lot of work left to do			1
' other speakers at the conference noted the negative influences of social media on how young people viewed their body image			0
professor @entity79 of the @entity80 examined the effects of cyber bullying on teenagers by studying a group of 15 year - old girls and boys			1
the girls admitted they feared being criticised for their looks and strongly desired admiration from people online , even if they are strangers			0
@entity90 : according to the study , @entity91 , pictured here watching the ladies ' singles final at @entity94 , is not the type of woman young girls aspire to become prof @entity79 said : ' they are opening themselves up to such nasty comments , making themselves so vulnerable because they want so much to have someone post something complimentary or flattering			2
' it ’s worth the risk to them			0
' most girls admitted they were cruellest to other girls while teenage boys said they feared posting photographs of themselves online in case they were called ' gay ' by their peers			0
@entity115 , head of sexual abuse programmes at the @entity117 , said : ' what we see with studies like these is that children do n’t feel they can be themselves			1
' we ’ve noticed a significant increase in the number of children calling @entity126 and talking about the pressure they feel to look a certain way			0
' some of them say they do n’t want to be seen in public because they ’re too upset			0
it ’s really very worrying considering they ’re meant to be enjoying their childhoods .			0
