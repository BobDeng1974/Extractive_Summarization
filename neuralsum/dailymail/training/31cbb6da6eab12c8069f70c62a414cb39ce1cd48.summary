@entity1 fans hurled racist comments at a group protesting on behalf of black teenager @entity4 following a game on monday night , startling video has revealed			1
footage taken by @entity8 shows a large group of sports fans gathered outside @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 as protesters wave placards nearby			1
the protesters , all of whom appear to be black , were there to call for justice for @entity4 , the unarmed 18 - year - old who was shot dead by officer @entity21 in @entity22 on august 9			1
the groups clashed after monday 's game protest : the @entity22 protesters , pictured , yelled that the sports fans were looking at democracy - but the fans responded by telling them to get a job and pull up their pants			1
police officers did not intervene the man turns to the camera and says : ' that 's right ! if they 'd be working , we would n't have this problem ! ' as the protesters shout ' justice for @entity50 ' , the fans drown them out with cries of ' @entity52 ' which quickly become ' @entity54 ' - referring to the cop who killed the teenager			1
later in the video , a white woman yells at the protesters , ' we 're the ones who gave all y'all the freedoms that you have ! ' before other fans yell ' @entity64 ! ' and ' @entity65 ! @entity65 ! @entity65 ! ' soon after , another fan tells a protester to take off his hat and ' pull up your pants '			1
one protester even sticks a piece of paper to the back of his jersey reading : ' i am @entity21 '			2
still , the protesters refuse to give up , with one man telling the sports fans that they are watching democracy			0
the group continues to shout : ' we young , we strong , we marching all night long			0
' fight : a video shows the crowd drowning out the protesters ' cries with chants of ' @entity65 ! @entity65 ! @entity65 ! ' at one point , a woman confronted the man filming the video , @entity93 ' @entity91 , a @entity94			1
' why are you here ? ' she says			0
' i do n't believe you 're a veteran			0
what are you ? ' ' what do you mean what am i ? ' @entity91 says			0
' what race am i ? i 'm a f * * * ing @entity94			0
' ' ok - from what level ? how far did you get ? ' she asks , before walking away			0
@entity91 later spoke with the @entity104 about the video , and said not a single fan tried to have a rational conversation with the protesters			0
' that 's sad that it gives our city a really bad look , ' he said			0
' the sad part about it is the fans that were there , you have no idea if they came in for the playoff game from outside the @entity12 area			2
' it really portrays @entity12 as super racist ... but there 's no way to prove those fans were from here			1
' killed : officer @entity21 , left , shot dead 18 - year - old @entity4 in broad daylight on august 9 a grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer @entity21			1
in differing accounts , police have said @entity4 struggled with @entity21 , 28 , before the fatal shots were fired , but some witnesses say @entity4 held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest			2
if charges are not brought against @entity21 , police fear an outbreak of violence not just in the @entity12 suburb of @entity22 , but across the greater metropolitan area and even in other @entity65 cities , according to @entity145 police chief @entity144 and others involved in the planning meetings			2
police officers in @entity13 are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios , while also talking with other major police departments around the country .			0
