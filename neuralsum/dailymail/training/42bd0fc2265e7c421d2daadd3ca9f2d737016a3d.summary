by @entity0 one in four hip replacements may be unsafe , new research has found			1
researchers at @entity4 found that 24 per cent of all hip implants available to surgeons are not backed by evidence of safety or effectiveness			1
they also concluded that one in 12 devices that have been used on patients , or around eight per cent , were not backed by information that they were safe			0
metal on metal : patients with these hip replacements would need annual checks the researchers warned that the system for regulating hip implants ‘ seems to be entirely inadequate ’ , almost two years after a widespread scandal resulted in an alert being issued to the @entity24			1
in february last year , the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) announced almost 50,000 patients with ‘ metal on metal ’ hip replacements would need annual checks - including blood tests - over concerns they could cause serious health problems			1
those devices were linked to muscle and bone damage and neurological issues			0
tiny metal ions made up of cobalt and chromium were thought to break off from the implants and leak into the blood			0
today ’s research , published in the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , involved a review of all hip implants used in surgery in 2011 , taken from the @entity50 for @entity51 and @entity52			1
the team concluded : ‘ this systematic review of the literature shows that 8 per cent of primary hip replacement prostheses implanted in 2011 and recorded by the @entity50 had no readily available evidence relating to their safety or effectiveness			2
‘ this is likely to be an underestimation of the true problem , as much of the evidence that does exist for the other unrated prostheses is of low quality or relates to short - term outcomes only			0
‘ this is of great concern , particularly in light of the widespread publicity surrounding recent safety problems with regard to some resurfacing and other large diameter metal - on - metal joint replacements			0
’ research : @entity4 found that 24 per cent of all hip implants are not backed by evidence of safety an @entity25 spokesman stressed that most patients who have hip replacements are not at risk			1
‘ the majority of patients who receive hip implants have well - functioning hips and are at a low risk of developing any serious problems , ’ he said			2
‘ the @entity92 regulatory system for medical devices such as hip implants is currently being revised and the @entity25 has argued that there needs to be more stringent audits and clearer requirements relating to the consideration of clinical evidence			2
‘ we also want information on the performance of devices to be more transparent and freely available			0
‘ in addition , a new system called “ beyond compliance ” is being established that promotes the availability of short - to mid-term clinical data and strengthens the evidence base for new implants in a more transparent manner			0
‘ this should decrease the complication and the revision rates that may be associated with newly introduced hip implants , resulting in better patient care , better patient quality of life and decreased costs to the health services			2

@entity4 found 24 per cent of hip implants not backed by evidence
50,000 patients with ‘ metal on metal ’ hip replacements need annual checks
today ’s research involved all hip implants used in surgery in 2011
