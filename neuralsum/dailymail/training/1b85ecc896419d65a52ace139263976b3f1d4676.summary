by @entity0 with its boarded - up windows and faded whitewash walls , walkers could be forgiven for ignoring this decaying concrete building tucked away in the @entity7 hills			0
but @entity9 station , not far from @entity10 , @entity11 , was once the heartbeat of @entity14 's naval communications and played a vital role in many key military decisions			1
the centre was built during the @entity18 amid fears the @entity20 could bomb the @entity14 's main communications post at @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity24 near @entity10 , @entity11 was once the centre of @entity14 naval communications , beaming messages out to submarines and battleships around the world after it was abandoned at the end of the 1990s , the once - important building has since been left to rot and photos show the current state of its once - bustling halls radio devices which once sent out messages around the world have grown rusty while the building has been ignored and vandalised ( left )			1
three radio masts ( like that pictured , right ) which stood at the site were demolished in 2003 while @entity9 was still being tested , a fire knocked out the centre at @entity22 , making the @entity7 station @entity14 's foremost naval communications post , sending out orders to our huge fleet of submarines and battleships			1
the station was used in ordering the sinking of @entity20 battleship @entity52 in 1943 , seen as huge psychological blow for the @entity20 high command and the nation as a whole			2
but it was after the @entity18 that the station was at its busiest			0
it became the top - secret hub of @entity63 communications and 160 people worked at the site during the tense 1960s , as messages were beamed across the @entity68 during the @entity69			0
as the centre of communications with missile - launching submarines , it was feared the site would be one of the first @entity76 targets in the event of nuclear war and it soon saw protests by nuclear disarmament campaigners and activists			2
the centre remained key to @entity14 's naval communication right up until the end of the 1990s , but its three 700ft - high radio masts and three 600ft - high towers were demolished in 2003			1
eerie new pictures of the abandoned building have emerged ahead of plans to turn it into a war museum			1
in its heyday in the 1960s , the centre was the hub of communications with @entity14 's nuclear submarines and was believed to be a key target in the case of a @entity76 missile strike locals now want to turn the building into a war museum , celebrating the centre 's importance in many of @entity14 's 20th century conflicts the building is nearby ' @entity109 ' , a 1782 monument dedicated to naval hero vice-admiral sir @entity111 to commemorate the defeat of a @entity114 fleet in the @entity115 a panoramic view from beside @entity109			1
the abandoned @entity9 site lies in the shadow of this ' gateway to @entity7 ' landmark local councillor @entity121 , who is leading a campaign to revamp the decaying centre , said : ' you would not believe what went on in these buildings that were linked up to @entity127 and @entity128 in the @entity129			0
' it is believed @entity132 â€™s direct order to sink the @entity134 ship the @entity135 during the @entity136 was transmitted through @entity9			2
' the buildings have been left to decay over the past decade but we want to turn them into a museum exhibition which could have both historical and educational value			0
' the area 's naval traditions go back to the building of ' @entity109 ' on @entity145 , a mound created by underground volcanic activity			0
the 1782 monument which tops the hill is dedicated to naval hero vice-admiral sir @entity111 , to commemorate the defeat of a @entity114 fleet in the @entity115			0
four bidders are believed to have come forward to @entity9 's current owners @entity155 and the potential sale is expected to be completed by the end of june			0
orders to sink the @entity52 ( pictured left ) , a key @entity20 warship , during the @entity18 , were sent from the station			2
the centre was at it busiest around the time of the @entity69 , as @entity129 president @entity164 ( pictured right ) prepared for potential nuclear war on the other side of the @entity68 the centre is believed to have been used to route orders from prime minister @entity132 to sink the @entity134 cruiser @entity135 in 1982			1

@entity9 station became @entity14 's most important naval communications centre during the @entity18
used to direct the sinking of the @entity52 in @entity18 and the sinking of the @entity135 during @entity176
it was busiest during the @entity63 , when its messages to submarines made it a target for nuclear attack
the centre was abandoned at the end of the 1990s but locals now want to turn it into a war museum
