geranium plants could hold the key to a new generation of @entity5 treatments , research suggests			0
extracts of the geranium plant @entity7 inactivate @entity5 - 1 and prevent the virus invading human cells			1
@entity5 is divided into two types – @entity5 - 1 and @entity5 - 2			1
@entity5 - 1 is responsible for the majority of cases			2
a compound found in geranium plants can be used to treat @entity5 - 1 , the most common form of the virus researchers at the @entity19 , in @entity20 , say extracts from the geranium plants could represent a potential new class of @entity25 - 1 drugs for the treatment of @entity27			1
they found that root extracts from the plants contain a compound that attacks @entity5 - 1 and prevents the virus replicating inside the human body			1
they found it also protects blood and immune cells from infection by the virus			0
it blocks the attachment of @entity5 particles to human cells and , thus , effectively prevents the virus invading the cells			1
several clinical trials have already demonstrated that the geranium extracts are safe for human use and in @entity47 they are already licenced for use as a herbal medicine			0
research group leader professor @entity50 said : ‘ [ @entity51 ] extracts are a very promising lead for the development of the first scientifically validated phytomedicine against @entity5 - 1			2
‘ [ the ] extracts attack @entity5 - 1 with a mode of action that is different from all anti-hiv - 1 drugs in clinical use			2
‘ therefore [ they ] may be a valuable supplement for established @entity25 therapies			0
the plant extract prevents the virus invading human cells and replicating inside the human body ‘ furthermore , [ the ] extracts are attractive candidates for increasing anti-hiv - 1 therapy options in resource - limited settings , since they are easy to produce and do not require refrigeration			1
‘ the results of our study and the proven safety of [ the ] extracts encourages their testing in @entity5 - 1 infected individuals as a next step			2
’ according to the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , more than 35 million people in the world are infected with @entity5 , the majority with @entity5 - 1			0
without treatment , @entity5 destroys the immune system and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( @entity27 ) , which is a life - threatening disease			0
@entity5 / @entity27 is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide .			0

the root extract can help treat @entity5 - 1 , the most common form of the virus
it contains a compound which prevents the virus replicating in the body
it blocks the attachment of @entity5 particles to human cells effectively preventing the virus invading cells
