by @entity0 published : 10:06 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 9 august 2013 students from @entity2 and @entity3 have developed an amphibious prosthetic limb that lets wearers run on sand and swim full speed in the sea			2
the @entity9 has a split - toe design that helps a user balance on the uneven terrain of a beach and has studs that give a larger surface area when running on soft sand			1
when worn in water , @entity17 has ' fins ' fitted at the top of the prosthesis that channel the flow of water along the limb and propels the swimmer faster - and this can give wearers more thrust and faster speeds than able - bodied people			1
the limb also comes with ' fins ' that mean the wearer can transition to swimming easily the split - toe foot with studs provide a larger surface area that improves balance on soft and uneven terrains			1
the split - toe also reduces the amount of drag in water			1
it has a carbon - fibre backbone that supports the wearer 's body weight but is flexible and creates energy during running and walking			0
fins along the front of the prosthesis give thrust when kicking and channel water past the foot to streamline movement in water			0
the team behind @entity17 wanted to create a prosthesis specifically designed for high - performance water sports and beach activities such as surfing and beach volleyball			1
it has a carbon - fibre backbone that supports the wearer 's body weight but is flexible and creates energy during running and walking			0
pairs of fins along the front of the prosthesis give thrust when kicking			0
they also channel water past the foot to streamline the movement and reduce underwater drag			0
the split - toe foot with studs provide a larger surface area that improves balance on soft and moving terrains			2
@entity17 , right , is made of carbon fibre and has fins that give thrust when kicking			2
these fins , inspired by the fins on a sailfish , also channel water past the foot in water to give wearer 's ' superhuman ' speed			2
its split - toe foot with studs give a larger surface area that improves balance on uneven terrains such as sand , right @entity17 lets the wearer seamlessly switch from running on the beach to swimming at full speed the fins of the @entity17 were inspired by the dorsal fin of the sailfish , which is capable of swimming 100 metres in under five seconds			1
the split - toe also reduces the amount of drag in water			1
because of its design and the material it is made for , the limb lets the wearer go seamlessly from running on the beach to swimming at full speed			0
the makers even claim that this specialised design could make wearers swim faster than able - bodied people			1
in a demonstration video , one of the developers claims he wanted to give the wearer a ' superpower ' with the design of @entity17			0
the limb has been made to be lightweight and durable and could also be used daily on other terrains and during other sports			0
according to the @entity130 , the design is just a prototype and there are no immediate plans to sell it commercially .			0

@entity17 was designed for high - performance water and beach activities
its split - toe design makes it easier for wearers to run on sand
fins also propel swimmers through water faster than able - bodied people
design was inspired by the fins of the world 's fastest fish , the sailfish
