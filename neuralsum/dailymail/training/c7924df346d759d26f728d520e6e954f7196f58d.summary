the daughter of @entity2 ceo @entity1 has come under fire for an article in which she branded the poor city of @entity6 , @entity8 ' apocalyptic ' - and used a photo of @entity10 as proof			1
@entity12 , 26 , from @entity13 , penned the piece for @entity15 and detailed the town 's crime and unemployment stats , sweeping over the number of residents her father 's bank foreclosed on			1
' @entity6 now drowns in the hell that has become much of @entity25 's @entity24 , ' @entity1 wrote of @entity6 , which was the birthplace of @entity26			1
but after the article - ' this is @entity25 's @entity30 , @entity31 - and you 've probably never heard of it ' - was published , it emerged that some of the photos of @entity6 were actually of other places			1
under fire : @entity12 , the daughter of beleaguered @entity2 boss @entity1 , has written an article about @entity6 , @entity8 that has sparked anger for its focus and inaccuracies a @entity43 thread hitting back at the article first pointed out that the pictures were not all accurate			1
' i thought i was hallucinating at first , but this picture is not actually from @entity6 , ' one user wrote , the @entity46 reported			2
' i know this because i lived in the place pictured almost my entire life			0
' it 's a city in @entity10 called @entity54			2
i 'm really confused as to why this picture is featured in the article and i 'm a little creeped out			0
' a @entity59 street map view shows that the photograph in the article matches the street in @entity54			0
another photograph that actually pictured @entity64 was also removed amid the backlash			2
as @entity1 was criticized , she admitted that she has never been to @entity6			1
oops : the article initially featured an image of @entity54 in central @entity10 but it has since been removed spotted : a @entity59 map street view shows the same road in @entity54 that featured in the article after the photos were taken down , the website added an explanation that the article had also been re-headlined to : ' this is one of @entity25 's most violent cities - and it deserves more attention '			1
' we believe the correction better befits the intent of our writer , ' the editors wrote , ' and we continue to stand by the story			0
' deadline @entity64 noted that @entity15 is similar to websites like @entity88 that use a ' a behavioral analyst ' to generate viral headlines before assigning them to a writer to produce a matching story			2
' that cart - before - horse reversal - " do a clip job on @entity6 as @entity25 's most apocalyptic , violent city " - is not how things typically work at new media or those with print roots , ' writer @entity94 wrote			1
' but while traditional editorial practices may point the way to an ethical high road , they 're not necessarily the route to a high - traffic path in journalism 's reshaped landscape			0
' corrections : the editors also changed the name of the article - after realizing @entity6 was in fact a well known place @entity116 also attacked @entity1 's assumption that @entity6 - the home of @entity26 and a feature of documentaries by @entity120 , who grew up there - was unknown			1
and after being slammed for her article , @entity1 gave a surprising reaction on her @entity124 account			2
' @entity126 piece is in serious consideration , ' she wrote			0
' wow , what a vocal and proud city			0
thanks to all for the responses			0
' it is not the first time @entity1 , a @entity131 and @entity132 graduate , has come under fire this month - after she , her siblings and parents sent out a @entity137 card featuring them hitting tennis balls around their luxurious home			2
spin : after the backlash from readers online , @entity1 said she was impressed with the ' vocal and proud city ' troubled : she is the daughter of @entity1 , the millionaire chairman and ceo of @entity2 @entity1 , 57 , was branded ' tone deaf ' after sending the decadent card to employees at @entity2			1
critics said that the card was tasteless in a time of economic hardship as @entity1 earns $ 18.7m a year , making him one of the best compensated bosses in @entity25			0
@entity155 host @entity154 said it was as if the @entity1 family were saying : ‘ hey , we ’re so rich we can destroy our own stuff ’ , whilst the @entity161 magazine said it was ‘ braggy and opulent ’			0
in october @entity2 agreed a $ 13billion deal with the @entity25 government to end investigations into its selling of mortgage investments in the 2008 financial crisis .			0
