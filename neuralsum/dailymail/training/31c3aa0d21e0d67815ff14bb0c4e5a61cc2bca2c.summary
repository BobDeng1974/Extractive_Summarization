@entity1 's stars were put through a gruelling training session by @entity3 and his staff , ahead of their title showdown against @entity6 on saturday evening			1
@entity3 's side are currently four points behind the leaders and they know that a win will not only close the gap but will make the consecutive 2 - 0 home defeats by @entity13 and @entity14 a distant memory			0
@entity16 and new signing @entity17 could be involved in the clash , if the @entity20 are knocked out of the @entity21 tonight , and that would be a huge boost for the @entity25 's reigning champions			2
the two sides managed a 1 - 1 draw earlier in the season at the @entity60 when @entity61 star @entity37 scored a vital late equaliser for home side , after @entity64 had put the visitors ahead			0
potentially some good news for @entity45 and his teammates is the news that @entity68 could face a three - match ban after being involved in a number of incidents against @entity72 last night			0

@entity6 are also sweating on the fitness of @entity102 after he was taken off complaining of a tight hamstring			0
but there can be no excuses this time round if the @entity106 fail to get a result against @entity53 's depleted side and close the gap on the league leaders			2
city players stretch before the start of their gruelling training session and @entity114 ( right ) calls out for the ball @entity116 was replaced in goal by @entity118 at the weekend but he is set to regain his place for the visit to @entity6 @entity121 backs @entity122 ( centre ) and @entity124 ( right ) compete for the ball during today 's training session @entity1 's stars lead by @entity78 ( left ) , @entity124 ( centre ) and @entity34 ( right ) take a light jog around one of the training pitches			1
