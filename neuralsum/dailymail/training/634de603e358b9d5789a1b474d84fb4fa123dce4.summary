the number of calories in @entity3 's burgers and fries will soon be listed on menus across the country , whether customers want to see them or not			1
the world 's biggest hamburger chain is announcing today that it will post calorie information on restaurant and drive - thru menus nationwide starting on monday			1
the move comes ahead of a regulation that will require major chains to post the information as early as next year			1
' we want to voluntarily do this , ' said @entity20 , president of @entity21			0
' we believe it will help educate customers			0
' calorie counting : a @entity3 's menu in @entity25 is seen ahead of a change to the @entity28 ' 14,000 restaurants that will show their menus ' calorie content in cities such as @entity25 and @entity33 where posting calorie information is already required , however , @entity20 notes that the information has not changed what customers choose to order			1
calorie average for @entity3 's 20 listed burgers : 501 sodium average for @entity3 's 20 listed burgers : 44 % of daily value * * per cent daily values ( @entity42 ) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet			1
' when it 's all said and done , the menu mix does n't change , ' she said			2
' but i do think people feel better knowing this information			0
' according to the numbers already published on their website , their 20 listed sandwiches , excluding their @entity51 , average out to 501 calories each			1
the highest sandwich for calorie content is their @entity57 & cheese clocking in 790 calories and 2,070mg of sodium - or 86 % of one ’s daily value , @entity42 , based on a 2,000 calorie diet			1
the second runner up is their @entity66 & @entity68 , at 770 calories and 1,170mg ( 49 % @entity42 ) of sodium , and third , their @entity70 at 750 calories and 1,700 ( 71 % @entity42 ) of sodium			2
all 20 sandwiches listed average out to 44 per cent of one ’s suggested daily value			2
the @entity77 , @entity78 , - based company is also testing healthier options for next year , such as an @entity80 made with egg whites and a whole grain muffin			2
beef cake : @entity84 & cheese burger is their highest calorie sandwich listed on their menu racking in 790 calories , 62g of fat and 1,360mg of sodium silver and bronze : the @entity93 & @entity68 ( left ) clocks in at 770 calories , 40g of fat and 1,170mg of sodium , while the @entity70 ( right ) , has 750 calories , 39g of fat and 1,700mg of sodium the sandwich has @entity100 bacon and white cheddar cheese and clocks in at 260 calories			1
it will be called the @entity104			0
the chain is also testing versions of the @entity107 , which is a bigger version of its @entity109 that is already sold in @entity110			0
the wraps have sliced cucumbers and are less than 350 calories			0
the posting of calorie information is n't a magic bullet in fighting obesity but could have a big effect over time , says @entity119 , director of nutrition at the @entity121 , which advocates on nutrition and food safety issues			2
' obesity is n't the kind of thing where one day you wake up and you 're fat			0
we gradually and slowly gain weight over time , ' she said			0
so even if only some people are swayed to make slightly better choices , @entity119 thinks there 's a big benefit to providing calorie information			2
another upside is that companies tend to work harder to provide healthier options when they 're forced to display calorie information			0
hearty meal : a @entity3 's meal featuring a popular @entity143 sandwich , medium fries , and a medium @entity146 charms it consumer with a total of 1,140 calories ' it can be embarrassing , or shocking , so they end up changing the way the product is made , ' @entity119 said			1
breakfast : @entity155 : @entity156 : @entity157 : desert : the moves also reflect the pressures @entity3 's and other fast - food chains are facing amid growing concerns about obesity			1
@entity3 's is also facing competition from chains such as @entity165 , which positions itself as a healthy alternative to traditional hamburger chains			1
@entity3 's notes that it has already made strides in improving the nutrition of its food , such as the automatic inclusion of apple slices in its happy meals			1
and this summer , @entity3 's rolled out a ' favorites under 400 ' campaign that highlighted the menu items that had fewer than 400 calories			1
the company noted that about 80 percent of its menu items fit the bill			0
of course , not everyone orders just one item			0
and the chain has been blamed by critics for fueling obesity rates with its big soft drinks and other items			0
a meal consisting of a @entity143 and medium fries , for example , has 930 calories			0
add a 16 - ounce @entity146 , and the count rises to 1,080 calories			0
the decision to post calorie information follows the @entity200 's decision this summer to uphold president @entity202 's health care overhaul , which requires restaurant chains with more than 20 locations to post calorie information			2
the timing of carrying out that requirement has yet to be worked out			0
@entity3 's , which has 14,000 locations in the @entity28 , does n't plan to advertise the posting of the calorie information			1
@entity20 said it 's something the chain is doing as a ' customer convenience			2

the world 's biggest hamburger chain is posting calories ahead of a @entity28 regulation that starts early next year
@entity3 's most calorific burger is their @entity222 with 790
calorie average for chain 's 20 burgers listed on their website is 501
