an otherwise dull congressional hearing heated up briefly on friday , as a @entity2 congressman told the top @entity9 ' preparedness ' official she should quit , before ranting about the chance of contracting @entity5 from a dirty airplane – and then abruptly leaving to catch a flight			1
the @entity10 heard testimony from a panel that included @entity9 assistant secretary for preparedness and response @entity13 , two @entity15 officials and the @entity17 's inspector general			1
@entity13 gamely kept a straight face			0
' they might have barfed on the plane ! ' dr. @entity13 , the @entity9 assistant secretary for preparedness and response , sat puzzled while the congressman leapt from topic to topic and wondered aloud about who 's in charge ' these people are coming by planes , ' said @entity34 rep. @entity23 of @entity35			1
' when some plane comes in from @entity37 , or transits through and has passengers from there , what are we doing with it ? the plane ? ' ' with the plane itself ? ' a puzzled @entity13 asked			2
' yeah , the plane ! they 've been on the plane , ' snapped @entity23			2
' they might have barfed on the plane , there might be excrement , there may be vomit , there may be body fluids			1
' ' there are protocols for cleaning the plane , ' offered @entity13			2
the @entity57 insists that @entity5 is transmitted only through contact with bodily fluids			2
in some cases , however , the deadly contagion can remain alive on inert surfaces for a period of minutes			0
@entity23 explained that his concerns stemmed from a global avian influenza crisis nearly a decade ago			2
' i want to know the protocols are there in place ! i 've seen the equipment that we have , and the @entity57 actually got some of them , ' he told @entity13			2
' it 's a heating device that heats the plane to 140 degrees to kill the germs , and that 's what we used in the bird flu			1
are we doing anything like that to make sure those planes are n't little @entity5 transporters ? ' after a brief pause , @entity13 shifted gears			1
' mr. @entity23 , you sound upset , and i 'm sorry for that , ' she said			0
' but we will make sure you get the protocols for cleaning the plane			0
' ' i 'm not upset ! ' @entity23 insisted			2
' i 'm a happy boy			0
' forget about screening the passengers : what about the planes ? @entity23 flipped out at the idea that the ebola virus could hop from a person to an airplane or lavatory seat and then onto another passenger @entity13 had told the committee in her opening statement that ' @entity5 is a dangerous disease , but there is hardly a reason for panic			1
there is an epidemic of fear , but not of @entity5 , in the @entity106			1
' ' " this is n't a panic			0
it 's to be prepared " , ' @entity23 parroted back to her			1
@entity111 , 1959 when @entity35 @entity34 rep. @entity23 referred to ' @entity112 ' as ' @entity114 's marching song , ' his unique choice of words pointed to a 1953 song by humorist @entity111 ( video below ) about how a scout can fulfill his motto by carrying condoms and hiding his marijuana stash : keep those reefers hidden where you 're sure that they will not be found / and be careful not to smoke them when the scoutmaster 's around , for he only will insist that they be shared			1
be prepared ! --- if you 're looking for adventure of a new and different kind / and you come across a @entity132 who is similarly inclined , do n't be nervous , do n't be flustered , do n't be scared			0
be prepared ! grabbing a copy of a @entity17 inspector general report that found stockpiles of equipment and medicines that could be helpful in fighting @entity5 had been allowed to expire or fall into disrepair , he fixed his gaze on @entity13			1
' now , are you in charge of being prepared ? ' he asked			0
' i am in charge of being prepared , ' @entity13 repied			2
' okay , then i think you need to turn your resignation in			0
have you read this report ? have you read this report about preparedness that the @entity149 – do you have some authority over preparedness ? ' @entity13 told him that as an @entity9 official , she has no authority to oversee disease preparedness measures undertaken by another cabinet agency			1
' then you do n't have the authority to do the job ? ' a near - manic @entity23 sputtered			0
' who has the authority to do the job ? ... is that your job or somebody else 's ? ' ' you told me you 're responsible for preparedness , ' he shouted minutes later			0
' now if that 's not your responsibility , is it the new guy 's ? ' @entity23 was referring to @entity168 ebola response coordinator @entity167 , and made his point with a colorful reference to a 1950s song by humorist @entity111 about a @entity114 packing condoms and hiding his marijuana			1
' does he have the ability to go in and make certain that we are prepared ? it has n't hit here yet			0
but what you want to do is be prepared ' – ' " the @entity114 's marching song , @entity112 " , ' he said			1
@entity13 managed to crack only a single momentary smile			0
as he finished his interrogation , @entity23 got up to leave while the hearing continued			1
' i have a plane to catch , ' a room microphone picked him up saying			0
' have a safe flight , ' offered committee chair rep. @entity187 , a @entity188 @entity34			0
' it 'll be about your twelfth in four days			0

a rambling @entity2 rep. @entity23 *ripped* into @entity9 assistant secretary for preparedness and response @entity13 during an @entity5 hearing
' are you in charge of being prepared ? ' @entity23 demanded , dropping references to a 1950s parody song about ' the @entity114 's marching song '
he insisted on knowing if the @entity106 has a plan in place to sterilize airplanes like it had during the global bird flu panic
ebola *sufferers* ' might have barfed on the plane , there might be excrement , there may be vomit , there may be body fluids , ' he said
after a *breathless* torrent of questions , @entity23 got up to go while the hearing continued , saying ' i have a plane to catch '
