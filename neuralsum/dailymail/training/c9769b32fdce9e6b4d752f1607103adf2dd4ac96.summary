by @entity1 reporter published : 00:43 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 03:48 est , 15 july 2013 @entity2 has responded to the growing controversy over racist and homophobic statements made by several ' @entity6 ' contestants that were captured on the reality show 's live @entity9 feed			1
every program now comes with a written warning from the network			2
@entity2 had already distanced itself by making a statement about the prejudicial views being expressed by certain big brother @entity16 in its webcast by issuing a statement , but now on its main highlights program an advisory was shown on last nights episode			1
disclaimer : @entity2 big brother 15 placed a warning before the show for the first time in its history ' @entity6 ' is a reality show about group of people who have no privacy 24/7			1
at times , the houseguests reveal prejudices and other beliefs that @entity2 does not condone			1
we certainly find the statements made by several of the @entity16 on the live @entity9 feed to be offensive			2
views or opinions expressed by a @entity16 either on any live feed from the @entity41 or during the broadcast , are those of the individuals speaking and do not represent the views or opinions of @entity2 or the producers of the program			1
' over the years , tv viewers have long become used to seeing content disclaimers for violence , profanity and nudity , but @entity6 had never had such a warning for racial prejudice			1
the 15th season of @entity6 has shown more than one houseguest making racist comments to other contestants on the show			1
some have criticized the program for including such content , yet the show ’s viewership has climbed in the wake of the controversy			2
after thursday 's eviction episode , @entity78 targeted fellow housemate @entity80 by flipping over her mattress			2
after warning her not to flip her mattress again , @entity78 responded back in a ' black ' accent mocking the @entity83			0
' whatchu gon ' do gurl ... whatchu gon ' do ? class girl			0
where 's yo class ? ' @entity70 mocked			1
and not to be outdone by her friend , @entity89 piped in with more racism			0
as @entity80 was getting worked up , @entity89 confronted her saying : ' you want the black to come out ? ' earlier in the month , the ' @entity6 ' live feeds captured season 15 contestants @entity78 and @entity89 making racist and homophobic comments about their competitors			1
' dude , shut up , go make some rice , ' @entity70 said about @entity100 , an @entity101 - @entity74 contestant			0
later , @entity89 added , ' @entity102 was like , ' i 'm gon na punch her in the face , ' and i was like , ' maybe that 'll make her eyes straight			0
'' speaking about @entity108 and @entity80 , two @entity74 - @entity74 contestants , the duo said : ' blacks stick together ... they 're like tokens ... they 're like black @entity114 and @entity115			1
' the duo also said @entity108 and @entity80 's ' blackness ' was starting to come out			2
since the comments were made , it has been revealed that @entity78 has been dropped by her @entity122 , @entity121 - based modeling agency @entity120			1
shortly after the incident , the live feeds captured ' @entity6 ' producers making an announcement on the house pa system warning contestants not to use racial slurs against other housemates			1
' you want the black to come out ? ' @entity89 , left , threatened @entity80 , right former ' @entity6 ' contestant @entity133 has written an open letter to @entity2 calling on the network to air the racist statements on the show 's @entity2 broadcast , to give viewers an accurate representation of their character			1
' @entity89 , @entity70 , and @entity142 referred to historically marginalized players as ‘ tokens , ’ ' @entity133 wrote			0
' sadly , they are n’t too far off in their assessment			0
characters like @entity102 ( @entity149 ) , @entity80 , @entity108 ( @entity150 ) , and @entity100 are reduced to mere tokens when production fails to include micro-aggressions that they have to endure on a day - to - day basis			0
what ’s the point of casting racial , ethnic , and sexual minorities if production ’s going to edit out the racism , ethnic discrimination , and homophobia that these people encounter inside the house ? ' race war : @entity80 had to be physically removed from the room by housemate @entity167 @entity168 - who is also black - had to physically remove @entity80 from the room to stop the fight from escalating			0
both @entity89 and @entity70 drew criticism earlier this week when @entity2 aired some of their racist comments originally seen only by subscribers on the internet - only live feed			1
after contestant @entity167 told his fellow housemates ’ of the ladies remarks , calling them comments that ‘ you ca n’t apologize for , ’ the network went to the videotape			2
awful : a contestant can be heard off - camera mocking an @entity101 housemate @entity78 is shown mocking @entity101 house guest @entity100 , saying ‘ shutup , go make some rice , ’ while mocking nail salon workers			0
@entity189 then chimed in ‘ @entity102 was like , ' i 'm gon na punch her in the face , ' and i was like , '' maybe that 'll make her eyes straight			0
’ soon after , the dynamic duo moved on to deriding african - americans			0
digging the hole deeper , @entity189 said fellow contestant @entity80 ‘ is on the dark side , but she 's already dark , ’ with @entity78 adding ‘ be careful what you say in the dark because you might not be able to see the b --- -			2
’ hateful : another housemate can he heard joining in on the racism , the remarks were aired sunday night by @entity2 fired : @entity78 and @entity189 were fired after their employers became aware of their hateful comments on the show not to be outdone , @entity78 then called gay housemate @entity149 a ‘ queer			1
’ ‘ @entity217 , that ’s rude ! ’ said a fellow contest seeing the slurs for the first time			0
' even when these comments are made in fun , they still hurt and are disrespectful , especially when that person is n't there to hear it and back themselves up , ’ the @entity150 told the cameras			2
‘ it could privvy me to losing my temper , but that 's a no - no. i have to keep my eyes down the field for the bigger prize			2
though not aired on sunday night , @entity232 was also heard slamming gays and praising @entity234			1
' [ @entity78 ] makes comments that are completely inappropriate , where she makes fun of other people for what they look like and their ethnicity , and i think that 's going to hurt her -- a lot -- in the game and outside the game , ' contestant @entity244 opined			2
terrible : @entity232 's praise of @entity234 and homophobic slurs may have cost him his job with railroad operator @entity249 fallout from the ranting was swift			1
@entity78 , a 22 - year - old student and sometimes model , was dropped from her talent agency			0
' we certainly find the statements made by @entity70 on the live @entity9 feed to be offensive , ’ @entity254 said in a statement on its @entity260 page , adding that ‘ upon much consideration , we have decided to release @entity70 from her contract … ’ @entity189 , a pageant director for @entity264 @entity263 , was also fired			0
' we are actually thankful that this show let us see @entity89 for who she truly is , ’ a spokesperson said , ‘ we would never want her to be a role model to our future contestants			0
' currently on unpaid leave from @entity249 while participating in the show , @entity232 has also found himself in hot water			0
‘ the values represented by @entity232 's comments during the ' @entity6 ' show do not at all align with @entity249 's values , ’ said a statement on the railroad operator 's site			1
‘ @entity249 does not condone his comments			0
@entity249 is acting in accordance with collective bargaining agreement terms regarding mr. @entity232			0
