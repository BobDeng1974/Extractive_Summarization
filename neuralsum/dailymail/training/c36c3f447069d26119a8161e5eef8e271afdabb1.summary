not only did @entity6 pick up an injury there on friday , @entity5 and @entity4 succumbed to the curse on saturday			1
@entity6 had a session of treatment on his thigh on sunday morning but was subsequently declared unfit			1
@entity6 trains on friday but later suffered an injury which forced him out of sunday 's match @entity5 ( left ) was among those training at @entity0 on friday ahead of the match against @entity17 do your job there will be much talk about the logic of @entity23 marking the much taller @entity24 for @entity17 ’s goal and rightly so			1
@entity26 would have cleared @entity24 ’s header , though , had been standing tight to the front post as he was supposed to be			0
instead , the @entity3 striker got sucked towards the ball and that was all @entity24 needed to give @entity17 the lead			2
luckily for @entity33 , he was able to redeem itself			0
@entity24 rises high in the box to score @entity17 's opening goal against @entity3 at @entity37 fergie time the @entity3 match programme was pushing sales of sir @entity42 ’s reissued autobiography with what appeared to be little more than a free advert for the great man ’s book			1
we await any reference by @entity3 to the recent autobiography published by former @entity37 captain @entity50			2
sir @entity42 ( centre ) watches the @entity53 match between @entity3 and @entity54 last month best memories still with the match programme , how about this for a piece of nostalgia from the @entity60 era ? writing a postcard to his parents from a @entity3 tour of @entity65 in 1964 , 17 - year - old @entity60 tells them : ' the weather is brilliant , the food is not too good and the girls are fabulous			0

the scene at @entity85 earlier on sunday morning as supporters try to travel to @entity87 @entity88 @entity24 ’s record against @entity3 is actually quite modest			1
just four goals in 22 games			2
however he does score important goals against them , having previously won @entity17 an fa cup final and scoring a goal here in april 2010 that effectively won @entity17 the title			0
@entity24 celebrates after putting @entity17 ahead against @entity3 in sunday 's @entity53 clash @entity100 has his say @entity3 showed impressive resilience to claim a late point , and their never - say - die attitude clearly made an impression on @entity106 , who tweeted after the match : ‘ i do n’t think @entity3 are a million miles away and will qualify for next season ’s @entity108			1
’ the point keeps @entity112 ’s side in eighth position in the @entity53 table			0
