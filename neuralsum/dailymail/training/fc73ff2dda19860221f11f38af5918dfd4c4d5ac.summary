it is the handgun of choice for the good guys in countless @entity4 movies , from @entity5 to @entity6			0
now the @entity7 has been chosen by the @entity8 to replace the trusty old @entity9 - era @entity12 pistol after almost 50 years			1
more than 25,000 are being purchased for @entity14 ’s @entity13 under a £ 9million contract			1
kitted out : the @entity8 has purchased 25,000 @entity17 9mm handguns to be used by troops testing : @entity20 sergeant @entity19 tests a @entity17 9mm pistol			1
the gun has become the first new sidearm to be issued to @entity14 troops since 1967 first choice : the @entity8 undertook rigorous testing before choosing the new firearm , firing 40,000 over the testing period it is the first time since 1967 - before the @entity30 - that @entity14 troops have been issued with a new sidearm			1
defence chiefs say the @entity34 - made @entity17 gen 4 is lighter , carries more bullets , fires more quickly and accurately , and is safer to handle than the @entity12			1
while the replacement was not ordered in response to any specific threat , military commanders are clear that it will make it easier for troops in @entity42 to respond to ‘ green on blue ’ attacks			2
replacement : a @entity17 9mm pistol , top , and its predecessor , a @entity12 9mm , below			1
the @entity8 said the @entity12 was becoming too expensive to maintain on monday , @entity51 @entity50 , 23 , became the 24th @entity14 serviceman shot dead by an @entity42 army or police turncoat			1
the @entity7 takes less than a second to draw and fire , compared to the @entity12 which even for an expert often takes four or five seconds to remove from its holster , load the chamber and shoot			1
colonel @entity61 , head of the light weapons team at the @entity64 organisation , said : ‘ it wo n’t specifically address that [ green on blue attacks ] but overall it does improve the ability of guys to shoot back			0
’ sergeant @entity19 , 35 , a @entity20 based at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , said : ‘ if i can pick it up quicker , the faster i can shoot			0
‘ the faster i can shoot , the more chance i have of winning a fight			0
’ the @entity76 will be delivered within weeks and troops deployed to @entity42 will be among the first to carry them			2
the @entity8 began searching for a new sidearm in 2010 because the @entity12 was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain			1
col @entity61 said : ‘ it ’s like a car			0
there is a point where it becomes more effective to buy a new model rather than continue to maintain the old one			2
’ he said that pistols were also increasingly useful during counter-insurgency operations , such as in @entity89 , where soldiers mingle among the population			0
lightweight : the @entity17 is made from plastic and weighs 650g , around two - thirds of the @entity12 efficient : defence chiefs say the @entity34 - made @entity17 gen 4 is lighter , carries more bullets , fires more quickly and accurately , and is safer to handle than the @entity12 ‘ in the 1970s and 1980s the infantry was trained for long - range engagements with the enemy , ’ he said			1
‘ since @entity104 , the role has changed			0
now it is much more about compound clearance , getting closer to where the threat and enemy is			0
’ defence chiefs conducted extensive laboratory tests and field trials in jungle , desert and @entity117 environments , firing 40,000 rounds before choosing the @entity7			1
made of plastic instead of metal , the gun weighs 650g - around two - thirds of the @entity12			1
it is semi-automatic allowing a large number of rounds to be fired off quickly			1
each magazine carries up to 33 9mm bullets , compared to 13 in the @entity12			1
it also has three safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge , including a ‘ mini-trigger ’ built into the main trigger so it is unlikely to fire if pressed unintentionally			0
‘ you can drop it on the floor and it wo n’t go off , or kick it around and it wo n’t go off , ’ said col warden			0
the @entity7 was designed in 1982 by @entity34 radiator factory manager @entity141 , responding to a tender put out by the country ’s military			2
the firearm was first introduced to police in the @entity147 after they found themselves outgunned by violent criminal gangs			0
it is now used by two - thirds of all @entity147 police departments , including the specialist @entity154 and @entity153			0
glocks are also issued by the @entity156 of the @entity157 and the @entity158			0
the pistol has featured in @entity161 blockbusters including @entity162 , the @entity163 and @entity164 and numerous tv shows , such as @entity166 and the wire			0
but the @entity7 has also made headlines for more sombre reasons @entity172 far - right extremist @entity170 used one to kill most of the 67 people he shot dead during his massacre in @entity172 in july 2011			2
and @entity175 , used a @entity7 to shoot @entity147 senator @entity176 and kill six others in a grocery store shootings in @entity179 , @entity180 , in january 2011			2
