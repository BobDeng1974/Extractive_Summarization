by @entity0 @entity2 will turn down requests from mps , celebrities and public figures to get embarrassing material about themselves removed from search results , it was claimed today			1
@entity11 's top court ruled last month that people have the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the web , which led to the company being bombarded with requests			1
@entity2 has already had 50,000 requests to remove data and started to take down search results last week			1
technology giant : @entity2 has already had 50,000 requests to remove data and started to take down search results last week			1
the company 's headquarters in @entity26 , @entity27 , are pictured but it does not believe the @entity30 ruling covers public figures who want to have potentially damaging material removed , reported @entity34 of @entity35			1
searches for people ’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘ may have been removed under data protection law in @entity11 ’			2
this warning appears on all results , regardless of the name that has been searched for , and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted			2
last month ’s decision , which affects 500million people , requires search services to remove items deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' - and failure to do so can result in fines			2
going online : searches for people 's names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ' may have been removed under data protection law in @entity11 ' a @entity62 investigation in may uncovered that a misbehaving politician seeking re-election was among a flood of people who contacted @entity2 demanding their internet histories are deleted			1
under the @entity70 , @entity69 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			0
under @entity69 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			0
the @entity94 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data ’			0
the @entity98 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			0
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
in addition , it is believed that an actor has asked for details of an affair with a teenager to be removed			0
both requests are expected to be refused , according to @entity35			0
complaints over @entity2 ’s interpretation of the court ruling could be taken to the @entity117 , but lawyers believe famous people may not want to fight a high - profile case that will draw more attention to what they are trying to get taken down			1
@entity123 , a @entity124 - cased partner at the legal firm @entity125 , told @entity35 : ‘ the ruling makes clear that public figures have a lower expectation of privacy			1
‘ this judgment will help certain people , but not when it concerns public figures or people in whom there is a genuine public interest			1
’ legal experts have previously commented that the criteria for determining which take - down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the @entity94 court ’s decision			0
@entity2 has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and earlier this month sent notifications to people who requested a removal , asking them to bear with the search engine			2
it began removing the first results under the @entity11 data law last week , and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective .			0

people now have right to have ' irrelevant ' results about them removed
@entity2 already sent 50,000 requests and is starting to take down results
does *n't* believe ruling covers public figures who want to clean reputations
