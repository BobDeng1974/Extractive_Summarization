headlined ' @entity7 , @entity12 's @entity11 , ' the internet cartoon film is designed to convince voters the @entity15 leader and @entity16 were wrong to denounce the @entity18 's ' austerity @entity9 ' policies			2
@entity21 chiefs hope the spoof advertising campaign on the video - sharing website will be widely circulated			1
devised by @entity26 , its release comes just days before new figures are published this week that are expected to show the economy is continuing to grow			1
last week , other figures showed a drop in the number out of work			2
internet cartoon film is headlined ' @entity7 , @entity12 's @entity11 ' but the ' @entity7 ' video triggered an angry response from @entity15			0
told of the @entity21 campaign , a @entity15 insider said last night : ' puerile attacks like this are an insult to the millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet			1
' it marks the unofficial start of the campaign for the next election , not due until may 2015 , when the economy is likely to be the deciding factor			2
mr @entity1 is convinced the economic recovery will help him win and that @entity15 is on the back foot			0
@entity15 believes its pledge to freeze energy bills has showed the @entity21 are vulnerable to claims that they have not curbed the cost of living			1
the ' @entity7 ' film is the most aggressive @entity21 publicity attack on @entity15 since mr @entity4 became @entity15 leader in 2010 , though not the first time such a campaign has sparked controversy			1
in the @entity62 , @entity15 produced posters portraying @entity21 prime minister @entity64 as ' mr dither ' , based on the @entity68 children 's cartoon books , but the idea was vetoed by the series author @entity70			1
the @entity21 hit back by producing notorious ' @entity72 ' posters featuring @entity73 in an attempt to suggest that , behind his smile , he was a dangerous left - winger			1
mr @entity73 won by a landslide			0
when @entity77 succeeded mr @entity64 , a @entity15 campaign in the @entity79 featured mr @entity77 with a @entity81 - style blonde wig superimposed on his bald head - to suggest he shared her outdated views			0
mr @entity77 lost by a landslide			0
a @entity15 poster in the @entity87 portrayed mr @entity1 as tv detective @entity88 , played by actor @entity89 in the @entity91 series , but it backfired spectacularly			0
it showed mr @entity1 sitting on the bonnet of @entity88 's trademark @entity93 with the slogan : ' do n't let him take @entity9 back to the 1980s			0
' it was intended to link the @entity21 to the social unrest of that period			2
but mr @entity1 said he was ' flattered ' to be compared to @entity88 and adopted the image , replacing the slogan with : ' @entity88			0
it 's time for change			0
' @entity1 will this week launch a @entity3 attack on @entity4 and @entity5 the @entity21 @entity3 film will feature economic forecasts made by mr @entity4 and mr @entity5 and claim that they have repeatedly not been borne out by events			1
in one comment highlighted by the @entity21 , mr @entity4 said in october 2010 : ' they have a programme which will clearly lead to the disappearance of ... a million jobs			1
' the video says 1.4 million private sector jobs have been created since 2010			0
it also refers to a letter to chief secretary @entity115 from mr @entity5 in september , 2010 , in which he warned of a ' double dip recession ' caused by @entity119 cuts			2
the film says neither claim turned out to be true			0
a @entity26 spokesman said : ' @entity4 constantly tries to say the country faces disaster under our economic policies - only to be proved wrong time and again			1
we can make one prediction - if @entity15 's plan for more spending , borrowing and debt were to be enacted , we really would be in trouble			0

@entity21 chiefs this week launch a @entity3 attack on @entity4 and @entity5
