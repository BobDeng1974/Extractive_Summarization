@entity0 captains @entity1 against @entity2 on tuesday and will then quit international football despite @entity4 suggesting he still has an international future			1
@entity0 thinks it is the appropriate time to bow out and will do so having won 106 caps			2
he has an offer to play in @entity9 with @entity11 next season and that could lead to him playing in the @entity13 on loan			0
he will finish with just two fewer international caps than his father @entity16 ’s @entity17 pal and former @entity1 captain @entity18			2
one last time : @entity0 is expected to play his last @entity1 game against @entity2 history boy : @entity0 could become @entity1 's second youngest scorer at a @entity22 if he nets on tuesday @entity0 ’s record of 29 @entity1 goals is impressive , although @entity25 hit 49 and remains @entity1 's top all - time scorer with @entity28 closing the gap on 40			1
if @entity0 scores on tuesday he will become the second oldest player to score a goal at @entity22 finals for @entity1 having turned 36 four days ago			1
the oldest was sir @entity34 , who scored a late penalty in the 2 - 2 draw against @entity37 in 1958 at the age of 36 and 64 days			0
although @entity40 has asked for some time to consider his international future it is unlikely @entity4 will persuade him to change his mind on calling it a day with @entity1			1
as it stands @entity40 has 113 caps , two behind the most capped outfield player @entity46			0
goalkeeper @entity47 remains the most capped on 125			0
decision time : @entity40 will consider his international future after the @entity22 in @entity50 ends the @entity52 ' camp ' are now dropping heavy hints that when the @entity22 is over he will quit @entity54 with @entity55 and @entity56 set to battle it out for his services			1
a ' shoot out ' between the two @entity59 against would be appropriate			0
to his @entity61 team - mates @entity52 is known as ' @entity52 ' ... ' the @entity62			0
' in the last four @entity22 finals @entity64 ’s @entity63 has scored 15 goals compared to total of 17 by @entity1 over the same period			1
whether or not @entity68 starts against @entity69 on tuesday , he will no doubt have an impact on the game at some stage			1
@entity68 , who will quit international football at the @entity74 , will be determined to make sure that this game is not his last for the @entity76			1
perhaps one of the reasons for his longevity is that the 36 - year - old did n’t start a professional career until he was 21 with @entity82			0
high flyer : @entity68 may play his last game for the @entity76 against @entity69 on tuesday there is a growing feeling that too many young @entity88 strikers get burned out because they play far too much at a younger age - take the case of @entity91			1
and there is an argument , endorsed by @entity94 , that at 28 @entity28 has already peaked			0
at the same age @entity68 moved into his pomp at @entity97			0
and even a bit of racy lifestyle did n’t seem to harm @entity68			0
in his early days his team - mates called him ' @entity101 ' after the @entity103 rap because of his penchant for a wild nightlife			0
watch out for ... @entity106 was dropped for @entity108 ’s last game against @entity69 after a peripheral display in their 2 - 1 defeat to @entity76 in their opening game			1
but @entity106 is set to return on tuesday against @entity114 in a game @entity108 need to win if they want to progress from @entity108 must also hope @entity76 fail to beat @entity69			1
centre of attention : @entity119 is expected to return to @entity108 's startling line up against @entity121 on tuesday @entity106 ’s career at @entity123 could be revived under @entity124 , but if the @entity125 does n’t see him as part of his plans then he could return to @entity128			1
the @entity108 - @entity114 game is at 9pm on @entity130 , @entity69 is on @entity131 at the same time			1
i – say : ahead of an @entity22 qualifier against @entity135 in 1990 , @entity133 once explained with a combination of churchillian rhetoric and ' @entity139 slang ' that @entity1 would win because of ' the bulldog spirit , man '			1
they did the next night at @entity143 when a combination of panache and passion saw @entity1 blow @entity135 apart 3 - 0			2
such virtues seem very much out of fashion now - laughed off as ' old school ' - while the appliance of more and more sports science is seen as the way forward			0
young tyro : @entity154 scores for @entity1 against @entity135 at @entity143 left - field bolt : @entity157 scores for @entity1 against @entity135 at @entity143 in 1990 but a bloated back room staff of medics , spin and head doctors has hardly succeeded			2
if anything it ’s given the players more excuses and made them more mentally fragile indeed when you listen to what makes other countries tick many cite national pride and desire the very qualities that are laughed off by football ' hipsters ' in this country			0
explaining @entity176 ’s demise @entity177 spoke of a lack of ' hunger '			0
when @entity180 suggested that some @entity182 players made excuses not to join up with @entity1 it raises questions about the motivation of many when it comes to playing for @entity1			2
on that front perhaps the @entity188 should find some sort of role for @entity133 in the camp			0
on the notion that there are players who duck out of playing for @entity198 has said : ' the next young player who says he does not want play for @entity1 should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has dies in @entity202 , and tell him his reasons			2
that ’s the bulldog spirit , man			0
@entity22 moment : @entity209 , where @entity1 face @entity2 on tuesday , is of course the venue of @entity1 ’s most infamous defeat when they were beaten 1 - 0 by the @entity103 in 1950			1
shock : @entity1 lost to @entity103 1 - 0 in 1950 thanks to a goal from @entity217 ( right ) at the time @entity1 were regarded as the best team in the world with players like sir @entity34 and @entity221 - although @entity222 was dropped for the match			2
@entity1 also lost to @entity176 1 - 0 and were eliminated , although , they did beat @entity225 2 - 1			2
the chastening experience suffered is said to have inspired @entity1 ’s right back at that @entity22 to one day make amends and lift the trophy			2
@entity233 : the patriotic pound has proved very profitable for the bookies at the @entity22			0
so it ’s difficult to see the attraction of 4/5 on an @entity1 win … although @entity2 are resting players which maybe explains why you can 7/2 on them winning with the draw 11 - 4			1
a romantic punt for first goal scorer is @entity0 at 10 - 1 ; @entity244 is 13 - 2 to open the scoring for @entity2			1
@entity246 are 13 - 2 to beat @entity247 .			0

@entity0 expected to retire from international football after the @entity22
@entity0 will win his 106th @entity1 cap against @entity2
@entity40 is also expected to retire from @entity1
@entity68 may also play his last game for the @entity76 on tuesday
@entity119 expected to return to @entity108 starting line - up against @entity121
@entity133 is spot on about @entity1 - our players must show more spirit
