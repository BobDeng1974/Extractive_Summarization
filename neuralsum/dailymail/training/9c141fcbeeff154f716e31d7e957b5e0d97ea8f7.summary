@entity0 is on alert as a toxic red tide , the biggest since 2005 , is threatening holidaymakers as it moves down the coast			1
the red tide , with the scientific name of @entity7 , is caused by microscopic algae blooms that explode in numbers when the conditions are right			1
usually a phenomenon that occurs in late summer or early autumn , the tide can produce harmful chemicals and cause respiratory problems			1
if the red tide gets within a mile of the beach , the crashing waves could release the toxins into the @entity0 air @entity21 , a senior scientist at the @entity22 , told @entity23 : ' these kinds of blooms damage wildlife , people , tourism , everything			1
it can kill fish by the millions			0
' the red tide can be also be damaging to people , especially those suffering from chronic asthma , bronchitis , or emphysema			1
even those who do n't suffer from respiratory conditions can feel the red tide 's effects			1
humans near the bloom may experience coughing , sneezing , itchy skin and teary eyes			2
the dark red tide is clearly visible on the right - hand side , and more sparsely on the bottom left - hand side ' when the wind blows , you ca n't really breathe , ' said @entity21 , who has experienced it first - hand			1
' you start wheezing and coughing and you have to wear a surgical mask or move inland			0
' the microorganism can only be seen with a microscope			0
while it is always present in the @entity60 in negligible amounts , large blooms turn the sea a reddish brown color			0
the red tide is caused by microscopic algae blooms that explode in numbers when the conditions are right the current bloom is around 20 miles off the coast of @entity0 , too far away to affect beachgoers , at least for the meantime			1
while the red tide appears almost every year , officials have not seen one this size since 2005			2
it is currently thought to be stretching 90 miles long , 60 miles wide and at least 100 feet down			2
so far , the animal death count in the sea is moderate			0
around 1,000 fish and some crabs and octopi have been killed , according to the @entity81 , but that could change if it moves closer to shore			0
holidaymakers could be in danger if the red tide drifts to within a mile of the beaches			2
once it ’s that close , the crashing waves can release the toxins into the air			0
around 1,000 fish and some crabs and octopi have been killed by the red tide while humans risk a few nights resting in bed , the powerful toxins are much more harmful in other animals and can kill fish , shellfish , mammals and birds			1
in 2013 , a smaller red tide bloomed closer to the @entity0 shore , resulting in the deaths of 276 of the state ’s 5,000 manatees			1
the endangered mammals eat the toxic algae when it settles on the sea grass that they feed on			2
in 2004 , around 100 dolphins were found dead in the same area			0
when scientists examined their stomachs , they found fish contaminated by the algae			0
red tides are a natural phenomenon that happen almost every year and are very unpredictable			0
there is no real way to stop them			0
two underwater robots from @entity126 and the @entity127 have been monitoring the red tide in @entity0 and surrounding oceans since they were deployed on 1 august			1
the results from the robots are helping to shape short - term bloom forecasts .			0

red tide is caused by a huge bloom of microscopic toxic algae
@entity138 can create harmful chemicals and cause respiratory problems
current bloom is around 20 miles off the coast of @entity0
