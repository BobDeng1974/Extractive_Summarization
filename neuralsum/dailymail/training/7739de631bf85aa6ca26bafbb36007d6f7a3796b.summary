the closing 250km feature was abandoned with 29 laps to go after a storm of torrential rain and golf ball - sized hail lashed @entity36 , turning parts of the street circuit into a wild river			0
going hard : the six - times championship spent sunday night celebrating his success with friends and famiy it was almost a carbon copy of saturday 's 125km race , which also had to be suspended amid torrential rain			0

' i know this moment wo n't last forever , but i 'm in a very critical and amazing part of my life - which could be the best part of my life , i 'm not sure			0
' but i 'll come out again next year and try to do what i 've done the last three years and keep backing up and ride this massive roller coaster as long as i can			0

and he equals @entity95 's record for most successive championships with four			0
so how does 2014 stack up in the championship stakes ? ' it 's like your kids - you do n't have any favourites , they 're all good in their own way , ' he jokes			1
' i do n't have any kids - not that i know of anyway - but that 's probably the best way to sum up these championships			1
@entity110 , @entity3 celebrates winning the round after race three of round four of the @entity83 in 2007 and right , he holds aloft the @entity23 trophy after winning the 2008 competition ' right now , this one feels bigger , better and more important than any other - but that 's just because i 'm in the moment			1
' @entity3 said both he and @entity8 were very good at bottling up their emotions , but was planning to celebrate big with the team and family on sunday night			0
' you bottle all that emotion until moments like these , where you reflect on what the year 's been and certainly all the good things that have happened , ' he said			0
