by @entity0 a care assistant who drunkenly drove the wrong way along a motorway for four miles has been spared jail			1
@entity5 , 27 , admitted drink driving and dangerous driving and was told she had committed a ' very serious driving offence ' which passed the custody threshold			1
but when sentencing her judge @entity10 handed her a four - month jail term , suspended for 12 months			1
she was given 180 hours of unpaid work and a year ’s supervision by probation services for the dangerous driving offence			1
for driving with excess alcohol she was given a month in prison , also suspended for 12 months , to run concurrently , banned from driving for three years , and ordered to pay £ 200 costs			1
footage of the incident played in @entity34 showed oncoming lorry drivers flashing their headlights as @entity36 drove her @entity37 north on a southbound section of the @entity40 in the @entity41			1
@entity42 , prosecuting , said one lorry driver later told police of the moment he saw the headlights of @entity36 ’s car approaching him at speed and head - on along the slip road			1
she said : ' it left him feeling scared			0
' it was his daughter ’s birthday - he envisaged that somebody would be killed , and that he might never see his wife and daughter again			2
' ms @entity42 said that , at the last moment , @entity36 ' swerved ' across to the hard shoulder , avoiding a collision			0
@entity36 ( pictured ) admitted driving with excess alcohol and dangerous driving at @entity34 traffic police stopped @entity36 after she eventually exited the @entity40 in @entity65 in the early hours of december 4 last year , having joined the motorway at the previous junction in nearby @entity68			1
officers were dealing with a crash when they spotted @entity36 , of @entity71 , @entity41 , leaving the motorway , busy with @entity74 traffic , using an entry slip road			0
ms @entity42 said the police first tried to wave her down as she twice went the wrong way around the roundabout junction , and eventually halted her by stepping out into the road and flashing their torches			2
@entity82 footage released by @entity83 shows @entity36 careering the wrong way down the carriageway @entity36 was given 180 hours of unpaid work and a year ’s supervision by probation services for the dangerous driving offence ms @entity5 was sentenced after she pleaded guilty to charges of drink driving and dangerous driving @entity36 , her eyes red , was breathalysed and later blew a reading of 79 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath , which is more than twice the legal limit of 35mcg			1
@entity99 , in mitigation , said his client was of previous good character and was ' deeply , bitterly ashamed ' of her actions			0
he said friends , family and her gp all attested to the behaviour being ' wholly out - of - character ' for the single mother - of - three			2
however , he added @entity36 had been dealing with a depressive illness which may have been affected by a ' disastrous relationship ' with a former partner			0
he said : ' everything indicates that against very considerable personal adversity the defendant has kept in very reasonable work and been an extraordinarily good mother to her three children			0
' mr @entity99 said it was ' these pressures , with the under - tow of depression ' that went some way towards explaining why she got in her car drunk and drove the wrong way along the motorway			2
he added the impact on @entity36 , whose driving licence was previously clean , had hit ' very hard ' and he claimed had led to one of her children being bullied at school			2
@entity36 ’s father , who was in court supporting his daughter , was ' a professional driver ' , mr @entity99 added , and the crimes had no doubt therefore brought particular ' dishonour and shame '			2
speaking after sentence outside court , a remorseful homer said she was ' sorry ' for her actions			0
her father , who gave his name as @entity145 , added : ' she ’s sorry for what she has done and she just wants to put this behind her now and focus on the children '			0
commenting on the case , inspector @entity150 , of @entity83 , said : ' there is no doubt how serious this incident could have been			0
' @entity82 footage from the time shows other vehicles having to move out of the way			0
' thankfully , due to the time of day , the motorway was not as busy as it otherwise might have been and so no significant harm was caused to others			0
' ultimately driving whilst under the influence poses a risk to both the driver and others on the road - regardless of whether it is on a motorway or a quiet side street , and this case will hopefully serve as a warning to others who make the dangerous mistake of getting behind the wheel after they ’ve had a drink			1
