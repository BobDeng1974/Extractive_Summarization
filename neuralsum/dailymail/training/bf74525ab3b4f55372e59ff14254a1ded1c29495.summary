by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 07:53 est , 11 september 2012 mps have been given free corporate tickets to the most sought - after event at the @entity4 – the men ’s 100m final			1
four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from @entity11 , one of @entity14 ’s leading sponsors			1
ministers have been banned from freebie trips to the @entity17			1
but the culture committee chairman , @entity18 , gave @entity11 permission to offer the hottest tickets in town – worth £ 420 each – to his members because they have been scrutinising the @entity17 for five years			1
gold dust : culture committee chairman @entity18 ( left ) gave @entity11 permission to give away the coveted tickets while @entity28 mp @entity27 ( right ) admitted to accepting one @entity11 confirmed last night that four of the 11 mps on the committee have so far accepted seats			1
the news came as it was revealed the military is to provide up to 3,500 extra personnel for the @entity17 after a private firm admitted it could not supply enough guards to protect the public			2
last night critics said the @entity30 ’ decision to take up @entity11 ’s offer represented a conflict of interest , since the committee is a watchdog over telecoms issues			2
@entity11 has also made a multi-million pound move into the sports rights market winning the right to screen @entity49 football for the first time			2
the @entity30 ’ decision to accept free tickets will enrage the millions of people who have found it impossible to get any @entity4 seats at all			1
fury : sir @entity56 , the former chairman of the @entity57 , condemned the decision @entity11 are keen to stress that they are not laying on a lavish hospitality package around the 100m final on august 5 , like those costing around £ 7,000 which have been offered on the open market			1
but the @entity30 will be taken to the @entity64 in @entity65 where they will attend a briefing on the company ’s role in the @entity17 before being ferried to the @entity69 where they will watch the race			0
yesterday @entity28 mp mr @entity18 defended his right to a free seat at the 100m final			1
he said : ‘ @entity11 are having a briefing on their involvement in the @entity4			0
my committee has spent five years having regular sessions on the preparations for the @entity4			2
it ’s not terribly surprising that we might have wanted to go and have a look			0
‘ this is not the first time i ’ve been to events with @entity11 or companies that operate in the area that we scrutinise			0
but they are a major sponsor of the @entity4 and have put a huge amount of money into the @entity17			0
‘ it would be utterly extraordinary if we did n’t take a look at the @entity17			0
i do n’t see that this compromises the committee at all			2
’ he admitted he is also attending @entity4 events with the organising committee @entity95 and other events on behalf of the government			1
but he admitted the tickets to the star event of the entire games was ‘ a great invitation ’ and added : ‘ of course i want to go to the 100m men ’s final			1
it ’s one of the most exciting events			0
’ he also conceded the tickets ‘ might encourage people to attend the @entity11 briefing ’			2
@entity28 mp @entity27 also admitted that he has accepted a ticket to the 100m and said : ‘ somebody invited us to go along			1
we ’ve been scrutinising the @entity4 for ages			0
i do n’t see why we should n’t go along and have a look at the @entity17			0
’ olympic stadium : thousands of fans were not able to get tickets to the @entity17 main event : @entity119 's @entity118 ( r ) wins the men 's 100m final at the @entity122 as part of the @entity124 but a @entity126 note circulated to ministers told them : ‘ the presumption for all invitations should be that they are declined			1
should you feel there is an exceptional case to justify attendance it will need to be supported by a business case and to come to the @entity126 for approval			0
’ sir @entity56 , the former chairman of the @entity57 , condemned the decision of the mps to accept , pointing out that the @entity30 will not have to declare the tickets on the @entity140 until three months after the @entity17			2
four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from @entity11 , one of @entity14 ¿ s leading sponsors he said : ‘ i am sure most people would be appalled that mps are being given special treatment when the rest of the population have had to go through all sorts of hoops to get a volleyball ticket			1
‘ it is appalling that they can accept these tickets and they do n’t have to declare them until after the @entity4 are over			2
if people are accepting offers of this sort they should declare them immediately and let their constituents make a judgment about whether they are appropriate or not			2
’ @entity164 , of the pressure group @entity165 , said : ‘ you can understand why @entity30 would jump at these tickets , but to accept them shows very poor judgment			2
these tickets are like gold dust – thousands applied for them			1
‘ corporate hospitality as a lobbying tactic runs through our politics			0
this raises the question of what @entity11 hopes to get in return			0
it looks very much like they are trying to curry favour with a group of mps whose job it is to monitor its industry			0
’ former mp and anti-sleaze campaigner @entity185 said : ‘ if i were an honourable member and the public are paying hundreds of pounds for tickets i would wonder why mps get to go for free and what was expected in return			1
‘ mps have to be very careful about conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest			0
’ several members of the culture committee , which has shot to prominence as a result of its role investigating the @entity204 phone hacking scandal , have turned down the tickets on the grounds that they do n’t think the offer is appropriate			1
doing the right thing : @entity210 mp @entity209 decided not to take a ticket while @entity28 @entity212 said she had considered taking the ticket before declining @entity210 ’s @entity209 , the most high - profile member of the committee , told the @entity215 : ‘ i ’ve taken a personal decision not to accept freebies			1
this is the sports committee and if any section of @entity219 is going , it should be them			0
but on a personal level i applied for tickets and could n’t get any and i ’d feel a bit uncomfortable doing it this way			2
’ at least two other members of the committee , former @entity210 sports minister @entity228 and @entity230 @entity229 , will not attend the 100m final , but are likely to see some of the events since they are @entity4 ambassadors charged with accompanying foreign dignitaries to events			1
fellow @entity28 @entity212 said she had considered taking the ticket before declining			1
she said : ‘ i have turned it down but i ’m glad @entity18 is going to see how they handle the flagship event as he has been supervising our inquiry for years			1
i do n’t need to see it myself but i am happy to delegate			0
’ @entity30 @entity241 and @entity242 said they had also not taken tickets from @entity11			0
the remaining committee members – tories @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity210 mp @entity248 – all failed to return calls , though it is thought that two of them have accepted tickets			1
a spokesman for @entity11 said : ‘ the cross party committee have a remit that covers the @entity4 and so as a major sponsor we feel it is appropriate to brief them on @entity11 ’s role in helping to deliver the @entity17 as well as the impact for the legacy programme and local regeneration			0
the briefing concludes with our hosting them at the stadium			0
‘ four members of the committee have accepted to date and the cost to @entity11 is under £ 500 per guest			1
‘ the vast majority of the tickets we have bought are going to our retail customers through our @entity275 promotion or our employees for reward and recognition			0
’ an amendment has been made to this article since publication after @entity242 mp contacted us			0
he wished to confirm that whilst he was offered @entity4 tickets , he did not accept the offer .			0
