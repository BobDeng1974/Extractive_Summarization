by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 wants to show he deserves a place at the top table by forming a 50 - over opening partnership with @entity6 that can prove @entity8 ’s captain and their one - day cricket are not stuck in the dark ages			1
@entity2 is aiming to emulate @entity12 ’s @entity11 and complete the journey from @entity15 specialist to test opener but first he is tasked with providing the power in @entity8 ’s one - day cricket they are accused of sorely lacking			1
the @entity20 batsman faces @entity21 in the third one - day international at his home @entity23 ground as the flag carrier for the breed of modern big - hitting batsman that are still all too often treated with suspicion by @entity8			1
power play : @entity2 , in the @entity23 nets , is relishing life at the top of the order for @entity8 criticism of @entity8 ’s approach to the 50 - over game and @entity6 ’s role in it from @entity37 and @entity38 this week coupled with an abject performance in @entity40 means the pressure is once again back on the skipper			1
@entity2 , whose form has been transformed since he was sent out on loan to @entity45 at the start of this season in order to get a game , is adamant he is the man to lift that pressure now he has finally been given his 50 - over chance			2
‘ this is a dream come true , ’ said @entity2 of his @entity8 50 - over elevation after enduring a torrid 2013			1
‘ and making my debut now is all the better after how last year went in first - class cricket			2
i ’ve had to work really hard to show people i can be more than just a @entity15 slogger and i ’m really happy this opportunity has come along , even more so because i ’ll be in front of my home crowd			0
’ his style , which is more orthodox than he is often given credit for , has the potential to complement that of @entity6 , who silenced those who questioned his one - day credentials three years ago by scoring four hundreds and six half centuries in his first 19 innings as 50 - over captain			1
now the man who has led @entity8 to more one - day victories than any other captain has to do so again			1
a whole new ball game : @entity6 spins out a pass with a rugby ball at @entity23 kicking on : @entity2 gives the ball a boot as he prepares to smash @entity21 around on his home ground @entity8 ( probable ) : @entity6 ( capt ) , @entity2 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 ( wkt ) , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90			1
@entity21 ( probable ) : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 ( capt / wkt ) , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101			0
start : 10.30am , @entity23			0
umpires : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) and @entity105 ( @entity106 )			0
@entity37 on friday repeated his view first expressed on radio that @entity6 should stand down from the one - day captaincy in his column in @entity111 and said : ‘ i think being one - day captain is a poisoned chalice for him			1
he just does n’t need the job			0
' the 50 - over cricket @entity8 are playing is outdated and i feel it will be a painful winter			2
this is not a witch - hunt but i do n’t want @entity119 to be part of it			2
’ @entity2 , until this season a county colleague of @entity37 , defended his captain			1
‘ everyone ’s entitled to their opinion but the guys in the dressing room are a hundred per cent behind @entity6 and if you look at his record in one - day cricket it ’s a pretty good one , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ all the guys are backing him to lead from the front as we look to bounce back in this series			0
’ running the show : @entity139 and @entity2 seem to be enjoying the sprint training much of what @entity37 and @entity38 said in a @entity143 test match special wet weather debate was valid but it also should be said that it is surely far too simplistic to believe @entity8 could throw @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 into the team as well as @entity2 and expect them all to swim rather than sink			1
@entity147 in particular has cause to feel hard done by , as does @entity151 whose omission from this squad remains mystifying , but there remains good reasons why @entity6 , @entity82 , @entity156 and @entity139 were named to face @entity21 while @entity8 have not been helped by the fact that their key one - day batsman in @entity84 has looked out of sorts			1
they have three more chances against an @entity21 side who will be without the injured @entity164 for the rest of the series to prove the selectors right while @entity148 will be given his chance in the @entity15 international that follows			0
in the centre : @entity172 ( middle ) takes a pass during the training game of rugby if @entity2 , the most technically adept of the next generation , can build on his debut score of 40 in @entity179 which stood out in a lamentable @entity8 performance he has every chance of putting pressure on @entity183 ahead of @entity8 ’s next @entity185 assignment in the @entity186 in april			2
‘ test cricket is definitely in the back of my head , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ it always has been , even after the terrible time i had last year			0
it ’s always been my dream to play test cricket and that ’s going to come with a lot more hard work			0
‘ there are people around the world who have shown what can be done			0
@entity11 , @entity202 and @entity203 , those guys are attacking opening batsmen			0
but it will take a lot of technical work and that ’s up to me			0
’ a big performance in a series levelling win would be a start			0
making his point : @entity21 coach @entity214 talks to the hero of @entity40 , @entity95			0

@entity2 ' *strokeplay* can complement @entity6 *'s* style
@entity37 says @entity6 should step down as one - day captain
but @entity2 defended @entity8 skipper - ' his odi record is pretty good '
