@entity0 has published a video explaining his row with @entity3 after the @entity4			1
@entity0 complained during a heated press conference that his @entity7 team - mate @entity3 , the race winner who was sitting next to him as he spoke , had acted ‘ selfishly ’ in slowing down to such an extent that he ( @entity0 ) could have been caught by @entity9 of @entity10			1
speaking on video more calmly later , @entity0 , who finished second , a place ahead of @entity9 , answered questions he had received from fans about the furore			1
@entity0 responded to a fan who accused @entity0 of ' crying ' after he complained about @entity3 @entity3 celebrates his win with the @entity7 team , but @entity0 appears less pleased with 2nd @entity3 crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in @entity23 one asked if he was ‘ crying ’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser			1
@entity0 said : ‘ you say that i was crying			2
ok , i respect your opinion , and i ’ll keep it in mind and i ’ll try to show respect when it ’s due going forward			0
’ @entity0 was a few seconds behind @entity3 when the world champion slowed			1
so why did he not push on and try to pass his team - mate rather than ask his pit wall engineers to tell @entity3 to speed up so he could move away from @entity9 ? @entity3 and @entity0 spray champagne from the podium as @entity7 celebrate a one - two finish @entity0 was clearly angry with @entity3 in the press conference and hit out at his team - mate ‘ i understand why you ’re asking that , ’ said @entity0 to that question			1
‘ it might not be so easy to understand from the outside			0
but the reason is , i did try to attack @entity3 in the first stint , and it just did n’t work			1
all i did was destroy my tyres			0
‘ so in the second stint there was no point to do that again , because this time there was @entity9 right behind and it would ’ve really risked my second place if i had tried that , because i would have completely destroyed my tyres , again , and @entity9 could have had a really good shot at overtaking me			2
my only chance of winning the race anyway , or to fight @entity3 , or try to overtake him , would have come at the end of the race , so that ’s what i was building up to			1
’ @entity0 made the video – he posts his thoughts following each race – after discussing the incident with his team management before leaving the @entity67 track			1
the @entity69 driver denied he had done anything wrong following @entity0 's accusations @entity3 backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team - mate 's race he added : ‘ it was definitely intense after the race , but we had a very good sit down , a good discussion			1
there was a lot of constructive criticism , and now it ’ s a thing of the past for everybody and we ’re moving on to @entity85			0
‘ the worst part of the weekend was losing out to @entity3 in qualifying			2
and it was by just four - hundredths			0
that ’s all down to me to be those five - hundredths quicker next time			0
’ @entity0 has since travelled to @entity91 en route to the next race in @entity85 on sunday			1
was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from @entity10 and , also , can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up ? were you aware that @entity0 was getting so backed - up towards @entity9 ? @entity102 : i was n’t controlling his race , i was controlling my own race but , great race , i ’m really happy			1
definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the @entity111 were very , very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres			2
so , today the real goal was to manage the tyres			0
and , as i said , my goal was to look after my car			0
i had no real threat from @entity0 through the whole race			1
so , i just managed it and got to really enjoy it , to be honest			0
a few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop , which i really enjoyed			0
ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole , full practice sessions , on my side of the garage at least			2
and it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race			2
so really happy , and yeah , kinda excited			0
q : @entity0 , can you talk us through your view of the race today			1
started second , finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe ? @entity148 : no. it ’s just now interesting to hear from you , @entity3 , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front , and necessarily that was compromising my race			2
driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that @entity9 was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for @entity9 to try that early pit - stop to try and jump me			2
and then i had to cover him			0
so , first of all it was unnecessarily close with @entity9 as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because i had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer			1
so i ’m unhappy about that , of course , today			0
other than that , not much to say			0
q : @entity3 , would you like to respond ? @entity102 : not really ! my job is not to … it ’s not my job to look after @entity0 ’s race			1
my job ’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that ’s what i did			0
i did n’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up			0
i just was focussing on myself			0
if @entity0 wanted to get by he could have tried but he did n’t .			2
