by @entity0 last updated at 1:39 pm on 14th november 2011 three astronauts blasted off today for the @entity2 as @entity3 seeks to restore confidence in its space programme following the recent crash of a cargo spaceship and several botched launches			1
the launch was the first since @entity11 ended its 30 - year shuttle programme in july , heralding a gap of several years when the 16 nations investing in the $ 100billion ( £ 63billion ) space station will rely solely on @entity3 to ferry crews			1
‘ the spaceship has reached orbit , ’ flight engineer @entity17 said in a radioed message to the cavernous @entity19 in a northern @entity21 suburb			0
up , up and away : @entity3 's @entity25 spacecraft with the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) expedition 30 on board blasts off from the @entity3 - leased @entity29 cosmodrome @entity30 broke out as the crew flashed a thumbs - up signal to on - board cameras			1
the mission had been delayed since september over safety fears after an unmanned @entity3 progress craft taking supplies to astronauts broke up in the atmosphere in august , one of the worst @entity3 space mishaps in decades			1
veteran @entity11 astronaut @entity42 is making his first voyage on board a @entity47 spacecraft from @entity3 's @entity49 launchpad in @entity50 , while cosmonauts @entity17 and @entity52 are making their maiden space voyage			2
ready and waiting : the @entity47 craft stands on the launch pad the crew had shrugged off safety concerns before their craft lifted off from a snowbound @entity49 , blazing a bright orange trail through the overcast sky above the @entity50 steppe			0
‘ we do n't have any black thoughts			0
we have faith in our equipment , ’ @entity3 news agencies quoted @entity17 as saying before the launch			2
reporting back to @entity19 after take off , he said the crew was ‘ feeling good ’			0
a small stuffed bird from the mobile app @entity71 , a mascot given to @entity17 by his five - year - old daughter , hovered above the weightless crew			0
ice one : the @entity47 rocket sits in the launch pad in freezing conditions prior to blast off , left			0
the arms eventually move away as the launch approaches , right ‘ except for the bad weather in @entity49 , everything went extremely well , ’ @entity82 , head of launches for the @entity3 segment of the @entity2 , told reporters at @entity19			1
after a cramped two - day journey aboard the @entity25 capsule , the crew will dock with the space station on november 16 , overlapping briefly with station commander @entity92 of @entity11 , @entity94 's @entity93 and @entity3 's @entity95			0
any problem in reaching the @entity2 could leave the space station empty for the first time in more than a decade when the current three - man crew returns to @entity100 later this month			1
final frontier awaits : ( from left ) @entity3 cosmonaut @entity17 , @entity102 astronaut @entity42 and @entity3 cosmonaut @entity52 , pose for photos prior to the launch @entity3 's space agency chief has said the august 24 failure of the progress rocket launch was an ‘ isolated ’ glitch caused by a fuel pipe blockage			1
but it added to a string of failures that marred this year 's celebration of the 50 years since @entity115 's pioneering orbit and pointed to deeper troubles with @entity3 's space industry			0
@entity21 hopes a smooth mission will begin to restore its reputation after more trouble this week when a launch touted as post-soviet @entity3 's interplanetary debut went awry			2
@entity3 is likely to have lost the $ 165 - million @entity124 probe , which is stuck in orbit and may drop to @entity100 after it failed to set a course toward @entity129 's moon on wednesday			0
botched launches have also lost @entity3 a high - tech military orbiter , a costly telecommunication satellite , and set back plans for a global navigation system to rival the @entity102 gps			2
while @entity11 suffered the tragic loss of crews on its @entity139 and @entity140 shuttles in 2003 and 1986 , @entity3 last suffered such an accident in 1971 , when three cosmonauts died on their way back to @entity100 on the soyuz - 11 mission			0
this year the @entity102 turned over all crewed flight responsibilities to @entity3 , at a cost of about $ 350million ( £ 220million ) a year , until commercial firms can offer space - taxi rides			1
@entity11 is seeking $ 850million ( £ 535million ) to help @entity102 - based private companies develop human orbital transport capabilities with the goal of breaking @entity3 's monopoly on ferrying astronauts to the space station before the end of 2016 .			1
