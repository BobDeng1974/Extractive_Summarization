by @entity0 published : 15:46 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 12 december 2013 @entity2 @entity1 may have needed a bigger boat for his catch - had he not hooked a great white shark right from the beach			1
@entity1 , a combat engineer and avid angler , was fishing off @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , with his wife and baby daughter in late october when suddenly his line started rolling off the reel			1
luckily , his wife , @entity15 , had a camera on hand and caught it all on video			0
the gunnery master sergeant is an experienced fisherman , but this was his first great white shark			2
' seeing it in the water was just , it was almost mind blowing , ' he said			0
' it 's taken several weeks to get the whole ordeal to sink in			0
' @entity51 's video and still photos posted on her husband 's facebook page show the @entity2 hauling the sleek grey beast onto the sand by the tail			0
the shark measured nine - and - a - half feet in length - likely a young female - with rows of razor - sharp , serrated teeth clearly visible in its open maw			1
@entity63 fishing trip : @entity1 was on the beach with his wife , @entity15 ( left ) and baby daughter when he caught the @entity39 patience rewarded : @entity1 was fishing for about two hours when suddenly something heavy tugged on his line given that it is illegal to catch @entity72 , @entity1 was forced to drag the deadly predator back into the surf and let her go			1
@entity1 's impressive feat likely marks the first time that an angler hooked a @entity39 from the beach in the @entity79 the @entity2 , who just moved to @entity10 from @entity81 , said that hooking , dragging the beast out and then returning her into the ocean took him some 25 minutes - and he was exhausted by the end			1
‘ just still kind of elated about the moment , ’ he recalled			0
trailblazer : @entity1 is likely the first angler in the @entity79 to catch a @entity39 from the beach law - abiding citizen : it is illegal to target @entity39 sharks in the @entity79 , so @entity1 released the critter back into the ocean after posing with her this was not @entity1 's first shark : he has pulled bull sharks , tiger sharks , lemon and sandbar sharks , but never a @entity39			1
all that , however , changed on october 27 , when he , wife @entity15 , their daughter and pet dog took a trip to the beach			0
armed with chunks of stingray as bait , @entity108 reported , @entity1 stood on the beach with his fishing pole for two hours with little to show for it until he felt a tug on the line			2
‘ i did n't realize it was a @entity39 while i was catching it , but i knew it was something heavy , ’ he said			0
at one point toward the end of the video posted on @entity1 ’s @entity123 channel , the @entity2 coolly opens the shark 's mouth , revealing the fearsome jaws			1
born free : about 30 minutes after the shark first grabbed the bait , the angler led her back into the deep and watched her swim away @entity1 noted in the description of the video that ‘ in no way shape or form is it legal to specifically target @entity72			2
' he added : ' this shark was not targeted and was released in a timely manner			0
' @entity1 said the man - eating fish was very calm as he led her back into the deep .			2

@entity1 caught 9 - and - a - half foot young female shark off @entity8 , @entity10 , using chunk of stingray
ended up releasing predator back into the ocean because it 's illegal to haul great whites
