now @entity10 's granddaughter @entity9 says she feels staff ' put my nan in the bin '			1
mrs @entity10 died from pneumonia last month after a three week stay in hospital			1
staff at the @entity19 left @entity10 's granddaughter @entity20 feeling they had ' put nan in the bin ' the @entity25 , 91 , whose possessions were thrown away by care home staff after her death ms @entity10 intended to place some of her grandmother 's possessions in her coffin ahead of her funeral this week			1
but when a friend went to the @entity19 in @entity34 , @entity35 , to collect the last of the items , he was sent away			1
ms @entity10 then received a phone call telling her that her grandmother 's things had been binned			1
staff at the home , where mrs @entity10 had lived for two years at a cost of Â£ 12,000 had moved her belongings to another room after her death at the @entity46 in @entity47 on january 26			1
her granddaughter went with her friend @entity49 to take them away , but realised they needed to make a second journey			2
mrs @entity10 's wedding ring , family photograph albums , furniture , handbags and cuddly toys had been thrown away			1
the care home then caused further upset by addressing letters to mr @entity49 rather than to ms @entity10 , adding ' insult to injury '			1
@entity20 said : ' i have never felt so sad			2
' it is bad enough that my lovely grandmother has passed away but not being able to have her things around me is just indescribable			0
' she had been in hospital for three weeks and the care home had moved her into a new room so there would have been no rubbish for the belongings to get mixed up with			0
' she never got to see the new room			0
i am appalled that this was allowed to happen and i still have not had a proper apology			0
' i am finding it hard to concentrate on anything because i just ca n't get it out of my head and it 's all because of some incompetent staff member at the care home			0
granddaughter @entity20 said : ' not being able to have her things around me is just indescribable ' ' how could anyone possibly see all those things and assume they are rubbish ? there should be strict checks on these things			1
' we have looked at seeking out a solicitor but it 's really expensive			0
' it 's not really the money we are worried about anyway , it 's the fact that they put my nan in the bin			0
' this whole thing has caused a lot of distress and upset			0
' a spokesman for @entity103 , the company which operates @entity19 , said : ' we are extremely sorry for the distress this has caused and apologised to the family as soon as we were aware of the error			2
' we have reviewed our processes and spoken to all members of staff to ensure the utmost care is taken with residents ' possessions			0
' we are meeting the family to discuss how we can make amends			0
