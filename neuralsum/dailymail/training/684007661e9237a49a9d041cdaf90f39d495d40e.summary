a man who was charged with the murder of his father and spent 10 months in jail before pacemaker records proved his alibi is now seeking $ 5million in damages from @entity8 police			1
@entity9 was visiting his grandparents on an early february morning in 2012 when his father @entity11 , who he lived with at the time , was stabbed to death five times			1
it was @entity9 who found his father bleeding on the kitchen floor , the knife still in his chest			2
@entity19 was charged with his father 's murder , despite his protestations he was visiting his grandmother when his father was attacked			1
@entity9 spent 10 months in jail after being charged for the murder of his father @entity11 ( pictured ) before pacemaker records proved that he was visiting his grandparents when @entity11 was killed @entity11 's pacemaker had recorded his heart 's very last beat , at 10:35am that morning			1
but that very evidence which proved @entity9 's innocence , and was provided to police by @entity31 in july , lay sitting for months in a 15,000 - page folder deemed ' marginally relevant , ' according to the @entity33			1
meanwhile @entity9 was sitting in jail , having been charged for his father 's murder and denied bail by police in november			1
pacemakers use electrical pulses to help regulate abnormal heart rhythms			0
they are placed in the abdomen or chest and are hooked up to a computer , which collects data regarding the heart 's electrical activity			0
when the heart rhythm is abnormal , the computer directs a generator hooked up to the pacemaker to deliver the electrical pulses			0
models like the one @entity11 used also record if an electrical pulse was unsuccessful in its attempt to contract the heart			0
which is how the pacemaker was able to record when exactly his heart beat last			0
sources : @entity60 , @entity33 it would be 10 months before his lawyers found the data that would set him free			1
@entity9 is now seeking compensation , recently filing a claim for wrongful arrest and detention , as well as investigation negligence			2
the 31 - year - old said police ruined his life , destroying his career and reputation			0
despite the fact that four witnesses confirmed @entity9 had been visiting his ill grandmother at the time his father was killed , @entity76 police were convinced he was the murderer			1
they tracked @entity9 's car , read his text messages and intercepted his phone calls , and even asked his sister to wear a wire while confronting him			1
and , according to the suit , one officer tried to ruin @entity9 's reputation with his family and friends , while another made threats to his girlfriend			2
it claims one officer said @entity9 ' was a drug addict , as well as a liar and a murderer , ' and another warned @entity9 's girlfriend , who had children , that she would be reported to child protective services if she did not kick him out of the house			2
@entity102 , one of @entity9 's lawyers , said @entity9 was accused of the crime ' long before any sensible investigation had been undertaken			1
' ' on the flimsiest of evidence , they came to him and suggested he had been complicit			0
' @entity9 is now seeking $ 5million in damages from the police			1
his claims include that officers tried to ruin his reputation and that one officer told his girlfriend @entity114 ( pictured ) to kick @entity9 out of the house @entity9 maintained his innocence and some family members , as well as his girlfriend , still stood by him			0
he also co-operated with police , providing dna , fingerprint samples , his car and clothes			0
the suit alleges that police chose to ' ignore and bury ' the pacemaker records , which were only uncovered by @entity9 's lawyers 10 months after he was charged but the suit alleges police continued to fumble the investigation			1
they waited eight months to do a dna analysis , did n't request @entity9 's clothes until days after the murder , and , although they had already searched the house immediately after the killing , they decided to search it again three months later			1
and when @entity9 refused to take a polygraph test because he found them unreliable , police took it as ' further evidence of his guilt '			2
investigators had actually used the pacemaker as a threat to @entity9 , telling him it would have ' a lot of information ' on it			0
@entity9 told the @entity33 he remembered replying , ' go ahead and do that '			0
but they did n't and the suit alleges they instead chose to ' ignore and bury it '			0
@entity9 's charges were withdrawn in december 2013 , after his lawyers had experts analyze the pacemaker data			1
it was ruled that ' there was no longer a reasonable chance of a conviction ' based on medical evidence			0
a @entity76 police spokesman said they could not comment on the case because of current legal proceedings			0
as for @entity11 , his murder is listed on the @entity76 police website as an unsolved homicide			2
but @entity9 said that , instead of trying to figure out who killed his father , he owes it to @entity11 to restore the family name ' back to where it once was ' .			2

@entity9 's father @entity11 was stabbed five times in his kitchen
