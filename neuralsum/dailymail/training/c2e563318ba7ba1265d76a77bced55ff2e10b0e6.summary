the phrase has been used to unite those standing in solidarity with the victims			2

in an email sent out to staff on thursday , @entity47 - based editor and executive producer @entity50 , suggests a list of questions that should guide the channel 's coverage of the attack			1
he starts by explaining that the email is intended to ensure that the channel 's ' coverage is the best it can be ' , according to the @entity60 , who has published the emails in full			1
@entity50 urged his employees to question if the terrorist attack was ' really an attack on free speech , ' asking whether an ' attack by 2 - 3 guys ' on ' a controversial magazine ' was equal to a ' civilizational attack on @entity72 values '			2
he goes on to ask staff members to discuss whether ' i am @entity26 ' - a slogan used to unite those standing in solidarity with the terror victims - was ' alienating ' , creating an ' us and them ' mentality			2
' extremist ' : @entity47 - based editor and executive producer @entity50 suggests framing the attack on the @entity9 offices in @entity39 , pictured above , as a ' clash of extremist fringes ' @entity50 explains that people can be ' against @entity9 [ @entity9 ] racism and also against murdering people '			1

it read : ' if a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something , then it 's something that almost certainly needs to be said , because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization			0
' this prompted a response from @entity116 - based @entity115 , who reported for @entity3 's @entity118 - language channel before joining its @entity120 wing in 2006			1
he said that ' what @entity9 did was not free speech ' , adding that ' it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion '			1
