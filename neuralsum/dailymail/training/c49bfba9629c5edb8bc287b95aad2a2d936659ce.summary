@entity0 has spoken of the difficulty he had staying fit while waiting for his £ 31.9million move to @entity3 to go through			1

the 23 - year - old agreed personal terms and passed a medical on a visit to @entity17 last month , but has been training on his own since returning from the @entity18 and a brief holiday while he waited for his future to be resolved			1
‘ i will be able to train again			2
it was good to be on holidays but after a time i started to find the time quite long			2
‘ i went on a run every day and trained in the gym			2
holidays are great but if the time is too long , it is difficult to come back			0
i think that i will need a bit of time in order to be 100 per cent but it is normal – it is like those who returned to training last week , but i will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible			2
‘ i am really very happy to be part of the team and i will work hard because we have lots of goals and it is very important to start to work as soon as possible			0

‘ i am quite a fast defender			2
i am good in challenges , good in the air			0
i have the ability to score goals and have done so in the past few seasons			0
i wo n’t score 10 goals - a - season but for a defender i get my share from set - pieces			1
‘ i am motivated because to be part of a team like @entity3 i have already proved that i have a certain value , but i will not stop trying to improve			1
‘ to be part of a squad is good but like everybody else i want to play and it will be down to the manager to make his choice			0
i will work hard to try to have a spot in the starting xi but the most important is that the team win the games , win titles			0
it is my main goal : work in order to help the team to win as many titles as possible			0
’ @entity108 and @entity109 were also linked with @entity0 but the @entity111 @entity18 defender admits that he was impressed by @entity3 ’s success in recent years and the fact that they made the most effort to bring him to @entity117 football			1
‘ @entity3 is a big team in @entity117 and they proved it again this year by winning the title , ’ he said			1
‘ then it is the team that showed me the most interest			0
i had the opportunity to talk with the manager and the football director and it is also important to have some guarantees when you move to a new club			1
i had this opportunity to talk and i liked what they said so i signed with @entity3			1
‘ the squad is great so it will allow me to progress again			0
i am also someone who likes to win titles and i know that with the squad we have we can do great things			0

@entity62 also has @entity148 and @entity149 at his disposal , although @entity151 and @entity152 are expected to move on			2
‘ @entity139 and @entity145 are two players who possess great experience , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity139 is the captain of @entity3 and the @entity57 national team , @entity145 has enjoyed a great career			1
he played for @entity158 and he is now at @entity3 and has a big experience behind him			2
‘ they are players that i can look at and from whom i will learn a lot			0
they will have lots of advice for me regarding what they have already experienced			0
it will help me to progress and i am sure that everything will be fine			0
they are players that have lived through a lot of big moments and have a big experience so it can only be beneficial for me			0
’ @entity0 joins his former @entity9 teammate @entity141 at the @entity25 after the @entity173 midfielder moved for £ 12m earlier this summer			1

there are quite a lot of @entity174 players and @entity141 , who i was in touch during all the preparation because i came here earlier			2
‘ i had the chance to talk with him and there are some players that speak @entity192 and i understand a bit of that language so i think it will be quite quick for me to settle in			0
