it was the day before @entity2 's return to @entity3 and @entity4 was holding court in the media auditorium at @entity7			1
a naturally bubbly character , @entity4 was in high spirits as he focused on the imminent clash with @entity11 but it was only a matter of time before he knew the topic of conversation would change			2
he would have to confront a difficult summer and testing start to the new campaign			0
' a little bit sticky , ' was how he chose to describe the last four months			0
it was , perhaps , an understatement			0
having been in the firing line for @entity24 's @entity23 demise and scrutinised for the poor goals @entity2 had been conceding , lesser souls might have found it all too much			1
@entity4 is not one to shy away from pressure , and has faced a difficult period admirably @entity2 captain @entity4 was impressive against @entity28 in the @entity30 derby on saturday @entity4 scored a stunning goal from 25 yards to rescue a late point for his @entity2 side @entity4 , though , is not someone who will ever hide			1
he is a character who will face up to issue and however hard he found the questions , he answered them impressively			0
he fights and does n't give in			0
that is why , in the 91st minute of the 223rd @entity30 derby , he was scuffling around the edge of @entity28 's penalty area , trying to find a way of helping his team salvage something from a game that was slipping away			1
how @entity2 's captain delivered			1
latching on to a headed clearance from @entity47 , @entity4 crashed volley from 25 yards into the top corner of @entity50 net , to leave @entity51 – bar one delirious @entity53 corner – in stunned silence			1
it was , undoubtedly , the most spectacular goal scored by an @entity2 player behind enemy lines since @entity59 's howitzer in 1984			1
@entity60 ( left ) is powerless to stop @entity4 's howitzer at @entity51 on saturday lunchtime @entity2 players celebrate @entity4 's equalising goal , which rescued a point for the @entity2 late on seasons , both individually and collectively , can be transformed in such dramatic moments and so high was the quality of the goal , @entity65 labelled it the best he had seen at a live game			1
' we pushed up a little bit and there was an opportunity about five minutes before when i elected to pass and i thought if one comes across again i 'll swing one at it and thankfully the swinging worked , ' @entity4 said modestly			2
' it 's been a frustrating season so far and to go one - nil down and to keep knocking at the door the way we did shows tremendous character			2
a point is decent , we 'd have loved three			0
but we 've got to make sure we keep the character strong because right now we 're not picking up the right results			0
' @entity4 's performance , in front of @entity24 manager @entity89 , may go some way to restoring his international place @entity4 ( right ) admits he is no longer a starter in the @entity24 team , but his performance yesterday will have impressed @entity89 , sat observing in the @entity95 @entity2 did not play well yesterday but , at the back , the combination of @entity4 and @entity97 was solid and their respective performances would have been noted by @entity24 head coach @entity89 , who was sat observing in the @entity100			1
@entity4 accepts he is no longer a first choice for @entity24 , given he was dropped for the recent games against @entity103 and @entity104 , but if he keeps playing in this manner , both club and country will feel the benefit			1
this has to be a catalyst for revival			0
' we 've performed ok but the results have n't shown it , ' said @entity4			2
' so it 's about the lads to come out and keep playing the way we are and keep having the courage to do the right things and hopefully they 'll turn around			0
' he is proof of that			0
@entity4 ( centre ) heads for the degout as he celebrates with team - mates at @entity51			2

@entity4 has been in the firing line for both @entity2 's poor start to the season and @entity24 's @entity23 demise
the @entity2 captain has also been dropped from the @entity24 starting xi
@entity4 scored a 25 - year stunner against @entity28 on saturday
his goal , and performance , could prove to be a catalyst for @entity24 return
