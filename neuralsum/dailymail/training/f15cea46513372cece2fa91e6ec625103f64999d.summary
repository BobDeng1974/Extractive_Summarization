by @entity1 reporter published : 14:09 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 18:41 est , 7 january 2014 a retired couple have been forced to evacuate their home after a massive landslip engulfed their back garden			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were told to leave their home of 34 years near @entity12 , @entity13 , after the @entity14 tumbled towards the back of the property			1
hundreds of tons of earth , railings and asphalt slumped into their garden , destroying their gazebo and burying their shed			1
devastation : the aftermath of the landslide which has buried @entity9 and @entity10 's back garden at their home in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the retired couple evacuated the property out of fear that worse may be to come the couple are furious because nothing was done to shore up the road when cracks were first reported in it a year ago			1
@entity38 began in october , by which time the pavement had dropped by a foot			2
but then it was too little , too late			2
on @entity42 , @entity43 and mrs @entity10 heard an awful rumbling noise before earth and rocks came tumbling down the steep bank behind their back garden and towards their semi			1
it just missed their neighbours ' home			1
the couple are now staying with friends while @entity57 highways authority makes the area safe			1
the road , which runs from @entity60 to @entity61 , has been shut since the landslide			2
mrs @entity10 , 64 , said : ' we heard this awful rumbling noise			0
we found the bank in our garden and in next door ’s garden			0
it has just missed our neighbour by a few feet			0
' she added : ' it makes me nervous , wondering is any more going to fall down ? ' ' nervous ' : mr and mrs @entity10 in front of the bank where hundreds of tons of earth , railings and asphalt tumbled down towards their home on @entity42			1
they 're angry nothing was done to shore up the road before mr @entity85 , 63 , a former electrical engineer , is angry that the council did not act more quickly after cracks were first reported in the road more than a year ago			1
temporary traffic lights were installed to prevent traffic using the lane nearest the edge			0
but mr @entity85 said : ' my argument is that they knew about the problem for a long while			0
' if they had only carried out work earlier in the year , before the winter set in , i do n’t think it would have happened			2
' the cracks got worse			2
nothing happened until october and by this time the pavement had dropped by about a foot			0
there still seems to be little or no urgency			0
' @entity108 , @entity57 cabinet member for highways , said : ' we ’d begun work and had set ourselves realistic timescales that considered the possibility of bad weather			0
' we ’d planned to continue the work after the winter months had passed , if we ’d begun the work prior to the recent rainfall we ’d now be faced with further delays and the situation would be much worse			0
' as a result of the heavy rain we had to ask two households to stay with friends or relatives as a precautionary measure			0
