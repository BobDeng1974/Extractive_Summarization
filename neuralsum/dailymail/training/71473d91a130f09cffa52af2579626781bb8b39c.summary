by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:00 pm on 12th july 2011 @entity2 , @entity3 and his son @entity4 have been called to appear before a powerful commons committee next tuesday			2
@entity7 's @entity6 said mps wanted to ask mrs @entity2 about her knowledge of payments to the police			1
he said the @entity13 select committee also wants to quiz @entity14 on his involvement ' in authorising payments to silence ' @entity17 , chief executive of the @entity19 , after his phone was hacked			1
@entity3 owes the @entity22 family an apology , mr @entity6 added			0
questions : @entity3 and his @entity26 chief executive @entity2 , pictured today , have been invited to appear before the @entity13 select committee next tuesday mrs @entity2 is driven from @entity3 's @entity28 home earlier today under attack : @entity14 arrives at work in @entity31 , @entity28 , today			1
he has also been invited to answer questions at a parliamentary select committee @entity3 was urged to bow to the will of @entity35 today after it emerged that all three main parties are set to back a call for him to abandon his takeover bid for @entity40			1
the @entity41 and the @entity42 said they would be supporting a motion tabled by @entity7 leader @entity44 ( who met the family of murdered schoolgirl @entity46 today , below ) when it comes before @entity8 tomorrow			1
the text insists it is ' in the public interest for @entity3 and @entity51 to withdraw their bid for @entity40 '			1
mr @entity44 said : ' i welcome news that the government says it will support our motion			1
it is now for @entity3 to recognise the strength of public feeling and the will of all the major parties			0
' the development comes as the prime minister , his @entity42 deputy @entity42 and mr @entity44 prepare to hold talks this evening on the phone - hacking scandal			2
@entity7 has called a debate on the row on one of the regular @entity71 , when it has the opportunity to determine the subject for discussion on the floor of the @entity76			0
@entity51 's bid to buy the 61 per cent of shares in the satellite broadcaster which it does not already own was referred to the @entity81 by culture secretary @entity82 yesterday			1
support for the motion will give mr @entity82 more strength in sticking up for public opposition to the takeover , mr @entity44 said			1
he said : ' @entity82 will get a chance to make a decision about the public interest at the end of this process , once it comes back from the @entity81			0
' we think that if the @entity76 expresses a clear view about what is in the public interest - for the bid to be withdrawn - then that will help him in making the right call			2
' mr @entity82 is not expected to take part in the vote tomorrow			2
@entity103 's spokesman said the government was ' intending to support ' the call tomorrow			0
asked whether the government believed that @entity51 should heed the will of @entity35 , the spokesman replied : ' ultimately , that is a decision for @entity51 but we would always expect people to take seriously what @entity35 has said			2
' sources close to mr @entity42 confirmed that his @entity42 would also be voting in favour			0
the vote will follow the @entity118 debate tabled by @entity7			2
@entity3 owes the @entity22 family an apology , mr @entity6 added			0
he told @entity121 at one programme : ' they have misled @entity35 , egregiously , over time , they have misled the country and they have misled their readers and i think it is incumbent on mps to get to the facts			2
' asked whether the @entity130 trio would be compelled to attend , mr @entity6 said there was lots of ' arcane procedure ' to go through but added : ' we will be sitting next tuesday and we expect them to attend			1
' i suspect that some of them might be too cowardly to turn up but that is up to them to decide			0
' mr @entity6 , a leading campaigner on phone hacking , dismissed claims that the criminal investigation meant they would not be able to quiz the executives			2
' as far as i know the three individuals concerned are not the subject of a criminal investigation , none of them have been arrested , ' he added			0
' so it is not unreasonable for us to ask them why the information their senior executives gave us in a previous parliamentary inquiry was actually untrue			1
' @entity130 said today it would co-operate with the committee			1
a spokesman for @entity130 , publisher of the @entity161 , the @entity156 , the @entity157 and the @entity158 , could not confirm whether all three would attend the hearing			1
but the company said in a statement : ' we have been made aware of the request from the @entity13 committee to interview senior executives and will co-operate			1
we await the formal invitation			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity13 committee said it had submitted a ' polite request ' for the @entity130 executives to appear before it			1
if they refuse , mps could choose to ' compel ' @entity2 to give evidence , although it was unclear whether that action would be able to be taken against the @entity179 because they are not @entity26 citizens , she added			0
the committee could make a report to the @entity76 if witnesses continued to refuse to turn up and the speaker would then decide whether to refer the matter to the standards and @entity186 , which would decide if it wanted to investigate			0
the most likely punishment would be a fine but any action is rare and mps would be on ' untested ground ' , the spokeswoman added			0
@entity194 mp @entity193 , chair of the @entity195 , said : ' in light of the extraordinary developments this week around phone hacking , serious questions have arisen about the evidence given to the committee by a number of witnesses in its previous inquiry into press standards , libel and privacy			1
' in particular , @entity14 has said that @entity35 was misled			0
that is a very serious matter that we will not allow to go unquestioned			0
' we are therefore today calling @entity14 , @entity3 , and @entity2 to appear before us next week			0

three face questions from @entity195 select committee
@entity130 : we are aware of the request and will co-operate
no confirmation that three senior executives will attend
