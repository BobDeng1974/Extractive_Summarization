by @entity0 published : 13:10 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 19:07 est , 18 april 2013 two planets found around a distant star have been described as the most similar to @entity3 yet discovered			1
the planets in the newly found @entity6 system are made of rock and ice , and researchers believe they could contain water			1
kepler - 62e and kepler - 62d are among five new planets found within the ' habitable ' zone of a @entity16 - like star			1
the newly discovered planets named @entity18 - 62e and - f. , two of the five planets found around a far - off star have been described as the most similar to @entity3 yet discovered @entity23 ’s @entity18 mission has discovered two new planetary systems that include three super-earth - size planets in the ' habitable zone , ' the range of distance from a star where the surface temperature of an orbiting planet might be suitable for liquid water			1
the @entity6 system has five planets ; 62b , 62c , 62d , 62e and 62f			2
the kepler - 69 system has two planets ; 69b and 69c			2
kepler - 62e , 62f and 69c are the super-earth - size planets			1
two of the planets , named @entity18 - 62e and @entity42 , are rocky or made mostly of ice , and are believed to be the most likely to be earth ' doubles '			1
physicist professor @entity45 said : ' from what we can tell , from their radius and orbital period , these are the most similar objects to @entity3 that we have found yet			0
' they were identified by data from the @entity18 mission launched in 2009 to identify extrasolar planets			1
it has so far resulted in several dozen of some 3,000 ' @entity59 ' having been studied in detail but of those the ' five - planet system ' is the most important			0
@entity45 noticed a faint dot near @entity6 a year ago , leading to months of detailed study to confirm the planet interpretation			0
the discovery was made by astrophysicists at the @entity67			2
the findings were published in @entity69			0
researchers use fluctuations in the brightness of a star to identify the presence of a potential planet whose transit periodically dims the light of the star			0
@entity45 uses large ground - based telescopes to image the host star and analyzes the system to make sure other astronomical phenomena , such as nearby eclipsing binary stars , are not causing the fluctuation , a common ' false positive ' encountered in the research			2
' what really helped is that this star has five planets , ' he said			2
relative sizes of @entity93 habitable zone planets discovered : left to right : @entity94 , @entity93 - 69c , @entity18 - 62e , @entity18 - 62f , and @entity3 ( except for @entity3 , these are artists ' renditions ) ' you can mimic one planet with another event , but when you have five of them and they 're all periodic , that helps to put the nail in the coffin			1
' it 's hard to make that kind of signature with anything else that you can dream up			0
' @entity6 and the @entity111 the diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to @entity6 , a five - planet system about 1,200 light - years from @entity3 in the constellation @entity116 @entity18 , the second new system revealed today , a two - planet system about 2,700 light - years from @entity3 in the constellation @entity120			1
the two planets of kepler - 69 orbit a star that belongs to the same class as our sun , called g - type			2
the kepler space observatory , named after the 17th century @entity130 astronomer @entity93 , was launched on 7 march 2009 to survey a portion of the @entity132 for @entity3 - size planets that could harbour life			2
the research team used data from @entity23 's kepler space telescope , which simultaneously and continuously measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes			1
when a planet candidate transits , or passes , in front of the star from the spacecraft 's vantage point , a percentage of light from the star is blocked			2
this causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet 's size relative to its star			2
the size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet 's size accurately			2
to learn more about the properties of the stars , scientists examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface of the star			0
they probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure of @entity3			0
the science is called asteroseismology			0
the sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface			0
the waves cause oscillations that @entity18 observes as a rapid flickering of the star 's brightness			1
like bells in a steeple , small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones			0
the barely discernible , high - frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure			0
this is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. @entity197 , a @entity198 of @entity199 associate professor of astronomy , identified @entity42 , a small , probably rocky planet orbiting a sunlike star in the @entity116 constellation			1
the planet is about 1.4 times the size of @entity3 , receives about half as much solar flux , or heat and radiation , as @entity3 and circles its star in 267.3 ( @entity3 ) days			0
it 's one of two " super-earth " planets discovered in the star @entity6 's habitable zone , that swath of space the right distance from the star to potentially allow liquid water to exist on a planet 's surface , thus giving life a chance			1
a super-earth is a planet greater in mass than our own but still smaller than gas giants such as @entity229			0
@entity93 62 's other super-earth , nearby 62e , is 1.61 times @entity3 's size , circles the star in 122.4 days and gets about 20 percent more stellar flux than the @entity3			2
the two are the smallest exoplanets — planets outside the solar system — yet found in a host star 's habitable zone			1
' the planets this small that we have found until now have been very close to their stars and much too hot to be possibly habitable			2
the artist 's concept depicts @entity245 , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun , located about 1,200 light - years from @entity3 in the constellation @entity116			1
@entity245 orbits it 's host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger than @entity3 in size			2
scientists do not know if kepler - 62e is a waterworld or if it has a solid surface , but its discovery signals another step closer to finding a world similar to @entity3			1
@entity18 - 62f , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun , located about 1,200 light - years from @entity3 in the constellation @entity116			1
@entity42 orbits it 's host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than @entity3 in size			1
the size of kepler - 62f is known , but its mass and composition are not			0
however , based on previous exoplanet discoveries of similar size that are rocky , scientists are able to determine its mass by association			0
the artist 's concept depicts @entity274 , a super-earth - size planet in the habitable zone of a star like our sun , located about 2,700 light - years from @entity3 in the constellation @entity120			1
kepler - 69c , is 70 percent larger than the size of @entity3 , and is the smallest yet found to orbit in the habitable zone of a sun - like star			1
astronomers are uncertain about the composition of kepler - 69c , but its orbit of 242 days around a sun - like star resembles that of our neighboring planet @entity290			0
' this is the first one @entity93 has found in the habitable zone that satisfies this small size , " @entity197 said			1
' @entity42 is the smallest size and the most promising distance from its star , which by these measures makes it the most similar exoplanet to @entity3 that has been found by @entity18			1
' @entity303 is the second author of a paper documenting the discovery published april 18 by @entity307 , the online edition of the journal @entity310			0
while the sizes of @entity245 and 62f are known , @entity197 said , their mass and densities are not — but every planet found in their size range so far has been rocky , like @entity3			0
' based on its size , our best guess is that it 's rocky and has some atmosphere , but not a thick gaseous envelope , like @entity229 , ' @entity197 said			0
the @entity18 telescope was launched in 2009 with the aim of finding earthlike planets beyond the solar system			1
it detects planets by ' transits ' that cause their host stars to appear fainter when the planets pass in front as they orbit			0
kepler 62f was a late - arrival in terms of its discovery			0
its planetary siblings were found by a team of researchers led by @entity344 of the @entity345 , principal investigator for the @entity346			0
@entity6 b , c and d are 1.31 , 0.54 and 1.95 times the size of the @entity3 , respectively , but orbit the star too close to be in the habitable zone			1
' this type of discovery is the reason we launched the @entity18 spacecraft — to find small , @entity3 - sized , potentially @entity3 - temperature planets , " @entity197 said			1
' at the same time , though , it is n't exactly the same as @entity3			0
' it is slightly larger and cooler than @entity3			0
' it tells me how special the @entity3 is and how it may take some time — hopefully not too long — to find its exact twin			0

discovery of five new planets made by @entity23 's @entity18 telescope
two of the planets , named named @entity18 - 62e and @entity42 , are rocky or made mostly of ice
all five are within the ' habitable ' zone of a @entity16 - like star
