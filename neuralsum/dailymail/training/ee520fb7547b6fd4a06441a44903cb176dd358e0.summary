@entity1 's win over @entity2 this weekend was routine , but @entity1 striker @entity3 will do well to remember it after a brutal clothesline left him out cold			1
in a move more commonly seen in the wrestling ring , @entity2 's @entity6 was challenging for a 50/50 ball with @entity3 , when his flailing arm caught the face of the @entity1 forward and left him unconscious on the turf			1
immediately after the incident , @entity6 is seen desperately calling for medical attention when he realises @entity3 is unconscious			0
the referee deemed the incident a yellow - card offence , despite the fact @entity3 would have been clear on goal had he gone past @entity6			2
@entity1 doctors shortly after decided that @entity3 was unfit to carry on , and the striker was substituted directly after the incident			0
@entity1 , who were 1 - 0 up at the time of the knock - out blow , went on to win 3 - 0 and maintained their 100 % win record in the @entity27 this season , scoring 13 and only conceding 1 goal			0
ouch : @entity3 , after beating @entity6 to the ball , is caught by the @entity32 's right arm clothesline : @entity3 would have been through on goal had he not been hit out cold : the 27 - year - old striker was left unconscious on the turf after the blow to his face attention : @entity6 , the referee , and various other players were quick to call for medical attention			2

the game was *marred* by a *ruthless* clothesline on @entity3
the @entity50 striker was challenging for a 50/50 ball with @entity6
@entity6 's flailing arm caught @entity3 and left him out cold on the turf
