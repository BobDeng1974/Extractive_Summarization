are you of the opinion that prostitution should be legal in the @entity7 ?
do you have a personal or religious aversion to pornography that would make it difficultto listen to the law and evidence and render a fair and impartial **verdict** ?
you may be shown explicit videos and photographs depicting individuals engaged *ingraphic* sexual acts . would viewing this evidence make it difficult for you to listen to thelaw and evidence and render a fair and impartial **verdict** ?
**adultery** is **defined** as having sex with another person who is not your spouse ; it is not *acrime* . prostitution is **defined** as having or *offering* to have sex with another person *formoney* . if the evidence shows that *defendant* @entity36 committed **adultery** @entity50 , would that fact alone make it difficult for you to find him not *guilty* of *thecrime* of @entity185 ?
