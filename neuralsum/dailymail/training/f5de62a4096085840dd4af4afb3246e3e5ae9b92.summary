' i then started to have bleeds from 27 weeks , which doctors warned me about , but every single one was heart - rending as i thought i was losing my baby			2
' as a precaution , doctors decided to keep her in hospital for the last eight weeks of the pregnancy , or until the baby was born , for both of their safety			0

' a few hours later i was taken down to theatre and put under while they delivered @entity10			0
