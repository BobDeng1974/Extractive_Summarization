@entity0 has declared that he does n't care where @entity1 win the @entity3 , so long as they end up claiming the title			1
the @entity5 lead the table by six points , with a game in hand , and face @entity10 at home on saturday in the first of their final nine games of the season			1
' i dont care if it is in the hotel or away or at home , i just want to win it , ' said @entity0 , as @entity1 trained at @entity20 on friday			1
@entity0 was speaking at @entity1 's press conference ahead of their @entity3 clash @entity23 will start for @entity1 against @entity10 on saturday following a tiring international break @entity0 ( right ) watches as his players @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 train ' in any occasion i think the club who wins it gets the trophy in our last match at home , and our last game of the season is at home ( to @entity40 )			1
' so if we win the title we get the trophy at our house			1
but i do n't care , even if somebody loses the trophy and we do n't get it i am happy with that			2
i just want to win it			2
' @entity0 will start @entity23 against @entity10 on saturday despite the player suggesting he is tired			1
the @entity50 said earlier this week he is feeling weary as the season reaches its climax			2
but the @entity1 manager , who also confirmed @entity54 has recovered from a hamstring injury , will not take his wing wizard out of the firing line against the @entity58			1
@entity23 started both of @entity62 's @entity61 qualifiers during the international break			1
@entity1 goalkeeper @entity64 gets down to his left to make a save in training @entity68 ( left ) battles team - mate @entity69 ( centre ) for the ball @entity1 midfielder @entity72 attempts a pass under pressure from team - mate @entity75 ' hazard is tired because he played two matches in three days , ' said @entity0			1
' he travelled and did n't sleep because he arrived in @entity62 at 5 or 6 in the morning after playing in @entity78			1
we think he can recover in these couple of days , but he plays tomorrow ( saturday )			2
that 's what a season is like for a player who is important for both his club and national team			2
i want to play him every time and the coach of his country wants to play him every time			0
' he is a team player that plays with the ball , creates , dribbles and players with lots of intensity so it is not a surprise that he can be a bit tired			2
but i believe in him , the team and his ambition to play			0
' and i believe in his desire to help the team reach their season objective , so i will start with him			2
' hazard ( left ) in action for @entity62 against @entity78 during their @entity61 qualifying win on tuesday hazard started both games for @entity62 during the international break , but was subbed off in both @entity113 striker @entity54 missed the international break with injury , but could yet feature against @entity10 at @entity116 on saturday evening after training for the last couple of days			1
however @entity0 refused to confirm whether his top scorer would start the game			1
' @entity54 trained on thursday and friday with the group , ' continued @entity0			1
' he is not injured but i do n't know if i will start with him or not			2
i need to analyse the situation with him and make a decision			0
' ' he dedicated himself to getting fit on his days off , working hard in the morning and afternoon			0
we can say that we did all the tests and scans to confirm that scientifically at this moment the muscle is fine			0
' but in football you need the confidence to know you are free to express maximum intensity , and that 's our doubt			0
so we 'll see in the next 24 hours then decide			0
' @entity1 's @entity134 ( second left ) , @entity27 ( second right ) and @entity26 ( right ) train on friday @entity54 ( centre ) is back in training but could not be fit enough to start against @entity10 @entity54 vies for the ball with fellow @entity1 striker @entity140 ( left ) at @entity20 @entity142 's @entity141 still have a chance of winning the league , according to @entity0 although they sit six points clear at the top of the league with a game in hand on all their nearest rivals , @entity0 still believes that there is still a four - horse race for the title this season			1
' look at the points difference , ' he said			0
' you have to say four ( teams ) now			0
not five , because there 's a gap from fourth to fifth and , with eight matches to go , that 's a difficult gap from first to fifth			0
' but the points difference between second , third and fourth makes me think and feel that they are there			0
' he added : ' we need six victories and one draw from nine matches			0
it is a good situation for us , and one all the other clubs would like to have			0
but it 's pure mathematics			0
we need to win six matches and draw one			0
we need to do that , and we have n't done it yet			0
' and despite @entity141 's inconsistency this season , @entity0 still believes @entity142 's side are still in with a shot at the title			1
' the number of the points is the number of points , ' @entity0 added			1
in the last few matches they 've become consistent in results and the quality of their performances			0
