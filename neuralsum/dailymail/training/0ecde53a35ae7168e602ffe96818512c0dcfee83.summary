by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 20 november 2013 you would not be the only one thinking @entity2 is back when looking at this creepy gathering of demon - children , a possessed little girl and adults with vacant stares			2
however , this is not a an @entity10 holiday snap , but the official portrait of three generations of the @entity14 royal family			1
the painting of queen @entity19 , her two sons and their families has been accused of bearing a closer resemblance to a horror film poster than a royal portrait			2
the royal @entity10 family : from left to right are : princess @entity24 , crown prince @entity25 holding prince @entity26 , princess @entity27 holding princess @entity28 , queen @entity19 , @entity29 , queen @entity19 's husband @entity30 , prince henrik - son of @entity33 , princess @entity34 holding @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 from @entity33 's first marriage and last - but not least - prince @entity33 ' is the @entity39 starring in a sequel to @entity41 ? , ' one @entity43 user posted in response to the image			1
the portrait sees the young @entity29 , second in line to the @entity14 throne , stand in the foreground with visible bags underneath his eyes and an eerie glow around him			1
next to him , on the floor , sits his sister @entity24 , who has been turned from her normal adorable cherub - self into a creepy come - alive doll creature with blue - brown lips , rubbing her hands			1
in the background on the right are crown prince @entity25 and his @entity63 wife @entity27 , holding their two youngest - twins @entity64 and @entity24			2
left are @entity33 and his @entity68 princess @entity34 , holding their young daughter @entity35			0
both wives are staring at their children , while their husbands take a regal stand and stare into the distance , a rather unconventional interpretation of the role of a woman in a country proud to be one of the world ’s most gender neutral nations			0
in a better light : from left to right are prince @entity33 , his sons @entity37 and prince @entity36 , queen @entity19 , crown prince @entity25 holding @entity29 , and @entity27 , in 2006 creepy dolls : adorable @entity86 and @entity24 , pictured with their parents in 2007 , have been made to look more like the children of the undead in the portrait the only three to have eye contact with the viewer are the @entity19 , @entity25 and @entity29 as current or future rulers of @entity14			1
on the floor playing with @entity14 's pride and joy - @entity96 - are prince @entity37 and prince @entity36 , the two sons from prince @entity33 's first marriage to @entity100 - born briton @entity99 , now countess @entity99			2
the @entity96 is said to symbolise the two young boys rebuilding their lives following their parents divorce			0
the couple standing in the ruins in the background is the painter @entity108 and his wife			0
responsible : artist @entity111 , who painted himself into the picture , with his new portrait of the @entity39 displayed at the @entity114 in @entity14 ‘ it is a bit creepy with the children , but that disappears when you have studied the image for a while , ’ ’ art expert @entity115 told @entity116			1
‘ it is an interesting image which is party very photographic but which has borrowed light and colour from @entity129 17th century painting			0
‘ the first thing which hits me is that you can see the @entity19 ’s hands very clearly displayed , and it is traditionally so , that royals show them to show their decisiveness			0
’ @entity14 is one of the oldest @entity139 royal families on register and have been ruled by the same house since 1448 .			0
