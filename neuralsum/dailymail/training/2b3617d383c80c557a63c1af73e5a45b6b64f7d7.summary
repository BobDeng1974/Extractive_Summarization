@entity6 from @entity7 , @entity8 , allowed @entity9 to sign ' @entity10 ' over her face in giant @entity13 script on the day they met the pair - who 'd met on an online chat room - say they quickly fell ' head over heels in love ' and soon after met in @entity20 , @entity8 , where they decided to get married			1
' it 's a symbol of our eternal devotion			1
i 'd like him to tattoo every inch of my body , " she said			1
' all for @entity10 , ' she posted on her @entity51 today next to a big pink heart			0
and now @entity6 who has already taken @entity6 ’s name despite only being engaged since january 20 is learning to tattoo under his tutorship			0
' their plans for a life together include her learning to tattoo while she also gets the full - body ink that she ’s always dreamed of and of course a family , ' said a friend of @entity39			2
he added : ' i know that there are people who are terrified that @entity67 has made a rash decision that she ’ll regret horribly , but sometimes the best decisions are the ones you make in an instant with your heart rather than the ones long - debated in your mind			2
friends of @entity6 have flooded her with messages praising the artwork and how beautiful she looks			0
' you must be so happy that you can wear that tattoo			0
it looks great , ' wrote @entity82			0
even the style of the name fits your face well , ' wrote another			2
mr @entity87 's handiwork hit the headlines in 2009 after he tattooed 56 stars across an 18 - year - old 's face who then lied and accused him of inking her when she was asleep			1
mr @entity87 fled @entity94 after the scandal caused by @entity96 in 2009			1
she lied to her family and reporters and claimed that she had asked mr @entity87 for just three stars near her eye			1
freshly inked : @entity102 at the age of 18 in 2009 , shortly after she asked tattooist @entity9 to cover her face in black stars as her regret sank in , she claimed he kept adding more and more after she fell asleep at the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity94			1
she promised to sue the tattooist for the cost of removal , claiming a language barrier meant the @entity115 speaker had misunderstood when she gave instructions in @entity117 and @entity118			0
miss @entity102 said she avoided going out in public because the tattoos made her feel like a ' freak '			0
but a week later she confessed to a @entity123 tv station that she had been awake throughout and had indeed asked for the full 56 marks			0
she said she lied because she was afraid of how her father would react			0
even still , mr @entity87 - whose own face is covered in tattoos and piercings - offered to pay half the cost of laser removal , saying he did not want to leave a customer unsatisfied			1
he later retracted this offer , leaving miss @entity102 to cover the cost alone			0
though laser treatment has been shown to be a effective way of removing ink , even the most advanced technology would leave white marks across her face .			2
