by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 16:56 est , 24 may 2013 @entity2 came within six hours of running out of gas earlier this year , it emerged yesterday			2
the severe winter weather coupled with a faulty import pipeline led to supplies being rapidly used up at the end of march			1
the revelation that the country almost ran out of gas came as officials warned there could be a similar crisis next winter			1
household fuel bills , already at record levels , are expected to rise further as a result of the shortage			2
@entity18 , director of energy and infrastructure at the @entity21 , the property portfolio managed by the @entity23 , said : ‘ we really only had six hours ’ worth of gas left in storage as a buffer [ at the end of march ]			1
if it had run any lower it would have meant interruptions to supply			1
’ the @entity21 owns the rights to gas storage sites under the seabed			2
with continuing cold weather – this spring is expected to be the coldest since 1979 – reserves could be partly empty heading into next winter			1
this could force energy companies to buy gas on the open market at a higher cost , which would likely be passed on via household bills			1
with eight of the @entity2 ’s coal plants shut down last month to meet @entity47 diktats , the nation will be left relying on wind farms and imported gas for power			0
@entity51 , an independent energy analyst , said : ‘ this wo n’t trigger price rises immediately , but if it causes companies to spend more buying gas over the winter then [ energy firms ] will definitely recoup their costs later on			1
’ the @entity58 , which pipes gas around the @entity2 , insisted the @entity2 has ' substantial resilience ' and diverse supply sources including imports of liquefied natural gas he added : ‘ this is most likely to be felt over the next two or three winters as prices creep higher			1
’ @entity68 , utilities analyst at stockbroker @entity69 , said it would be likely to have a ‘ significant ’ impact on wholesale gas prices			0
it comes only days after energy giant @entity74 , @entity2 ’s second biggest power firm , warned that a price hike of £ 80 was ‘ highly likely ’ for its customers because of rising costs			1
leaked documents seen by the @entity79 , which come from within a government body , assessed the impact of the gas crunch in march			0
the document revealed energy firms had to start drawing on emergency gas reserves , which are said to be more volatile than standard gas , after supplies dwindled to almost nothing			2
companies make money by buying gas cheaply in the summer , putting it into gas stores , and selling it in the winter			0
but summer prices have been rising , and the difference with winter rates is now so small that it is not economical for investors to build any new gas stores – leaving @entity2 with a maximum of 20 days of storage			0
this compares with more than 100 days in @entity103 , 92 days in @entity104 and 70 days in @entity105			0
the @entity106 protects itself against gas shortages by storing contingencies for up to six months			0
it also emerged that the number of ships bringing liquefied natural gas from @entity113 – the @entity2 ’s other main source of gas – has halved in the last 12 months			0
these ships , which are the most expensive way to get gas , take more than two weeks to reach @entity2			0
it was only because one arrived at the end of march that @entity2 avoided gas shortages , experts believe .			0

' if it had run any lower it would have meant interruptions to supply , ' he said
