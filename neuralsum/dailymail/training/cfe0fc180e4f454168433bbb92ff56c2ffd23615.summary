students at the @entity3 , @entity17 , are learning how to write computer viruses , hack networks , crack passwords and mine data from a range of digital devices			1
the little - known @entity25 programme already places 85 per cent of its graduates with the @entity14 - known to students as ' the fraternity - or the @entity8 - which they call ' the sorority '			1
@entity31 , an @entity32 immigrant to the @entity33 , founded the programme at @entity3 's @entity35 in 1998 and continues to lead the teaching , the @entity30 reported			1
students are taught with a mixture of classroom theory and practical field work , he said , with each assigned to a police crime lab on campus to apply their skills to help recover evidence from digital devices			2
' i throw them into the deep end , ' mr @entity31 told the @entity30			0
' and they become fearless			0
' much of their work involves gathering evidence against paedophiles , with several students having posed as children on the internet to lure predators into stings			2
but his students in 2003 also helped solve a triple murder case by cracking an email account that linked the killer with his victims and , working alongside the @entity15 , they have developed new techniques for extracting data from damged smartphones , gps devices and other digital devices			1
the @entity14 in may named @entity3 as one of four centres of academic excellence in cyber operations , alongside @entity74 in @entity75 , the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81			1
@entity82 , a senior @entity14 official who visited the school recently , told @entity30 : ' @entity3 students show up to @entity14 with a lot of highly relevant hands - on experience			1
' there are very few schools that are like @entity3 in terms of having participation with law enforcement , with industry , with government			2
' centre of excellence : @entity3 was in may named by the @entity14 alongside four other schools as important centres for training cyber-security operatives new eavesdropping technology could allow government agencies to ' silently record ' conversations on internet chat services like @entity104 in real time			1
until now , so called voice over internet protocol ( @entity109 ) services have been difficult for police to tap into , because of the way they send information over the web			0
the services convert analogue audio signals into digital data packets , which are then sent in a way that is costly and complex for third parties to intercept			2
but now a @entity78 businessman has obtained a patent for a ' legal intercept ' technology he says ' would allow governments to " silently record " voip communications '			0
@entity126 , president of @entity127 , an chat service similar to @entity104 , claims his system would allow authorities to identify and monitor suspects merely by accessing their username and subscriber data			0
applicants to @entity3 's programme , who have ranged in age from 17 to 63 , must be @entity33 citizens eligible for security clearance of ' top secret ' or higher			1
many are military veterans or others looking to start second careers , usually people who are working towards degrees in computer science , engineering , law or business			0
some two - thirds become what mr @entity31 calls ' cyber ninjas ' , with a cyber-operations certificate attached to their diplomas that identifies them , in mr @entity31 's words , as ' super techie '			0
the success of the @entity3 course comes as @entity33 authorities scramble to beef up their protection against hacker infiltration			2
defence secretary @entity161 admitted last month the @entity162 already spends more than $ 3billion each year on cyber-security , the @entity30 reported			0
in an october 11 speech , quoted by the @entity30 , he warned : ' an aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains , or trains loaded with lethal chemicals			0
' they could contaminate the water supply in major cities , or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country			0

@entity3 's @entity25 programme is training students to write viruses , hack networks , crack passwords and mine data
