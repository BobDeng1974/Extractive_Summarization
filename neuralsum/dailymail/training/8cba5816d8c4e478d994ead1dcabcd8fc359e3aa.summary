by @entity0 while it ’s entirely possible to fake feelings while awake , you ca n’t fake anything when you ’re asleep			1
recent research shows the way you sleep together reveals clues about your true emotions and state of your relationship			1
it makes sense when you think about it : the closer you are , the closer you ’re likely to sleep			1
if you fear someone ’s about to leave you , chances are you 'll cling on tight			0
@entity0 says that the closer you are as a couple , the closer you are likely to be in bed if you 're the one thinking of leaving , you ’ll create distance between you			1
@entity22 professor @entity21 recently asked more than 1000 people to describe their favourite sleeping position and rate the quality of their relationship			1
his results match earlier @entity29 research			0
do you fall asleep entwined in a full - body cuddle ? or is it more a case of edge - of - the - bed balancing to avoid the accidental brush of skin against skin ? here 's the verdict on your sleeping style			1
@entity0 says that if we distance ourselves physically in bed , it could be a sign that we are emotionally distant when we 're awake you sleep face to face , every part touching you do it : the pose of new lovers smack in the middle of the @entity49 - ca n't - believe - i 've - found - you bit			1
it shows a desire to connect on all levels , a need for reassurance ( by hanging on possessively , they ca n't run away ) and a total commitment to each other and the relationship			2
if you ’re still doing it years in , however , there ’s a hint of @entity65 co-dependency ( not a bad idea to un-velcro your hips now and then )			0
you do n't : panic not			0
this is the least favourite position of all with only four percent of couples claiming to like it			2
i say ' claim ' because , seriously , who can sleep like this ? who does n't worry their breath will smell ( or their partner ’s ) , that they 'll dribble or snore or open their eyes to see their partner looking aghast because they ’ve seen your ' sleeping face ' ? ( my latest paranoia having recently slept and woken face to face with a mirror , worst fears realized			2
) sleeping trapped in your lover 's arms is blissful initially			0
but it 's totally impractical if you want to move or itch , your arm goes dead , you ’re overcome by claustrophobia , have a hot flush or the beans you ate earlier start fermenting			0
@entity96 says it is harder to disguise our feelings when we 're asleep , so where you and your partner lie in your bed could say a lot about your relationship you sleep ' spooned ' - one of you on your side , the other snuggled up behind you do it : this is the classic ' happy couple ' position - you 're both loving and want to be physically close			1
thirty - one percent of couples sleep facing the same direction			1
you do n't : if it 's not sweltering hot and / or it ’s the ' bean thing ' again ( see above ) , how 's your sex life ? few couples hug or spoon during sleep if they ’re sexually frustrated or resentful			1
the partner who ’s not eager for sex is worried any sign of affection will be interpreted as an invitation , the other gets the message any touch is unwelcome so stops trying			0
you sleep back to back but your bottoms touch you do it : this is the most popular position ( 42 % prefer sleeping back to back )			2
most studies suggest it 's far more comfortable to sleep solo , yet few dispute the joy of sleeping with someone you love			2
@entity0 calls sleeping at opposite ends of the bed the ' pre-divorce ' position this is a good compromise and a sign you ’re in good shape			1
when awake , you ’re likely to be affectionate and not afraid of intimacy but not overly needy either			0
you do n't : the critical point here is n't so much if your bottoms touch but how far away they are			0
if it ’s less than an inch , relax			0
eighty - six percent of couples in the survey who slept less than an inch away were happy in their relationships			2
the real danger is when you ’re inching into the next category … you both sleep on the edge of the bed , facing in opposite directions you do it : this is the post-argument or pre-divorce position			1
lots of space between you during sleep usually translates to emotional distance during waking hours			2
if one or both of your arms cross over your body , you 're protecting yourself emotionally by subliminally covering your heart			0
only two percent of couples sleep over 30 inches apart ( though possibly another question that should have been asked is ' how big is your bed ? ' ) you do n't : if you seriously are so far apart from each other , you ’re threatening to fall out of the bed , you 're at the ' skin crawl ' stage			1
the relationship 's not just over , repulsion has set in			0
but if there ’s only a few inches between you , it could mean you both simply like a bit of space or have different ' resting ' body temperatures ( one of you would overheat in the deep freeze , the other shiver in the @entity190			0
) but whatever your position , turns out the bottom line is n’t so much where your bottoms are or whether limbs entwine but how often you touch during the night			0
ninety - four percent of the happiest couples were those who reached out a foot or a hand , exchanged a word , a kiss or reassuring caress ( a fallout of being glued to the @entity203 trial - to check you ’re both still there and alive and kicking )			0
