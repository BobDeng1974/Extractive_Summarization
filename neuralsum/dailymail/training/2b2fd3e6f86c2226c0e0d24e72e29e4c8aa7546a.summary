by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today insisted he had never considered quitting despite leading the @entity3 into an election bloodbath , losing all but one of the party ’s @entity6			1
in a near wipeout at the ballot box , the @entity8 @entity3 lost 11 of its 12 seats in @entity12 , after mr @entity2 campaigned hard as the leader of the ‘ party of in ’			1
but in an apparently emotional interview this afternoon , mr @entity2 insisted the ‘ gutting ’ result had not led him to consider is position , vowing instead to ‘ finish the job ’			1
@entity3 leader @entity2 refused to resign after the ' gutting ' election results saw all but one of the party 's @entity6 ousted the @entity3 slumped to fifth place in the national share of the vote – to just 7 per cent , behind the @entity26			1
after starting the night with 12 meps , the party was reduced to a rump of just one - @entity30 in the @entity31			1
while jubilant @entity32 celebrated stunning victory – topping the poll and securing 24 @entity6 - the @entity3 were plunged into fresh turmoil with mr @entity2 clinging to his job			1
his high stakes gamble to take on mr @entity38 in two head - to - head tv debates appears to have dramatically backfired			0
speaking from @entity3 headquarters in central @entity41 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ it did n't work but it was right that we stood up for the values we believe in			1
‘ i 'm immensely proud to lead the most united , resilient and toughest party in @entity48 politics			0
' % share of the vote with 11 of the 12 regions of the @entity48 declared , @entity32 has gained 11 seats , with @entity52 up seven , the @entity53 down seven and the @entity3 down 10 mr @entity2 went on : ‘ we made a big commitment to the @entity48 people in 2010 to step up to the plate , to form a government , to reform and repair the damaged @entity48 economy and to deliver policy after policy after policy that the @entity3 have been campaigning on for generations			1
that is what we must continue to do			0
we must finish the job			2
’ " f i thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership ... then i would n't hesitate advocating it " pitching the @entity3 as the true voice of @entity8 politics in @entity48 , mr @entity2 saw his meps wiped			1
around 250 @entity3 – including candidates , councillors and mps – have signed a letter calling for him to resign			1
mr @entity2 went on : ‘ if i thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership , changing strategy , changing approaches , bailing out now , changing direction , then i would n't hesitate advocating it			2
’ asked if he has a bunker mentality , he replied : ‘ no , not at all ’ , adding : ‘ i 'm never going to put myself ahead of the @entity3			2
’ in the popular share of the vote the @entity3 slumped to just 6.87 per cent , barely half what it achieved in 2009			2
@entity3 president @entity87 said it would be ' foolish ' to oust mr @entity2 , but some party members want @entity89 to take charge ahead of the 2015 general election @entity3 mp @entity92 has called for @entity89 to take over as leader to stem the loss of public support @entity3 president @entity87 said the results were ' as bad as i feared ' as it faced losing all of its meps			1
treasury minister @entity101 added : ' it has been a pretty awful night for the @entity3			2
' but former mp @entity103 said the @entity3 brand had become ‘ toxic ’			0
@entity3 mp @entity92 said he wanted business secretary @entity89 to take over as leader , warning that a fundamental cause of the @entity3 ' ‘ abysmal ’ showing was the fact that voters were no longer willing to listen to mr @entity2			2
if we carry on as usual , we are like the generals at the @entity114 , because these losses are horrendous , ’ the @entity111 mp told the @entity116			0
‘ given the scale of the losses , to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous			0
’ mr @entity2 rejected the criticism : ‘ of course , it is right to have searching questions in the wake of such a bad set of election results , but if i 'm honest the easiest thing in politics , just as in life , sometimes when the going gets really tough is just to walk away , to wash your hands of it			0
i 'm not going to do that and my party is not going to do that			0
‘ at the point when our big decisions , our big judgments are being vindicated , we are not going to buckle , we are not going to lose our nerve			0
we are not going to walk away			0
‘ we must argue over and over and over again that if it was n't for the @entity3 taking that brave decision at considerable short - term cost ... we would n't have a recovery now and more than that you would n't have the kind of recovery			0
‘ there 's just no way the conservatives left to their own devices could deliver the big changes			0

@entity3 collapse to 7 % of the vote , losing 11 out of 12 meps
mps and councillors back calls for change of leadership to *reverse* decline
but @entity2 says he has not considered resigning but will ' finish the job '
