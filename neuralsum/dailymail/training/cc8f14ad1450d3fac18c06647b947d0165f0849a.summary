by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:18 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:40 est , 31 december 2013 @entity0 is a @entity3 football writer , columnist and tv pundit			0
@entity6 could have chosen to pay respect to @entity8			0
instead , he chose @entity9			0
to celebrate his first goal in @entity13 since august 20 , 2011 , @entity11 ’s @entity3 striker decided to express his support and friendship for a @entity3 so - called humorist by doing the provocative hand gesture , la quenelle			1
@entity6 has tried to portray his actions as an innocent anti-establishment action but just think about the timing			0
controversy : this gesture , performed by @entity24 and @entity6 , has landed the striker in hot water in the latest sickening episode involving @entity9 , he made these comments on stage about @entity30 , a @entity3 radio journalist : ‘ when i hear him ( @entity30 ) , i tell myself , you know , gas chamber			1
’ after a video emerged of the incident , the @entity3 government issued a statement saying it would take every legal action possible to ban @entity9 ’s shows and public meetings in the future			2
this story was headline news in the @entity3 media on the morning of @entity11 ’s match against @entity47 , which was shown live on @entity48 in @entity3			1
in the past two days , the vast majority of the @entity3 public have expressed disgust at his actions but a minority of @entity3 citizens still believe la quenelle is anti-zionist — and not anti-semitic			2
these people have used the internet and @entity58 to paint @entity9 and @entity6 as victims of the political and media worlds			1
flashpoint : @entity6 performed the celebration after scoring for @entity11 at @entity64 @entity6 ’s supporters ask why @entity3 society and the government did not react with similar outrage when la quenelle was made by @entity71 ’s @entity70 , judo world champion @entity72 and @entity3 - born basketball star @entity73 — who last night apologised for making the gesture			1
an important distinction is that these gestures were made in private , not a sporting arena			0
they also ask why nothing happened when @entity81 , a @entity3 ligue 1 player from @entity82 , did la quenelle on the field after scoring last january ? by making his gesture on the pitch , @entity6 knew that in @entity3 the reaction would be huge			1
was n’t the political climate heavy enough ? his action was also provocative towards @entity13 football ’s rulers and @entity92 , who prohibit expression of political , social or religious issues on the football stage			2
shock : a picture of @entity98 performing the same move emerged as did one of basketball star @entity73 they were also provocative in the context of a @entity3 society which is focusing on the integration debate			1
months before the local and @entity106 elections are held , the @entity107 looks as if they could become the largest political party in @entity3 in terms of voters			2
unemployment and immigration are among the most sensitive themes in the political campaign			2
despite the bitter atmosphere in @entity3 around these questions for many years now , @entity9 remained in a relative shadow and was regarded as an underground agitator			0
even if he claims to have around 426,000 ' likes ' on @entity119 and 43,000 followers on @entity58 , @entity9 and his quenelle had not received a significant public airing			1
now , thanks to @entity6 , it is on the front pages in @entity3 and is being discussed by everyone			0
@entity9 could not have wished for better publicity for his views			0
@entity6 portrays himself as an anti-establishment hero but this is an anti-establishment hero who is pictured emerging from his @entity132 at the entrance to @entity134 and has appeared in an advert in @entity3 for the hamburger restaurant chain ‘ quick ’			0
picking up the pieces : @entity11 caretaker boss @entity139 has been left to pick up the pieces when @entity11 striker @entity6 scored the first of his two goals in saturday 's 3 - 3 @entity144 draw at @entity47 , he celebrated by making a gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of @entity13 football			1
but the salute , known in @entity3 as ' la quenelle ' , is the subject of a fierce national debate that has reached the @entity3 interior ministry and stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across @entity6 's homeland			0
here , we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of its self - proclaimed inventor , the stand - up comedian and political activist @entity9 :			1
