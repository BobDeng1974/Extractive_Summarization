@entity29 confirmed its original decision in january , rejecting an appeal by the drug ’s manufacturers @entity35			2
but cancer charities said the decision could mean a postcode lottery and effectively prevent thousands of men from accessing life - extending treatment			2
each year around 37,000 men in the @entity43 are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease			0
it is the second most common cause of cancer death in men , accounting for 13 per cent			0
