@entity0 , who paid back £ 43,000 after admitting dodging rail fares , has been banned from working in the financial industry a high - flying @entity4 executive who paid back nearly £ 43,000 after he was caught dodging rail fares has been banned from the financial industry			1
@entity0 , who reportedly earned £ 1 million a year , admitted his behaviour was ' foolish ' saying the ban came after an unblemished 20 - year career			1
mr @entity0 left his job as a managing director of @entity12 earlier this year after it emerged he dodged fares during his trip from the rural station of @entity16 , @entity17 to @entity18 , central @entity19			1
he was today banned by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) from performing any function in the industry it regulates ' for not being fit and proper ' after the fare dodging , which was believed to have taken place over five years			1
@entity25 - driving @entity0 owns two huge , mortgage - free mansions in the @entity17 countryside – a £ 1million house near @entity29 and his impressive home near the village of @entity16 , which he bought for £ 2.7million in 2011			2
he shares the @entity33 property – which boasts acres of landscaped grounds , ponds and a tennis court – with his wife @entity38 and their young child in an isolated spot not far from @entity16 station @entity43 , @entity20 director of enforcement and financial crime , said : ' @entity0 held a senior position within the financial services industry			2
his actions fell short of the standards we expect			1
' approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and , where they do not , we will take action			0
' mr @entity0 was able to pay £ 42,550 for the dodged fares and £ 450 in legal costs within three days as part of an out - of - court settlement with rail firm @entity59			1
the @entity20 said mr @entity0 admitted in an interview to evading his train fare on a number of occasions and had done so in the knowledge he had been breaking the law			1
he had also admitted that he did not disclose his behaviour to his employer			0
mr @entity0 said in a statement : ' i have always recognised that what i did was foolish			0
i have apologised to all concerned and reiterate that apology publicly today			0
' the settlement i made with @entity59 in march 2014 was for an amount significantly in excess of the value of the fares not paid by me on the small number of occasions that i failed to pay			1
' indeed the size of the settlement could be said to have led to a distorted perception of the scale of my wrong - doing			2
however , that does not change the fact that what i did was wrong , and i accept that			0
' mr @entity0 insisted the money he paid back was ' significantly in excess ' of what he had dodged he added : ' in view of this , i have been told by the @entity92 that they do not regard it as being in the public interest to pursue a case against me			1
' while i respect the @entity20 's decision today , i also regret it , coming as it did after a 20 - year career in the @entity4 that was without blemish			1
mr @entity0 carried out the ruse by boarding the @entity19 - bound train from @entity16 , a rural station with no barriers in @entity17 , without buying a ticket , before ' tapping out ' using an oyster card at @entity18			2
it meant he paid a £ 7.20 maximum @entity106 fare rather than paying for a £ 21.50 train ticket for the one - hour 22 - minute journey			1
he was eventually caught in november last year by a ticket inspector standing next to the barrier			0
' i recognise that the @entity20 has on its plate more profound wrong - doing than mine in the financial services sector , and i am sorry that my case has taken up its time at this critical juncture for the future of the @entity4 and its reputation			1
' @entity0 admitted having failed to use his @entity106 card to tap in for five journeys between @entity120 – where he got off his train from @entity17 – and @entity18 , which should have cost him just £ 2.30 a time			2
however , further inquiries revealed that until 2008 @entity0 had been buying an annual season ticket from @entity16 , which has no ticket barriers , to @entity18 , which costs around £ 4,500 a year for standard class			0
a standard daily single fare is £ 21.50			0
@entity12 said in a statement : ' @entity0 left @entity12 earlier this year			0
what he admitted to the @entity20 is totally contrary to our values and principles			2
' a spokesman for @entity92 said : ' we conducted a full and thorough investigation following allegations that a rail traveller had repeatedly avoided paying the correct fare between @entity16 and central @entity19			0
' following these inquiries detectives have concluded that , at this stage , it would not be appropriate to take further action			0
' mr @entity141 often travelled from the rural station of @entity16 , @entity17 into @entity18 , @entity19			0
