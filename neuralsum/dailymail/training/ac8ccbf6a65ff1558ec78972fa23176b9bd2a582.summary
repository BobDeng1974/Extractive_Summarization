by @entity0 , @entity1 first it was a blood clot , then a broken jaw , but at last @entity4 can look forward to his first major international tournament with @entity6			1
the 28 - year - old centre - back has come a long way since the @entity9 , when his chances of making the squad were extinguished by a blood clot in his upper chest			1
at that time @entity4 was an outside bet , but when the @entity16 came around two years later he was a sure thing until sustaining a double fracture of the jaw in a warm - up match against @entity21			1
video : scroll down for @entity4 : @entity23 sweeter for me after @entity26 fracture blow ready : @entity4 is set to start in the heart of defence for @entity6 at the @entity23 in @entity29 battler : the defender collides with @entity32 forward @entity33 during their match in @entity36 on saturday now , though , the 28 - year - old centre - back is heading to the @entity23 , having come through saturday 's 0 - 0 ill - tempered draw with @entity32 unscathed , and it feels particularly special			1
' it does , because it is my first tournament , ' @entity4 said			1
' i have waited a long time to come and i was really excited previously			0
' @entity41 before i was an outside shot of making the club and i had my blood clot			0
' then i was one game away and i broke my jaw - it was like , ' is this not for me ? '			2
so for me to be involved in this is massive			0
' it 's been good of late			2
not that long ago i was n't really in the frame or i was grafting to get in the squad and just be a part of it , but now i feel like i 'm a big part of it , which is pleasing			0
' it shows how far i have come and i am obviously really happy			0
' @entity4 is not only part of the squad but an almost certain starter at centre - back alongside @entity63 in the @entity65 opener against @entity66 on june 14			1
overcoming the four - time @entity23 winners will be no mean feat for @entity70 's men , given @entity66 have the likes of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 at their disposal			1
partners in crime : @entity4 and @entity63 ( left ) have become @entity6 's regular centre back partnership starting line up ? @entity6 's 11 from their final warm - up game looks set to be their first choice team for @entity66 game furthermore , the @entity66 will have former @entity86 man @entity85 leading the attacking line			1
@entity85 is capable of everything from the sublime to the ridiculous , and @entity4 said : ' that 's dangerous is n't it because you never know - will he turn up , will he not ? ' he 's got potential to stick it into the top corner from 30 yards			1
he 's an unpredictable player but on his day obviously one of the best			2
' i played against him a couple of times at @entity86 and he 's been tough			0
i played against him another time when he came off after 60 , 70 minutes			0
at times he can be world class			0
but he 's certainly one to watch out for			0
' while at times erratic , @entity85 was one of the @entity101 's most exciting characters during his time at the @entity103			0
the league is set to lose another big character imminently , with @entity106 set to join @entity107 for a fee in the region of Â£ 40million			2
key men : the performances of @entity85 and @entity74 will be pivotal to @entity66 's @entity23 chances the @entity29 international found starts hard to come by at @entity114 under @entity115 last season , with his exit reflecting well on @entity4 and the way he has impressed alongside @entity119 in central defence			1
' he is a fantastic player , good luck to him , ' @entity4 added			2
' people do n't pay that sort of money for average players , they pay that money for the top players and he is in that category			0

@entity4 ready to make his bow on the major international stage
*ruled* out of the past two tournaments with *injury*
the 28 - year - old and @entity63 now @entity6 's first choice partnership
*defensive* pairing with @entity119 forced @entity106 away from @entity114
