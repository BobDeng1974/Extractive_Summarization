momentarily , he looked his age			2
having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin , @entity2 stood over his ball on the 18th green			1
he was n’t going to three - putt from there , so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36 - hole score in the history of the masters			1
he wanted it to be more than that , though			2
the best it could be			2
the exuberance of youth was kicking in			2
for the first time around @entity21 , he made a mild mis - step			2
he wheeled away , hopped a little , almost coltish in his frustration			0
he marched back to his ball , prepared to tap it in			0
except it was n’t a real tap - in			2
there was a bit still to do			0
and at that point , @entity2 checked			1
he did the sensible thing			0
@entity2 always does the sensible thing			1
that is part of his wonder			0
@entity2 walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14 - under 130 @entity2 leads @entity37 by five strokes , matching the largest halfway lead in @entity41 history some might think that makes him boring			1
it does n’t make him boring			0
to shoot 14 under , the lowest two - round score at @entity21 , and equal to the best 36 - hole score recorded at a major championship , is n’t boring			1
we may be watching a sporting phenomenon			0
a performance as breathtaking as @entity51 ’s arrival in 1997			1
there will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole			0
if @entity2 repeats his achievement at the @entity58 in @entity59 last year , perhaps , when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. those numbers are unlikely though			1
as the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery , his scores are bound to fall			2
against that , it will be a lot harder to chase @entity2 ’s total than just maintain it			1
modern courses have , of course , been @entity51 - proofed before — but in the short term @entity21 may need to be @entity2 - proofed , too , if his scoring stays stable			1
this was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. he has been in the top three players in five of those six , too			1
‘ i was a bit out of my comfort zone , at the moment on the 18th , ’ @entity2 confirmed			1
‘ i was going to have to work around @entity31 ’s line — and i just thought if i step away i am definitely going to make this putt , so that was the only way i could miss. ‘ i have to work to control those things the next two days			0
if i can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under , so i have to be ready for that and to match their scores now			2
the stress levels can get pretty high			0
still , it ’s pretty cool any time you can lead the masters and to set a record is awesome			1
’ @entity2 broke @entity101 's 36 - hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes at the age of 21 and playing in his second masters , @entity2 looks in complete control @entity107 , @entity2 ’s playing partner , had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day			1
@entity107 deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message ‘ @entity113 hole , @entity114 ’ as they stood on every tee			0
many had @entity21 pegged as the venue where @entity120 would complete his personal grand slam in 2015 ; instead , this masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young @entity126 gunslinger , now in the vanguard of an @entity129 revival			1
up ahead of @entity2 , @entity130 laboured valiantly to stay in touch			1
it was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career			0
at the age of 25 , as @entity120 is now , @entity130 won his first major , the 1994 @entity137			0
he was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade , and he won it again in 1997			0
by that time , however , a 21 - year - old called @entity51 had announced his arrival at the @entity141			1
the era of @entity130 never materialised			0
@entity120 may have achieved more and younger than @entity130 , and @entity2 may not be the ice - cold winning machine @entity51 was at his age — but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days			1
already in the record books , @entity2 has many more landmarks in sight these next two days			1
the record for birdies here stands at 25 from @entity153 ; @entity2 already has 15			1
his course management was outstanding			0
@entity2 took @entity21 on , yet remained entirely in control			1
it helps that he is exceptional , yet strangely unspectacular			0
as @entity157 pointed out recently there are better drivers , better chippers , better putters — and the statistics bear this out — but none who do all three as well as @entity2			1
he might not have the best game ; but he has the most complete			0
there were tiny aberrations — he found the pine straw twice on the back nine — but they were rare			0
most of the time , he was consistency personified , picking out the best line , the best lie , the most advantageous position on the green			0
when he dallied with a bunker on the par - five eighth , his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two - foot putt for birdie			2
@entity2 made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the @entity21 fairways and greens the young @entity126 pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round ‘ that was special , even for you , ’ said @entity107 ’s caddie @entity189			1
it was a masterful display , the work of a wise head not a callow college boy			0
it is n’t just that @entity2 does n’t think like a 21 - year - old			1
at the 15th , a par five and a good birdie opportunity , he sensibly laid up , and then made four			2
even when he missed , he missed cute			0
he has absorbed a lot from his mentor @entity200 , a fellow @entity126 and @entity21 expert			0
asked about ‘ @entity200 ’s advice ’ on thursday , @entity2 sweetly replied : ‘ do you mean mr @entity200 ? ’ there was n’t a hint of irony in his response			2
had he stayed in school , he would be studying for his finals right now			0
instead he is fast approaching £ 10m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major			0
the next @entity51 ? that is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders			1
the idea that @entity120 is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked			0
when @entity2 shot 63 to win the @entity218 at @entity219 , the conditions were windy and inhospitable			2
@entity120 said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made @entity2 ’s score			1
@entity224 claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in @entity228			0
where do @entity2 ’s first 36 holes stand in the annals at @entity21 ? @entity101 played the previous best 36 holes — 13 under par — in 1976			1
@entity2 now has that record , as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18 - hole lead			1
like @entity120 ’s @entity137 victory at @entity240 in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books			2
he has barely put a foot wrong			0
nice hole , @entity114 ? seriously , dude , name one that was n’t			0
@entity2 recovers from among the trees at 13 , and his caddie @entity249 has to hand it to him ( below )			2

@entity2 set a new masters scoring record with a 14 - under 130 through two rounds at @entity255
this was @entity2 's sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par
the next @entity51 ? that is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders
