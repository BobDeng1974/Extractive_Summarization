verdict : former police chief @entity16 facing the court during his trial in @entity11 , in southwest @entity3 's @entity25 province on the bribery charge , prosecutors said @entity16 had improperly accepted 3.05 million renminbi , which equates to £ 300,000 ( $ 484,127			2
) the most explosive charges against wang - defection and abuse of power - were heard in a closed - door hearing			0
they were connected to his unexpected visit to the @entity7 consulate in @entity11 in february , during which he handed over sensitive information about @entity5 ’s grisly death to @entity7 consulate officials			1
his dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of powerful politician @entity43 and the conviction of @entity43 ’s wife , @entity45 , who was last month handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41 - year - old @entity5 over a business dispute			1
trial : @entity3 police chief @entity16 ( left ) , who exposed the murder of @entity6 businessman @entity5 ( right ) and then tried to defect to the @entity7 @entity16 later turned himself in and provided information to investigators that led to a murder conviction against @entity5 's business associate @entity45 , the wife of @entity55 chief @entity43			1
she received a suspended death sentence			1
the trial summary briefly described @entity16 's role in covering up the murder last year , saying that he ' knew perfectly well ' that @entity45 was under ' serious suspicion ' for the crime all along			2
on guard : @entity3 policemen stand guard outside the @entity66 's intermediate court in @entity11 , in southwest @entity3 's @entity25 province it said that although he helped cover it up , both the prosecutors and defense lawyers told the court that he later cooperated with authorities			0

the pair ruled with an iron fist over the western @entity3 mega city of @entity83 and enjoyed national fame together			0
but their relationship imploded late last year after the death of @entity5 and the erratic behaviour of @entity43 ’s wife @entity45 , who with the help of her orderly killed the @entity93 with a cyanide - laced drink following a business dispute			1
prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with @entity16 before murdering @entity5 and reported back to him afterwards			0
@entity16 then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the @entity7 after falling out with @entity43 earlier this year			0
@entity16 's dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of politician @entity43 and the conviction of @entity43 's wife , @entity45 , who was handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41 - year - old @entity5 but he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to @entity3 armed police who had surrounded the consulate			1

@entity16 's trial clears the way for the leadership to deal with the scandal 's stickiest issue : whether to expel @entity43 from the party and prosecute him			1
