by @entity0 many animals can communicate effectively with one another but humans are unique in our ability to acquire language			0
scientists have long questioned how we are able to do this and now a new study suggests that the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an innate biological instinct – much like birdsong			1
the @entity16 research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language , which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans			0
born to talk : new research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language , which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans while languages differ from each other in many ways , certain aspects appear to be shared across them and these aspects might stem from linguistic principles that are active in all human brains , according to the study			1
‘ the results suggest that , the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an inborn biological instinct , very much like birdsong , ’ said professor @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity36 , who co-authored the study with a research team from the @entity39 in @entity40			1
newborns reacted differently to the ' good ' and ' bad ' types of words in a similar way to adults , the study found many languages have similar sound - combinations that occur at the beginning of words , such as ‘ bl ’ , while few languages have words that start with ‘ lb ’			1
linguists have suggested that such patterns occur because human brains are biased to favour syllables such as ‘ bla ’ over ‘ lba ’ and past research has shown that adult speakers display such preferences , even if their native language has no words resembling either bla or lba			1
to understand where this knowledge comes from and whether it is a universal linguistic principle or the sum of experience , the team looked carefully at how young babies perceive different types of words			2
they used a silent and non-invasive technique called near - infrared spectroscopy to examine how the oxygenation of the brain cortex – the very first centimetres of grey matter just below the scalp – changes in time , to look at the brain reactions of newborn babies who listened to ‘ good ’ and ‘ bad ’ sounds such as ‘ blif ’ and ‘ lbif ’			1
the scientists saw that the newborns reacted differently to the two types of words in a similar way to adults			1
young infants have not learned any words yet and do not even babble , yet they still share a sense of how words should sound with adults			2
the researchers believe that this finding shows that we are born with the basic , foundational knowledge about the sound pattern of human languages			2
the study was published in the journal @entity111			0
people who can switch between two languages seamlessly have a higher level of mental flexibility than monolinguals , a recent study suggests			2
researchers believe bilingualism strengthens the brain 's executive functions , such as its working memory and ability to multitask and problem solve			0
the psychologists think that as fluent bilinguals seem to use both languages at all times but rarely use words unintentionally , they have control of both languages simultaneously			0
@entity132 , professor of psychology , linguistics and women 's studies at @entity135 , said : ' not only is bilingualism not bad for you , it may be really good			0
' when you 're switching languages all the time it strengthens your mental muscle and your executive function becomes enhanced			0
' the study , published in @entity143 , found fluent bilinguals have both languages ' active ' at the same time , whether they are consciously using them or not			1
pointing to bilingual people 's ability to rarely say a word in the unintended language , the researchers believe they have the ability to control both languages to select the one they want to use without consciously thinking about it .			0

certain aspects appear to be shared across languages and might stem from linguistic principles that are active in all human brains , study claims
