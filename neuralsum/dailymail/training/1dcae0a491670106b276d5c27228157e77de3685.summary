a teenager says his life was saved by memories of the late @entity3 @entity3 after his leg was pierced by a stingray barb as he swam in shallow waters			1
@entity7 , 17 , spent more than 24 hours in agony after the marine animal 's razor sharp barb sank more than 6cm into his right leg , narrowly missing his bone , as he swam off a beach in @entity15 's @entity14			1
he resisted the urge to pull the spike out in a desperate attempt to ease the pain because he knew that could cause serious bleeding and severe tissue damage			0
@entity3 died in 2006 when he was struck in the heart by a barb as he filmed a marine documentary			2
‘ @entity3 did pop into my head when it happened			0
i remembered that they thought @entity3 had pulled the stingray barb out , ' mr @entity7 told @entity31			1
the stingray left it 's barb deeply lodged in @entity7 's leg			1
the 17 - year - old had to wait more than 24 painful hours until the barb was removed in a two hour operation			1
after the attack , mr @entity7 thought of the late @entity3 , and knew not to remove the barb from his leg in fear of making his injury worse			1
it is widely speculated that @entity3 's fatal attack from a stingray was made worse when he allegedly pulled the barb out from his chest			2
‘ so i knew not to pull it out or the bleeding would be even worse , so i knew to let someone qualified medically take it out properly			0
' to add to his agony , mr @entity7 had to wait more than 24 hours for the barb to be removed when @entity53 suffered a power outage			1
the incident happened on thursday morning while he swam at @entity56 in the @entity14 , whilst doing his bronze medallion test for his school ’s sport and recreation class			0
‘ i was swimming in waist - deep water			0
i was standing on the bottom and it was so murky you could n’t see the bottom , ’ he said			0
‘ i felt a sharp pain that i thought must have been a broken branch in my leg			0
but it was really the serrated edges of the barb			0
‘ i freaked out a little bit , but all the students down in the water with me helped me get to the beach			0
’ a lifesaver identified that it was a stingray barb and mr @entity7 ’s ‘ upset and stressed out ’ mother , @entity80 , rushed to her son 's side			1
the 17 - year - old @entity82 student was dragged to shore by his classmates however , the trouble was far from over once @entity7 got to hospital , as @entity53 was in the grips of a major power outage			1
the schoolboy ’s operation was delayed by more than 24 hours , as he was constantly bumped down the list , waiting to transferred to the private hospital			2
x-rays eventually showed that the barb was 6cm above @entity7 's right knee – only narrowly missing the bone			2
‘ it was annoying and frustrating to wait for so long , but i do understand that my life was n’t in danger like some of the other people that were coming into emergency , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
an x-ray shows that the stingray 's barb plunged more than six centimetres into @entity7 's leg , ' only just ' missing the bone a stingray ’s venom is painful , but rarely fatal			1
the sting is near the base of the tale , containing a spine with serrated edges			0
the stingray pierces the victim , at which point venom flows into the wound			0
however , the victim is also at risk of tissue necrosis , infection and other serious ailments			0
mr @entity7 was in surgery for almost two hours and is expected to be released from hospital on monday			2
he has ‘ lots ’ of stitches but has n’t seen the wound yet , because he ’s ‘ all bandaged up			0
’ his family says it is ‘ typical ’ that the photos of @entity7 on the beach after the incident all show the 17 - year - old on his phone			1
his family says it is ‘ typical ’ that the photos of @entity7 on the beach after the incident all show the 17 - year - old on his phone			1
a blackout at @entity53 meant @entity7 had to wait more than 24 hours to be moved to the private hospital , as his name kept getting bumped down the waiting list			1
he was being given morphine to deal with the excruciating pain @entity3 died in 2006 and his chest was speared by a @entity149 barb			0

a @entity152 teenager spent more than 24 hours with stingray barb in his leg
@entity7 was ' *stabbed* ' while swimming at @entity152 's @entity56
he thought of @entity3 and knew to leave the barb in his leg
had to wait at hospital for more than a day *due* to major power outage
17 - year - old 's family joke that it is ' typical ' that he is on his phone during pics of the *accident* but @entity7 *insists* he was not taking *selfies* !
