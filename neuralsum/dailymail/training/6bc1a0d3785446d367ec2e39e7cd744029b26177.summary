by @entity0 published : 11:55 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 11:55 est , 22 august 2012 an @entity2 archaeologist who discovered that his relatives were killed at @entity4 has used his skills to shed new light on the dark history of the notorious @entity9 death camp			1
after learning that two of his uncles were murdered at @entity13 launched a landmark excavation project at the site of the camp in east @entity17 , where some 250,000 @entity18 are believed to have been murdered by the @entity19 during @entity20 unlike other locations that were given at least a facade of being prison or labour camps , @entity4 - along with neighbouring camps @entity26 and @entity27 - was designed specifically for the mass extermination of @entity18 , with victims transported to the site in cattle cars and gassed almost immediately			1
@entity4 was bulldozed to the ground by the @entity19 in 1943 in an attempt to cover their tracks , but mr @entity35 has managed to pinpoint the location of the gas chambers where hundreds of thousands of people were sent to their death over an 18 month period			1
future scholarship : @entity2 students listen as @entity35 discusses the findings of his excavations , which have provided a new insight into the workings of @entity4 the @entity19 leveled the camp and replanted over it following an uprising at the site in 1943			1
this , combined with the fact that there were so few survivors of @entity4 - only 64 were known - has made researching @entity4 famously difficult			2
new evidence : the archaeologist believes the death toll at the camp in east @entity17 may be even higher than previously thought researchers were able to gain a limited understanding of how @entity4 operated from partial @entity62 documentation and the memories of the few survivors that did live to tell their tale - but there has never been an authentic layout of the death camp			1
' i feel like i am an investigator in a criminal forensic laboratory , ' said mr @entity35 , 51			2
' after all , it is a murder scene			0
' over five years of excavations , @entity35 has been able to remap the camp and has unearthed thousands of items ; including jewellery , keys and coins that have helped him to identify some of @entity4 's formerly nameless victims			2
the heavy concentration of ashes uncovered at the site has led the archaeologist to believe that far more than 250,000 @entity18 were actually killed at the death camp			2
' because of the lack of information about @entity4 , every little piece of information is significant , ' mr @entity35 told @entity89 from his home in @entity2			1
' no one knew where the gas chambers were			0
the @entity62 did n't want anyone to find out what was there , but thanks to what we have done , they did n't succeed			0
' the archaeologist said the most touching artefact uncovered by his investigations was an engraved metal identification tag belonging to a six - year - old @entity18 girl murdered at the camp			2
mr @entity35 called @entity106 - whose death at the camp was confirmed by @entity2 's @entity109 - the ' symbol of @entity4 '			1
' the @entity62 did n't discriminate			0
they killed little girls too , ' he said			0
' this thing [ the tag ] has been waiting for 70 years for somebody to find it			0
' ' @entity116 ' : this engraved identity tag retrieved from the site belonged to a six - year - old @entity18 girl murdered at the camp @entity35 's digs , backed by @entity109 , could serve as a template for future scholarship into the @entity124 , in which the @entity19 and their collaborators killed about 6 million @entity18			1
' i think the use of archaeology offers the possibility of giving us information that we did n't have before , ' @entity126 , a prominent @entity124 historian from @entity127 , said			0
' it gives us another perspective when we are at the stage when we have very few people who can speak in the first person singular			0
' on the subject of whether the archaeological evidence points to higher death toll at @entity4 than previously thought , she said : ' it is not out of sync with other research that has been done '			1
mr @entity35 's basic method is similar to what he does at home in @entity2 , where he does digs for the country 's antiquities authority in the south - cutting out squares of land and sifting the earth through a filter			1
because of the difficult conditions at @entity4 and the sensitive nature of the effort , he is also relying on more non-invasive , high - tech aids such as ground - penetrating radar and global positioning satellite imaging			0
family history : archaeologist @entity35 talks to students from @entity2 's @entity164 about his work at the site of the infamous @entity4 death camp traces of the past : mr @entity35 and his team have uncovered thousands of personal items belonging to @entity4 victims over five years of excavations based on debris collected and patterns in the soil , he has been able to figure out where the @entity19 placed poles to hold up the camp 's barbed wire fences			1
that led him to his major breakthrough â€” the mapping of what the @entity62 called the @entity187 , or the ' @entity188 ' , a path upon which the inmates were marched naked into the gas chambers			0
he determined its route by the poles that marked the path and from that , he determined where the gas chambers would have been located			0
he also discovered that another encampment was not located where originally thought and uncovered an internal train route within @entity4			0
he dug up mounds of bullets at killing sites , utensils from where he believes the camp kitchen was located and a swastika insignia of a @entity9 officer			0
during the course of the excavations he and his @entity17 partner @entity208 , helped by some 20 labourers , have retrieved thousands of personal items belonging to @entity4 victims ; from eye glasses , perfume bottles and dentures , to a child 's @entity217 pin and engraved @entity212 also uncovered a unique version of the yellow star @entity18 were forced to wear by the @entity19 , made out of metal instead of cloth , which researchers determined to have originated in @entity224			2
mass killing : a suggested map of how the camp may have looked - there has never been an authentic layout of @entity4 , although mr @entity35 's research has uncovered new details			1

@entity35 's excavations have shed new light on the workings of the notorious camp , which was levelled by the @entity19 in a bid to cover their tracks
mr @entity35 's research has led him to believe the death toll at the camp was even higher than the previous estimate of 250,000
the @entity2 archaeologist was *inspired* to investigate the site after learning that two of his relations perished at @entity4
