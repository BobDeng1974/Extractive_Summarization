by @entity0 for @entity1 it is @entity4 's tallest war memorial and an iconic fixture of @entity6 since 1925 , but the arrival of a new hotel has silenced the @entity11 market town 's iconic memorial			1
the town council has been forced to compromise with a new @entity13 which called for the chimes of the memorial to be restricted in order to stop guests being disturbed			1
instead of sounding off every 15 minutes from 6.15am the bell will first toll at 8.15am each day to enable the @entity13 to live up to its promise of a great night 's sleep for guests			1
@entity22 silenced : a @entity13 's opening in @entity6 reduced the @entity25 's bell song by two hours the bell historically chimes until 10pm , and will continue to do so despite attempts from the @entity13 to shut it down at 8pm , a request rejected by the council of the historic town , which lies 10 miles north - east of @entity31			1
@entity6 deputy mayor @entity32 , who is chairman of the @entity34 group and whose husband is a bell ringer , said the compromise is a good move for the town as it bids to attract tourism			2
' most people wo n't notice the difference because there are n't that many people around at that time of the morning , ' @entity41 told the @entity46			0
@entity13 has spent £ 6.5million on the hotel on @entity48 and brought 30 jobs to the town			1
the 63 - bed accommodation is built around the former @entity53 pub. the 90 - foot tall memorial was commissioned by manufacturer sir @entity55 and his wife @entity57 in tribute to their son , lieutenant @entity59 , who was killed in action at @entity62 in 1915			0
historic : sir @entity55 ( left ) and his wife @entity57 commissioned the memorial for their son , lieutenant @entity59 , who died a war hero in @entity68 , and the tower being opened in 1925 the monument , which has four clock faces , honours all victims of @entity74 and has plaques commemorating the 535 men and women from @entity6 and the surrounding district who died in those conflicts			1
the building was restored between 2010 and 2012 thanks mostly to a grant from the @entity84			0
the clock 's keeper , @entity86 , perhaps the man most likely to be put out by the two - hour silencing also considers the good of the town when commenting on the @entity13 's influence			1
keeping the peace : locals have responded favourably to the arrival of the @entity13 in @entity6 he pointed out to the @entity95 that the clock once chimed every 15 minutes for 24 hours			1
' this was before electronic timers and it would have been impracticable to fit a silencer , ' he told the paper			0
' i do n’t think it makes much of a difference			0
if you book a hotel room in a nice quiet town i think it ’s fair enough to expect a quiet night ’s sleep			2
' the agreement with the @entity13 also means the bell can be rung three additional times each year ' to mark significant occasions			2
' a spojepserson fro @entity13 said : ' in close consultation with the local council we agreed with them that the bells would not ring between 10pm and 8am to help guests to get a great night 's sleep			2
' however , the bells will continue to ring at all other times			0
the agreement also means that the bells can be rung an additional three times a year , inclusive of the 10pm - 8am period , to mark significant occasions			0
' so far the feedback we have received from residents and local businesses has been extremely positive but we will continue to monitor this on an on - going basis			0
we hope that the new jobs created by the hotel and the investment in the area underlines our commitment to the town			0

the @entity25 , opened in 1925 , will chime for two hours less
the clock now chimes every 15 minutes from 8.15am instead of 6.15am
@entity13 has invested £ 6.5million into their new @entity11 hotel
chain also asked for bell to stop at 8pm instead of 10pm , but was rejected
