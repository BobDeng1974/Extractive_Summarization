@entity0 is expected to launch a new green product in @entity2 , made from a naturally sweet plant , in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers			1
the new carbonated beverage provides a lower - calorie soft drink than @entity0 's traditional red can and has more natural ingredients than @entity11			1
but unlike @entity11 , which is completely sugar free , @entity12 still has sugar			1
the new addition to @entity0 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for @entity18 , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic @entity0			1
however , it has 60 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant @entity38 and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar			1
nutritionist @entity42 from @entity44 said that @entity38 is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink @entity12			1
' @entity44 would still say that while it 's safe it 's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets			0
' the problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion			1
@entity12 ( left ) comes in a green can and has 60 per cent less sugar than regular @entity0 ( right ) @entity12 uses a mix of sugar and natural plant @entity38 , which has been in @entity60 as a sweetener for over 30 years @entity62 is a man - made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages			1
the safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies			0
however , the @entity71 concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure			0
people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it			0
' the other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks , whether sweetened naturally or artificially , are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight , ' she told @entity89			0
' it is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it			0
no matter what , the best drink is water and that ’s we ’d still agree			0
' if you ’re wondering what the need for another low - calorie @entity0 drink is , the global brand which is worth an estimated $ 74 billion @entity99 dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about about artificial sweeteners like @entity62 , one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives			1
@entity62 is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well - known brands of food , drink and medicine			2
however , it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health			0
@entity18 ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women			1
unlike @entity11 ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , @entity12 still has sugar one study linked diet drinks containing @entity62 to premature births , while another suggested it could cause cancer			1
however , in december 2013 , the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe , so @entity0 have continued to use it			2
@entity38 is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener ( steviol glycoside ) is obtained			1
you can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream , water - based beverages , brewed soft drinks , plain and flavoured soy beverages			2
it can be used in cooking and baking according to the @entity155 website , excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar			0
it has been used in @entity60 as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both @entity161 and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the @entity71 and @entity164			0
@entity161 has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns			0
@entity12 does not contain @entity62 so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than @entity11			1
' i guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful			0
but because research has n’t been done checking @entity38 it seems to be quiet safe in those respects , ’ ms @entity178 said			2
@entity12 is meant to taste similar to classic @entity0 but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage			1
the drink is already available in the @entity188 , @entity99 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
rival soft drink brand pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses @entity38 as a sweetener in some markets			2
they have named it @entity199			0
meanwhile , the @entity200 has reported @entity201 will soon announce major job cuts to combat a drop in revenues in the @entity2 beverages business			2
chief executive @entity206 is expected to unveil a new profit - sharing structure with the @entity208 in @entity209 .			2

@entity12 comes in a green can and has 27 calories
it has 60 per cent less calories than classic coke
unlike @entity11 and @entity18 it still contains sugar
but it uses the plant @entity38 to sweeten it as well , instead of the man - made sweetener aspartame used in @entity11
nutrition @entity2 says the drink still encourages people to want sweet things and is still likely to cause dental erosion
@entity0 are expected to launch the product in @entity2
