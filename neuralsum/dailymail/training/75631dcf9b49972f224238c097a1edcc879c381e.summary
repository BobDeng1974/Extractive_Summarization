@entity0 ? @entity1 ? no – this huge crowd of surfers is gathering in the waters off @entity5			1
this was the scene yesterday at @entity8 , a spot proving more popular than ever with day - trippers and holidaymakers on the first weekend of august			1
photographer @entity11 , who took these pictures at midday yesterday , said : ‘ the beach was busier than i ’ve seen it in years			0
‘ this makes surfing or swimming a much more attractive option , wetsuit or no wetsuit			0
’ @entity8 is a popular location for experienced surfers and beginners alike , with a strong lifeguard presence and plenty of surfing schools and instructors taking advantage of the sport ’s ever increasing popularity			1
yesterday it was reported that more and more of us are choosing to take our holidays in @entity24 rather than go abroad			0
nearly three - quarters of us are taking a ‘ staycation ’ this year , up from 33 per cent in 2010 , and 65 per cent last year , according to a survey by @entity58			1
travel industry analyst @entity60 said last week that summer bookings for overseas holidays were down 7 per cent in june , the third monthly fall in a row			2
having a splashing time : @entity66 , @entity66 , was drenched as she waited to present medals to the hockey teams but roared with laughter good spirits : her sleek hair and pristine dress were soaked but @entity66 joked and laughed with organisers , clearly enjoying the @entity74 celebrations : the weather may have been bleak but @entity66 and her group lit up spirits by roaring with applause as @entity80 took to the podium to take gold the holiday rentals service @entity83 , which has about 20,000 @entity24 properties on its books , said inquiries for stays in @entity24 had risen by 32 per cent compared with last year , with the @entity89 the most popular area			1
for those who have chosen to stay in the @entity24 , fortunes look fairly mixed			0
yesterday there were warnings that after a sunday which was sunny in many parts , showers will hit over the next seven days			2
tomorrow will be more unsettled , with more showers in the @entity99 and @entity89 , while wednesday will bring scattered heavy showers in the @entity5 and @entity89			1
thursday will be rainy and cloudy across most areas			0
meanwhile @entity66 , @entity66 seemed more than happy to brave the rain in @entity103 for the @entity74 closing ceremony			0
royal approval : @entity106 ( right ) with @entity108 sailors during @entity109 in the @entity110 smiling : miss @entity106 ( right ) was in the @entity110 for @entity111 , one of the longest - running regattas in the world she arrived in a sleek red dress yesterday , with her hair pristine , to present medals to @entity80 's winning hockey team			1
within seconds her locks were drenched and wedges squelching in the grass - but the @entity66 roared with laughter , beaming and applauding all the way through			2
the world 's top athletes have so far been pleasantly surprised by @entity103 's weather at the @entity74			1
even @entity127 remarked on the tournament 's pleasant weather - although the rest was ' a bit sh * * '			1
and visitors to a farm in @entity32 , @entity33 , were treated to a spectacular sea of golden yellow as sunflowers , that have come into bloom , glistened in the sun. having only been around in @entity24 since the 1980s , when they were grown on a very small scale , the scene looked more like one from @entity143 in the south of @entity145			0
@entity146 opened : meanwhile in @entity103 the peloton made its way through the pouring rain as the @entity74 comes to an end nearing the closing ceremony humid : temperatures remain relatively high for @entity103 , in the high teens , but cyclists squinted as they pedalled through the worst of the rain forecast for tonight cheery : spectators were undeterred by the dismal weather which marred the finale , lining the streets in raincoats and clutching umbrellas to cheer the cyclists on but now , as the country experiences warmer weather , more @entity24 farmers are planting the golden yellow blooms , which are used for bird seed and sunflower oil			2
the flowers have bloomed just before the tail - end of the lavender season , meaning much of @entity33 's countryside is a kaleidoscope of colour			1
the fields have a few more days to flourish in the sunshine before showers hit and a rain system sweeps in from the south west			2
' we were expecting the sunflowers to open in another week , but lots of them have suddenly opened up overnight , ' said @entity185 , who helps run family business @entity186 at @entity188 in @entity32			0
' traditionally @entity189 does n't have the growing conditions for sunflowers and they are better suited to warmer climates with lots of sunshine and downpours of rain			0
i do like to be beside the seaside : @entity199 glistened in the summer sun which coated the shore on the first weekend of august relaxing : spectators at the @entity203 in @entity204 , @entity205 , reclined on the grassy hills , catching the sun before showers hit summer time : it is typical august weather for the home counties , meaning a mix of high temperatures and sprinkling showers ' the sunflowers have n't looked very good for the last two years because last year it was cold and a late start to the summer and in 2012 it was very wet			1
' this year the weather has been perfect for them with lots of sun , followed by some heavy downpours , and we 've got a great crop			1
‘ the lavender is still flowering and the fields look amazing next to each other			0
' we think there may be at least two weeks now when the plants are in bloom together			0
‘ it 's a very unusual sight in @entity33 and one which more people would associate with @entity143 so we 've been getting lots of comments			2
' sunflowers are one of the latest booming crops to hit the @entity24 with a bumper harvest expected this year from the 800 acres across the country			2
idyllic : as sun burst through the few drifting clouds in @entity204 ( left ) , a couple of friends in @entity5 ( right ) spotted a heart - shaped cloud action : jockeys splashed through the sun - soaked obstacles as light winds blew through the park in @entity205 while spectators had picnics ' we mainly grow lavender but decided to add sunflowers to extend the season , ' added @entity185 , who has 15 acres of lavender and two acres with around 10,000 towering 5ft tall sunflowers			1
' people can pick the sunflowers and take photos in the fields			0
we hope they will stay in bloom for at least three weeks as they are a really magnificent sight			0
' elsewhere , in @entity5 , two holidaymakers were treated to the sight of a fluffy cloud floating above them - shaped like a giant heart			1
@entity275 , 29 and her friend @entity276 , 36 , were relaxing by a swimming pool when they saw it drifting overhead			0
@entity280 , an executive assistant , grabbed her phone and took a photo of the amazing formation as the perfect reminder of her trip to @entity286 , @entity5			1
she said : ' we were both lying out in the garden and we happened to look up at the sky and there right in front of the sun was a perfect heart - shaped cloud			2
we could hardly believe our eyes			0
' it felt like a confirmation from the universe that despite all the hating going on in the world right now there is a lot of love all around us and human beings need to realise that			0
