by @entity0 published : 12:43 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 13:03 est , 24 august 2012 @entity1 thought she had the perfect marriage			1
with a handsome husband and two young daughters , her life was complete			2
but just two years ago , her life was turned upside down when her husband @entity6 discovered that he was gay			1
at first @entity1 , 30 , felt as though her life had crumbled around her			1
but instead of being angry , @entity1 found the inner strength to forgive her former husband - and even helped him to find a boyfriend			1
@entity6 , 27 , and @entity1 , 30 , were happily married until @entity6 realised he was gay now , @entity6 and @entity10 are happily married - while @entity1 is regarded as a close family friend			1
the three , who appeared on the @entity14 sofa to discuss their unusual relationship , say that they are now one big happy family			0
@entity1 , who many would have forgiven for presuming her five year marriage to @entity6 had been a sham , says she never had an inkling her husband was gay			1
' i never had a clue , ' she says now			0
' there was never a time when i thought he was effeminate , or gay			2
' i never thought for a minute he was curbing his instinct			0
' even more surprising is the fact that @entity6 says that he did n't know either			1
so was it just a road to @entity33 transformation ? ' yes , ' says @entity6			1
' i never had an inkling			0
' @entity35 ever wanted was kids and a wife			0
i ’ve always said that if i ’d known , i would n’t have married and had my children			1
' but i do n’t regret that for a minute			0
back then , i loved it – we were very happy together			0
' the two met when @entity6 was 19 and @entity1 was 23 through their siblings			1
it was love at first sight and the pair married quickly			2
now @entity1 , @entity6 and his new husband @entity10 , 29 , regard their unusual situation as just ' one big happy family ' ' there were three dates that we could get married on - and one of them was a month away , @entity6 recalls			1
' we went for that one - we only had a month to plan our wedding			2
' the two were blissfully happy , until one night when the two decided to watch an adult film together			0
the pornographic scenes of a heterosexual couple gave way to some scenes involving two men engaged in a sex act together			0
' as i came across it , i did n't turn it off , ' @entity6 says			1
' at first , it was just that it did n't annoy or repulse me			0
i was shocked to find i liked it , ' he says			2
further on , as i kept going , i realised i really did like it			0
' at that point , @entity6 decided he must be bisexual			2
realising her husband had made a major discovery , @entity1 urged her @entity6 to explore that area of his life			1
' we spoke about his feelings , ' @entity1 says			1
' it was n't something that happened overnight			0
i said to @entity6 , " you have to experience that part of your life			2
i do n't want you to live a lie with me and the children			0
' then , @entity6 was still under the impression he was bisexual - but decided to do as @entity1 suggested and look for a boyfriend			1
' you ca n't control when that ' something ' comes out , ' @entity6 says			2
' i was as shocked as @entity1			2
@entity10 , right , came out to his family when he was 13 , and says he is n't at all fazed by the unusual set - up he has with @entity6 and @entity1 ' you do n't just wake up one day and go , " i 'm gay ! "			1
' we talked in depth about it , ' says @entity1			2
' it ’s not something we light - heartedly skimmed over			0
’ remarkably , @entity1 says she holds no anger towards the man who left her for another man			2
' @entity106 ? ‘ i have gay relationships in my family already , ' she says			0
' my brother is gay as well			0
we are used to dealing with gays in the family , it ’s accepted			0
' @entity1 and @entity6 admit that telling the children was the hardest part			1
' we spoke about it , then it came to , " how do we tell the kids ? ’ ' i ’ve lost you as a husband but i want to keep you as a friend ' ' we both dealt with it a mature way , ' @entity6 says - adding that @entity1 showed what a good friend she could be			1
for @entity1 's part , she says she does not grieve for the husband she lost			1
' i 'd rather have him as a good friend , ' she says			0
' we need to keep relationship natural and good for children			0
' ' we used to send each other cards – i ’ve lost you as a husband but i want to keep you as a friend , ’ @entity6 adds			1
soon after the couple split , @entity6 met @entity10 and the two were married within the year			1
@entity6 says he knew @entity10 was the one as soon as they met - but that telling @entity1 was difficult			1
‘ i knew he was the one , but to tell my ex-wife was the final bit			0
to tell her , i 've moved on , i 've met someone who is @entity136 - that was hard , ' he says			0
for his part , @entity10 , who came out to his family when he was 13 , is open - minded about the unusual situation			1
he says he was brought up with a big family , so the fact that @entity6 had children - and a wife - did n't perturb him at all			1
so is @entity10 at all worried that @entity6 could return to heterosexual past ? ' at the beginning , we were all so close			1
in the back of my mind i thought he could go back with @entity1 again			2
but once we had our civil partnership i knew			0
' but we are all still very close			0
' @entity6 says that by appearing on this morning , he hopes to help other men who might be in the same situation			2
' it 's not about not being true to yourself , ' he says			0
' some people are ashamed , and i want them to see how well we work as a family unit			0
hopefully people can see how accepting we are			0
