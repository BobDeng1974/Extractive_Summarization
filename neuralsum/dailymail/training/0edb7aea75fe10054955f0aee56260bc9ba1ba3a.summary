by @entity0 nursing both a badly broken arm and a fractured leg , you would think i could reasonably expect a little sympathy — especially in a doctor ’s surgery			1
what i got was the opposite			2
arriving at my gp practice for a check - up , i found that the cast on my arm plus the orthopaedic boot i was wearing made it difficult to use the touch - screen system to announce my arrival — so i queued to ask the receptionist if she would check me in at her computer instead			1
but rather than taking a few seconds to help me out , with a look of triumph in her eyes she sneered : ‘ why do n’t you use your other hand ? ’ and sent me hobbling back to the screen			2
left shaken : @entity0 was shocked by the callous treatment she received from her gp 's receptionist i was fairly shaken , but did n’t argue because so many gp ’s receptionists appear to have diplomas in sour - faced indifference			1
the callous , supercilious , rude and apathetic attitude of many of them must surely top most people ’s list of complaints against the @entity38			1
when we are sick , vulnerable and anxious , the surgery is our first point of contact			2
yet all too often the waiting - room staff are less guardian angels than dragons at the gate			1
i ’ve heard complaint after complaint about the bad attitudes encountered by my friends and family			1
many have spoken of their frustration at being fobbed off and even lied to			2
many , like me , felt dehumanised and humiliated			1
none are surprised to read stories of people treated appallingly by their gp ’s admin staff , such as the woman last month who was forced to wait outside by a busy road after a doctor ’s receptionist said her sick 16 - month - old baby was crying too loudly			1
rarely , if ever , are these people challenged , as they hold us over a barrel			2
while i accept there are plenty of good , hard - working doctors ’ receptionists out there who strive to help patients , i also know there are many who can be real battleaxes			1
an offended receptionist equals no appointment			1
but after my own upsetting experience , i told my doctor what had happened			2
he seemed at a loss to explain and apologised			2
i later wrote a strong letter to the practice manager , who told me that not all staff had received their full training yet , as if that were any excuse			1
but as we all know , this kind of attitude tends to be the rule — and for the elderly , in particular , it can be a nightmare			0
it often starts with a phone call you ’ve been poised to make since dawn , as having your finger on the redial button the moment surgery phone lines open is your only chance of getting through			0
each month , 23 million people ( more than three times the population of @entity101 ) visit their gp surgery or practice nurse my friend @entity104 , a 92 - year - old widow from @entity105 who suffers from several painful illnesses that need continual monitoring , recently had a shocking experience			0
‘ i was ringing to get some blood test results , ’ she told me			0
‘ it was difficult getting through , but eventually i spoke to a receptionist and told her i ’d been asked to make an appointment to see or speak to the doctor about them			1
‘ she told me to hang on a moment while she spoke to the doctor			0
a good 15 minutes passed before i had to hang up			0
‘ an hour later i rang again , and when i got the same woman i asked her why she ’d left me hanging on the phone			1
she replied rudely : “ because i had nothing to tell you			0
” ’ eventually , @entity104 rang again and was put through to another receptionist who also put her on hold			1
@entity123 : like @entity125 many waiting room staff leave patients feeling humiliated and dehumanised ‘ she promised me faithfully she ’d call back , ’ says @entity104			1
‘ but again i waited and waited			0
it ’s been days now and i have n’t heard a thing			0
’ to me , this illustrates perfectly all that is going wrong at reception — especially with the elderly , who get anxious about problems but are brushed off like irritating flies			0
no wonder they are so disheartened and either give up — putting their health at risk — or go to @entity142			0
and every busy working mother will identify with the frustration of @entity146 woman @entity145			0
‘ i ’d managed to get an appointment about getting some acne lotion for my 14 - year - old daughter , ’ says @entity145 , who is in her 40s			1
‘ i saw the doctor , got the prescription and went next door to the pharmacy , where i was told that the lotion was n’t available any more			0
‘ i rushed back into the surgery — i was already late for work and had to fit in another appointment — but by then there was a long queue			1
‘ i explained what had happened to the receptionist and asked if there was any chance she could ask the doctor if she could write me another prescription			1
‘ she just said : “ no , i ca n’t			0
you ’ll have to ring in the morning to see the doctor again			0
” i pointed out that the next day was saturday , when they took only emergencies , but i might as well have been talking to a brick wall			0
’ it ’s no surprise that figures released in 2012 showed that complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 a week , with a rise in grievances about surly receptionists			1
complaints : many others share @entity184 's frustrations so what has gone wrong ? ‘ the @entity38 sometimes forgets that it ’s a service provider and should put the patient first , ’ says one senior nurse			2
‘ there are too many people trying to get into too few surgeries , and doctors condone their receptionists ’ behaviour because it keeps the patients at bay			1
‘ it reflects the state of everything else in the @entity38 — but that does n’t excuse their terrible manner			0
’ @entity202 , a business trainer who runs workshops for @entity205 receptionists to help them improve their communication skills , agrees			1
‘ we think we ’re getting something free and do n’t have the right to expect too much , ’ she says			0
‘ but it ’s not “ free ”			0
‘ it ’s part of the insurance we took out with the government — we ’ve all paid an awful lot into it			0
’ as for me , i believe the situation simply reflects how impersonal gp surgeries have become			0
providing forms to fill out , stating your level of satisfaction with all stages of a gp visit , might help.this way , patients could remain anonymous			2
after all , none of us wants to deal with confrontation and risk not getting an appointment			2
but until we do so — in a civilised way — and end the intimidation , this callousness will continue .			0

nursing broken bones , @entity236 was shocked by callous @entity205 receptionist
all too often waiting room staff are less guardian angels and more dragons
in 2012 complaints to family doctors were running at 1,000 per week
many patients are left feeling dehumanised and humiliated
getting an appointment becomes a frustrating struggle
