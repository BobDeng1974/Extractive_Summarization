a historic @entity1 launch that could change the way man gets to space blasted off today from @entity5 under perfect conditions			1
within minutes of liftoff , the @entity8 company was making its third attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean platform			1
but it did n't go to plan			0
billionaire founder , @entity15 , tweeted : ' @entity16 successful			0
@entity19 landed on droneship , but too hard for survival			0
the impact of landing , however , caused it to tip over destroying the lower part of the rocket			0
landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky			0
@entity1 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand			1
@entity15 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year			2
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks another step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs			1
' this might change completely how we approach transportation to space , ' @entity1 vice president @entity47 told reporters during a prelaunch press conference			1
@entity15 tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to @entity56			2
@entity15 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity62 ' in the @entity63 while the booster landing did n't go to plane , the launch was successful			1
it took place at 4.10 et from @entity5 under perfect conditions , after a attempt had to be scrubbed on monday due to lightning the 208ft ( 63 metre ) tall @entity74 rocket , carrying a @entity76 capsule , thundered off its seaside launch pad at @entity78 at 4:10 p.m. the @entity74 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing and science experiments to the @entity83 - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts			1
the supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on friday			1
the rocket was was due to take off yesterday , but the launch was scrubbed due to bad weather			0
on board the @entity91 is an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity83 astronaut @entity93 of @entity94			1
the @entity94 in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee - drinking in space			2
@entity1 , meanwhile , hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first - stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off @entity5 's northeastern coast , near @entity103			1
@entity76 - the only supply ship capable of returning items intact - will remain at the @entity83 until around may 21 at liftoff time , the orbiting lab was soaring over @entity107			1
the delivery of food and equipment will arrive friday soon after the launch , @entity15 tweeted : ' ascent successful			1
@entity19 landed on droneship , but too hard for survival ' @entity76 , the @entity1 supply ship , holds more than 4,000 pounds of food , science experiments and equipment for the six space station astronauts @entity15 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs			1
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity63 and sink			0
the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity62			1
' @entity76 — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around may 21			0
during a previous landing attempt in january , the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins , causing it to crash into the platform			1
a second attempt in february was called off because of high seas , but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart			0
@entity15 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs the launch sequence as it happened			0
all stages of the launch went to plan , except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket			0
@entity1 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand on board the @entity91 is an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity83 astronaut @entity93 of @entity94 the @entity159 machine uses a normal @entity161 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			0
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
@entity15 recently unveiled the images of the @entity74 failed landing after persuasion on @entity177 by the game pioneer behind @entity179 , @entity180			2
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt			0
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			0
@entity189 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			0
as well as the espresso machine , the @entity91 supply ship also holds experiments for @entity196 's one - year space station resident @entity197 , who moved in a couple weeks ago			1
@entity200 cosmonaut @entity199 also will remain on board until march 2016			0
this will be the @entity8 - based @entity1 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity78			2
@entity1 is one of two companies hired by @entity196 to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles			1
as well as a recently extended 15 - flight , $ 2 billion contract with @entity196 , @entity1 is working on a passenger version of the @entity91 and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit			2
the company also is working on a heavy - lift version of the @entity74 rocket , which uses 27 engines , compared to the nine currently flying			2
the @entity221 is expected to make its first test flight late this year			0
at @entity78 's @entity224 , a @entity74 rocket stands ready to boost a @entity91 on its fifth commercial resupply mission			2
this image was taken on monday , before the attempt was scrubbed due to bad weather this was @entity1 ' third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge			1
pictured is group 's first attempt to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea , which was held in position using deep - sea oil rigs			2
the attempt ended in fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion			0

@entity1 made its third attempt to land a booster on an ocean platform
but the booster tipped over after hitting its target and was destroyed
@entity74 is on its way to the @entity83 with supplies and will arrive friday
cargo includes first espresso machine designed for use in space
