by @entity0 follow @ @ laura_mail @entity1 managed to produce one of those eternally frustrating @entity4 performances that promise much and yet inevitably seem to result in crushing defeat			1
it ’s the hope that gets you , every time , whatever sport it happens to be			2
the 21 - year - old ’s blistering forehand helped her fight back to level the match at one set all against 2010 @entity14 finalist @entity13 overnight and she gained an early break of serve in the third when play resumed on @entity17 2 yesterday			1
but , serving for a place in the second round at 5 - 4 , an all - too familiar case of nerves overtook the @entity4 no 5			1
she slipped to 0 - 40 , had a let - off when @entity13 missed a forehand and then saved another break point , only to double fault and gift the game to her @entity29 opponent			1
deflated : @entity4 's @entity1 lost in the first round of @entity14 , despite serving for the match at one stage experience : @entity29 's @entity13 was just too much to handle for her opponent in the end @entity1 insisted @entity13 , a former world no 2 who has slipped to 566 in the rankings after two years dogged by injury , did not ‘ give her anything ’ but , although the @entity4 player managed to hold two further service games before losing 9 - 7 in the third set , the collective chorus of groans around @entity17 2 told the real story			1
after fighting so hard for two hours and 45 minutes over two days , the @entity48 had choked when it mattered most against an opponent whose pedigree certainly outshone her performance			1
both players had needed wildcards to make the main draw , but only one seized her opportunity with both hands			2
@entity1 , however , had only praise for @entity13 , who will meet @entity60 of @entity61 in the second round			1
‘ she played good on the big points , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ she did n’t give me anything			0
she made me work for everything			0
i think i did the same for her			0
she had to try very hard to beat me			0
she was no 2 in the world and i pushed her to her limits			0
‘ i was nervous out there obviously playing on a really big court and i am just very grateful to play on such a good court			0
‘ i hope that i ’ve really showed them that i wanted to be there and i tried my hardest			0
’ fist pump : @entity1 did manage to raise money for charity by producing this celebration on wednesday perhaps it was little wonder @entity1 was so upbeat after a day in which she earned £ 31,500 for losing in the first round of the singles and then in the ladies ’ doubles with partner @entity83			1
to her credit , however , her industry and bubbly personality also saw her raise £ 3,921 for the @entity87 , a charity in memory of @entity89 who died last month aged only 30			0
a mobile telephone company donated £ 3 each time @entity1 pumped her fist and then added a further £ 3,000 after she managed 307 such celebrations during her two matches on wednesday .			2
