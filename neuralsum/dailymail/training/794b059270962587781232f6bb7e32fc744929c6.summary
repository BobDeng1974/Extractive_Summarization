passed : prime minister @entity0 , pictured here leaving @entity1 today , has seen his gay marriage bill go through with the help of @entity4 and @entity5 @entity0 suffered a humiliating reverse last night when more than half his mps rejected his 11th - hour appeals for support for same - sex marriage			1
on an extraordinary day in the @entity12 , 134 @entity11 mps took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans			1
only 126 backed the legislation , with 35 abstaining			1
but with the help of the majority of @entity4 and @entity5 mps mr @entity0 saw the measure passed easily , by a margin of 400 to 175			1
the first gay marriages are likely to be conducted within 12 months			1
the standard bearer of the @entity23 , @entity24 , voted in favour of same - sex unions , but the government ’s top lawyer , @entity27 , astonished colleagues by abstaining			2
a source close to mr @entity27 said : ‘ he is a practising member of the @entity32 and it has caused a lot of hurt and upset for the church			2
’ cabinet ministers who voted against the measure included environment secretary @entity39 , who said privately some years ago in a discussion about gay marriage that ‘ biddies do n’t like botties ’ , and welsh secretary @entity44			1
they were joined by @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
mr @entity0 has been accused of needlessly splitting his party and prioritising an issue important to only a handful of voters			1
one poll suggests 70 per cent of voters now see the @entity54 as divided			0
despite the vote being deemed one of conscience , @entity11 @entity10 had been left in no doubt that the party leadership wanted as many as possible to vote in favour			1
senior ministers including @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 were wheeled out on the eve of the debate to make the case			0
senior @entity54 had suggested before the vote it was crucial for mr @entity0 to win over more than half of his party – a benchmark he failed to meet			1
however , several @entity54 who rejected the measure said they objected to being described as ‘ rebels ’ , since it was a free vote			2
@entity4 also suffered a split , with 22 of its mps voting against			1
only 126 backed the legislation , with 35 abstaining a handful of @entity5 – including former children ’s minister @entity90 – did likewise			1
the prime minister said : ‘ i am a strong believer in marriage			0
it helps people commit to each other and i think it is right that gay people should be able to get married too			2
‘ this is , yes , about equality			0
but it is also about making our society stronger			0
i know there are strong views on both side of the argument – i accept that			0
but this is an important step forward for our country			0
’ but @entity111 , the chairman of the @entity112 , expressed doubts over the government ’s assurances that faith groups will not be forced to conduct gay marriages			1
and @entity118 , the former @entity119 secretary , said : ‘ this legislation was not in our manifesto , it was not in the coalition agreement and it was not in the @entity126 ’s speech			0
’ sir @entity127 , @entity11 mp for @entity128 , accused mr @entity0 of an ‘ orwellian ’ attempt to redefine marriage			1
he prompted uproar as he suggested the government might as well allow civil unions between all people ‘ irrespective of their sexuality or their relationship ... that means brothers and brothers and sisters and sisters and brothers and sisters as well ’			0
@entity144 , a leading modernising mp , accused the @entity32 and anti-gay marriage campaigners of a ‘ deliberate ’ attempt to distort the debate by falsely claiming faith groups would be forced to conduct same - sex ceremonies			0
she warned the @entity151 risked alienating mainstream voters in the same way as @entity155 @entity154 if they failed to embrace social changes such as equal marriage			0
the mp for @entity159 , who is gay , told the @entity12 : ‘ my party should never flinch from the requirement that we must continue this progression , otherwise we may end up like the @entity154 who lost an election last year that they could have won were it not for their socially conservative agenda			2
’ deputy prime minister @entity167 said : ‘ we will look back on today as a landmark for equality in @entity170			0
’ labour leader @entity171 said : ‘ this is a proud day and an important step forward in the fight for equality in @entity170			0
’ @entity175 , of the @entity176 , which has opposed the legislation , said : ‘ this result is a disaster for @entity0			1
despite a personal plea from the pm his mps have overwhelmingly rejected gay marriage			1
mr @entity0 must think again			1
’ last night was not the first time mr @entity0 has gone into the commons division lobbies with a minority of his mps over gay rights			1
in 2007 , on a free vote , he was among fewer than half of his party who supported gay adoption			2
the previous biggest @entity11 split on a free vote was under mr @entity24 in 2003 , when the party split over reform of the @entity197			1
@entity198 suffered a bigger loss of support over foxhunting in 2004			0
looking back : deputy prime minister @entity167 said the day would be seen as a ' landmark for equality in @entity170 ' culture secretary @entity204 defended the plans for gay marriage in the commons @entity204 , tory culture secretary this @entity209 is about one thing			1
it is about fairness , it is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so while protecting the rights of those who do n’t agree with same - sex marriage			0
@entity218 , @entity11 former children 's minister who are we , this government , or this country , to redefine the term marriage that has meant one man and one woman across cultures , across ages , across geographical barriers since before state and religion themselves ? @entity234 , @entity4 's @entity235 ‘ call us hopeless romantics , call it the triumph of hope over experience – most of us think when people love each other and want to make that long - term commitment , that is a wonderful thing			1
so why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay ? @entity249 , labour mp for heywood and @entity252 the government can not possibly guarantee protection for churches or individuals with a traditional view because it can not predict or control what happens in the courts			2
@entity260 , @entity11 mp for @entity128 it is not possible to redefine marriage			2
marriage is the union between a man and a woman , has been historically , remains so			0
it is @entity269 territory , orwellian almost , for any government of any political persuasion to seek to come along and try to re-write the lexicon			0
@entity274 , @entity11 mp for @entity275 we should be in the business of protecting cherished institutions and our cultural heritage otherwise what , i ask , is a @entity11 for ? indeed we are alienating people who have voted for us for all their lives , leaving them with no one to vote for			2
@entity286 , @entity287 are heterosexual couples going to say ? ‘ darling our marriage is over , sir @entity290 has just gotten married to @entity291 ” ? @entity4 's equalities spokesman @entity234 asked : ' why would we stop a loving couple getting married just because they are gay ? ' @entity295 , labour mp for east ham children are at the heart of marriage ... but they are barely mentioned at the @entity209			1
the @entity209 aims to open up the benefits of marriage to people excluded from it at the moment but it is doing at the price of taking away a significant part of its meaning			0
’ @entity310 , @entity11 mp for @entity311 it is my saddest day as an mp when my party brings in a @entity209 which i ’m fundamentally opposed to			1
i ’m very sad my party has brought this in without any democratic mandate			0
@entity318 , @entity320 defence minister @entity319 is wrong , the consultation process was a complete sham , it is opposed by the established church , it has caused deep and needless divisions within the @entity11 , there is no mandate for it , there are huge potential consequences , not least the prospect of endless legal challenge and the nation faces much more serious challenges which the government needs to address			1
@entity334 , labour mp for @entity336 north east the love that two men or two women feel for each other is equal to that felt by a heterosexual couple			0
their love is no less significant and no less important			0
@entity345 , @entity11 mp for @entity346 a factor of at least 30 to one my constituents have expressed their opposition to this			2
huge numbers of @entity112 supporters feel grave disappointment and alienation at the decision to pursue this legislation			0
@entity357 , @entity11 mp for @entity358 of further redefinitions ? will this be the last redefinition of marriage ? i understand in the @entity363 and @entity364 three way relationships are being legally recognised			2
’ @entity368 , @entity11 mp for @entity369 for conservatives to work , we have to accept that the world changes			2
if we do n’t we become an anachronism .			0

134 @entity11 mps opposed and 126 backed the plans , with 35 abstaining
@entity0 sees the measure passed with the help of @entity4 and @entity5
