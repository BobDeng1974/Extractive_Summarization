scientists have shown , for the first time , that parents ' children can resemble the mother 's previous partner - at least in neriid flies			1
this controversial idea , known as telegony , dates back to ancient @entity10 times , but was discredited in the early @entity11 with the advent of genetics			2
however scientists found that the size of young neriid flies was determined by the size of the first male the mother mated with , rather than the second male that fathered the offspring			1
scientists from the @entity23 claim that the controversial theory of telegony could be true			1
this suggests a female 's previous male partner decides some of the characteristics of offspring she has with the next			1
this was based on evidence from young neriid flies ( shown ) the scientists from the @entity23 in @entity33 tested the theory by manipulating the size of male flies , and studying their offspring			1
' our discovery complicates our entire view of how variation is transmitted across generations , but also opens up exciting new possibilities and avenues of research , ' said lead author dr @entity46			0
' just as we think we have things figured out , nature throws us a curve ball and shows us how much we still have to learn			0
' the researchers propose that the phenomenon is due to molecules in the seminal fluid of the first mate being absorbed by the female 's immature eggs , and then influencing the growth of offspring of a subsequent mate			1
@entity60 is a widely discredited idea that suggests children of a particular species can inherit characteristics from a mother â€™s previous mate			1
the theory was popular in the 19th century but , with an increased understanding of genetics in the 20th century , it has been viewed as inconsistent with current theories			1
several experiments have failed to prove any evidence of telegony			0
meanwhile a statistical investigation of telegony in humans found no correlation and ruled out the idea			2
the latest research , however , will be food for thought for some who had previously declared telegony an impossibility			0
the study was published in the journal @entity86			0
the team produced large and small male flies by feeding them diets as larvae that were high or low in nutrients			0
they then mated the immature females with either a large or a small male			0
once the females had matured , they were mated again with either a big or a small male , and their offspring were studied			2
' we found that even though the second male sired the offspring , offspring size was determined by what the mother 's previous mating partner ate as a maggot , ' dr @entity46			1
despite major advances in genetics , many questions remain about how some traits are inherited			1
' we know that features that run in families are not just influenced by the genes that are passed down from parents to their children , ' dr @entity109 added			0
' various non-genetic inheritance mechanisms make it possible for maternal or paternal environmental factors to influence characteristics of a child			0
' in the flies , for example , it has been shown that males that are well - fed as larvae go on to produce big offspring			0
' our new findings take this to a whole new level - showing a male can also transmit some of his acquired features to offspring sired by other males , ' she says			0
' but we do n't know yet whether this applies to other species			2
' the idea of telegony - that a male can leave a mark on his mate 's body that influences her offspring to a different male - originated with the @entity10 philosopher @entity143			2
it was a concern to royalty in the 1300s and still popular as a scientific hypothesis in the 1800s but rejected in the early 1900s as incompatible with the new science of genetics			0
