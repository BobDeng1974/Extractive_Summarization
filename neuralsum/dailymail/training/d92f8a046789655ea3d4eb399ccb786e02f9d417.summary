he has dedicated his life to uncovering the mysteries of the universe and has unearthed some of the greatest scientific finds of our time by studying outer space			1
so it is perhaps fitting that professor @entity10 should want to spend his final moments drifting among the moon , stars and planets he has always been so fascinated by			2
the astrophysicist has revealed that he 's been offered a trip into space aboard @entity19 ’s @entity18 - and far from being daunted by the prospect , he added that he would be quite happy if this was the way he died			1
i was due to go into space with @entity18 , courtesy of @entity19 , but i fear the doctors wo n’t allow it			1
it would be a good way to go			0
' in fact , the astrophysicist reckons we should all start thinking about making the trip to space if the human race has any hope of surviving the next thousand years			1
he added : ' the human race faces great dangers			0
i do n’t think it will survive another thousand years unless it spreads out into space , so that all its eggs are not in one basket , or on one planet			2
' professor @entity10 , 72 , who is widely considered the most famous living scientist , was speaking ahead of the @entity54 , which brings together some of the most brilliant minds in astronomy			1
he will be speaking about quantum theory , and how this allows for the extraordinary idea of the existence of many possible universes			2
' in a sense , they all exist together , ' he said			0
' many of them are unsuitable for any form of life			0
thus our presence selects the small subset compatible with our existence			0
this is called the @entity73			0
' professor @entity10 , 72 , was speaking ahead of the @entity54 , which brings together some of the most brilliant minds in astronomy the festival will see @entity10 joined by the likes of @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity82 winners @entity80 and sir @entity83 , and astronauts @entity84 and @entity86 from the @entity88 and @entity89 16 missions			1
with past speakers including @entity91 and @entity92 , @entity54 - which this year takes place in the @entity94 between 22 and 28 september - has become one of the most important dates in the astronomy calender			1
but it 's not all hard work			0
@entity10 revealed that - with @entity79 and @entity101 among their numbers - the scientists would have plenty of time to kick back and relax with some live music in the @entity107 sunshine			0
he said : ' the science community is dedicated and serious , but it can let its hair down , and enjoy itself			2
' [ at @entity54 ] we will unwind by listening to rock music , and watching dance grounds			1
it is extreme , like @entity117 of whom i ’m also a fan			0
' @entity10 , who has famously said that he finds women a ' complete mystery ' , also took the opportunity to express his concerns that there are still not enough girls choosing to follow a career in science			1
' it worries me that there are few women in science , he said			1
' the reasons are partly historical , but i do n’t think they can entirely explain why fewer girls than boys take physics and mathematics at a-level			0
they are not seen as feminine subjects			0
' to counter this , my daughter and i have written a series of science - based adventure stories for children , with a girl heroine , @entity143 , who explores the universe			2
' but @entity10 added the he was ' encouraged ' to note that there are increasing numbers of women in astrophysics			1
he said : ' we have coffee mornings every day for those in cosmology , astrophysics or theoretical physics			2
although the majority are men , there are many more women than when i began research			2
we have weekly informal lunchtime seminars , almost half the speakers are women			2
' @entity19 has invited @entity10 to travel into space - but the scientist is afraid his doctors will not allow it professor @entity10 is widely considered to be the most famous living scientist @entity79 and @entity167 will be two of the live music acts performing at the @entity54 festival professor @entity10 was diagnosed with @entity172 - a form of @entity172 - shortly after his 21st birthday			1
but in spite of being wheelchair bound and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication he has become one of the world 's most renowned physicists			0
the astrophysicist has published three best - selling books - including the well - known @entity184 - and has been awarded with a number of honorary degrees , medals , and a cbe in 1982			1
he has also made cameos in @entity190 and @entity191 , as well as making time for his three children and three grandchildren			0
astrophysicist @entity194 , founder and director of the @entity54 , said he could n't quite believe it when @entity10 agreed to speak at the festival and credits him with raising the profile of the event			1
' people love @entity10 , everyone knows him , ' mr @entity200 said			2
' he is a symbol of someone who can fight			0
astronaut @entity91 made a one of his very rare appearances at the first @entity54 festival in 2011 @entity207 is another famous astronaut to have spoken at the inaugural @entity54 festival but although @entity54 will see some high - profile speakers take to the stage , mr @entity209 explained that amateur astronomers were at the heart of the festival			1
he said : ' there are no events like this where we can get amateurs and huge names all together			0
it ’s important to remember that it 's a festival not a conference			2
' it ’s just a big party where you learn			0
we have tried to combine pleasure with education and make sure everything is fun			0
we let people enjoy their time during the day and then they are invited to listen to four really high profile speakers each evening			0
' professor @entity10 agreed that this was the aim of @entity54 and insisted that he will be directing his talks at an amateur audience			1
he said : ' i hope the non-specialist audience takes away the idea that the origin of the universe did not require the hand of @entity244 , but can be explained by the laws of science			0
' a @entity54 book with a foreword by @entity10 is being published in time for the festival			1
@entity78 is sure to provide some interesting insights in the @entity94 later this month @entity18 has the ambitious aim to become the world 's first commercial spaceline @entity10 has dedicated his life to uncovering the mysteries of the universe and unearthed some of the greatest scientific finds of our time by studying outer space			1

astrophysicist said he would love to go to the moon or outer space
but he fears that doctors will not allow him to make the trip
will be speaking at the @entity54 festival later this month
has also expressed his concern that there are not more women in science
but he is ' encouraged ' to see number of women in astrophysics increasing
