perhaps the only surprising thing is that it ’s taken this long for the usual suspects to come out and start bashing the artistic triumph of the year			2
but then , it really must stick in the craw of our metropolitan cultural elite that after all those years of championing so much talentless twaddle — pickled sharks , unmade beds , etc — along comes a work of art which really does capture the public imagination			2
it ’s a dazzling exercise in originality and creativity which has already attracted four million visitors			1
and , horror of horrors , it ’s about war			2
not only that , it has been produced by an artist who has never even made it to the shortlist of that exalted yardstick of contemporary art , the @entity26			1
worse still , @entity28 ’s ceramic poppies , now filling the moat of the @entity30 as a memorial to every @entity33 and colonial serviceman who died in the @entity34 , have been installed in a royal fortress			1
and the public — those ungrateful , ill - educated fools — have been queueing up in their thousands every day just to catch a glimpse			1
the poppy display at the @entity30 has attracted thousands of visitors - but one critic has trashed the stunning work as ' fake ' the poppies are now filling the moat of the @entity30 as a memorial to every @entity33 and colonial serviceman who died in the @entity34 but former @entity26 judge @entity46 , art critic of the @entity47 , said the work was an ' inward - looking , @entity50 - type memorial ' he wrote : ‘ the moat of the @entity30 should be filled with barbed wire and bones			1
that would mean something ' now , a former @entity26 judge can stand it no longer			1
@entity46 , art critic of the @entity47 , has trashed the work as a ‘ fake , inward - looking , @entity50 - type memorial ’ which demeans us all			1
‘ it is deeply disturbing that a hundred years on from 1914 , we can only mark this terrible war as a national tragedy , ’ he writes on the @entity47 website			1
‘ what does it say about @entity33 in 2014 that we still narrowly remember our own dead and do not mourn the @entity67 or @entity68 or @entity69 victims ? it ’s the inward - looking mood that lets @entity50 thrive			2
’ he goes on to attack the ‘ fake nobility ’ of this ‘ deeply aestheticised , prettified and toothless war memorial ’			1
dismissing the entire thing as ‘ a lie ’ , he suggests a replacement : ‘ the moat of the @entity30 should be filled with barbed wire and bones			1
’ many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project , any more than someone might quibble with the @entity79			0
some chapters in the history of this country are of such a different order and magnitude that they transcend the petty squabbles of @entity90 and @entity91			0
the death of close to a million men and women in the @entity34 is one of them			1
so too , for that matter , were this year ’s commemorations of the 70th anniversary of @entity100			0
we mark these moments not to enshrine some political doctrine , and certainly not to celebrate victory , but simply to express our thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice			0
in doing so , we honour the eternal pledge : ‘ we will remember them			0
’ yet there will always be that bien pensant strand among our chattering classes who simply ‘ know better ’ and can not allow such moments to pass without imposing their oh - so - enlightened contemporary take on it all			2
as it happens , after reading mr @entity46 ’s words , i remembered that he also dismissed the new @entity120 ( backed by generous @entity122 readers ) as ‘ crass ’ and ‘ a nasty piece of artistic jingoism ’			1
not that the bomber boys had cause to worry			0
that has also turned out to be a phenomenally popular addition to the @entity129 landscape			0
but then , this is the same critic who , earlier this month , likened @entity132 ( of unmade bed fame ) to @entity134			2
with thousands flocking to the site each day to see the emerging 888,246 poppies , many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project the work , created by @entity28 , is to simply express thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice - without political agenda the exhibition ( left ) , called @entity147 , has attracted massive crowds ( right ) , particularly during half - term the sea of crimson poppies can be seen from @entity151 - a beacon of colour in the more grey @entity129 surroundings @entity166 ’s famous dictum — ‘ it is unquestionably true that almost any @entity157 intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “ @entity163 ” than of stealing from a poor box ’ — remains as true today as it was when he wrote it during the @entity162			1
why is it that the @entity90 have such a loathing for home - grown patriotism while they are so keen to salute it elsewhere ? why is it still thought to be cool ( after all these years ) to have that clapped - out hero of the @entity175 revolution , @entity176 , on your wall or your t - shirt , while decrying ‘ @entity181 the warmonger ’ for liberating the @entity180 ? even among the @entity90 , there is sometimes a sense that all this commemoration stuff is a bit phoney			2
@entity187 saw nothing wrong with merging the 60th anniversaries of @entity190 and @entity191 in 2005 into a single , non-specific event to save time and money			0
the veterans were appalled , yet the prime minister of the day could not understand why			0
back in the @entity197 , the @entity90 were urging us all to ‘ move on ’ and downgrade @entity199			0
in 1982 , after the @entity201 , the @entity200 decided to switch conductors after musical director @entity203 had called for the abolition of ‘ jingoistic ’ flag - waving at the @entity206			2
even today , there are strident voices insisting that the school curriculum should no longer teach 1918 as a ‘ victory ’			0
and nothing gets this @entity213 lot going quite like a poppy			0
whether it ’s the right - on crowd who insist on wearing white poppies ( to honour pacifism ) in the run - up to @entity221 or those , like @entity224 ’s @entity223 , who refuse to wear one at all ( on grounds of ‘ poppy fascism ’ ) , there will always be some people who want to be different			1
no one should dispute their right to do so			0
such freedoms of expression are why those wars were fought in the first place			0
even the protester who burnt poppies in front of @entity239 fundraisers outside the @entity240 on @entity199 2010 — shouting ‘ burn in hell , @entity33 soldiers ’ — was only fined £ 50 for threatening behaviour ( he ’d have been fined more if he ’d parked on a double yellow line while doing so )			2
but that does n’t mean we should let patronising side - swipes pass unchallenged			2
the @entity248 was so impressed with the ceramic installation that she and the @entity250 had a private tour her majesty looked contemplative as she toured the poppies earlier this month			1
the poppies will be sold to raise money for charity the @entity250 and @entity257 visited the memorial alongside @entity259 , walking through the now - colourful dry moat so what if the sea of poppies at the @entity30 is a @entity33 commemoration ? every nation honours the dead in its own way			1
think of the profoundly moving tradition which takes place every night of every year in @entity270			0
except for the duration of the @entity162 , the buglers of the @entity272 have appeared each evening at the town ’s @entity274			0
there , the traffic stops and the people of this proud town salute all the @entity33 who fell in @entity280			0
to date , i have never heard anyone condemn them as a bunch of @entity50 - supporting simpletons			2
maybe it ’s only a matter of time			0
the @entity30 project was dreamt up by ceramicist @entity28 only a year ago , as he pondered a fitting tribute for the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity34			1
his idea was to plant a ceramic poppy for every @entity33 and colonial serviceman who died in the @entity34 , then sell them to raise funds for charities linked to the @entity299			1
the trustees of @entity301 , which runs the @entity30 , quickly embraced the idea			1
more than that , the @entity30 authorities have created a ritual whereby , every night , the names of dead soldiers are recited from a lectern overlooking the poppies			1
anyone can nominate a loved one			0
in stirring scenes , @entity312 , the star of @entity313 , also visited the poppies - one of several high profile visitors to the installation visitors have been taking photos in their thousands to document the snippet of history now laid out in central @entity129 the project has attracted enormous international attention , despite mr @entity46 's assertions that it is nationalistic mr @entity46 also attacked the ‘ fake nobility ’ of this ‘ deeply aestheticised , prettified and toothless war memorial ’ , calling it ' a lie ' the whole project is an idea which so impressed the @entity248 that she asked for a guided tour			1
and despite @entity46 ’s assertion that it is a nationalistic , @entity336 - only affair , it has attracted enormous international attention			1
the man from the @entity47 had not even planned to see it			1
‘ i accidentally got swept into a tide of humanity at the weekend , or to put it another way , could n’t move for crowds , ’ he wrote			0
‘ what was going on ? why were so many people choking the streets of the @entity347 , where shops are closed on saturdays ? ’ how frightful for the poor chap			0
well , i just so happened to be down there myself during this same weekend			0
i saw the poppies back in the summer and wanted to bring my children before the whole thing disappears in a fortnight			2
and i could think of no better way to impress upon them the enormity of the @entity34 than to show them this crimson moat and explain that every single one of the 888,246 poppies equals a real person who lived and died for this country			1
it is an image which will be imprinted on countless young minds for many years to come			0
yet after @entity199 on november 11 , the poppies will be uprooted , cleaned and dispatched to the people who have paid £ 25 for each one			2
within weeks , this extraordinary display will be gone , unlike @entity372 ’s pickled shark and @entity132 ’s unmade bed , which will for better or worse live on to delight future generations			0
which , though , will most people remember 100 years from now ?			0

temporary war memorial @entity147 and @entity380 at @entity30 has attracted thousands of visitors
installation will see 888,246 ceramic poppies filling @entity30 's moat to commemorate those who died in @entity34
but @entity47 art critic @entity46 has trashed the ' toothless ' memorial as ' fake ' , ' inward - looking ' and ' a lie '
in a seething attack , the former @entity26 judge suggests the moat should be filled with ' barbed wire and bones '
