@entity0 has had another close encounter with an asteroid			1
asteroid 2013 @entity3 is between 10 to 17 metres wide - roughly the same size as the one which exploded above @entity9 's @entity8 mountains last month , injuring 1,000 people			1
it was discovered on march 2 , and passed between the moon and sun 246,000 miles away in the early hours of this morning			2
' that we are finding all these asteroids recently does not mean that we are being visited by more asteroids , ' said @entity28 from the @entity29			0
' just that our ability to detect them has gotten so much better			0
' our technology has improved a lot over the past decades			0
' ' of course , we knew well there were no risks for our precious planet			0
' over the years , our ability to find these small asteroids increases , this is why we count more and more , as time goes			0
' hopefully , the surveys surfing the skies to find them will have better and better funding , as well as space missions to hunt for them from space and projects to mitigate any potential collision risk			0
the asteroid identified as 2013 @entity3 was discovered by @entity51 's @entity50 on saturday			1
similar to the @entity9 meteor that hit two weeks ago , it passed @entity0 at an approximate distance of the moon 's orbit monday , mar. 4 , at 2:35 a.m. et ( 7:35 a.m. utc )			1
landing : local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity61 and @entity62 regions			0
the asteroid landed in a frozen lake terrifying : a meteorite shower hit @entity9 injuring at least 100 people , including school children it is thought to be between 10 - 17 meters wide			1
the @entity9 meteor was 17 meter wide with a mass of 10,000 tons before entering @entity0 's atmosphere			1
more than a thousand people were injured as the sonic wave caused by the explosion collapsed roofs and shook buildings in the @entity8 region in @entity9			1
more than a hundred thousand asteroids have been discovered so far			0
an asteroid @entity80 , nicknamed as ‘ the doomsday asteroid ’ , was observed by the @entity83 ’s @entity82 and a study claimed that there is 2.7 percent chance of it colliding with @entity0			2
but further studies dismissed this and claim that the asteroid will definitely not strike @entity0 in 2036			2
loudest ever infrasonic shockwave : this image from a @entity9 driver 's dashboard camera shows the explosion caused as a meteorite burned up in the atmosphere over central @entity9 a fortnight ago			2

asteroid 2013 @entity3 is between 10 to 17 metres wide - roughly the same size as the one which exploded above @entity9 's @entity8 mountains last month , injuring 1,000 people
passed between the moon and @entity0 at 7:37am this morning
