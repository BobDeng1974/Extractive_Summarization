' the sight of @entity183 in the @entity191 is a stark reminder of what a no vote means - @entity11 - led governments people in @entity4 do n't vote for , imposing policies we do n't support and charging us for the privilege , ' he said			0

' however , last night it emerged an independent @entity4 would be blocked from joining the @entity12 if @entity40 ploughs ahead with his ' bonkers idea ' of using the pound			0
the pound tumbled to a near five - month low on the shock poll showing a narrowing in the no campaign 's lead the latest @entity46 poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the no campaign ahead of the independence referendum on september 18 @entity222 chief @entity221 warned it ' would simply not be possible ' to become an @entity12 nation if @entity225 did not have control of its own currency			1

mr @entity221 insisted that any country which wants to join the @entity12 must be ' committed ' to the @entity254 of the @entity12			0
it means they must have the ' will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course ' as well as their own independent central bank			0
but if @entity4 is using the pound governed from @entity264 , it will not have control of bits own currency			0
mr @entity221 added : ' as to the question whether ' sterlingisation ' were compatible with @entity12 membership , the answer is that this would simply not be possible , since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the @entity254			0
