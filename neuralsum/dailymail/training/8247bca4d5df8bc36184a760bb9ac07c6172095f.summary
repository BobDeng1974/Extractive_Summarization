dear mr. @entity12 , all of us at the @entity65 for @entity66 ( @entity116 ) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family , @entity2 , who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia			1
individuals affected by these rare , genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance , which others may consider “ different			0
” bullying is never acceptable and we , as a nation , have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying			0
however , to be called out on a celebrity ’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible			0
we applaud @entity2 for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “ hug do n’t judge			2
” mr. @entity12 , we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change			0
the ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair , teeth , skin , glands and nails in men , women and children of all races and ethnic groups			2
of the more than 180 different syndromes , x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( @entity160 ) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth , the inability to perspire , sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections			1
symptoms can range from mild to severe , but in all cases present a variety of challenges			0
we invite you to attend our @entity170 , july 23 - 26 in @entity171 , @entity172 , and meet families from around the world who , like @entity2 , are affected by ectodermal dysplasias			2
you will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas , daunting physical challenges , and financially draining dental procedures they ’re up against			0
you might want to consider making something positive come from this			0
consider giving @entity2 the gift of a smile , one that others would not make fun of			0
give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride			0
we are urging our @entity116 community to use this opportunity to raise awareness , to make positive change , and to support @entity2 ’s “ hug do n’t judge ” campaign ( # hugdontjudge )			1
we encourage you to do the same			0
