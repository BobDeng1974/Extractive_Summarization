what we need is presidential leadership			0
the person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the @entity39			0
' ' we should be less concerned about giving the public the feeling that the government is on top of this , ' @entity7 said , ' and more concerned about the government actually being on top of it			0

' ' there is a very steep learning curve ' for @entity0 , he added			0
@entity7 rep. @entity125 of @entity126 said sunday on the @entity127 ' face the @entity129 ' program that @entity0 also lacks ' emergency response experience			2
