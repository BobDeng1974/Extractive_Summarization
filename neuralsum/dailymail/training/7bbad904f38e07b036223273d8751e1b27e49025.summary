a controversial plan to segregate all people wearing face coverings inside @entity3 has been dumped			1
the security overhaul , which one mp labelled ' religious apartheid ' , was abandoned after mounting criticism			1
however , the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) which sets security protocols says all visitors to @entity3 will now be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features			1
the decision taken by the speaker and @entity33 president @entity32 to restrict anyone wearing facial coverings to a glassed - in area of @entity3 has now been rescinded and replaced with new rules @entity33 president @entity32 was asked to reconsider the ' burqa ban ' by prime minister @entity39			1
that security measure has now been rescinded in favour of new rules the @entity8 says this will enable security staff to identify anyone who may have been previously banned from entering the building or who may be known to be a security risk			0
' once this process has taken place visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building , including all chamber galleries , with facial coverings in place			1
' the new security arrangements reverse a decision announced on october 2 to seat people wearing coverings such as a burqa in glassed - off areas , normally reserved for noisy school children			1
that decision - made by speaker @entity28 and @entity33 president @entity32 - came after more than week of heated debate about the potential security risk posed by burqas			2
prime minister @entity39 , who labelled the burqa as ' confronting ' , intervened in the matter , requesting a review of the decision after it prompted widespread outrage			0
but deputy opposition leader @entity71 ridiculed mr @entity39 's comments regarding the burqa being confronting			0
' i 'd prefer if @entity39 did n't get about in his speedos either , but it 's a free country , ' she said			0
prime minister @entity39 calls the burqa ' confronting ' but asked the @entity28 , @entity28 and the @entity33 president , to reconsider the ban inside parts of @entity3 the @entity8 says the security measures for @entity3 have now been ' enhanced '			1
procedures are in place to ensure that security manage the arrangements in a ' sensitive and appropriate manner '			2
the official circular from the @entity8 states that the new rules are effective immediately : ' further to the circular of 2 october 2014 providing for interim access arrangements to the private areas and public galleries at @entity3 , the @entity87 met yesterday and enhanced those arrangements			2
this circular replaces the circular of 2 october with effect from 8.30am monday 20 october 2014			0
' the new interim arrangements are as follows : ( a ) the renewal and issue of sponsored passes remains suspended			0
( b ) photographic identification is required for the issue of escorted passes for all adult visitors			0
( c ) all visitors entering @entity3 will be required to temporarily remove any coverings that prevent the recognition of facial features			1
this will enable @entity8 security staff to identify any person who may have been banned from entering @entity3 or who may be known , or discovered , to be a security risk			2
once this process has taken place , visitors are free to move about the public spaces of the building , including all chamber galleries , with facial coverings in place			1
new procedures have come into force on monday at @entity3 in @entity122 requiring anyone wearing a facial covering like a burqa to remove it temporarily for identification before being allowed in ' procedures are still in place to ensure that @entity8 security manage these procedures in a sensitive and appropriate manner			1
' these measures are designed to enhance and strengthen the existing access , identification and security arrangements at @entity3			1
further amendments and enhancements to pass policy and broader security practice will be implemented in due course			2
' deputy opposition leader @entity71 and @entity141 senate @entity139 hold distinctly opposite views when it comes to the wearing of the burqa the government was accused of inflaming tensions with the @entity148 community when it was revealed the proposed restrictions , which would have forced women wearing head coverings to view chambers of parliament from the glassed - in gallery , following a series of high - profile security - related raids across @entity158 and @entity159			1
' i asked the speaker to re-think that decision and my understanding is that it was an interim decision , ' mr @entity39 said at the time			0
mr @entity39 said the burqa was something he wished people chose not to wear , but said it was not the role of government to tell people what to wear outside of secure buildings			0
the restrictions were criticised by @entity148 groups and opposition members of parliament , including independent mp @entity177 , who called them a form of ' religious apartheid '			2
among those who had thrown their weight behind a proposed ban was controversial @entity141 senator @entity139 who labelled it a ' national security issue '			0
' it is like a motorbike helmet			0
it is like a balaclava , ' she said during the debate ' i will not allow you to wear that into my office because it is a security risk			0

@entity199 ban dumped after outrage over ' religious apartheid '
new ' enhanced ' security measures have been implemented
those wearing facial coverings and watching proceedings in @entity3 were to be restricted to a glassed - in area reserved for children
new screening procedures are in place forcing anyone with a facial covering to remove it temporarily for identification
