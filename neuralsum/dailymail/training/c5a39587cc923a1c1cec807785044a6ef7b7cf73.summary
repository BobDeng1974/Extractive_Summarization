by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 10:04 est , 24 july 2012 self starter : at 13 @entity2 was already making $ 1,500 a month as an it consultant for software developer @entity2 , life has played virtually like a video game , with a new character on every level			1
from parental divorcee to computer hacker , convicted criminal to @entity11 intelligence analyst , @entity13 agent to multimillionaire - the 37 - year - old knows how to role - play			1
at 13 he was already earning $ 1,500 a month as an it consultant			1
he even managed to persuade his school to let him ' formalise the computer club ' and run his business from there			0
with an 18 - year - old girlfriend , pockets full of cash and friends aplenty he began skipping school and staying out late into the night			2
then his parents issued him with an ultimatum : if he wanted to live under their roof he had to give it all up and focus on school			2
' i went to court and proved to a judge i was responsible enough to be on my own , ' he told the @entity34			0
alone and with nobody to reign him in , he turned his knack for computers into low - level hacking			0
but his solo activities soon caught the attentions of the online criminal underworld and he was swiftly recruited into a criminal hacking collective			0
he and his accomplices began hacking the sites of big business and military , including the systems of major banks , @entity49 and @entity50			0
for this 14 - year - old nothing was out of bounds			2
then early one morning there was a bang on the door			0
naked and bleary eyed , @entity2 answered and was bundled to the ground by an @entity58 tactical squad armed with @entity60 sub-machine guns			2
when you 're that young , because your parents always give you warnings , you expect someone to say , hey , knock it off			2
i never expected any action like that			0
' and because he was now divorced from his parents , he was officially a 14 - year - old adult			1
off the rails : @entity2 soon earned a reputation in the online criminal underworld and was recruited into a feared hacking collective infiltrating the sites of big business and military ( stock image ) he was found guilty of 45 counts of technical burglary and sentenced to 45 years in jail			1
but he says the judge saw a spark inside the troubled and neglected child and decided to give him a chance of atonement			0
after a year in juvenile detention , he was released on a suspended sentence and offered a spot in the military on the condition that he would not commit another crime			0
' for me , it was a no - brainer , ' he says			0
' i knew if i went to maximum security for youth , a guy like me probably would n't have a good experience			0
' @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity13 hq : by the age of 20 , @entity2 was working for the @entity13 tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in @entity106 and the @entity107 as soon as he was eligible , he joined the @entity11 and was swiftly stationed in the intelligence division , responsible for tracking money wired between warlords and radical sheiks in @entity106 and the @entity107			1
from there he was drafted into ' penetration testing on military installations ' , in some of the first stages of technological warfare			0
however , by the late 1990s , it began to dawn on @entity2 that he wanted to make more of his life than propping up the establishment and started one of the first commercial websites focused on financial markets with his brother			1
in 1999 they sold it for tens of millions of dollars			1
passion for games : after 9/11 he designed a computer simulation for the @entity13 to imitate ' @entity130 getting hit with a dirty bomb ' using a game engine by the company that developed @entity134 ( pictured ) but the draw of the government dollar pulled him back after 9/11 and he designed a military computer simulation to imitate ' @entity130 getting hit with a dirty bomb and how rescuers could lock down the city ' he had such fun with the simulation game , based on a game engine by the company that developed @entity134 , that he decided to focus all his powers on making virtual worlds			1
he says the draw of interactive entertainment is ' allowing people to create their own worlds [ ... ] like watching ants from above '			0
now @entity2 runs game development firm @entity152 , a company that turns over more than $ 10 million a year			1
' i was an intelligent , rebellious youth , but my grades and attendance records were n't the sole indicators for my potential contribution to society , ' he says			2
' ultimately , society suffers when we 're that myopic [ but ] when you look a little deeper , as people did with me , you 're able to get kids focused on their potential			1
' his company also works closely with ' troubled youth ' , mentoring teens to help them find their way to engage because ' that 's something i owe to the people who helped me			1
