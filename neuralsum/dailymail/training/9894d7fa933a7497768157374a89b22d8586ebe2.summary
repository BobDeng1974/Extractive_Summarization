by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 11:05 est , 24 may 2012 new boundaries : @entity2 was convinced that allowing a partner to sleep with other people was the only route to happiness - but has changed her mind @entity2 believed so strongly that humans are not built to be faithful that she appeared on television and wrote books advocating open relationships			1
the @entity13 author claimed that the only healthy way to have a modern relationship was to allow your partner to have sex with other people , and do the same yourself			2
but after insisting that allowing her boyfriend to cheat three nights a week kept them strong , she now admits it destroyed them			0
so what changed ? ms @entity2 became an ' anti monogamist ' after an ill - fated fling with a married man in 2006			1
@entity31 * never intended to leave his wife , she revealed , but wanted to sleep with somebody else			0
after a painful break - up , ms @entity2 was determined to use her psychology degree from the @entity36 to find out why			1
she came to the conclusion that men were hardwired to need sex from more than one person , and that humans were not made to have exclusive relationships			0
ms @entity2 shared that view with anyone who would listen , and shocked and angered many commentators as she expounded her theories on @entity47 and @entity48			1
she wrote a novel , @entity50 , about her year - long adventures with older men , and another called @entity53			0
but now her dogmatic opinion has completely changed , she told @entity56 magazine in an interview			0
ms @entity2 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity58 * , drew up a contract to determine how they would operate			1
they vetoed anything they felt would make them jealous - in ms @entity2 's case , her partner taking other women on romantic weekends away or buying them gifts			1
she told @entity47 in 2010 : ' one of the main things that i have learned is that a woman that negotiates infidelity with her partner is far more powerful than a woman who is sitting home wondering why he 's late from the office @entity79			1
' it 's better to walk the dog on a leash than let it escape through an unseen hole in the back fence			0
' miserable : the author admitted she became paranoid about other women , while her boyfriend felt emasculated watching her meet men ( posed by models ) new romantic : now ms @entity2 says she is looking for love with just one man but rather than eliminating jealousy , ms @entity2 became completely paranoid , shedding two stone in weight and obsessively comparing herself to the other women @entity58 was seeing			1
she said : ' i was staggered by the effect our infidelity was having on me			2
i 'd committed myself to the belief that monogamy was outdated and to have to even consider i was wrong was incredibly tough			0
' her boyfriend , who had previously enjoyed watching her flirt with other men at parties , now said he felt emasculated by the situation - and last summer they split			1
' i was devastated , ' said ms @entity2			2
' when it was just the two of us our relationship was incredible			0
but we 'd ruined it by being " unfaithful " - ironically , the one thing i thought would save our relationship			0
' the two are still friends abd @entity112 is now seeing a woman who isists on monogamy - something @entity58 says has actually restored his confidence			0
ms @entity2 , too , is dating somebody new , and is feeling optimistic about doing things very differently			2
' finally , ' she says , ' i feel like i can see a happy relationship with one man			2

@entity2 was convinced ' negotiated infidelity ' was the only way *forward*
now she is looking for love with one man
she says she became paranoid and her partner felt emasculated
