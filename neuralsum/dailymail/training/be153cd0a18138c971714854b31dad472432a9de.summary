there have been four @entity1 in @entity2 and each has been won by a @entity2 team			1
that is about to change			0
not because a @entity6 country is certain to claim the trophy in @entity8			1
the hosts and @entity10 remain favourites , we know that			1
yet even if a @entity2 team is victorious again , the majority of the players will take their medals back to homes in @entity19			1
@entity32 , who had been two seasons with @entity35 before helping his nation triumph in @entity37 , was the first @entity2 world champion not to be based in his own country			2
at this tournament , it would be easier to list those that remain			2
even @entity43 have only three players in their @entity45 , and four who play in @entity10			1
@entity8 ’s squad contains five players who did not even play what would amount to a full season in their domestic league before departing - including @entity52 , whose career at home amounts to one game for @entity57 in 2004			1
so when @entity59 and @entity60 meet tonight in the @entity61 in @entity62 , it should be with no inferiority complex about what lies ahead			1
@entity19 will be guaranteed at least one representative in the semi-finals , perhaps as many as three			2
indeed , the most eye - catching , emphatic performances of the competition so far - @entity68 1 @entity72 5 , @entity60 4 @entity73 0 , @entity59 5 @entity30 2 - have come from the @entity6 , even if the outstanding individuals - @entity75 , @entity24 , @entity76 , @entity77 - have been @entity2			1
high five ! @entity72 's emphatic victory over @entity68 was one of the outstanding matches of the @entity27 so far @entity82 : @entity83 highlights progressed : @entity85 scores against @entity86 to see @entity21 make it through to the quarter - finals icon : @entity32 was the only member of the 1978 @entity10 @entity27 squad not to play in his homeland times have changed			1
a trip to the southern hemisphere is no longer so daunting for players who travel in the @entity96 on an almost weekly basis and regularly undertake pre-season or mid-season trips to distant continents			0
in 1930 , when the first @entity27 was held in @entity101 , the four @entity6 participants , @entity21 , @entity59 , @entity103 and @entity104 , all left on the same ship , along with the three @entity6 referees , @entity109 president @entity108 and what was to become his trophy			1
the hosts won , but it was n’t a complete disaster for the @entity6 visitors			1
@entity104 beat @entity8 and @entity116 , @entity103 defeated @entity117 and @entity59 got the better of @entity118			1
only @entity21 did not record a victory over a continental rival			2
in 1950 , when the @entity27 came to @entity8 the last time , the prospect of travelling across the @entity122 was still so alien that @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity73 and @entity59 qualified but chose not to compete			1
the group stage record of the @entity6 clubs against @entity2 and @entity128 opponents , then , is very creditable : they lost only two of 10 games , and won six			1
nothing to fear : @entity59 have impressed at this summer 's tournament having breezed through the group stage team effort : @entity60 have been seen one of the tournament 's favourites since before it started @entity82 : @entity60 highlights in 1962 , in @entity140 , six of the eight quarter - finalists were @entity6 , even if @entity8 defeated @entity141 in the final			1
so the idea that it is impossible for a @entity6 country to win on @entity2 soil , while evidence - based to here , is not unreasonably challenged			1
certainly , the @entity149 , who have not failed to make it beyond the @entity27 ’s group stage since 1938 , looked very at home at their @entity62 hotel base on thursday			2
a viral illness had affected a number of the squad , but those who were fit and able happily bathed in the sun by the swimming pool , signing autographs , posing for photographs and looking very relaxed			0
@entity161 went for a walk along the beachfront alone and returned surrounded by an excited mob			0
there were screams and squeals from supporters kept behind barriers every time a player made an appearance on his balcony			0
the player waved , the fans squealed some more , and some held up perfectly inscribed pieces of card , explaining why they needed a t - shirt signed			2
very ordered autograph hunters , the @entity149			0
none of this chasing @entity181 down the road shouting , ‘ @entity180 ’			0
they would have an @entity185 replica shirt , with his name on the back , plus a legible , formal , written request clearly displayed and a black marker pen ready			0
it was almost as if , instinctively , they knew the drill			0
being @entity149 , they probably did			0
settled : @entity60 have made themselves at home at their @entity62 base this summer considering the envy for this @entity149 team in @entity202 , there is a surprising swirl of dissent around @entity205 and his selections			1
there is criticism of his back four , which amounts to a quartet of centre - halves , and fury that this means he now plays @entity215 in midfield , echoing his new role under @entity218 at @entity219			2
further negative @entity221 influence is seen in @entity205 ’s preference for a false nine , with the squad ’s only striker , @entity223 , on the bench			0
fine when putting four past @entity73 , less so when taken to extra time by @entity227			0
certainly , @entity215 will have his work cut out on friday night , up against arguably the most powerful central midfielder in the competition , @entity231 of @entity59			1
comparisons with @entity233 now seem very apposite , although in time the @entity185 man thinks they will come to flatter him			0
he feels @entity231 is more capable of changing games going forward , and is probably right			0
even so , @entity60 remain narrow favourites			1
‘ we have big ambitions , more than ever now we are in the last eight , ’ said @entity238 ’s @entity237			0
‘ when you come to a @entity27 with @entity60 , you are expected to win it			1
’ @entity181 was in agreement			0
‘ we would be legends as the first @entity6 team to win in @entity2 , ’ he added			1
' we can beat anyone on our day			0
’ @entity247 man : @entity59 midfielder @entity231 has been compared to compatriot @entity233 @entity82 : @entity59 highlights iit will be hot at the @entity61 , 30 degrees , but there was a heatwave in @entity60 in the 2006 @entity27 , too			1
certainly the climate has n’t been the killer of @entity6 ambitions that many suspected			2
@entity255 was difficult , but when @entity202 played @entity101 in @entity257 , for instance , the temperature was more conducive to a @entity6 team than a @entity2 one			1
@entity60 think the debilitating bug may have been caused by a sudden drop in temperature in miserable @entity264 , having got used to the sunshine of @entity266			2
given the vast travelling distances involved , jetlag seems more of an issue than sunstroke right now			0
how great a part will be played by continental allegiance , though , remains to be seen			0
does the fact that @entity8 and @entity10 have almost as many players who are based in @entity19 - 18 and 19 respectively - as either @entity60 , @entity59 , @entity72 or @entity21 mean @entity2 ’s advantage on their own continent is at an end ? the locals even have a name for the @entity280 who play abroad - estrangeiros , they call them			1
of the four still based in @entity8 , two are the reserve goalkeepers , @entity284 and @entity285			2
the first - choice goalkeeper , @entity286 , now plays for @entity287			0
strangers : brazilians who play in @entity19 , like goalkeeper @entity286 , are called foreigners by fans maybe that is why the @entity280 national anthem is sung with such passion and conviction by the team , some with tears running down their cheeks			1
exiles are often the ones who most crave emotional connection with the homeland			0
low , @entity60 ’s coach , even believes this is a potent force that makes the @entity2 harder to beat			1
‘ they are all at home here , but it is not just about that , ’ he said			0
‘ the @entity2 , even the @entity128 , want to show their class on their home continent			2
they want to show the world “ this is where we come from ”			0
they will do whatever is necessary to satisfy the fans and the nation			0
they are strong teams anyway , so with that , it is no surprise to me that they play well			2
you can feel that emotion			0
’ for a while , though , the @entity61 will echo to old world rivalries tomorrow , but estrangeiros await the winner in the semi-final			0
that will decide what matters in @entity8 : where you ’re from , or where you ’re at .			2

the four @entity1 held in @entity2 have all been won by a @entity2 team
@entity10 and hosts @entity8 are favourites to win this summer 's tournament
@entity343 play club *football* in @entity19
@entity60 , @entity59 , @entity72 and @entity21 are the four @entity6 representatives in the quarter - finals
@entity43 and @entity349 make up the eight teams left in the competition
