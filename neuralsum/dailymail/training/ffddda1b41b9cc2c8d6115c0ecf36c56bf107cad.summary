by @entity0 from a distance it may look like a @entity3 is preparing to land			0
but rather than being a scene from a @entity7 sci - fi film , these images capture the moment thousands of starlings flocked together into the shape of a spaceship			1
nature photographer @entity11 caught the extraordinary spectacle , as he watched the birds swarm to seek the warmth of nearby cattle sheds			1
swarming to seek shelter in a nearby cattle shed , thousands of starlings gathered together in the skies over @entity20 near @entity21 in @entity22 , to form the shape of a spaceship nature photographer @entity11 travelled to @entity22 with the hope of capturing the phenomena			1
he watched as the birds soared above his head creating stunning images in the winter sky at dusk as they soared above the 44 - year - old 's head , they created an array of shapes in the winter sky at dusk in the skies over @entity20 , near @entity21 in @entity22			1
mr @entity11 travelled 110 miles from his home in the @entity40 , @entity41 , to photograph the phenomenon of the starlings flocking together			1
the persistent snapper waited for nearly two hours until the first of the birds appeared			2
he said : ' at first there were just small groups of starlings in the fields , before they started to come in squadrons of 40 or 50 , flying all over			0
' then suddenly , before i knew it , there were thousands all amalgamating together and they had formed the shape of a @entity3			2
' it was spectacular to watch			0
' the images show the birds taking flight , filling the sky as though it was thick with smoke during the last few hours of sunlight			1
another shot reveals the swarm of birds gliding together to mimic the shape of a dolphin			1
this image shows the birds flocking together forming the shape of a dolphin with some leading , depicting the nose while thousands in pursuit gather to create the body , fin and tail mr @entity11 said : ' starlings have a bit of a bad reputation			1
people see them in their gardens and think they are raucous and ugly , or that they bully other birds			2
but when you see them like that , it 's one of nature 's greatest spectacles ' some fly ahead to form the head and nose , while those in pursuit funnel together to capture the shape of the mammal 's fin and tail			1
but mr @entity11 said he had just minutes to secure the stunning shots , before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon and the starlings fled , seeking shelter for the night			2
he said : ' i 'd been waiting for a couple of hours before they arrived , and i was starting to think i was n't going to have any luck			0
' i was aware it was getting darker and when it started to rain i thought : " well , that 's the end of that , then "			2
' luckily it was only a shower though , and the birds turned up at around 4pm			0
' but after about 10 minutes , as quickly as they arrive , they are gone			0
' you have be to there at exactly the right time - if i 'd got there at 4.15pm , i 'd have missed it all			0
mr @entity120 added : ' i have never seen anything as big as that			0
' it must be one of the biggest flocks in the country			0
' starlings have a bit of a bad reputation , though			0
' people see them in their gardens and think they are raucous and ugly , or that they bully other birds			0
' but when you see them like that , it 's one of nature 's greatest spectacles			1
