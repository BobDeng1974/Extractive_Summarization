it was an ordinary hunting day in @entity1 earlier this month until two friends spotted a wild hog weighing nearly 800 pounds			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were on a ranch in @entity7 , owned by @entity9 commissioner @entity8 , when they discovered the large hog and embarked on a mission along with two hunting bulldogs to catch the wild beast			1
the hog nicknamed ' @entity16 ' is currently receiving around the clock care until its fate is decided			1
@entity4 started off his day alone but when he saw signs of the giant swine he called his friend @entity21 who was in a neighboring town and asked him for his help			1
big catch : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 ( right ) pose with the 790 pound hog they caught in @entity1 ' i did a double take			1
i could n’t believe his size , and he took off running down a draw			0
i tried to walk up and get a better look but he kept running off as i approached , ' @entity4 told @entity32			0
@entity4 is a long time hog hunter but up until january 16 , the largest hog he ever caught was 450 pounds , a little more than half the size of the 790 pound hog			1
' i got on the phone and called my friend @entity5 , who was in @entity37 , and told him what i had found , ‘ @entity4 said			1
' once he arrived on location we began to work a 20 - acre area with two catch dogs			0
' @entity4 started looking for the pig in a ravine and @entity5 sniffed around another part of the property			1
as @entity4 got further down into the ravine he noticed the pig made mud wallows the size of bathtubs			1
@entity4 and his dog immediately sensed the distinct smell of wild boar hog			2
' my dog started whining and wanted to be let loose , ' @entity4 said			0
all tied up : the hog was not killed , rather the hunters tied it up so that it could not move and transported it to cattle coral where it is currently being cared for around the clock the muscle : @entity5 held dog the hog as @entity4 ran to his truck to drive it closer to the hunting area so they could get the materials needed to hold the massive creature ' there was the distinct smell of wild boar hog and you could smell it even more as we began to work up a brushy hill			1
when i had almost topped it i could see him moving toward us and around , so we got by a big oak tree and kind of hid behind it			0
' @entity4 and his dog hid behind the tree until the animal was 10 yards away			0
@entity4 let his dog loose and he attempted to get the hog on the ear but the hog was so large that the dog was only to grasp onto its jaw			2
the dog continued to bite at the gargantuan pig who squealed as he tried to escape the dog 's pointy teeth			0
' the pig was really squealing and running around in circles and i ’m hollering for @entity21 to come running , and he ’s probably about 400 yards away , ' the hunter added			2
' the hog is trying to get down the hill and rake off my dog , but @entity21 and his dog got there just in time			2
' personal record : up until january 16 the biggest hog that @entity4 ever captured was only 450 pounds @entity21 heard his friends excited cries and rushed to his location			1
the hog was so large , @entity21 said the dog looked like the dog was a piece of jewelry hanging from the big pig			1
' when i first saw him , @entity116 ’s dog looked like an earring or some kind of jewelry hanging off the hog ’s head , but it really was n’t until we got ahold of the hog that i realized how big and powerful this animal was , ' @entity5 said			2
' we ’ve tied hundreds of hogs and there has never been anything like this boar			0
' the hog was so massive the men struggled to grab one of its legs and they were eventually able to flip it onto its side			0
@entity5 held dog the hog as @entity4 ran to his truck to drive it closer to the hunting area			1
they used ratchet straps to tie and bind the hog until it could n’t struggle any more			0
' he was incredibly strong ; we had three legs tied together and he still tried to stand up , ' @entity4 said			0
' together , @entity21 and i probably weigh a little over 430 pounds ; it was like we weighed nothing			0
' the men were so tired from capturing the hog they thought they might become ill. the prize : once the hunters got the hog tied , they called upon hunter @entity157 and @entity158 and a 2500 - pound winch to hoist the hog onto a trailer ' we were so tired i thought we were going to puke , ' @entity4 laughed			2
' there was no way we were going to be able to get him onto a trailer by ourselves – we were so tired			0
' once the men got the hog tied , they called upon hunter @entity157 and @entity158 and a 2500 - pound winch to hoist the hog onto a trailer			0
they then shipped the hog to a temporary home called cattle coral			1
@entity4 and @entity5 are n’t sure of the future of the hog but for the time being it is receiving 24 - hour care			1
' we may end up doing that ( selling the hog ) in the future , but for right now , we ’re undecided on what we ’re going to do , ' he said			0
' it ’s something that maybe we ’re going to think on for a little bit			0
' @entity4 said that he and @entity21 hunt as both a hobby and a business			0
they recently started a business called @entity191 to control the large amount of feral hogs in @entity1			2
over 2.6 million hogs roam around @entity1 and can damage crops and fields			1
the damage is so bad that @entity198 and the @entity200 @entity199 has looked into using bacon preservative to poison feral hogs and started a yearly ' @entity202 ' in october that puts no limits on hog hunting .			2
