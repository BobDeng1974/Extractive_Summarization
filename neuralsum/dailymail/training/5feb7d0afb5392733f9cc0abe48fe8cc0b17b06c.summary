the @entity0 believes @entity1 may have been recruited by the @entity2 as long as seven years ago and could have passed on a ‘ treasure trove ’ of secrets			1
the @entity6 intelligence agency is investigating whether the fugitive , now living in @entity8 , betrayed his country by working for the @entity11 regime as a double agent as early as 2007			1
@entity13 , a former senior @entity0 official , told the @entity14 that the fact @entity1 had ended up in @entity2 was a likely sign that @entity8 had signed him up when he was working for the spy agency in @entity18			1
security chiefs in the @entity36 are furious at the @entity1 leaks and say incalculable damage has been done by them			1
however , they do not share the belief that @entity1 was recruited by the @entity2 while working for the @entity0 in @entity18			1
and in an interview yesterday , @entity1 denied he had any relationship with the @entity2 government , claiming he had the best interests of the @entity21 public at heart when he leaked secret files to the media			1
the fugitive caused outrage last year by releasing thousands of @entity23 documents to the @entity51 and the @entity52			1
they detailed the @entity23 ’s practice of harvesting data on millions of telephone calls made in the @entity6 and around the world , and revealed the agency had snooped on foreign leaders			2
he fled the @entity6 last may and has been living under temporary asylum in @entity2 ever since			2
mr @entity13 said he had been told by contacts at the @entity0 that they were carrying out a ‘ damage assessment ’ into whether @entity1 handed sensitive information to the @entity2			1
‘ they are looking at the possibility that information was passed on , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a damage assessment – clearly what he saw in @entity18 has to be looked at and it has to be assumed that he passed it on to @entity2			1
’ disillusioned : @entity1 claims he was motivated to act after managers failed to listen when he raised concerns about the @entity23 's surveillance homesick : @entity1 says he would like to return to the @entity6 and does n't believe he deserves to be jailed from 2007 to 2009 , @entity1 was posted to @entity18 , where he worked as a ‘ communicator ’ , looking through intelligence reports and passing them on to headquarters in @entity80 , @entity81			1
he was so trusted during this time that he was chosen to provide president @entity83 with support at the 2008 @entity86 summit in @entity87			0
but mr @entity13 said he could have ‘ betrayed ’ his country by passing information to @entity8			1
‘ you ’d be seeing the intelligence briefings that @entity18 would get			2
you ’d also be getting @entity23 reports			2
that ’s the sort of regular stuff he ’d be getting across his desk			0
‘ he was a disaster there			0
as a communicator he will have seen everything			0
’ @entity1 could also have seen information sent by @entity36 intelligence , mr @entity13 said			1
‘ there ’s a daily intelligence briefing which gives you a summary of chatter and intercepts and diplomatic communication			0
he could have easily given it to @entity2			2
i think it is just horrendous			0
’ @entity13 says @entity1 's actions have hugely damaged @entity6 and @entity36 intelligence gathering @entity1 fled to @entity2 after a brief spell in @entity112 during which he was expected to seek asylum in a @entity21 state			1
but mr @entity13 said he suspected the stopover in the @entity116 had been part of a deliberate ploy to muddy the waters			2
‘ why did he not get a plane to @entity21 in the first place ? none of it stands up			0
it looks like a recruitment operation			0
’ speaking earlier on @entity126 , mr @entity13 said he believed @entity1 should go to jail for a long time , because letting such a high - profile whistleblower go free would set a dangerous precedent			1
‘ if you take that attitude with any whistleblower you ’d have a really bad problem , ’ he said			0
‘ could it lead to another catastrophe ? i ’d say yes			0
‘ that ’s a treasure trove that the @entity2 could use for years and years			2
they ’re going to know all the parameters about our intercepts and @entity140 ’s as well			0
’ denial : the @entity8 - based @entity23 whistlebower says he is not working with the @entity2 government back in the limelight : @entity23 whistleblower @entity1 appeared in his first interview with mainstream @entity147 on wednesday night mr @entity13 also derided @entity1 ’s claims in an @entity26 interview that he was a bona fide spy as ‘ silly ’			1
‘ i think we all know by now he was a systems administrator , ’ he said			0
‘ when he worked in @entity18 , he was a communicator – that means he sits in an office and relays messages back to @entity80			2
that ’s not a spy			0
‘ and secondly the @entity23 does n’t have spies overseas			0
it ’s got technicians who sit in @entity21 embassies and sort of listen to scanners			0
so i worry about his common sense here			0
he has a @entity163 complex it seems to me			0
’ mr @entity13 said @entity1 ’s actions would cost @entity166 intelligence agencies billions of dollars as they are forced to rebuild their communications systems			1
exclusive : the hour long interview on wednesday night was filmed in a @entity8 hotel secret service : @entity1 told @entity26 's @entity25 he had been trained as a spy and had worked undercover for the @entity0 and the @entity23			1

@entity1 said he was acting for the good of the country
the *30* - year - old does n't believe he should be given a *lengthy* *prison* term
former @entity23 worker denied having links to @entity2
he says @entity184 is *responsible* for his exile in @entity8
@entity13 , a former @entity0 officer , claims @entity2 were in touch with @entity1 in 2007 when he was stationed in @entity18
described @entity1 as a ' @entity163 ' character for claiming he was a spy but also said his leaks would cause damage to intelligence gathering
