published : 20:40 est , 27 february 2014 @entity1 : 20:40 est , 27 february 2014 it really may be a case of in one ear and out the other			0
research shows we have a poor memory for sound			0
as a result , we find it easier to remember things we see or touch than those we hear			1
the researchers recommend that we write down things we want to remember – and supplement the words with pictures			1
scientists at the @entity18 found that teachers should use more visual aids if they want pupils to remember what they are telling them as we find it easier to remember things we see , rather than hear to make the finding , @entity26 scientists asked a group of students to listen to pairs of beeps and say if the two were identical			1
the time lag between the beeps in each pair was gradually increased and the accuracy of their answers noted			1
visual memory was measured by doing the task with pictures and to test memory for touch , the students repeatedly a gripped a bar that vibrated at different rates			1
in the very short - term , all three types of memory were equally good			0
but within just four to eight seconds , the students clearly found it harder to remember the beeps than the pictures or vibrations			1
the finding could help explain why it is so hard to remember a phone number if you do n’t write it down			1
the finding could help explain why it is so hard to remember a phone number if you don ¿ t write it down researcher @entity65 , of the @entity18 , said : ‘ if someone gives you a number , and you dial it right away , you are usually fine			1
but do anything in between , and the odds are you will have forgotten it			0
’ dr @entity65 then did a second experiment using scenarios more akin to everyday life			0
students listened to recordings of dogs barking , watched silent videos of a basketball game , and picked up coffee mugs and other common objects hidden from view			2
the students remembered the videos and mugs and objects equally well			2
however , they recordings were more of a struggle			0
writing in the journal @entity90 , dr @entity65 said the results suggest that the way the mind processes and stores sound may be different from the way it process and stores other types of memories			2
she said : ‘ we tend to think that the parts of our brain wired for memory are integrated			0
‘ but our findings indicate our brain may use separate pathways to process information			0
‘ even more , our study suggests the brain may process auditory information differently than visual and tactile information , and alternative strategies - such as increased mental repetition - may be needed when trying to improve memory			0
‘ as teachers , we want to assume students will remember everything we say			1
but if you really want something to be memorable you may need to include a visual or hands - on experience , in addition to auditory information			0
’ with previous work showing that monkeys and chimps also find it harder to recall things they have heard , it is thought the weakness has its roots in the evolution of the primate brain .			2

students were made to listen to beeps to test their memories
within just four to eight seconds they found it difficult to remember
