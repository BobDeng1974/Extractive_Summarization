@entity2 chief @entity1 ’s reward for delivering another astonishing tv rights deal for the clubs could be the executive chairmanship			1
a decision on that role is expected before the next @entity2 meeting in march			1
and the timing could n’t be better for @entity1 , with the clubs wanting to show their gratitude for £ 5billion coming their way from domestic deals alone			1
@entity1 ’s promotion is said to have the support of up to 10 clubs already			2
and the @entity2 ’s nomination panel led by @entity20 chairman @entity19 , who had been expected to recommend the in - house option at the pre-christmas clubs ’ meeting , have not been in a hurry to appoint anyone else			1
@entity2 chief @entity1 has helped deliver a record £ 5billion tv rights deal for 2016 - 19 @entity28 has been unable to fulfil the chairman ’s role since suffering a serious stroke last march			1
and it is not ideal for the interim chairman , @entity34 lawyer @entity33 , to stay at the helm much longer when the @entity2 are his prime clients			1
if @entity1 does become chairman , the @entity2 are expected to appoint a robust independent director — not before time — to ensure @entity39 does n’t get everything his own way			1
@entity42 , who presents the @entity45 ’s @entity44 rugby coverage , is in pole position to do the same job for @entity48 during the @entity49			2
@entity50 is better known for his @entity45 work , but also hosts @entity53 tennis on @entity48 and looks to have recovered his reputation since the furore around his observation on 5 live that 2013 @entity59 champion @entity58 was ‘ never going to be a looker ’			2
@entity42 ( centre ) is currently presenting the @entity45 's coverage of the @entity44 rugby there has been the utmost secrecy around the @entity2 tv rights tender from the start , with confidentiality contracts signed by all involved			1
but with @entity74 and @entity75 splitting the rights , how much easier - and vastly cheaper - it might have been if the tv network @entity77 , @entity69 and @entity70 , whose children attend the same school in @entity73 , had agreed a price between them on the school run			1
the mystery over manager @entity83 ’s sacking and reinstatement by @entity85 might be a lot more straightforward than reported			2
perhaps the @entity88 owner was intent on dismissing @entity83 until he realised it would have left nobody qualified to take charge for tuesday night ’s defeat at @entity93			0
@entity85 owner @entity94 shakes hands with manager @entity83 at the @entity96 the @entity98 ’s flawed anti-discrimination policy , that saw referee grandee @entity100 only rapped over the knuckles for a racist comment and manager @entity83 expected to escape punishment despite an exchange of racist and sexist texts , is also evident at grassroots level			0
@entity107 were only fined £ 45 by the @entity98 after numerous complaints that the mother of one of their players had yelled ‘ shut up you monkey ’ at a mixed race youngster from @entity114			2
the mother escaped censure after her son moved to another club			0
@entity114 youth manager @entity121 said : ‘ it ’s scandalous a parent can get away with making such an appalling racist comment which shocked all who heard it			0
’ the mother insisted she had called the player a ‘ cheeky little monkey ’			0
the @entity98 say spectators at parks are outside their jurisdiction			0
former @entity133 captain @entity132 at an initiative with children 's charity @entity135 in @entity137 on monday there could be light at the end of the tunnel in @entity132 ’s long search for a home for his @entity145 @entity144 franchise			0
@entity132 ’s two waterfront proposals have been strongly resisted but the @entity148 commissioner is now backing building a stadium next to the @entity151 baseball venue			0
it is on the site of the former @entity154 and could utilise @entity151 car parking spaces			0
the @entity132 build will be privately funded , as there is still plenty of resentment in @entity145 about the amount of taxpayers ’ money spent on the @entity151 stadium			0
with everything involving @entity165 under great scrutiny ahead of the @entity168 presidential election in may , his nephew @entity176 selling sports marketing company @entity170 to the @entity175 for € 1bn will be closely analysed - especially as @entity170 benefit from being @entity168 ’s broadcast rights agents in 26 @entity173 territories for the 2018 and 2022 @entity174 .			1

@entity74 *dominate* £ *5bn* @entity2 tv rights deal for 2016 - 19
£ *5.136bn* deal means each @entity2 broadcast will cost £ 10.2m
the total figure is a rise of more than 70 per cent on the 2013 - 16 price
