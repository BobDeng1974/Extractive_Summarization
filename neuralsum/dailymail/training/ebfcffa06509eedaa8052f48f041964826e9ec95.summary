a super-camera capable of catching up to 50 times as many drivers as conventional speed cameras has been unveiled by councils across @entity5 as the latest weapon against motorists who break the rules of the road			1
some critics are already arguing the new system - known as @entity12 - will simply use motorists as ' cash cows ' , while fining drivers for every contravention to boost council income would be ' immoral '			1
the cameras , which each cost £ 17,000 and feature two lenses and night vision , are being snapped up by councils across the country in expectation of a law change allowing the use of cameras to fine drivers for a greater range of offences			1
goodbye @entity31 : conventional speed cameras , like the one pictured , are set to be replaced by " super-cameras " capable of catching 50 times more drivers in recent months , transport minister @entity36 said all councils should have the power to fine drivers for passing no - entry signs or making illegal u-turns and right turns			1
councils within @entity44 already have those powers under the 2004 @entity46 , but the government is now reviewing that situation for across the country			0
presently , cameras installed outside @entity44 are only used to enforce bus lanes			0
but the new cameras can also track drivers who wander into yellow box junctions or make prohibited turns			0
documents from @entity57 show that in trials on two similar stretches of road , the @entity12 system caught more than 1,000 offences in four weeks , compared to just 271 caught on conventional @entity64 cameras in an entire year			1
like borough councils across the capital , many others have expressed interest in the new system			1
@entity71 installed 15 @entity12 cameras last month , @entity70 is upgrading to @entity73 and both @entity74 and @entity75 in @entity76 already have the system in operation			1
watching : unlike the @entity64 ( pictured ) the @entity80 system can track more than just speeding offences , including drivers who make illegal u-turns or wander into bus lanes @entity86 of @entity87 , the company behind the @entity12 system , told @entity88 that the past year had seen ' a surge in interest from councils			1
' but motoring organisations have expressed their concerns			0
@entity94 from the @entity95 , said : ' sticking up cameras to enforce every minor contravention is bordering on the immoral			0
' @entity98 , @entity99 mp for @entity100 , also found himself at odds with the @entity12 system when he claims to have mistakenly pulled into a bus lane in @entity74			1
' they [ the council ] are using motorists as a cash cow			1
there is no other way of looking at it , ' he said			0
the widespread use of the cameras is also likely to further inflame recent criticism accusing councils of using parking fees as a massive moneyspinner			1
last month a survey revealed that town halls boosted their annual profit from parking tickets , permits and penalties in 2011 - 12 by more than £ 500million the @entity122 revealed councils raked in more than £ 1.4billion , of which nearly £ 565million was pure profit			1
that is £ 54million , 10.5 per cent , more than the ‘ surplus ’ in the previous year			2
in august , the @entity127 declared @entity128 in @entity44 had acted illegally in setting parking charges for the sole purpose of making profit			0
the @entity122 said councils must now ‘ come clean ’ about their parking charges and prove to motorists that they are not being used illegally to subsidise other services			2
mr @entity136 added that the figures showed ‘ why we need to review and rein in unfair town hall parking rules ’ and urged councils to stop treating drivers as a ‘ cash cow ’ to subsidise other services			2
caught on camera : the conventional @entity64 has been at the centre of controversy with motorists the @entity64 that made millions in 2009 , a motorway speed camera on the @entity148 at the junction with the @entity150 near @entity151 , @entity152 , was estimated to catch up to 500 drivers a day - and generated nearly £ 1million a year in fines for @entity155			1
the camera , jointly run by @entity155 , was placed where the road narrowed from three lanes to two and the speed limit dropped from 70mph to 50mph			0
but figures showed accidents rose by a quarter and casualties almost doubled after the @entity64 camera was installed			1
police said crashes happened because motorists slowed down ahead of the camera and then sped up once they were clear of it			2
a pretty penny for @entity171 in 2010 , two fixed cameras installed to slow cars to 40mph approaching roadworks brought in £ 54,000 in just 10 days			2
the cameras were installed to slow drivers on the @entity178 @entity177 in @entity171			0
no smiles for the camera in 2011 , more than 24,500 drivers were refunded nearly £ 1.5m in fines after it was found a speed camera had been operating illegally for 10 years			2
thousands were wrongly trapped by the @entity64 device positioned along the busy @entity187 at @entity188 , @entity189			2
when the camera was installed in 1997 , a clerical error on the original paperwork meant a road used to mark out the 30mph zone it policed , did not exist			0
the error , which meant the speed limit was invalid and so could not be enforced by the camera , came to light when a judge spotted it in documents relating to the case of a lorry driver			0
as a result 24,259 drivers who paid fines of £ 40 and £ 60 between 1997 and 2007 were refunded			0
some 201 motorists who challenged their fines in court received a total of £ 22,827 back from extra costs and fines they incurred			0
and those who incurred three penalty points on their driving licences had them the wiped off			0
the blunder has also cost the @entity218 organisation £ 370,981 in administration costs picked up for sorting out the mess .			0

the @entity12 cameras cost £ 17,000 each
in a two - week trial , new camera caught more than 1,000 offences - compared to just 271 in entire year with conventional @entity64
company behind super-camera claims ' surge in interest ' from councils
critics claim new system will simply use motorists as ' cash cows '
