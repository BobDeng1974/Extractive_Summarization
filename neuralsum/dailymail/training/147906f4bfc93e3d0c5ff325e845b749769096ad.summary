workers have been accused of wasting money after choosing to widen a footpath rather than cut back an overgrown hedge so people could get past			1
the path , which links a main road to pensioner bungalows in @entity9 , @entity10 , had become blocked due to a hedge running alongside it becoming overgrown			1
but it is claimed that workmen decided to widen the path so more people had space to pass the rampant overgrown hedge , rather than just prune back its leaves and branches			1
the 74 - year - old said : ' i could n't believe it when i saw that instead of cutting the bush back they 'd put more tarmac down			2
' it 's a complete waste of money			0
i reckon i could have cut the hedge back in half an hour			0
' how long does it take to dig out the grass , put hard core down and lay a path ? ' mr @entity22 also added that the new tarmac extension did not even solve the problem because workmen had only dealt with part of the path			1
mr @entity22 , left , said : ' it 's a complete waste of money			2
i reckon i could have cut the hedge back in half an hour he explained : ' they should come back and cut the hedge back all the way up the path or remove it			2
' mr @entity22 keeps fit by walking to nearby @entity52 , using the path , which runs up a hill towards four bungalows for the elderly			1
several years ago @entity56 replaced the steps on the incline with a ramp to provide wheelchair access to the bungalows			0
he said he had first reported the overgrown hedge a few years ago and that time workmen had cut it back			1
however , a spokesman for the council said they were n't responsible for the new path , adding it was nothing to do with them he added : ' the path was very wide , but this bush started growing and growing until it went over most of the path			2
' you have to walk on the grass verge to get round			0
i 'm fairly fit but i have to step on the grass			0
' i 've seen kids on their bikes come straight down from the path to the grass then back to the path , which is dangerous if they slip			0
' a council spokesman said the incident was nothing to do with the council .			0

the footpath near pensioner bungalows in @entity9 had become blocked
an overgrown hedge was preventing people from using the path
but instead of pruning the hedge , workers decided to widen the footpath
@entity22 says he could n't believe what he saw when workers started laying tarmac
but the local council says the new path is nothing to do with them
