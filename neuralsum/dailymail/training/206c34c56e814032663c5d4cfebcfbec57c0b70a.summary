by @entity0 and @entity1 debt - ridden : @entity2 racked up £ 20,000k on credit cards and overdrafts and owed money to loan sharks after racking up £ 20k in debt by the age of 22 , a desperate young woman felt giving up her life and living on the streets was her only option			1
so one day in 2002 , @entity2 caught the first coach she found leaving @entity14 and did n't look back			1
she left behind her grandmother , who had raised her in @entity14 after her mother walked out on her at the age of three			1
@entity2 's grandfather , father and grandmother were all involved at various stages of their life in criminal activity , forcing @entity2 to grow up fast and become responsible for paying the bills and mortgage legally			1
she got a job at a bank but the seemingly readily available money at her fingertips led to her spiraling into debt			1
‘ i was available to everything on offer – cards , loans , overdrafts – and because i worked in the bank and had such good credit , more and more of them just kept on coming through my door and were never questioned , ’ @entity2 said when she appeared on yesterday 's @entity39			1
' @entity44 does n’t just happen overnight			0
at first i was paying them all off but eventually , over time , the debts grew			2
' she showered her friends and family with presents and was oblivious to her outgoings			0
' i took @entity54 shopping and bought takeaways for the whole family and spent hundreds of pounds on groceries - i always wanted to see the cupboards full of food because they were n't when i was younger , ' she writes in a book of her experiences , called @entity63			1
' i wanted my family to have everything : my family who had known nothing but hardship , persecution and prosecution , who 'd had nothing before			0
now they could have everything and i 'd pay for it			0
i was trying to prove that i could be useful			0
' but three years of overspending led to £ 200,000 of debt			1
' by now i was using one credit card to pay off another , ' she writes			2
she added that once the credit cards and overdrafts were maxed out , she had to seek other means to fuel her spending , going to dangerous loan sharks			1
she sank into depression and shopping became her only release and escapism - adding further to her debt			2
guilt - ridden , she later confessed and lost her job , which caused her to sink deeper into depression			1
she even considered taking her own life			0
' i did n't want to be alive anymore , ' she confessed to @entity102 and @entity103 on this morning			2
it was then @entity2 decided to flee			1
she went to @entity106 coach station , asked for a ticket to ' anywhere , ' and ended up in @entity109			1
once there , @entity2 became a missing person			1
she was so ashamed by her debts and overcome with depression – she wanted to forget her identity altogether			0
' it 's easy to disappear initially , but you have to work to stay under the radar , ' she explained on this morning			0
' every part of society is trying to bring you back in			0
you have a @entity122 number			0
you have to become a non-person			0
' desperate : she did n't know where to turn when her debts spiralled and she ended up on the streets of @entity109 ( posed by model ) turned her life around : now she 's a proud mother and published author for several months , @entity2 spent time on the streets or in hostels , resorting to drastic measures to get by including conning men out of money by pretending to be interested in them			1
all this time , her grandmother had no idea what had become of her and @entity2 did n't get in touch			1
she moved from place to place making it impossible for her to be tracked down			0
in trying to explain how she could leave her grandmother without even a note to explain her absence , @entity2 says : ' i was so emotionally distraught and had gone through all the emotions you can think of before i left			1
by the time i did leave it was like i was numb			2
it was like the person before was dead			0
i could n't feel anything anymore			2
' @entity2 's memoir , @entity63 , published by @entity154 , recounts her time living on the streets and in shelters and the dangers she encountered			1
missing : @entity2 has written a book on her experiences she eventually changed her name by deed poll using legal aid and this enabled her to start signing on , open a bank account and get part - time work without fear of being discovered for who she really was			1
it was becoming a mother that finally made @entity2 realise she could n't keep running away from her old life			1
' i did n't want to live on the streets anymore , ' she says			1
' i wanted her to have a proper upbringing , ' she said of her daughter , @entity176 , who she fell pregnant with after a brief relationship with a man she met in a pub. @entity2 went to a doctor and asked for help			2
they promptly put her in for counselling and she was supported by the @entity184			0
eventually , she was ready to be reunited with her nan and her father and got back in touch with them			0
she now regrets running away from them for so long			2
she writes in her book : ' i need to say sorry to the people i walked away from			0
i can only imagine how they must have felt			0
' now age 34 and a proud mother settled in @entity109 , @entity2 now earns a living through book writing			1
she first helped her grandmother publish her story , @entity200 , and has now released her own memoir			0
she hopes sharing her story can help others			0
she advises people who get into debt to seek help and speak out rather than running away like she did			2
' always talk about what 's gong on inside you			0
do n't keep it to yourself			2
i know it 's hard and sometimes more difficult to talk to people you know than a stranger			0
but you are never alone , like i thought i was			0
' @entity2 's book , @entity63 , was published this week to coincide with @entity217 , www.missingpeople.org.uk			2

@entity2 spiralled into debt after working at a bank
she could n't control her spending
maxed out overdrafts and credit cards then resorted to loan sharks
she lost her job after stealing £ *1k*
depressed and £ 20k in debt , she thought running away was only option
left @entity14 for @entity109 where she spent time on streets
becoming a mother made her face reality
