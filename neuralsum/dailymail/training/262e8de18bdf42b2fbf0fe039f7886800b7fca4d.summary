by @entity0 for years scientists have debated whether an asteroid , climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs			0
now experts believe that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘ colossal bad luck ’			0
dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history , they said			1
dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction ( illu8strated ) if it had come slightly earlier or later in history			1
experts say that the creatures were killed by ' colossal bad luck ' as they were already weakened by a changing climate and did not have time to adapt but when the six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now @entity26 approximately 66 million years ago , dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval , which left them vulnerable			1
the new study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the @entity32 looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils , mostly from @entity35			0
they found that widespread volcanic activity , changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs ’ food chain when disaster struck			1
if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier , when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust , they may have survived , according to the study , which was published in the journal @entity50			1
when the six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid hit what is now @entity26 approximately 66 million years ago ( illustrated ) dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval such as changing temperatures and chains of volcanic activity , which left them vulnerable , according to the new study many scientists agree that a six - mile - wide ( 10km ) asteroid that struck what is now @entity26 66 million years ago , led to the dying of the majority of dinosaurs			1
the new study says that if it had struck a few million years earlier or later , prehistoric creatures such as the @entity66 may have survived			1
experts studied fossils to find that widespread volcanic activity , changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs ’ food chain when disaster struck			1
if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier , when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust , they may have survived			1
likewise , if it had come later in history when new species had been given the chance to evolve , they might have escaped extinction			2
but when the asteroid struck - causing tsunamis , earthquakes , wildfires , sudden temperature swings and other environmental changes - the already weakened dinosaur kingdom was wiped out one species after another			2

the only dinosaurs to survive were those that could fly , which evolved to become the birds of today			0
dr @entity104 , of the @entity32 ’s @entity105 , said : ‘ the dinosaurs were victims of colossal bad luck			0
‘ not only did a giant asteroid strike , but it happened at the worst possible time , when their ecosystems were vulnerable			0
‘ our new findings help clarify one of the enduring mysteries of science			0
’ dr @entity118 , from the @entity119 , said there was nothing to suggest that dinosaurs were doomed to extinction when the asteroid hit			0
‘ without that asteroid , the dinosaurs would probably still be here , and we very probably would not , ’ he added			0
it is hoped that that ongoing studies in @entity129 and @entity130 will aid even better understanding of what occurred .			0

a study led by the @entity32 says the dinosaurs may have survived if the asteroid struck several million years earlier or later
many experts agree that an asteroid strike that hit what is now @entity26 , caused the demise of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago
creatures were already suffering environmental upheaval - with wide spread volcanic activity and changing temperatures - which left them vulnerable
if the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier , when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust , they may have survived
if it had come later in history when new species had been given the chance to evolve , they might have escaped extinction , the experts said
