' the crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds			0
' @entity165 for @entity166 's dr @entity143 began investigating a low - frequency underwater sound signal @entity6 's civil aviation chief , @entity168 declared the crash an accident dr @entity143 said that the noise may have been due to a geological event , including a small earth tremor , but the timing piqued the interest of his research team			1
the crash was officially declared an accident by @entity6 civil aviation chief @entity168 earlier this year			2
