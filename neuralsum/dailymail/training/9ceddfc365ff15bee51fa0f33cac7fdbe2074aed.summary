@entity4 , 43 , started contacting the 16 - year - old boy on @entity6 shortly after he left @entity7 , in @entity8 , @entity9 , in july 2012			1
the pair then exchanged phone numbers and began sending personal text messages and pictures to each other , the @entity10 heard			1
mrs @entity16 was reported to the school after sending an image of herself ‘ bare - breasted ’ from the neck down in november 2012			1
she resigned from her post before a formal disciplinary hearing took place at the school			2
@entity4 , 43 , contacted former pupil of @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , where she was a teacher but mrs @entity16 , who had worked at the school since 2002 , has now been banned from teaching indefinitely after a @entity26 found her actions amounted to ‘ unacceptable professional conduct ’ and ‘ conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute ’			1
the teacher admitted failing to maintain professional boundaries with her former student , referred to as @entity34 in a statement to the @entity10 panel , she said : ‘ [ i would ] like to apologise for any upset and distress caused to the ex-pupil who i let down badly throughout the entire incident			0
‘ above all it is the impact on him that i am mindful on - as well as the impact on other pupils and the school community as a whole			0
’ @entity47 , chairing the @entity10 panel , said her actions were an ‘ abuse ’ of her ‘ position of trust ’			0
she said : ‘ although the actions occurred after @entity52 had left the school , they involved misconduct in the education setting because the relationship was initiated by mrs @entity16 in her capacity as @entity52 ’s teacher			1
‘ the fact that details of the @entity6 and text messages quickly became common knowledge serves to damage public perception of mrs @entity16 and the teaching profession			1
the @entity10 , where @entity4 received a five year ban from teaching ‘ teachers have a uniquely influential role and pupils and the public must be able to view teachers as role models in the way they behave			2

the @entity10 panel recommended to the secretary of state for education that mrs @entity16 should be barred from teaching for at least five years			0
the decision maker on behalf of @entity82 , @entity83 said : ‘ whilst not sexually motivated , mrs @entity16 ’s behaviour , and in particular her failure to maintain appropriate boundaries , falls well short of the standards expected and i agree that a prohibition order is a proportionate sanction			2
‘ mrs @entity16 has shown significant insight and genuine remorse			0
she has been honest about her behaviour both during the investigation of this case and also with her current employers			0
‘ i agree with the panel ’s recommendation that she should be allowed to apply to have the order set aside after a period of five years has elapsed			0
‘ this means that mrs @entity4 is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and can not teach in any school , sixth form college , relevant youth accommodation or children ’s home in @entity106			1
' she may apply for the @entity110 to be set aside , but not until 7 september 2019 , five years from the date of this order at the earliest			0
