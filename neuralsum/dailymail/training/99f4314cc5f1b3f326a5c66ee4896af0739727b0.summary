by @entity0 while tourists might be preoccupied with snapping @entity3 landmarks in @entity5 ’s capital city , beneath the streets geologists are documenting equally ancient tunnels			1
a labyrinth of subterranean passages that date back to the founding of @entity12 are being mapped to predict which modern buildings could be at risk of suddenly disappearing into a @entity17 quarry system			1
while this may seem unlikely , a staggering 83 structures have already collapsed due to the underground network of passages this year alone , ranging from buildings to streets			0
a labyrinth of passages ( pictured ) that date back to the founding of @entity12 are being mapped to predict which modern buildings are at risk of suddenly disappearing into a @entity3 quarry system a team of geologists from @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 , @entity35 di @entity34 , are exploring the underground network to produce a detailed map that can be used to assess areas of the city that are most at risk			1
geologist @entity41 from the university told @entity43 , that the mapping activity is critical as over the years locals have been patching up holes that have suddenly appeared			0
the geoscientists are using 3d laser scanning to look for weaknesses in known tunnels , before entering them through manholes to map the network , once they know they are safe			2
‘ there might be cracks , so they will be showing as veins almost , or openings , so we map the openings and map any kind of detachment , ’ she said			0
the team has come across weakened ceilings as well as blockages and collapses that are alarmingly close to street level			0
this map shows the expansion of @entity12 ( from its centre marked as 1 ) over the ancient quarry system , which is most comprehensive in the south east of the city , where dark green lines can be seen the geoscientists are using 3d laser scanning to look for weaknesses in known tunnels			1
any cracks show up as ' veins ' or openings on the scanning results			0
if a tunnel is found to be safe , the geologists enter it through manholes			2
they can then explore the tunnel and extend their map of the underground network			2
the tunnels were originally created to provide building material for the rapidly growing city			0
@entity12 is built on volcanic rock which is strong but easy to carve and was therefore of interest to @entity17 builders and architects , who also made use of less compacted volcanic material to produce mortar for their buildings			1
the first @entity17 dug into the rock outside the city but as @entity12 grew to fill the areas previously used as quarries , they knew they could still use the tunnels for rock , providing they kept them narrow so buildings above ground could still be supported , dr @entity41 explained			1
however , over time , weathering and humans have widened the tunnels – the latter by taking more rock from the tunnels for new buildings			0
here , people stand on a @entity3 street , which is over 15 ft ( 5m ) below modern street level and was built in the second century @entity117			0
dr @entity41 described underground ancient @entity12 as ' a double reality ' holes are opening up all over the city of @entity12 and weathering plus humans widening the tunnel - like quarries have been blamed			1
some locals have taken the repair of such holes into their own hands the tunnels have also been exploited for mushroom farming , ad - hoc sewer systems , catacombs and bomb shelters during @entity133 dr @entity41 said that quite a lot of ancient @entity12 that is now below street level that was not to start with and described the phenomenon as a ' double reality ’			2
‘ it 's interesting , because at times when you are down there , you can hear people on top , ’ she said			0
the team , whose work so far has been presented at the annual meeting of the @entity149 , began the study in the south eastern area of @entity12 , which has most quarries .			1

geologists from @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity155 in @entity12 are exploring the @entity3 network
starting in the south east of the city , they are producing a detailed map of the quarries that will be used to assess areas of @entity12 that are most at risk
the narrow tunnel - like quarries were dug by the @entity17 so they could use volcanic rock to build the city but the channels have since been widened
