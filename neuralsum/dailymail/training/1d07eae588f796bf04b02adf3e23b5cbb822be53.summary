i 've faced up to the facts this week and realised that i 'm in need of a total body detox			2
i have been partying far too much recently and iit has taken it 's toll on me , and in particular my waistline			2
the taut abs of my @entity8 cover ( nearly a year ago ) have disappeared under , dare i say it , a very slight paunch			2
well , enough is enough			2
i 'm not going back to the bad old days of yo - yo diet @entity11 so i 've booked into no 1 @entity13 for a dose of tough love , military style			1
the weigh in came as a shock on day one – 13 stone			1
this is ½ stone more than i weighed from my @entity8 challenge , and i 've lost a lot of muscle mass and gained fat			1
but at least i know that with some hard work and determination i can turn it round with a week or two at boot camp			2
taking the strain : @entity11 says that he has gained half a stone since his @entity8 cover shoot last year i work out : @entity11 lifts some weights and works up a sweat taking in the view : @entity11 goes for a jog on the scenic @entity20 beach the next morning everything starts with a bang			1
loud pumping dance music wakes you ( well it is @entity20 after all ) at 7am , and if the relentless thud of the bass does n't get you up the dulcet tones of former @entity61 ( @entity62 ) @entity63 will			1
@entity63 motivates all the campers with a special mix of discipline and peer group pressure			0
he 's clearly turned down the volume on what he would have handed out to wannabe fighter pilots in the @entity61 - his no 1 @entity13 style is much more about encouragement and getting the best out of people			0
and breathe : @entity11 looks worn out after an intensive work out taking the plunge : @entity11 cools off in the villa pool after a day of intense exercise out and about : @entity11 explores the island while out on a trek at 7.30am there is a fitness test in the grounds of the luxurious villa – which is running for 15 minutes , and then a test to see how many sit ups , push ups and burpees you can do			1
then back for breakfast which consists of eggs , mushrooms and spinach – absolutely no toast , bagels or cereals			1
the food is wheat - free , gluten - free , sugar - free and unprocessed			0
keeping focus : @entity11 says that too much partying has lead him to gain weight and he is prepared to concentrate on his fitness from now on working up a sweat : @entity11 pushes himself to the limit during an exercising session mind , body , soul : @entity11 wants to stays in tune with his body at 9.30 we move on to an hour long beach run			1
it looks more effortless and fun in the photos than it is in real life			0
it 's harder to run on sand than it is on road , and your thighs soon feel the difference			0
there is a quick half hour break for some frozen watermelon and nutty energy balls and then it 's straight on to gruelling triathlon circuits and sea swimming			1
if that 's not enough , we then have to run back to the villa			1
lunch is quinoa and stuffed peppers and is tasty and provides a nutrient dense low - carb diet			0
they do n't starve you here , you are given enough to eat , around 1,200 calories a day , but you are probably burning at least 2,000 with the work - outs so you are going to lose weight			0
clean and lean : @entity11 's @entity20 diet is completely gluten - free , sugar - free and unprocessed after lunch it 's a weights session followed by all - over resistance circuits – by 3.30pm the most painful bits of the day are done , and then it 's down to some games around the pool , and the other campers were really friendly and up for a laugh			1
there was time for a bit of lounging by the pool and catching some rays			0
the weather is still sunny and warm , even though it 's not summer any more , and the location and scenery are breathtakingly beautiful			0
making mates : @entity11 gushes over a dog during a break from exercising chilling : @entity11 takes a well - earned break on a sun lounger after a hard day 's work dinner at 6pm was a delicious @entity170 baked salmon with mango and avocado salsa and then we settled down for movie night and bed by 9.30pm			1
yes , i know that does n't sound like me but if you do n't get a good night 's sleep your body simply wo n't cope the next day			0
i 've got another week of this to go – if i can stick it out - and then hopefully i will be ripped up and in top shape again			2
i 'll show you next week how i get on			0
all the best , @entity186			0

@entity188 is *spending* two weeks in @entity20
rather than living it up he will be taking on an intense fitness course
@entity11 is hoping to get back into shape after gaining half a stone
