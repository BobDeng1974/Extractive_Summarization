@entity0 knows @entity1 need to beat @entity2 this weekend if they are to maintain their push for @entity5 football			1
a summer of despair at @entity7 's has been followed by a quite remarkable season , leaving @entity1 sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining			1
last weekend 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity13 boosted their hopes of @entity5 qualification - a match in which @entity0 performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury			1
it was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the @entity23 international knows @entity1 have to follow it up with a win at home to @entity2 on saturday			1
@entity0 is keen for @entity1 to keep winning to maintain the push for @entity29 ' it was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again , ' @entity0 said			1
' with a bit of luck , a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point			2
' it 's important we do n't look too far in the future because it wo n't help			2
we can be happy with the point at @entity13 , but if we lose on saturday what does it mean ? ' we want to achieve something good , something special this season , so we have to win			1
that 's game by game			2
we ca n't play a different game on saturday , it 's @entity2			1
@entity51 challenges @entity52 for the ball during @entity1 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity13 ' we really want to achieve something very special for @entity1			1
we have nine games , nine finals ; we have very tough games left			2
' let 's get the three points with the supporters on saturday , that 's the first final			0
' @entity2 arrive at @entity7 's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend 's win against champions @entity65			1
@entity67 's men also got the better of @entity1 when they met earlier in the campaign and @entity0 is eyeing revenge			1
' it 's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood , they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence , ' he told @entity1 's official @entity76 channel			2
@entity0 is looking for revenge when @entity1 face @entity2 after they were beaten earlier in the season ' but at home , we need to win			1
we can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had , we have to do that , especially at home			0
' we have to be patient , show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter			0
' in the last game we deserved to win i think			0
we had the better chances and they had none really			0
' we had the throw - in and then they scored , it was very unlucky			0
we could have won there so we want to get a little revenge			0
' they have a lot of good players			0
when you 're not 100 per cent , anyone can beat you , that 's what people like about the @entity98			2
' we have to be 100 per cent			0
they are in a good mood so we have to be at our best			0
' i do n't think this group is over confident			0
we are focused and we know we have to show the quality on the ball			0
