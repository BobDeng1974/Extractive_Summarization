but in a statement released today , the presidential candidate said : ' let me be abundantly clear - my ability to function effectively has never been impeded by migraines and will not affect my ability to serve as commander in chief			2
' as a presidential candidate and office holder , i am focused on performing my job , which has never been more important given the state of our economy and the millions of @entity29 that are out of work			0
' while i appreciate the concern for me and my health , the greater concern should be the debate that is occurring in @entity50 over whether or not we will increase our debt , spending and taxes			0
' at a rally in @entity63 earlier , @entity104 investigative reporter @entity103 repeatedly asked her whether her migraines ever made her miss a @entity109 vote			1

' the migraines are so bad and so intense , she carries and takes all sorts of pills			1
pills after the migraine , to keep them under control			0
she has to take these pills wherever she goes			0
