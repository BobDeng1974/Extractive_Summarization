it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			1
what 's hot @entity5 @entity7 's scorer against @entity8 still gets a pound from his gran every time he finds the target			1
a left - back with two goals so far this season , he can expect a letter from the @entity16 soon			0
@entity5 opened the scoring for @entity7 in the @entity18 before @entity8 hit back at @entity19 @entity20 a woman who revels in her own ordinariness , @entity21 knits and once played a tree in a school play			1
she is , however , an extraordinary athlete and this week attempts to add the @entity28 skeleton gold to her @entity31 and recently acquired @entity30 titles			1
@entity34 in choosing their new @entity37 host , @entity35 have finally worked it out			2
quirky and offbeat works for midnight phone - ins and @entity31 breakfasts but prime time sport requires experience , subtlety and authority			2
there is , after all , a reason @entity48 was so successful			0
@entity49 ( right ) enjoyed a successful debut as he took over @entity35 's coverage of the @entity37 @entity52 there is something comfortingly familiar about the dull thud of the @entity58 full - back 's boot against a rugby ball			1
or is that just me ? whatever the case , @entity52 's place kicking is so good his percentage success rate in the mid- 80s places him in the company of @entity66 and the great @entity67			1
what 's not @entity69 there is no rulebook about how champions should behave but for the peculiar @entity74 there is a trusted creed located somewhere in @entity76 that could help			2
an @entity31 champion calling an @entity80 rival 's efforts on the track an ' embarrassment ' is rather , well , embarrassing			2
@entity69 and @entity82 hit out at each other during a @entity85 spat earlier this week the conversation quickly escalated as the two middle - distance runners aired their views on @entity85 sky cricket with the broadcaster now throwing even more of its money at football , something has to give			0
interesting , then , to see @entity95 anchoring @entity98 's excellent @entity97 coverage not from @entity99 but a cupboard in @entity101			0
' there 's a budget , ' said @entity95			0
football legends using the past to sell the present is fine but surely there are boundaries			0
@entity8 's latest official ' legend ' is @entity110 , the @entity111 striker who made 86 league appearances			1
for context , that 's 19 less than the human doughnut @entity116 who recently left @entity8 without fanfare			1
@entity119 the @entity111 club took pre-match banter to new levels ahead of tuesday 's game by posting a @entity85 mock - up of the @entity125 wearing a @entity119 scarf			0
a rather off - target gag , given that it applied to precisely 11.1 % of the squad picked by coach @entity130 .			0

@entity20 attempts to add @entity28 gold to @entity31 and @entity30 titles
@entity52 's kicking is up there with @entity66 and @entity67
@entity49 made a fine start to his @entity37 hosting role
@entity110 has been named a @entity8 ' legend ' despite making just 86 appearances , 19 fewer than @entity144 flop @entity116
