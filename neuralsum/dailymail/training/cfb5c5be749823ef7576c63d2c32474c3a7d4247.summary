by @entity0 there are rare times in football when goalkeepers pull off seemingly impossible saves – and @entity6 had to rely on one of those from @entity9 to knock @entity10 out of the @entity11			1
think @entity13 ' save from @entity15 's header in the 1970 @entity17 finals , @entity12 clawing out @entity19 's header when @entity20 played @entity21 in 1994 or @entity22 defying physics to keep out @entity25 's header that was behind him in @entity27 's 2003 @entity26 semi-final versus @entity29			0
@entity10 were only trailing 1 - 0 and deserved an equaliser but were left stunned when @entity6 's @entity9 leapt across goal to keep out and effort from @entity33 at point - blank range in the 65th minute			1
the ball struck his body and somehow went over			0
@entity38 's sting : @entity39 celebrates after scoring the wining goal in the @entity11 @entity10 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 - 56 ' ) , @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , @entity9 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 - 80 ' ) , @entity33 subs : @entity54 , @entity52 , day , @entity55 , @entity46 booked : @entity42 , @entity47 , @entity9 @entity6 : @entity9 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 - 29 ' ) , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( @entity63 - 84 ' ) , @entity39 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 - 81 ' ) subs : @entity69 , @entity59 , @entity67 , @entity63 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity55 booked : @entity72 scorer : @entity39 52 ' ref : @entity74 att : 3,989 at that moment they were ahead by one ruthless move			1
it had taken until the 52nd minute for the @entity79 side to take the lead against their @entity82 opponents			0
@entity83 picked up the ball in the right channel and played a deftly - weighted through ball to @entity66			0
the @entity87 dropped his shoulder to move one - on - one with goalkeeper @entity89 then selflessly passed to @entity39 to finish			1
it was his first goal for the club since moving from @entity92 this summer			0
the gulf in the two sides was evident when the team - sheets were handed out			0
@entity6 manager @entity96 was able to make nine changes from the side who beat @entity100 3 - 0 in their first game of the @entity79 season on saturday , whereas @entity10 's @entity103 could not even fill the allotted seven substitutes and named only five on his bench due to a raft of injuries			1
but until that punishing breakaway goal the difference in quality was not so clear cut and it was @entity10 , relegated from @entity112 last season , who almost took a shock lead in the 13th minute			1
striker @entity33 held up the ball on the right and laid off to @entity50 , whose effort across goal @entity117 but crashed back off the left post			1
it took several seconds to stop shaking			0
@entity6 's largely second string were inches away from going in front six minutes later			2
@entity58 played a long ball into the box and @entity89 failed to spot @entity39 's run , following the path of the ball instead			2
when @entity39 stretched out a leg to reach the ball it looked to be rolling towards an empty net , only to trickle agonisingly the wrong side of the right post			2
in the end , however , it was @entity9 's save that will be remembered from this tie			2
