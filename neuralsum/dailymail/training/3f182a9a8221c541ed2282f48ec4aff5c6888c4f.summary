extreme : @entity6 had not been punished by the school in the past for dyeing her hair blonde mrs @entity6 , a mother - of - five from @entity40 , in @entity26 , said : ' @entity6 has got dyed blonde hair , and last week i put a semi-permanent pink colour on the ends			1
' i did n't think it would be an issue but she went into her tutor in the morning and the head of year put her in isolation			1
' isolation would be an appropriate punishment for naughty children , not for something as minimal as this			0
' i was informed and went into the school to speak to the teachers but they said she would remain in isolation until the colour was gone , but it takes eight weeks to wash out			1
' so i took her out of school			0
i did n't know it was against the rules , i have never even seen or heard of the rules before			0
' @entity6 does n't get into trouble and she does well in school , but she was put into isolation in a corridor where everyone can see them and was n't allowed to socialise at breaks			2
' i thought it was a bit extreme and thought the school could have handled it differently , perhaps telling me to rectify it			0
' i would n't have done it if i knew it would cause trouble			0
' if it was all pink i could understand , but i did n't think a temporary colour would make a huge difference			0
' i think it 's bullying - they are saying their pupils ca n't have individuality			0
' @entity6 , a year eight pupil , went into @entity20 last thursday after dyeing her hair with the @entity35 hair dye 's ' hot hot pink ' shade although the dye would take up to eight weeks to fade , @entity18 has since stripped the pink colour from her daughter 's hair and she is due to return to school tomorrow			1
