@entity11 is accused of raping @entity7 , 30 , and grandmother @entity9 , 63 , in identical attacks two days apart on the island
both alleged victims insist @entity11 is not the man who *brutally* assaulted them on @entity6 in 2010
they claim authorities on the island were more *concerned* with *protecting* its reputation as a *tourist* *'s* paradise than *investigating* the *sex* attacks
the woman *decided* to waive their *automatic* right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large
