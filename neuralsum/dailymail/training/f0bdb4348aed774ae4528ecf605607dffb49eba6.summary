the 65 - year - old said : ‘ when i saw this massive bill , i thought there must be a mistake			1
' it turned out there were sometimes several calls a day and they could last more than two hours			1
‘ part of the problem is @entity24 do n’t post bills any more and they do n’t even email them			1

‘ i ’ve done that and i ’ve made lots of calls – although i did n’t think at first and @entity5 was still making calls when the complaint began , ’ he added			0
‘ in the end i told him to give me his sim card			0
i cut it up and told him i was n’t paying any more			0
‘ when we went into a shop shortly afterwards he bought me a bottle of @entity80 and asked if he did that every day for the rest of my life would it be enough			2
