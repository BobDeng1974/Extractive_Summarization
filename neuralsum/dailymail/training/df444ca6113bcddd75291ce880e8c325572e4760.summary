by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 16:41 est , 25 september 2013 you might imagine that having a ' royal ' kitchen would be an unaffordable dream			0
but eco-friendly prince @entity4 has prompted the design of a purse and planet - friendly kitchen ' for the people ' , that is specifically designed not to ' cost the earth			1
' the design of the new , lower - priced @entity13 range of cupboards came about after @entity4 , well known for his environmental campaigns , was impressed with the kitchen in the model home built by @entity18 for the @entity19			1
a kitchen fit for royalty : @entity18 have created eco-friendly kitchen designs the @entity4 was first impressed with the kitchen design in a model house at the @entity25 in 2011 @entity4 was shown around the two - story @entity26 at the @entity25 by television property expert @entity27 prince @entity4 , who toured the environmentally - friendly model home at the 2011 @entity25 , was apparently particularly impressed with the craftsmanship in the kitchen , @entity29 reports			1
his remarks led @entity18 to consider finding a way to bring the ' green ' designs to a mass market			1
the company set about designing a more affordable range of cupboards , which have now gone on sale online			2
the @entity13 cabinets are built in the same workshop in @entity43 as @entity18 's higher priced kitchens			2
but while @entity18 is a bespoke company offering a full design and fitting service , customers must collect and install the @entity13 cabinets themselves			2
' the @entity49 ' by @entity50 aims to bring high quality long lasting kitchens that are affordable the @entity13 cabinets are built in the same workshop in @entity43 as @entity18 's higher priced kitchens , but customers must collect and install the cabinets themselves worktops are available in three colours , iroko , oak , or sycamore wood , to give your kitchen an elegant royal makeover , and the range contains floor , tall and wall cabinets , which come in egg shell for you to paint the colour of your choice			1
an entire kitchen costs about £ 5,000 while an individual single floor cupboard costs £ 400			0
this might not seem particularly cheap , but the kitchen displayed in the original model home or ' @entity74 ' showcased at the @entity25 in 2011 would have cost around £ 35,000 to have installed			1
@entity75 , creative director of @entity18 and @entity13 says : ' we wanted to celebrate 20 years of @entity18 by taking a lead from @entity78 , prince @entity4 : going back to basics and making cupboards that ordinary people can afford - ' sensible cupboards at sensible prices '			1
' we are also paying tribute to the @entity86 craftsmen of the past whose honest , unfussy but eminently practical designs provided the original inspiration for @entity18 all those years ago			1
' inside , the house contained cushions made from old t - shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen , as well as vintage furniture it is a re-creation of the ' natural house ' , a new home design currently being pioneered by the educational charity at the @entity99 in @entity100			0
the house is a traditionally built low carbon home made from natural materials			0
inside the exhibition hall , @entity4 was shown around the two - storey @entity4 's @entity74 by television property experts and ambassadors for the charity @entity27 and @entity108			2
the @entity4 appeared particularly taken with the crockery featuring dogs , exclaiming ' i love that ' , and also the red dinner place mats made from old fire hoses inside , the house contained cushions made from old t - shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen , as well as vintage furniture			1
after their tour , ms @entity27 spoke about the @entity4 's interest in the project			0
she said : ' he 'd seen the blueprint			0
it was the first time he 'd seen it in @entity127 as it were , but was very aware of what was going on the whole way through and he 'd been to @entity100 to see the prototype of the house			0
what he particularly liked was all the different re-upholstered items and reuse of fabric			0
he was very impressed by the fact you could take something made for a different purpose and make it domestically useful			0
' she added : ' it 's what the @entity4 has been so passionate about for so long and yet it is at the moment enormously fashionable			0

@entity18 furniture *co.* created ' sensible cupboards at sensible prices '
