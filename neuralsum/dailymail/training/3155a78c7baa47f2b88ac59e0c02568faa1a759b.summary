by @entity0 published : 06:04 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 06:12 est , 7 october 2012 the families of murder victims could face compensation cuts under @entity4 plans to slash spending by £ 50million			1
unions and mps have blasted proposals to cut a quarter of the £ 200m awarded annually by the @entity9			1
the scheme awards compensation to more than 30,000 people each year who are seriously injured following violent crimes			0
loss : victims of crime could lose compensation under proposals to save £ 50m @entity18 , a union that represents retail workers , claims the cuts proposed by the government would mean almost 90 per cent of victims would see their compensation slashed or axed completely			1
the scheme was due to come into force on september 30 , but was withdrawn when it was condemned in committee by both @entity28 and @entity30 mps			2
however , the @entity31 is now re-considering the changes			1
@entity18 general secretary @entity33 said : ' we were very encouraged when the government withdrew the revised scheme , particularly in light of the comments made by conservative backbenchers , but unfortunately this now looks less like a rethink and more like a tactical retreat			0
' despite the government continuing to suggest otherwise , the current scheme is already on a sustainable financial footing and not even the most seriously affected victims would receive a penny more from the revised scheme			2
' on the contrary , half of victims would receive nothing in future and almost 90 per cent will lose out , including those most seriously injured and the children of murder victims			1
mp @entity56 ( left ) is one of a number of mps who have criticised plans to cut compensation for crime victims			1
the @entity62 says postal workers have a right to compensation if attacked by dogs ( right ) ' we now fear any amendments to the revised scheme will be purely cosmetic changes designed to help ministers avoid future political embarrassment , rather than assist the thousands of innocent victims of violent crime who rely on it as a last resort for financial recompense			1
' @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity28 mp @entity56 also slammed the planned cuts			0
mr @entity56 urged the government to ' think again ' , adding : ' i did not come into @entity83 to see these things cut			2
' the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) has added its voice to those objecting to the proposals			0
@entity62 @entity89 branch secretary and @entity91 president @entity88 criticised @entity4 plans to cut compensation claims for everything below £ 5000			1
he claims this would hit injured postal and telecom workers hard			2
he said : ' on average 12 postal workers are attacked every day by dogs			0
the attack is always dangerous but often the victims also suffer from symptoms of trauma that last long after the event itself			2
' ' this is yet another @entity4 attack on the most vulnerable members of our society			0
' however , the @entity31 , said criminals would shoulder more of the financial burden to make up the shortfall			1
a spokesperson said : ' we are putting more onus on criminals paying for victim support services , and expect to see around £ 50m more a year come from offenders as a result			0
the government continues to contribute £ 66m a year for victims services			0
' ministers have listened carefully to the concerns raised in @entity83 and are considering their next steps in light of this			0
' no decision has been taken			0
