@entity0 is right – the system of ending the @entity2 with play - offs to decide the title is all about money			1
the motive is surely beyond doubt			1
@entity9 ’ chief executive rattled cages at the start of the domestic season last weekend by arguing that a league should be settled in the traditional manner , with the club who finish on top of the table becoming champions			1
but it was his honesty in declaring that the status quo is ‘ only there for money reasons ’ that really resonated			2
there is no imminent prospect of the landscape being altered , but that does n’t diminish the validity of @entity0 ’ remarks			2
financial necessity drives the annual ritual of a 22 - game campaign hinging on what follows ; two semi-finals and a winner - takes - all final at @entity38			2
@entity40 team captain @entity39 ( right ) lifts the trophy after beating @entity9 last season @entity43 of @entity9 applauds the fans after defeat during last season 's @entity46 a league is decided in cup format , which means it ’s not really a league			1
that is not to knock the spectacle , which is often breath - taking , but after all these years it still does n’t seem quite right			2
no wonder , really , as 12 titles have been settled via the play - offs , but only four clubs in that time have claimed the trophy after claiming first place – @entity61 , @entity62 ( twice ) and @entity63			1
there is never any real fanfare of support for the play - off system among participants			1
by and large , when asked about it , coaches and players unite in the view that it is now established and the same rules apply to everyone , so there ca n’t be any complaints			0
it is accepted , but not cherished			0
yet , it is the standard model in professional rugby ; used to decide @entity81 ’s @entity80 , the @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity85 tussle for promotion to the @entity2 – where it is such a distorting factor that much of the regular season becomes incidental			0
@entity89 of @entity90 scores against the @entity91 at @entity38 last year the global calendar is too crowded , so removing play - offs would be wise in the bigger picture too			1
perhaps a successful @entity95 in these parts next year will generate such a surge in interest that a simple league format will suffice in generating precious profit			2
if there is a common desire to end the @entity104 season in style each year , how about this ? instead of play - offs , followed by @entity90 facing the @entity91 , perhaps the @entity2 champions can go to @entity38 the following week to take on the national team ( minus that club ’s contingent ) in a non-cap game			1
now that would be a club v country confrontation worth watching			0
when @entity95 tickets go on public sale on friday , there will be a stampede to watch the big games involving hosts @entity90 , @entity119 and other leading nations , especially @entity121			1
but much of the tournament ’s charm will be found in lower - key pool fixtures , when neutrals choose sides to support or attend in the hope of an upset			1
in @entity129 , @entity40 ’s @entity131 no 8 of @entity133 descent , @entity130 , will be unleashed in brutal combat with the @entity136 anagram of his name ( @entity140 ) @entity139			2
shock - seekers may fancy an afternoon at @entity143 when @entity144 face @entity145 , who are rising under the guidance of @entity148 and beat @entity119 last year			0
@entity150 ’s ground also hosts @entity152 v @entity151 – heaven for scrum purists and a chance to observe the @entity156 ’s giant @entity155 at close quarters			2
@entity159 , @entity158 will reverberate as @entity133 warriors attempt to find a way past @entity163 ’s immovable object – @entity164 of @entity9			2
games like these will not be overly corporate occasions so take advantage of fair prices , adopt a minnow , paint faces and embrace the colour and diversity of the event			0
@entity163 captain @entity164 in action against @entity176 at the @entity177 the home nations are running for the hills – literally – when the @entity95 countdown begins in earnest next summer			2
@entity90 go to @entity182 , @entity183 for a fortnight and @entity119 are off to find height and heat ; in @entity187 and @entity188			0
never mind the fitness benefits of training at altitude , these are wise moves by @entity193 and @entity194 for less scientific reasons			1
cabin fever is a major threat			0
while the tournament does n’t start until mid-september , squads will be together for the best part of 10 weeks prior to that point and no matter how luxurious the location , monotony becomes a big factor			0
test rugby is such a detailed , labour - intensive business now , but the pursuit of excellence can go too far			0
on the basis that a change is as good as a break , different scenery will help to maintain focus			0
down - time and the odd sociable outing are vital too , while briefly escaping the glare of pre-tournament hype is a sensible step			0
minds as well as bodies must be fit for purpose			0
the @entity221 in @entity182 , @entity183 , will host @entity90 's rugby squad next summer ahead of the @entity95 there is much consternation in @entity121 rugby circles about the imminent loss of a teenage prodigy known as ‘ @entity228 ’			1
@entity229 is a 21 - stone prop who grew up in @entity133 but is said to have supported @entity230 – which is where he is now heading , with reports @entity232 that the 18 - year - old is poised to sign for @entity234			1
@entity229 came to wider prominence in may when his power running and try - scoring exploits for @entity238 in @entity239 became a worldwide internet sensation			1
he was asked to sign a loyalty agreement with the @entity242 , but refused to do so and is now set to move across the @entity243			0
the @entity121 have often benefited from an influx of @entity246 talent , but this is a monstrous prospect from the islands who is on course to torment them in years to come , on behalf of the @entity230			1
@entity229 is a 21 - stone prop whose school videos have become an internet sensation last word – there was no doubt in the minds of @entity40 supporters at @entity259 last friday ; @entity150 hooker @entity260 dived to win a penalty			1
that was certainly the impression in real time and when the incident was replayed			0
the @entity267 collided with rival @entity39 , there was a fleeting pause then he crumpled to the turf			0
referee @entity271 was fooled but such theatrics are a creeping trend in the game which must be snuffed out			0
after last season ’s @entity277 , @entity176 wing @entity275 chose to apologise for an exaggerated fall which @entity9 captain @entity43 denounced at the time as ‘ embarrassing ’			2
@entity275 duly noted that ‘ sportsmanship and integrity ’ are central pillars of rugby ’s appeal , but they will soon collapse if mass , football - style deceit becomes the norm			0
@entity260 is a tough bloke , as amply demonstrated in the @entity289 ’ demolition of @entity230 in @entity291 last year			1
it is beneath him , @entity275 and others to act as con artists			0
@entity260 of @entity150 is treated by physios after his supposed hit from @entity39			1

@entity9 chief executive @entity0 ' comments about the play - off system being generated by money are surely beyond doubt
@entity303 supporters should get behind the low - key matches at the @entity95
@entity306 and @entity194 have made smart moves by organising *overseas* training camps
@entity229 has turned his back on @entity121 to play for @entity230
@entity150 hooker @entity260 should not have dived to win a penalty against @entity40 on friday night
