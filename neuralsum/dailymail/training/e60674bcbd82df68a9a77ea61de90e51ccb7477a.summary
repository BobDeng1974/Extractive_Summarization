by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 09:53 est , 14 december 2012 will @entity1 and @entity2 clashed during an electric episode of @entity4 last night as they expressed their strong views on the decriminalisation of drugs			1
the controversial author and former heroin addict told the @entity12 journalist to ' take a chill pill ' during their furious arguments on the @entity17 programme			1
mr @entity1 , who once snorted heroin on the then - prime minister @entity19 's plane , argued that drug use should be legalised in order to focus on treating addicts			1
but mr @entity2 responded that his claims were based on ' propaganda '			1
scroll down to watch fight ! : a furious row erupted on @entity4 last night			0
from left to right writer @entity1 , @entity27 , co-founder of @entity28 , @entity30 @entity29 , international development secretary and the @entity12 's @entity2 the panellists , who were joined in @entity33 by minister @entity29 , @entity35 's @entity34 and beer magnate @entity27 , were speaking in the wake of calls to set up a royal commission into the possible decriminalisation of drugs			1
the suggestion has opened another crack in the @entity44 after @entity45 was quick to dismiss the idea but @entity47 urged him to show ' courage ' and ' tell the truth ' about the need for reform			0
mr @entity2 is a staunch conservative who has repeatedly spoken out about the need to crack down on drug use and recently published a book on the topic			2
mr @entity1 , by contrast , has opened up about his own struggle with drug addiction , and is a strong supporter of reform to current legislation on drugs			2
he admitted snorting a line of heroin along the side of the wash basin as he flew with @entity19 's press team on an election campaign flight from @entity70 to the @entity71 in april 1997			2
despite initially denying the claim , the writer later admitted going to the toilet during the flight to snort , saying : ' so i was smacked out on the prime minister 's jet - big deal			0
' ms @entity29 , the international development secretary , began the discussion by arguing that the current laws were working well as she claimed that the number of drug addicts was at a record low			0
passion : mr @entity2 and mr @entity1 have both been outspoken on the topic of drug legislation fan : student @entity89 was one of many viewers who welcomed the aggressive clash not keen : mp @entity92 was less impressed with the high - octane argument on @entity4 mr @entity1 broke in to say , ' compared to what , 1630 ? ' , prompting appreciative laughter from his rival mr @entity2			1
he then launched a fierce attack on the @entity92 mp 's comments , saying : ' i do n't think you know anything about it , @entity29 - i get that strong feeling that you actually know nothing about it			2
' the author went on to claim that the majority of drug users were healthy and otherwise law - abiding and that government intervention should be targeted to addicts - but mr @entity2 unsurprisingly took issue with his argument			2
' you 've had a very long go , i think it 's time somebody else said something intelligent , ' the columnist said			0
' we have decriminalised drugs in this country - if the police can even be bothered with someone caught in possession of cannabis , the most likely treatment is something called a " cannabis warning " , which was invented by the police without even asking @entity130 , which means you are let off			0
' when asked why the @entity132 had called for an investigation into decriminalisation if drugs were effectively legal anyway , mr @entity2 pointed to the effect of international legalisation efforts			1
' they want a royal commission because there is a very very powerful and well - financed international campaign to legalise drugs so that various wicked people can make very large sums of money out of selling them to the population , ' he said			0
@entity147 - to - head : other panellists were left as bystanders to the fiery clashes between the outspoken pair panel : the pair were joined by ( left to right ) @entity27 , @entity29 , @entity154 and @entity34 but mr @entity1 ridiculed mr @entity2 ' call for stronger enforcement of the law , asking if he knew how many people were currently in possession of illegal narcotics			1
' i 've no idea , how would i know ? ' , mr @entity2 replied			2
he agreed that it would be impossible to jail all drug users , but pointed out : ' the point of having a proper criminal law is not to put people in prison , but to deter people from committing stupid crimes			0
' showing his irritation at his rival 's arguments , the journalist muttered : ' it 's so simple , anyone could answer that - almost			0
' repeating his claim that drugs have been effectively decriminalised for the past four decades , mr @entity2 said : ' until this point sinks in , we ca n't have an intelligent discussion ... people need to deal with some facts on this , instead of propaganda			1
' chairman @entity154 replied , ' we ca n't have a one - man discussion , ' and asked ms @entity34 to respond to the suggestion that the @entity189 should ' go down the @entity191 route ' by focussing on treatment			0
@entity191 's example was explicitly singled out by the select committee , who pointed to the fact that users of heroin and cocaine are offered rehabilitation rather than punished as a possible model for @entity189 drugs law			2
after another question from the audience on the topic , mr @entity2 was so keen to display his passion that mr @entity1 joked : ' take a chill pill , @entity208			1
' the animosity between the two men did not go unnoticed by their fellow panellists			0
ms @entity34 , the shadow minister for crime prevention , called for a national discussion on drugs , ' with perhaps even mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 taking part in that debate at the same time as each other '			1
' pity the poor chairman , ' mr @entity154 quipped			0
but mr @entity2 was not the only panellist to face a tongue - lashing from the famously acerbic mr @entity1			1
when @entity27 , who founded the company which makes @entity28 , said he worried about the possibility of his children becoming addicted to drugs , the author said : ' my biggest fear is that my children become alcoholics , but you got a peerage for flogging beer			0
' @entity234 users joked about the clash between the journalist and the novelist - student @entity89 wrote : ' why do n't we just have a # bbcqt edition of @entity239 with @entity2 and @entity1 beating each other off podiums with big cushions on sticks ? ' however , not all viewers were so delighted by the fiery exchanges , as @entity35 mp @entity92 tweeted : ' oh god			1
drugs with @entity2 and @entity1			1
might have to go to bed			0
' watch the highlight of the bitter fight here or see the full exchange on @entity254			0
