the chief operating officer of @entity1 has apologised for the manipulation of 700,000 users ' accounts in a controversial secret study			1
@entity7 's comments were the first from a @entity1 executive since it was revealed that the social network altered users ' newsfeeds to see if it had an effect on their emotions			1
it was also a climb down from tuesday 's insistence that it was an experiment covered by the network 's terms and conditions			0
the data - scientists were trying to collect evidence to prove their thesis that people 's moods could spread like an ' emotional contagion ' depending on the type of the content that they were reading			1
none of the participants in the @entity1 experiments were explicitly asked for their permission , though the social network 's terms of use appears to allow for the company to manipulate what appears in users ' news feeds however it sees fits			1
@entity1 's data - use policy says the @entity61 - based company can deploy user information for ' internal operations , including troubleshooting , data analysis , testing , research and service improvement			1
' ms @entity7 is in @entity23 where she addressed a gathering during a session organised by @entity71 in @entity72			0
she said : ' this was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products , and that was what it was ; it was poorly communicated			0
' and for that communication we apologise			0
we never meant to upset you			0
' she also told television network @entity84 in @entity23 during an interview that ' we clearly communicated really badly about this and that we really regret			0
' ms @entity7 was in @entity72 to meet entrepreneurs and businesswomen at a session organised by @entity71 in @entity72 later she added : ' @entity1 has apologised and certainly we never want to do anything that upsets users			1
' her comments come as it emerged today the @entity94 information commissioner said that it wants to learn more about the circumstances underlying the study carried out by two @entity99 universities and @entity1			1
the study concluded that people were more likely to post negative updates about their lives after the volume of positive information appearing in their @entity1 feeds had been purposefully reduced by the researchers			1
the opposite reaction occurred when the number of negative posts appeared in people 's news feeds			1
the inquiry is being coordinated with authorities in @entity116 , where @entity1 has headquarters for its @entity119 operations , as well as with @entity121 regulators			0
the concern over @entity1 's experiment comes amid interest in @entity119 about beefing up data - protection rules			2
the @entity126 last month ruled that @entity127 must respond to users ' requests seeking to remove links to personal information			0
it emerged at the weekend that @entity1 allowed researchers to manipulate content as part of a study into emotions @entity138 , a @entity139 assistant professor of behavioural science , said businesses regularly do studies on how to influence behaviour			1
she cited the example of @entity1 and @entity145 experimenting with showing different groups of people slightly different versions of their websites to see if one is better than another at getting customers to buy products			2
' on the other hand , it 's extremely understandable that many people are upset that their behaviour may have been manipulated for purely scientific purposes without their consent , ' she said			2
' in particular , @entity1 's user base is so wide that everyone wonders if they were in the experiment			2
' @entity1 's director of policy in @entity119 , @entity165 , told @entity166 : ' it ’s clear that people were upset by this study and we take responsibility for it			2
' we want to do better in the future and are improving our process based on this feedback			0
' the study was done with appropriate protections for people ’s information and we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have			0
' an official statement from the site added : ' our academic research and publication proposals are reviewed internally when proposals are made and before they are submitted for publication			0
' this review analyses the impact on user data , including appropriate safeguards to help ensure the research does not disclose information associated with a specific person ’s @entity1 account and that it uses the minimum amount of data required for the study			2

@entity7 apologised for ' poor communication ' of the study
@entity1 never meant to upset users with the secret research
emerged that network manipulated news feeds of about 700,000 accounts
was part of a study to see if people 's moods are affected by content
