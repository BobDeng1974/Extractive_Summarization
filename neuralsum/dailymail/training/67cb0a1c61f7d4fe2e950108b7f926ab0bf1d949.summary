a music video on @entity1 went viral not because the song is on the top of the charts but because the singer 's bikini top is nearly torn off by an adorable little dog			1
@entity8 of @entity9 posted her music video on @entity1 at the beginning of october along with a video clip of her fighting to keep her bathing suit on as a cute puppy tries to tear it off at a sandy beach @entity17 beach			1
since posting her music video cover of ' @entity21 ' from @entity23 's @entity22 online with her band the @entity24 , it got an impressive 27,997 views			1
the clip is cleverly named , ' bikini fail feat cute puppy			0
' @entity8 was pleased with the number of people who watched her puppy video but she reminded her ' fans ' to pay attention to the music in addition to the wonderful beach view			2
she fronts her folk band along with her equally tanned and blonde male counterpart @entity61			0
' hey everyone ! @entity8 here ( the girl from the video ) thanks so much for watching but i must say , it 's crazy what the world decides to make viral			2
that same day we were out filming a fun little music video for my folk duo - @entity24 , ' she says			1
she 's in a band : you may or may not care but @entity8 's in a band ( and she wears very small bikini tops ) and there 's a boy with flippy blonde hair named @entity61 in it as well look familiar ? : in her cover of @entity80 from @entity23 's a @entity22 , @entity8 uses a fork to comb the sand out of her tousled blonde hair ' those songs / videos take a considerable amount of time , effort and talent and do n't get 1/100 of the love			1
while i no doubt appreciate that people enjoy this little moment i 'd love if they 'd head over and show a little love to the music and art , ' she writes keeping her sense of humor afloat			0
the video covers a @entity23 favorite ' @entity21 ' from @entity101 and features the bikini clad blonde in a series of familiar film poses			0
in one moment she uses a fork to comb her hair just like @entity109 does in the film			0
she holds coins in her hands and dramatically throws them into the water			0
similarly to @entity109 in a @entity22 who loses her voice when the evil @entity115 steals it from her , instead of just being a beautiful object , @entity8 wants her music to resonate instead .			2
