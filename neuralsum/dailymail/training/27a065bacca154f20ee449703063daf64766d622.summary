spoken out : @entity0 , chief constable for @entity1 , has been flown out to @entity3 's notorious ' shooting galleries ' by the @entity4 as research a senior police officer has been given a platform by the @entity4 to call for heroin to be given out free to drug addicts			1
@entity0 , the chief constable of @entity1 , argues that heroin users should be given drugs paid for by the taxpayer to ‘ take money out of drug dealers ’ pockets ’			1
he says it ‘ is n’t practical ’ for the police simply to arrest drug addicts and says he is ‘ proud to be a social worker ’ as well as a law enforcer			1
mr @entity0 was flown to @entity3 to make a short documentary for the programme , @entity24			1
in the piece , he visits drug consumption rooms - also known as shooting galleries - where drug addicts are given free needles and can take their drugs without fear of arrest			1
he tells viewers : ‘ we should provide the heroin , the state should provide the heroin , and we take the 600 pounds out of the drug dealers ’ pocket			2
‘ i know there will be those in high office who will be angry at me saying this , but i do n’t want to be the former chief constable or the retired chief constable who says this			1
‘ it ’s time a serving chief constable spoke out			1
’ last night anti-cannabis campaigners criticised his comments and attacked the @entity4 for commissioning the programme			2
@entity52 , from @entity53 , said the chief constable ’s comments ‘ beggar belief ’ and were ‘ condoning ’ drug use			1
she said there were huge problems with police giving away heroin - including addicts blighting communities while hanging around waiting to be given their next fix			2
she also argued the criminals who currently make money from drugs would simply switch to other illegal ways of making money			0
mrs @entity52 criticised the @entity4 for paying to provide a platform for mr @entity0 ’s views , and accused the corporation of deliberately chasing controversy to boost ratings			2
in a short documentary he will look at facilities like this @entity78 one that gives addicts free heroin in a controlled room she told the @entity83 : ‘ this is what the @entity4 does			1
the @entity4 just wants its controversial programmes and high profile programmes to get people to watch and listen			0
’ the row came amid figures showing police are already taking action against fewer people for using cannabis			0
in 2012 , the @entity83 revealed how senior police had decided to adopt a ‘ less robust enforcement approach ’ on possession of the @entity98 drug			0
over the course of the year to september 2013 , the number of formal warnings issued for cannabis use fell from 72,171 to 65,969 - a fall of nine per cent			0
in 2009 , almost 100,000 warnings were issued			0
mrs @entity52 said it was the an indication the police were ‘ no longer bothering ’			0
last year mr @entity0 hit the headlines when he said the war on drugs had ‘ comprehensively failed ’ and compared it to failed prohibition - era efforts to ban alcohol			2
in the new documentary , he says only a fifth of his work is law enforcement and crime fighting , and around half is ‘ concern for safety ’			0
anti-drugs campaigners have blasted mr @entity0 's appreciation for these schemes which ' condone ' drug use ‘ so when you accuse me of being a social worker i ’m proud to be a social worker as well as a tough law enforcer , ’ he says			1
he is questioned by anti-drugs author and journalist @entity131 , who calls for the police to actively pursue drug users to deter them from buying and taking more drugs			2
‘ i ’m advocating the pursuit of the possessors of drugs rather than the pursuit of the dealers of drugs , ’ mr @entity131 says			0
‘ if anyone is caught in possession arrested prosecuted and if found guilty they are punished in a deterrent fashion to deter them from future action and to deter other people from possessing drugs			0
’ but mr @entity0 says there are 1,700 registered addicts in his force area and only 1,200 police officers			1
‘ you ca n’t just say to cops ‘ go out there and arrest people until it stops ’ because that is n’t practical			0
’ he adds : ‘ i know what i ’m saying is controversial and some politicians do n’t like it			0
