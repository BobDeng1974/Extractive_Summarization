winning away from home to break an 11 - match losing sequence and out of the bottom three , perhaps @entity1 owner @entity0 has found his ‘ dream manager ’ after all			1
the @entity6 chief tweeted before the game that his ‘ dream ’ boss – thought to be @entity10 - was lined up to replace @entity11 , who quit last week having failed to take a single point on the road this season			1
but @entity0 could well be having a rethink after caretaker @entity16 steered the @entity17 ’s to their first away triumph in the @entity20 in nearly two years			2
@entity1 striker @entity21 gave @entity16 's side a two - goal lead just before half - time when he unleashed a brilliant volley @entity25 could only stand and watch as @entity21 's strike flew into the top corner to double @entity1 's lead at the @entity29 @entity31 striker @entity21 and @entity33 defender @entity32 watch on as the strike flies into the top corner @entity21 is mobbed by his team - mates as @entity1 took a commanding lead against @entity39 's side on tuesday night @entity41 wheels away in celebration after the @entity1 midfielder gives the visitors the lead against @entity33 @entity33 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity25 6 ; @entity46 6 ( @entity47 63 , 6 ) , @entity32 5 , @entity48 5.5 , @entity49 5.5 ; @entity50 5 ; @entity51 5 ( @entity52 46 , 5.5 ) , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6 ; @entity55 5.5 ( @entity56 81 ) , @entity57 5.5 subs not used : @entity47 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 booked : @entity53 41 , @entity52 82 manager : @entity39 5 @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity64 8 ; @entity65 7 ( @entity66 85 ) @entity67 7 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 6 ; @entity70 7.5 ( @entity71 52 , 6 ) , @entity72 6.5 , @entity73 6.5 , @entity74 6 ; @entity41 7.5 ( @entity75 75 , 6 ) ; @entity21 7.5 subs not used : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 scorer ( s ) : @entity41 17 , @entity21 45 booked : @entity21 34 , @entity68 70 , @entity72 78 manager : @entity16 8 referee : @entity83 attendance : 39,077 man of the match : @entity64 how @entity21 doubled @entity1 's lead			1
click here for more match zone it is , of course , almost certain that he will return to his role as academy chief			2
but this win – achieved thanks to goals from @entity41 and @entity21 and a save - of - the - season contender from @entity98 – was as impressive as it was surprising			1
and @entity16 said : ‘ i thought i deserved the job even before this ! ‘ this would be some way to go out though			2
i ’m sure i ’ll still be involved in some way in developing the club			1
i ’m also academy manager and i ’ve got plenty of work on my hands			2
‘ but i will carry on in this role until told otherwise			0
’ @entity16 and his team were just arriving at the @entity29 when @entity0 , who has ruled out @entity109 for the job , tweeted : ‘ think i have got my dream manager			0
still a bit to go but i ’m very happy			0
’ @entity116 beats @entity50 to @entity70 's cross and powers a header past @entity25 to open the scoring the @entity121 is congratulated by his team - mates as @entity1 looked for their first points away from home this season @entity125 international @entity41 falls to the floor in agony after a challenge with @entity33 midfielder @entity50 @entity41 lays stricken on the turf after appearing to injure his knee in the challenge and had to be replaced @entity131 later left the field on a stretcher in the second half after picking up the injury @entity136 , exiled under former boss @entity11 , came on as a second - half substitute @entity1 defender @entity68 has words with former @entity139 team - mate @entity57 during the clash against @entity33 @entity64 dives to his left to deny @entity33 striker @entity57 a third @entity20 goal since returning to @entity139 @entity143 , however , is currently in charge of @entity147 side @entity145 and it wo n’t be easy to release the former @entity150 manager from his contract			1
should that prove the case then @entity16 could be set for an extended stay in the role			0
he made six changes – including a recall for @entity68 – and saw his side boss the first half to lead 2 - 0 at the break			1
@entity41 headed a stylish 17th - minute opener from @entity70 ’s inviting centre and cracked the post soon after			1
within 60 seconds of that miss the hosts had the chance to draw level , @entity57 lifting above @entity64 and the crossbar after escaping @entity67 inside the six – yard area			0
then came @entity64 ’s stupendous save			0
@entity54 loaded a cross from the right , @entity55 peeled free and planted a header on goal from point - blank range			1
goal ! or so we thought			0
@entity64 had other ideas , instinctively diverting the ball onto the bar before spinning and shovelling clear as it bounced on the line			0
@entity72 tussles with @entity33 striker @entity55 during the clash at the @entity29 @entity184 ( left ) amd @entity16 watch on as @entity1 pick up their first points away from home all season @entity64 and @entity74 applaud the travelling supporters , who finally have something to cheer on the road this season @entity33 boss @entity39 congratulates @entity1 caretaker manager @entity16 after the final whistle @entity64 ’s stop was barely believable and by half - time @entity1 were in dreamland			1
@entity70 again swept over from the right and @entity21 applied an emphatic finish from 12 yards			1
@entity16 said : ‘ i ’m sure it ’s not just my magic wand – the players have to take a lot of credit			0
‘ we did n’t over-celebrate at the end because we ’re capable of playing like that			0
i know there was speculation before the game but we tried to keep ourselves focussed			0
‘ it was important to win to stay close to teams in that area and it ’s given us great belief			0
’ @entity39 , meanwhile , was from pleased with @entity33 ’s lacklustre performance , leaving them just two points above the drop zone			1
he said : ‘ you can not start like that at home in such an important game			2
‘ it ’s a massive missed opportunity to go clear of the bottom three			2
when we are in a good situation we always seem to take a step back – it happens too often , we need to change that			0
