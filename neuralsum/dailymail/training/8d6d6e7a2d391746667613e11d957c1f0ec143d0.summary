@entity1 striker @entity0 has the chance to further prove to @entity3 on saturday that he is worthy of a place in @entity7 's squad next season			1
but @entity3 is set to farm @entity0 out on loan again			1
@entity0 , 22 , spent last season in @entity10 playing for @entity11			1
but @entity3 is more inclined to loan @entity0 to a @entity13 club - at least until january - this season			1
@entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are all interested			0
out to impress : @entity0 trains on friday ahead of @entity1 's semi-final against @entity20 rising star : @entity3 will have been impressed by @entity0 at the @entity22 but will still end him on loan club promotion : wenger at dinner with @entity27 ( left ) , @entity28 ( third left ) and @entity30 ( second right ) one of the features of this @entity22 has been the number of headed goals - there have been 32 so far			1
surely the best remains @entity36 ’s supreme diving header in @entity20 ’s opening win over @entity38			0
it ’s nearly twice as likely for a goal to be scored in the second half of saturday 's games			0
so far 94 have been scored in the second half compared to 57 in the first half , with seven having been struck in extra time			0
@entity46 has stated he has nothing to prove to @entity48 when he plays for @entity49 against @entity50 on saturday			1
even if he wanted to make a point , it is a bit late for that			0
new manager @entity55 has agreed with the club ’s hierarchy to sell the player signed from @entity16 for £ 27million last summer			1
defiant : @entity46 says he has nothing to prove to @entity48 fans after a poor season a move back to @entity16 or @entity18 is on the cards but both clubs wo n’t want to pay more than a cut price £ 12m			1
a loan move is a possibility			0
former @entity69 boss @entity68 has said he no longer wants to see @entity70 win the @entity22 in their own back yard because they are not playing @entity73 football			1
his point is backed up by the fact that their goals in the knockout phase have been scored by their defenders - the strongest part of their team - with @entity82 netting twice and @entity83 once			2
indeed @entity84 star @entity82 - now of @entity85 - could become the icon of this team if they go on to win the tournament			2
with pin - up star @entity92 , still their top scorer with four goals , ruled out of the @entity22 , @entity82 - who scored a wonder free - kick in the 2 - 1 win over @entity97 - has now emerged as @entity70 's talisman - much to @entity68 ’s dismay			1
former @entity101 striker of the @entity103 @entity102 was the first player in @entity105 football to be dubbed a supersub because of his knack of coming off the bench ( in the days when there was only one sub ) and scoring vital goals			0
this @entity22 has become the tournament of the super sub			2
so far 29 goals have been scored by subs compared to 15 in 2010 one to watch : lets hope it ’s a sight to behold rather than a kicking - or diving - match and we see @entity125 or @entity36 - or both - rise to the occasion and set up a semi-final most likely against @entity119 and @entity50 in a battle of @entity121			0
time to shine : @entity36 has the chance to lead @entity128 into the @entity22 semi-finals on saturday @entity22 moment : after putting @entity69 to the sword in the quarter finals of the 1986 @entity22 finals , @entity131 then put on another one - man demolition show in the semis against @entity49 - scoring twice in @entity50 's 2 - 0 win			2
one - man show : @entity131 scored twice as @entity50 beat @entity49 in the 1986 @entity22 semi-finals i say : @entity144 ’s nightmare performance as commentator in the @entity69 v @entity142 game has seen @entity147 move up the packing order			1
and the @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity69 midfielder has taken his chance superbly			0
his comments and quips in the classic @entity49 - @entity156 game were class			0
and the way he constantly berated @entity46 bordered on comic genius			2
but i hope he does n’t pursue a career in broadcasting because , given his insight into the game , he should go into coaching			2
i have spent time in his company and his knowledge and willingness to cut through the b * * * * * * * is impressive			0
@entity147 seems to have all the credentials to become a top @entity173 : @entity174 ’s are offering 7 - 2 for both @entity119 and @entity36 to score within 90 minutes .			0

@entity1 striker has impressed at the @entity22
@entity0 spent last season on loan at @entity11
@entity82 could become @entity70 's talisman in @entity92 's *absence*
@entity48 boss @entity55 will sell @entity46
@entity147 should go in to coaching not broadcasting
