' @entity0 , 14 , died from after suffering an embolism from the pressurized tank depriving her brain of oxygen			1
the craze of inhaling helium is a party trick spreading across the @entity18 , with users getting a comical high - pitched voice after inhalation , although it does not hold any ' high ' effect			1
but the teen 's tragic death in what her friends thought was light - heartened fun , exposes the dangers of inhaling or ' huffing ' helium , especially from a pressurized tank			1
ms @entity0 had told her parents she was going to a slumber party last saturday , but she actually went to a condo in @entity34 , @entity35 , where police say the older sister of one of her friends was throwing a party with alcohol and marijuana			1
after drinking on the drive , and downing more drinks in the condo , @entity0 took a turn on a tank of helium that everyone else was inhaling to make their voices sound funny			1
' that helium tank got going around , ' said @entity0 's stepfather , @entity52 , who learned what happened from talking to @entity0 's friends at the party			1
' it got to my daughter			2
my daughter did n't want to do it			1
they put a mask up to her face			0
they said it would be ok			0
" it 's not gon na hurt you			0
it 'll just make you laugh and talk funny			0
" mourning : @entity0 's mother @entity71 , center , cries with her husband , @entity52			1
they can not believe something like helium killed their daughter instead , she collapsed out and later died at a hospital , the result of an obstruction in a blood vessel caused by inhaling helium from a pressurized tank			1
@entity0 's best friend @entity84 said that she had never used drugs and had not drunk before and the party was the first time she consumed alcohol			1
' i think she felt i think she felt like she was going to let us down if she did n't do it as this guys was holding it up to her mouth , telling her to do it , ' said miss @entity84			2
@entity0 had told her parents she was going to a slumber party last saturday , but she actually went to a condo in @entity34 , @entity35 , where she collapsed and never regain consciousness she performed cpr on her best friend while others called 911 , but miss @entity0 did not respond			1
miss @entity84 said the young man who pressured miss @entity0 left when he heard others call police			1
police have arrested 27 - year - old @entity107 , who lived in the condo , on charges of providing alcohol and marijuana to minors			1
devastated : @entity0 's best friend @entity84 who performed cpr on the teen , said ' i think she felt i think she felt like she was going to let us down if she did n't do it as this guys was holding it up to her mouth , telling her to do it ' arrested : @entity107 , who was the host of the party where @entity0 died , faces charges from police @entity52 said the kids had four wine coolers each in the car , and four mixed drinks at the condo , before they started passing around the helium			1
police said it was an 8 - gallon canister , which is availability at many stores and the kids were taking hits directly from the tank			0
' about 11.30 we got a phone call from police saying they were doing cpr on our daughter , ' said @entity52			1
at the hospital , they were told that @entity0 had died			1
@entity71 said she feels like her daughter was stolen from her			2
' my whole chest is collapsed and my heart is broken , ' she said through sobs			0
' i do n't understand			2
' she says her daughter was a goofy , nerdy eighth - grader who struggled with her weight , was just starting to notice boys , got top grades in school , had posters of @entity154 all over her room and wanted to grow up to be a marine biologist			2
the family moved from @entity158 , @entity35 , to @entity159 about a year ago , and @entity0 had just gotten over the difficulty of adjusting to eighth grade in a new school			2
dr. @entity163 , associate professor of emergency medicine at the @entity165 in @entity166 , said what happens is similar to when a scuba diver surfaces too quickly			0
a gas bubble gets into the bloodstream , perhaps through some kind of tear in a blood vessel , and can block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke			0
death from inhaling helium is so rare that the @entity179 lumps it in with other gases , such as methane and propane			2
only three deaths were recorded in 2010 , said spokeswoman @entity185			0
but police say huffing is a growing trend across the country			0
officials are worried that when the tanks are on shelves with few or no limitations , choosing between proper use and abuse is at the buyer 's hands			0
doctors have said ' huffing ' helium can have potentially catastrophic effects on the person who abuses it , cutting off oxygen in the body , essentially causing strangulation			2
and inhaling the pressurized air straight from the nozzle of a tank can also cause direct damage to the lung or separate it from the lining outside of the lung so it ca n't move normally , as well as causing a gas bubble in ms @entity0 's case			1
the gas is also commonly seen in suicide kits - mail - order hoods sold out of @entity35 and elsewhere that can be attached to a helium tank by people who want to kill themselves			2
in those cases , the helium crowds out the oxygen , asphyxiating a person			0
it 's important to remind kids that ingesting any substance - for the sake of getting high or just changing their voices - can be dangerous , said @entity233 , executive director of @entity234 , @entity234			0
mr @entity233 said the first defense is for parents to tell their kids about the dangers of certain substances			0
he said kids need to also ask themselves whether going along with the crowd at a party is worth it			0
' peer pressure is a very potent force , ' he said			1
' we 've all gone through it growing up			0
it 's getting somebody to pause and think and evaluate the situation and determine , is this something that 's going to have a bad consequence			0
' four men who were at the party have been questioned by police , but have not been charged , said @entity256 lt @entity255			0
more charges may be filed after police turn over their evidence to the district attorney			0
her family has set up a foundation , @entity264 , to spread the word about the dangers of inhaling helium .			0

@entity0 told her parents she was staying at her friends , but went to a party with alcohol , marijuana and helium
after one intake of the helium she passed out and best friend performed cpr on her at the party
' my daughter did n't want to do it *...* it was peer pressure ' says stepfather
