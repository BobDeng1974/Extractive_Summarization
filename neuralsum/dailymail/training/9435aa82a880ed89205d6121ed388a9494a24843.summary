it claims the 52 - year - old admitted he was ‘ paralysed with tiredness ’ and his ‘ immune system was failing ’ because of his job			1
but with @entity18 continuing to flop in the @entity19 , and scheduling clashes dogging the @entity22 version , it seems there will be no respite in the near future			1

‘ i have to get back to where i was years ago			0
i have to stop reading texts at three in the morning and making calls later and later			0
’ he also told friends that running two high - profile shows in the @entity19 and @entity22 had left him at breaking point			1
his enforced spell of rest meant he missed key promotional time with @entity18 ’s new @entity22 line - up , which includes @entity56			1
but @entity3 revealed he was told to take a rest because his life had ‘ become like a night shift ’ , adding : ‘ i had forgotten the sensation of the morning			0
’ his company @entity62 officially stated that he had come down with bronchitis			0
it is understood he took a three - week break from work to recuperate fully			1
the revelations come as ratings in @entity69 for saturday night ’s episode of @entity18 dropped to a series low of 7.7million , with viewers apparently put off by the decision to show fewer performances and more ‘ behind - the - scenes ’ shots			1
sleeping beauty : @entity3 was advised to get plenty of rest from his doctor after becoming a ' weird vampire ' the ratings will be a blow to @entity3 as they are some way below the average of more than 10million for the 2010 series			0
