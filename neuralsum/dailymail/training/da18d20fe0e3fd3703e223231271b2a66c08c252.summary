by @entity0 councils are being investigated for an ‘ illegal ’ parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines			1
documents have shown that at least three local authorities are setting targets or incentivising parking officers to ticket motorists despite this being banned under official rules			1
local government minister @entity12 has launched a probe into the contracts and said they will be stopped if proven illegal			1
councils are being investigated for an ' illegal ' parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines the @entity23 @entity22 investigation looked into three councils in @entity25 - amid fears the same practices could be being used across the country			1
it found @entity31 ’s contract with parking firm @entity33 sets a bonus of up to £ 20 for every ticket issued over an annual baseline of 72,000 penalty charge notices			0
@entity38 allows contractor @entity39 to band different wardens according to their hourly ticket issue rate , stating no more than 10 per cent can fall below ‘ band two ’			0
@entity43 , which runs parking enforcement for @entity45 , reveals in its contract that it ‘ requires ’ the issue of 218,000 penalty notices a year - a figure which was later downsized to 205,000			0
after reading the legal documents , mr @entity12 said : ‘ these look like entirely the wrong kind of contract motivating and encouraging the staff to go out and penalise people and they only get paid well if they penalise somebody			1
that ’s the wrong way to run the structure			0
’ he added that lawyers at the @entity60 would now scrutinise the documents to see if they can be challenged in court			2
‘ [ if ] it ’s proven they are illegal this kind of behaviour has to stop ’ , he added			1
statutory guidance to @entity68 prohibits councils or private companies from setting targets for either the number of tickets they issue or the revenue they raise			1
it states that performance and rewards or penalties should never be based on the number of parking tickets issued nor should authorities set targets			1
@entity12 has launched a probe into the contracts and says they will be stopped if proven illegal commercial litigation lawyer @entity88 says the contracts appear to be ‘ a serial breach of government guidance by a whole series of councils ostensibly acting independently but quite clearly cleverly drafted by lawyers to circumvent the government guidance on the subject ’			1
he described them as ‘ disgraceful , unacceptable - arguably unlawful ’			0
it comes as figures show the councils have racked up significant profits from parking last year			2
@entity102 council made a £ 5.7m profit from parking charges and fines - up £ 1m on the previous year			2
@entity106 had a parking surplus of £ 7.9m - £ 2m - while @entity108 made a £ 12m profit , more than double the previous year ’s profit			1
all three councils point out the number of tickets issued is falling			2
as for the contracts themselves , @entity45 says : ‘ this is not a target - it ’s a figure for guidance so @entity43 can plan the number of staff they will need			2
’ its contractor @entity43 said : ‘ @entity43 incurs no penalties for not issuing tickets and nor are there awards for issuing tickets			0
’ @entity31 said they ‘ never set targets for revenue from parking enforcement income ’			2
it also pointed out its contract ‘ commenced in 2006 , predating the statutory guidance by two years ’ but said ‘ the council lawyers remain content with the integrity of the contract ’			0
@entity38 insisted that it ‘ sets no targets for the issue of penalty charge notices nor gives the contractor any incentive for its officers to issue more than they feel necessary ’			0
however , it conceded it has removed that section of the contract			0
the @entity143 revealed @entity43 , formerly @entity144 , @entity146 ’s biggest parking enforcer , had issued thousands of wrongful tickets to unsuspecting motorists so wardens could hit targets in 2010			0
a whistleblower provided evidence that showed at one @entity25 local authority , managers wrote ‘ only cancel if appealed ’ on paperwork for dozens of tickets issued for no legitimate reason rather than simply cancel them .			0

documents show that at least three local authorities are setting targets
local government minister @entity12 has launched a probe into the contracts and says they will be stopped if proven illegal
