by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 11:41 est , 19 june 2013 the @entity2 parents of a two - year - old girl killed along with 12 other children and six adults at a @entity7 shopping mall fear the truth behind the blaze will never be known			1
authorities in the richest country in the world have reneged on their promise to share findings from a government report into the fire at the @entity18 shopping mall in @entity19 in may last year			1
they also failed to include the report as evidence in the trial of seven people including the nursery owners , four mall managers and an inspector from @entity7 's @entity28 , who were charged with negligence and failing to adhere to safety regulations			1
tragedy : @entity32 and @entity33 with their daughter , @entity34 , at the @entity18 mall in @entity19 , @entity7 , where the two - and - a - half - year - old was killed a verdict in what has been described as a show trial is expected on thursday , but @entity32 , who was teaching at @entity40 at the time of the fire , is pessimistic that there will be justice for his daughter @entity34 's death			1
' i ’m not confident , ' mr @entity32 told @entity48			2
' the entire system has failed us			2
' his wife , @entity51 , who watched helplessly as fire swept through the mall , trapping her daughter and other children in the nursery , added : ' everyone says it ’s a trial for show			1
' parents of other children who were trapped in the @entity64 nursery and died in the fire , have also complained about a lack of information from @entity7			1
' it ’s been a deafening silence , ' @entity67 , whose triplets were killed in the fire , said			1
' we do n’t know what happened			2
we do n’t know if any improvements have been made			0
' an investigation into the fire at the mall found a ' lack of adherence to required laws , systems , and measure by all concerned parties to different degree [ s ]			1
this includes adherence to design , license , and safety conditions , which contributed to [ the ] @entity18 catastrophe			1
' it is believed the fire was started by a short circuit in a fluorescent light in the storeroom of a @entity96 shop			1
a civil defense officer told @entity98 that the toxic paint used to paint the mall , which is made to look like @entity101 complete with a sky mural throughout , caused the fire and smoke to spread			1
@entity34 and the other children left at the nursery , which was up a single flight of stairs , were trapped and killed by the noxious smoke			1
heartbreaking : @entity34 , aged two - and - a - half , from @entity109 , @entity2 , died when the blaze swept through a mall the hearing to determine criminal responsibility for the fire had previously been postponed four times before all seven defendants showed up to court			1
however , the local media in have been prevented from publishing details from the trial until the verdict , according to the @entity122			0
a civil defence officer told the hearing that @entity18 has been repeatedly fined for using a highly flammable paint in its mall decorations , which , when ignited , causes fire to spread quickly and is difficult to contain , according to @entity128			1
it was also noted that sprinklers that could have stopped the smoke did not appear to be functioning and @entity18 officials had not responded to requests to perform maintenance on the equipment			1
@entity34 's parents believe the little girl 's death could have been prevented			0
witnesses said when the fire alarm went off in the mall , security guards assured shoppers it was a false alarm			1
firefighters were also slow to respond , arriving almost an hour after witnesses first spotted smoke above the mall			2
firefighter @entity149 , who was one of the first to go into the blazing building , said the emergency services were not told there was a nursery in the mall until half an hour after they arrived			2
devastated : eyes swollen from weeping , the @entity157 parents supported each other at a memorial service the day after the fire grieving : friends did their best to console @entity67 and @entity164 during the service at @entity19 's @entity166 @entity67 and @entity164 , whose two - year - old triplets @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 died in the @entity64 nursery , said : ' we want an understanding of what actually went wrong and how to ensure it never happens again			2
' we all want answers and accountability ... it wo n't bring back our loved ones , but it will help to ensure this can never happen again			0
' ms @entity33 , from @entity109 , had been visiting her husband in @entity7 while he was working at a university at the time of the fire			1
after hearing about the fire she rushed to the mall but said she was forced to watch helplessly while her daughter was trapped inside			1
' i could see really thick black smoke was coming out of the mall , ' she said			2
but authorities would not allow her into the building , telling her : ' your kid is safe inside			0
' ' i even told one firefighter , " i can give you money " , ' she said			0
' please go check the nursery			0
they just looked at me like a crazy person who does n’t know what ’s going on			0
' the couple have hired lawyers and turned to senator @entity205 's office for help , but have not yet received the answers they are looking for			0
' we ’re not going to stop until we get that report , ' ms @entity33 said			0
the couple had no idea if their daughter was among the children until a reporter led them to a hospital where most of the bodies had been taken to			2
there , the couple were shown photographs of all the dead children			2
' at the hospital , when we went to the mortuary , they showed us pictures of dead kids			0
all the kids from the nursery were dead			0
they just asked me , " is this your kid , is this your kid ? " my kid was the last one			0
' @entity34 's body had no burn marks , which her family say is a sign her death could have been prevented			0
misled : @entity238 began billowing from the roof of the mall , but witnesses claim security guards told shoppers it was simply a false alarm tragedy : the fire quickly took hold , yet some shoppers have claimed that fire alarms failed to go off , or were barely audible ' @entity250 can happen			1
this death of kids and teachers could have been prevented			0
the death of everyone could have been prevented , ' ms @entity33 said			0
' there is such incompetence that it makes me angry right now			0
but i 'm so sad			0
' critics said that the government of the oil - rich nation , run by the @entity265 ruling family , is trying to cover up the findings as it prepares to host the @entity267 in 2022			1
the fire also came as the country was forced to counter criticism about its poor human rights record			2
more than 85 per cent of the population in the tiny country is made up of foreign nationals			0
rescue : firefighters climb on the roof of the mall to try to rescue children trapped inside while all foreign workers are subjected to forced blood tests , x-rays and finger printing , and can not leave the country without a signed permit from their employer , the workers used to keep up with the rapid construction of apartment blocks , offices and malls are also forced to work long hours in intense heat and on sites with poor safety records , according to @entity295			1
' @entity7 has been quite successful at giving off a progressive image when , in fact , the [ labor ] system is exploitative , ' @entity296 , of @entity295 , told @entity301			0
' it is the same old story			0
the @entity305 system , the confiscation of passports , the illegal charging of exorbitant agent fees , the inability for workers to access the courts for redress			0

@entity109 *professors* say @entity317 nation broke promise to reveal findings
13 children and six adults killed in @entity18 mall blaze
