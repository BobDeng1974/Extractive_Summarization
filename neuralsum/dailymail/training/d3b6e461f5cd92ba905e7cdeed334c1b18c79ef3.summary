by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 07:26 est , 9 november 2012 the @entity1 hit out at @entity2 and the @entity3 after repeating its threat to go to the police over what it regards as anti-semitic chanting at @entity9			1
@entity2 fans sent an open message of defiance to the @entity1 on thursday night when they chanted ' we 'll sing what we want ' and ' @entity15 ' throughout the club 's 3 - 1 home win over @entity18 in the @entity19			1
despite being a club with a traditionally large @entity23 following , @entity2 fans often refer to themselves as ' @entity24 ' or the ' @entity15 ' in chants during the club 's matches			1
' we 'll sing what we want ' : @entity2 fans were in defiant mood on thursday although @entity2 claim otherwise , the @entity1 say the phrase is anti-semitic and they have vowed to complain to the police under the @entity32 if supporters continue to use the chant beyond the november 20 deadline it has set			1
the @entity1 had monitors at the north @entity39 ground on thursday night who heard the chants and this morning it reiterated its commitment to report any such action to the police should fans continue their actions			2
' we are not going to let go on this , ' @entity1 chair @entity47 said			1
' after november 20 there is a potential that people will get a criminal conviction			1
if they want to run that risk then fine			0
we are n't in this for sensationalism			0
we think the vast majority of @entity2 fans are sensible and do not engage in @entity59			1
' it 's a very small minority who obviously do n't care about any offence			2
' their love of football is greater than their desire to deal with anti-semitism			1
' @entity2 refused to comment on the matter			1
the @entity39 club stick by the statement they released on wednesday which read : ' our guiding principle in respect of the " y - word " is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence			0
this has been the basis of prosecutions of fans of other teams to date			0
flying the flag : @entity47 has launched another attack on @entity2 supporters ' our fans adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect anti-semitic abuse			1
they do not use the term to others to cause any offence , they use it as a chant amongst themselves			0
' @entity47 believes the club have been misguided over the issue and claims fans can be prosecuted regardless of whether the songs are intended to cause offence			2
' under @entity108 of the @entity32 it does n't matter what the intent is of the individual or the crowd , if the words cause harassment , alarm , or distress to anyone watching then that is sufficient , ' @entity47 said			2
three and easy : @entity119 scored a hat - trick in @entity2 's win on thursday ' if a crowd of men were walking down @entity125 singing the y - word causing offence they would be arrested			2
it does n't make sense that they can make @entity9 a no - go area for law			0
' @entity47 ridiculed @entity2 's statement and claimed the @entity1 has widespread support for its campaign from within the @entity23 community			1
' we have no doubt there will be complaints ( to the police ) , ' @entity47 added			2
' if the @entity142 say they are going to look at prosecutions then there is a good chance it will stop			0
' @entity2 's statement is indefensible			2
i think if you went to the @entity148 , @entity149 or @entity150 and you made a statement like that you would face ridicule and condemnation			0
' it is a very sad day for @entity156 football when clubs feel they have to defend a term of abuse			0
' @entity47 also accused the @entity3 of a lack of interest in the @entity2 matter			1
' this is an appalling abdication of responsibility by the @entity3 , ' he said			0
' it 's a complete disgrace that they have stayed silent on this			0
' there is an inertia from the @entity3 over racism and anti-semitism			0
' you ca n't go and complain about racism and anti-semitism in @entity174 and then have it happening in your own back yard			0

society of @entity179 maintain call for ' criminal convictions after november 20 '
' small minority ' of @entity2 fans to blame for ' anti-semitic ' chanting , says @entity47
' their love of football is greater than their desire to deal with anti-semitism ' , adds @entity1 chief
