by @entity1 reporter scientists have hailed the ' incredible ' discovery of four new species of sea creature in deep ocean waters off the coast of @entity8			0
a large sea snail , two kinds of clam and a marine worm were found during @entity14 surveys around the @entity16 plateau in the north @entity17			1
the creatures had previously avoided detection despite decades of research in the area , located hundreds of miles off the north - west coast			0
a new species of snail called @entity25 is one of four sea creatures to have been discovered in deep ocean waters hundreds of miles off the north west coast of @entity8 international experts have confirmed the molluscs were previously unknown to science and the discovery is said to be potentially very significant			2
a cold seep or cold vent is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulphide , methane and other hydrocarbon - rich fluid seepage occurs			1
despite the term , the temperature of a seepage is not lower than surrounding sea water - in many cases the temperature is slightly higher			0
cold seeps develop over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity			0
oil and methane seep out of those fissures and emerge over an area several hundred metres wide			0
entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make - up of a cold seep			1
researchers say the existence of the clams and worm at a single site could indicate the presence of a cold seep , where hydrocarbons are released from the sea bed			1

entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make - up of a cold seep if confirmed it would be the first cold seep to be discovered in the @entity16 area			1
@entity88 from @entity89 , who oversaw the research on the deep water invertebrates , said : ' the discovery of these new species is absolutely incredible , especially when you consider that the sea snail measures a relatively large 10cm ( 4 inches ) yet has gone undetected for decades			1
the creatures ( @entity25 scotae , pictured ) had previously avoided detection despite decades of research in the area , located hundreds of miles off the north - west coast this clam named @entity103 say the existence of the clams and worm at a single site could indicate the presence of a cold seep , where hydrocarbons are released from the sea bed ' the project we were undertaking was designed to provide advice that would help balance both commercial fishing and conservation interests in the @entity16 area			1
' the potential cold seep and its dependant community of marine life is a great find as it is just the sort of habitat we were hoping to pick up on these surveys			1
' @entity89 has been able to narrow down the location of the potential cold seep to a small area 260 miles west of the @entity127 in the @entity16 - @entity129 basin			1
' further research is now needed , which would involve going down to take a look at the ocean floor three - quarters of a mile underwater			0
' mr @entity88 said he was particularly excited by the discovery of the marine worm @entity137 which is the first of its kind to be found in the @entity17			1
it was discovered by international bivalve expert dr @entity141 inside one of the clams he was confirming as a new species at his laboratory at the @entity146			0
mr @entity88 said he was particularly excited by the discovery of the marine worm @entity147 ( pictured ) which is the first of its kind to be found in the @entity17 the worm ( magnified head , pictured ) has not yet been named and is currently being examined at the @entity146 @entity8 's environment secretary @entity150 said : ' @entity8 waters cover an area around five times bigger than our land mass and are miles deep in places , and these hidden gems offer a fascinating glimpse of the treasures that still await discovery under the waves			1
' the area where these species were found is not currently fished and the confirmation of a cold seep is likely to result in the region being closed to bottom contact fishing			2
' @entity169 @entity8 director @entity168 said : ' perhaps only in @entity8 would you find people getting excited about something known as a " cold seep "			2
' however , if true , then it is no less important a discovery as the much better known hydrothermal vents , found in other parts of the world			0
' they would give us a unique opportunity to observe some species unlikely to be found anywhere else on the planet			0
' these latest discoveries underline the need for a precautionary approach in the management and use of our seas			0
' both the clams ( @entity192 , pictured ) and marine worm were discovered around 260 miles west of the @entity127 at a depth of about three quarters of a mile both the clams and marine worm were discovered around 260 miles west of the @entity127 at a depth of about three quarters of a mile			2
the sea snails were found in water around a mile deep over an area approximately 80 - 260 miles west of the islands			2
the sea snail @entity203 and clam @entity204 have been named after the research vessel @entity207 while the clam @entity205 has been named after mollusc expert @entity208			2
the marine worm has not yet been named and is currently being examined at the @entity146 .			2

a large sea snail , two kinds of clam and a marine worm were found during @entity14 surveys around the @entity16 plateau in the @entity17
researchers say existence of clams and worm at single site could indicate presence of a cold seep , where hydrocarbons are released from sea bed
