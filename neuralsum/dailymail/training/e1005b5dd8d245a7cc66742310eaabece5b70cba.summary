by @entity0 a popularly held belief this summer is that @entity2 are in the midst of what has become known as ‘ doing a @entity5 ’			1
anybody not affiliated with the club seems to be in agreement that spending so much on so many players is going to end badly			0
there is basis for this argument but @entity2 ’s situation is very different this summer			2
the comparisons , of course , stem from the fact that both clubs sold their best players for a handsome sum and went on something of a ‘ spree ’			0
from as early as the end of last season , it was clear that @entity24 , @entity26 and @entity47 were already targets			1
in the cases of @entity24 and @entity26 , @entity2 have signed two experienced @entity51 players , with great track records and , while this is not a guarantee of success it makes that ‘ bedding in ’ period all the more easy			1
not only this , but @entity26 is a low - risk signing given his experience and small fee , whilst @entity24 – who may miss the first couple of fixtures with a knee injury - was in the @entity51 team of the year , so you ca n’t really ask for more of an indication of a ‘ good buy ’			2
signed : @entity2 completed a deal to sign young @entity72 frontman @entity71 on tuesday and while @entity74 only has one season of @entity51 experience , he adapted very well to its rigours , and played in the @entity78 for previous clubs @entity80 and @entity81			1
many may see £ 20 million as a lot for @entity74 , given he ’s had just one season in the @entity51 but you ’re unlikely to get a top international defender for less these days and again , his experience in the @entity51 means there will be little - to - no transition period			0
as for @entity90 and @entity91 , both are still unknown quantities but they are as much ‘ for the future ’ as they are first - team guarantees and all indications from pre-season are that both will grow to become superb players			0
all smiles : @entity74 joined @entity2 in a £ 20million move from @entity25 earlier this month the transfer of @entity103 obviously fell through amid suggestions the @entity105 failed a medical , which was a shame as he would have been snip at £ 8.5million			1
so , the @entity108 will continue looking elsewhere for a striker replacement for @entity30 , while at the same time @entity110 could still leave for @entity112 in a whopping £ 14million deal			0
all things considered , @entity2 ’s business has so far been positive			0
no signings have yet got fans salivating with excitement , but should @entity22 follow through on some of the reported interest in the likes of @entity121 , @entity122 or @entity123 , then this could go down as @entity2 ’s most fruitful summer in over a decade			1
plan of action : @entity2 boss @entity22 may still bring a huge name to @entity127 this transfer window			2

@entity2 are in the midst of ' doing a @entity5 ' according to some fans following the £ *75million* departure of @entity30 to @entity31
reds have bought @entity74 , @entity91 and @entity71 since frontman left @entity127
@entity24 , @entity26 and @entity47 have also joined @entity2
@entity5 went on ' spending spree ' last summer following £ 86million sale of @entity33 to @entity34
however , many of club 's new signings impressed last term
