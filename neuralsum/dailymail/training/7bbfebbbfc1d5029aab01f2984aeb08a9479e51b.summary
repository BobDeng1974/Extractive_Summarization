her fur may be a little matted and her whiskers somewhat scruffy , but when you ’re 115 you can be forgiven for letting yourself go just a bit			0
after turning 24 earlier this year – and hitting 115 in cat years this month – @entity6 is now laying claim to the title of the world ’s oldest cat			1
but she has a potential catfight on her paws from other felines lining up to claim the distinction			0
@entity15 , 74 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , said @entity6 the cat was born in march 1990 the previous record holder , @entity20 from @entity21 , who was born a month earlier , died in june now mr @entity15 has to get @entity6 recognised officially by @entity23 before it becomes official @entity6 ’s owner @entity15 , 74 , says she was born in march 1990 – one month after the previous record holder , @entity20 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , who died in june			1
mr @entity15 , from @entity16 , @entity17 , adopted @entity6 from a neighbour as a kitten – and it seems she is just as playful today as she was then			1
‘ @entity6 has got brilliant , bright eyes and her claws are sharp as anything , ’ he said			0
‘ she still catches birds , frogs and hedgehogs			0
she ’s kept her hearing and sight			0
’ @entity6 now needs to be recognised by @entity23 to be named the world ’s oldest living cat , meaning mr @entity15 would have to provide documentation to support his claim			1
yesterday @entity42 and @entity43 , of @entity44 , @entity45 , came forward with @entity46 , a female tortoiseshell , who they say was born in january 1989 – making her 14 months older than @entity6			2
however , the couple admitted they have no record to prove her age			0
olive the cat is 24 , or 115 in cat years - which is worked out along the lines of a complicated formula in july , @entity60 the tabby , from @entity58 in @entity59 , emerged as a contender aged 28 , or 129 cat years			1
@entity63 and @entity64 said they had proof she was born in july 1986 but had n’t yet got in touch with @entity23 with @entity60 ’s certificates			1
all the cats have a few years to go if they are to catch up with @entity70 from @entity71 , @entity72 , who lived for an astonishing 38 years and three days before her death in august 2005			0
the formula for calculating cat years equates the first two years of life to 25 human years			2
then each additional year counts as four cat years .			2

olive the cat was born in march 1990 - making her the world *'s* oldest *moggie*
owner @entity15 , 74 , has to *submit* proof to @entity23
the previous oldest cat , @entity20 , from @entity25 , died in june
