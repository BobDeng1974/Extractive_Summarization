@entity0 scored the 300th goal of his @entity3 career to become the third player in the club 's history to reach the landmark alongside @entity8 and @entity9			1
the @entity10 forward netted against @entity11 in the 68th minute to move @entity3 within four points of their great rivals @entity13 , letting out his frustration following an unfair booking for a dive which could see the three - time @entity19 winner suspended for saturday 's @entity21 game with @entity22			1
yet @entity0 joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances by doing what all forwards should , sending a header downwards and beating goalkeeper @entity28 , before celebrating with @entity29 and his team - mates			1
@entity0 scored the 300th goal of his @entity3 career to see off @entity11 and remain four points behind @entity13 @entity0 joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances with this header against @entity11 on wednesday night @entity0 turns to his trademark celebration after scoring the 300th goal of his @entity3 career the @entity10 forward netted in the 68th minute to move @entity3 within four points of their great rivals @entity0 celebrates with @entity3 team - mate @entity29 after opening the scoring for the @entity38 club @entity0 is swamped by his @entity3 team - mates after scoring the opening goal of the night @entity11 : @entity28 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 subs : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 goals : none booked : @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity52 , @entity42 @entity3 : @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity0 , @entity69 , @entity29 subs : @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity44 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 goals : @entity0 ( 68 ) , @entity78 ( 73 ) booked : @entity78 , @entity0 , @entity66 , @entity29 , @entity62 not only that , the former @entity80 great has scored 99 goals under manager @entity82 in just 89 games , following his five against @entity84 three days ago			1
his latest puts the 30 - year - old just seven goals behind @entity8 's record of 307 in 396 outings , and 23 shy of @entity9 's 323 in 741 — with plenty of time to surpass both @entity88 legends			1
up until his opening goal 22 minutes from time , however , it long looked like @entity82 would be left as deflated as the balloons that @entity0 took a disliking to in the first half			2
@entity0 had given four orange balloons that invaded the pitch at the @entity99 a kicking as his team failed to dominate against a team with little left to play for in mid-table			0
@entity11 in no way had their flip flops on , and fancied giving the winners of @entity109 a run for their money			0
they did just that , proving far more difficult than the @entity84 side beaten 9 - 1 on sunday			0
yet @entity3 's rotten luck was epitomised by @entity0 's yellow card in the 52nd minute , received for diving inside the 18 - yard box with the game at 0 - 0			1
he had beaten the offside trap , before cutting inside to shoot , only for defender @entity42 to chop him down			0
replays were not needed to show it was a wrong decision from referee @entity123 to book @entity0 for diving			2
from every angle , there was no question it should have been a penalty , and @entity82 will appeal the caution in a bid to have his one - game ban rescinded			2
' i told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty , ' @entity82 said afterwards			0
' i told him it was incredible that he did n't award a penalty and that he showed @entity0 the yellow card			1
' the booking lit something in the stomachs of the @entity3 players , as @entity66 , @entity29 and @entity62 were cautioned for dissent less than three minutes later before they broke the deadlock soon after			0
@entity0 gave four orange balloons a kicking in the first half on what was shaping up to be a frustrating evening for @entity0 @entity0 was having a frustrating evening until he scored his 300th of the career for @entity3 300 - goals 288 - appearances 206 - right footed 52 - left footed 41 - headers 55 - penalties 77 - assists on 68 minutes , @entity62 got his own back			1
the @entity154 right - back escaped his marker down the wing before crossing for @entity0 to head home his 300th goal for @entity3			1
an easy way to reach a milestone			0
@entity0 , in celebration , gestured towards the linesman who robbed him of the penalty and , from then on , the win never looked in doubt			0
it was @entity78 who put daylight between the teams just five minutes later			0
the @entity170 international 's controlled shot found the bottom - left corner , and effectively killed the game off to ensure @entity3 would not be left six points adrift of @entity13			2
@entity82 added : ' we tried to pressure them with more intensity high up the pitch but in the first half we were not convincing			0
in the second , we were more complete , we played well and we deserved to win			0
' they will have to repeat the trick on saturday against @entity22 to remain within touching distance of @entity13 , but are set to be without the suspended @entity0			2
the man @entity3 paid £ 80million for in 2009 continued his protests with the officials after the full - time whistle , but it seems he will have to wait patiently to chase down @entity8 and @entity9			2
@entity3 's rotten luck was epitomised by @entity0 's yellow card from referee @entity123 for this so - called dive @entity0 could n't believe it as he was not awarded a penalty and was booked afterwards for diving @entity0 complains during the match as it was not going his way until his goal in the second half @entity78 doubled @entity3 's lead on wednesday to ensure the win for the @entity38 giants			1

@entity0 scored the 300th goal of his @entity3 career
the @entity206 did it in just 288 appearances for the @entity38 club
@entity0 is chasing down @entity8 's 307 and @entity9 's 323 totals for @entity3
@entity78 doubled their lead as @entity3 beat @entity11 2 - 0 in @entity21
@entity13 sit top of the table but second - placed @entity3 cut the gap to four points
@entity82 plans to appeal @entity0 's ' incredible ' yellow card for diving
