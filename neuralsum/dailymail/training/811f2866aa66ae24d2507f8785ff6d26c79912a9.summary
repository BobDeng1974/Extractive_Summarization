by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 06:57 est , 28 october 2013 incredible images of the @entity3 have emerged following @entity5 ’s slingshot manoeuvre around the planet			1
@entity5 flew past @entity3 at 78,000 mph two weeks ago - enough momentum to cruise past the asteroid belt to @entity10 , where it should arrive in 2016			1
when it arrives , the $ 1.1 billion spacecraft will use nine instruments to probe deep inside @entity10 and reveal glimpses into the planet 's origin			2
the false - blue has been added to reflect a view provided by a near - infrared filter that is typically used to detect methane the probe was able to send an early image of @entity3 following the launch despite unexpectedly going into ‘ safe mode ’			0
while @entity31 is now pulling together the raw data sent back from the probe , amateur image processers have also had a go at filling in the gaps			0
@entity18 has been working with colleague , @entity19 , to assemble the latest raw imagery from the @entity5 to produce false - colour portraits of @entity3			1
the images show half of @entity3 's disk , including the coast of @entity40 and clouds over the @entity42			1
the images show half of @entity3 's disk , including the coast of @entity40 and clouds over the @entity42 the @entity5 mission will use nine instruments to probe inside @entity10 and reveal glimpses into the planet 's origin @entity5 is a @entity50 mission to the planet @entity10			1
the probe cost $ 1.1 billion and was launched in 2011			0
the windmill - shaped spacecraft travels at 78,000 mph			0
it has nine instruments to investigate @entity10 ’s gravity field , magnetic field , and polar magnetosphere			2
@entity5 will also search for clues about how @entity10 formed , including whether the planet has a rocky core			1
it will also study @entity10 's deep winds , which can reach speeds of 384 mph			2
the spacecraft 's name comes from @entity66			0
the god @entity10 drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief , but his wife , the goddess @entity5 , was able to peer through the clouds and see @entity10 's true nature			1
the false - color blue has been added to show a view provided by a near - infrared filter that is often used to detect methane ‘ the raw images are transmitted from @entity5 in strips - like a push broom , ’ @entity18 told @entity78			1
‘ the matchups are n’t always perfect because the @entity5 spacecraft is constantly rotating and moving			0
’ but according to @entity18 , that inconsistency is what makes these images so fascinating with the @entity3 ’s surface changing as the spacecraft flies over the planet			2
‘ it ’s rare to get such views since only a few spacecraft have flown by @entity3 in this manner on there way to distant destinations , ’ said @entity18			0
these are expected to be among the last of planetary images from @entity5 until it arrives at @entity10 in 2016			1
here it will take the first ever images of the gas giant ’s north and south poles			0
launched in 2011 , @entity5 flew beyond the orbit of @entity105 , @entity3 's closest planetary neighbour , before looping back toward our home planet for a quick visit			2
this reconstructed image of @entity3 is one of the first snapshots transmitted back home by the @entity5 spacecraft by space mission standards , @entity5 's @entity3 rendezvous was low - key compared with the @entity117 's nail - biting landing on @entity105 last year , which drew crowds			0
like @entity5 , previous missions to the outer solar system have used @entity3 as a gravity slingshot since there 's no rocket powerful enough to make a direct flight			0
the @entity128 spacecraft buzzed by @entity3 twice in the 1990s en route to @entity10 , the solar system 's largest planet located 484 million miles from the sun. @entity5 's trajectory has carried it beyond the orbit of @entity105 and then back into the inner solar system where it did a velocity boosting @entity3 flyby to weeks ago to gain the energy needed to reach @entity10			1

@entity18 and @entity19 have assembled the latest raw imagery
they show the coast of @entity40 and clouds over the @entity42
these are expected to be the last of the planetary images from @entity5 until it arrives at @entity10 in 2016
