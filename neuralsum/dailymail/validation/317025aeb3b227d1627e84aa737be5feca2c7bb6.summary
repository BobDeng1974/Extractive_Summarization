history man @entity0 has spoken of his pride as he ended a six - year international scoring drought to become the first @entity4 player to net a hat - trick since 1969			1
the @entity7 striker hit his treble in the 6 - 1 triumph over @entity10 , with two @entity12 penalties and a @entity14 strike also helping @entity15 recover from the shock of @entity18 ’s first - half equaliser for the @entity20 minnows			1
not since @entity21 bagged four against @entity22 in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side			2
@entity0 celebrates after scoring the second of his three goals against @entity10 on sunday @entity0 ( right ) curls the ball around the @entity10 defence to net his third goal of the game at @entity15 regardless of the weak opposition in the @entity37 qualifier - albeit the @entity34 fell victim to the visitors ’ first - ever competitive goal to make it 1 - 1 - @entity0 admitted he was thrilled to have achieved a feat that eluded even the great @entity40			1
‘ i got asked after the @entity42 game if i could get a hat - trick and i laughed it off , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i said i would be happy with one goal as i have n’t scored for a while			2
so to get the hat - trick was really pleasing			1
@entity10 goalkeeper @entity48 dives to his right but is unable to stop the ball hitting the back of the net @entity53 is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against minnows @entity10 ‘ i ’ve been told that it was 46 years since the last @entity4 hat - trick and i was shocked			1
‘ i thought @entity40 would have managed it so i am very happy and proud to be part of history			0
‘ it means a lot			0
it ’s really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career			0
‘ i ’ve got the match ball and i ’ll probably put it in a little glass cabinet			0
i have another one from my @entity70 days when i scored a hat - trick against @entity72 , so i will put it next to that			1
that was my last hat - trick so it will go beside that one			1
’ @entity0 had last scored for @entity4 against @entity75 in 2009 , and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19 - month international exile in 2011			1
the 28 - year - old gave thanks to @entity81 for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the @entity37 campaign , which continues with a crunch trip to @entity86 in june			2
@entity0 was recently mocked on @entity87 for buying a @entity88 after inconsistent form for his club @entity4 boss @entity81 admitted he is upbeat at his side 's position in @entity20 after their win ‘ it ’s been a while since i scored for @entity4 and i was aware of that			1
i get told every day , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s good to get off the mark again , especially after being out for a long time			0
was it getting to me ? not really			0
i was still confident going in to games			0
‘ to be honest i have n’t had many chances in games but i had a lot against @entity10			1
i could have scored more than three but i was just happy to get the goals			2
‘ getting the hat - trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer			1
hopefully i have done enough to stay in the gaffer ’s plans and i ’m looking forward to it			2
‘ the manager likes my link - up play			0
i know people have been saying i have n’t scored but i ’ve been doing other parts			0
‘ he ’s praised me for that and if i can keep doing that , and add goals , then i ’ll be happy			0
‘ he ’s been a massive support to me			0
he ’s been great with me since i came back into the @entity4 squad and i owe a lot to him			2
