we all need a tonic in winter			2
@entity2 has come in the form of a weekly virtual visit to @entity5 now that the new series of @entity8 ’s @entity7 has begun : sunshine , sandy beaches and the handsome @entity11			1
but it ’s also a reminder of a glorious week when i actually went to @entity5 - where the programme is shot - and saw this lovely island that combines the best of @entity18 with a typically @entity20 laid - back attitude			1
a @entity20 classic : @entity5 has a sleepy feel , and brings a touch of @entity18 flair to the region it comprises the tiny islands of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 and the main island , a butterfly - shaped landmass with two very different halves			1
@entity35 , to the east , is more developed , with clusters of small beach towns and long curves of powdery white sand			2
the other half , @entity41 , is wilder , with flora and fauna - filled national parks , rugged black and surf - dashed beaches			1
i based myself here at the @entity46			2
as did the @entity7 crew , it turned out - something i discovered when i spotted @entity11 and @entity50 taking a shower together ( i should point out that the shower in question was on the beach and that the two actors had just been for a swim )			1
this is not your typical tourist @entity20 island			1
it is one yet to be discovered by the wider world , although visitor numbers have been increasing since the first series of the show			2
one day , i headed for the lush slopes of the @entity68 volcano			0
the hike to its blackened summit took 90 minutes , and the trail was littered with car - sized boulders			1
a boost in profile : @entity5 is the tropical setting for the enjoyable @entity8 series @entity7 as i neared the peak , the colour of the moss - covered rocks changed from green to a sulphurous yellow and squeaking bats dive - bombed me as i scrambled past their cave			1
reaching the top was like arriving on another planet , with mutant - like patches of impossibly bright green grass and steep slopes of smoking rock falling away into the seemingly bottomless caldera			1
on the way home , i spotted a man pressing sugar cane by the roadside , and stopped to watch him push the thick stalks of vegetation through the rollers			0
the gloopy yellow juice drained into a container , and he offered me a swig			0
it was good , though i could almost feel my teeth rotting			0
i spent my days on @entity28 impersonating @entity104 , wandering along deserted beaches , eating fresh fish at bamboo - thatched restaurants and exploring the remains of crumbling windmills			1
a hideaway on the edge of the surf : the little coastal village of @entity114 sums up the island 's appeal back on the mainland , i discovered a reminder of the island ’s dark past in the seaside village of @entity122			1
@entity124 des @entity123 is a pathway connecting the harbour with the building where slaves would be taken for sale after arriving from @entity130			0
there ’s a stone staircase engraved with the names of the countries they came from , and a notch in the wall where slave masters hung their whips			0
i truly hope @entity5 does n’t change			0
despite its growing popularity , it has just one chain hotel - @entity35 ’s @entity143 in the city of @entity145 - and the @entity46 is @entity41 ’s largest and most luxurious place to stay			1
fans might recognise the main art deco - style building from the show , but guests in the know opt for the beach hut - style bungalows dotted along the private beach			2
a place to sleep soundly : @entity157 stayed at @entity158 's @entity143 this is where i had my first encounter with a fellow @entity162 , who turned out to be @entity163 , aka officer @entity164 from the series			2
i asked him if he ’s enjoying his summer in paradise and he smiled			0
‘ what ’s not to love about this place ? ’ i ’m inclined to agree			0
seven nights at @entity35 ’s @entity143 ( 08454 212 608 , www.clubmed.co.uk ) costs £ 1,296 per adult and £ 834 per child , excluding flights			0
children under six stay free			0
double rooms at @entity41 ’s @entity46 ( 00590 590 68 7670 , www.fortroyal.eu ) from £ 91 per night			0
@entity175 ( 0207 660 0337 , www.airfrance.co.uk ) flies from @entity176 to @entity177 , @entity5 , from £ 879 return .			0

@entity180 merges the best bits of @entity18 and the @entity20
it remains one of the @entity20 's less - known - and most *beautiful* - islands
the island is currently the setting for the @entity8 drama @entity7
