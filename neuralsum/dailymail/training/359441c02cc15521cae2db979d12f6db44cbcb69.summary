@entity0 was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar mps from policing their own affairs and sack minister @entity5 @entity0 was last night facing a chorus of demands to bar mps from policing their own affairs and sack minister @entity5			1
senior figures from all main parties backed a call from the watchdog in charge of @entity14 expenses for mps to be prevented from ‘ marking their own homework ’ when complaints are made			2
former @entity19 chairman @entity18 and a grassroots party organisation said mrs @entity5 , who was made to repay £ 5,800 in excess mortgage claims last week , should resign or be dismissed			1
anger over the @entity25 ’s case has been compounded by the decision of the standards committee , made up of ten mps and three lay members with no voting rights , to water down her punishment			1
@entity32 , the independent parliamentary standards commissioner , initially suggested she should repay some £ 44,000 and said her designation of what had been her main home was incorrect			1
no 10 said that @entity37 , who once suggested @entity28 ’ expenses should meet a ‘ smell test ’ even if they were strictly within the rules , was not backing reform of the standards committee			1
a spokesman said : ‘ he is happy with the system as it stands			2
’ but sir @entity47 , chairman of the @entity48 , said the commons must ‘ give away powers in regulating itself ’ , insisting : ‘ mps marking their own homework always ends in scandal			2
’ work and pensions secretary @entity55 said he was ‘ very open ’ to ‘ independent people ’ being in charge of the process , saying : ‘ this goes on and on and on , eating away at the credibility of @entity61			2
whatever it takes to restore that credibility is vital			2
’ @entity64 , @entity65 ’s shadow leader of the @entity14 , said : ‘ we need a system which commands public confidence , and what we have at the moment clearly does n’t do that			2
’ @entity74 , the @entity65 mp whose complaint prompted the investigation into @entity76 , said : ‘ everyone who was in the last parliament was embroiled one way or other in the expenses scandal and therefore they ca n’t possibly sit in judgment on other @entity28			0
’ the former anti-sleaze mp for @entity84 , @entity85 , told the @entity88 ’s @entity87 programme that he agreed the committee on standards should be abolished			1
he said : ‘ @entity91 ... is incapable of regulating itself and that ’s been proven yet again			0
’ the investigation into mrs @entity5 was prompted after she claimed £ 90,000 in mortgage interest and other housing costs for her taxpayer - funded second home in @entity98 , south - west @entity99 , which was also home to her parents			1
she rented a smaller property in @entity103 which she designated as her main home			0
the central allegation against her – that she cheated taxpayers in order to subsidise the living costs of relatives – was dismissed			2
but during the course of the investigation , it emerged that she had increased the size of her mortgage at least twice since becoming an mp and made a series of ‘ overclaims ’ which she blamed on administrative errors			0
correspondence released by the committee reveals she made repeated attempts to browbeat the commissioner into dropping inquiries into the broader question of her mortgage charges			2
mrs @entity5 won only lukewarm support from colleagues after issuing a curt 30 - second apology in the @entity14 last week , and some ministers privately indicate they believe she should have offered to resign			1
@entity18 said : ‘ having staked his authority and reputation on defending his culture secretary against calls for her to be fired , the prime minister will be damned if he now fires her and damned if he does n’t			1
the best way out of this is for @entity76 to resign			2
’ @entity136 , director of @entity138 , called for her to ‘ go with immediate effect ’			0
he said : ‘ @entity5 is a totemic example of the modern political class who hold no discernible character , talent or integrity			1
‘ the grassroots of the @entity19 have no time for careerist politicians who not only do not support , but flagrantly oppose , conservative values once they are comfortably settled in @entity61 and @entity149			0
the longer she remains in her position the greater the damage			0
’ @entity152 , former head of the @entity153 , said : ‘ in a company environment , in a business environment , you ’d be asking for a resignation			0
’ commenting on suggestions that mr @entity37 wanted to keep mrs @entity5 on because he did not want to lose one of only four women in his @entity149 , lord @entity152 told @entity161 5 ’s @entity162 : ‘ i think it ’s an absolute legitimate motive to say “ i need more women in my @entity149 ”			1
but i ’m sure he could have found another one , if you know what i mean			0
’ @entity5 ’s allies yesterday claimed she was being treated more harshly by @entity19 supporters and the @entity171 because she had been in charge of controversial reforms on media regulation and gay marriage			1
@entity55 said : ‘ i think she has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the @entity180 , which has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her , i know , and also the gay marriage stuff			0
’ the @entity185 told the @entity88 ’s @entity187 show : ‘ there ’s a lot of conservatives out there who perhaps were n’t necessarily in support of it all so feel rather bitter about that			0
’ mp @entity74 , who made the original complaint about her expenses , said the suggestion she was being demonised because of her policy responsibilities was ‘ absurd ’			0
he added : ‘ it ’s desperate stuff and it ’s wholly inaccurate			0
if that ’s the best they can do it shows the problems they are in			0
’ a @entity209 poll for the @entity210 found almost three - quarters of voters thought mrs @entity5 ’s apology was inadequate , and similar numbers felt mr @entity37 was wrong to offer her his support			1
some 78 per cent thought she should lose her @entity149 seat			0
former @entity19 culture secretary @entity216 said : ‘ i do n’t think it matters if she resigns or not			0
bless her heart , she wo n’t be missed if she goes and she wo n’t be noticed if she stays			0
‘ what this is all about is , first of all , the judgment of @entity37 ; secondly the integrity of @entity61			1
‘ i mean , the 30 - second apology to the @entity91 , allowing a bunch of dim - witted backbenchers to roll her out of what an independent adjudicator had said			1
who is behind this ? @entity37 needs to take a long , hard look about what kind of administration he ’s trying to run			1

@entity18 said mrs @entity5 should resign or be dismissed
mrs @entity5 issued a curt 30 - second apology in the commons last week
it was initially suggested that she should repay some £ 44,000
no 10 said @entity37 was not backing reform of standards committee
