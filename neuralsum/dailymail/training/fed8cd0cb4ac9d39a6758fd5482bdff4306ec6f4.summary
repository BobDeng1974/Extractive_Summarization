by @entity1 reporter a widow whose husband 's death in 2012 was wrongly deemed a suicide has spoken out about her battle to have the decision overturned			1
investigations by the @entity11 police and the area medical examiner concluded that the death of @entity14 , @entity15 's husband , was an accident			1
however , the @entity18 @entity17 ruled that the death was a suicide and dismissed @entity15 's requests to overturn the decision			1
moving forward : @entity15 with her son , @entity24 , and twin daughters , @entity26 , left , and @entity27			0
@entity15 's husband , @entity28 , died in a firearm accident in @entity18 that was wrongly ruled a suicide by the state medical examiners office according to the @entity33 , @entity14 traveled from the family 's home in @entity36 to @entity37 , @entity18 on january 13 , 2012 , to visit an old friend , @entity38			1
accidental : @entity15 says her husband was in one of the happiest periods of his life and devoted to their three children before he died as he and @entity38 caught up , @entity46 , a friend of @entity38 's , arrived with two handguns			2
@entity38 was considering purchasing a firearm and @entity46 was helping to advise him on what type would be appropriate			0
according to court records , @entity46 removed the magazine from a @entity53 handgun and dry - fired it before putting the magazine back in and placing it on a counter			0
according to @entity46 , @entity15 then picked up the weapon and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger			2
@entity46 says he then removed it from his mouth and pulled the slide back before replacing it in his mouth			0
what happened next , a judge eventually ruled , was not suicide but ' consistent with [ @entity15 's ] personality as a prankster			0
' @entity15 put the now - armed gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger			1
homicide detectives concluded that the death an accident , and that alcohol and @entity14 's ' unfamiliarity with firearms ' and alcohol played a part , reports the @entity33			0
a local medical examiner , dr @entity78 , came to the same conclusion			2
however , dr @entity80 , an associate chief medical examiner , concluded that @entity82 's death was a suicide and he and dr @entity84 , the state 's chief medical examiner , refused @entity15 's pleas to examine the case more closely			1
she was not content to let sleeping dogs lie			0
at stake was $ 1.2 million in insurance payments , money she desperately needed to raise her children , and more importantly , her children 's knowledge that their father did not intend to kill himself			2
prankster : a judge ruled that @entity14 could n't have known the gun was loaded when he put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger devoted : @entity15 wanted her children to know that their father never intended to leave them ' i needed to find the answers for my children and be able to tell them without any doubt that their dad did not leave them on purpose , ' @entity15 told the @entity33			1
after a three - day hearing , a judge ruled that @entity82 's death was accidental			1
he found that not only did @entity80 come to his conclusion without taking into account the conclusinos of the sheriff 's office or the local medical examiner			1
he also relied on an incorrect definition of suicide , which does n't take into account whether or not the victim intended to kill themselves or not			0
tragic loss : @entity15 and @entity82 were parents to a young son and two baby twin girls when he died in the horrific accident the judge criticized @entity80 because he ' failed to investigate and scrutinize all the evidence available , ' which brought him to the wrong conclusion			2
@entity15 had been awarded $ 300,000 in insurance following her husband 's death			1
she was unaware that when the death was ruled an accident , she was entitled to a much larger sum			0
now , she says , she can stay at home with her twin little girls until they start school as she and @entity82 had planned			0
the @entity33 contacted @entity80 for comment , but he refused to be interviewed , saying only , ' based on my investigation , and even considering the subsequent administrative hearing , my opinion about the manner of death remains unchanged			0

@entity15 had to fight in a @entity18 court to get the suicide ruling in her husband 's death overturned
police and a local medical examiner concluded that @entity82 's death was accident
yet a state medical examiner deemed it was a suicide
@entity82 , *39* , put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger in january 2012
witnesses said it was *unclear* if @entity82 knew the gun was loaded
a judge overruled the state medical examiner 's determination , and said he had not examined all evidence and used a faulty definition of suicide
@entity15 was entitled to $ *1.5* million in insurance for the death of her husband
more importantly , she says , is that her children know their dad never meant to leave them
