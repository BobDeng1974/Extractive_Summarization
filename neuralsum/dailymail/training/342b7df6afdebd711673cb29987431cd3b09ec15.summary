how do you keep track of your cat ’s health and well - being even when not at home ? this £ 65 smart cat scale claims to be the answer , providing alerts on what your pet has been up to and monitoring their health , weight and waste			1
and the device will also be used to see if it ’s true that cats can detect oncoming earthquakes			0
called tailio the internet - enabled scale is placed under a regular box			1
it then sends information on a cat 's habits to a smartphone app. it can monitor the health and weight of a cat and provides alerts called @entity35 , the device was developed by company @entity36 in @entity20 , @entity37 and has already reached its funding goal on @entity39			1
it is placed under a regular cat litter box and , when a cat climbs in to do their business , it tracks the weight of the cat and its time in the box			1
and it ’s sensitive enough to measure the change in weight of the cat and box when the animal climbs in and out			2
the belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters – and even the weather - has been around for centuries			1
in 373 @entity61 , historians recorded that animals , including rats , snakes and weasels , deserted the @entity67 city of @entity68 in droves just days before a quake devastated the place			0
accounts of similar animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the centuries since , such as catfish moving violently , chickens that stop laying eggs and bees leaving their hive in a panic			0
precisely what animals sense is a mystery , but one theory is that wild and domestic creatures feel the @entity88 vibrate before humans			0
other ideas suggest they detect electrical changes in the air or gas released from the @entity88			0
in march 2012 , fishermen in @entity95 reported a sharp increase in oarfish sightings following the massive magnitude - 8.8 earthquake in @entity100 that same month , which marked almost exactly one year before the country was devastated by its own magnitude - 8.9 quake in northeast @entity95			0
the device syncs with a smartphone app on @entity106 and @entity107 so that , when out and about , owners can see what their cat has been up to			1
it can also monitor multiple cats and provide information on how often each one is visiting the litter box			1
if it notices irregularities in a cat ’s behaviour it can share information with a vet to diagnose and treat the cat			0
‘ @entity35 will alert you if they have n't shown up to the litter box in their usual routine , so you can see what may be needed , ’ the company writes			2
@entity35 will also show trends over time to see if any pre-set weight loss goals are being met			0
perhaps most interestingly , though , the company will use @entity35 to see if cats have a ‘ sixth sense ’ when it comes to the natural world			2
‘ for instance , since ancient times many people have believed cats can somehow sense impending earthquakes hours or even days in advance , ’ they write			2
@entity35 has been awarded a grant by the @entity141 to in particular monitor the behaviour of cats along southern @entity37 fault lines			2
the team will look for clues to see if there is a correlation between changes in animal behaviour and seismic activity			0
the company is taking pre-orders for @entity35 now , and expects to begin shipping in april 2015			0
the belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters - and even the weather - has been around for centuries , and @entity35 will also be used to see if cats can predict earthquakes			1
the team has a grant from the @entity141 to see if the pets have an ability to sense natural disasters the device is @entity168 enabled so that all of its data can be synced			1
it is also easy to clean and has a splash resistant surface , while the non-slip mat ensures the litter box will not slide of the scale when the cat climbs in to do its business			1

@entity20 - based company has designed a smart litter box for cats
