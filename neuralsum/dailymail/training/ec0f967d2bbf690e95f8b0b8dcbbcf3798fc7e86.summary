by @entity0 a village has unveiled a new bus shelter - despite having no bus services there for the past six years			1
the smart new concrete structure was specially built for the people of @entity7 , @entity8 for free by a generous local construction firm			1
however anyone who uses it faces a long wait as the last bus stopped in the village in 2008			1
@entity16 residents hope the new shelter will be a sign that their old service could one day be restored			2
the @entity8 village of @entity7 , near @entity21 , has been given a new bus shelter despite having no bus service @entity24 , the production manager at @entity25 , said that his company was just doing its bit for the local community			1
he said : ‘ the old bus shelter was falling down and we thought it was starting to become a bit of a hazard			2
‘ we approached the council and asked if we could provide a new one for nothing			0
‘ they agreed but said it would have to be similar to the old one , so we made one the same size but carved the word @entity7 into the front of it			2
‘ there ’s no real focal point to the village when people come here , so we thought this would mark it out			0
‘ we are aware there are no buses coming here at the moment but we ’d like to hope that the new shelter might encourage them to come back			0
‘ it would certainly help us if they did , as it would help our employees to get to work more easily if there was a bus service			0
’ villagers launched a @entity61 campaign last year begging bus companies to divert the region ’s services so they stop in @entity7 - but their pleas have so far gone unanswered			1
local resident @entity66 said : ‘ it ’s nice that @entity25 have done it out of goodwill and it ’s nice the way that they have done it			0
‘ but it seems quite ironic that we have this new shelter but no bus services			0

local firm generously *replaced* ' *shabby* ' shelter for @entity7 , @entity8
there has not been a bus stopping there since 2008
locals have started @entity61 page begging bus company to *reroute* service to their village near @entity21
