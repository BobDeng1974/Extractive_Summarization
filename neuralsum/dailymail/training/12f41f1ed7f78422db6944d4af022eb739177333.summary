forty years may have passed , but there is one topic that remains off - limits for @entity3 when discussing @entity5 derbies			1
law may be 74 , but he is as sharp and engaging as ever in discussion			0
at a sponsor 's event inside @entity15 earlier this week , not far from where his statue stands outside the famous stadium , the conversation flows with the @entity17 hero until the subject of his controversial goal in the 1974 @entity5 derby is raised			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity3 believes @entity22 and @entity23 are two of the world 's best strikers @entity22 ( centre ) will return to @entity17 's starting line - up after serving his three - match ban ' i ca n't remember it			1
i just ca n't remember it , ' @entity3 says , bluntly			2
whether time has erased any memory of the goal or @entity3 is just being evasive , the @entity32 does not want to talk about it - and it is easy to see why			2
united fans labelled @entity6 ' @entity39 of @entity15 ' after scoring 237 goals , but on april 27 , 1974 he was booed off by the home crowd at that famous ground after scoring against his former team for @entity44			2
in what was the penultimate game of a nightmare season for @entity17 , the then 34 - year - old backheeled @entity49 's square pass beyond @entity50 to hand @entity44 a 1 - 0 win			2
@entity17 needed a win to keep their hopes of survival alive			2
other results meant they would have gone down anyway - but in the eyes of the home fans , the @entity39 had relegated his old club			0
@entity3 did not celebrate and was immediately substituted			0
law may have tried to forget it , but on sunday when @entity63 's @entity17 head to the @entity64 , the former striker will be made aware of the goal again by the fans in blue			1
' occasionally @entity44 fans try to remind me of it , ' @entity3 said with a wry smile			0
@entity3 's back - heel finish , while playing for @entity44 against @entity17 , condemned the @entity73 to their fate law was mobbed by @entity44 fans after he scored against @entity17 which resulted in his former side 's relegation law ( centre ) formed a formidable partnership with @entity81 ( left ) and sir @entity82 ( right ) - the trio are thought of so highly at @entity17 that the @entity84 have a statue at @entity15 law made his name at @entity17 as part of a @entity84 which included three of the best players ever to grace the @entity15 turf			1
sir @entity82 and @entity81 , who both used to describe @entity3 's play as ' electric ' , completed the three - pronged attack			2
@entity17 's modern - day equivalent comprises @entity23 , @entity93 and @entity22			1
@entity22 has been missing for the last three games through suspension , so @entity3 is delighted the 29 - year - old captain will return for sunday 's game			1
' it 's an incredible boost to have @entity22 back , ' @entity3 added			1
' he and @entity99 are two of the best strikers in the world really			0
i would love to play with them			0
' as far as compliments go , that is probably as good as any @entity17 player will get			0
law has been a fan of @entity22 since he signed for @entity17 a decade ago			1
the @entity32 has watched the @entity110 captain inch closer and closer to his tally of 237 goals for the club			0
@entity22 is now just 18 short of @entity3 , who is second in the all - time scorers list behind the 249 - goal sir @entity82			1
law is convinced @entity22 will surpass his total this season and then go on to reach @entity82 's landmark			1
' i am sure he can ( pass my total ) it this season , ' @entity3 said			0
' and stay away from injuries he will be the highest scorer in @entity17 's history			2
' @entity17 are confident of victory having watched their opponents across town go three matches without a win			0
@entity22 will be @entity17 's highest scorer if he stays away from injuries , says law law believes @entity63 's side are starting to find some form after their topsy - turvy start to the season @entity136 's men also snatched a creditable draw against the all - conquering @entity138 last weekend , but @entity6 does not think that necessarily means the visitors will come away with anything on sunday			1
' @entity17 played well and got a good result against @entity138 , but the derby game is another game altogether , ' he added			0
' @entity146 games could go any way			0
it 's not always the best team who wins the game			0
' that said , @entity3 thinks @entity17 are heading in the right direction under @entity136 , who has won just three of his eight matches in charge			1
' i feel momentum is building , ' @entity3 said			1
' it 's always a bit difficult when a new manager comes in , you have to get to know the players			0
' it 's very rare that you would settle in straight away			0
once he gets what he wants as a team and the way it plays you will see the rewards and it will get better and better , guaranteed			0
' law hopes @entity136 can provide him with a derby result he will want to remember rather than forget on sunday			2
@entity3 was speaking at the unveiling of the ' @entity176 ' and customised @entity178 squad watches by @entity179 , @entity17 's official timekeeping partner .			1

@entity3 is glad @entity22 is fit for sunday 's @entity182
@entity6 believes @entity63 's side are building momentum
law stated he could not remember scoring the goal that sent @entity17 down
