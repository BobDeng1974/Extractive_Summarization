a tiny sea creature that was found by a mother in a tin of tuna chunks is a tongue - eating parasite , experts have claimed			1
@entity6 , 28 , was horrified when she opened the tin of @entity9 tuna to discover the tiny species ' black eyes staring back at her			1
after appealing to experts , scientists at the @entity14 believe they have identified the creature as a @entity17 , or tongue - eating louse , which live inside fish			1
' from what i can see i would support the head of a tongue - eating louse , @entity17 or similar , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity37 manager at the @entity14 told the @entity38			2
' i think these are associates of smaller fish than @entity41 and fish that tuna eat			2
' it is not the first time the parasite has almost made its way onto the plate in @entity49 , with a @entity51 customer shocked to discover an adult @entity53 in a fillet of sea bass			1
@entity56 , 62 , was about to tuck into his dinner when he spotted the gruesome yellow creature inside the fish			2
he took it back to the @entity51 supermarket in @entity62 , where he had bought the sea bass from the fishmonger 's counter			1
ms @entity6 , who lives in @entity65 , discovered the species ' tiny head last week after opening the can of tuna she bought in @entity70			1
previously experts said they thought the head may have belonged to a juvenile crab			1
@entity74 , the can of tuna in which it was found ' i opened the top of the lid and saw a purple thing , a gut sack or intestine - then i turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me , ' said the 28 - year - old			0
@entity17 is more commonly known as the tongue - eating louse and is a parasite , which attaches itself to the tongue of a fish			2
it enters the fish through its gills before attaching itself to the tongue			2
it then replaces the tongue and feeds on the blood of the fish as well as any other food that it takes in			0
the parasite can bite humans but is not thought to be harmful to them in any other way			0
' it 's got like a spiny tail along the bottom - it 's quite grim			0
i dropped the fork , jumped back , screamed a bit and shouted for my nan to come and have a look			0
' after conducting their own investigation , @entity9 however said the creature is more likely to be a juvenile crab than the tongue - eating parasite			1
dr @entity119 , associate professor of veterinary parasitology at the @entity121 , previously said it could be some form of crustacean			0
he said : ' all i can see from the picture is a body and the eyes are very prominent			0
' the legs have been chopped off during the process			0
' an @entity70 spokeswoman said they were awaiting the outcome of the investigation			0
fully grown : an adult @entity17 ( above ) was found in a sea bass bought at the @entity51 fish counter in @entity62 earlier this year the rare parasite latches on to the fish 's tongue , gradually eating away at it before replacing it entirely a larger parasite in the mouth of one fish			1
the tongue - eating parasite works its way into the body through gills			0
