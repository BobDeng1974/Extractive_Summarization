cases of lung cancer in @entity2 have doubled in the past decade with @entity4 officials blaming the rise on smoking			1
however the number of smokers in @entity2 has fallen in recent years while air pollution soared by 30 per cent in the first few months of 2013 , raising fears that the increase could be due to the smog			1
@entity13 , who heads the @entity2 - based center for @entity4 and @entity16 think tank , said : ' how shocking ! this number does n’t even include the floating population			0
rates of lung cancer have doubled in @entity2 in the last decade , and while officials blame smoking , many fear that the city 's smog is to blame ' we must keep our environment from getting worse – no matter what			1
in the past 10 years , the number of smokers and smoking areas have decreased ; why have lung cancer rates increased so much ? ' users of @entity4 social networking site @entity34 agreed			1
one user , @entity35 commented : ' the spike in lung cancer is clearly due to environmental pollution , yet they blame it on smoking			1
' the number of people who smoke has decreased , especially while in public			0
' the figures from the official @entity47 news agency showed the number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people went from 39.56 in 2002 to 63.09 by 2011			0
the news comes a week after an eight - year - old girl was diagnosed with lung cancer which doctors blamed on the country 's dire air quality			1
the @entity57 estimates that around 200,000 people died last year as a result of cancer caused by bad air , and that around half of cases were in @entity4 or @entity64			2
pollution in the developing nation has become so bad thanks to @entity4 having the world 's largest manufacturing sector coupled with the world 's largest population			0
around 100million people in @entity4 are employed in factories of some kind , more than 10 times the number in the @entity73 , and @entity4 accounts for roughly 20 per cent of the world 's industrial output			0
@entity4 's huge industrial sector , which employs around 100million people , has gone unregulated for years as the country drives for growth meaning the air has become polluted decades of industrial growth have been fuelled by weak government regulation which has allowed factories to be built quickly , cheaply , and with little concern for the environmental impact			1
as a result smog levels in @entity2 are now so bad that experts have warned of a national security threat because cctv cameras are unable to see through the haze			0
measures are being being passed to tackle the problem as new government officials fear a backlash from the wealthy middle - class , but past laws have simply been ignored as the country pursues growth at all costs			0
@entity4 's population now stands at 1.4billion , up from just 563million in the mid- 1950s , and accounts for roughly one in five people on the planet			2
that surge has meant huge demand for concrete , glass and steel to build new cities with			0
these very heavy industries are among the most polluting			0
@entity4 's population boom , rising from 563million in 1950s to 1.4billion this year , means the country is the world 's largest consumer of coal which fuels its power stations @entity4 is also the world 's biggest consumer of coal , and around half of all coal used next year is expected to be burned in the country either in power stations or by people heating their homes			1
the government said pollution levels would be cut by slowing the growth of coal consumption so that its share of @entity4 's energy sources fell to 65 percent by 2017			1
last month , choking smog forced @entity4 authorities to shut down one of the country 's largest cities			0
the dense pollution in @entity139 - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres			0
the smog forced schools to suspend classes , caused snarling traffic and closed the airport , in what was the country 's first major air pollution crisis of the winter			2
the cold weather typically brings the worst air pollution to northern @entity4 because of a combination of weather conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and municipal heating systems			2
while smoking in @entity4 is still a huge problem , with 320million people thought to be addicted , it has actually declined in recent years while air pollution has soared @entity4 is also the world 's largest consumer of cigarettes , with an estimated 320million people lighting up every year , more than than the entire population of the @entity73 , and accounting for one in four of the world 's smokers			1
a million people are thought to die every year from tobacco - related illnesses in @entity4 , with most of them being from lung infections including tuberculosis and lung cancer			1
however , in the last 14 years smoking in @entity4 has actually fallen from 63 per cent in 1996 , to 54 per cent in 2010			2
the vast majority of those are elderly men , with just 2 per cent of @entity4 women being addicted			0
in @entity2 , which has some of the worst air quality in the country , just 15 per cent of people smoke .			2

lung cancer rates in @entity4 's *capital* have doubled in a decade
officials blame smoking , saying air pollution is only a factor
while 320million @entity4 smoke , the rate has fallen *steadily* since 1996
meanwhile air pollution has soared 30 per cent in 2013 alone
last week an eight - year - old girl was diagnosed with lung cancer which doctors blamed on poor air quality
