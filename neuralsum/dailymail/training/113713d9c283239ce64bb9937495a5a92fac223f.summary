an @entity5 study conducted in 2012 found that the least expensive domestic tickets were purchased six weeks prior to departure			2
@entity57 , managing director of enterprise information management at @entity5 , said : ‘ this latest study by @entity5 is significant because it reveals that not only have the lowest airfares shifted from six to eight weeks out for domestic travel , but the savings are markedly greater on a percentage basis			0
the best deals for @entity15 domestic routes were found eight weeks before the date of departure ‘ it was also interesting to see that the data showed the least expensive tickets were purchased on a sunday as opposed to tuesday , which is a common belief			0
’ but he recommends people shop around and check prices every day as the best deals may not always be offered on a sunday or tuesday			0
‘ air ticket pricing is dynamic and @entity5 is n't advising anyone to purchase tickets only at these times during the sales cycle as there is no guarantee they will receive the lowest price ; it is just what the data pattern indicates during the study period			0

@entity5 study analysed nearly 130 million ticket purchases
but the study did not include tickets purchased directly from airlines
sunday offered the lowest fares regardless of the destination
tuesday had the best bargains during the traditional work week
for international flights travellers should book 24 weeks in advance
