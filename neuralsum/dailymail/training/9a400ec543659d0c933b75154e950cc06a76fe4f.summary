@entity0 eased to a 3 - 0 home win over @entity2 on sunday afternoon courtesy of second - half goals from @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity8 provides an assessment of each player involved at @entity11			2
@entity0 @entity12 - the @entity14 goalkeeper had been @entity0 's penalty - taking hero in the @entity15 last week but this was a far more mundane afternoon			2
did n't have too many saves to make , even during the first - half which was dominated by @entity2			1
showed some weaknesses - a loose clearance on 13 minutes was seized upon by @entity20 and he spilt a cross shortly before the break			0
6 @entity12 collides with @entity2 's @entity20 during the first - half at @entity11 @entity25 - was able to stride confidently forward more and more as the match wore on as @entity2 retreated into their shell			1
@entity25 completed his defensive and offensive duties well and never looked hurried , with the exception of a late cross that spooned into the stand			0
6.5 @entity34 - solid performance at the heart of the defence until he hobbled off with an injury early in the second - half			1
he bailed out the overwhelmed @entity39 when @entity40 was bearing down on goal after 23 minutes , coming across to clear for a corner			2
@entity34 was also more than willing to play a long ball in the direction of target man @entity5			0
6 @entity0 defender @entity34 clears the ball ahead of @entity2 's @entity45 , injured in the process @entity47 - looked as though he was in for a torrid afternoon when @entity2 striker @entity40 tricked his way past him three times in the opening 25 minutes			1
the worst one saw @entity34 have to rush across and clear			0
but once @entity47 found his composure , and @entity2 's challenge faded , he was fine			2
might have scored when he headed over @entity55 's swerving corner on 12 minutes			0
5.5 @entity47 struggled to get to grips with @entity2 forward @entity40 during the early stages of the game @entity59 - like @entity25 , was given plenty of scope to push further forward as @entity2 's challenge dropped off after half - time			1
he was n't shy in supporting the wingers , delivering crosses or even shooting for goal , as shown by a sixth - minute strike that bounced narrowly wide of the mark			0
6.5 @entity68 usual , his work rate was exemplary from the outset , always gravitating into space to attract a pass			0
did play some loose balls as @entity2 's midfield seized control in the first - half but helped swing the balance back the other way after half - time			1
this was shown by the short burst and magnificent through pass that allowed @entity7 to race clear and score the third goal			0
7.5 @entity85 wins an aerial duel ahead of @entity2 's @entity87 during the opening period @entity55 - struggled to get a stranglehold on the midfield battle initially and his frustrations were shown by a 20th - minute yellow card for a late follow - through tackle on @entity93 after he 'd given the ball away			1
helped enforce and sustain @entity0 's superiority after the break until replaced by @entity6 on 65 minutes			1
6 @entity97 ( c ) - again , helped haul @entity0 's midfield on top as the match wore on and @entity2 's attacking instinct was blunted			1
a tough chance came to him early in the second - half after @entity7 crossed and he could n't keep his shot down			1
struck the crossbar from an almost impossible angle five minutes from time as @entity0 looked for added gloss on the scoreline			0
7 @entity97 just reaches the ball ahead of @entity2 's @entity93 during the @entity111 clash @entity7 - @entity0 's stand - out performer on the day , @entity7 grew into the game and was a constant threat out wide with his dribbles and crossing			1
his performance was capped with a serene left - foot finish for the third goal after @entity85 's exemplary through ball set him into the clear on 71 minutes			2
7.5 @entity5 - a nuisance to the @entity2 back - line throughout , initially with his hold - ups and knock - downs to @entity127 which were important in the first - half as @entity2 were the better side			1
once he had poached his goal on 48 minutes , getting in front of @entity133 to anticipate @entity134 spilling the ball from @entity137 's shot , the game changed in @entity0 's favour			2
7 @entity5 celebrates with @entity127 after putting @entity0 ahead early in the second - half @entity5 uses his strength to manoeuvre the ball away from @entity93 @entity127 - lively and energetic as has become expected			1
the first - half saw him dropping a little too deep as @entity0 struggled to create anything in attack but his powerful shot three minutes after the break led to @entity134 spilling and @entity5 opening the scoring			1
he also supplied an excellent assist to @entity6 for the match - settling second goal on 69 minutes			2
7 substitutes @entity151 ( for @entity34 49 ) - assured at the back as @entity2 's attacking instincts dulled in the second - half			1
6 @entity6 ( for @entity55 65 ) - a lovely composed finish for @entity0 's second goal after having the presence of mind to find space in the right channel			1
6.5 @entity161 ( for @entity47 75 ) - helped ensure there would be no drama late on			0
6 substitutes not used : @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 @entity2 @entity134 - had rarely been troubled in the first - half as @entity0 struggled to impose themselves but was ready and alert towards the end to dive low and bravely deny @entity137 just in front of the goal			1
but he made a real hash of stopping @entity137 's shot early in the second - half , spilling it out for @entity5 to profit			1
5 @entity2 goalkeeper @entity134 should have done better to hold @entity137 's shot before @entity5 pounced @entity45 - withdrew from the match prematurely with what looked to be an arm or shoulder injury after @entity34 landed awkwardly on him following a corner			1
prior to going off in stoppage time , @entity183 had enjoyed plenty of space down the right - flank and was often able to get into a crossing position			0
6 @entity45 was forced to go off in first - half stoppage time after landing heavily on his arm @entity191 - was n't overly taxed in the first - half as those further forward made all the running in the game			1
rescued his side with a clearance following a teasing free - kick delivery on 39 minutes and then took a hefty whack to the face that led to his withdrawal at the break			0
5 @entity133 ( c ) - responsible for the game 's pivotal moment when he was too slow to react to @entity5 's dart across him to give @entity0 the lead			1
until that point had dealt well with the rare attacks @entity0 had produced			0
after that point shared the nervousness that infected the @entity2 back line			0
6 @entity133 jumps with @entity5 in one of the many aerial duels during the match @entity215 - handled most things that came his way in the air , even against @entity5 , and looked resolute in the first - half			1
he gave a sheepish smile after a massive let - off in the second period when his careless sideways pass across the edge of the box was seized upon by @entity137			0
he broke defensive rule no 1 there			0
6 @entity20 - intelligent in his passing and movement , @entity20 was a key component as @entity2 dominated the first 45			2
one moment of note was when he combined well with @entity233 to launch an attack on 37 minutes			0
like his team - mates , was knocked back by @entity0 's first goal and was never quite able to find his rhythm again			2
6 @entity93 - in good form during the first period in terms of tackles to instigate attacks , reading of the play and also a couple of chances that were wide of the mark			0
failed to replicate this after half - time as @entity2 lost their ' bite ' in midfield			2
6 @entity93 closes down @entity0 's @entity7 during the @entity111 encounter @entity87 - was responsible for many of the slick and accurate passes through the midfield that made @entity2 look so impressive before the break			1
but as they were unable to gain a goal , their impressive play counted for nothing and @entity87 was , like many of the others , a passenger in the second - half as @entity0 turned it on			1
6.5 @entity268 - his long strides were a feature of the opening 45 and @entity0 afforded him too much respect coming forward			2
he had fired the opening salvo on five minutes , firing a fierce right - foot shot wide			0
was booked for the faintest of clips on @entity7			0
like the others , lacked impact after the break			0
6 @entity233 - looked threatening down the left flank before half - time and combined well with @entity281 and @entity20			0
he evaded the offside trap on 31 minutes but his cut - back from a very good position was poor			0
grew more ineffective and frustrated in the second - half and was booked for an over-zealous tackle on @entity6 on 74 minutes			1
6 @entity40 - made a blistering start to the match and had @entity47 in knots twice inside the opening two minutes alone			2
he also showed incredible pace to set up a chance for @entity268 on five minutes			0
his best chance arrived on 23 minutes but he seemed to falter in front of goal , took too many touches and was snuffed out by @entity34			0
made little difference in second - half			2
6.5 @entity40 controls the ball wide on the right wing during an impressive first - half performance substitutes @entity302 ( for @entity45 45 +3 ) - was kept busy but unable to stem the @entity0 tide			1
5.5 @entity305 ( for @entity191 ht ) - thrown on ostensibly as a defender but quickly pushed into a more forward - minded position			0
6 @entity308 ( for @entity133 70 ) - arrived with too little and too late to affect the outcome			0
5 substitutes not used : @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313			0

@entity0 defeated @entity2 3 - 0 in @entity111 at @entity11
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 scored the goals
@entity85 and @entity127 also impressed for the @entity0
@entity2 were impressive in the first - half but faded from the game
@entity40 was a threat early on but could n't convert chances
