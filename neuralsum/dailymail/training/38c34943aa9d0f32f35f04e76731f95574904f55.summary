by @entity0 @entity3 ’s close - range strike shortly after half - time was enough for @entity5 ’s @entity4 to beat @entity6 1 - 0 during their friendly at the @entity8 on monday evening			1
the centre - back broke the deadlock in the 51st minute , when he reacted quickest to @entity12 ’s outswinging corner to flick the ball past the despairing dive of @entity6 goalkeeper @entity15			1
the @entity17 ’ recent signing from @entity18 , @entity19 , looked lively in the opening stages , and could have put his side ahead as early as the ninth minute when he met a cross from the right by @entity24 only to head straight into the arms of the grateful @entity15			2
impressed : @entity19 , @entity4 's recent signing from @entity18 , was strong on the ball fit straight in : @entity19 's hold - up play against @entity6 helped bring his team - mates into the game @entity6 : @entity15 ; @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 88 ) , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 53 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 80 ) , @entity41 ; @entity42 ( @entity43 65 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 65 )			1

minutes later @entity19 turned provider for @entity24 , but the young full - back could not find the back of the net with his well - struck effort from distance			0
@entity19 ’s hold - up play was the highlight for @entity5 ’s team in a fairly low - tempo affair at the @entity8 , the @entity80 - born forward keeping the ball well from @entity6 ’s dogged defenders during his 62 minutes on the pitch			2
after dominating much of the first half @entity4 deservedly went ahead six minutes after the break			0
@entity3 prodded past @entity15 from @entity12 ’s enticing corner , and moments later the latter nearly doubled @entity17 ’ lead with a glancing header that flew just over the crossbar			2
@entity6 almost equalised in the dying stages of the match , when @entity43 rounded @entity4 ’s substitute goalkeeper @entity52			1
fortunately for the @entity80 shot - stopper fellow sub @entity95 was on hand to smash the ball away from goal			0
relaxed : @entity17 boss @entity99 looked comfortable despite his side 's nervy win all smiles : @entity5 breaks into a grin during @entity4 's victory at the @entity8 late in the day : @entity44 , of @entity6 , controls the ball during their friendly defeat challenge : @entity12 nips in for a tackle with @entity6 's @entity110 spreading the play : @entity54 sprays a pass out to the right - hand side for @entity4 after the game , @entity5 said : ' i think we deserved one or two more goals in the match			1
there was a good spirit in the team			0
' maybe in front of goal we ’re not so sharp , but i ’m happy about the performance today			0
' @entity4 ’s win comes off the back of victories over lower - league @entity130 side @entity128 and @entity132 of @entity133 .			0
