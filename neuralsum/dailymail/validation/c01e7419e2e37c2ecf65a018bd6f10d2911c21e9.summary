he was the manager who wanted to be sacked			1
for while @entity1 may have vowed to fight on in the wake of saturday ’s 4 - 0 humiliation at home to @entity5 , monday ’s dismissal as head coach of @entity8 would have come as a mighty relief			1
@entity1 has long since lost faith in his vision for @entity8			1
frustrated by the influence of sporting director @entity13 in transfers , he was left with a dysfunctional team made up of players signed by both himself and the club hierarchy			2
@entity1 was sacked as @entity8 manager on monday with the club one point above the relegation zone @entity1 was dismissed following the @entity8 ' 4 - 0 @entity24 defeat at home to @entity5 on saturday goalkeeper @entity25 looks dejected as @entity8 were thrashed 4 - 0 at home by @entity5 @entity27 ( centre ) scored two of @entity5 's goals in the 4 - 0 win on saturday @entity8 fans turned on manager @entity1 ( bottom left ) during the defeat by @entity5 on saturday afteroon @entity35 sacked as @entity8 manager @entity37 's number of days in charge since his arrival on october 8 , 2013			1
75 - the @entity41 's number of games in charge , winning 23 , losing 22 and drawing 30			0
3 - the number of games against bitter rivals @entity44			0
he won them all with an aggregate of 6 - 1			0
35 - @entity1 was the 35th man to manage @entity8 either permanently or as a caretaker			1
22 - the number of years between @entity8 's appearances in a major final			1
@entity1 took them to the 2014 @entity55 final , 22 years on from their defeat to @entity58 in the @entity60 showpiece			1
14 - @entity8 's final position in @entity1 's first season			1
4 - the amount of games won in the @entity24 by @entity8 this season			1
the joint - worst with bottom side @entity68			0
some of @entity1 ’s press - conference outbursts distanced him from the personnel on the pitch and were not well received at boardroom level			1
‘ i am not going to be a head coach when it suits and a manager when it does n’t , ’ he said in december			2
‘ it is clear what we need to do			0
that is down to recruitment			0
so , if you ever get the chance to speak to anyone on the recruitment side and ask them about it , you are lucky			0
if you do n’t , do n’t ask me			0
’ such comments would not have been tolerated at other clubs and @entity13 informed owner @entity91 that @entity1 was not the man to take them forward			1
@entity1 grew particularly disillusioned during january and when he let coach @entity95 take a pre-match and half - time team talk there was a feeling he had lost interest			1
subsequent team selections left players and senior figures baffled - four central midfielders named in the starting @entity103 versus @entity104 , who play with wing - backs , being the most alarming example			0
@entity1 had lost his faith in his vision for @entity8 and was fed up sporting director @entity13 ( centre ) @entity1 advised his son @entity110 to sign for @entity111 last july rather than join him at the @entity112 but the players should not escape criticism , either			1
this is the third manager , following @entity116 and @entity117 , who has been sacked with the core of the current squad on the books			2
they have fought relegation during the past two seasons and have survived despite falling short of 40 points on each occasion			2
the squad has gone stale and so had @entity1			2
he did not think the players were good enough to implement the attractive football he craved			0
certainly , not once was there any evidence of such a brand of play during his 17 months in charge			0
tellingly , the @entity41 also advised his son @entity110 to sign for @entity111 last july rather than join him at the @entity112			0
then there was his failure to promote from within the club ’s academy , a major source of contention among staff who work with the youngsters			0
indeed , they were miffed at the sight of assistant boss @entity143 joining in first - team sessions rather than sending for one of their players			0
but @entity1 ’s refusal to entertain academy prospects - not one such player started a game during his tenure - was symptomatic of his loss of love for the project on @entity156			2
results , if not performances , were always just enough - 14 draws this season - to keep talk of a crisis in the background			0
@entity1 was appointed by @entity8 in october 2013 following the sacking of @entity117 but discord and discontent rumbled all the while and only now is it all being laid bare after the situation unravelled on the pitch in such shambolic fashion at the weekend			1
@entity1 ’s behaviour in the dressing - room on saturday did little to convince the players he was scrapping for his and their survival			2
for @entity1 no longer wanted to be at the club and the key powerbrokers no longer wanted him there , either			1
his sacking was the best outcome for all parties			0
