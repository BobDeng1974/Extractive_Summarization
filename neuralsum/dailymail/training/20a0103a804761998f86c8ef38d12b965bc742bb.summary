it ’s every beer drinker ’s worst nightmare : you set your bottle down on a table and open it , only for the drink to foam up and come shooting out , drenching the table and most likely you as well			2
but that nightmare might soon become a thing of the past thanks to an unlikely source : magnets			0
researchers have found that applying a magnetic field to an antifoaming agent , they can reduce the foaming effect to a huge degree - and it could bring the cost of beer down in future			1
@entity21 researchers have used magnets to make beer less foamy			1
applying a magnetic field made antifoaming agents more effective			1
the field is applied when hops extract is added to beer 's malt base			1
this prevents it from attracting too much @entity31 - which causes foam the research , led by @entity34 from the @entity35 in @entity21 , studied the effect of a bottle of beer overfoaming			1
known as gushing , it occurs when fungi infect the beer ’s malt base , latching on with surface proteins called hydrophobins , according to @entity45			2
if you ’ve ever been a student at university , you ’ve likely experienced the effects of hitting the bottom of one beer bottle against the neck of another			0
doing so will cause the struck beer to foam up uncontrollably - but what ’s the science behind this process ? earlier this year a study carried out by the @entity58 and the @entity59 , in @entity60 , found that it occurs in three phases			2
first , expansion and compression waves appear			0
these advance inside the liquid and cause the gas cavities ( bubbles ) to burst at the bottom of the bottle			0
afterwards , small balls of foam are formed because the bubbles break into even smaller ones			0
finally , given that they weigh less than the liquid surrounding them , these bubbles move to the surface so rapidly that the final result is similar to an explosion when the beer is being brewed , these hydrophobins attract carbon dioxide molecules , which make the beer bubbly			0
to counteract the effects , brewers use hops extract , which is an antifoaming agent that binds to the proteins and prevents them attracting @entity31			1
however , the process is not wholly effective , and beer can still become overly bubbly or foamy in some instances			2
the latest study though found that when a magnetic field was applied to malt , the hops extract was broken into smaller particles			1
to apply the field , the researchers passed the liquid through a tube with a magnet wrapped around it			0
they found that this increased the effectiveness of the antifoaming agent , prevent co2 from binding with the hydrophobins			0
in fact , the method was so effective that much lower amounts of hops extract were needed , reducing the cost of brewing the beer in the first place			1
and the process , which takes only a minute , also made the beer taste less bitter			2
the method was so effective that much lower amounts of hops extract ( stock image of hops pictured ) were needed , reducing the cost of brewing the beer in the first place			1
the method takes just one minute and could make beer cheaper - as less hops extract is needed to prevent the formation of foam ‘ the results indicate that when a magnetic field exerted on hop extract , this compound is dispersed more and smaller particles are formed , ’ the researchers write in their paper			1
‘ therefore , the specific surface areas of the particles are increased and interact with larger numbers of hydrophobins			0
’ the research , to be published in the january edition of the @entity141 , took place at the @entity21 @entity143			0
and the next step will be to try and increase the scale of the method , to increase it to industrial - level production .			0
