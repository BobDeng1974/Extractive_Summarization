' there was a @entity12 page for it -- shot them a message , expressed my interest , they got back to me , told me to send them , essentially , a resume for their vetting purposes , ' @entity16 explained			1
' what i believe is that they are @entity59 go - betweens , they are not in @entity21 , they operate receiving information of interested @entity63 , and then they either relay it or make a decision themselves of whether or not this person is suitable to work with the @entity22 , ' he added			2

' @entity16 's military background appeared to be an asset to the fighters , who arranged for him to be met at the airport in @entity3 from where was taken to the front lines			1
