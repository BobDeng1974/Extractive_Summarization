today she told @entity24 how she was the victim of a brutal assault in central @entity3 , which she described as ' the most horrendous experience of my life ' , and one which contributed to her realising she was a lesbian			1
in a revealing interview with the paper , miss @entity1 said she was walking home along a busy road in central @entity3 shortly before midnight when someone gripped her arm and kicked her leg , knocking her over			1
she said : ' i gasped , overbalanced and landed painfully with a suffocating weight on top of me			0
' after the attack , which she said left her feeling vulnerable despite being brought up in the capital , she went with a nurse friend to a hospital in @entity45 , @entity46 , where dna samples were taken and medics photographed her bruised body			0
because the attack happened in 1999 , before the 2004 change in the law that recognised transsexual people 's new genders , the rape was only classified as an assault			2
miss @entity1 said that she had begun to feel attracted to women shortly before the attack , and had her first sexual experience with a woman with a lesbian she met playing pool in @entity63			1
she said she put the ' scary ' idea that she might be attracted to women out of her mind , but said the rape made her ' very anti-men ' , and contributed to her realising she was a lesbian soon afterwards			1

they do not live together but have been in a relationship since 2006			2
she said her fellow @entity7 politicians had been very accepting of her sexuality , whereas she had encountered the most homophobia from @entity79			2
miss @entity1 said yesterday she had been ' overwhelmed by all the support ' she had received after revealing in the @entity24 on sunday that she had had gender reassignment surgery at the age of 23			1

' @entity100 is a powerful personal story			0
yet she insists it is only one facet of her life , and though it tormented her childhood and teenage years , it is one that no longer dominates her or her future			0
it adds : ' as the first " sex change " parliamentarian in @entity5 , @entity1 has made history			1
' but she is likely to be far happier , in the future , being known less as a statistic than for her conviction politics			0
' miss @entity1 is keen that her revelations do not overshadow her politicial ambition , and has commissioned a poll to see whether voters minded if a candidate was transsexual			2
it showed that two - thirds of people said it would make no difference to how they voted and fewer than 10 per cent said it would make them much less likely to favour a candidate			0
in her autobiography @entity84 , miss @entity1 also writes about her determination for an @entity19 referendum ' i do n't want my past to overshadow it and believe my constituents will continue to support me , ' she said			2
