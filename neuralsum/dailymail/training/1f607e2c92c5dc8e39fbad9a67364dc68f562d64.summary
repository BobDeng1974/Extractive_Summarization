@entity1 , around of 900 million miles from @entity0 , is the second largest planet in our solar system			2
orbitting it are 62 moons and , since its arrival in 2004 , @entity10 ’s @entity9 spacecraft , which has been sending back images and data on some of them , and the planet itself			1
and now , in a series of enhanced images from the spacecraft , the detail and beauty that was previously hidden in some of the photos has been revealed			2
@entity23 programmer @entity22 added colour and touched up the snaps to reveal new details			1
in the images the gas giant @entity1 and its moons are featured			1
here is @entity31 ( background ) and @entity33 , with the former 2.038 million km from @entity9 and the latter 1.329 million km the amazing new photos were created by @entity23 computer programmer @entity35			1
he highlights a stunning array of features on the gas giant and its moons including @entity31 and @entity41			1
the latter , for example , can be seen with pockmarked craters across its surface			0
in another image , it is seen dwarfed by the much larger @entity31 , as @entity9 made a rare pass that saw the two align			1
the hazy atmosphere of @entity1 ’s @entity31 is also revealed in stunning detail , with a noticeable ‘ thin blue line ’ between where the atmosphere ends and space begins			1
and @entity1 is also given some additional treatment , with the huge planet and its rings seen partially lit up by the sun. writing on his @entity59 page , mr @entity22 said he created the images because he was ‘ somewhat underwhelmed by the frequency the @entity62 releases colour composites			1
' the majestic @entity1 is seen here with part of the planet lit up , while the rings of dust can also be seen encircling the planet			2
@entity31 can also be seen above the planet in the top right			2
the faint greenish colour to the left of the planet is residual camera glare that could not be removed here the surface of @entity77 can be seen in exquisite detail , with the sun also lighting up part of the moon			2
it 's thought it may have an ocean of water underneath its surface @entity41 is seen in front of @entity31			1
the distance to @entity31 in the image is 3.163 million km , and the distance to @entity41 is 1.611 million km he continued : ‘ the images you see here are ( more or less ) calibrated images that were released to the @entity95			1
the downside of the pds is the data releases are delayed about nine months in order to give the imaging team priority over analysing data			0
‘ other than that , the @entity95 data allow more accurate reconstruction of colours and brightnesses over the histogram - stretched jpeg images			0
’ @entity1 is the sixth planet from the @entity109 and second largest in the @entity110 after @entity111			0
the planet was named after the @entity114 god who also lends his name to saturday			0
the gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of @entity0			2
while just one - eighth the average density of @entity0 , its larger volume means @entity1 is more than 95 times bigger than @entity0			0
the planet 's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron , nickel and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer			0
the planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere			0
wind speeds on @entity1 can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on @entity111 but slower than on @entity140			0
the prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs			0
they are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust			0
there are 62 known moons - 53 of which are officially named - orbiting the planet			0
@entity31 is @entity1 's largest and the @entity110 's second largest moon - bigger even than @entity153			1
the small irregular @entity155 is seen here from a distance of 104,500km			0
the moon has a radius of about 130km , while several craters on its surface are larger than 30km the atmosphere of @entity31 is seen here , which is often said to be the most @entity0 - like place in the solar system aside from our planet			2
the moon is also known to have liquids on its surface in lakes and seas in recent months @entity9 has revealed some fascinating insights into the @entity1 system			1
towards the end of november , @entity10 announced that the spacecraft had created the most detailed maps yet of several of @entity1 ’s moons			2
these included the icy surface of @entity77 , which may have a liquid ocean underground , and the bizarre ‘ tow - toned ’ world of @entity183			0
@entity9 also spotted the glint of the sun on the surface of one of @entity31 ’s lakes - confirming the presence of liquids on its surface			1
and data released today suggests that there are sand tunes on @entity31 that may have been shaped by the moon ’s wind			0
cassini mission around @entity1 will continue until 2017 , when it will be sent crashing into gas giant ’s atmosphere to prevent it contaminating any of the nearby moons as its fuel runs out .			1

@entity23 programmer @entity22 *improved* @entity9 's images by adding colour and touching up photos
gas giant @entity1 and its moons are featured , with some showing the hazy atmosphere of @entity31 and surface of @entity41
mr @entity22 created the images because he was ‘ underwhelmed by the frequency the @entity62 releases colour composites '
