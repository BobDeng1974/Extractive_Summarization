by @entity0 follow @ @ robshepherd5 most of the debate leading up to @entity4 's showdown with @entity5 has been about @entity6 and where he should play or if at all			1
that big debate has disguised the fact that @entity4 skipper @entity10 was far from a commanding figure against @entity12 and he certainly did n't pull any strings in his new quarter back role in comparison to @entity16 for @entity12			1
but in @entity10 's defence he did hold his position and thus helped @entity4 keep their shape for most of the game			1
against @entity5 though @entity10 must impose himself more			1
if not then @entity21 must not be afraid to sub his captain and put on @entity24			1
otherwise what was the point in picking the former @entity28 man in the first place ? one aspect of @entity4 's opening game defeat to @entity12 was the sporting spirit which it was played in with the sole yellow card falling to @entity34 late on for a blatant ' technical foul '			1
@entity37 referee @entity36 deserves much credit for how he allowed the game to flow but it could be another story in the @entity4 ' clash against @entity5 on thursday			1
@entity42 referee @entity41 has a reputation of being an over-fussy official who at one stage of his career averaged six yellow cards a game			2
he is now a bit less trigger happy but in the @entity51 opener between @entity52 and @entity53 he issued two red cards			2
seeing yellow : @entity34 ( left ) was the only player to be booked during @entity4 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity12 trigger happy : referee @entity58 ( left ) sent off two players in the @entity51 opener of @entity52 vs @entity53 it 's interesting to note that while @entity34 was the stand out player against @entity12 , covering 6.52 miles , two @entity4 players travelled further in the match			1
@entity6 clocked up 6.97 miles while @entity10 covered 6.58 - which just goes to show why that kind of stat is often meaningless			1
working up a sweat : @entity6 ( left ) ran 6.97 miles during @entity4 's @entity70 opener against @entity12 while @entity21 looks set to tinker with his system against @entity5 , if not personnel , @entity72 boss @entity71 is revealing to @entity76 fans one his great strengths as a coach ahead of next season			1
the 62 - year - old has a well thought - out plan and team in his mind and he sticks to it			2
@entity72 named the same starting line - up for their first two @entity87 wins , against @entity88 and @entity89 , with the starting eleven numbered 1 - 11 - making them the only the nation to have done that so far			2
talk about having a plan			2
it also suggests @entity94 wo n't succumb to @entity6 deciding where he wants to play at @entity96			2
tactical genius : @entity71 has masterminded @entity72 to two wins out of two at the @entity87 the have been some truly stunning goals at the his @entity87 but precious few long range scorchers			0
@entity72 's late winner struck by @entity103 , whose name sounds like a @entity106 singer , was a rarity			0
thus far only 13 per cent of goals have been stuck from more than 20 yards			0
scorcher : @entity103 scored @entity72 's winner their 3 - 2 victory vs @entity89 with a long - range strike look out for if you can manage to carry on after the @entity4 match then @entity116 's @entity115 is a player to keep an eye out for			0
the @entity121 midfielder scored a super goal and oozed class in @entity116 's 2 - 1 defeat to the @entity125 but they should bounce back against @entity53 if @entity127 produces similar form			0
top draw : @entity115 ( front ) enjoyed a fine performance in @entity116 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity125 @entity133 the bookies make @entity136 a slight favourite to draw first blood in the @entity139 showdown at 5 - 1 to score the opening goal while @entity141 is 6 - 1			0
this might sound a bit left field but i just fancy @entity146 , who got unfair stick after the @entity12 game , at 22 - 1			1
if @entity4 get an early free kick in his ' zone ' then it could happen			0
@entity153 remain 7 - 2 favourites to win the tournament but @entity72 have been cut to 11 - 1			0
could this at long last but an @entity72 summer ? worth a punt ? @entity136 is the bookies favourites to score first in @entity4 's clash against @entity5 @entity159 it became one of the most tragic episodes in football history			1
much fancied @entity164 flopped at the 1994 @entity87 finals not least because of the influence drug cartels and betting syndicates around the squad			0
they were knocked out when defender @entity170 scored an own goal in defeat to the @entity173			0
a few days later having returned home to @entity175 , @entity170 was shot dead outside a bar after a row with some gangsters			0
@entity179 missed : @entity170 was sadly killed after @entity181 's exit at the 1994 @entity87			0

@entity10 must impose himself against @entity5 on thursday
@entity10 held his position well against @entity12 but was *outshone* by @entity16
if @entity10 fails to deliver @entity21 should sub him for @entity24
