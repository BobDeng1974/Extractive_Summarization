by @entity1 reporter published : 18:16 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 05:43 est , 20 march 2012 @entity2 scored an overwhelming win in @entity6 's @entity5 presidential primary on sunday			1
he trounced chief rival @entity7 on the @entity9 island even as the two rivals looked ahead to more competitive contests this week in @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity2 's wife , @entity14 , urged republicans to unite behind her husband			1
' it 's time to come together , ' she said at a rally in suburban @entity19			0
' it 's time to get behind one candidate and get the job done so we can move on to the next challenge , bringing us one step closer to defeating @entity26			0
' keep smiling : @entity5 presidential candidate @entity2 was given a drawing of himself on the campaign trail in @entity12			1
he beat rival @entity7 in the @entity6 primary victory : @entity2 and @entity32 both spoke after his win in the @entity6 primary on sunday night late on sunday night , with 61 per cent of the @entity35 votes counted , @entity2 had 83 per cent of them			2
he won all 20 delegates to the national convention at stake because he prevailed with more than 50 percent of the vote			1
that padded his comfortable lead over @entity7 in the race to amass the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination			0
@entity2 announced the @entity6 win at the @entity12 rally and told the crowd , ' i intend to become our nominee and i intend to get @entity52 voters to vote for a @entity5 and take back the @entity53			1
' the @entity7 campaign accused @entity2 of pandering			2
' @entity2 says he supports @entity56 as the official language of @entity58 while on the mainland , but then says @entity6 do n't have to learn @entity56 while he 's on @entity6 , ' @entity7 communications director @entity55 said in a press release			1
ok by me in @entity58 : today , @entity7 slipped and called @entity6 a @entity63 - speaking country behind : @entity7 's controversial remarks about @entity56 and @entity63 damaged his chances in @entity6 as the day began , @entity7 claimed he was in contest for the long haul because @entity2 is a weak front - runner			1
' this is a primary process where somebody had a huge advantage , huge money advantage , huge advantage of establishment support and he has n't been able to close the deal and even come close to closing the deal , ' @entity7 said			0
' that tells you that there 's a real flaw there			0
' yet @entity7 sidestepped when asked if he would fight @entity2 on the convention floor if he failed before august to stop the former @entity83 governor from getting the required number of delegates			1
@entity2 , in turn , expressed confidence that he 'd prevail			2
' i ca n't tell you exactly how the process is going to work , ' @entity2 said			2
' but i bet i 'm going to become the nominee			0
' both campaigned in @entity6 last week - in a campaign focused on statehood for the @entity58 territory - but @entity2 cut short his trip so he could head to @entity12 and @entity7 spent sunday in @entity13			1
@entity12 , a more moderate @entity98 state , votes on tuesday and is seen as more friendly territory for @entity2 , while @entity7 is the favorite in the more conservative @entity103 state of @entity13 , which votes on saturday			1
@entity104 marks the spot : @entity6 's governor @entity106 shows his ballot to the press after marking it with an ' x ' under the photo of @entity2 during the @entity5 presidential primary election after the @entity6 victory , @entity2 had 521 delegates in his camp and @entity7 had 253 , according to @entity116 's tally			1
former house speaker @entity117 trailed with 136 delegates and @entity120 rep. @entity119 had 50			0
@entity121 , the @entity5 representative on the @entity122 , told the @entity116 that @entity2 ' won the @entity35 primary by a huge margin and we are granting him the 20 delegates			1
' at this rate , @entity2 is on pace to capture the nomination in june unless @entity7 or @entity130 is able to win decisively in the coming contests			2
both have said they would stay in the race and perhaps force the nomination to a fight at the @entity5 's convention in @entity137 if @entity2 does n't amass enough delegates to arrive with a mandate			1
that would turn the convention into an intra-party brawl for the first time since 1976			0
even as @entity7 declined to commit to forcing a brokered convention , his advisers were working behind the scenes on a plan to persuade convention delegates to switch candidates if the former @entity151 senator fails to derail @entity2 before that			1
inevitable ? @entity2 is seeking to cast his candidacy as unstoppable in an effort to end the race quickly @entity2 's aides call this a fantasy scenario even as they try to prevent delegates from defecting			1
half of the states have yet to weigh in on a race with seemingly no end in sight anytime soon			0
that 's prompted fresh speculation within the @entity5 over whether a contested convention is likely			2
@entity168 national chairman @entity168 insisted that party will have a nominee sooner rather than later			0
' we 're only at halftime , ' @entity168 said			0
' i think that this process is going to play itself out			0
we will have a nominee , i think , fairly soon - one , two months away			0
' in @entity6 , the race was focused on the issue of statehood , and @entity121 said , ' this proves governor @entity2 's electability and his ability to reach out to @entity52 and minorities			2
' whether that 's true or not , @entity2 told @entity6 he would support statehood while @entity7 said @entity56 would have to be the official language of the island if it were to join the @entity58 - a statement that roiled residents			1
' in @entity6 , we get along fine with both languages , ' said @entity190 , a 76 - year - old architect who supported @entity2 and hopes @entity6 becomes the nation 's 51st state			2
support : one of the reality tv @entity195 clan hands out campaign signs at a @entity7 rally even as @entity6 voted , @entity2 and @entity7 traded barbs from afar			2
' @entity7 has the same economic lightweight background the president has , ' @entity2 told a crowd in @entity203 , @entity12			1
he went a step further in @entity205 , saying , ' we 're not going to replace an economic lightweight with another economic lightweight			0
' that drew a @entity7 retort : ' if @entity2 's an economic heavyweight , we 're in trouble			0
' aside from a pair of tv interviews , @entity7 spent the day visiting a pair of churches in @entity13 , sharing how his faith has shaped his political career and his opposition to abortion rights and gay marriage			0
he did n't mention @entity2 or any of his other @entity5 opponents during talks at both churches			1
he made clear he did n't plan to exit the race anytime soon , saying in @entity226 , @entity13 , ' one of the great blessings i 've had in every political campaign is people underestimate me , people underestimate what @entity233 can do			0
' but he was curt when asked about his odds in @entity12			0
' keep working , ' @entity7 said after services there			0
' that 's all we can do			0

@entity2 won all 20 delegates from the @entity58 territory
