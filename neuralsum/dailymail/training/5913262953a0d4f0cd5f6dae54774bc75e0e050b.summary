by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 11:27 est , 10 march 2014 as women hit their half century , skin begins to sag , fine lines appear and confidence levels often drop as a result			0
but how do you beat the wrinkles and give your skin a surge of life without turning to plastic surgery ? one beauty company thinks it has the answer to help diminish the signs of mature skin by combating the signs of menopause			2
the new anti-ageing cream ? @entity20 has unveiled @entity21 - a range of skin creams designed to beat wrinkles by combatting the signs of menopause on the skin the @entity27 range claims to target the signs of menopause , which founders say requires particular attention beyond regular anti-ageing needs			1
the beauty brand , favoured by the likes of @entity33 and @entity34 , has developed a capsule range of three products to respond to the direct effects hormonal change can have on the skin using ingredients that are specific to helping skin control functions lost as we age			2
speaking about her brainchild , which goes on sale in @entity46 today and is priced between £ 75 - £ 150 , founder of @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ' one side - effect of menopause is a reduction of estrogen production , resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility , creating a " crepy " texture ' , explains @entity49			1
' protein synthesis , particularly that of collagen and elastin , are partially controlled by estrogens			0
thus , during menopause , the lowered estrogen levels result in less production and repair of collagen and elastin in the dermis of the skin			1
' a normal anti-ageing cream is not going to help when the cause of the problem is a drop in the level of hormones			0
we are addressing the cause of the problem and expecting a better anti-ageing result as opposed to using a conventional anti-ageing product			0
' how does it work ? menopause causes a reduction of estrogen production , resulting in a loss of supportive function below the skin allowing sagging wrinkles to appear with loss of mobility , creating a crepy texture , which the cream claims to combat the secret ingredient in the trio of creams - one for face , one for body and one serum , is wild yam , which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy for years			1
a study by @entity105 , entitled effects of wild yam extract on menopausal symptoms , lipids and sex hormones in healthy menopausal women , found that that short - term treatment with topical wild yam extract in women suffering from menopausal symptoms left them free of side - effects			1
explaining this ingredient choice , @entity49 said : ' the drop in oestrogen that happens from the age of 35 onwards is a major cause of skin ageing			0
my theory is that if you can trick the skin into thinking that hormones are back to the pre- 35 levels , the ageing process can be reversed			2
secret ingredient : the range is packed with wild yam , which the brand say has been used as a natural alternative supplement to estrogen therapy ' by having the skin believe it 's receiving more estrogen from the natural alternative wild yam , it produces more collagen			1
' it is also packed with black cohosh , which claims to help control sebum production that can be a side - effect of hormonal change on the skin			1
' combined with black cohosh , which helps control sebum production , the skin is significantly and cosmetically enhanced during and post menopause , ' said @entity49			1
this is n't the first time that @entity48 has developed a product like this , a few years ago the company brought out the @entity155 range , which was used cosmetically to ' fool ' the skin into thinking it had been lightly stung with the toxin melittin			0
this causes the body to direct blood towards the area and stimulates the production of the naturally - occurring chemicals collagen and elastin			2
@entity49 concluded : ' when we started developing a range for mature skin , we wanted to get the message across that when you reach your 50s , 60s and beyond , this is the time to celebrate your life , your skin and your body			0
' to us the word " cougar " is a term that has nothing to do with a younger boyfriend and everything to do with taking control of your life and being the best that you can be			0
we want to empower women , offer them the best skincare and a positive message about this beautiful time in their lives			0
