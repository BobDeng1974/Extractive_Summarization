by @entity1 reporter @entity3 executives say it was striking the first time they witnessed a man shave while sitting barefoot on the floor in a tiny hut in @entity9			1
he had no electricity , no running water and no mirror			0
the 20 @entity15 - based executives observed the man in 2008 during one of 300 visits they made to homes in rural @entity9			1
the goal ? to gain insights they could use to develop a new razor for @entity9			1
‘ that , for me , was a big ' a-ha , ' ‘ said @entity24 , vice president , global @entity25 , a unit of @entity3			1
‘ i had never seen people shaving like that			0
’ oops : @entity25 shave products are now seeing success in the huge @entity9 market , but their first attempt was an embarrassing flop the visits kicked off the 18 months it took to develop @entity39 , a low - cost razor designed for @entity9 and other emerging markets			1
introduced three years ago , @entity42 quickly gained market share and today represents two out of every three razors sold in @entity9			1
the story of how @entity42 came to be illustrates the balance companies must strike when creating products for emerging markets : it 's not as simple as slapping a foreign label on an @entity15 product			1
to successfully sell products overseas , particularly in developing markets , companies must tweak them so they 're relevant to the people who live there			0
and often , that means rethinking everything from the product 's design to its cost			0
more companies will have to consider this balancing act as they increasingly move into emerging markets such as @entity9 , @entity64 and @entity65 to offset slower growth in developed regions such as the @entity15 for its part , @entity3 has doubled the percentage of its roughly $ 20 billion in annual revenue coming from emerging markets since 2000 to about 40 percent			1
@entity72 , a @entity73 analyst who follows @entity3 , said the @entity42 razor , which has been used by more than 50 million men in @entity9 , serves as a roadmap for companies seeking to court emerging markets			1
unfocused group : @entity25 tested its @entity80 razor on @entity82 students of @entity9 descent rather than on @entity9 residents			1
the problem ? unlike all @entity9 , the students all used running water ‘ it made @entity3 realize how much investment it really takes to be successful in @entity9 , ’ he said			1
‘ that 's the art of emerging markets			0
’ @entity9 long has been an attractive country for @entity15 companies looking for growth			2
it has 1.24 billion people			0
and its economy is bustling : @entity9 's annual gross domestic product growth was 3.2 percent in 2012 , according to the @entity98 , compared with 2.2 percent in the @entity15 the same year			2
still , @entity9 's widespread poverty presents challenges for companies used to customers with more disposable income			2
@entity9 's per capita income is just about $ 124 a month , compared with $ 4,154 in the @entity15 , according to the @entity98			2
@entity25 has sold razors in @entity9 for over a decade			1
the company had 37.3 percent market share in 2007 , selling its high end @entity108 , which costs about $ 2.75 , and a stripped down @entity80 two - bladed razor on the lower end , which goes for about 72 cents			1
learning : when it took on the @entity9 market again with the guard , @entity25 took into consideration the country 's widespread lack of running water but @entity25 wanted more of the market			1
to do that , @entity3 executives would have to attract the nearly 500 million @entity9 who use double - edged razors , an old fashioned t - shaped razor that has no protective piece of plastic that goes between the blade and the skin when shaving			1
this razor , which makes skin cuts more likely , costs just a few pennies per blade			2
@entity24 , who spearheaded @entity25 's effort to grow market share in @entity9 , did n't want to rush into designing a product , though			1
@entity25 had stumbled once before with its early version of the @entity80 in 2002			1
the version of that razor had a plastic push bar that slid down to unclog the razor			2
the bar was added because @entity9 men have thicker hair and a higher hair density than their @entity15 counterparts			2
adding to that , they often shave less frequently than @entity15 men , so they wind up shaving longer beards			0
@entity25 , which is based in @entity149 , wanted to test the product among @entity9 consumers before launching it , but instead of making the costly trip abroad , they had @entity9 students at nearby @entity82 test the razor			1
‘ they all came back and said ' wow that 's a big improvement , ' @entity24 recalls			0
but when @entity25 launched the razor in @entity9 , the reaction was different			1
executives were baffled about why the razor flopped until they traveled to @entity9 and observed men using a cup of water to shave			1
all the @entity82 students had running water			1
without that , the razor stayed clogged			0
‘ that 's another ' a-ha ' moment , ’ @entity24 said			2
‘ that taught us the importance that you really need to go where your consumers are , not just to talk to them , but observe and spend time with them to gather the key insight			0
’ @entity3 acquired @entity25 in 2005 and the next several years were spent integrating the companies			2
but in 2008 , the focus on @entity9 returned when @entity24 decided to bring 20 people , ranging from engineers to developers , from @entity25 's @entity15 headquarters to @entity9 for three weeks			1
they spent 3,000 hours with more than 1,000 consumers at their homes , in stores and in small group discussions			0
they observed people 's routines throughout the day , sometimes staying late into the evening			0
they also hosted small group discussions			0
‘ we asked them what their aspirations were and why they wanted to shave , and how often , ’ @entity197 said			0
they learned that families often live in huts without electricity and share a bathroom with other huts			0
so men shave sitting on their floors with a bowl of water , often without a mirror , in the dark morning hours			0
as a result , shaving could take up to half an hour , compared with the five to seven minutes it takes to shave in @entity15 households			0
and @entity9 men strain to not cut themselves			2
the takeaway : in the @entity15 , razor makers spent decades on marketing centered on a close shave , adding blade after blade to achieve a smoother cheek			0
but men in @entity9 are more concerned about not cutting themselves			2
‘ i worked in this category for 23 years and i never realized with those insights that 's how they think about the product , ’ said @entity223 , @entity25 's director of research and development , global shave care			2
with that knowledge , the @entity25 team started making a new razor for the @entity9 market			1
in nine months , @entity3 developed five prototypes			0
the company declined to give specifics on each prototype for competitive reasons			0
but they tested things like handle designs , how well the blade cuts hair and how easy the razor is to rinse			0
the resulting @entity42 razor has one blade , to put the emphasis on safety rather than closeness , compared with two to five blades found on @entity15 razors			1
one insight from filming shavers was that @entity9 grip the razors in many different ways , so the handle is textured to allow for easy gripping			2
there 's also a hole at the handle 's base , to make it easier to hang up , and a small comb by the blade since @entity9 hair growth tends to be thicker			2
next , the company had to figure out how to produce the razor at the right price			0
‘ we had to say ' how do we do this at ruthless cost ? ' ‘ @entity24 said			0
@entity3 scrutinized the smallest details			0
it cut the number of components in the razor down to 4 compared with 25 needed for @entity276 , @entity25 's three - blade razor			1
they even made the razor 's handle hollow so it would be lighter and cheaper to make			0
‘ i can remember talking about changes to this product that were worth a thousandth , or two thousandths of a cent , ’ said @entity282 , the company 's associate director for product engineering			0
the result ? the guard costs about one third of what it costs to make the vector			0
@entity25 sells the guard for 15 rupees , or 34 cents , and each razor blade is 5 rupees , or 12 cents			1
the company 's strategy seems to have worked			0
@entity3 says with 9 percent market share , @entity42 has grown share faster than any other @entity3 brand in @entity9			1
and @entity25 's market share for razors and blades in @entity9 has grown to 49.1 percent , according to @entity305			1
that 's up from 37.3 in 2007 .			0

@entity25 makes the @entity42 razor , which accounts for two of every three razor now sold in @entity9
but in 2002 , its *predecessor* the @entity80 was a *massive* flop after intense focus grouping with @entity82 students rather than @entity9 residents
' a-ha moment ' : developers quickly learned to better understand the *exploding* market
