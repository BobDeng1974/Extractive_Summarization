by @entity0 gut feeling : brain disease can be caused by an unhealthy stomach anxiety or anticipation can often lead to a feeling of ‘ butterflies in the stomach ’ – which usually dissipates along with the source of the consternation			1
but scientists have discovered that the nerve pathways between the gut and the brain that cause this phenomenon may also be linked to degenerative illnesses such as parkinson ’s disease and multiple sclerosis ( @entity18 ) , as well as some mental health problems			1
dr @entity20 , consultant neuro - gastroenterologist at @entity21 and the @entity22 , explained : ‘ the gut and brain share the same nerve chemistry and have a dialogue			1
' that ’s why when you feel stress and other strong emotions , such as fear , it leads to gastrointestinal symptoms , like rushing to the loo			2
’ a new study suggests that brain disease can be caused by an unhealthy gut because these signals also travel in the opposite direction			1
the study , which was published in the journal @entity40 , found that sufferers of @entity16 had a higher prevalence of a condition called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , or @entity45			1
in @entity45 , normally harmless bacteria proliferate in large numbers in the small intestine			2
symptoms include excess gas , abdominal bloating , diarrhoea and abdominal pain			0
nobody is sure how many people have it , as it often goes undiagnosed or is confused with irritable bowel syndrome , but estimates are of up to 300,000 @entity61 sufferers			0
and the researchers suggest that the bacteria may produce chemicals that affect the nerves in the gut , which pass on the damage to the brain – and result in @entity16 ’s and @entity18 dr @entity20 said : ‘ we now think that neurological diseases such as @entity18 and @entity16 ’s are linked to the gut being more leaky , permitting pathogens into the bloodstream and causing an antibody response			1
either the pathogens , directly , or the immune response , indirectly , may damage nerve tissue			0
’ the damaged nerves then transmit these detrimental signals to the brain			2
@entity82 tummy : the ' butterflies in the stomach ' feeling could be linked to parkinson 's disease and multiple sclerosis in @entity16 ’s , a small part of the brain becomes progressively damaged over many years , something that affects mainly older people			1
@entity18 is the most common neurological disease in young adults and occurs when the immune system attacks the nervous system			1
the two diseases affect about 100,000 and 127,00 people in the @entity61 respectively			0
both have wide - ranging symptoms , affecting movement as well as causing tiredness , pain and depression			0
there are drugs that can ease symptoms , but no cure or even treatments that significantly slow down progression of the diseases			0
scientists hope that this discovery will pave the way for new treatments for both these disabling conditions			0
they are now mapping the ‘ bacterial genome ’ , which will identify the bacteria in an individual ’s gut – something they hope will ultimately allow doctors to prescribe tailored treatments for leakiness of the gut , improving neurological symptoms in turn			2
until then , the doctors ’ body @entity127 urges people to maintain a healthy diet , including foods that boost good bacteria and encourage efficient digestion			0
this may have an especially positive effect on mood disorders such as anxiety and depression			0
they recommend eating plenty of fibre and probiotics such as live yogurt , as well as limiting sugar , processed foods , animal fat and the use of antibiotics , antacids and anti-inflammatories , as these cause imbalances in the gut .			2
