by @entity0 @entity2 consumption of wine or spirits increases the risk of the heart condition atrial fibrillation drinking just one glass of wine a day could trigger a stroke , heart failure or dementia , researchers have warned			1
@entity2 consumption of wine or spirits - defined as between one and three drinks a day - increased the risk of an irregular heartbeat , known as atrial fibrillation ( @entity20 )			1
the condition is one of the most common heart rhythm problems and significantly raises the risk of stroke			2
this is because when the upper chambers of the heart do not pump efficiently , as in atrial fibrillation , there is a risk of blood clots forming			1
in extreme cases , @entity20 can cause heart failure and has also been linked to @entity36 's disease by reducing blood flow to the brain			2
the researchers say that while many studies have shown that light to moderate drinking can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke , it is important to balance these benefits against the potential risk of developing @entity20 the study , of almost 80,000 people in @entity51 , found those who indulged in moderate consumption of wine and liquor , were more likely to develop the condition			1
however the research , published in the @entity56 , did not identify a similar association beer - even when people binged on it			0
researcher professor @entity60 , of the @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ' we have no explanation for the lack of association with beer consumption			0
' it is likely beer is consumed more regularly during the week , whereas wine and liquor are more often consumed only at the weekend			0
' she added it might be possible to reverse the damage by spreading out alcohol consumption over the week , rather than drinking a lot in one go			0
the study , which tracked the food and alcohol consumption of middle - aged and elderly people over 12 years , found the more people drank on a single occasion , the higher the risk of @entity20 atrial fibrillation causes a fast and irregular heartbeat , usually over 100 beats a minute			1
other symptoms include dizziness , breathlessness and tiredness previous research has also shown a link between heavy drinking and abnormal heart patterns			0
an international study carried out over 12 years tested nearly 37,000 women and found that those who drank the equivalent of 14 alcoholic units a week - the maximum intake for women according to @entity101 guidelines - were 60 per cent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation			2
the most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is becoming aware of a fast and irregular heartbeat ( palpitations ) , usually over 100 beats a minute			1
other symptoms include dizziness , breathlessness , chest pain ( angina ) and tiredness .			0

condition , known as atrial fibrillation , can cause stroke and heart failure
