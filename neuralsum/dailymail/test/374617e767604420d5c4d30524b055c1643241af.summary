from the moment i set foot on my terrace overlooking the scenic @entity5 to the divine meal i ate at its @entity8 - starred restaurant , @entity0 played a wonderful trick on me			1
the five - star hotel in @entity11 celebrates all things wine - port wine , in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades - old tradition , with a prime location , classic design and unblemished attention to detail			1
but , to my surprise , @entity0 has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar			1
in those five years it has been hitting all the right notes , developing a reputation as a haven for wine lovers and one of @entity34 ’s best luxury hotels			0
the @entity36 suite at @entity0 boasts a high - vaulted wooden ceiling , copper @entity38 , fireplace and a rotating bed @entity34 's first wine hotel is built into a hill , providing sweeping views of @entity11 and the @entity5 from the indoor pool and guest rooms when guests arrive at @entity0 they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of @entity36 , the @entity52 god of wine for guests like myself , who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste , it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque @entity5 region ’s nectar			1
even though the hotel is dedicated to wine , it ’s not just for enthusiasts			0
regardless of their knowledge or palate , guests can take advantage of two other things that the @entity0 specialises in : relaxation and imaginative food			2
when i arrived on a friday night i stepped into the immaculate lobby - accentuated with a statue of @entity36 , the @entity52 god of wine - to the sound of an acoustic guitar drifting from @entity76 , the in - house bar where couples canoodle on couches and bartenders mix port wine cocktails			0
with more than 80 wines by the glass it is the only bar in @entity11 to remain open 24 hours a day			0
public spaces inside the five - star hotel , including the lobby and @entity76 , offer a breathtaking view of @entity90 's second - largest city the @entity0 is located in @entity91 ; it is separated from @entity11 by the @entity5 , which spills into the @entity93 the @entity0 's large decanter - shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun from the statue of @entity36 , guests ’ attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the @entity107 , which links @entity11 and @entity91			1
guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace , which has impressive views across the river of @entity90 ’s second - largest city			1
the @entity0 , @entity34 ’s first luxury wine hotel , is built into a hill in @entity91 , with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a @entity90 winery			1

owned by @entity139 , which owns the hotel , the compound offers informative tours and tastings , with visitors learning about the history of the sweet wine and the @entity152 of @entity139 ’s , which is in its fourth century			0
after the tour guests are offered three port wines - chip dry ( extra dry white ) , late bottled vintage and 10 - year - old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium port wines			0
my tour included a stop inside one of the cellars , which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres			0
located next door to @entity0 , @entity139 's port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors my superior room , themed after the @entity176 do @entity174 winery , was decorated with its labelled bottles , photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts , plus vintage - like furniture and lime green curtains , giving it a luxurious but laid - back feel			1
like the rooms , each floor has a theme			0
floor one , where the outdoor pool is located , is decorated with framed maps of @entity34 , while other floors focus on local history or @entity90 discoveries			0
wine is front and centre at this polished hotel , owned by centuries - old port wine producer @entity139 , but one could argue that the real star of the show is the @entity202			2
the restaurant at @entity0 is the only one in @entity11 to carry a @entity8 star , offering exceptional service and creative dishes tasting menus include dishes such as crispy suckling pig belly ( pictured ) , and codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree it is the only restaurant in @entity11 to carry a @entity8 star , and during my visit i was treated to a two - hour culinary masterclass with exceptional service and creative dishes from start to finish			2
the tasting menu included a langoustine broth with crunchy langoustine and @entity226 sauce , roasted codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree , crispy suckling pig belly with cardinal prawn slices and herb sprouts , and a chocolate cafe with toffee and caramel ice cream - all paired with @entity90 wines			2

from the spa to the restaurant and everywhere in between , everything at @entity0 comes back to wine , with the hotel acting as an ambassador			2
one of the features that should delight anyone with an appreciation for it is a ‘ working cellar ’ on the lower level open two hours every day , guests can head down with a sommelier to pick out a wine - from @entity90 or another wine - producing nation - to pair with their dinner			1
after my two - night stay at @entity0 i still consider myself a novice when it comes to the finer points of wine , but i left feeling confident that there will be fewer surprises the next time i pick up a bottle at the supermarket			2
