mounds of sand spotted in the @entity3 desert using @entity4 might be the site of long - lost pyramids			1
@entity8 archaeology researcher @entity7 pinpointed two areas along the @entity11 basin , 90 miles apart , both containing unusual shaped mounds last year			1
there was resistance by other archaeologists about whether her find was indeed that of unknown pyramids but now a preliminary ground study using ancient maps suggest that the location might , in fact , be correct			1
antique maps support @entity31 's claims and a preliminary ground study of a site , pictured , close to the @entity11 has revealed cavities and shafts as well as north - facing tunnels @entity7 made her discovery at home in @entity39 last year after combing images on @entity4 for a decade			1
she added that intriguing features including cavities and shafts have now been uncovered in a preliminary exhibition to the site , which is 12 miles from the city of @entity46 along the @entity11			1
the site includes a 620ft - wide triangular plateau that 's almost three times the size of the @entity49 at @entity28			1
if it is genuine , it could be the largest pyramid ever discovered			0
she has also discovered that the formations are labelled as pyramids on a number of rare , antique maps , @entity52 reported			1
@entity7 's extraordinary claim attracted criticism from a number of archaeological and geological authorities who were skeptical that a tool like @entity4 could lead to a real discovery			1
they reportedly dismissed the unusual mounds as anomalies or windswept rock formations that are common in the desert			2
the mounds discovered by @entity7 are listed as pyramids on 34 antique maps owned by @entity73 , former ambassador to the @entity74 of @entity75 and his wife @entity76 , a former counselor of the @entity3 presidency , pictured years ago archaeologists reportedly tried to dig on one of the mounds , pictured , but struck hard stone that lead researcher @entity82 thinks might have been granite @entity7 said : ' after the buzz simmered down , i was contacted by an @entity3 couple who claimed to have important historical references for both sites			1
' @entity90 collectors of maps , @entity73 , former ambassador to the @entity74 of @entity75 and his wife @entity76 , a former counselor of the @entity3 presidency , said that the formations spotted by @entity7 were labelled as pyramids in several of their antique documents and maps			1
they told @entity52 they have 34 maps and 12 documents written by scientists and officials that support @entity7 's claims			1
the archaeologist also identified a second group of possible pyramids near the @entity106 and three maps have since been identified to suggest that the four mounds hide ancient treasures			2
this photo was taken of a hole that was dug by the locals around the site of the mysterious sandy mounds			2
the site is believed to be haunted with several stories claiming the area contains ' great magic ' one of the maps was drawn by an engineer of @entity121			2
the couple said : ' they would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind			0
' we would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the pyramids of @entity28 '			2
their documents suggest that the pyramids at @entity130 were deliberately buried in a bid to strike them from memory , however the site has not yer been investigated by archeologists			0
however , @entity82 , who led the preliminary expedition to the site near @entity46 said the mounds are made of different layers not belonging the the surrounding landscape , suggesting that they were indeed made by @entity3 deliberately trying to bury a structure			1
he told @entity142 that local people living near the mounds have suspected that they harbour ancient secrets for a while			0
as well as the larger mounds , the expedition team believes the site also features a temple or row of tombs next to the the mounds			0
they are shown in the red rectangle on this image created using false colour imaging technique developed by @entity7 years ago they reportedly tried to dig on one of the mounds but struck hard stone that @entity162 thinks might be granite			2
mr @entity82 said : ' what made us sure those mounds are hiding pyramids was a special cavity and metal detector we used over the mounds			0
' he said that the detector revealed an underground tunnel pointing north on both the big mounds , which is hopeful as most known @entity3 pyramids have north - facing entrances			1
@entity7 reportedly said that the @entity3 team thinks they have identified a temple close to the site and a row of possible tombs			1
to finance the exploration of the two mysterious sites , @entity7 has set up the @entity183 and started a crowd funding campaign			0
she hopes to journey to @entity3 with a team of @entity8 scientists to prove if the sites she found on her computer are indeed those of ancient pyramid complexes			1
vast : the giant triangular plateau near @entity192 is three times the size of the great pyramid of @entity28 smaller mounds found by ms @entity7 still measure up to 330 feet across @entity7 's ' second site ' has four - sided ' pyramidal area ' , surrounded by further raised mounds if the site , 12 miles from the city of @entity46 , does include the remains of a genuine pyramid , it would be the largest ever discovered			1
the discovery was made by archeological researcher @entity7 , from @entity39 just after her discovery last year , @entity7 said : ' upon closer examination of the formation , this mound appears to have a very flat top and a curiously symmetrical triangular shape that has been heavily eroded with time			1
' the second site , 90 miles north , contains a four - sided shape that 's 140ft wide			0
' it has a distinct square centre , which is very unusual for a mound of this size and it almost seems pyramidal when seen from above , ' ms @entity7 said			2
speaking to @entity218 last year , she added that there were also three smaller mounds : similar to the diagonal alignment of the @entity223 pyramids			0
' the images speak for themselves			0
it 's very obvious what the sites may contain , but field research is needed to verify they are , in fact , pyramids			0
' both sites are significant because almost all the known pyramids were built around @entity233 and these sites are much further south			0
it 's not the first archeological breakthrough to have been made thanks to @entity4 - in may two years ago @entity8 egyptologist dr @entity237 identified 17 lost pyramids			2
and @entity7 herself has used the program to discover a possible underwater city off the @entity242 in @entity243			0
pyramids were first built in @entity3 in the 28th century @entity245 as tombs for the nation 's @entity247			2
the most famous @entity3 pyramids are those found at @entity28 , on the outskirts of @entity233			1
vast and elaborate structures they took many years and up to 100,000 workers to construct			0
to date there are 138 known pyramids in @entity3			2
@entity257 - the first stone pyramid was built at @entity259 , just south of @entity28 , for the pharaoh djoser			0
unlike the later pyramids , it was made by building layers of stone on top of each other , so it resembled a set of steps			0
@entity270 of @entity28 was built as a tomb for the @entity272 ( @entity272 )			0
standing 147 metres hihg and weighing an estimated 6,500,000 tonnes , it 's the largest ever discovered			0
2575 - 2150bc - the golden age of pyramids			0
hundreds were constructed around @entity233			0
the new discovery is significant because almost all the 138 known pyramids are located near @entity233			0
ms @entity7 's pyramid sites are much further south			1
almost all the 138 known pyramids are located around @entity28 , in the outskirts of @entity233			2
ms @entity7 finds are far further south , near @entity130 and @entity162 square mound : a 150ft - wide truncated mound that ms @entity7 located near the ancient and abandoned town of @entity286 the @entity49 of @entity28 , centre , is the largest known pyramid and one of the seven wonders of the world			1

@entity293 mounds discovered by an @entity8 scientist in the @entity3 desert are labelled as pyramids on 34 rare , antique maps
archaeology researcher @entity7 's find was dismissed by many but a preliminary ground study has found shafts and cavities
one site spotted on *satellite* is three times the size of @entity49 at @entity28
