chairman of the 1922 committee @entity1 is among those supporting the campaign for a new generation of grammar schools senior conservative mps will next week challenge @entity7 to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools			1
the chairman of the influential 1922 committee , @entity1 , and former leadership contender @entity14 are among those supporting the campaign , the @entity13 has learned			1
at present , the law forbids new grammar schools , whose intake is based on selection according to academic ability - only allowing existing institutions to open ‘ satellites ’ in new locations			1
@entity28 , the home secretary , and @entity30 , the defence secretary , have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies			0
the option is being attempted by conservative councillors in @entity37 , where @entity40 of @entity37 girls ’ grammar school in @entity39 has applied to open a site nine miles away in @entity43			0
but a poll this week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them , such as petitions in support			1
@entity51 , founder of @entity52 , the party pressure group which is behind the new campaign , said : ‘ we want to ensure that in the @entity57 manifesto there is a clear commitment to reverse the legislation preventing the creation of new grammar schools			1
‘ our followers are strongly of the opinion that new grammar schools will both enhance social mobility and present parents with choice , both of which lie at the heart of the @entity57 ’s values			1
’ mr @entity1 , a former frontbencher , said the closure of selective grammars ‘ is one of the things which is building a less cohesive society ’			0
mr @entity14 , the former shadow home secretary , said : ‘ they [ grammar schools ] are still a motor for social mobility but nothing like as good as it used to be			1
that is all down to , i am afraid , a massive failure in public policy , a massive failure in confidence in high quality education for bright kids			0
’ @entity88 and @entity89 mp @entity89 , a member of the @entity90 , said : ‘ there ’s no silver bullet to reviving stagnant social mobility in @entity94			0
but grammar schools are a key piece of the policy jigsaw , creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard - working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters			1
’ research for @entity52 found 84 per cent of people said that grammar schools are a valuable asset to the @entity94 education system			2
some 80 per cent believe that grammar schools make the education system fairer			2
home secretary @entity28 ( left ) and defence secretary @entity30 ( right ) have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11 + exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed			0
@entity7 has long resisted calls to pledge to expand selective schooling in the @entity57 manifesto			0
the architects of the coalition ’s school reforms hoped that controversy over grammar schools in the party could be put to rest by focusing on all - ability academies and free schools			2
in the 1970s , @entity134 - herself a grammar school girl - allowed local councils to decide themselves whether their schools should remain selective grammars when she was the education secretary			0
it proved to be a political misjudgment , since many councils took the opportunity to end selective state education			0
there are now around 160 grammar schools left in @entity144 – mostly in the home counties .			2
