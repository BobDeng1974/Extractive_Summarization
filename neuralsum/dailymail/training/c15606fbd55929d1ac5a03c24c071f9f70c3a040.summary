@entity1 's sister @entity10 , now 52 , had @entity0 with her now - husband @entity11 , also 52 , when they were 25 years old , but they did n't get married until 2006 , 18 years after @entity0 's birth			1
' the tabloids are telling the truth , my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock , ' @entity0 wrote in a lengthy post on @entity22 on tuesday , along with a photo of her with her parents			1
' i 'm sure [ my mom ] was scared , young , ridiculed , and felt ashamed			1
just because i share the @entity1 name does n't mean my life is perfect ! ' @entity42 knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow i would be part of it			2
he knew my parents story would be told			0
' @entity0 also remarked that ' everyone sins differently ' but that ' @entity49 paid for it all '			2
she then gushed over her parents , saying : ' i 'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life ' , and , ' i 'm also grateful that i have such an awesome relationship with my dad ! seriously he 's the greatest !

' happy accident ? of her mother ( right ) , @entity0 ( left ) wrote , ' i 'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life ' when the news was initially broken last week by @entity67 , there was speculation that @entity11 might not be @entity0 's biological father , since @entity11 said in a 2012 interview that he and @entity10 had been dating for 20 years , which would have been five years after @entity0 was born			1
it seems , however , that this was simply a miscalculation on @entity11 's part			1
in a 2009 interview on @entity8 , @entity10 said : ' @entity11 and i knew each other a long time ago , and i got pregnant with @entity0			1
and so , we dated each other on and off for quite some time			0
' then we finally decided you know what , we need to get married ! so we got married , we ’ve been together three years			0
' getting it off her chest : in the post ( pictured ) , @entity0 insists , ' just because i share the @entity1 name does n't mean my life is perfect !

' the tabloids are telling the truth , my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock			2
just because we are @entity37 does n't make us perfect , it just makes us forgiven			0

but @entity49 paid it all ! ! i 'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life			0
i 'm sure she was scared , young , ridiculed , and felt ashamed			2
@entity42 's grace covered it though ! she 's beautiful inside and out			0
i 'm also grateful that i have such an awesome relationship with my dad ! seriously he 's the greatest ! @entity49 , thank you for restoring hearts , relationships and families			0
no matter what you have done , do n't think your a second you 're alone in this world			0
@entity49 died so that you may be free ! @entity151 : 16 ' indeed , only yesterday @entity0 posted a snap of herself chatting with her five - year - old cousin @entity92 , @entity1 and @entity155 's youngest child , on @entity91			1
' face timing the family tonight ! # allsmiles @ duggarfam ' , she captioned the image			0
@entity0 's confession comes hot on the heels on rumors that @entity1 and @entity155 once banned their midwife daughter @entity101 from helping a member of their extended family , because she too got pregnant out of wedlock			1
this allegation concerns @entity103 , the 22 - year - old younger sister of @entity105 , 23 , who is married to @entity1 and @entity155 's oldest son @entity168			1
when @entity103 give birth to her first child two years ago , @entity101 was apparently forbidden from helping by her strict parents because they did n't want her fraternizing with an unwed mother - to - be			1
' @entity101 was very excited to assist @entity103 through the birth , ' a source told @entity67			1
' @entity155 and @entity1 , however , would n't let her participate			1
they thought @entity101 should n't be exposed to an unmarried mother in that condition			2
' the @entity8 are well known for following a hardline @entity178 sect known as the @entity180 movement , which promotes procreation and eschews all forms of birth control			0
another recent scandal involves the recent revelation that @entity155 has a sister who is a lesbian			2
@entity155 has never said much of the woman , @entity187 , who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner , but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult			2
we are worried about them , ’ @entity187 's partner @entity195 told @entity198 in 2010			0
‘ we have often thought that @entity180 is a cult			0
it appears to be brainwashing to me			0
