@entity7 's tiny body shut down after catching a cold sore virus from @entity9			1
he spent six weeks on a life - support machine , but doctors were unable to save him and he died aged just two months			1
kiss of death : baby @entity7 died after contracting a cold virus which he caught when he was given a loving kiss by his father @entity9 ( right ) , his mother @entity18 - @entity18 ( left ) has revealed ' his heart broke in two ' : @entity9 and @entity21 were devastated to find out that their baby had been struck down by a virus from his father 's kiss his parents were shocked to discover their baby had been struck down with the herpes simplex virus , a disease carried by most of the population , but usually lies dormant			1
@entity31 - @entity18 , 28 , said : ' i asked how it was possible for a baby to have herpes ? ' when he said it was transmitted via the cold sore virus i looked at @entity9 and he instinctively touched his lip			1
in that moment i saw his heart break in two			2
' @entity9 just broke down			1
he was totally distraught and kept saying he blamed himself			1
' but i never once blamed @entity9			1
all he had ever done was shower our baby with love and affection			2
he had been the perfect father			2
i hated seeing him punish himself			0
' ' distraught ' : @entity9 feels that if he had never gone near his son ' he 'd still be here today ' vulnerable : @entity7 was born five weeks premature on march 28 @entity9 , 34 , a painter and decorator from @entity50 , @entity51 , said : ' i blame myself but i had no idea			1
' obviously if i had i would n't have gone near him and he 'd still be here today			0
' @entity21 was thrilled to discover she was expecting a son in august 2011			1
@entity7 was born five weeks prematurely on march 28 last year			1
@entity21 said : ‘ we were smitten with him			1
he looked the image of his daddy with a shock of dark hair and blue eyes			0
' it was our dream come true to be home together as a family			0
’ they doted on @entity7 and each night after his bath would spend time kissing and cuddling him before laying him down to sleep in his moses basket next to their bed where @entity21 would sing him off to sleep			1
heartbreaking : @entity7 spent six weeks on a life - support machine , but doctors were unable to save him campaigning : @entity21 , pictured ( left ) with @entity7 in hospital and is expecting again ( right ) , is calling on the government to raise more awareness of the dangers of cold sores for babies cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus ( @entity82 ) , which is carried by most people , but usually lies dormant			1
it can be caught through physical contact , such as kissing or even breastfeeding			0
while most adults carry the virus without any health risks , it can be fatal for babies because of their poor immunity			2
those in the first six weeks of life are most at risk			0
while the virus can be notoriously hard to detect , early signs include a baby not feeding , drowsiness , fever , floppiness and unusual crying			1
the @entity100 recommends that anyone with a cold sore or symptoms of an impending outbreak should avoid kissing a baby as @entity82 is most virulent when the skin is broken			1
but when he just over two weeks old , he sent his parents into blind panic when he suddenly turned blue after refusing to take his bottle			0
@entity21 said : ' i was n’t too worried at first , but when i tried again later he grizzled and moaned so i kept a close eye on him			1
’ she ’d just noticed a slight temperature when suddenly @entity7 turned blue and stopped breathing			2
' pure panic hit , i just screamed at @entity9 to call an ambulance , ’ she says			2
paramedics arrived within minutes and rushed the family to @entity117 in @entity118 where @entity7 was taken straight into resuscitation			2
@entity21 said : ' there were doctors everywhere all frantically working on him			2
i kept asking them what was wrong , what had happened to my baby ? but nobody knew			2
' when they took me to see him he was on a ventilator covered in tubes and wires and i just broke down			0
' he looked so tiny			0
i could n’t believe this had happened so quickly , he ’d been fine the night before			0
i kept thinking it was an awful nightmare and that i ’d wake up			0
’ the parents kept vigil at his bedside but just 48 hours later consultants warned he was unlikely to survive and urged them to consider switching of the ventilator			0
' a consultant told us his brain was that swollen he was unlikely to pull through			0
it did n’t make sense that i ’d given birth to a perfect baby and now i was being told to let him go before i even knew what was wrong with him			2
’ desperate : @entity9 pleaded with doctors to do everything they could , but after six weeks on life - support @entity7 started to suffer seizures and his parents were gently asked to consider switching the machine off @entity9 said : ' i pleaded with them to do something else , he was only two weeks old			1
we could n’t give up			0
’ after six weeks in hospital @entity7 still could n't breathe for himself and when he started suffering seizures @entity21 and @entity9 were gently asked to consider having the machine switched off			1
she said : ‘ we were told there was no hope and as a mother you want to protect your baby from suffering so we made the hardest decision of our lives			2
' we gave permission for the permission to be switched off so he could go to sleep			0
he was handed to me and i cuddled him and held him as he slipped away			0
' i kissed him and told him how much i loved him and how good it felt to hold him in my arms again as he fell asleep for the last time			0
’ @entity7 was just eight weeks old when he slipped away on may 24th last year			2
the hospital was obliged to inform the police the illness was unexplained			0
but no charges were brought after the death was confirmed as a tragic accident			0
they wrote to the health secretary calling for more information to be given to expectant mums and started an e petition for hospitals to include facts about the virus on leaflets given to new parents			0
now @entity21 is eight months pregnant and due to give birth to a baby girl next month			1
she said : ' she is our reason to live again			0
but i will never get over losing my son @entity7			1
' he would have been a fantastic big brother if he had n’t been taken by a kiss			0
no baby should ever die because of a kiss			1
