it ended as it started , in celebratory mood			0
at times , it might have seemed like a lacklustre party full of curmudgeons and killjoys refusing to enter into the spirit			0
but eventually the guests did get into the swing of things to produce an evening of lukewarm revelry , even if they had to be prodded into action			0
@entity13 had led @entity14 out on the occasion on his 100th cap with his sons @entity18 alongside him and @entity19 in his arms			1
and sir @entity21 presented him a special cap embroidered with gold thread in honour of his landmark			2
and yet once the formalities were over , it was as though no - one quite knew just what kind of an occasion this was			0
it required a degree of swagger and joy and yet it threatened to be a dour and forgettable affair			0
@entity13 leaps in the air after equalising from the penalty spot on his 100th appearance for @entity14 @entity42 defender @entity41 ( c ) congratulates @entity43 after the captain scores his 44th international goal @entity48 scores the second of his two goals as @entity14 maintain their perfect qualifying record with a 3 - 1 victory @entity14 players come together after @entity48 gives them the lead for the first time in the game @entity14 : @entity55 6 , @entity56 7 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 5 , @entity60 7.5 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 6 ) , @entity48 8 , @entity43 7.5 , @entity63 7.5 ( @entity64 )			1

and they completely disrupted the running order when they took the lead though that at least sparked @entity14 into some action , with @entity43 himself was forced to take the initiative , winning and converting a penalty before @entity48 ’s two goals put the game out of @entity76 ’s reach and ensure that @entity14 ’s steady march to @entity123 continues unimpeded and that @entity43 would at least end the game happily			1
‘ it was a wonderful evening for him , ’ said his manager @entity125 afterwards			0
‘ it must have been special to have the cap presented by sir @entity21			0
and then to give a good performance and cap that by scoring the important first goal			1
it put us right back in the game after their goal against the run of play - but we were good value for our victory and good value for our three goals			1
’ they were by the end			0
but after a dreadful first half , you did rather wonder whether anyone was in the mood to celebrate			0
it certainly was n’t a stage fit for international royalty			0
the pitch looked an utter mess after the @entity154 series of matches			0
it could not explain @entity14 ’s first - half performance , allowing the game to be played at a pace which suited @entity76			1
possession is all well and good , but means little without intent			0
@entity14 had settled for the safety of the sideways pass there were occasional flurries of quality			1
a pass here , a run there ; they always ended with a woeful finish or a poor final ball			0
their best early moment came on 21 minutes when @entity60 looked up and picked out @entity48 with a raking , lofted ball from deep			1
he chested the ball down perfectly for @entity13 , but the centurion shot wildly high and wide			1
@entity178 , who guided his nation to major tournaments in 2000 and 2002 , had a clear game plan and his players did not waver early on			0
yet they were no innocents abroad ; @entity82 crunched into @entity61 and later @entity80 gave the @entity184 player a sly elbow in the face , before proffering apologies			1
a red card would not have been amiss that said , @entity14 ’s willingness to collude with @entity192 needs was depressing			2
they simply could not create any intensity			0
indeed , @entity90 went close heading wide from a corner and @entity76 most worrisome first - half moment came when @entity83 attempted an unnecessary back pass which had goalkeeper @entity77 scrambling			1
at least that gave the @entity109 crowd something to cheer			2
there had been precious little else , so their reaction at half time was extraordinarily benign : a rippling of applause			0
better performances than this have seen @entity14 subjected to a cascade of boos : either crowds have grown up , or expectations have been managed down			2
@entity43 warms up at @entity109 wearing specially designed boots to commemorate his 100th @entity14 cap @entity43 was awarded a glass cased commemorative ' gold cap ' by @entity217 legend sir @entity21 @entity14 supporters at @entity109 show their appreciation for the @entity217 striker 's landmark occasion @entity222 makes sure that @entity43 's youngest son @entity19 ( @entity224 ) does n't wander off during the presentation @entity43 's proud wife @entity226 takes pictures from the @entity109 stands to remember the occasion @entity43 is given an early chance to add to his 43 international goals but his first touch lets him down @entity63 ( r ) is challenged for the ball by @entity76 defender @entity83 as @entity14 control possession the @entity184 forward uses his lightning pace to stretch the @entity76 defence during the first - half @entity14 keeper @entity55 takes a goal kick as @entity14 start competently against @entity76 at @entity109 @entity241 full back @entity56 ( @entity224 ) impresses on his first start for @entity14 with an industrious performance on the right @entity76 captain @entity80 was fortunate not to be sent off after appearing to elbow @entity61 in the face @entity61 falls to the ground after receiving an elbow from @entity76 captain @entity80 towards the end of the first - half @entity88 of @entity76 looks down as he walks past @entity61 following the elbow incident @entity60 bravely confronts the significantly taller @entity80 after the @entity76 captain 's elbow on @entity14 teammate @entity61 @entity14 did improve and @entity125 must take credit			1
there is more flexibility about this team			0
‘ we had two systems of play up our sleeves because we did n't know how the pitch would play , ’ said @entity125			0
‘ @entity48 went slightly wider , @entity63 sent slightly wider , we kept our three in the middle , and it worked well			2
@entity48 profited strongly from that and we saw a better @entity63			2
’ indeed they did but not before @entity76 had startled @entity14 on 56 minutes			1
@entity265 sent in a superb curling crossed free kick			0
@entity59 rose to make an impact but unfortunately ended up flicking an arching header over his own goalkeeper to score : a striker could not have been more proud			2
@entity76 though were undone by their own stupidity , retaining their lead for less than a minute			2
@entity43 seemed ready to them on all alone			2
@entity279 by @entity60 , he burst into the box , causing consternation , though in reality , he was heading nowhere dangerous when @entity80 panicked and felled him			2
a penalty awarded , @entity109 chanted for their 100 - cap man and he did not disappoint , fairly blasting the spot kick into the corner to the right of @entity77 , who , to his enormous credit , got a strong hand to it			1
in scoring , @entity43 moved on to 44 @entity14 goals , level with @entity295			1
@entity14 were a good deal more comfortable on 66 minutes when @entity61 executed a lovely turn to engineer a cross which was deflected by @entity80 into goalkeeper @entity77 , forcing him to clear unsatisfactorily			1
the ball was eventually headed out to @entity48 who , despite falling backwards and being unable to make clean contact , did enough to direct it through a crowded penalty area to make it 2 - 1			1
the game finally slipped away from @entity76 on 74 minutes , when @entity63 and @entity48 exchanged passes with the @entity309 man left to take a touch and drive a clean finish past @entity77 for 3 - 1 , his fifth goal for @entity14 in four games			1
by then it was hard to remember the dismal start we had endured to the evening			0
but then again , all the best parties save their best for the finale			0
groundsmen tend to the pitch at half - time after an @entity154 game between the @entity324 and @entity325 had left it in a state @entity327 defender @entity57 ( r ) forces a save from the @entity76 keeper after the interval @entity59 ( c ) gives @entity331 an unexpected lead after heading into his own goal from a free - kick @entity59 's header sails into the corner to concede @entity14 's first goal in their qualifying campaign @entity43 uses power to smash home the penalty and level the scores at 1 - 1 within minutes of conceding @entity43 celebrates after bringing his side immediately back into the game following @entity59 's unfortunate own goal the @entity14 captain wheels away with a clenched fist after leading by example to get @entity14 back into the game @entity43 clasps his hands together towards the sky after scoring from the penalty spot @entity48 's shot hits the ground before beating the keeper to give @entity14 the lead for the first time @entity48 is congratulated by @entity309 teammate @entity58 and @entity43 as his @entity14 scoring streak continues @entity14 teammates congratulate @entity48 after the striker gives them the lead with a scuffed second - half strike @entity48 completes his brace to put @entity14 3 - 1 up and retain their place at the top of qualifying @entity367 former @entity217 star @entity48 watches the ball home for his fifth goal in his last four @entity14 games @entity309 teammate @entity58 races to congratulate @entity48 as @entity14 take a step closer to the @entity123 finals @entity43 shakes hands with @entity80 after the final but the @entity14 captain did not want to swap his special shirt			1
