the traditional elevator has had its day			0
more than 160 years since cables and hoists were used on the very first lift systems in buildings , engineers have designed an alternative that uses magnets			0
the setup uses magnetic levitation , or maglev , to pull elevator cabins horizontally as well as vertically quickly and smoothly			0
the firm believes it will transform how people move inside buildings			1
each of the cabins are self - propelled using a multi-level brake system			1
they transfer power from the shaft to the cabin using a magnetised coil running along the shaft called @entity13 , the technology has been developed by @entity15			1
it is reminiscent of the floating glass elevator seen in the 1971 film @entity30 , based on @entity32 's book			0
the @entity34 - based firm believes @entity13 will transform how people move inside buildings , reduce waiting times for passengers , and take up less space			1
each of the cabins are self - propelled using a multi-level brake system and transfer power from the shaft to the cabin and back again			1
a magnetised coil running along the elevator shaft repels magnets on the outside of the cabins			1
this allows the cabins to levitate above this so - called guideway			1
power is then moved along the coils in the guideway to pull and push the cabin up and down , or left and right			0
this current changes to accommodate differences in polarity needed to keep the cabins in motion and moving in the correct direction			0
a magnetised coil running along the elevator shaft repels magnets on the outside of the @entity62 allows the cabins to levitate above this so - called guideway			1
the technology is currently used to propel maglev trains ( pictured ) in @entity65 capable of reaching speeds of up to 310mph ( 498km/h ) this causes a magnetic field in front of the cabin to pull it forward , while a field at the rear adds thrust			0
because the cabins do n’t touch the guideway , there is less friction meaning the ride is faster and smoother , and can also reduce energy			0

power is then moved along the coils in the guideway to pull and push the cabin up and down , or left and right the cabins do n’t touch the guideway , so there is less friction and the ride is faster and smoother			2
@entity15 said that ideal building height for @entity13 installations starts at 985ft ( 300 metres ) , but it can be fitted to smaller constructions			2
it will be tested in a tower ( pictured ) in @entity110 , @entity34 in 2016 this causes a magnetic field in front of the cabin to pull it forward , while a field at the rear adds thrust			1

‘ building design will no longer be limited by the height or vertical alignment of elevator shafts , opening possibilities to architects and building developers they have never imagined possible , ’ said @entity15 executive @entity124			0
‘ as the nature of building constructions evolve , it is also necessary to adapt elevator systems to better suit the requirements of buildings and high volumes of passengers			0
‘ from the one dimensional vertical arrangement to a two dimensional horizontal and vertical arrangement with more than one or two cabins operating in each shaft , @entity13 represents a proud moment in @entity15 ’s history of presenting cutting - edge transport technologies			2
’ when running on a loop , the @entity13 has a targeted speed of 16ft ( five metres ) per second , meaning passengers would only need to wait for a cabin for up to 30 seconds			2
it will be officially tested in a tower in @entity110 , @entity34			2
this tower is set to be completed at the end of 2016 , and until then the firm is testing prototypes at its @entity155 headquarters .			2

called @entity13 , the technology has been developed by @entity15
the firm believes @entity13 will transform how people move inside buildings
it will also reduce waiting times for passengers and take up less space
each of the cabins would be self - propelled using a multi-level brake system
they would transfer power from the shaft to the cabin and back again
a magnetised coil running along the shaft repels magnets on the cabins
this allows the cabins to levitate above this so - called guideway
it will be tested in a tower in @entity110 , @entity34 set to be completed in 2016
