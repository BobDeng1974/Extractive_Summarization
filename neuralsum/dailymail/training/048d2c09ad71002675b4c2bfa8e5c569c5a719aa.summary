@entity5 clenched his fist in delight and no little relief after responding to doubts over his @entity11 future with a thumping strike which completed a one - sided afternoon at @entity13			1
manager @entity14 kept faith with @entity16 despite considering his fellow @entity18 low on confidence after touching the ball only 13 times in the previous game at @entity23			1
it proved to be an astute decision as @entity5 set up @entity11 ’s second goal for strike partner @entity27 , then turned @entity29 defender @entity28 to score a great goal himself midway through the second half			1
and when he was substituted four minutes later , he received a standing ovation from the @entity11 fans , and applauded them back			1
it was a satisfying return to form for the player and his team showed that they are warming to their task under @entity40			0
afterwards , the striker who is seen as vulnerable if @entity11 buy big again next summer , admitted that finding the back of the net had been a huge relief , particularly as his manager had described his last performance as ‘ very bad ’			1
‘ i needed that goal , to be honest , ’ he said			0
‘ we played really well , you could see that in the way we passed the ball			0
every week it gets quicker and better			0
we could have won 4 - 0 or 5 - 0			0
’ @entity40 was naturally pleased to see his @entity111 captain back in the goals for just the fourth time this season , but he was not going overboard on @entity16 ’s all - round display			2
‘ every striker needs a goal when they have n’t scored for three or four matches , ’ said @entity11 ’s manager			1
‘ i am very pleased and happy with him for his goal , but he can still play better			0
‘ he played no 10 and not no 9 at the beginning of the game			0
when i was forced to put him in a striker ’s position because of the injury to ( @entity128 ) @entity50 , he played better			0
i am pleased he scored and had an influence on the game			0
’ the only downside to an easy win that harked back to sir @entity133 ’s days when the opposition looked scared stiff of @entity11 were the injuries to @entity50 and @entity27			1
@entity50 asked the bench to remove him after 14 minutes having felt a hamstring twinge and will not be risked when @entity11 hope to build on their recent run at home to @entity141 on tuesday night			1
@entity27 , who scored the second goal from @entity16 ’s assist , was left hobbling after an earlier kick on the calf from @entity69 was supplemented by a bang on the knee in stoppage time			1
‘ he has already told me he wants to play against @entity141 , but @entity27 always says that , ’ smiled @entity40			1
‘ we will know in 48 hours			0
’ in contrast , @entity29 were dismal as former @entity13 skipper @entity77 watched from the dug - out in his 700th game as a club @entity154 have lost four on the trot and he admitted : ‘ it was a tough afternoon for us , no doubt about it			1
we made mistakes you ca n’t afford to at a place like this			0
’ @entity11 's @entity38 scores his side 's first goal of the game against @entity29 on saturday @entity38 looks on as the ball creeps over the line despite @entity29 's efforts to stop it from going in at @entity13 @entity38 appeals for his goal to be given by the referee during the match at @entity13 between @entity11 and @entity29 @entity38 is obscured by his jubilant team - mates as he celebrates scoring the first of the afternoon for @entity11 @entity11 gather together to celebrate going 1 - 0 up at @entity13 , a lead they would never use @entity173 miles @entity11 109 67.7 @entity48 90 11.2 7.0 @entity49 90 11.0 6.9 @entity44 90 10.6 6.6 @entity29 108.8 67.6 @entity174 90 11.1 6.9 @entity65 90 10.5 6.6 @entity74 90 10.3 6.4 @entity77 picked five defenders and even that backfired with @entity40 surprisingly claiming afterwards he knew about the visitors ’ tactics in advance			1
‘ we trained for it , to move the ball quicker , ’ he said			0
‘ this is the first match that we have dominated the game from the first minute until the last , in a way that i like			0
’ @entity11 went ahead after 16 minutes but it was the scrappiest of goals			1
@entity74 and @entity62 got in each other ’s way as they challenged @entity49 for @entity27 ’s corner and , after @entity38 ’s initial header had been returned to him by goalkeeper @entity61 , the defender tried his luck again with his right foot from six yards			1
in almost slow motion , @entity61 parried the shot but the ball deflected off his left knee and rolled just over the line , with referee @entity82 pointing to the centre spot after receiving a bleep from goal - line @entity200 proceeded to dominate possession though @entity16 ’s usually trusty left peg let him down from eight yards when he had only @entity61 to beat			0
in terms of the match result , it mattered not a jot			0
@entity40 will have been pleased that his strikers , @entity16 and @entity27 , combined for the killer second goal			2
the pair know each other well — their children are in the same class at school and attend the same birthday parties — but on occasions look like strangers on the pitch			0
this time , in the 42nd minute , the dream team clicked			2
after @entity62 missed a header , @entity16 cushioned a lovely lay - off into @entity27 ’s path and he drilled the ball home low into the corner for his fifth @entity11 goal of the season			1
all that was missing was a @entity16 strike and it arrived after 66 minutes from @entity51 ’s pass			2
he turned @entity28 and fired a rising shot with his favoured left foot into the roof of the net			0
with the game won , @entity53 was sent on for his first action in six weeks but the @entity241 striker was denied a goal when @entity63 blocked his shot between his legs			0
it was an ‘ ouch ’ moment that summed up @entity29 ’s painful afternoon			2
