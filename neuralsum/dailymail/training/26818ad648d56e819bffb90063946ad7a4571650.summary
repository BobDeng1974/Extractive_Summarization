by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 22 july 2013 the owner of a @entity3 bookshop has become the hero of hundreds of @entity6 fans after he snapped up signed copies of her first detective novel			1
the @entity10 ’s calling by @entity11 is topping best - seller lists across the globe since it was revealed that @entity11 is a pseudonym for the @entity16 author , and first editions sell for more than £ 1,000 each			1
shopkeeper @entity18 bought 250 signed copies of the book before the reveal – but instead of making a fortune , he has sold them all at face value : £ 16.99			1
mystery unveiled : @entity6 signed 250 first edition copies of @entity11 as ' @entity11 ' the owner of @entity26 , which specialises in signed first editions , ordered the copies signed by the author , before knowing anything about ‘ his ’ true identity			1
mr @entity18 had been tipped off about @entity11 by a publishing friend and , upon being sent a manuscript copy , asked for signed copies of the book			1
although he was told the author ’s name was a pseudonym , he had no clue that it was @entity6			2
‘ i did ask if the author really was a first timer as it seemed , well , too good , ’ he told @entity41			0
‘ he assured me the writer was a first time detective writer			0

’ out of stock : since the revelation that @entity6 is the author of @entity50 , @entity26 has sold all the remaining copies - at the £ 16.99 cover price upsell : one of the signed copies from @entity55 was sold on @entity56 for over £ 1,750 and unsigned copies go for around £ 1,000 @entity6 was exposed as the author of the @entity10 ’s calling by the wife of one of her lawyers			1
the publisher of @entity11 had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes @entity67 investigator using the pen - name of @entity11			2
however , several online literary sleuth ’s began questioning similarities between @entity6 and @entity11 as well as noting how well the ‘ male ’ author had described women ’s clothes			1
@entity6 was exposed after @entity74 , a mother - of - two posted a message on @entity77 saying it @entity6 , 47 , was the real author			2
she had been told by @entity80 , a partner in @entity6 ’s legal firm @entity81 , who told @entity74 , his wife ’s best friend , in a private conversation			0
@entity6 released a statement saying it had ‘ not been pleasant ’ to spend days wondering how a woman unknown to her could expose a secret ‘ that many of my oldest friends did not know			0
’ finished copies of @entity11 come off the print line today at @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 the novel , @entity11 , which was released in april , tells the story of @entity11 , a war veteran turned private eye , who is investigating the death of a model she added : ‘ to say that i am disappointed is an understatement			2
i had assumed that i could expect total confidentiality from @entity104 , a reputable professional firm , and i feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced			0
’ @entity81 have since apologised			0
