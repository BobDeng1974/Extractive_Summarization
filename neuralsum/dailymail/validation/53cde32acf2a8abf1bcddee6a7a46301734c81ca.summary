@entity1 fans have demanded the club 's remaining board members follow chairman @entity4 out of the @entity6 exit			1
the club confirmed on monday morning that @entity4 had resigned following 16 months turbulent months in charge			1
the 66 - year - old was a deeply unpopular figure with fans but walked before he was pushed out of the club by @entity12 at a general meeting this friday			2
@entity4 ( left ) resigned from @entity1 on monday and fans want @entity14 ( right ) to go too he even sold his 61,000 - share stake in the @entity16 just two hours after his departure was confirmed			1
@entity19 ' exit leaves the @entity6 club with just two directors , chief executive @entity14 and finance director @entity22			1
both can now expect to be swept out of the club when shareholders meet at @entity6 to vote			1
@entity26 resigned his directorship last week in the face of growing fan opposition and the signs are now clear that @entity12 is on the verge of grabbing control of the @entity34 giants			0
now the @entity35 have told @entity14 and @entity22 to accept defeat			1
in a statement containing derogatory comments about @entity4 , @entity22 and @entity14 , the fans group said : ' we are delighted that @entity4 has finally resigned as chairman of @entity1			1
we note that his parting comments are entirely in keeping with his behaviour during his time at the club			0
@entity4 , pictured here in the stands at @entity6 , was a deeply divisive figure amongst supporters ' he will be remembered as one of the most inept and embarrassing chairmen of our wonderful sporting institution			1
' our focus now turns to the remaining directors			0
they should do the right thing , appoint the nominee directors and then follow mr @entity4 out of the door			1
mr @entity22 should have resigned when he made disparaging comments about major shareholders in a meeting with fans			1
he should be suspended and subject to disciplinary procedures after the general meeting			0
' the statement also criticised the process which led to @entity14 ' appointment as chief executive and the board 's threats of legal action against the outgoing representatives of the @entity73			2
the statement described @entity14 ' position as ' untenable '			2
@entity4 sits on a number of company boards - including @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80 - and it is understood he did not want to risk his reputation by being forcibly removed from the @entity6 boardroom			1
supporters want fiace director @entity22 ( second from the right ) to resign as well in his resignation statement , he said : ' i have resigned as chairman of @entity89 plc. i have worked in the @entity90 , the world 's greatest financial centre for decades and enjoyed considerable success			1
' when i was approached about the chairmanship of @entity1 , friends warned me that the world of football has different rules and codes of behaviour			2
i now know that is a gross understatement			0
' i am a non-confrontational man and have always tried to bring harmony to boardrooms and with stakeholders			0
' at the risk of antagonising my army of critics i would point out that @entity1 managed to pay its bills and avoid going under during my tenure			0
' these critics might not agree with how we achieved this			0
i look forward to alternative solutions from whoever is running the club in the future			0
' despite the personal attacks on me from various sources i genuinely wish the club the very best in the future and i am confident that with such a passionate and vociferous fan base they will be restored to their former glories			0
' the chartered accountant was appointed to his @entity16 role just weeks ahead of the club 's @entity129 in december 2013			0
but it was his performance in front of last year 's shareholder summit which saw him heckled by furious shareholders			0
@entity12 has won his battle for control of @entity1 and wants to rid the club of @entity14 and @entity22 responding to the flak coming from the @entity6 stands , he said : ' when you are chairman of @entity1 , you can do it your way			1
' @entity4 also took over executive duties for a short spell at the end of october after @entity146 quit as chief executive in protest at @entity150 's growing influence at the club			2
but he caused further outrage when a leaked email appeared to show him threatening to sink the @entity156 owner 's planned loan deal if his place on the board was put in jeopardy by a rival Â£ 16million bid lodged by @entity12			0
the @entity162 - based former oldco director was rebuffed at that point but the stage has now been set for him to return to @entity34 and claim the chairmanship from @entity166			0
he needs to win a majority vote on friday to oust @entity150 's boardroom appointments @entity14 and @entity22 from the club , and if successful plans to replace them with former blue knight @entity172 , @entity175 brewery boss @entity174 and himself			1
the @entity177 - born millionaire already holds 14.57 per cent of the club 's shares , while the @entity180 - @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 - are in control of another combined 19.49 per cent			0
the @entity35 has been collecting shares and proxies from minor shareholders - with former manager @entity189 the latest to gift control of his stake - along with fellow fans group @entity192 but with @entity4 and @entity194 both making a run for it , victory appears inevitable			2
@entity4 ' predecessor @entity146 quit in protest at @entity150 's growing influence at the club			2

@entity4 resigned from his position as @entity1 chairman on monday
@entity4 ' exit leaves the @entity6 club with just two directors
but @entity1 fans want @entity14 and @entity22 to go too
