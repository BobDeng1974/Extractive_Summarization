mediocre players from overseas are taking places in club squads that should be going to young @entity6 players , @entity1 chairman @entity0 has claimed			1
the @entity1 has announced proposals to cut the number of players from outside the @entity10 coming into the @entity6 game by up to 50 per cent , including banning clubs sending such players out on loan , preventing @entity16 clubs from signing them and making the appeals process much tougher			1
some 122 overseas players were granted visas between 2009 and 2013 , 23 of them in the @entity16			2
young @entity6 players like @entity21 ( pictured ) are suffering due to the amount of foreign imports , says @entity1 chairman @entity0 @entity0 ( left ) believes @entity26 and @entity16 squads are getting crammed full of foreign players @entity0 told @entity28 : ' everyone recognises the present system is bust			1
' the rules say elite @entity34 players - the very best - should be allowed to come in and we agree with that			2
' what we are saying is there are a lot that are n't ( the very best ) , that do n't play that much and do take squad places and a lot particularly in the @entity16 disappear after a year or so			0
the system does n't work at the moment			0
' what we are saying is " let the best players come in but give the rest of those squad places to young @entity6 kids "			1
' we still have the problem of good kids aged 17 and 18 and they are not getting enough competitive football so we are still looking at how we improve that position			0
' the proposals are part of a number of changes recommended by @entity0 's @entity56			1
he said he would make further announcements in october on plans to improve grassroots facilities and coaches			0
@entity56 captain @entity62 progressed to national standard after being given his chance at @entity65 @entity0 ( pictured ) wants to see a 50 per cent drop in foreign imports to @entity56 in coming seasons the proposals on @entity71 players would also mean only players from the top 50 - ranked countries in the world could be signed unless the transfer fee is more than a fixed figure , either £ 10million or £ 15million			1
the issue of a fixed transfer fee is likely to be opposed however , as some players would be available for free if they are at the end of their contract			0
the ruling would apply to all players from @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , the @entity88 , and @entity89 who do not hold @entity10 passports			1
the @entity1 will now hold talks with the @entity26 , @entity16 , @entity92 , @entity93 and the national fas of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
@entity0 said he expected the other stakeholders to come up with their own proposals			2
he added : ' i think they will come up with other ideas			0
everyone recognises the present system is bust			0
so they will look at it and come up with some ideas and we will look at them			0
' a @entity16 spokesman said : ' we will consider the consultation before responding in due course			0
' @entity114 is one of the players who would not have been eligible to play in @entity56 under these rules @entity56 manager @entity117 wants to have a greater pool of players from which to choose his squad			2

@entity1 chairman @entity0 announces proposals to cut number to players from outside @entity10 coming into @entity6 game by up to 50 per cent
