the @entity0 were accused last night of using public money to garner votes after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of places to benefit from a new fuel subsidy will be in their own seats			1
treasury chief secretary @entity8 said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme – funded by the @entity14 taxpayer – was signed off by the @entity15			1
but 14 are in @entity0 seats , including two in mr @entity8 ’s own constituency in the @entity19			1
@entity20 suggested there should be an inquiry into so - called ‘ pork barrel politics ’ by the @entity0 , who also boast of channelling cash for roads and schools to their own seats			1
mr @entity8 , mp for @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , has faced repeated claims that he is shoring up votes in his seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere			1
in the past , cash has been found for a tax break for ski lifts , a bailout for a sleeper train from @entity42 to @entity43 and green levies scrapped for a tourist train in the @entity46			0
in january , @entity47 announced plans for a £ 300million ‘ city deal ’ for @entity28 , including £ 2million to promote @entity50 and its mythical monster to tourists			0
shadow treasury chief secretary @entity54 suggested the deals should be investigated by the commons public accounts committee to see if they represent value for money			0
at the pumps : treasury chief secretary @entity8 said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme – funded by the @entity14 taxpayer – was signed off by the @entity15 mr @entity54 said : ‘ while i ’m sure there are many living in rural areas who would love a fuel duty cut , it seems more than a coincidence that this is largely restricted to @entity8 ’s backyard and those of his small band of @entity0 colleagues			1
‘ taken together with the very convenient tax break for his local ski lift , there ’s something very fishy about these decisions , and perhaps the public accounts committee ought to investigate			0
’ @entity47 has promised to create a @entity82 in a bid to shore up his party ’s vote in the county			0
the deputy prime minister ( right ) made the pledge as he yesterday embarked on a tour of the key @entity0 battleground			2
the party is desperately trying to avoid a wipeout in the county where it once held all six seats			0
currently , three of the area ’s mps are @entity0			2
mr @entity47 said that he would create a @entity82 , similar to that in @entity99 , which could allow the @entity100 to choose different rules to the rest of @entity103 in areas potentially relating to second home ownership and bus services			2
but the plans dismissed as ‘ ill - considered ’ and a ‘ nonsense ’ by @entity100 nationalists			0
mr @entity47 said : ‘ when the @entity82 is born , it would be up to those who are elected to shape @entity113 ’s destiny			0
' we could change planning law and council tax so buying up second homes in @entity113 comes with a greater price			0
’ nine areas benefiting from the new ‘ rural fuel rebate ’ are in the @entity122 constituency of former @entity0 leader @entity123 who is facing a desperate fight with the @entity126 to hang on to his seat			1
two are in mr @entity8 ’s seat , and another two are in the constituency of his @entity0 neighbour @entity131			1
another beneficiary is @entity133 , @entity134 , in the constituency of former @entity0 defence minister sir @entity136 , and one of only four seats in @entity103 to benefit			1
others are in @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
mr @entity8 said the move will help up to 125,000 people in areas faced with some of the highest fuel prices in the country			1
it is the first time the @entity149 has approved a fuel discount for people living on the @entity14 mainland			2
currently , islanders off the coast of @entity43 and in the @entity155 are eligible for a 5p discount on petrol and diesel because the cost of transporting fuel there means pump prices are much higher			0
the scheme will be extended to 17 mainland areas at the end of may			2
a source close to mr @entity8 denied the scheme was designed to favour @entity0 seats			1
he said the selection process had been ‘ evidence - based ’			0
‘ this is testament to how hard @entity8 has fought and campaigned on this issue over many years , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity8 represents a rural community with many remote areas and so he knows first - hand the extra financial burden this puts on families and businesses facing high fuel costs while relying on cars to travel long distances			1

@entity8 says 17 rural areas will benefit from drop in fuel duty
@entity15 signs off scheme funded by @entity14 taxpayers
14 are in @entity0 seats , including two in mr @entity8 *'s* constituency
@entity20 suggests there should be an inquiry into ' pork barrel politics '
