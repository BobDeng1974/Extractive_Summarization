by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 20:46 est , 14 february 2013 disgraced police chief @entity1 yesterday lost his appeal against his convictions for framing an innocent man for assault			1
the 50 - year - old former @entity7 commander had tried to get his three - year prison sentence for corruption overturned by claiming he was the ‘ victim of a sophisticated witch - hunt ’			1
but three judges at the @entity13 unanimously upheld a jury ’s decision last year that @entity1 had framed an innocent man , @entity17 , in a row over money			1
former @entity20 commander @entity1 with his wife at @entity22 on wednesday , where he had tried to appeal his three year prison sentence his disgraceful behaviour has been repeatedly exposed by the @entity26 which , since 2001 , has chronicled how timid @entity7 chiefs appeased his appalling behaviour , endless threats of legal action and even strikes by fellow race militants			1
at one stage , @entity1 was considered more powerful than the @entity33 - such was the stranglehold he held over his supposed superiors			2
the swaggering playboy , who loved to play the race card to intimidate critics , has been tried and convicted twice over the charges			0
@entity1 , dubbed a ‘ criminal in uniform ’ , was first found guilty in february 2010 after a jury decided that he was lying when he claimed mr @entity43 had threatened him and assaulted him outside a west @entity45 restaurant in july 2008			1
but he was freed from prison , where he was serving a four year sentence , in may 2011 after the @entity13 quashed the convictions because his victim had failed to tell the truth about his immigration status			2
@entity1 had claimed that he was threatened and assaulted by @entity17 in a row over money , but a jury decided he was lying at a retrial at @entity22 last year the officer was once again found guilty of misconduct and perverting the course of justice			1
he was then jailed for three years , but released on an electronic tag two weeks later because he had spent 15 months in prison as a result of his first conviction			0
in the latest appeal , @entity1 ’s lawyer , @entity64 , @entity65 , argued that the conviction was ‘ unsafe ’			1
he said that the judge at the second trial had made an ‘ error of law ’ when he refused to admit certain ‘ bad character ’ evidence relating to mr @entity43			0
mr @entity64 argued that because of the judge ’s decision to reject the application the jury ‘ did not have all the material that it should have done ’			2
he told the court : ‘ we submit simply that that decision was wrong - that the reasons he gave for refusing to allow this material to be deployed were matters which more properly should have been considered by the jury			2
’ opposing the appeal , @entity87 , @entity65 , for the @entity88 , told the court : ‘ here there was no error by the judge in the exercise he undertook			0
the decision was not wrong in law			0
’ a jury decided that @entity98 , pictured , had been framed by @entity1 after a row outside a @entity45 restaurant mr @entity87 said : ‘ we submit that in the context of the fairness of this trial , that this trial remained entirely fair and that the conviction was not unsafe			1
’ dismissing the appeal , the lord chief justice , lord judge , sitting with mr justice @entity107 and mr @entity108 , ruled that the conviction was ‘ safe ’			0

after winning a retrial but still to clear his name , he was reinstated , quickly suspended on full pay and then awarded up to £ 180,000 in back pay and allowances as he awaited the new hearing			0
his salary was stopped on the day he was convicted again			0
@entity1 , of @entity123 , west @entity45 , has emerged unscathed from a series of inquiries over the years which cost @entity7 around £ 4million			1
