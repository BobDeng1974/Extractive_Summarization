by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 18:31 est , 7 november 2012 the new breast - checking glove is said to be as effective as traditional breast cancer screening in detecting lumps women are being warned not to rely on a £ 25 glove claimed to be as effective as a mammogram at detecting signs of breast cancer			1
the manufacturers of the @entity10 say it makes detecting lumps much easier during self - examination because it increases finger sensitivity			1
but breast cancer charities are telling women not to put their faith in the product , saying evidence of its effectiveness is limited			2
the warning comes only weeks after an advertising watchdog criticised an £ 86 ‘ breast torch ’ that manufacturers said could act as an ‘ early breast - screening device ’			2
the glove is being publicised in the @entity27 after clinical tests in @entity29 showed it allowed women to detect the same number of lumps as a mammogram			2
its manufacturer , @entity35 , says the ultra-thin polyurethane glove magnifies finger sensitivity 15 times , making it easier for women to feel hard areas in their breasts			0
but @entity44 , of @entity45 , said : ‘ evidence that devices of this nature can improve detection of breast tumours is very limited , so we urge women not to use tools such as the @entity10 as a substitute for mammograms or for being breast - aware			1
‘ we encourage all women to check their breasts regularly , know what is normal for them and discuss any concerns with their gp			0
’ @entity61 , of @entity62 , said : ‘ it is important that women are not misled when it comes to checking their breasts			0
we do not advocate the use of these gloves and we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these			0
the best way for women to be breast - aware is to know their own breasts			2
’ the @entity10 is said to work by reducing friction on the skin , stopping lumps being pushed away by the fingers			1
a clinical study by professor @entity82 , a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the @entity84 , compared women doing self - examinations with their bare hands with those using the glove			0
the company behind the glove says it could help the millions of @entity27 women who have no idea how to perform breast self - examination those given the glove detected the same number of lumps as were identified by mammography , according to @entity35			1
women using their bare hands found only 50 per cent of the lumps revealed by breast screening			1
official guidelines advise women to carry out breast self - examinations each month , but a survey by @entity35 showed most check themselves only two to three times a year , and 55 per cent did not know the right way to look for lumps			1
@entity110 spokesman @entity109 said : ‘ at the age when women should include breast self - examinations as an essential part of their routine in taking care of their health , it is staggering to see that 55 per cent do not know what they are doing			0
‘ whilst we know that nine out of ten lumps found in the breast are not cancerous , it is extremely important for women to check their breasts regularly , so it becomes part of their routine			2
’ last month the @entity131 ruled that marketing of the @entity134 torch device was ‘ misleading ’ and ‘ irresponsible ’			0
cancer charities said they feared women were using the torches as a substitute for breast screening and getting ‘ false reassurance ’			0
everyone ’s breasts are different , altering with age and at different times of the month			0
look for changes that are unusual for you , such as : lumps or thickening of breast tissue continuous pain one breast becoming larger or lower @entity152 or dimpling of the skin nipples becoming inverted ( turned in ) , changing shape or position developing a rash , crusting or producing discharge from the nipples swelling under the armpit or around the collarbone continuous pain in the armpits source : @entity45			1
