photographer @entity0 had been dreaming of capturing the @entity1 for four years			1
he finally persuaded a group of skier friends to join him on a risky mission to ski down the snow - capped @entity5 , in @entity7 , as the spectacular show glimmered above them			1
@entity0 and friends , @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 , travelled for six days to reach @entity14 in @entity15 , braving avalanches and sub zero temperatures			1
the off - piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the @entity1 in @entity7			1
they were unperturbed , and remained dedicated to their mission to slalom under the natural light show			2
professional ski and mountain bike photogragher @entity0 , 24 , said : ' we all wanted to make the trip happen , and @entity11 and i had talked about trying to capture the single photograph of the @entity1 and a skier			2
' we spent a total of six days on the slopes , from leaving our truck to arriving back at it			0
' the moment was very unusual and mesmerising			0
' it was difficult to concentrate on a specific task when such a beautiful thing is happening above you			0
' the photographer has been skiing since his parents taught him at the age of four , and it has since become a massive part of his life			0
all the skiing conditions on the mission were off - piste , and in avalanche conditions , up the high mountains			1
the team braved avalanche and harsh weather conditions but @entity0 fulfilled his four - year wish to capture the @entity1 in @entity7 friends @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 spent six days with @entity0 traversing the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity7 to witness the natural disco in its magnificence , you have to head north towards the @entity78 , above latitude 60 degrees the cause of the stunning @entity1 is solar wind interacting with the @entity83 's magnetic field , creating the beautiful , natural light show			1
the electrically charged particles are drawn to the @entity83 's poles and their colours are a result of the different gases in the atmosphere			0
in the northern hemisphere they are known as the aurora borealis , and many tourists flock to witness the ethereal display , despite the often high cost and cold temperatures			0
the mysterious show also occurs in the southern hemisphere , the aurora australis , its main audience being the penguins			0
@entity0 said : ' i love to create images that last in a person 's head , and i think about it for a long time before i capture it			2
' so , a single shot like the northern lights will always be special			0
' the northern lights are caused by solar wind interacting with the @entity83 's magnetic field , creating the beautiful light show the skiers spent a total of six days on the slopes , braving sub-zero temperatures to view the @entity1 in action @entity0 said : ' i love to create images that last in a person 's head , and i think about it for a long time before i capture it			2
' so , a single shot like the northern lights will always be special ' dangerous conditions ! the group were not put off by the off - piste , dangerous mountain landscape , and completed their mission to ski under the magical light show			1
