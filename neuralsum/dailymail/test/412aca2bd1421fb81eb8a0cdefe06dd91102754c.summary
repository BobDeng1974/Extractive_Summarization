model @entity0 may benefit from the right to buy scheme being extended to housing association tenants as her mother plans to buy her a property housing association tenants paying cheap rent to live in homes worth millions could get the chance to buy them at discounted prices under new right - to - buy plans			1
a number of people are currently paying around £ 150 a week to live in flats in exclusive parts of @entity18 and @entity19 in @entity20 which are owned by housing associations and are now worth several million			1
under @entity24 plans to give tenants the chance to own their own homes , people living in these plush properties could now get the chance to buy them with discounts of up to £ 102,000 in @entity20 , after living in them for cheaper rents			1
the properties form part of affordable housing because of agreements with developers to provide low - cost provisions when new developments are built over a certain size			1
many of them were built years ago in areas which have now become expensive and are worth millions of pounds			0
this enables tenants to occupy properties worth at least £ 1million for cheap rents , and many tenancies go unreviewed if circumstances change			1
however the value of the housing stock has raised questions over whether they should be sold to fund more housing			0
an investigation by the @entity54 found that 10 properties owned by the @entity57 housing association in @entity20 are located in the expensive areas of @entity18 and @entity19 - and are worth between £ 1million and £ 2.2million			1
the house used in the recent @entity61 film , in @entity62 , is also owned as affordable housing			2
@entity64 , who lives in one of the @entity57 flats in @entity67 , told the newspaper she plans to buy her property for her pregnant daughter , @entity0 , a model based in @entity72			2
under plans proposed by the conservatives the right to buy will be extended to 1.3million homes , occupied by 2.75million people			0
it is aimed at giving more people the opportunity to own their own homes and every house sold will be replaced on a one - for - one basis			2
but @entity88 have opposed the proposals to sell their costly buildings at discounted prices , saying it will mean while individual tenants may benefit there will be no affordable housing left for people who need it most			1
housing associations own expensive properties , such as a house used in the @entity61 film in @entity62 @entity61 was filmed in an exclusive part of @entity62 , a property owned by a housing association they have also said owning property which has recently risen in value allows them to finance future developments			1
@entity111 director @entity110 recently branded the scheme the ' wrong ' solution to the housing crisis			0
she said : ' halfway through a programme of austerity and in the grips of a housing crisis , if you had £ 20 billion of taxpayers ' money , would you just give it away as a gift to some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents ? ' the original right - to - buy scheme saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates , and became one of @entity133 's best known policies			1
at the moment housing associations , which receive public money and loans to provide affordable housing , are exempt from the scheme			2
around 800,000 people have a ' limited right to acquire ' , and are eligible for maximum discounts of £ 16,000			0
some tenants who are currently paying around £ 150 a week to live in the expensive @entity20 districts are keen to take advantage of the right - to - buy plans to try and buy their properties			1
however some insist even with the discount of up to £ 102,000 in @entity20 they will still be unable to buy their homes			2
how does right - to - buy work ? introduced in 1980 , it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home			1
@entity154 dropped its opposition to the policy but , in 1999 , @entity158 's government cut the top discount from £ 50,000 to £ 38,000 and sales slowed			0
what has the coalition done ? it has sought to reinvigorate the scheme , cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £ 77,000 for most areas			2
are housing association tenants covered ? housing associations – autonomous , not - for - profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low - cost homes – are largely exempt			1
however , around 800,000 ha tenants have a limited ' right to acquire ' with discounts capped at between £ 9,000 to £ 16,000			2
the other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy			0
what are the @entity24 proposals ? they would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right - to - buy			1
tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount , increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant			0
those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount , going up 2 per cent every year			0
discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £ 102,700 in @entity20 and £ 77,000 across the rest of @entity196			2
how will this be paid for ? the @entity197 say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant			0
council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off			0
around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year , because tenants die or move			0
the sell - off could net £ 4.5billion a year			0
what about the proceeds ? they will be split , with a proportion used to replace on a ' one - to - one ' basis the council homes sold off			0
the new properties would be more affordable , probably in less expensive locations , and could be built either by a council or housing association			1
another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right - to - buy discounts for housing association tenants			1
the rest would go to create a £ 1billion fund , enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing			0
it would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land , and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years , @entity197 say .			0

housing association tenants are paying £ 150 a week to live in £ 1m homes
properties are owned by associations as part of affordable housing pledge
new right - to - buy legislation could see tenants able to purchase homes
they will be offered discounts to buy their properties , giving an extra benefit to those who currently occupy flats in @entity18 for cheap rents
