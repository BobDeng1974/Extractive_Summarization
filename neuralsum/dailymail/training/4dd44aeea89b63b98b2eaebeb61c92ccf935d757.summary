’ sgt @entity125 of @entity126 said today : ‘ @entity14 was reckless in several ways on the evening of the collision			0
‘ he was more than twice over the drink drive limit , and this may have led to him turning across the path of the oncoming vehicle believing he could get through the junction			2
‘ that he did n’t kill anyone else in the collision is down to two reasons ; the actions of the public who dragged @entity14 , his rear seat passenger , and @entity8 from the burning @entity64 , and the fact that the family in the @entity60 were correctly seated and belted			1
‘ the woman injured was in a critical condition and still needs operations			0
