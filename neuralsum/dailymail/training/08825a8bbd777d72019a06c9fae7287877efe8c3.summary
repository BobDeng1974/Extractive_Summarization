a scarcity of lethal injection drugs has forced states to go back to the future to carry out capital punishments			1
@entity5 has brought back the electric chair and both @entity7 and @entity8 are considering the use of firing squads , according to reports			1
@entity14 gov. @entity13 signed a bill into law thursday allowing @entity5 to electrocute death row inmates when prisons are unable to obtain the necessary drugs , the state announced			2
@entity20 return : @entity5 has reintroduced the electric chair as an execution method ( @entity25 's electric chair , located at @entity26 in @entity27 , is pictured ) the drastic measure is just the first of what may be many as @entity32 drug makers are refusing to sell the cocktail of drugs normally used to execute death row inmates			2
@entity5 lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the electric chair legislation in april , with the @entity38 voting 23 - 3 and the @entity39 68 - 13 in favor of the bill			0
the @entity5 is also the first in the nation to bring the electric chair back into use without giving condemned inmates the option of an alternative method , according to @entity49 , the executive director of the @entity50			0
‘ there are states that allow inmates to choose , but it is a very different matter for a state to impose a method like electrocution , ’ he said			2
‘ no other state has gone so far			0
’ @entity49 said he expects legal challenges to arise if the state decides to go through with an electrocution , both on the grounds of whether the state could prove that lethal injection drugs were not obtainable and constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment			1
the electric chairs reintroduction to @entity5 came just as rumblings started in both @entity7 and @entity8 that those states are mulling over whether to bring back sharp shooters to carry out death sentences			1
give them the gas : @entity7 law currently requires inmates to die in a gas chamber similar to this one if no lethal injection drugs are available , but no such facility exists in the state a @entity7 legislative committee has begun drawing up a bill that would allow firing squads to end the life of inmates @entity81 , director of the @entity82 , told members of the @entity85 's @entity84 the state has completely run out of the lethal injection drugs , and suggested an alternate method of executing inmates			1
‘ in the event that we had an execution scheduled and we could n't carry it out as a result of lack of substances , i suggested to the @entity95 that we may want to consider having an alternate means of execution , such as the firing squad , ’ he said			0
laws currently on the books call for the state to execute inmates using a gas chamber should the need arise			1
@entity7 has only one inmate currently on death row – @entity105 , who convicted in 2004 of the brutal 1988 sexual assault and murder of a teenage woman , according to the @entity110			2
a vote will not likely be held on the measure until july , during the state ’s next legislative meeting			0
the answer ? : the execution chamber at the @entity117 is seen after @entity118 was executed by a firing squad in @entity120 june 18 , 2010 @entity14 @entity8 legislator @entity121 is also planning to float the idea later this year of bringing firing squad deaths back to the state			1
‘ it sounds like the @entity126 , but it 's probably the most humane way to kill somebody , ’ said @entity121			0
it has been only four years since the last firing squad death in @entity8 – five police officers used .30 - caliber @entity132 rifles in 2010 to execute convicted murderer @entity118			1
he actually chose to be killed by firing squad rather than lethal injection			1
the state had outlawed it in 2004 but left open the possibility of anyone condemned to a death sentence prior to the ban to have the option , @entity118 took it			2
‘ the prisoner dies instantly , ’ @entity121 insisted			0
it sounds really bad , but the minute the bullet hits your heart , you 're dead			0
’ @entity49 said that if @entity8 brought back firing squads as a default option rather than leaving it up to inmates to choose , as was the practice before 2004 , it could also be challenged in court			1
@entity5 has 74 prisoners on death row and @entity8 has nine , state records showed			0
the @entity160 has never declared a method of execution unconstitutional on the grounds that it is cruel and unusual			0
it upheld the firing squad in 1879 , the electric chair in 1890 and lethal injection in 2008			1
lethal injection is receiving more scrutiny as an execution method , especially after last month 's botched execution in @entity173			1
in the @entity173 case , inmate @entity175 's vein apparently collapsed and he suffered a fatal heart attack 43 minutes after the process began			0
many other states including @entity173 , @entity180 and @entity181 also use lethal injection for the death penalty			2
authorities in those states have also expressed concern about difficulties obtaining the necessary drugs .			0

the states are looking for alternative execution methods as lethal injection drug *supplies* *dry* up
@entity8 *abolished* firing squads in 2004 but last executed a man using one in 2010 because he chose the method prior to it being outlawed
@entity7 law requires a gas chamber to be used should no lethal injection drugs be available - the state has no gas chamber
