@entity0 was a ‘ racist and white supremacist ’ , a @entity1 candidate in next year ’s general election has claimed			1
the war leader ’s grandson sir @entity3 today slammed the ‘ deeply insulting ’ views expressed by @entity6 , who is standing for @entity7 in the @entity9 seat			1
the @entity1 candidate made the outburst on @entity12 , after it was announced that @entity0 would feature on the new £ 5 note			1
he became prime minister again in 1951 , before retiring in 1955 the damning revelation comes after @entity1 was forced to suspend a candidate for claiming @entity18 was @entity20 ’s ‘ @entity19 ’			1
@entity21 , @entity1 's candidate for @entity22 , @entity23 , she would ‘ never forget ’ and make sure her kids knew ‘ how evil @entity20 is ’			2
ms @entity21 was told of her suspension while on her way to the @entity1 conference in @entity28			0
@entity0 ’s grandson sir @entity29 today called for @entity1 leader @entity30 to similarly take action against mr @entity6			1
he told @entity32 : ' the fact that these views are expressed within the @entity1 is deeply insulting to the memory of our greatest prime minister			1
' he added : ‘ @entity30 must take action against those in his party who hold abhorrent views			0
if he ca n't do that he can never be up to the job of being prime minister			1
' mr @entity6 ’s remarks are also in stark contrast to the esteem in which the two - time prime minister is held among the general public			1
in a 2002 @entity51 poll sir @entity0 was voted the @entity52 in history for his role defeating @entity55			2
sir @entity0 led @entity56 between 1940 and 1945 - and again from 1951 to 1955			1
he also served in the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 – while commanding a battalion in the @entity62 after resigning from the @entity63			0
@entity0 is also the only @entity56 prime minister to have won the @entity64 and was granted the rare honour of a state funeral after his death in 1965			1
sir @entity0 's grandson @entity3 attacked the remarks as ' insulting to the memory of our greatest prime minister ' @entity0 served in the @entity57 before going into politics			1
here he is pictured as a hussars officer in 1895 but @entity1 ’s mr @entity6 , who describes his politics as ‘ far left ’ , dismissed the statesman as a ‘ racist ’ who did not deserve to be honoured on the £ 5 note			1
mr @entity6 has also expressed his desire to renationalise the major utilities – including electricity , water and rail			2
@entity0 's critics point to several of his caustic remarks and his handling of the 1943 - 44 @entity88 famine when between one and three million @entity58 died of starvation			2
he derided @entity58 's independence leader @entity90 as a ' half - naked holy man ' and once said : ' i hate @entity58			0
they are a beastly people with a beastly religion			0
' on april 26 he wrote : ‘ @entity96 disappointed @entity0 is on the new £ 5 given he was a racist and white supremacist			1
ca n't go into the future with a foot in the past			0
’ but mr @entity6 's remarks are not his only controversial interventions online			2
he has also called for wage caps - claiming that it is ‘ disgusting ’ for people to be paid £ 100,000 when others are ‘ on the breadline ’			2
his @entity108 account also lists him as a member of the ‘ @entity115 ’ group , raising concerns about his links to the fringe militant group			0
labour leader @entity30 is facing growing trouble from far - left party activists @entity1 ’s own rule book states that ‘ a member of the party who joins and or supports a political organisation other than an official @entity1 group or other unit of the party … shall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member ’			0
mr @entity6 is not the first prominent @entity1 figure to criticise @entity0			1
former @entity1 spin doctor @entity128 was accused of insulting the war leader after suggesting he told worse lies about @entity131 than @entity132 had about the @entity133			0
mr @entity132 ’s former director of communications , said @entity0 used what the @entity136 leader called a ‘ bodyguard of lies ’ to trick @entity18 before the @entity131 in june 1944 – and ‘ lied ’ to mps afterwards to ‘ keep various deceptions going ’			1
@entity128 argued : ‘ if the pollsters were to do a survey , who had a greater commitment to wartime truth , @entity0 in the @entity136 or @entity132 in @entity150 , i think we know what the answer would be			2
it just would n’t be true			0
’ but his assertion was challenged by @entity153 mp colonel @entity152 , who led @entity56 forces in @entity155			2
‘ for @entity128 to suggest that @entity0 was a bigger liar than @entity132 is deeply insulting to the memory of our greatest prime minister , ’ said the @entity157 mp			1
‘ it is absurd to compare the disinformation used by @entity0 to enhance our chance of victory in the @entity136 to @entity132 ’s dodgy dossiers before the @entity133			0
‘ @entity0 exposed the truth about @entity170 rearmament			0
@entity132 , aided by the likes of @entity128 , exaggerated the threat posed by @entity174 ’s weapons			0
‘ @entity56 went to war with @entity55 legally to defend @entity176 and @entity0 used misinformation as part of @entity56 strategy and tactics			2
' the @entity181 used misinformation to drum up public support for a war that was probably illegal			0
’ @entity128 was deeply involved in @entity132 ’s notorious ‘ 45 minutes from doom ’ dossier on the @entity133 in september 2002			0
a few months later , the spin doctor was also associated with a separate so - called ‘ dodgy dossier ’ about @entity174 ’s weapons , which turned out to be a crude copy of out - of - date research			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' this comment does not represent the view of the @entity1			0

@entity6 ' disappointed ' @entity0 was featured on £ 5 note
said honouring ' @entity56 's greatest prime minister ' showed @entity56 stuck in past
the candidate it standing for @entity7 in the @entity9 and @entity204 seat
comes after party suspended candidate for claiming @entity18 was ' @entity208 @entity19 '
