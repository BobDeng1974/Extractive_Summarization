by @entity0 for @entity2 , granddaughter of circus supremo @entity3 and niece to @entity5 , childhood was like growing up in @entity6			1
' i used to think the chimps were my best friends			2
they 'd come to my birthday parties			2
and i 'd play with lions and tigers and polar bears			2
it 's only as an adult that i came to realise just what a great childhood it was			1
' she 's back with @entity5 on a tour that will criss - cross the @entity22 for the rest of the year			1
but any preconceptions of a brash circus veteran , sawdust in her veins , are dispelled in the flesh			1
@entity2 is now the ringmaster of her uncles legendary circus @entity2 , who now takes the role of ringmistress , sounds a bit like @entity34 and looks quite a lot like @entity37 's glamorous elder sister			1
her family 's story is one of fabulous wealth , fierce rivalries and – in @entity43 – a playboy dedicated to the pursuit of famous female flesh			1
@entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and , yes , even @entity50 ( or so it was rumoured ) all had their names linked to the flamboyant showman in the 50s and 60s			1
the story begins in the 1930s when @entity58 , one of 23 children and father to 11 , set up a successful travelling fairground			2
immediately after the war he added a modest circus which quickly went on to eclipse the funfair			2
@entity2 recalls her grandfather with affection			1
@entity5 was known for hosting some of the world 's most glamorous celebrities ' i was 12 when he died but i remember him well			1
he was a big personality and a wonderful grandfather although an extremely old - fashioned , autocratic father			2
he had seven daughters and insisted they were locked up in their caravans by nine o'clock when the funfair was travelling the country			0
' in 1966 , @entity77 collapsed over a cup of tea in his caravan , felled by a fatal heart attack at 72			0
there was no shortage of family members only too happy to carry on plying the famous name , and the three surviving brothers – @entity87 ( @entity2 's father ) , @entity89 and @entity90 – picked up the baton			1
' my father was the impresario , @entity89 was the businessman and @entity3 was the larger - than - life figure who appeared in the show			1
' he was the second @entity43			0
tragically , the first died as a lad following an accident in which a vat of scalding water fell on him			0
' my grandparents ' 11th child was a boy they named @entity106 but he hated it and was soon known as @entity3 , something he changed officially by deed poll when he was older			1
' the second @entity43 quickly became the stuff of legend			0
though it was known to few at the time , he was illiterate , unable to read or write until the day he died			2
he 'd ask his wife @entity115 or only daughter @entity116 to tell him what was on the menu so he could order in a restaurant and then get one or other of them to sign his cheques			0
but all that happened much later			0
@entity3 did n't succumb to marriage until he reached his 40s			1
first , there was the urgent business of sowing as many wild oats as possible			0
a child at the time , @entity2 can still remember rumblings of an affair between her uncle and princess @entity50			1
' she came to see one of the shows , ' she says , ' and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards			1
' she can also recall @entity49 being a frequent visitor			0
' this was the very end of the 50s and she 'd just had her first big hit , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity141			0
i deliberately learnt the words so i could sing them to her			0
she could n't have been nicer to me			0
' @entity2 was her @entity3 's favourite niece , she says			1
' every sunday i 'd go and have a cuddle with him			0
it was entirely innocent , i should add			0
but i do remember one particular sunday trotting over and discovering three girls in his trailer : a blonde , a brunette and a redhead			1
i was little but i felt very indignant			0
clearly he liked having his hands full			0
' princess @entity50 , @entity5 and @entity2 when the @entity50 came to visit the circus @entity43 cut a similar dash in his professional dealings			1
when the costs of touring became prohibitive at the beginning of the 70s , the big tent was folded for the last time and the three brothers bought @entity164 as well as a 100 - room mansion overlooking it			2
the @entity166 still performed charity shows for the @entity168 and presented tv specials every @entity170 and @entity171			0
@entity2 enjoyed a certain notoriety on these tv shows in which she was ringmistress , the first woman to perform such a role and kitted out in fishnet tights , black boots and a red tailcoat			1
' i had quite a following			0
my father used to vet my fan mail in case it contained anything he judged to be unsuitable			0
' @entity3 was dazzled by celebrity			1
@entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 – all became friends of the family ( @entity188 later became godfather to @entity3 's daughter )			1
' princess @entity194 came to see one of the shows and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards ' @entity200 was a regular visitor with the other @entity201 dropping round from time to time			1
after one of @entity204 's concerts in @entity205 , @entity3 invited him out for a drink , impressed so legend has it by the @entity210 's impeccable manners			1
and then there were the @entity212			0
@entity213 of @entity214 loved the circus and would often come to visit			2
although the @entity22 @entity212 were fans of @entity164 – and near neighbours , of course – the relationship suffered a strain after a visit from @entity222 in the 70s			0
the @entity5 brothers had bought a whale , unaware that it was a killer			0
@entity222 phoned one day to ask if he could swim with the newcomer			0
just as the whale was beginning to eye up the heir to the throne , he was hauled out of the water in the nick of time			2
' i do n't think his parents were amused , ' says @entity2			1
' he nearly became the @entity237			0
' @entity2 was heartbroken when the circus folded in 1971			1
' they told me it would only be for a year and that all efforts in the meantime had to go into the safari park			0
but everyone got too comfortable living in bricks , as it 's known , the park was making lots of money and life was much easier than being on the road			2
' for the past two decades she 's mostly performed in circuses in @entity253 and @entity205			2
but when her father , @entity87 , died in 2007 of lung cancer , she returned to the @entity22 to be nearer her mother , @entity256			0
@entity3 had died two years earlier aged 70			1
@entity2 's cousin @entity257 revived the circus in 1993 and now , after nearly four decades , she 's once again back in scarlet tails and high boots , ' but no fishnets these days , ' she says with a smile			1
' the moment i stepped into the ring and said : " ladies and gentlemen , welcome to @entity5 , " it just felt right			2
it was like coming home			0
