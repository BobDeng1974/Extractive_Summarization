@entity0 has been labelled ' @entity2 's dumbest motorist ' after he alerted police to his cannabis farm by trying to burn down a roadside speed camera when @entity0 was caught speeding a second time , he mistakenly thought he would be banned from driving for good			1
so in a bid to escape punishment , he decided to set fire to the speed camera that caught him and destroy all evidence of his crime			1
but mr @entity0 , 46 , who has now been described as ‘ @entity2 ’s dumbest motorist ’ , was caught in the act by another camera nearby which led police directly to his door			1
and that was not the end of the nightclub doorman ’s plight			1
when police arrived at his home , they found he was guilty of a second , equally serious crime			1
to their amazement they discovered mr @entity0 was also keeping a secret cannabis farm in his basement			1
the bungling motorist had inadvertently alerted police to two crimes in his unsuccessful attempt to destroy evidence of another			2
and to make matters worse , it later emerged that he in fact would likely not have received any points on his license and therefore would n’t have faced a driving ban as he thought			1
he has now been sentenced to two years in prison at @entity42 after admitting arson and producing cannabis and possessing the drug with intent to supply			2
mr @entity0 , from @entity48 in @entity49 , believed he already had six penalty points on his licence , was caught speeding on the @entity52 near @entity53 , in @entity54 , on 21 february , as he made his way to work			1
that evening he convinced himself he would receive another six points on his licence and would therefore no longer be able to drive			2
around 36 hours after he was caught - 8mph over the 60mph limit - he placed several tyres underneath the camera with an accelerant , set them alight and destroyed the camera			1
the heat from the burning tyres caused £ 12,000 worth of damage to the infrastructure of the camera and police spent a further £ 12,000 on installing a replacement			2
@entity0 set fire to the camera because he wrongly feared he would be banned from driving if he took the points @entity73 , prosecuting , said that mr @entity0 only realised the futility of the arson attack during a police interview following his arrest			1
mr @entity73 said : ‘ he made full admissions describing it as something he had done in panic			0
when he was told he would not have lost his licence you can almost audibly hear the sense of self - reproach and the realisation that he had done something stupid			2
’ @entity87 , defending , admitted : ‘ he has not really got an excuse for damaging the camera other than that he was stupid and acted on the spur of the moment			2
police found £ 35,000 worth of cannabis growing in @entity0 's basement			1
file photo ' he was always going to get caught			0
he has always been very remorseful			0
from the start he has always apologised			0
' he did something very serious and now he is paying the price			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s commercial drug operation was capable of producing 3.5kgs of cannabis worth around £ 35,000 when sold on the streets			1
judge @entity104 told him : ‘ you are not the first person to stand before me for setting fire to a speed camera			1
people need to know that anyone who does that will go to prison			0
‘ these speed cameras save lives			0
they moderate people ’s driving			0
this county has the worst roads in @entity119 for death and serious injury			0
that is why we have so many speed cameras			0
' people who set fire to speed cameras must realise the consequences are a hundred times worse than taking the fine			0
a custodial sentence is inevitable			0
’ @entity130 of the @entity131 said : ‘ these things are always done in a moment of madness and people think they will not get caught			0
' the reality is that when a camera is attacked we will always pursue those responsible and we will catch them			0
