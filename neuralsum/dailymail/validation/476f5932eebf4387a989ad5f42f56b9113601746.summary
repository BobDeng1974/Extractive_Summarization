@entity2 's population is up 565,000 in the past three years because of a fresh influx of migrants , experts said yesterday			1
the migrant population in @entity2 is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years , research from the @entity7 has revealed			1
around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other @entity15 countries , the study by the university 's @entity9 said			1
today the former head of the @entity17 taunted @entity18 over this issue and said it was ' impossible ' for @entity21 to reverse the trend			0
here is a regional picture of the total foreign population of @entity2 and the percentage it has risen in since 2011 @entity29 said : ‘ when you have 28 countries it will be impossible to say , let ’s say , the @entity34 can come to @entity21 to work in the @entity35 but the @entity36 can not come to @entity21 – this is not possible			1
this will be a violation of the principles of no discrimination			0
‘ having said that , the @entity15 is very much aware that there is the abuse of social benefits			2
if you have not the means to be in the country , you can not go there just to benefit from the social security			0
‘ but you have the right , if you are a citizen of a @entity50 country to go to another country to establish there			0
’ @entity36 is trying to call its skilled workers home from @entity21			0
ambassador @entity53 said it can not afford to lose its best young people and wants to persuade them to return			0
the @entity36 authorities also hope @entity15 freedom of movement rules will encourage other @entity50 to look for jobs in the country , boosting its economy			2
mr @entity53 said efforts were under way to bring back some of the millions of young @entity36 who left for @entity21 and after @entity36 joined the @entity15 in 2004			2
he told @entity65 : ‘ we have a special programme called @entity68 and the government is trying to attract these people back home			0
‘ we are worried that we may lose some well - educated people , and also skilled workers , because we need them			2
’ but he added : ‘ we have other nationalities in @entity36 ... so this is a kind of free movement of brains			0
’ plea : @entity78 he said as long as the principle of freedom of movement is not called into question , a deal can be reached to restrict migrants ’ benefits			2
the majority moved to @entity88 and the south - east but the north - east and @entity89 and @entity90 saw the biggest percentage increases , figures show			1
every council area of @entity2 has seen an increased migrant population , it was said			1
researchers , who stressed that the numbers are estimates , said the projections give a more up - to - date picture of the migrant populations across @entity2 than the 2011 census			1
it came as the @entity103 found that rising number of migrants has led to council services spending by being cut in half - and those with highest migration numbers were hit hardest			1
official estimates on population are expected in june from the @entity111			0
the greatest increase in the number of foreign - born residents has been in the capital			2
almost 200,000 more migrants were estimated to live in @entity88 last year , compared to 2011			1
the @entity117 saw the second - highest rise of 79,000 , while the smallest increase was in the @entity120 where an extra 26,000 migrants are thought to have arrived since 2011			1
@entity122 , director of the @entity9 , said the study was done to provide more insight ahead of the general election			0
' these data show how different local experiences of migration have been across the @entity21 , ' she said			0
' there are large variations in the size of migrant populations , as well as the share that come from @entity15 countries			2
figures : the study shows how all regions have seen thousands more migrants from within the @entity15 since 2011 embarrassing : despite pledges from @entity18 thousands of migrants from outside the @entity15 also came to @entity2 ' we have undertaken this analysis to provide a resource for anyone looking to understand local demographics of migration in the run - up to the general election			1
' the news piles more pressure on @entity18 , whose promise to curb immigration has been shattered , last week it emerged annual net migration – the measure of how many people have come into @entity21 minus those who have left – has reached nearly 300,000 - a record			1
when he took power in 2010 mr @entity18 pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000			0
a total of 624,000 people migrated to @entity21 in the 12 months up to last september while 327,000 left			0
the inflow is up 94,000 on the year before			0
official figures : last year 300,000 migrants arrived in @entity21 , with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the @entity15 net migration from the @entity15 hit 162,000 in the year ending september 2014 , up from 130,000 in the previous year a total of 37,000 @entity168 and @entity169 arrived in the @entity21 , up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months			1

of the estimated 565,000 increase a third came from outside the @entity15
majority of @entity2 's newest population went to @entity88 and south - east
but north - east , @entity89 and @entity90 say largest percentage increases
