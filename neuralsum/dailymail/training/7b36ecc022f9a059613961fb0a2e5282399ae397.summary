@entity12 mayor @entity11 said the fire also likely destroyed five houses and displaced at least 30 people			1
he said it took firefighters 7 to 8 minutes to get to the scene instead of the usual 3 to 4 minutes because a dispatcher misunderstood a caller			1
but the mayor said that officials do not believe the delay cost lives because the home was already engulfed when the first calls came in			0
tragic : at least four people were killed and five homes destroyed by the fire in @entity12 , @entity6 , thursday mistake : firefighters got to the fire later than they normally would after a misunderstanding with the 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher about the address unfortunate : mayor @entity11 says the delay probably did n't cost lives because the home was already engulfed when the first calls came in ' the calls indicated the house was already engulfed in flames , ' @entity11 said			1
' it was already a multi-alarm fire out of the gate			1
' the fire happened on @entity12 's @entity44 , but the mayor said an initial caller did not specify the street or avenue , and a dispatcher thought the person said ' @entity51 ' instead of ' @entity52			1
' firefighters were routed to @entity54 instead of @entity44			1
' the 911 dispatchers are obviously trained to deal with high - pressure situations , ' @entity11 said			0
' but in the mix - up , the caller did n't distinguish ... you 're dealing with people in the heat of the moment , and it 's hard to get them to answer questions			1
that issue was part of it			0
' the fire swept through part of a block of row houses			2
authorities recovered two bodies by late morning , and brought out two other bodies later in the day			0
authorities had n't released the identities of the dead by thursday afternoon , but neighbors and people who said they knew the family said the victims were a pastor and his wife and children			1
before the bodies were found , the mayor said a couple in their 80s and their two sons , who are in their 50s , were unaccounted for			2
victims : the victims are believed to be a pastor , his wife and the ciouple 's two adult children @entity98 , of @entity12 , and @entity99 , of @entity100 , said pastor @entity101 often held services at his house and also preached in @entity100 and other areas			1
' he was just a likable , lovable guy , ' @entity105 said			0
' this is absolutely devastating			0
it 's a tragic loss for the community			2
' authorities have n't said what they believe caused the fire			1
as stunned neighbors looked on , firefighters used a ladder truck to peer into the second floor of the charred structure			2
a man who lives across the street said he had returned home at about 1 a.m. after celebrating his 40th birthday when he looked out his window to make sure he 'd turned out all the lights in his car			0
homeless : mayor @entity11 says the fire destroyed at least five homes and displaced at least 30 people ' i saw the flames coming out of the first floor entrance , ' @entity129 said			2
' at some point the wind was blowing the fire across the street and into the other houses , and they had to evacuate everybody			0
' video shot by @entity129 appeared to show a man running up to the house and trying to enter as the fire raged , only to be grabbed by police			0
@entity129 said he heard the man shouting , ' my grandmother is in there ! ' @entity11 said the fire broke out during a particularly difficult week for the @entity149			0
a funeral is scheduled for friday for fire captain @entity151 , a 29 - year veteran of the department who also volunteered with the @entity153			0
@entity151 was killed last week after falling from the roof of a burning restaurant in @entity156 .			0

firefighters were given the *wrong* address after a dispatcher misunderstood a caller
the dispatcher thought the person said ' @entity51 ' instead of ' @entity52 , ' where the fire was
the mistake caused firefighters to get there in 7 to 8 minutes rather than the usual 3 to 4
the family killed is believed to be a pastor , his wife and the couple 's two adult children
