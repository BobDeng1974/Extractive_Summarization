when his children brought two goldfish home from the fair in a water - filled plastic bag , @entity0 thought they might survive for a few months			1
but for 35 years , @entity4 and splash proved him wrong … until this week , when @entity6 sadly departed this world for that great big fishbowl in the sky			1
it means splash , believed to be @entity13 ’s oldest living goldfish , is alone for the first time since 1977			2
end of an era : @entity6 ( left ) died on sunday leaving splash ( right ) alone for the first time in 35 years happier times : splish and @entity16 had been companions for more than 35 years after being brought home from a funfair flying solo : splash is now living alone for the first time in more than three decades mr @entity0 , 68 , said : ‘ i found @entity6 floating dead in the bowl			1
splash looks as if he is coping fine and he ’s just swimming around as normal			1
’ ‘ it was actually quite sad to see him go , because we ’d known him for so long ... more than half my lifetime			0
’ he and his wife @entity30 had looked after the two fish ever since their children @entity33 and @entity34 , then aged six and nine , won them at the fair			0
mr @entity0 , a retired human resources consultant from @entity35 , @entity36 , said : ‘ we certainly did n’t expect them to live this long – it ’s incredible			1
the children eventually grew up and left home but splish and @entity16 stayed put with us			2
the kids are in their forties now			0
’ gold oldies : splish and splash had lost some of their gold colouring over the years but were otherwise healthy mr @entity0 said there was no particular secret to their longevity : ‘ we just fed them normal goldfish food , but they have thrived on it			2
’ in the last three or four years they had finally begun to show their age , however , losing their gold colour and turning silver			0
splish and @entity16 shared the same bowl for more than two decades			2
around ten years ago they moved house – into a new tank equipped with a filter , which mr @entity0 nicknamed the ‘ @entity68 ’			0
shocked : @entity0 had expected the fish to live for no more than a few years after winning them at a funfair with his children in 1977 common goldfish normally live for between five and 15 years			1
those kept in small tanks , like @entity4 and splash , are not generally expected to live for more than ten			0
but @entity16 still has a long way to go to beat the world record holder – @entity79 , a goldfish which died at the grand old age of 43 in 2005 .			0

pair were won at a funfair in @entity35 , @entity36 , in 1977
@entity6 passed away last weekend leaving @entity16 alone for first time
owner @entity0 : ' he looks as if he *'s* coping fine '
