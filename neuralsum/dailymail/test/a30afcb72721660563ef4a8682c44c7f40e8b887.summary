a new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis			1
the white - cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south - east @entity9 after researchers set up camera traps			1
the monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area			1
videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in @entity9			1
human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis , but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom			2
an evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species			2
he concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners , or even as a way of cooling the body down			1
the relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist @entity57 in his latest ' @entity59 ? ' video series for the @entity60 , @entity61			0
gorillas have small penises and small testicles , while chimps have medium - sized penises and large testicles			0
by comparison , human males have the longest penis and medium - sized testicles			0
' amazingly the size of the reproductive organs , especially the testicles , are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially , ' explained professor @entity57			0
' why the difference ? well for the testicles it 's pretty straight forward			0
' it all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps , and their sperm , have when they mate with females			0
' but he said there was n't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes			0
dr @entity96 , one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at @entity101 , @entity102 , in @entity20 , said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species			1
he said that due to the remoteness of the location in @entity108 of @entity9 , few biologists had been there			1
he said : ' @entity108 is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science			1
' furthermore , it locates in southeastern @entity9 and close to @entity115 line which is a political sensitive area			1
very few have people studied primates there			0
' this species has long been identified as @entity121 macaque ( @entity120 ) because no clear photos or good specimens are available			1
' in an attempt to better study the animals living in the region , @entity124 , a photographer with the @entity125 in @entity126 , set up camera traps in the area 's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests			2
they captured 685 photos of macaques and mr @entity124 was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images			0
when the researchers , whose work is published in the @entity142 , examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features			0
they the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face			0
they also had long thick hairs on their neck			0
but the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia			0
most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises			1
however , @entity24 had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum			2
scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails ( like those above ) and light coloured markings around their face , leading them to identify a new species of primate the images above show the more usual ' arrow - shaped ' genitalia that macaques in the area have videos also revealed that @entity24 produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by @entity120 as an alarm call			1
dr @entity96 said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres , evergreen broad - leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres			2
however , the researchers , who also included @entity185 from the @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity20 , warned that the new species may be under threat			2
they said : ' the white - cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations			1
the white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of @entity108 in south east @entity9 , @entity20 the researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of @entity24 become paler and more prominent with age			1
infants can be seen in the images a and b while a juvenile is labelled @entity206 females are in the image d and adult males are seen on the far right of image @entity209 have few dark hairs on their faces ' @entity213 of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern @entity9 and calls for more intensive surveys , studies , and environmental protection in this area			1
' dr @entity96 added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area			2
he said : ' this area has been little studied			0
' although primates have been intensively studied for decades , two new macaque species ( @entity227 munzala and @entity229 leucogenys ) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years			1
' as for other species groups that received less attention , we believe there are still some species remain undiscovered			0
' it is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered			0
' @entity238 ( above ) have long hair on their muzzles simiarl to another species @entity241			2

macaca leucogenys long *mistaken* for @entity120 say scientists
new macaque has a distinctive rounded rather than arrow shaped penis
researchers say the remote highland forests of @entity108 , in south east @entity9 , could be hiding many other new species that are waiting to be discovered
they warn new macaque is threatened by hunting and habitat *destruction*
