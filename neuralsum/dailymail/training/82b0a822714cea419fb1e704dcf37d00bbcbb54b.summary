@entity0 , a probable @entity1 presidential candidate , is lending her support to a proposal that would give federal regulators more power over the internet on the eve of a vote to enact the measure			1
commonly referred to as net neutrality , the measure would also ban @entity6 ' fast lanes ' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others			1
federal regulators plan to approve the set of rules on thursday , setting up a years - long battle			1
the ' net neutrality ' rules , which seek to guarantee equal access to all online services , are likely to spark fresh challenges in court and efforts in @entity27 to nullify or revamp the plan			1
the latest attempt by the @entity30 to bring the internet under its control followed public pressure on the independent agency from president @entity35			1
@entity36 , a probable @entity1 presidential candidate , is lending her support to a proposal that would give federal regulators more power over the internet on the eve of a vote to enact the measure critics of the plan , which @entity30 chairman @entity45 , a @entity46 , has refused to release to the public before the vote , and of the @entity35 administration , have argued that president overstepped his authority in trying to influence the regulatory agency 's activity			1
the @entity30 , they said , is poised to inappropriately spread its authority to a communications system @entity27 has n't given it permission to meddle with			2
@entity58 in @entity27 has vowed to investigate the power play , and a @entity58 member of the commission , @entity62 , has warned that the ' secret ' plan will give ' a @entity65 bureaucracy a blank check to decide how internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the internet backbone			2
' @entity36 on tuesday said she believed that her former boss , president @entity35 , was ' right ' to get involved			1
' for the @entity30 to do what they want to do , to try to create net neutrality as the norm , they have to have a hook to hang it on , ' @entity36 said			1
' it ’s a foot in the door , it ’s a value statement , i think the president is right to be upfront and out front on that			0
' a former @entity87 senator , @entity36 said she would vote for net neutrality if she were in a position to ' because as i understand it , it ’s @entity92 with a lot of changes within it , in order to avoid the worst of the utility regulation			1
' @entity45 earlier this month unveiled the plan to regulate broadband internet service providers as ' public utility ' carriers , revamping the agency 's rules struck down by a federal court last year			1
the rulemaking effort elicited an unprecedented four million comments , with passionate arguments on both sides about the importance of ' freedom ' and the need to encourage ' innovation ' and investment			0
the @entity30 's five member board will vote on the proposal on thursday			2
it is comprised of three @entity1 and two republicans , with the head usually coming the president 's party , giving his side more weight even though the agency itself is technically independent			0
the @entity58 commissioners are expected to vote against the net neutrality measures			1
a @entity1 commissioner , set to support the plan , had a change of heart this week and is now lobbying @entity45 to weaken the proposal and eliminate a provision that would give the commission authority over ' broadband subscriber access services			2
' a fact sheet published by the @entity30 says the mandate would give it the ability to interfere with policies put worth by internet providers if the agency believes they are ' not just and reasonable			1
' that includes the existence of so - called @entity6 tolls that slow down the rate at which consumers are able to stream videos on sites like @entity147 , which last year accused @entity148 of purposefully slowing down the pace at which their subscribers could view content			2
if adopted , the ' open internet ' rules would bar ' paid prioritization ' , blocking of legal content or ' throttling			0
' commonly referred to as net neutrality , the measure would ban internet ' fast lanes ' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others			1
federal regulators plan to vote on the rule change on thursday the @entity168 or @entity170 and @entity169 had plans this week to hold hearings on the @entity30 's plans but abruptly cancelled them on wednesday after they say @entity45 refused to testify			1
' we are deeply disappointed in chairman @entity45 ’s decision , ' the committee 's chairs , @entity176 , a @entity177 @entity58 , and @entity178 , a @entity179 @entity58 , said in a statement			0
' as chairman @entity45 pushes forward with plans to regulate the @entity6 , he still refuses to directly answer growing concerns about how the rules were developed , how they are structured , and how they will stand up to judicial scrutiny			0
the @entity58 chided @entity45 for insisting on ' secrecy ' rather than transparency in evaluating the rule change and reminded him that he 'll eventually have to appear before the lawmaking body			0
' chairman @entity45 and the @entity30 are not above @entity27			0
this fight continues as the future of the @entity6 is at stake , ' they wrote			0
meanwhile , net neutrality 's backers continued to cheer @entity45 and his allies on the @entity30 on			1
' this is a big step forward for consumers , ' said @entity201 at the consumer activist lobby @entity202 , which has been pressing for strong net neutrality rules			2
@entity201 said the rules would ensure ' an internet where consumers can go anywhere they want , ' without seeing services or applications blocked for competitive or financial reasons			0
senator @entity210 also welcomed the effort , saying it will ' ban pay - to - play deals that could strangle innovation from startups and small businesses , creating an internet divided between the ' haves ' and the ' have - nots			0
'' @entity30 chairman @entity45 , a @entity46 , has refused to release to the public before the vote			2
he 's also evading @entity27 , accoording to two @entity223 heads			0
they warned him today that he is not above the legislative branch and will have to report to the lawmaking body at some point the ' open internet ' rules , which would become final if adopted by the five - member @entity30 , would bar ' paid prioritization , ' blocking of legal content or ' throttling ' -- slowing a rival service which competes with one backed by the internet provider			1
but critics say the @entity45 plan is heavy - handed , based on a 1934 law aimed at regulating phone companies , and claim it will stifle investment and cost consumers more , because broadband firms would not be able to generate revenue through special deals			0
@entity242 , head of the @entity243 , which represents broadband cable operators , said the @entity30 was moving toward ' onerous regulation and could well depress investment and innovation			0
' @entity242 said the move opens the door to rate regulation despite @entity45 's claim to steer clear of this			0
former @entity30 commissioner @entity252 said the agency faces a difficult legal path trying to classify broadband as a public utility without imposing other regulations imposed on telecom firms			2
' i do n't think the commission has thought this through , ' said @entity252 , who heads the @entity263 's @entity262 of the @entity6			0
by selectively imposing regulations , he said , the @entity30 opens itself up to legal challenges			0
and while @entity30 officials have not released details of the plan , @entity252 said the reclassification will likely mean ' billions of dollars in new fees and taxes ' which would be imposed either at the federal or state level			2
@entity58 commissioner @entity62 tweeted this photo of himself holding the massive set of rules @entity1 on the board of the @entity30 want to slap on internet service providers			0
@entity62 , who has seen and read the proposal , said ' the president 's plan will lead to less competition and leave @entity282 with fewer broadband choices ' the @entity30 move also sparked criticism in the @entity58 - led @entity27 , which has the authority to nullify the rules or pass legislation to reverse some of the mandates			1
@entity290 representative @entity290 , head of the @entity291 , said @entity45 ' overestimates the @entity30 's authority to rewrite our nation 's communications laws ... and ignores the fact that his net neutrality rules almost certainly will be stuck in courts for years over questions of their legality			1
' the @entity30 action comes three months after president @entity35 endorsed a strong net neutrality effort , saying no online service should be forced into a ' slow lane			1
' as a result , some @entity58 are denouncing the @entity30 move as ' the @entity35 plan ' and questioning whether the president unduly sought to influence the independent rulemaking agency			1
@entity30 commission member @entity62 said in a statement that ' the president 's plan will lead to less competition and leave @entity282 with fewer broadband choices , ' describing the effort as an ' approach imposed in @entity317 ' which has led to less private investment			2
some 16,000 websites are endorsing the neutrality effort , in a coalition that includes @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 and online review site @entity325			0
in a blog post , @entity325 said that without @entity30 enforcement of open access , ' the internet could fall victim to entrenched , monopolistic @entity332 and gatekeeper companies who would control when , how , from whom and at what cost you view content online			2
this threatens the very core of @entity282 freedom and values			0
' @entity343 public policy manager @entity342 said the @entity30 rules would guarantee ' the ability for all users to ' innovate without permission '' and ' have important implications for freedom of expression			0

the proposal would give federal regulators more power over the internet
the measure would also ban @entity6 ' fast lanes ' for some content producers while slowing down data arrival time for others
the latest attempt by the @entity30 to bring the internet under its control followed public pressure on the independent agency from the president
