when she declined he grabbed her and dragged her off the path , silencing her screams with punches before raping her on the grass			0
he then stole her mobile phone and fled , leaving the distressed woman to flag down a passing cyclist who called the police			0
@entity37 ’s dna was later discovered on the victim and on a bottle of absinthe , which was recovered from the crime scene			2
he admitted rape and was sentenced to six year in jail at @entity44 and will be deported when he is released			0

' @entity37 is a dangerous man who targeted a lone woman as she was walking to work			0

' it is clear this man should have been deported almost immediately once his asylum plea was rejected			0
' this is a classic example of why we have to sort out the matter as soon as possible			0
' it makes me blooming mad because the thing going through his victim 's mind must have been that he might have killed her - she should n't have had to cope with this trauma			1
' now of course putting him in prison for six years is just going to cost us more money			2
