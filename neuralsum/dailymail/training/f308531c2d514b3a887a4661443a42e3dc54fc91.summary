by @entity0 conjoined twins @entity1 and @entity3 caused quite a stir when they were born in @entity5 , with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations			1
and while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12 - year - olds , who were born joined at the waist , the duo are determined to remain together			1
@entity3 said : ‘ we do n't wish to get separated			1
we will stay like this even when we grow old			1
we want to live as we are			2
they have stunned doctors with their ability to wash , dress and feed themselves			2
a local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them			2
they are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs , hearts and brains			1
@entity3 and @entity18 eat together as both enjoy plates full of rice @entity18 and @entity3 laugh with neighbourhood friends with practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss , including showering , eating , getting dressed and combing each other 's hair			1
they are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split - level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighbouring children			1
@entity1 , who appears to be the weaker of the two twins , said : ‘ we have taught ourselves everything			1
we ride to school on a bicycle and playing cricket is no problem			2
’ they are also talented academics and considered among the top students at their local school , much to the pride of their doting father , @entity70 , 45			2
the labourer , who is married to @entity72 and has five daughters , is very protective of his two sons and will not allow them to leave the village			2
the duo getting ready to go to school - at which they 're two of the best pupils he said : ‘ for everyone it is good fun to watch my children , but only i understand all the problems they have			1
‘ during rainy season it becomes difficult for them to walk and when one wants to sit the other has to lie down			2
‘ but they do n't fight			2
they have similar opinions and if one says he wants to play the other one agrees			2
’ the father - of - seven says he would not let a doctor separate them , even if he had the money and the operation was viable			1
@entity100 , mother of the twins , and father @entity103 , at their family home in @entity105 , about 100 miles from @entity26 the twins ' mother , @entity72 , and her two daughters , in their family home he added : ‘ @entity111 has created them like this so they have to walk like they do			0
they will remain like this			0
i do n't want anything else			0
‘ even if doctors say so , i wo n't get my children separated			0
i have no interest in money			0
i 'm the one who will work hard to nourish them			1
i do n't need any help			0
’ conjoined twins occur when the zygote , the initial cell formed by sexual reproduction , fails to completely separate			0
it is thought to occur in roughly one in every 50,000 births , but just one per cent make it to their first birthday and two - thirds are stillborn			1
photographs of the twins have been shown to dr @entity136 , head of paediatrics at the @entity138 in @entity139 , near @entity140			0
he believes it possible to separate the twins - but with drastic consequences for @entity1			1
while @entity3 would likely keep both legs and could start living a more normal life - @entity1 would be left with no legs and needing full - time care			1
the twins use their hands to walk on the village road the operation would also be very expensive and require long - term rehabilitation , both physically and psychologically			1
‘ this operation is possible , ’ he said			0
‘ but there are questions whether we should			0
‘ what would we gain and what we will lose ? what does the family want , how will society take it and , most importantly , how will these two kids take it ? ‘ they appear to be fairly well - adjusted from the photographs and it seems the organs are working really well			1
‘ they have two different brains , two different hearts and two different lungs			0
so as far as physically living is concerned , they can go on like this			0
‘ they appear bright enough to start thinking of becoming financially , economically and physically independent			0
keen learners : the twins studying on a mat at their home ‘ they may even be able to get married			0
there are cases on record where such a thing has happened where conjoined twins have had two different wives and 21 children			0
’ while the twins and their father are adamant they will not be parted , dr @entity136 believes their will may change over time			0
he added : ‘ they are 12 years old now and they must see others running around as individuals and being separate mentally and physically			1
‘ how much they are motivated to be like the others is what we would have to try and assist			0
’ @entity1 and @entity3 's case bares hallmarks to the famous conjoined twins @entity199 and @entity200 from @entity201 , @entity5			1
@entity199 and @entity200 made a living performing as @entity203 in the @entity204 , earning £ 26 a night			0
the pair are believed to now be in their mid- 40s and are both married to a carnival worker named @entity209 .			0

@entity1 and @entity3 were born in @entity5 joined at the waist
the 12 - year - olds said ' we will stay like this even when we grow old '
