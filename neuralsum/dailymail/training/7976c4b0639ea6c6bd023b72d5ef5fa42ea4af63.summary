by @entity0 a 13 - year - old girl who 's recently won high praise and widespread media attention for her breakthrough ecological research stole her findings , says a @entity7 scientist			1
dr. @entity8 wants credit where credit 's due -- to him , after he says sixth - grader @entity11 pinched his findings about the habitat of invasive lionfish			1
meanwhile , @entity11 's father -- who happens to be best friends with @entity18 's former supervisor -- says his daughter 's name is being dragged through the mud by a frustrated academic			1
' this has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my academic career ' : dr. @entity8 says he 's had enough of seeing media report after media report about the ' breakthrough ' findings about lionfish made by a sixth grade girl fir her science fair project lauded : @entity11 , whose father is good friends with @entity8 's former boss , became a media darling after she made what ecologists saw as breakthrough research about the venomous and invasive lionfish as part of her sixth grade science fair project that frustration may come from the fact that @entity8 , who 's recently graduated with his ph.d. from @entity47 , has indeed dedicated a great deal of his career to researching the lionfish			1
however , it 's @entity11 who 's showing up on television and across the internet after her work was cited in a scientific journal			2
@entity11 's story has appeared on @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 among others			2
' my name has been intentionally left out of the stories , replaced by the name of the 12 - year - old daughter of my former supervisor ’s best friend , ' @entity8 wrote on @entity69			2
' the little girl did a science fair project based on my previously published discovery of lionfish living in low - salinity estuarine habitats			2
' to @entity8 's credit , @entity11 attended his lectures on lionfish as she was doing her own research two years ago for her sixth grade science project			1
she also cited @entity8 's work in her report , notes the @entity82			0
@entity11 's claim is not to have discovered lionfish can live in less saline environments , says her father , but it 's that she took @entity8 's work to the next step by determining just how fresh water can be before the fish will die			1
i thought we were friends : @entity11 's dad says his daughter 's feelings are hurt by @entity8 's accusations and says the little girl merely took @entity8 's findings a step further ' clearly she did not discover lionfish were in the estuary , ' @entity11 's father @entity99 told the @entity82			1
' @entity11 predicted experimentally how far up the estuary they could invade			0
' @entity11 says he even has proof that @entity8 was himself shocked by @entity11 's findings , which she made by changing the salinity inside tanks holding the venomous fish , in the form of emails			1
' @entity113 ( @entity112 , @entity8 's former boss and mr. @entity99 's friend ) told me about the 6 ppt feeding , but i did n’t know she ramped them back up to 27 ppt in 2 hours with no ill effects , ' @entity8 wrote in 2012 , according to an e-mail shared with the @entity82			2
' @entity8 explains away this by saying he tends to ' overstate the excitement and importance of kids ’ discoveries ' in order to encourage them			0
at least one outlet that previously publicized @entity11 's accomplishment has since apologized to @entity8 , who nonetheless appears to see the damage as done			1
' this has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my academic career , ' he said			0
neither is 13 - year - old @entity11 unscathed by the acrimony			0
' when i first kind of told my daughter what was happening , ' @entity11 said , ' she looked at me honestly with a confused look and said , " i thought dr. @entity8 and i were friends			2
’ ” lionfish : the venomous , fast - breeding fish is taking over reefs up and don the @entity146			0
research shows it could also be miles up our rivers thanks to a previously unknown ability to survive in nearly fresh water lionfish , a tropical native of the @entity155 and @entity156 oceans likely introduced through the pet trade , have been colonizing swaths of the @entity159 and @entity160 for years - from the @entity161 @entity146 and the hard - hit @entity162 to the @entity163			1
the a striped saltwater species with a flowing mane of venomous spines , damage reefs and devour native fish , and they are eaten only by sharks — or larger lionfish			0
they have been such a worrying problem that divers in the @entity159 and @entity7 are encouraged to capture them whenever they can to protect reefs and native marine life already burdened by pollution , overfishing and the effects of climate change			0
across the region , governments , conservation groups and dive shops have been sponsoring fishing tournaments and other efforts to go after slow - swimming lionfish to try and stave off an already severe crisis			0
the @entity161 @entity189 launched a campaign in 2010 urging the @entity161 public to ' eat sustainable , eat lionfish ! ' but just because shallow waters hugging coastlines have seen declines , the fast - breeding species is hardly on the way out			0
fat , football - sized lionfish are daily caught in fishing pots set in deeper waters that spear fishermen and recreational divers never see .			0

@entity7 teen @entity11 won third place and her 15 minutes of fame with a project about lionfish
@entity11 shocked scientists who say she discovered the invasive species can survive in nearly fresh water
now @entity8 , who once worked for the best friend of @entity11 's father , says his *original* research has been *co-opted*
the *controversy* *revolves* around findings that lionfish , previously *believed* to be *purely* a marine species , can survive in nearly fresh waters
