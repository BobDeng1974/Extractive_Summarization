the decision also follows a warning by the director - general of @entity48 , @entity49 , who said @entity51 were planning ' mass casualty attacks ' against the @entity53			1
the @entity55 terror threat is currently rated as ' severe ' which means the security forces believe an attack is highly likely			2
mr @entity49 said : ‘ although we and our partners try our utmost , we know that we can not hope to stop everything			2
' ' we still face more complex and ambitious plots that follow the now sadly well - established approach of @entity51 and its imitators – attempts to cause large - scale loss of life , often by attacking transport systems or iconic targets			1
it is understood that @entity1 have done a u-turn over plans to lose 25 officers from the force 's firearms unit ( stock picture ) patrols stepped up : armed @entity79 officers stand next to the @entity81 platforms at @entity83 railway station concerns : the mayor of london @entity85 leaves past two armed police officers after visiting the @entity10 embassy in @entity89 yesterday ‘ we know , for example , that a group of core @entity51 terrorists in @entity93 is planning mass casualty attacks against the @entity53			1
’ he added that the number of ' crude ' attacks had gone up and admitted it was ' almost inevitable ' an attack in @entity55 would succeed sooner or later			1

as such , no areas of the organisation have been untouched in terms of considering where to make savings			0

' asked whether he would reconsider cuts to policing budgets in the light of the @entity5 shooting , prime minister @entity174 told the men : ' yes we have had to reduce policing budgets - we 've done that by some 20pc			0

' crucially in @entity105 crime has come down by 20pc over the past four years			0
it 's a good example of where when you 're faced with difficult long term decisions , if you take them in the right way you can produce a better service for less money			0
' it 's very important @entity105 's police force think through the changes they make very carefully			0
we have been putting more money into counter terror policing in recent weeks in response to what happened in @entity205			0
