parents and independent schools should stop being ‘ sniffy ’ about vocational qualifications and assuming university is the automatic route after a-levels , a leading headteacher has said			1
@entity7 , the headmistress of @entity8 , said employers were increasingly demanding skills that were of genuine use in the work place			1
the cost of taking a degree and the introduction of low - cost online higher education courses added to the need to consider ‘ alternative avenues ’			2
the comments will surprise many parents who can spend tens of thousands a year sending their children to private schools in the hope they will go on to win a place at a top university			1
different route : parents and teachers should not assume that university is the best route after a-levels , a leading headteacher has said ( library image ) but mrs @entity35 , the president of the @entity37 ’ @entity38 , told delegates at the organisation ’s annual conference : ‘ i predict that we ’re going to see the focus shift away from university as the automatic first choice next step for those who are in the fortunate position of being able to weigh up the pros and cons of alternative pathways after sixth form and a move instead to employment skills and training while working			1
’ she added : ‘ increasingly , we - teachers , parents and girls - will need to be open - minded about what further and higher education looks like			2
‘ i believe and hope that the link between schools and employers will strengthen over the coming years and that there will be an increasing focus on developing employment skills			0

‘ there is a huge potential in employer training courses and the new types of apprenticeships which are emerging			0
we must not be sniffy about them			0

mrs @entity7 also used her speech in @entity99 yesterday to attack successive governments ’ obsession with curriculum and exam reforms in state schools , saying they were not the way to bring about social change			1
schools were being turned into ‘ exam factories ’ , she warned , leaving children ‘ dehumanised ’			0
‘ soft skills ’ such as resilience , leadership , integrity , compassion and adaptability also needed to be taught , as well as the ability to ‘ filter ideas ’ as children are now ‘ bombarded ’ with so much information and data			0
outspoken : business secretary @entity86 , pictured , criticised the ' qualification inflation ' that meant degrees had become an entry requirement to many jobs in a further attack on the maintained system , she said healthy pursuits such as outdoor play , school allotments and taking part in the @entity133 scheme were seen as ‘ extra-curricular ’ activities that had become ‘ largely the preserve of independent schools ’			1
‘ many students graduate without any integrated sense of the unity of things , ’ mrs @entity7 said			2
