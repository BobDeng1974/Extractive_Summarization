we 've all stood in @entity1 and wondered if the strawberry bubble bath tastes as good as it smells			2
i dare say some of us have given it a whirl ( and swiftly regretted it ... )			2
but now there is a beauty product that really is good enough to eat			0
@entity10 natural skincare brand @entity8 have created a range of lip balms made entirely of ingredients that are chemical - free , completely vegetarian and wholly edible - especially important in lip products where most of the substance does end up eventually being eaten			1
natural skincare brand @entity8 have launched edible lip balms for £ 3.90 @entity8 use red beetroot extract instead of dye from squashed cochineal beetles the range features three lip balms , @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25 , the last of which gets its lasting red hue from red beetroot extract rather than the usual cochineal insect dye			1
a @entity8 spokesperson said : ' when we were looking at how to add a subtle and natural colour to our @entity33 , we found that most other brands used " @entity36 " as their natural red colouring			2
' this can also be called " @entity38 " , " @entity39 " or " @entity40 "			0
this is made by boiling @entity36 insects in water and extracting the red die from the insects as it breaks down			0
' although there is nothing wrong with this ( except if you are a @entity36 beetle ) , it made us feel a bit funny about having bug residue on our lips , and so we looked for something nicer			0
' after searching , @entity54 found that red beetroot extract gave a much more natural looking colour , and was totally bug - free and healthy when ingested			1
and instead of tasting like beetroot , @entity8 use a natural strawberry flavour for the taste			1
the brand 's all - natural balms were formulated after reading the ingredients on a lip balm they were used during a long car trip			1
@entity10 natural skincare brand @entity8 have created a range of lip balms made entirely of ingredients that are chemical - free @entity36 insects are usually used to make red dye used in make up ' the feel of the lip balms we used to use were great			1
the chemicals used were not			0
especially on lips where most of the product is eventually eaten			0
' chemicals can build up in the body over time			0
what for years might be harmless , can all of a sudden cause a reaction			0
' we have made a lip balms that feel similar to our favorite lip balms from before			1
however , because we make it for our own use , the ingredients are all edible			2
