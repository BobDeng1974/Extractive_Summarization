astronomers are counting down the days before a total solar eclipse appears over @entity2			1
but the highly - anticipated show on march 20th can only be witnessed in full by those in northern @entity5 and the @entity6			1
now scientists have come up with a plan for anyone to see a 360 degree view of the eclipse using @entity13 cameras high above @entity2 's stratosphere			0
but now scientists have come up with a plan for anyone to see a 360 degree view of the eclipse using @entity13 cameras high above @entity2 's stratosphere ' eclipses happen quite often			0
but this one ’s different , ' said project coordinater @entity23			0
' the moon ’s shadow will sweep over the @entity27			0
' ms @entity23 explained that seen from the @entity27 , the moon 's diameter will appear larger than the sun itself , blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into night			2
this means that the solar eclipse will take place just as the sun comes into view after six months of polar night			1
her ' zero2infinity ' group recently launched an @entity41 campaign to raise funds for the project			1
their plan is to launch a balloon carrying @entity13 cameras to record a 360 degree video of the eclipse from at least 31 miles ( 50km ) above @entity2			1
the @entity50 group recently launched an @entity41 campaign to raise funds for the project			1
their plan is to launch a balloon carrying @entity13 cameras to record a 360 degree video of the eclipse from at least 31 miles ( 50km ) above @entity2 the path of totality for next month 's eclipse will travel from just beneath the @entity59 peninsula , heading north into the @entity60			2

the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over @entity66 projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away			1
filters : the sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose			0
such filters have a thin layer of aluminum , chromium or silver on the surfaces			0
telescopes with solar filters : there are sun - specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse			2
on a mobile device : if the @entity41 project is successful , you could stream a 360 degree , hd view of the eclipse onto a mobile device			1
on the ground , participants will get a live stream into their tablet or smart phone showing the stunning event			0
so far the @entity107 - based team have raised $ 3,000 dollars towards their goal to raise $ 28,000 with just 26 days left			2
the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in @entity111 - and around 94 per cent in @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
dr @entity115 , head of the @entity116 told @entity117 that @entity118 in the @entity6 will see two minutes and two seconds of totality			2
and the maximum duration of totality will be two minutes 47 seconds at a point 186 miles ( 300km ) to the east of @entity124 in the @entity125			0
in @entity111 , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will start at 8.45am gmt. the maximum eclipse will hit at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end			1
the solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of @entity66 next month			1
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over @entity2 - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over @entity149 ) this animation is designed to appear from the ' point of view ' of the eclipse as it will occur on march 20			1
it shows the shadow being cast over the @entity156 , @entity59 , @entity66 and into @entity157 the path of totality of next month 's eclipse travels from just beneath the @entity59 peninsula , heading north into the @entity60			2
totality is the path the full shadow travels across the surface of the @entity2 , while a partial solar eclipse will be visible over a region thousands of miles wide			1
dr @entity115 added : ' the path of totality lies well to the northwest of the @entity156 making landfall over the @entity6 and @entity173 as totality moves towards the @entity27			2
' the @entity156 will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse			0
the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in @entity111 and around 94 per cent in @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
a partial eclipse will be visible across @entity66 , @entity180 and @entity157 for about 90 minutes			2
@entity5 and the @entity6 will experience a full eclipse for two - and - a - half minutes ' the place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the @entity156 is the west coast of the @entity186 close to @entity187			1
' here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am gmt. ' skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north - western @entity193 , the @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			2
the last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 august 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029			1
an eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun ’s diameter obscured by the moon			2
it is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration , which is a measure of the sun ’s surface area covered by the @entity213			2
the value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at its maximum			0
the path of the moon 's shadow in august 1999 began in the @entity221 before covering the south of the @entity156 , northern @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , southern @entity149 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229			0
it was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in @entity66 since 22 july 1990 , and the first visible in the @entity156 since 29 june 1927			1
the solar eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over @entity111 and around 94 per cent in the main cities in @entity193 ( pictured is a full eclipse over @entity236 in 2012 )			1
@entity5 and the @entity6 will experience a full eclipse for two minutes and nine seconds dr @entity115 continued : ' in a global context , the maximum duration of totality for next month ’s eclipse will exceed the maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse , which occurred close to @entity246 in @entity247			2
' this is still quite a long way short of the theoretical maximum duration of totality which can reach seven minutes 31 seconds			0
' there will not be another total eclipse until 2026			1
@entity253 , astronomer at the @entity254 told @entity117 : ' since the moon is smaller than the @entity2 , and very far away , the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide , and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the @entity221 and @entity259			0
' however , if the weather is clear , observers on @entity173 and the @entity6 should experience almost three minutes of extraordinary day - time darkness			2
' what ’s more , lunar perigee - the time in the @entity213 month when the @entity2 and @entity213 are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse			2
this makes our 2015 @entity267 eclipse a ‘ supermoon ’ eclipse - perhaps we should call that a supereclipse			0
' since the shadow of the moon will be ever so slightly larger in this scenario , it might appear slightly darker during totality , but in practise i think this would be difficult to detect , even by an experienced eclipse chaser			0
' nevertheless , it ’s nice to have a supermoon , equinox and eclipse all falling on the same day			0
' a total solar eclipse is only visible from a certain region on @entity2 and those who can see it are in the centre of the moon 's shadow when it hits @entity2			1
for a total eclipse to take place , the sun , moon and @entity2 must be in a direct line			1
the totality of the 11 august 1999 eclipse is shown an eclipse occurs when one heavenly body , such as a moon or planet , moves into the shadow of another			0
on @entity2 there are two types - lunar eclipses and solar eclipses			0
lunar eclipse : for a lunar eclipse , the @entity2 moves between the sun and the moon and blocks sunlight normally reflected by the moon			0
instead of light hitting the moon ’s surface , @entity2 's shadow falls on it and a lunar eclipse can only happen when the moon is full			0
solar eclipse : by comparison , a solar eclipse occurs when the orbit of the moon moves it between the sun and @entity2			1
a solar eclipse occurs when the orbit of the moon moves it between the sun and @entity2			1
when this happens , the moon blocks the light of the sun when this happens , the moon blocks the light of the sun reaching @entity2 and the moon casts a shadow on @entity2			0
types of shadow : during a solar eclipse , the moon casts two shadows on @entity2			1
the first shadow is called the umbra , and this gets smaller as it reaches @entity2			0
the second shadow is known as the penumbra , and this gets larger as it reaches @entity2			0
there are additionally three types of solar eclipses : total : a total solar eclipse is only visible from a certain region on @entity2 and those who can see it are in the centre of the moon 's shadow when it hits @entity2			1
for a total eclipse to take place , the sun , moon and @entity2 must be in a direct line			1
people standing in the umbra will see a total eclipse and this will occur over the @entity6 on 20 march			1
partial solar eclipse : this occurs when the sun , moon and @entity2 do n't line up exactly			1
people standing in the penumbra will see a partial eclipse			0
annular : an annular eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from @entity2			0
because the moon is further from @entity2 , it appears smaller			0
as a result , it does n't block the entire view of the sun. the moon in front of the sun resembles a dark disk on top of a larger sun - colored disk and creates what looks like a ring around the moon			0

total solar eclipse set to take place over @entity66 on march 20
@entity398 plans to launch a balloon from @entity107 on the day
it will have @entity402 attached that will stream *footage* to mobile devices
it has launched an @entity41 campaign to raise funds for the project
@entity111 can expect 84 **%** coverage with parts of @entity193 reaching 94 **%**
total eclipse of the sun will occur in @entity417 and @entity6
astronomers said there will not be another total eclipse until 2026
