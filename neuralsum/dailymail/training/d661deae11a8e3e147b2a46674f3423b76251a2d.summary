by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 published : 18:20 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 07:10 est , 27 september 2012 @entity5 officials last night confirmed they are not even searching for missing schoolgirl @entity6 – because her maths teacher @entity7 is not considered a ‘ criminal suspect ’			1
the authorities in @entity5 also said they will make no attempt to arrest the 30 - year - old , even if he is found , because he has not broken any of the country ’s laws , despite eloping with his 15 - year - old pupil without her parents ’ permission			1
the revelation will fuel fears too little is being done to find the pair – who left @entity22 last thursday night after @entity23 began investigating their relationship			0
@entity25 : teacher @entity7 and @entity6 were last seen on @entity26 getting on a ferry to @entity5 almost six days ago and have vanished without a trace even the suggestion that @entity5 police have been waiting for @entity7 to use his bank or credit cards in order to track his movements was rubbished			1
the lack of interest in @entity5 in the runaway pair emerged as police in @entity22 faced searching questions about their own response to reports of what would have been a potentially criminal relationship			2
as @entity6 ’s parents waited for information it emerged : while the schoolgirl ’s disappearance has been making headlines across @entity22 , the coverage on the @entity48 has been much more muted , hindering efforts to track the pair			0
new pictures : these images , released today , show how @entity6 is a fun - loving teenager , but she has also started an inappropriate relationship with her teacher - a man twice her age first pictures : these stills taken from @entity26 camera footage filmed aboard a @entity62 to @entity3 ferry last thursday show 30 - year - old teacher @entity7 with his arm round runaway schoolgirl @entity6 in one picture and walking hand in hand with her in the other distinctive : @entity7 had this image of a young girl wearing a hat and walking a dog ( left ) tattooed on his arm earlier this year			1

' i knew @entity7 as a colleague			0
he worked at a twin school			0
' he did some work for us about two years ago			0
he seemed a nice enough fellow - there was nothing out of the ordinary about him			0
' but this is all about @entity6 and getting her back - then the police can deal with him			0
' the age of consent in @entity5 is 15 , meaning any intimate relationship between them would not be deemed illegal			1
@entity5 prosecutor @entity107 said @entity6 was old enough to travel with @entity7 voluntarily , and unless the authorities received a criminal complaint from their @entity22 counterparts , she would simply be treated as a ‘ missing person ’			1
mr @entity107 , the prosecutor of @entity113 and one of the most senior judicial figures in northern @entity5 , said @entity7 is not a criminal suspect so it would effectively be illegal for police to arrest him			1
‘ the couple will only be stopped if they are spotted during an identity check on the road , or if someone recognises them from photos , ’ he said			0
the use of @entity26 footage is much less common in @entity5			0
officials at @entity129 only began reviewing images yesterday , almost a week after the pair entered the country			0
while some @entity5 media have shown a picture of @entity6 , many refuse to do so because of a fear of falling foul of privacy legislation , while others have had no hesitation in describing the couple as ‘ lovers ’			1
denial : the @entity145 school in @entity91 claim they have robust procedures in place to protect their pupils missing since thursday : schoolgirl @entity6 , 15 , fled to @entity5 with her 30 - year - old maths teacher police in @entity22 are believed to have been in possession of @entity6 ’s mobile phone before she ran away			1
the teenager ’s friends also claimed that her mother had confiscated the phone in the days before she vanished			0
the revelations will fuel questions about how much was known about the girl ’s relationship with @entity7			2

and @entity7 was due to be suspended from school last friday , the day the alarm was raised over their disappearance			2

’ married : @entity202 teacher @entity7 , 30 , pictured with his wife @entity203 on their wedding day in @entity206 the revelations follow confusion surrounding @entity23 ’s response			2
in @entity22 , police have said that they were only told about @entity6 ’s relationship with @entity7 last week , but have declined to specify which day			1
they also first said that the pair left @entity22 in a @entity214 , but subsequently corrected this to say they were in a black @entity176			0
it was also unclear if officers initially realised that the couple had booked return ferry tickets from @entity5 to come back on sunday night			1
a spokesman for @entity23 police declined to comment on a report that officers had confiscated the phones of both @entity6 and @entity7 before they left , although a source said the report contained ‘ inaccuracies ’			1
