president @entity8 's government and the rebels trying to overthrow him accused each other of being to blame for the destruction to the @entity12 , a @entity14 world heritage site and centerpiece of @entity3 's walled @entity16			1
' this is like blowing up the @entity18 or destroying the @entity19 in @entity20			0
this mosque is a living sanctuary , ' said @entity23 , a professor of archaeology at the @entity25			1
' this is a disaster			1
in terms of heritage , this is the worst i 've seen in @entity6			0
' wrecked : the rubble - strewn remains of the 12th century @entity12 in @entity3 which has been devastated by heavy shelling jewel : the complex pictured in 2009 before @entity6 's cataclysmic war turned it into a denuded shell @entity3 , @entity6 's largest city and a commercial hub , emerged as a key battleground in the nation 's civil war after rebels launched an offensive there last summer			1
since then , the fighting has carved the city into rebel - and regime - held zones , killed thousands of people , forced thousands more to flee their homes and laid waste to entire neighborhoods			0
the @entity12 complex , which dates mostly from the 12th century , suffered extensive damage in october as both sides fought to control the walled compound in the heart of the old city			0
the fighting left the mosque burned , scarred by bullets and trashed			1
two weeks earlier , the nearby medieval covered market , or souk , was gutted by a fire sparked by fighting			0
with thousands of years of written history , @entity6 is home to archaeological treasures that date back to biblical times , including the desert oasis of @entity70 , a cultural center of the ancient world			0
the nation 's capital , @entity75 , is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world			1
at least five of @entity6 's six world heritage sites have been damaged in the fighting , according to @entity14 , the @entity82 's cultural agency			1
looters have broken into one of the world 's best - preserved crusader castles , @entity87 , and ruins in the ancient city of @entity70 were damaged			1
both rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of @entity6 's significant historic sites , including citadels and @entity97 bath houses , while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums			1
the destruction of the minaret - which dated to 1090 and was the oldest surviving part of the @entity12 - brought outrage and grief			2
' what is happening is a big shame , ' said @entity108 , a 59 - year - old @entity109 businessman in @entity3			1
' thousands of tourists used to visit this site			0
every day is a black day for @entity6			0
' both rebel and regime forces have set up bases in some of @entity6 's significant historic sites , including citadels and @entity97 bath houses , while thieves have stolen artifacts from museums after : image taken from a video show how the precincts of the mosque have been subjected to a barrage of artillery			1
though many of the original features remain , they have been badly damaged ruined : @entity6 rebel fighters stand in a damaged section of the @entity12 complex the main @entity132 - backed opposition group , the @entity131 , accused the government of intentionally committing ' a crime against civilisation and humanity ' by destroying the minaret			1
' the regime has done all it can to tear apart the @entity6 social fabric , ' the @entity131 said in a statement			0
' by its killings and destruction of heritage , it is planting bitterness in the hearts of the people that will be difficult to erase for a long time to come			0
there were conflicting accounts about what leveled the minaret , leaving the once - soaring stone tower a pile of rubble and twisted metal scattered in the mosque 's tiled courtyard			1
@entity6 's state news agency said rebels from the @entity162 - linked @entity161 group blew it up , while @entity3 - based activist @entity163 said a @entity6 army tank fired a shell that ' totally destroyed ' the minaret			1
the mosque fell into rebel hands earlier this year after heavy fighting but the area around the compound remains contested , with @entity6 troops just some 200 yards away			2
an amateur video posted online by the anti-government @entity174 showed the mosque 's vaulted archways charred from earlier fighting and a pile of rubble where the minaret used to be			1
standing inside the mosque courtyard , a man who appeared to be a rebel fighter , said regime forces recently fired seven shells at the minaret but failed to knock it down			1
on wednesday , the tank rounds struck their target , he said			0
' we were standing here today and suddenly shells started hitting the minaret , ' the man said			2
the army ' then tried to storm the mosque but we pushed them back			2
the video appeared genuine and corresponded to other reporting			0
a picture from last week shows @entity6 rebel fighters walking in the @entity12 complex the destruction in @entity3 follows the collapse a week earlier of the minaret of the historic @entity204 in the southern city of @entity206			1
the @entity206 mosque was built during the @entity209 conquest of @entity6 in the days of @entity210 in the seventh century			2
in that instance as well , the opposition and regime blamed each other			0
the state news agency accused @entity161 of positioning cameras around the area to record the event			2
whether the destruction is targeted or not , the damage highlights the difficulties of protecting a nation 's cultural heritage in wartime			2
' @entity225 can only really be protected in peace time			0
when you have open warfare , it is impossible , ' said @entity23 , the archaeology professor in @entity230			1
' when buildings are under fire , you can not protect the buildings			0
you ca n't protect what 's in it , if they are mosaics , wall paintings , architectural details that are part of the building - there 's no way you can protect them			2
' after the @entity12 was first damaged last year , @entity8 issued a presidential decree to form a committee to repair it by the end of 2013 , although it 's not clear what such a body could do amid a raging civil war			2
the mosque 's last renovations began about 20 years ago and were completed in 2006			1
the damage in @entity3 is just part of the wider devastation caused by the country 's conflict , which began more than two years ago with largely peaceful protests but morphed into a civil war as the opposition took up arms in the face of a withering government crackdown			1
the fighting has exacted a huge toll , killing more than 70,000 people , leaving cities , towns and villages in ruins and forcing more than a million people to flee their homes and seek refuge abroad			0
also yesterday , @entity6 church officials said the whereabouts of two bishops kidnapped in northern @entity6 remain unknown , a day after telling reporters the priests had been released			0
gunmen pulled bishop @entity280 of the @entity281 and bishop @entity282 of the @entity283 from their car and killed their driver on monday while they were traveling outside @entity3			1
it was not clear who abducted the priests			0
but bishop @entity289 of the @entity75 - based @entity281 said the gunmen are believed to be @entity292 fighters from @entity161			0
@entity280 declined to say what made it appear that the @entity161 was involved			0
that account corresponded with one provided by the @entity297 - based @entity296 , which said foreign fighters had abducted the bishops near a checkpoint outside @entity3			1
director @entity301 said activists in the area said the gunmen were foreign fighters from the @entity305			0
however , the main opposition group , the @entity131 , condemned the kidnapping and blamed @entity8 's regime			2
in @entity310 , @entity309 called for the rapid release of the two bishops			0
in his appeal tuesday , the pontiff called the abduction ' a dramatic confirmation of the tragic situation in which the @entity6 population and its @entity109 community are living			0
' there has been a spike in kidnappings in northern @entity6 , much of which is controlled by the rebels , and around @entity75 in recent months			2
residents blame criminal groups that have ties to both the regime and the rebels for the abductions of wealthy residents traveling to @entity6 from neighboring @entity97 and @entity331 .			0
