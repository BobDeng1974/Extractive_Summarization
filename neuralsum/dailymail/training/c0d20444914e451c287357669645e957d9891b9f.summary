a dog who was born with differently coloured eyes is having trouble leaving a rehoming shelter because potential owners ca n't see past her condition			0
@entity9 the collie arrived at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , with her near identical sister @entity13 a month ago			1
but while @entity13 quickly found a new home , @entity9 has struggled and staff believe it is because she has one blue and one brown eye			1
actor @entity30 and actresses @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34 are all affected by the condition , though the differences between their eyes are not as pronounced as with @entity9			0
@entity33 has heterochromia , with one brown and one green eye native @entity42 myth is thought to hold that dogs with two eye colours can see both heaven and earth			0
the lack of pigment does not affect @entity9 's sight			1
staff at @entity10 are appealing for someone to come forward and stop the friendly pet and her pale blue eye from lingering around too much longer			1
@entity54 , from the centre , said : ' @entity9 and @entity13 arrived at the same time , they are both sweet , playful girls of the exact same age			2
' they were both looking for similar homes so there is no reason that @entity9 would be left behind , other than her unusual eye colour			2
' it ’s baffling as she is a fantastic dog and we think her blue eye makes her look really striking			0
' @entity9 is described as an ' affectionate girl ' who loves nothing more than playing			0
@entity10 says she is best suited to an adult - only home with a secure garden , ideally in a rural location so she can enjoy plenty of exercise			2
@entity54 added : ' @entity9 loves company so she would like to find a home with another dog who can act as her doggy guide and help her settle in quickly			0
' we really hope a new owner can see behind @entity9 ’s blue eye and offer her a happy home , just like her sister @entity13			1
' we think @entity9 is a dog in a million and we really hope she catches the eye of a loving new owner soon			0
' @entity10 says @entity9 ( right ) is best suited to an adult - only home with a secure garden , ideally in a rural location so she can enjoy plenty of exercise @entity9 arrived with sister @entity13 ( pictured ) and the shelter said that @entity9 would like to find a home with another dog who can act as her doggy guide			1

@entity9 's right eye is blue ; her left one , brown - a condition caused by heterochromia
her brown - eyed sister , @entity13 , has already found a home
