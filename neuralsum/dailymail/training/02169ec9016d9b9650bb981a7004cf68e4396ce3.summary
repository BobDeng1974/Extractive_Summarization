security experts @entity6 released their annual report on the state of malicious software , and pornographic sites now rank 10th as the riskiest to visit blogs / web communications hosting / personal sites business / economy education / reference technology entertainment / music automotive health / medicine pornography a mere 2 % of pornographic sites are infected - a major turnaround for the internet , where the ' grey ' world of porn used to be synonymous with virus infection			1
but with malicious software increasingly delivered via infected code injected into ' innocent ' websites via adverts or other means , it seems cyber-crooks have deserted pornographic sites			2
15 % of web hosting sites are infected , and 10 % of general business sites			0
spam emails have also dropped down the list as a means of delivery , with 13 % fewer than 2010 - and most using links to infected websites , rather than files within an email			2
the rate of malicious software infection is increasing - especially on mobile			0
' @entity6 blocked a total of over 5.5 billion malware attacks in 2011 , an 81 % increase over 2010			1
web based attacks increased by 36 % with over 4,500 new attacks each day , ' said the company			0
the number of new viruses , worms and trojans also increased , with 403 million new variants of malware were created in 2011 , a 41 % increase of 2010			0

mobile phone users were also increasingly the targets of virus attacks - mobile vulnerabilities continued to rise , with 315 discovered in 2011 .			1

just 2 % of porn sites are infected vs 20 % of blogs
increased use of ' drive - by *downloads* ' means more infections come from ' innocent ' sites
5.5 billion malware attacks in 2011
