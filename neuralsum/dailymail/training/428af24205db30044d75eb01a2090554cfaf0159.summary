@entity2 star @entity1 's move to @entity4 club @entity3 will be confirmed on tuesday			1
@entity3 have called a late - afternoon press conference at @entity2 ' training base - where he is currently preparing with the national squad for a two - @entity10 tour			1
@entity2 head to @entity13 territory on thursday , by which time 28 - year - old @entity1 will , it is understood , have become @entity3 's latest big - name recruit for next season , joining fellow new arrivals like his test squad colleague @entity18 , @entity22 international half - back @entity19 and @entity21 prop @entity18			1
statement : @entity1 is @entity3 's latest big - name recruit for next season fly - half @entity1 , who has won 75 caps , signed a new long - term deal with @entity29 club @entity27 last september , but their subsequent relegation from the @entity31 activated a release clause in his contract			1
@entity1 can expect to fill the number 10 shirt at @entity35 , replacing @entity38 - bound @entity37 international @entity36			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , have delivered a positive fitness bulletin on three players - prop @entity40 , hooker @entity42 and centre @entity43 - after they went off injured during last friday 's senior trial match in @entity47			1
' we think they will all be training later on in the week , even @entity40 , ' @entity2 assistant coach and defence specialist @entity48 said on monday			1
' he had a positive scan , and we will re-assess him later in the week			2
i 've spoken to him , and he seems pretty positive in himself			2
influence : hook can expect to fill the number 10 shirt at @entity35 next season ' at first , we feared the worst with @entity40			1
we thought he had possibly broken his arm			0
' if somebody as tough as @entity40 comes off with his arm wrapped up like it was , i feared the worst , but it is positive news			0
he has not broken his arm or his wrist			0
' @entity42 had quite a nasty bang on his knee			0
we feel he will be training later in the week , and he will be doing more physio			2
@entity43 was precautionary , really , with his shoulder			0
' @entity2 ' opening test against @entity10 in @entity72 on june 14 launches a demanding run of games			1
they meet the @entity13 again in @entity76 seven days later , before @entity10 arrive at the @entity77 in november , along with world champions @entity21 and @entity79 , and then @entity2 kick off their 2015 @entity81 campaign at home to @entity37 next february			1
' we 've had a game ( trial match ) , and the boys will feel more confident going into the first test , ' @entity48 added			0
' it 's a mammoth task , probably the toughest place to play rugby in the world , physically			2
we remember the @entity91 there , and also the first test in 2008 , when we ( @entity2 ) went over			1
' they certainly caught us with their physicality in that first test			0
but in the second test , i thought we did exceptionally well and pushed the @entity13 very , very close			0
we ca n't be caught on the hop , and that 's the reason we had that game ( trial match )			2
on the move : hook is expected to replace @entity38 - bound @entity36 ' it is an outstanding @entity10 squad , as usual			1
personally , i think it is the best team they 've had since the 2007 @entity107			0
' a potential problem area for @entity2 head coach @entity109 on the tour could be openside flanker , with specialist sevens @entity113 and @entity114 both absent through injuries			1
regular test blindside @entity116 is one option , although he has had little game - time in recent weeks with his club @entity120 , while @entity122 forward @entity121 did the job impressively when he lined up for the @entity124 in last week 's trial			1
' he ( @entity116 ) probably needs a bit of a run - out before then ( first test ) , ' @entity48 said			2
' whether he is involved in the first game ( @entity130 on june 10 ) , i am not sure			0
we will decide that later			0
' but to give him confidence , i think it would help him to have a little bit of game - time			2
@entity116 is an integral part of our team			0
maybe we would even take a chance with him without playing in that game			0
' we have incurred serious injuries in two top - class performers on the flanks , who obviously ca n't come on tour			2
' normally , we are very blessed in that area with two outstanding sevens			0
it is a concern , of course it is , but i thought @entity121 played particularly well on friday , and there are other people putting their hands up			0
