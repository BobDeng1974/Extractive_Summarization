by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:59 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 16:59 est , 19 april 2013 communities secretary @entity2 hoped the offer of a ' compromise ' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among @entity7 and @entity8 mps homeowners will keep the right to complain about neighbours ’ plans for large extensions , the government signalled yesterday			1
the move is a major climbdown after @entity17 last year promised ‘ fast - track ’ applications to kick - start the economy through building			1
property - owners were to be given the right to extend as far as 26ft without planning permission or opposition from adjacent families , but conservative and @entity8 backbenchers warned it would pit ‘ neighbour against neighbour ’			1
a revised scheme means homeowners will still have to notify their local council , communities secretary @entity2 said last night			1
he promised to tackle the issue ‘ head - on ’ in a letter to all @entity7 and @entity8 mps last night			1
‘ we are seeking to deliver practical reforms to the planning system to help families improve their home , and to remove excessive red tape on uncontentious , small - scale extensions , ’ he added			1
‘ we will seek to move ahead with these new permitted householder development rights , but introduce a new light - touch neighbours ’ consultation scheme			2
‘ i hope this shows that we have listened constructively and made a targeted and common sense improvement			0
’ under the revised scheme , local authorities will notify neighbours of any applications and approve them if there are no objections made within 21 days			2
councils will decide any contested cases , with the most difficult developments being decided at a full council planning committee			2
mr @entity2 said the new system would mean ‘ uncontroversial improvements are fast - tracked ’ but it also ‘ builds consensus ’ by encouraging homeowners to talk informally to their neighbours in advance			1
‘ @entity68 ’ amenity is protected , with the council and councillors acting as independent arbiters , ’ he added			2
the move also makes it cheaper and easier to extend by removing the need to buy planning documents and shifts power from the state to taxpayers , said mr @entity2			1
‘ we now have a set of reforms that will both help local traders and the wider economy			0
we are backing families who work hard , want to get on and improve their homes , ’ he said			0
‘ we are strengthening individuals ’ property rights and supporting aspiration and home ownership			0
’ under the government 's reforms , the size of single - storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres @entity7 mp @entity95 , who opposed the original plans , said : ‘ i think essentially the government has moved quite a distance to address the specific concerns some of us had			2
' for us a red line was that the neighbour ’s right to object should be kept in place			2
i think people understand that the unfettered free - for - all that was originally proposed is not acceptable			1
‘ the government ’s proposals are not perfect but they have shown that they have listened and taken on board our legitimate concerns			0
most mps will be able to back these new proposals			0
’ councillor @entity115 , chairman of the @entity117 ’s environment and housing board , said : ‘ councils have been calling for the right of neighbours to have a say to be protected , and we are pleased that government is listening			0
‘ however , there are serious questions to be answered as to how this new separate scheme will work in practice			0
unplanned blight : the critics of the ' planning free - for - all ' say it could turn neighbour against neighbour and cause rift in communities ( file photo ) ' the government needs to clarify how this new scheme , which will require a planning department to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources , will be paid for at a time when local authorities are already facing significant cuts to their budgets			1
’ a government source said it had been ludicrous to suggest that mr @entity2 ’ original ideas would have contributed to growth			1
‘ they overstated the problem in terms of the way the planning system normally works			0
ninety per cent of applications are approved			0
’ at the moment , homeowners can avoid seeking planning permission for a single - storey addition of no more than 10ft at a terraced property , or one of 13ft at a detached house			1
the government wanted to double those figures for a three - year period , as long as the extensions did not take up more than half of a garden			0
now , however , only uncontested applications will be allowed to proceed without permission			0
the government says it still expects 40,000 extensions a year to be built under the new fast - track system .			0

revised *law* means that homeowners still have to tell council when extending
communities secretary @entity2 *pledges* to tackle issue ' head on '
mps had warned a free - for - all would pit neighbour against neighbour
