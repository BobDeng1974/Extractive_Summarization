by @entity0 she married the grandson of the man behind apartheid before scandalising the @entity5 community when she became a member of the @entity7			1
now @entity8 , who went on to become an @entity7 mp and ambassador to @entity11 , has penned a memoir of her time with @entity13 - the man she credits with her political transformation			1
' i was very worried about meeting him for the first time , ' she admits			1
' on the night my [ now former ] husband wanted to apologise to @entity13 for his family ’s contribution to @entity21			1
changing times : @entity8 was born into an @entity5 family during @entity21 but went on to become an @entity7 mp architect : @entity25 was prime minister of @entity26 between 1958 and 1966 ' but he would n't hear of it			1
he said that the @entity25 surname could either be a hindrance or a blessing in the new @entity26 and that we had to think carefully about what we wanted to do with that power			1
' that changed my life			2
after a lot of thinking , i joined the @entity7 , became an mp and was later appointed the @entity26 ambassador to @entity11			1
' it was the latest stop in a life that could already be described as extraordinary			2
born @entity44 in 1967 into a well - heeled @entity5 family in @entity46 , her childhood was comfortable and happy			2
' i grew up like any other white @entity5 girl , ' she remembers			2
' i only met @entity26 people when the worked in our garden or house			1
' i went to an all - white school , lived in a white neighbourhood and only had white friends			0
although we were middle - class , it was a very privileged existence in comparison to the majority			0
' later , she went on to study at the prestigious @entity61 , where she met her husband @entity63 , the grandson of @entity25 - the man widely credited with the invention of @entity21			1
but it would prove to be the last conventional turn her life ever took			0
in 1985 , she and her husband moved to @entity71 and there , finally mixing with @entity26 from all races , @entity8 's political world was turned upside down			1
divisive : @entity8 was seen as controversial in the @entity74 , attracting protests both for and against his plans new direction : @entity8 and her husband joined the @entity7 in 1989 after meeting exiles in @entity71 in the late 80s ' i first met young @entity26 exiles while travelling in @entity71 and @entity83 at the end of 1985 , ' she remembers			1
' they told me about what was happening to them - something i did n't really know about before			0
i was a changed person when i returned to @entity26			1
i started reading and questioning everything			0
' but when she aired her changing views to her family and friends , their furious reaction and , eventually , complete ostracism , left her saddened			0
' the hardest part of it all was the break with the @entity8 family , ' she says			1
' @entity63 ’s father would n't speak to us for more than 10 years			1
' it was hard because we had small children and wanted them to see their grandparents			0
so i would pass them to my mother - in - law over the fence and wait in the car or a coffee shop until one needed to be breastfed and then i would return and she would hand them back			2
' but worse was to come			0
after @entity63 's father publicly denounced his son and daughter - in - law , death threats began to pour in			1
much missed : @entity8 says she was devastated when @entity13 died but says he is still her moral compass work : @entity8 also did a stint at @entity116 and is seen here with a @entity119 boy named @entity120 ' we were put on a hit list and it was very uncomfortable for a while , ' says @entity8 , almost laconically			1
' it was so much less than what others endured			0
' also , i never give in to bullies and threats			0
once you do that you will never be able to stand up for anything			0
so it was all worth it because what we did was morally the right thing to do			0
' happily for @entity8 , times were changing in @entity26 and in 1990 , the @entity7 was taken off the banned list			1
four years later , @entity13 and the @entity7 swept to power - and @entity8 , then just 27 years old , with them			1
' i was the youngest woman ever to be elected , ' she beams , ' and it was the most extraordinary time			2
' to be able to be there when @entity13 addressed parliament , to be able to accompany him to official engagements ... just to be in his presence was simply astonishing			2
' it was also a real privilege to play a part in making history , such as when we wrote the final constitution			0
not many people get to do that			0
' and more success was to come even if , sadly , it was at the expense of her marriage which was by now floundering under the strain			0
in 2001 , she was appointed @entity26 's ambassador to the @entity11 , a post which she used to highlight the issue of @entity164 and @entity165 , before stepping down in 2005 as her marriage to @entity63 finally collapsed			1
in 2007 , she became executive director of @entity168 and travelled the world promoting the charity before her employment came to an abrupt end following the death of her partner , the @entity11 radio dj @entity175			2
moving on : @entity8 is back in @entity26 but continues to campaign on women and children 's rights now back in @entity26 , she says the world still needs to do more to solve issues like violence against women and sexual crimes			1
and she is working on a series of personal projects too , among them her new book , @entity188 , a collection of touching memories of the iconic @entity26 leader , among them her own			2
' i last saw him a few years ago at a lunch in @entity196 , ' she smiles			0
' he waved at me to come over which i did and he gave me a big hug			0
' he then complained that he was getting old and that the young women did n't fancy him anymore so i said , " i still fancy you @entity13 " ! ' he then looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said , " yes , but you are not so young anymore " and we both burst out laughing			2
he had such a mischievous sense of humour			0
' @entity13 's death last december left her deeply upset but she says @entity26 is a better place because of him			1
' i was extremely sad , ' she says			0
' it felt like i had lost a grandfather			0
we knew that it was coming and did n't want him to suffer but it still felt like an enormous loss when he died			0
' our country was a disaster and no one other than @entity13 and the @entity7 could have taken us through that very difficult transition with such success , ' she continues			1
' i would n't be so pretentious as to think i played any significant role			0
i just did what i could and what come across my road			0
but @entity13 will always be my guiding light and the voice of conscience			2
' @entity8 's book , our @entity13 , £ 11.95			1
is published by @entity232 and is out now			0
