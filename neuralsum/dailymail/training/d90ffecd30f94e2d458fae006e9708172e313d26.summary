by @entity0 for the @entity1 they used to like a statement at @entity4			1
barely a day went by without one			2
former director @entity5 would say something			2
@entity4 would put out an email			1
it peaked one night in april			2
at 10pm , @entity5 put out some words accusing chief executive @entity10 of deceiving shareholders over the club ’s finances at the agm			2
at 11pm , chairman @entity15 responded			0
by midnight , the rest of us were losing the will to live			0
eventually , the lengthy , incessant missives dried up following the arrival of pr consultant @entity21 , the former @entity22 and @entity23 pr communications director			2
responding to every accusation cheapens the argument			0
it saps what ’s left of the club ’s dignity			0
rangers have been granted leave to appeal the decision to freeze £ 620,000 of the club 's assets the elusive @entity35 could be further involved at @entity36 than is widely acknowledged but the problem is this			1
a picture of powerbroker @entity39 leaving a @entity41 restaurant with @entity35 this week was disturbing and worrying			1
it cried out for a bold , unambiguous statement			0
an assurance to supporters that @entity35 had nothing to do with @entity4 and that the club wanted no dealings with a convicted fraudster sought by @entity50			1
what came instead was , frankly , unbelievable			0
the public relations equivalent of the dog ate my homework			0
a @entity57 subject , @entity35 is wanted on charges of money laundering , corruption and fraud against the @entity62			1
sentenced by @entity64 courts in absentia to 15 years in prison , he ducks justice by taking refuge in nations with no extradition treaty with @entity71			1
@entity57 is one of them			0
so it was , then , that he walked , unencumbered , through the streets of @entity41 side by side with @entity77 minutes after a lunch appointment with @entity80 businessmen who may or may not have been here to invest in @entity4			1
this was surprising for a number of reasons			0
in an interview with @entity87 last december , @entity85 bus tycoon @entity39 said on camera he ‘ had not had any dealings ’ with @entity35			1
it may have been true then			0
from early on tuesday , rumours swirled around @entity41 of a fleet of black @entity94 filled with @entity80 businessmen filing into @entity95 followed by suggestions the mysterious , shady figure of @entity35 was in town			1
when @entity100 made a check call , a @entity4 official denied both claims			1
there would be a vague acknowledgement later that night that the @entity80 had been in town on a youth development fact - finding mission			0
it was a non-story , went the party line , nothing to worry about			0
until , that is , the pictures of @entity77 , @entity35 and the @entity80 the next day told a very different , damaging tale			1
‘ mr @entity35 , ’ claimed a @entity4 statement in explanation , ‘ arrived with the @entity80 delegation without our knowledge			1
he is an advisor to mr @entity119			0
’ @entity4 ' boss @entity120 has been with the club through relegations and promotions , since 2011 on the pitch , @entity4 are looking for promotion back to the @entity126 on a number of levels , this was mind - blowing stuff			1
@entity132 claims of a @entity134 tie - up were more credible			0
if a club from the @entity137 was keen to study best practice in the field of youth - development set - up , would they really choose @entity4 as their role models ? a club whose conveyor belt can be summed up by the words @entity146 and @entity147 ? the further notion of @entity35 , a lurking , villainesque figure in this saga , as a youth development middle man is equally improbable			1
@entity35 ’s fortune is estimated at £ 600million			2
it ’s legitimate to ask why a man of that wealth would be a ‘ middle man ’ for anyone			0
the last time @entity35 ’s name came to light was in the court battle between @entity4 liquidators @entity160 and @entity163 ’s lawyers @entity161 earlier this year			1
judge mr @entity164 ruled that furtive tape recordings of former directors @entity167 and @entity168 openly discussing @entity35 ’s role in the club were admissible as evidence			2
@entity119 — the latest opportunist to pocket a wedge of the club ’s cash — is heard telling @entity176 ‘ there ’s no paper trails ’ linking @entity35 to @entity4			1
@entity179 adds : ‘ there ’s no connection			0
’ this week ’s pictures changed all that			0
it was right there , on the front of a national newspaper			0
as subtle and menacing as a cybernat zealot with a broken caps lock key			0
@entity35 is not only connected to @entity4			1
that image created the impression of a man up to his neck in the brown stuff stinking out @entity36			2
is it really a mere coincidence that , two years after his links with @entity132 and @entity119 were revealed , @entity35 is suddenly back on the scene ? could it be that this outlaw of @entity64 justice knows far more about the shady , faceless institutional investors behind the @entity36 scenes than anyone lets on ? or that some of the £ 5.5million @entity132 used to front up the purchase of the club ’s assets in may 2012 , might have had @entity35 ’s grubby fingerprints on the notes all along ? that ’s the clarifying statement people wanted from @entity4 this week			1
the one statement , you suspect , which will never come			0
@entity4 ' @entity216 ( left ) scores the third in his side 's 0 - 4 win at @entity219			2

@entity35 is wanted on charges of money laundering , corruption and fraud
he has been taking refuge in nations with no extradition treaty with @entity71
@entity35 was *spotted* with @entity4 director @entity39 in @entity41
some think @entity35 is more connected at @entity36 than meets the eye
