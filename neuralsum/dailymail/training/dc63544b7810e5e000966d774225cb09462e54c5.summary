high street brands such as @entity1 and @entity2 have seen online sales of women 's jeans to men rise by a third as guys buy ever - skinnier denims			1
while tight jeans have been part of the hipster uniform for a few years , a new sales spike indicates that men feel that the usual men 's skinny cut just is n't tight enough			1
the circulation - constricting legwear - dubbed the @entity17 - has been championed by the likes of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			0
he said : ' high street retailers have seen a significant number of men in the past six months			0
' these are guys who are buying women 's skinny jeans for themselves so that they can have a super-skinny look			1
' admittedly , a lot of them are buying online rather than in - store , clearly to avoid the embarrassment of having to try on the jeans in a womenswear shop			1
' @entity28 added : ' the reason for this pretty unusual move is that many high street menswear shops have failed to keep up with the increasing trend for even tighter jeans			1
@entity59 ( left ) and @entity60 ( right ) both choose women 's jeans because they like the tighter fit that they give increasing numbers of men are snapping up women 's skinny jeans for a snug fit ' last season quite a few hipster jeans brands that we stock brought out super-skinny ' spray on ' jeans and the demand for them was incredible and they sold out in a couple of weeks			1
' the high - street was n't as quick to pick up on this trend â€“ which is much tighter at the ankle , calf and thighs and so a lot of male high - street shoppers are now having to buy the women 's version instead to emulate the super-skinny style			2
' personal trainer @entity87 , 21 from west @entity88 , wears women 's @entity2 skinny regular jeans in a size 29/30			1
meanwhile , @entity92 , 20 , a supermarket supervisor from @entity93 , @entity94 who loves his @entity96 women 's jeans in a waist size 30/30			2
he said : ' the look is slimmer and tighter than the men 's version			2
' they are skin - tight at the ankle , calf and thigh and there 's actually more room at the front that some of the men 's jeans , so they are pretty comfortable			1
' i wear them because i think they look better on than the mens ' styles in the high street			0
' some of the men 's designer jeans brands have the super-skinny look but i ca n't always afford to buy designer ones , and no one can tell the difference anyway			1
' if i had n't told you that these are girls ' jeans you would n't know , it 's not like they 've got pink stitching or flowers on them			2
' the only downside is that they are pretty hard to get on and off			0
' the trend for skinny jeans has been in for some time now , starting around 2001 , but recently styles got significantly tighter			0
it has previously been reported that mr @entity20 likes to wear women 's jeans designed by @entity138 brand @entity26			0
while @entity19 has previously admitted that he also likes ladies legwear as it gives him a snugger fit than men 's			1
@entity21 is known for his love of skinny jeans although he has never revealed if they 're women 's or not @entity19 is a keen proponent of the super-skinny denim trend , wearing jeans that often look like leggings in 2011 @entity147 's launched their own pair of ' ex-girlfriends jeans ' , inspired by the ' boyfriend jean ' , a looser fit for women based around the idea of female denim fans borrowing their other halves ' jeans			2
the company used women 's denim but tailored them to fit a man 's body			0
however , this craze for super-skinny trousers could have some dangerous side effects			0
a survey by incontinence brand @entity168 , found that 10 per cent of @entity171 men said they had experienced unpleasant side effects from wearing tight jeans			0
one quarter of the men experienced a bladder infection , one fifth had a twisted testicle , and low sperm count and fungal infections were also cited .			0
