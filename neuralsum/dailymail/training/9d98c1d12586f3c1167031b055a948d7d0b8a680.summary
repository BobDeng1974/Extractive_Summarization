rapist @entity0 could have to wait 14 months if he continues to try and have his conviction quashed convicted rapist @entity0 could face a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name			1
former @entity7 player @entity0 has been shunned by several football clubs since he left prison after two - and - a - half years following his conviction for the rape of a 19 - year - old woman			1
now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned			2
this could take more than a year to get to the @entity17 and will mean @entity0 will not have played a professional game for four years			1
because he is still on licence @entity0 is also barred from leaving @entity21 for extended periods , which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold , the @entity19 reported			0
@entity0 was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in @entity28 in north wast wales in 2011			1
he has continued to maintain his innocence			0
once he was released from prison @entity0 launched a website funded by the father of his fiancee @entity34 , to clear his name and applied to the @entity36 in a bid to get his case heard by the @entity17			2
after the 26 - year - old was released from prison an opportunity to return to his former club , @entity7 , was withdrawn when several sponsors threatened to pull out of the club			1
patrons including @entity46 also stepped down and @entity48 champion @entity47 said she would request her name be removed from a stand at the @entity52 stadium if @entity0 was re-signed			0
this led to mrs @entity54 being threatened with rape on @entity57			0
the threats came weeks after @entity60 and @entity61 ’s daughter , @entity59 , was threatened with rape over the issue after @entity64 said live on television that @entity0 should be allowed to return to football			2
last week @entity67 also confirmed it would not be offering the player a contract after a board member was told his daughter would be raped if the 26 - year - old was allowed to play for the team			1
@entity75 chief executive @entity74 said he believed it would now be ‘ very difficult ’ for a club to sign the player while his rape conviction stood			2
@entity0 has been supported by his fiancee @entity34 in his bid to overturn his conviction for rape it is expected to take months for the @entity36 to decide whether the @entity0 case should go to the @entity17 , the @entity82 reported			2
on average this takes around 38 weeks , and decisions on whether to quash an appeal can take as long as six months			0
@entity0 previously played for @entity7 but has so far failed to secure a contract at another club the former footballer will also have problems getting signed by a club overseas because he is still on licence after being sentenced for five years in prison for rape			1
this effectively bars him from working abroad and means he is unable to leave the country for extended periods			0
this has led him to put his wedding plans to @entity34 on hold so the pair can go on honeymoon abroad			0
@entity0 has been criticised for his lack of remorse since he left prison and last week issued a carefully crafted statement apologising for the ' effect that night in @entity28 ' had on the woman concerned			1
some have questioned his rape conviction , saying they believe he does have a case for the @entity17			0
these include commentator @entity113 who said there were ' grave doubts ' about his conviction .			0

@entity0 was convicted of raping a drunk woman in @entity28 , @entity119 in 2011
he was released last year after serving half of a five year prison sentence
@entity0 has maintained innocence and applied to have conviction quashed
offers to train with former club @entity7 withdrawn after *reaction*
last week @entity67 also refused to sign him because of the outcry
his best *prospect* of playing football again is to overturn his conviction
could take 14 months and will mean he has been out of game four years
