by @entity0 headteachers should be forced by the government to publish their salaries to prevent a looming ‘ dash for cash ’ , a union said yesterday			2
the @entity7 has attacked the inflation of leadership pay deals , which has seen a record rise in six - figure wages			1
it wants heads to come under the same scrutiny as council chiefs or quango bosses to prevent abuse of taxpayers ’ money			1
a teaching union warns rising headteacher salaries are diverting funds away from the classroom some 900 school leaders are paid at least £ 100,000 including 300 who take home £ 110,000 or more , according to recent @entity27 figures			1
@entity28 , general secretary of the @entity7 , yesterday warned that the government ’s overhaul of leadership pay could lead to further large increases			1
changes giving governors more flexibility over the awarding of heads ’ salaries are being introduced this september			1
this means they will have greater freedom to ‘ rubber stamp ’ requests from school leaders for their performance - related rises , miss @entity39 warned			2
but restricted school budgets could lead to less cash being available for the wages of classroom teachers			0
@entity28 , @entity7 general secretary , is demanding greater scrutiny of headteacher pay miss @entity39 said the union was ‘ very concerned ’ about a possible ‘ dash for cash ’ from head teachers at the beginning of the autumn term			1
she said : ‘ we ’re being extremely vigilant and are preparing ourselves during the summer term for what we think is going to be considerable casework in schools and possibly escalation of ( industrial ) action at school level where we find that schools have depressed teachers ’ salary for arbitrary reasons but headteachers ’ salary is increasing			0
‘ more and more power is being delegated to governing bodies , many of whom , of course , rubber stamp what head teachers say			0
’ she added : ‘ this is public money and our view is there ’s a very quick way to resolve this			0
all the government has to do is stop exempting headteachers from not having to publish their salaries annually			2
‘ every other senior executive in the public sector is required to publish their salary annually , except headteachers			0
public money should not be changing hands behind closed doors			0
’ it emerged earlier this month that one in four secondary school heads now earns at least £ 100,000 , with some receiving almost double that amount			1
an annual census of the school workforce - published by the @entity27 - showed that 600 heads earned between £ 100,000 and £ 109,999 and 300 took home more than £ 110,000			1
prime minister £ 142,500 @entity106 consultant £ 75,249 - £ 101,451 principal @entity108 £ 70,271 - £ 80,747 member of parliament £ 67,060 @entity110 £ 40,600 police sergeant £ 36,519 - £ 41,040 station manager in @entity113 £ 36,365 - £ 40,109 teacher ( outside @entity115 ) £ 34,523 - £ 37,124 @entity106 nurse @entity116 £ 30,764 - £ 40,558 paramedic £ 21,176 - £ 27,625 all were secondary heads - 600 at academies and 300 at council - operated schools			1
two years ago , 700 were on six figures			0
however , the figures may under - estimate the actual number of large pay packets because another 600 leadership salaries were recorded as ‘ misreported ’			1
earlier this year , the @entity131 ’ @entity126 , which makes recommendations to the government on teacher salaries and working conditions , said @entity132 , @entity133 , had sought ‘ maximum discretion ’ for governing bodies in setting head teachers ’ pay			1
outlining its reforms , the @entity138 said it was providing ‘ formal headroom at the top of the pay range to incentivise and reward heads taking on some of the largest and most challenging leadership roles ’			1
it added : ‘ schools are now free to make differentiated , performance - based progression awards to classroom teachers ; and have local discretion to pay a higher salary to the very best teachers			2
we believe similar flexibilities should apply to pay of school leaders			2
’ @entity154 , general secretary of the @entity155 , said yesterday : ‘ i am not in favour of publishing individual heads ’ salaries because they already have some of the most exposed , scrutinised roles in the public sector			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity27 said : ' it ’s essential we have the best people in place to lead our schools if we are to raise standards			0
that ’s why decisions on pay are down to schools so that they can recruit and retain the highest calibre of school leaders			0
we are also giving schools the freedom to reward classroom teachers who get the best out of their pupils			0
' academies already publish the salary bands of all teaching staff earning over £ 50,000			0
we have accepted the recommendations of the @entity184 to provide clear guidelines around how governing bodies should decide on headteachers ' pay			0

the @entity7 wants greater scrutiny of headteacher pay
1 in 4 heads earn at least £ 100,000 a year , some are on nearly double that
@entity196 warns @entity198 reforms could push salaries even higher
