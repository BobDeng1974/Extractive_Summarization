' @entity78 , campaign director of business for @entity2 , said : ' we 've been pouring more and more money into the @entity3 every year , only to see far too much of it squandered			2
' @entity36 threw away much of our rebate in return for empty promises of reform that never materialised			0
it 's about time @entity7 curbed its spending , rather than making extra demands on the @entity2 because our economy is growing			1
' a new poll today showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the @entity94 in the wake of the latest demand for more money			0

mr @entity101 warned @entity126 that , while @entity25 is a winner from the current round of readjustments to national contributions , it could find itself targeted with a massive bill through the ' arbitrary and random ' process in future			2
speaking ahead of the meeting in @entity102 , mr @entity101 said that the @entity2 will ' scrub these figures very , very hard ' - including an analysis of any impact on the @entity2 's £ 3 billion - a - year @entity3 rebate - and pledged : ' we will make sure that it is lower			1
' @entity25 is the biggest gainer from the recalculation of national contributions to @entity3 budgets , and is due to receive one billion euro ( £ 800million ) , while @entity3 partners including the @entity122 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 face surcharges chancellor @entity151 last night insisted he is ' confident ' of securing changes to the figures , which shocked @entity15 when they emerged during a @entity155 summit in @entity7 last week			1

; ' mr @entity101 said the @entity2 needed to ' build alliances ' to challenge the @entity21 demands , adding : ' we are not going to pay this money			2
