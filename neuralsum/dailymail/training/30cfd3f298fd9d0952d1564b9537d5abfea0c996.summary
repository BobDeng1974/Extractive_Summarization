patients with more sympathetic , understanding doctors have better outcomes and fewer complications , new research suggests			0
by measuring a doctor ’s understanding of a patient ’s concerns , pain , suffering and an intention to help , researchers found a link between diabetic patients ’ outcomes and their physicians			1
a large study done by a team from @entity18 along with @entity20 researchers evaluated the relationships among 20,961 diabetic patients and 242 primary care physicians they were enrolled to in @entity25 , @entity26			1
researchers have found that more sympathetic doctors meant their patients had better outcomes and fewer complications @entity30 , @entity31 , research professor of the @entity32 and director of @entity34 in the @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity37 at @entity38 said : ‘ this new , large - scale research study has confirmed that empathic physician - patient relationships is an important factor in positive outcomes			1
‘ it takes our hypothesis one step further			0
' compared to our initial study , it has a much larger number of patients and physicians , a different tangible clinical outcome , hospital admission for acute metabolic complications , and a cross-cultural feature that will allow for generalisation of the findings in different cultures , and different health care systems			2
’ researchers used the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) which measures the level of empathy in the context of patient care			2
researchers used the results of two medical tests , the @entity69 ( blood ) test and cholesterol levels measurements , and found a direct association between a physian ’s @entity61 and a better control of their patient ’s medical results			2
dr @entity30 said : ‘ results of this study confirmed our hypothesis that a validated measure of physician empathy is significantly associated with the incidence of acute metabolic complications in diabetic patients , and provide the much needed , additional empirical support for the beneficial effects of empathy in patient care			1
much needed information : the research supports the beneficial effects of empathy in patient care ‘ these findings also support the recommendations of such professional organisations as the @entity95 and the @entity96 of the importance of assessing and enhancing empathic skills in undergraduate and graduate medical education			1
’ @entity20 patients and doctors were evaluated because there is universal health care coverage in @entity26 and there is no confounding effect of difference in insurance , lack of insurance or financial barriers to access care			1
‘ what 's more , this second study was conducted in a health care system in which all residents enrol with a primary care physician resulting in a better defined relationship between the patients and their primary care physicians than what exists in the @entity126 , ’ said co-author @entity113 , managing director for the @entity35 in @entity36 and @entity37 and research associate professor of family and community medicine at @entity38			2
co-author author @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , associate professor at the @entity132 of @entity133 said : ‘ @entity26 has a lower rate of switching doctors , facilitating long - lasting physician patient relationships			0
’ according to the @entity137 , over 25 million people in @entity126 have been diagnosed with diabetes , with almost 700,000 hospitalisations per year			0
in the @entity141 , 2,9 million people live with diabetes , up from 1.4 million in 1996			0
there are approximately two million new cases per year			0
worldwide , the number of total cases jumps to 180 million .			0
