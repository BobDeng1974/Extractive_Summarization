@entity0 is developing a range of ‘ self - filling ’ cars that would never need to visit a petrol station			1
when the tank is close to empty , the car would send a message via smartphone to a mobile fuel supplier to come and top it up			1
the supplier would have a secure one - off code to open up the fuel cap , freeing the owner to park the vehicle and be elsewhere			1
however , the @entity27 firm ’s head of technology , @entity25 , told the @entity29 : ‘ the widespread use of smartphones is unlocking new potential in what you can do connecting a car with a customer			2

‘ but for long , boring passages you could have automation and sit back , relax , read emails , and regain 30 minutes of your life you could use to spend with your family			0
