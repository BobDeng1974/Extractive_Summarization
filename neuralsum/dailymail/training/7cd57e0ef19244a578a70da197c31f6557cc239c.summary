by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:59 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 10:44 est , 18 december 2013 the mobile communications technology race has taken an interesting turn with the release of plans for a smartphone with a dual display			1
tech giant @entity9 has filed a patent for a phone with two interconnected touchscreens that can display two independent applications , or work together to give the user an enhanced experience in gaming , reading e-books , conference calls , web browsing and multi-tasking			1
pictures of the device have been filed with the @entity23 and show the potential benefits of the technology			1
seeing double : @entity9 has filed a patent for a phone with dual displays @entity9 's filing contained more than a hundred patent figures broken into distinct categories such as calendars , photo cataloging and many more , reports @entity34			1
the dual displays are connected by a hinge , which allows the as - yet - unnamed device to stand freely , similar to the rigid covers used by tablet owners			1
this provides exciting gaming opportunities , as users can sit around a table with one screen visible to them and one on display to their opponents			1
let 's play : the phone offers innovative gaming opportunities as one screen is seen only by the player , while the other is visible to all in terms of photos , the phone can display an image on one screen and photomanipulation tools on the other , allowing easy retouching			1
the two screens could also display images and video across both screens for a more immersive experience			2
the images in the patent filing also show an enhanced conference call function , where the participants ' faces are shown at the top of the screen , while other data , such as a business presentation or scientific data , is displayed along the bottom			2
it also acts as an e-reader , where the user can hold the two screens with text on both displays , a experience more akin to reading an actual book than usually afforded by conventional e-readers last month @entity9 promised to introduce devices with fully folding displays to the general market in 2015			2
front and back touch screen technology earlier this month @entity9 filed a patent for a phone with a transparent screen with touch screen technology on both the front and back have been revealed in what could be the next step forward in smartphone technology			0
the plans for the future transparent display that can be controlled by fingertip from both sides of the phone			0
pictures of the device have been filed with the @entity104 show the potential benefits of the technology , such as the user 's finger not obscuring the screen when tapping on apps or dragging items around the screen			2
curved screen the latest version of @entity9 ’s @entity117 smartphone could have a three - sided display , rumours suggest			0
the new smartphone , which is tipped to launch next year , might sport a wrap - around display so that content on the curved screen can be read from extreme angles			0
the display is likely to feature on @entity9 ’s @entity125 or note luxury handsets , but it could even be the first of a new line of curvier handsets , according to recent rumours			0
the budget option this week @entity9 announced yet another handset in its @entity117 range of smartphones aimed at buyers on a budget			0
the @entity136 is a marginally improved version of the @entity136 , which the @entity139 firm launched in june , and the @entity140 that launched in @entity141 in october			1
it has the same 8gb basic storage as the @entity136 , as well as the same camera , but comes with a slightly larger 4.7 - inch screen			0
it is expected to retail at between £ 150 and £ 170 .			0

the device from @entity139 tech giant will feature dual touchscreens
the two screens will offer enhanced functionality for a range of applications
it has *implications* for *handheld* gaming , e-reading and other features
