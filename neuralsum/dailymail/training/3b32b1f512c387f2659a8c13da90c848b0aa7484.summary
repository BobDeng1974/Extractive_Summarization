post office thief @entity11 ( left ) stole the shop 's takings to sail the world on luxury cruises while her best friend , postmistress @entity22 ( right with husband @entity30 ) fed her family on mouldy bread magistrates found @entity11 guilty of stealing the stock between 2008 and 2012 in december , but sent the case to @entity34 as they did not feel the maximum six month prison sentence they could impose would be sufficient			1
however , she was given a suspended six month sentence when she appeared before @entity38 on friday			1
mrs @entity22 and her husband @entity30 , 45 , had already received a £ 28,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by @entity11 in a civil case prior to her trial			1
the couple had employed @entity11 to work 14 and a half hours a week , and paid her £ 6.10 an hour			1

@entity11 also enjoyed regular beauty treatments and was a @entity58 season ticket holder , travelling all over the country staying in hotels , her victims said			1
mrs @entity22 had refused to believe her best friend was to blame as the post office and village shop teetered on the brink of ruin			1
mr @entity51 became suspicious when ' appalling ' takings at the @entity67 ( pictured ) suddenly flourished after @entity11 booked herself on a three - week voyage to @entity69 but mr @entity51 became suspicious when ' appalling ' takings suddenly flourished after @entity11 went on a three - week voyage to @entity69			1
meanwhile , they collected coupons towards a cheap break at @entity76 ’s @entity75 in @entity77			0
' she was systematically stealing from our business while keeping a smile on her face , ' @entity51 told the judge at @entity83			1
' i totally trusted her			0
i thought she was my best friend in the village			0
little did i realise her hidden agenda			0
' mr @entity51 had told the original trial that he and his wife had ' inherited ' @entity11 when they took over the post office and shop in 2008			1
@entity11 was handed a six month jail sentence , suspended for two years , and ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work she had worked in the shop under the store ’s previous owners - who had also struggled to make ends meet , he added			1
the court heard that @entity11 knew most of the people in the small village and had served them for more than 20 years			2
by 2012 , local businesses - seeing the store was getting run down - clubbed together to pay for a refurbishment , which included @entity104			2
when mr @entity51 checked the footage , he was amazed to see @entity107 wandering around the empty shop slipping all manner of goods in her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later			2
mr @entity51 told the court he believed the true loss was more like £ 50,000 , and he had long suspected his employee had been stealing			2
he added : ' it stuck out a lot more when @entity11 was on holiday			1
we could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday			2
' i suspected after a while there was something wrong			0
but because @entity11 was @entity22 ’s best friend she just would not hear of it			1
' @entity129 , mitigating for @entity107 , of @entity130 , @entity14 , claimed the cruises were funded by her husband @entity132 who worked for @entity133			0
@entity135 @entity134 could have jailed @entity11 for six months but presiding magistrate @entity136 had said : ' the offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you			2
' you were entrusted to run the business while the owners were away			2
we can not see there would be any higher degree of trust			0
' the seniors were stunned when the judge at @entity34 gave @entity11 a six month jail sentence suspended for two years			1
she was also ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work , pay £ 300 court costs and an £ 80 surcharge			0
@entity11 , who has already repaid the @entity147 £ 3,050 for the stock , showed no emotion when sentence was passed			1
the court was told she has a previous criminal record for theft from an employer in 1989			0
after the sentence , @entity51 stormed that it ' made a mockery ' of the magistrates ' decision			2
' i do feel that this was an extremely light sentence bearing in mind it is not the first conviction for theft from an employer , ' she said after the hearing			2
' however , the justice system is the law of the land and we have to abide by this			0
' both the civil case settlement and the guilty verdict can now give us closure on the matter			1
' from the bottom of our hearts , we would also like to thank the local community for their tremendous support			0
' the couple have a disabled daughter , @entity188 , 13 , who suffers from the rare genetic disorder @entity189 , and another daughter @entity190 , 11			0
mrs @entity22 added : ' we were eating mouldy bread and buying second hand @entity49 presents from charity shops			1

she was my best friend , and the best friend of the people who had the shop before us			0
' i just sank and went to bed for four days			0
now i do n’t even want to be in the same room as her			0
' mr @entity51 said : ' i do n’t know why she got such a light sentence			0
we are just glad it ’s over because it ’s been a very stressful time			0
' the business is thriving now and all the problems it had are over			0
the customers are disgusted at what @entity11 did			2
' most are just happy their village post office and shop are still here			1
they nearly went to the wall			0
at least we can move on now			0
' she went on at least ten cruises while we were on the rocks			0
' at one stage we were only a week from going under and i had to take a second job as a chimney sweep to prop the business up			0
' we put £ 43,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world			2
