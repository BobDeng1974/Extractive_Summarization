@entity0 appeared to hit back at those criticising him after @entity3 manager @entity2 revealed the 19 - year - old said he was too tired to start against @entity5			1
the @entity7 winger tweeted a cryptic response shortly after midnight on monday : ' now listening to ... excuse me for being human			1
' the message came after @entity0 retweeted those criticising his decision , including one post that suggested he should ' try getting up at 5am six days a week and putting in a proper shift '			1
@entity0 failed to complete training on saturday night after only playing 45 minutes in thursday 's 5 - 0 win against @entity49 at @entity50 , and @entity41 started in his place on sunday			1
after the 1 - 0 win , @entity2 said : ' people do n't like it when you simplistically tell the truth			1
' we were training at @entity58 doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically			0
' just before we started , @entity0 had done the warm up and he came to me and said , " look i really am feeling a bit tired , i 'm not in my best form at the moment because i am feeling a bit tired "			2
' so i said the best thing is @entity41 starts the game and you rest and i have got you to bring on from the bench , simple as that			0
' as you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he is n't suffering from anything			0
' @entity2 also claimed @entity7 's poor start to the new @entity78 season could be behind @entity0 's decision to pull out of the starting line - up in @entity24			1
the @entity3 substitutes watch on as 19 - year - old @entity0 ( second right ) was rested from the starting line - up @entity17 's @entity7 team - mate @entity41 started in his place after the 19 - year - old complained of tiredness ' there is an awful lot going on in his head , ' the @entity3 manager added			1
' perhaps it 's quite simply the season has n't started quite as well for @entity7 as they wanted			2
' he 's a player who 's always in the focus and spotlight for @entity3 and @entity7 , maybe that 's had some effect			1
but i do n't know , it 's a theory			0
' in mitigation of a young player , when you break into a team like @entity7 and you have a fantastic season , then you go to the @entity102 and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation			0
' then you come back and you 're still only 19 years of age , there are a lot of other things that play a part it people 's make up			2
it is n't quite as simple as the training you 're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs			0
' @entity0 told @entity2 he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on saturday @entity0 came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on @entity121 for his decision 32 - @entity37 , @entity123 29 - @entity124 28 - @entity39 , @entity30 27 - @entity35 26 - @entity41 24 - @entity22 , @entity40 23 - @entity38 22 - @entity33 21 - @entity126 - @entity125 19 - @entity127 , @entity0 @entity2 insists the @entity7 youngster played at his best in the @entity129 , and says bringing @entity0 on in place of @entity22 should be no cause for concern			1
' do n't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against @entity49			0
it was two days after the game , ' @entity2 continued			2
' it was fatigue he had n't managed to shake off after the @entity49 game , it was no more complicated than that			0
is it common ? i do n't really know			0
' at international level , when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt , i do n't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you 're not at your best			0
' we have to take players ' welfare into consideration and there are times when top league teams with @entity160 football when players suffer from a physical and mental fatigue			1
' @entity0 , warming up during the first half , complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the @entity44 qualifier			2
