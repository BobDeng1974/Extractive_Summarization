criticism : sir @entity1 , the most senior family court judge in @entity2 and @entity3 , said the council should not see itself as ' guardians of morality ' social workers were accused by a senior judge of ‘ social engineering ’ after trying to take a child for adoption because his father was involved with the @entity13			1
they decided that the far - right political group was ‘ barbaric ’ and the 25 - year - old man ’s views were ‘ immoral ’			0
he should not be allowed to bring up his child because the boy needed ‘ an environment that supports difference , equality and independence ’ , they said			0
but sir @entity1 , the country ’s most senior family judge , blocked the adoption , ruling that the father ’s failure to be a good role model did not justify taking his child away			1
the toddler was placed in foster care at birth when @entity33 raised concerns over his father 's ties to the @entity13 and a sex caution he received as a teenager			1
social services staff said they found the man to be ' immoral ' and should therefore not be given custody of his child			1
but the judge yesterday criticised the council , saying it should not see itself as ' guardians of morality '			2
in a written ruling , he stated the father could be ' immature ' and ' irresponsible ' but said there was a risk of ' social engineering ' if the toddler was to be permanently removed from his care			1
he said : ' i can accept that the father may not be the best of parents , he may be a less than suitable role model , but that is not enough to justify a care order let alone adoption			2
' we must guard against the risk of social engineering , and that , in my judgment is what , in truth , i would be doing if i was to remove [ the toddler ] permanently from his father 's care			1
' he ruled the council had failed to show the child , now 13 months old , would be at risk of harm in the care of his father and said he should be returned to his care			1
sir @entity1 , president of the @entity79 of the @entity79 , made his complaints after analysing the case at a family court hearing in @entity83			1
he said the approach taken by the council had been almost a textbook example of how not to pursue a care case and was ' very critical ' of its analysis and conduct of the litigation			2
the toddler 's father , who has not been named , had wanted to care for him , said sir @entity1			1
the toddler 's mother had not put herself forward as a carer - and had supported the father 's application			0
but social services staff said the youngster should be adopted and had raised concerns about his father 's morality			1
the charges laid by @entity33 social workers against the father were that he lied about being present at a railway accident as a child , that when he was 17 he had sex with a 13 - year - old and this was immoral , that he drank too much and used cannabis , and that he had briefly been an activist with the @entity13			1
they said he had ‘ numerous ’ criminal convictions when , in fact , he had two police cautions			0
action : the toddler was placed in foster care at birth when @entity33 ( headquarters pictured ) raised concerns over his father 's ties to the @entity13 and a sex caution he received as a teenager the child was born in january last year while his mother was in prison and immediately taken into council care			1
she accepted she could not bring up her boy			0
social workers produced the string of allegations against the father as they prepared an adoption case			2
one social worker recorded : ‘ the distorted thinking of those within the @entity13 is barbaric and their actions inappropriate			2
therefore the mentality of those involved has to be brought into question			0
’ the social worker also pointed out ‘ the immoral nature of the values and beliefs ’ of @entity13 members and the violence of their protests			2
the father had ‘ some involvement ’ with the @entity13 during 2013 , sir @entity1 ’s judgment published yesterday said			1
sir @entity1 said the the council had ' conspicuously ' failed to show that the toddler would be at risk of harm or neglect in the care of his father			1
he said it was ‘ extraordinary ’ that social workers should describe his politics and a teenage encounter with an under - age girl as immoral			2
he added that many 17 - year - olds have had sex with under - age girls , but that does not mean they should lose their children			2
' the city fathers of @entity33 and @entity33 's director of social services are not guardians of morality , ' said sir @entity1			1
' nor is this court			0
' he added : ' the justification for state intervention is harm to children , not parental immorality			0
' sir @entity1 , who did not identify the family involved , made a series of criticisms of the council			1
' i am very critical of the local authority 's analysis , its handling of the case and its conduct of the litigation , ' he said			0
' there are lessons here to be learned , not just by this local authority and its staff but also by practitioners more generally			0
' sir @entity1 said the allocated social worker had been ' plainly both inexperienced and too inexperienced for a case of this complexity '			1
he said her work had been ' seriously flawed '			0
and he said a second social worker seemed neither to have ' explored nor analysed ' in any detail the underlying factual basis of the council 's case			0
' in a significant number of very material respects the local authority has simply failed to prove the factual underpinning of its case , ' said sir @entity1			1
' the local authority was too willing to believe the worst of the father , which led to it being unduly dismissive of what he was saying			0
' sir @entity1 said he had ' quite deliberately ' not identified either of the two social workers or a team manager			1
but he said he had deliberately identified @entity33			0
' it is @entity33 and its senior management that are to blame , not only social workers and a team manager , ' said sir @entity1			1
decision : sir @entity1 made his complaints after analysing the case at a hearing at @entity231 ( pictured )			2
in the written ruling , he said the boy , now 13 months old , should be returned to his father ' it would be unjust to the social workers and the team manager to name and shame them when others are not similarly exposed			2
' sir @entity1 said he had reached conclusions about the toddler 's father after going through the council 's concerns in detail			1
he said : ' the father is immature and can sometimes act irresponsibly			0
in some instances , though not to the extent alleged by the local authority , the father has minimised or played down matters which were properly of concern to the local authority			0
' he has not always been open and honest with professionals			0
' to an extent the father is lacking in insight regarding [ the toddler 's ] needs and minimises some aspects of his character and behaviours which may bear adversely on [ the toddler ]			0
' on occasions the father drinks to excess			0
on occasions he has taken cannabis			0
' there have been episodes of domestic discord between the father , his mother and his step - father , involving the police and , on occasions , actual violence			0
' but the judge said he had found the man to be a ' truthful and , for the most part , reliable '			0
he said this did not establish a real possibility that the toddler will suffer significant harm , or that his welfare requires him to be adopted			0
sir @entity1 suggested that similar concerns might be raised about many men			1
' it is an undoubted fact of life that many youths and young men have sexual intercourse with under - age girls			0
but if such behaviour were to be treated without more as grounds for care proceedings years later , the system would be overwhelmed , ' said sir @entity1			1
his analysis of the concerns about the man 's links with the @entity13 was similar			2
' the mere fact , if fact it be , that the father was a member , probably only for a short time , of the @entity13 is neither here nor there , whatever one may think of its beliefs and policies , ' said sir @entity1			1
' it is concerning to see the local authority again harping on about the allegedly ' immoral ' aspects of the father 's behaviour			0
' he added : ' i can not accept that the father presents the kind of risk to [ the toddler ] which gives rise to a real possibility of [ the toddler ] suffering significant harm , let alone the degree of risk which would have to be demonstrated to justify a plan for adoption			2
' the case follows an incident in 2012 when three children in @entity331 were taken from foster parents after social workers discovered they were @entity334 supporters			0
@entity335 , chief executive of @entity336 controlled @entity33 , said : ‘ we have taken the issues raised by sir @entity1 on board			1

boy was placed in care at birth when council *branded* his father ' immoral '
raised concerns over ties to @entity13 and police caution he received aged 17
but social services failed to show boy would be at risk of harm in his care
sir @entity1 said council should **n't** be seen as ' guardians of morality '
@entity362 father ' may not be best of parents ' but that is **n't** enough to justify care
the top judge added ' we must guard against the risk of social engineering '
