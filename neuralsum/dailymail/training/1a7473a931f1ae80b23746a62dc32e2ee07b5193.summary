the wait is nearly over			0
the much - anticipated fragrance from @entity2 - @entity3 - goes on sale on august 25th at @entity5 and is being described as the biggest ever celebrity perfume launch			1
the store has held off doing any additional promotion as the fragrance is likely to sell out within the first few days of going on sale			0
the celebrity fragrance market grows bigger every year - with last year 's sales worth £ 255 million in the @entity12 - and this year 's figures looking like they will top that			1
we 've come a long way from the first celebrity fragrance - @entity19 - designed for @entity20 by @entity21 in 1957			0
to date , the most successful celebrity fragrance ever is @entity24 's @entity23 , which followed the launch of her first fragrance , @entity27 , in 1989			1
and like @entity2 , they all say they are hands - on with every aspect of the production of their perfumes , from the all - important packaging to the shape of the bottle to what goes into it to produce the actual scent			1
there are only four sample bottles of our moment available in the @entity12 - but i 've managed to get my hands on one , so can tell you precisely what it 's like			1
the pale pink box features black and white pictures of the boys on one side and silvery grey roses - a hint of what 's inside the bottle			1
this is definitely one for the girls - and very girly girls at that			0
hardly surprisingly there is a waiting list for this - but the real surprise is that the ages range from 16 to 68 - so it 's not just for very young fans , the bottle is a bit of a surprise - in that it 's a hexagonal shape with what looks like @entity34 's upside - down tutu topped with a tiara as a stopper			1
to date , the most successful celebrity fragrance ever is @entity24 's @entity23 actually it 's meant to be a pink flower , made of netting , that reflects the blend of jasmine petals and frangipani , which combined with pink grapefruit , wild berries and red currants make up the actual fragrance			2
if that 's not enough - dry woody notes of musk and patchouli add to the overall effect			2
it 's certainly a scent that you wo n't forget in a hurry as it does n't wear off			0
i liked getting perfume when i was a little girl			0
in those days , it came in teddy shaped glass bottles from @entity127 's and was either lavender water or eau de cologne			2
i found our moment very sweet and a tad too heavy for daytime for grown - ups - and even an hour after first spraying this , the smell still lingered over me like a huge cloud of frangipani and candyfloss			0
i have nothing against frangipani , it 's just combined with everything else that the overall effect is a bit cloying			0
now it seems that everyone has their own fragrance ; @entity48 's scent is called ' girlfriend ' ( right ) @entity50 poses naked in the ad campaign for her perfume , @entity152			2
the singer has miniature scantily - clad men crawling over her body to save her blushes it 's designed to appeal to one direction fans and i have no doubt that this will be flying off the shelves			2
the least expensive bottle is £ 21 for 30ml , but it 's truly a smell you 'll need to fall in love with before you part with a penny of your pocket money			1
@entity5 has held off doing any additional promotion as the fragrance is likely to sell out within the first few days of going on sale			0
