@entity1 co-chairman @entity0 says @entity2 has built the best squad since he bought the club , and has re-introduced the ' @entity1 way '			1
the @entity1 sit seventh in the @entity6 , having won three of their opening seven fixtures , after @entity2 was backed in the transfer market over the summer			1
it is a far cry from last season when , in the midst of an injury crisis , the club 's fans were calling on co-owners @entity0 and @entity18 to replace @entity2 - with many pointing at the style of play as their main gripe with the former @entity23 and @entity24 boss			1
@entity2 was criticised last season but has got @entity1 playing better football this year @entity2 has moved @entity26 to the centre of midfield as part of a tactical adjustment this season but @entity0 believes the 59 - year - old deserves credit for adopting a diamond formation which has brought the best out of the likes of @entity26 , as well as new signings @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
' there is a lot of optimism about the place now , ' @entity0 told the @entity44			1
' i genuinely believe we have the best squad since we 've been at the club			0
we 've signed some high - energy , younger players and we have discovered the ' @entity1 way '			2
' he ( @entity2 ) changed the style after that to a diamond formation			2
@entity2 made that decision so he deserves the accolades because , had it not worked , he would have been castigated			0
' new signing @entity38 has been excellent since arriving , scoring five times in six games @entity38 and @entity26 celebrate after combining for a goal as @entity1 have made a strong start in the league victories over @entity65 and @entity66 , as well as an entertaining draw at @entity68 , have followed the new formation as @entity2 starts to win over his detractors			1
with a move the @entity73 coming ahead of the 2016/17 season , the pressure will be on to not only keep @entity1 in the @entity6 but to be a club striving for trophies - and @entity2 will hope to be the man who takes them into their new home			2
the owners opted to keep him at the helm at the end of last season despite the clamour to see him sacked but , with @entity2 's current deal expiring in the summer , it will depend on results between now and then as to whether he leads @entity1 into a fifth season			2
@entity91 and @entity92 midfielder @entity37 has been another exciting addition to @entity2 's squad @entity26 holds off @entity96 's @entity95 during one of @entity1 's three @entity6 wins @entity2 implements another tactical switch , for which @entity0 has given him plenty of praise ' we have a policy - and it 's as much for @entity2 as us - that we sit down at the end of the season , maybe a bit earlier if we 're safe , and judge things over an entire season , ' @entity0 added			1
' we 've always done it that way			0
last year i was being asked at various times if @entity2 would be going but my answer was always that we 'd look at it at the end of the campaign			0
we 're very loyal to our managers ' we always talk on a monday or the day after a midweek match and if he has a problem he calls me			0
we all want the same thing and that is the best for this club			0
@entity2 wants to be successful and he 's very flexible at looking at ways to achieve that			0
' the change in formation was not my idea - he 's the one who made that bold decision to change the strategy			0
' last season the @entity1 boss was booed by his own fans after a victory against 10 - man @entity68 @entity0 believes @entity2 has proved his doubters wrong with the club 's impressive start to this season			1

@entity1 have picked up 10 points from their first seven games
@entity2 has switched formation to accommodate signings
@entity0 says ' there is a lot of optimism about the place now '
