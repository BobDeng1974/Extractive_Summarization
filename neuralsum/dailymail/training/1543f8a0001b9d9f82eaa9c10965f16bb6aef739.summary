scientists have uncovered a remarkable parallel between the way humans build cities on @entity5 and how galaxies form in space			1
they say how galaxies evolve is mathematically equivalent to the way settlements grow			1
@entity11 linguist @entity10 noticed that if cities are listed according to size , then the rank of a city is inversely proportional to the number of people who live in it			1
scientists have uncovered a remarkable parallel between the way humans build cities on @entity5 and how galaxies form in space			2
pictured on the left is @entity24 , and on the right galaxy @entity25 for instance , if the largest city in a country has a population of 10 million , the second - biggest will have a population of five million ( 10 divided by 2 ) , and the third a population of 2.5 million			0
' @entity34 's law ' is a scaling law			2
it can also be found in the strange fact that whether one person will be friends with another , is inversely proportional to the number of people who live closer to the first person than the second			2
but while scientists know the law to be true , they have no idea why it works			0
now researchers claim they have the source of these scaling laws in space , according to @entity52			0
@entity53 and @entity54 at the @entity55 in @entity56 have used models for showing how galaxies evolve to create a theory for scaling laws on @entity5			1
@entity11 linguist @entity10 noticed that if cities are listed according to size , then the rank of a city is inversely proportional to the number of people who live in it ( shown by the black dots )			1
the blue dashed line shows how the population is predicted to behave according to @entity72 's law ' we treat the population density as the fundamental quantity , thinking of cities as objects that form when the population density exceeds a critical threshold , ' @entity53 and @entity54 wrote in their research paper			1
' the situation is therefore conceptually and mathematically analogous to the formation of galaxies in the universe			0
' according to a report by @entity87 , the team used models governing the spread of galaxies , to show that this approach works for urban growth			0
they then analysed any variations in the density , and used equations to predict how this density can grow over time			0
' the results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction across a broad range of spatial scales , from a few km to âˆ¼ 10 ^ 3 km. ' their research suggests human behaviour on a massive scale follows the same patterns as galaxy growth			0
they believe this unifying theory for scaling law , can also be used to predict other phenomenon , such as the spread of disease			0

this relationship is known as the scaling law , and can also be found in the strange fact that whether one person will be friends with another , is inversely proportional to the number of people who live closer to the first person than the second			1
another example of @entity72 's law is in language			1
it states that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table			2
this means the most frequent word will occur twice as often as the second most frequent word , three times as often as the third most frequent word .			0

the way settlements grow are governed by something known as ' @entity72 's law '
law says rank of a city is inversely proportional to the number of *residents*
scientists have used models for showing how galaxies evolve to propose a theory for scaling laws in human populations on @entity5
