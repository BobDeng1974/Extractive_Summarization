by @entity0 published : 20:27 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 03:06 est , 21 february 2014 pensioners should be handed a stamp duty tax break to persuade them to downsize and make room for younger families , experts said last night			2
hundreds of thousands of older people are living in family - sized homes which are far too big for their needs and are often too expensive for them to heat			1
but many are deterred from moving into smaller accommodation because of the prohibitive costs of stamp duty , which can add up to thousands of pounds			1
it means that large homes are being under - used which would be perfect for younger families waiting to get on the housing ladder			2
spacious : the move could help free up larger properties for large families			2
file picture manageable : many older people are deterred from moving into smaller accommodation because of the prohibitive costs of stamp duty @entity24 the @entity28 is calling for stamp duty to be removed altogether when older homeowners in receipt of pension credit downsize to smaller properties			1
they say this would allow the country to ‘ make optimum use ’ of available housing stock			0
the idea is contained in a submission to chancellor @entity41 in advance of the @entity43 next month			1
the @entity28 ’s chief executive , @entity45 ( correct ) @entity44 , said : ‘ when older people on lower incomes want to move from a home that has become too big and expensive for their needs , stamp duty can stand in their way			1
‘ removing stamp duty when older home owners who receive pension credit move to smaller properties would make downsizing more affordable and would also free up bigger homes for larger families			1
’ the @entity28 is calling for stamp duty to be removed altogether when older homeowners in receipt of pension credit downsize to smaller properties in its submission , the @entity28 said the chancellor could also use the budget to tackle the housing crisis by taking steps to help councils build an extra 75,000 new homes , increase standards and choice in the private rented sector , and increase the rate at which homes sold under @entity72 to buy are replaced			2
they called on mr @entity41 to allow councils to borrow more so they can build new homes			1
increasing local authority borrowing caps by £ 7billion would allow them to build 75,000 new homes over five years , creating 23,500 jobs and creating £ 5.6billion of economic activity			0
the institute said the @entity82 could look at new ways of improving standards in the private rented sector by targeting tax allowances			0
private landlords currently benefit from around £ 7billion of tax allowances per year for deductible expenses such as repairs and maintenance , insurance and professional fees , but these allowances do not target or incentivise higher standards			0
if landlords who committed to a higher level of standards benefited from an enhanced allowance , while those who did not saw their allowances stay the same or even reduce , government could incentivise higher standards without the need for additional resourcing			0
mr @entity41 should also amend right to buy rules to increase the rate at which replacement homes are built , they said			1
current rules on the money generated from right to buy sales mean that local authorities are often left with insufficient funds to finance the building of replacement homes			0
changing the rules would ensure that councils always have enough money available to fund replacement homes while at the same time meeting the government ’s target that receipts should fund no more than 30 per cent of the cost of each new home			0
ms @entity44 said : ‘ we need to build 250,000 homes a year to keep up with our growing population , but we ’ve been failing to reach that target for decades - the result is a housing crisis in which millions of people are being denied access to a decent home at a price they can afford			2
the @entity43 offers the government a chance to address this and at the same time harness housing ’s potential to boost economic growth			0
’ she added : ‘ with more and more people living in the private rented sector - including more older people and more families with children - it ’s vital that we look carefully at new ways to raise standards			1
‘ we are concerned that the government ’s claim that it can provide one new affordable home for each one sold through @entity72 to buy will not prove to be the case			0
truly affordable housing is already at a premium - amending the rules could help increase the rate at which replacement homes are built			0

costs can mount up to thousands , deterring older people from moving
idea will be *submitted* to @entity41 next month
