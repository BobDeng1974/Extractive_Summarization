move over @entity0 - the ideal female body shape is leggy , tall and thin like @entity2 , not short and busty with a big bottom like the @entity6 reality tv star , claim scientists			1
a major study involving almost 60,000 volunteers rating almost 1,000 variations of the female figure discovered tall and slender is more attractive than curvy and hourglass - shaped			1
it is a result which contradicts the views of millions attracted over the decades to the more voluptuous pin ups from @entity16 to @entity17			0
a complex series of visual tests were conducted by researchers from the @entity34 in @entity35 for the specialist journal @entity37			0
they created computerised images of different female body shapes based on 24 basic factors from bust and bottom size to length of legs and waist circumference			1
a first ' generation ' of 120 of these were rated by volunteers from all over the world responding to a social media campaign asking for help			0
the 60 body shapes with the lowest ratings were eliminated			1
each of the remaining 60 were then taken and a slight variation of each was added to create another 120 shapes			2
@entity2 is known for showing off her long limbs in short dresses whilst performing on stage again , they were rated by volunteers and the bottom 60 eliminated and the process was repeated for eight ' generations ' - a total of 960 different shapes and sizes of female body			1
what the researchers found was that in every generation , the 60 lowest rated body shapes were generally the fattest , shortest and roundest of the computerised figures			1
by the end of the eighth generation , the highest rated female form was tall with a small waist and long , slender legs , a smaller bottom and smaller bust said the researchers			0
overall , nearly 60,000 volunteers took part in the ratings of whom 80 per cent were men and from all over the world			1
the report admitted that an ideal female body shape was still very much a matter of opinion - athletic men like athletic women , for instance , and different cultures had different tastes			1
the researchers identified 24 female ' body traits ' most commonly found on a sample of 273 women from government census - style data			2
this included the obvious like bust size and shape and even ' volume ' , length of legs , waist size but also the slope of the shoulders , circumference of lower legs and girth of biceps			2
it also looked at ' seat prominence ' - in others words , a big bottom - and overall height and shape of torso			2
they created 20 composite female figures incorporating different traits so they all looked very different from each other			0
but each of these 20 then had five ' daughters ' - that is , five versions of each but with very subtle changes to some of the body traits , so a total of 120 figures were created			2
volunteers were shown side and front on profiles of these women but the faces were pixilated in order for them to be rated purely on body shape and physical features			1
the top 60 for ratings were taken to the next stage and each of these had two different versions , one slightly bigger different from the other creating another 120 figures			0
again , the top 60 went on , made into two version of each female shape and the 120 rated by another set of volunteers and so on for eight ' generations ' each one eliminating the most unpopular figures			2
as each generation progressed , the favoured shape evolved into a taller , slimmer female figure with long , slender legs and a thin waist			0
these were then rated by volunteers from all over the world who answered a social media and other adverts to take part			0
overall , 59,268 took part of whom 80 per cent were male			0
walking through @entity167 showed off her curvier figure , the new research claims to provide some of the most extensive research on female body shapes but overall it suggests tall and thin is preferred to short and curvy			1
it said : ' no study of a subject as complex as body shape attractiveness can provide all the answers			1
' but it said the study ' provides the most comprehensive and detailed insight yet into which traits constitute the actual targets of selection			0
' the predominant evolutionary trend , reflecting a likely major dimension of social selection operating on human female bodies , is toward greater slenderness and , particularly , narrower waists			0
' the selection process in the research ' removed those physiques that appeared most overweight , and throughout the experiment we found evidence for strong directional selection on the waist , which was accompanied by lengthening of the legs and a reduction in seat girth , resulting in taller and more slender physiques			0

scientists claim @entity2 has the most desired body shape
both men and women prefer the longer limbed thinner look
over 60,000 *people* took part in the experiment rating body shapes
