and if you did n’t understand most of that , then you may want to phone a friend			1
for all are terms invented to describe the perils of mobile phones			1
they are among a list of 1,000 new words and phrases included in the @entity16 , a special section of the latest edition of the @entity18 that focuses on how our language is evolving			1
from the latest edition of the @entity18 that focuses on how language is evolving a ‘ notspot ’ is an area where there is no phone signal , the opposite of a hotspot ; ‘ ringxiety ’ is a feeling of slight panic when you hear a phone with an identical ringtone to yours ; and ‘ intexication ’ is the state of distraction experienced when sending a text message			2
@entity38 is one of the many faces that can be classed as a ' celebutante ' not all the new words , or neologisms , are phone - related			1
another to have entered common usage , among younger generations at least , is ‘ butters ’ , an insult that is short for the @entity48 phrase ‘ butt ugly ’			2
and the rise of the likes of famous heiresses @entity53 and @entity38 has led to use of the word ‘ celebutante ’ , a cross between ‘ celebrity ’ and ‘ debutante ’			2
to get into the official dictionary , a word must stand the test of time			0
but the thesaurus ’s @entity64 , which means ‘ jumble ’ , includes words that may simply be a passing fad			1
