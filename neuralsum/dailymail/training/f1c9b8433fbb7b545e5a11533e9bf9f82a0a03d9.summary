@entity1 sen. @entity0 went on the attack against former secretary of state and potential 2016 rival @entity4 on friday night at a dinner in his home state			1
@entity0 reportedly blasted @entity8 for not doing more to prevent the assault on the @entity11 consulate in @entity12 , @entity13 , two years ago and made jokes at @entity8 's expense about her personal wealth			1
' i certainly wish that maybe she becomes preoccupied with something else because i do n't think she 's fit to lead the country , ' @entity0 said of @entity8 's presidential prospects , according to the @entity23			1
@entity1 sen. @entity24 was full of jokes about former secretary of state @entity4 's money problems this weekend speaking about @entity12 later in his remarks , @entity0 again attempted to discredit @entity8 , saying it was irresponsible of her not to read the messages that late @entity13 ambassador @entity31 sent the @entity32 in the days leading up to the terrorist attack			1
@entity8 has claimed numerous times that she could n't have possibly read all of the cables sent to @entity32 every day nor would it have been a proper use of her time as the department head			0
' if you do n't read the cables from one of the most dangerous spots on earth , frankly , you preclude yourself from ever being our commander in chief , ' @entity0 stated			2
the @entity47 lawmaker also claimed that @entity8 gave the @entity12 outpost the same level of deference ' as if it were @entity51			2
' ' @entity12 's not @entity51			2
@entity12 is a lot like @entity54 , ' he reportedly said			0
perhaps the @entity32 could have afforded more security at the @entity13 consulate if it had n't spent $ 100,000 on an electrical charging station at the embassy in @entity59 , @entity60 , or $ 700,000 on landscaping for the embassy in @entity62 , @entity63			0
' @entity24 voted to shut down the government , wants the @entity11 to retreat from our responsibilities around the world , opposes commonsense legislation like the @entity69 and equal pay legislation , and thinks employers ought to have the right to discriminate			0
with that record , he 's got no credibility on the issue of who is fit to lead , ' @entity74 spokesman @entity73 told the @entity23			1
@entity0 joked that he had lost sleep over the financial woes of @entity8 , who was spotted this weekend outside the @entity82 in @entity83			1
' i hope she can deal with only 100 million , ' @entity0 said , referring to @entity8 and her husband 's estimated net worth @entity0 also took shots at @entity8 's comments that her family was ' dead broke ' when @entity93 's presidency ended in 2001			1
after asking the audience to observe ' a moment of silence ' for @entity8 , @entity0 joking said , ' somebody must have been praying for her because she 's now worth 100 , 200 million			1
' ' i tell you it was really tough giving those speeches , ' he said , referring to the large pot of money @entity8 has made on the speaking circuit since resigning as secretary of state in early 2013			0
@entity8 often charges $ 200,000 or more to appear before groups and has made an estimated $ 6 million off the arrangements			2
she and her husband have an approximate combined net worth of $ 100 million , as @entity0 mentioned			1
' i hope she can deal with only 100 million , ' @entity0 said , playing off his previous joke			2
mocking @entity8 's admission in january that she has n't driven a car since 1996 , @entity0 said at least ' she had her limo driver with her for the last 17 years to commiserate			1
' at the beginning of his remarks , @entity0 said in jest that he 'd been losing sleep over @entity8 's money problems			1
@entity0 was full of jokes this weekend			2
at an annual picnic in @entity123 , @entity1 , the following day @entity0 recited a poem about fellow @entity1 sen. @entity126 's opponent , @entity125			1
@entity125 is running against the @entity47 leader in the general election that will take place in november			0
' there once was a woman from @entity1 , who thought in politics she ’d be lucky			0
' so she flew to @entity134 for a @entity136 bash			0
she came home in a flash with buckets of cash , ' @entity0 said , per @entity141			0
' to liberals , she whispers : coal makes you sick			0
in @entity1 , she claims coal makes us tick			0
' to the liberals , she sells her soul — the same ones who hate @entity1 coal			0
' one thing we know is true , one thing we know is guaranteed , she ’d cast her first vote for @entity155 , ' @entity0 said , name dropping current senate majority leader @entity155 , who will have to run for re-election as a party leader when the new @entity159 convenes next year			0
' @entity125 ’ real pledge is to @entity161 ; her first vote is to @entity155 ; as for @entity1 , if that happens , it ’s too bad indeed , ' @entity0 concluded			2
after an eventful weekend in @entity1 , @entity0 traveled to all - important presidential primary state @entity164 , where he plans to attend events for the next several days			1
@entity159 is recess until september , giving possible presidential contenders who serve at the federal level five uninterrupted weeks to test out their campaign apparatuses before officially announcing their candidacies next year .			0

@entity0 said @entity8 had precluded herself ' from ever being our commander in chief ' by acting irresponsibly in the days leading up to the @entity12 attack
with the record @entity0 has in the @entity181 ' he 's got no credibility on the issue of who is fit to lead , ' a @entity179 spokesman fired back
during his remarks @entity0 also held a mock ' moment of silence ' for @entity8
' somebody must have been praying for her because she 's now worth 100 , 200 million , ' he joked afterward
@entity0 was in playful mood this weekend ; on *saturday* he performed a poem making fun of @entity1 's @entity74 @entity181 candidate
