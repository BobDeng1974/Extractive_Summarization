the debate that has raged about whether @entity1 were a sub-species of modern humans may finally be over			1
researchers have identified new evidence supporting the growing belief that @entity1 were a distinct species separate from modern humans ( homo sapiens ) and deserve a more distinct identity of their own			1
experts studied the nasal complex of @entity1 to also conclude that their extinction was probably due to competition with modern humans , and not their inability to adapt to a cooling climate			1
experts studied the nasal complex of @entity1 ( a skull dating from 50,000 @entity21 is pictured ) and say that its features evolved separately to modern humans , suggesting that @entity1 were a distinct species separate from @entity9 and deserve a more distinct identity of their own the research , led by @entity29 , in @entity27 , indicates that the @entity1 nasal complex was not inferior , but simply different , to that of modern humans			1
@entity33 , associate professor at the @entity29 ’s @entity34 and his team said that previous studies into the @entity1 nose have compared @entity1 nasal dimensions to modern human populations such as the @entity40 and modern @entity41 , whose nasal complexes are adapted to cold and temperate climates			1
however , the current study , published in @entity45 , adds to a growing body of evidence that the upper respiratory tracts of this extinct group functioned via a different set of rules			1
this is because the structures have as a separate evolutionary history and features not found among any population of humans			0
dr @entity33 explained : ‘ the strategy was to have a comprehensive examination of the nasal region of diverse modern human population groups and then compare the data with the fossil evidence			2
the study revealed that the extinction of @entity1 was probably due to competition with modern humans , not their inability to adapt to a cooling climate			1
a hunting scene is illustrated a genome taken from a 36,000 - year - old skeleton has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between humans and @entity1			2
the study of @entity78 recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known @entity41 - a man who lived in @entity81 - shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the @entity85 , helping sow the seed for the modern - day population			0
the @entity89 genome revealed a small percentage of @entity1 genes , confirming previous results that found neanderthals and the first humans to leave @entity95 for @entity41 , briefly interbred			2
lead author dr @entity96 , of the @entity97 at @entity98 , said the work reveals a framework with which to explore how humans responded to climate change , encounters with other populations , and the dynamic landscapes of the @entity85 , for the first time			0
the study allows scientists to more accurately estimate when interbreeding occurred - around 54,000 years ago			0
experts think that a ‘ meta - population ’ of hunter - gatherers with deep shared ancestry managed to survive through the last @entity85 and colonise the landmass of @entity41 for more than 30,000 years			0
‘ we used traditional morphometrics , geometric morphometric methodology based on @entity115 coordinate data , and ct imaging			0
’ @entity118 , anatomy instructor at @entity119 , who co-authored the study , collected 3d data from fossils in @entity41 museums			0
the team looked at this data and other sets of information to ‘ have a feel for where these @entity1 may lie among the human spectrum ’			0
@entity132 , director of the @entity133 of the @entity134 , also in @entity27 , said that while the external nasal aperture ( the pear - shaped opening of the skull ) of @entity1 is similar to that of some human populations , their protrusion of the midface ( midfacial prognathism ) is ‘ startlingly different ’			0
that difference is one of a number of @entity1 nasal traits suggesting an evolutionary development distinct from that of modern humans			1
@entity151 , of the @entity134 , believes that the study is a significant contribution to the question of @entity1 cold adaptation in the nasal region , especially in its identification of a different number of features than those of cold - adapted modern humans			1
his previous work has shown that there are clear differences in the vocal tract proportions of fossil humans when compared to modern humans			2
he said : ‘ the strength of this new research lies in its taking the totality of the @entity1 nasal complex into account , rather than looking at a single feature			1
‘ by looking at the complete morphological pattern , we can conclude that @entity1 are our close relatives , but they are not us			0
’ @entity177 , of the @entity178 , who was not involved in the study commented : ‘ @entity33 and colleagues have carried out a most provocative and intriguing investigation of a very significant complex in the @entity1 skull that has all too frequently been overlooked			2
’ he hopes that future studies will demonstrate ‘ once and for all ’ that @entity1 deserve a distinctive identify of their own .			0

*anthropologists* studied the nasal complex of @entity1
they say it has features that evolved separately from modern humans
@entity1 *'s* extinction was probably due to competition with modern humans , not their inability to adapt to a cooling climate , study reveals
research adds to growing body of evidence that the upper respiratory tracts of this extinct group functioned via a different set of rules
