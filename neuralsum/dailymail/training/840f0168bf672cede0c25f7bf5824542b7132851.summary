by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 30 august 2013 a schoolgirl was sent home just hours after starting the new term after teachers insisted her trousers were too tight			1
fourteen - year - old @entity6 had just rejoined friends after their summer holidays and taken her first steps into preparing for gcse exams			2
but the @entity12 student was pulled to one side by furious staff at @entity15 , @entity16 , and told to change her trousers or go home			1
some 25 children were given their marching orders or put into isolation for breaking the secondary school ’s ‘ zero tolerance ’ uniform rules			1
@entity6 ’s mother , @entity24 , 44 , was contacted by the school on thursday to be told her daughter was not allowed into her classes			2
she said : ' i personally think @entity6 ’s trousers were suitable - i do n’t think they were too tight at all			2
i think it ’s disgusting			0
she ’s being deprived of an education			0
' i know at least two other parents who are furious about it			0
ca n’t they just educate the children until 3pm and then send them home with a letter ? ' head teacher @entity37 , who has overseen seven years of academic improvement at the school , said the hard line was important for school discipline , and that no children were sent home unless their parents were there waiting for them			1
fourteen year - old @entity6 ( left ) was sent home from school after teachers said her trousers were too tight ' we ’ve changed our school uniform and we anticipated having hiccups , which is why we posted letters to students ’ homes with precise descriptions and had two or three assemblies with the pupils , ' said ms @entity37			1
' we made it really clear they would be put in isolation or sent home if they did not wear the uniform			1
' about 20 to 25 out of 1,050 pupils were in the wrong clothes or shoes and , if their parents could be contacted , they were sent home and , if not , they were put in isolation			2
” ms @entity37 added : ' schools such as @entity71 in challenging areas do n’t get to be successful without being clear and rigorous			0
' @entity15 in @entity16 said the hard line was necessary for school discipline			1
25 other pupils were sent home on the first day of term yesterday ' we know there were parents who were hacked off with us over the uniform but we do n’t imagine they will be so hacked off when their children get good results			1
' in the past , pupils in years seven , eight and nine had their own uniform , while older students were asked to wear black and white , with certain restrictions on styles			0
the new uniform is designed for students of all year groups			0
boys must wear a white shirt , school tie , black trousers and a black blazer , while girls have the same uniform with the option of wearing a knee - length skirt instead of trousers			0
ms @entity37 said part of the reason for the new uniform was to avoid having ‘ ridiculous ’ conversations about what the rules were			0
the school ’s website includes a guide with illustrations of what styles of clothes are acceptable .			0
