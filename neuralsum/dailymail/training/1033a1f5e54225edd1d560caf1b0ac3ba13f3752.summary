tempting though keeping some of the gifts might be , @entity10 is at pains to point out that none of the royals are allowed to keep the presents for themselves			2
' official gifts are not the private property of the member of the @entity4 who receives them but are instead received in an official capacity in the course of official duties , ' explains a palace source			0
