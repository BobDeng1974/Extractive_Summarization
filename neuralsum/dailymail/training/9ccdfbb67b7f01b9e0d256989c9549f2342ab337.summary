six - year - old @entity0 is celebrating a huge milestone after entering remission from her cancer			2
the primary school student , from @entity5 , has spent a physically and emotionally draining past couple of years battling leukaemia			2
while fighting the deadly disease , @entity8 also succumbed to @entity10 and pneumonia , and she had to learn to walk again after the cancer treatment severely damaged her bones			1
@entity8 , six , from @entity5 , was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2013			1
she also battled with @entity10 and pneumonia and had to learn to walk again after cancer treatment damaged her bones it is a miracle that @entity8 is has made such a full recovery as her cancer was missed several times by doctors before she was finally diagnosed			1
she first showed signs of illness aged four , when her concerned parents took her to the local gp surgery after she started suffering from lethargy and a string of other ailments			2
over the course of a few months , they made repeated visits to the doctors and nearby hospital but were usually sent home with antibiotics			2
speaking to @entity39 about discovering the real reason @entity8 was always pale , tired and had aching legs , her mother @entity38 , said : ' we were on a family holiday in @entity44 and began to worry because she complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair			1
' she was starting school soon and i thought " this ca n't be right " but we had been back and forth to the doctors and no one had picked up on anything			0
' @entity8 was always pale , tired and had aching legs			1
but her mother @entity38 really began to worry when her daughter complained about lethargy and aching legs and wanted to use a pushchair at the age of four the chemotherapy drugs that were saving @entity8 's life were also suppressing her immune system			1
she withdrew into herself , unable to understand why everyone was ' hurting ' her but her parents remained as positive as they could by trying to make hospital stays ' fun ' with arts and crafts it was n't until one of @entity8 's aunts , who worked as a receptionist at the local hospital , recognised the telltale signs for leukaemia and advised @entity38 to take her daughter for a blood test			1
@entity38 said : ' she noticed some tell - tale signs such as tiny red spots around her eyes and on her nose , she also noticed how easily her skin bruised after wearing a helmet while she was on a scooter			1
' the aunt advised @entity38 and her partner @entity84 to take @entity8 straight to hospital and demand a blood test			1
she was admitted within the hour			0
@entity38 said : ' we presumed they might say she had an iron deficiency but nothing prepared us for the news we received			1
' @entity38 and @entity84 were taken into a private room and told their little girl had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia			1
speaking about receiving the news , @entity38 said : ' never in a million years did we expect to hear that			1
' that day we had been running around a farm looking at the animals and now we were frantically trying to find a bed for our little girl in a cancer ward			0
' @entity84 added : ' nothing can prepare you for that moment			0
shock , dread , fear , anguish and desperation were just some of the words that hit us and lived with us over the next months			0
' we felt like we were being driven in a car we had no control over			0
' things were explained to us but we found it so hard to take in among the tears and anxiety			0
' we went through hopeless bouts of self - doubt , questioning " why our daughter ? "			0
' @entity8 was finally able to start school in may , although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk			1
three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg , due to a calcium deficiency caused by the effects of the chemotherapy and steroids @entity8 was transferred to @entity131 and given the first of many chemotherapy drugs before being transferred to the @entity134 in @entity135			1
but there was worse to come			0
the chemotherapy drugs that were saving @entity8 ’s life were also suppressing her immune system			1
@entity8 also withdrew into herself , unable to understand why everyone was ' hurting ' her			1
her speech dropped away and the steroids she was taking brought on mood swings and tantrums			0
her leg muscles were also affected , making it difficult to walk			2
after 10 days in hospital , they were allowed to take @entity0 home			0
for the next six weeks , they were in and out of hospital with a series of infections and also for her chemotherapy treatment			0
then one november morning , her temperature spiked and she had to be admitted to @entity159 , where her condition began to deteriorate rapidly			0
she was rushed back to the @entity134 where she was diagnosed with @entity10 and pneumonia and very low potassium levels			1
speaking about @entity8 's response to the ordeal , @entity38 said : ' while she will never now how close to death she was , it suddenly clicked that @entity8 was going to get better and things became more positive ' ( @entity8 pictured before her diagnosis ) @entity84 said : ' over the next three weeks , @entity8 drifted in and out of consciousness			1
she lost any appetite she had and withdrew further into herself			0
she appeared to be losing the fight			0
' but after four weeks @entity8 was allowed home with a feed pump and spent another 57 days in isolation because of her suppressed immune system			1
speaking about the ' intense ' months that followed , @entity38 said : ' she could n't walk and was in and out of hospital constantly			1
for eight weeks , she was in home isolation to minimise infection risk due to her low immune system			0
' her medicine was making her ill and she struggled to understand why this was happening			0
she rejected her father and grandparents and only wanted me , it was extremely tough			0
' @entity84 added : ' this raised our stress levels because inside we were crying too			0
' @entity8 was finally able to start school in may , although she had to use a wheelchair and frame as she re-learned to walk			1
three days into the summer holidays she broke her left leg , caused by the weakening effects of the chemotherapy and steroids and she has also broken her arm twice since			1

@entity38 said : ' while she will never know how close to death she was , @entity8 has fully appreciated her illness			1
@entity38 said : ' about four months in , she accepted what was happening , and was able to deal with it and that helped things became more positive			2
' @entity38 and @entity84 also employed positive tactics to keep all of their spirits up			2
