by @entity0 an academic who stripped off in front of 200 students during a lecture has been let off with a warning			1
dr @entity6 , an events management lecturer at @entity7 , stripped down to his underpants in an apparent attempt to teach his first - year students how to pitch to clients			1
the 51 - year - old began the striptease by draping his jacket over the front row of desks where the students were sitting			1
but dr @entity6 has been left off with a warning , following an investigation by @entity7			1
in a statement , the university said : ' an internal investigation has taken place			0
the @entity7 has clarified its expectations in lecture delivery and so the matter is now closed			1
' dr @entity50 did not want to comment on the incident , but did not deny any of the claims			2
he said : ' the university is a big institution			0
all communication must go through them			0
i am happy for my response to come through them			0
' a source added : ' he is still in post			0
he has been given a warning but no sanctions			0
' the bizarre incident took place while dr @entity6 was taking a lecturer in front of events management students about how to pitch to clients			1
stunned students went online soon after the incident , with one tweeting : ' i literally have no idea what is going on right now , why is my lecturer semi naked			1
. and now painting his face white			0
. ' and another told her friend : ' @entity6 is stripping and shaving to try and convey a point but i really have no clue what is going on ! ' a video of the incident was also posted online			2
it shows students chuckling in their seats as dr @entity6 marches around the front of the lecture hall , holding up his clothes			1
no students complained directly about the lecturer 's behaviour but the university launched an investigation after spotting the picture on @entity96			2
students in the lecture began tweeting their surprise as the incident unfolded another tweeted her friend say dr @entity6 was carrying out the performance to ' convey a point ' - but that she had no idea what was going on he was not suspended from the role during the investigation , but was not teaching during most of the interim period due to most students having finished for summer			1
dr @entity6 completed his phd in arts and culture policy at @entity114 in 2012 and has since studied political activism while lecturing on the £ 9,000 - a - year university course			1
in a recent interview with a careers website , he boasted about his ' ( cough ) " athletic physique " '			0
telling the website about his job , he said : ' what i am really enjoying is the combination of lecturing , particularly when i 'm in - front of a cohort of 200 plus events students in one of the larger lecture theatres , and research			1
it 's that voracious curiosity and performer in me i guess			0
an investigation was launched by @entity7 , pictured above , after the incident			2
a spokesman said the university had ' clarified its expectations in lecture delivery ' ' unless you are passionate you can not enthuse your students , your colleagues and , importantly , yourself			1
' @entity144 , chairman of the @entity145 , criticised both the lecturer and the university			0
he said : ' @entity7 lecturers should focus on teaching students rather than on stripping for them			2
' this episode brings higher education into disrepute			0
it illustrates an arrogant contempt for students ; many of whom make sacrifices to attend university and incur considerable debt			2
' equally worrying is that @entity7 has recently had its standards and quality confirmed by “ the @entity163 ( @entity163 )			0
' this means it can market itself under the @entity164 to prospective student in the @entity166 and abroad			0
