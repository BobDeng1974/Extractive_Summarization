research suggests that some @entity2 lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere			2
this counters a widely - held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming			1
the study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish , leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption			1
the research challenges the widely - held view that thawing lakes cause warming			1
found in the @entity2 and cold mountain regions , thermokarst lakes ( shown ) occur when permafrost thaws and creates surface depressions that fill with water rising levels of water vapour high above the @entity34 are likely to intensify the effects of global warming in coming decades , say scientists			1
the increasing amounts of water in the upper troposphere are a direct result of human activity , research suggests			0
computer simulations predict that as burning fossil fuels warms the climate , concentrations of water vapour will rise			0
the moistening of the atmosphere in turn absorbs more heat and raises the @entity34 ’s temperature further			0
to investigate these effects scientists measured levels of water vapour in the upper troposphere , a region three to seven miles above the @entity34 ’s surface			0
their findings were compared with climate model predictions of water circulation between the ocean and atmosphere			0
the results showed that increasing levels of atmospheric water vapour could not be explained by natural forces such as volcanoes or changes in solar activity			0
but they did appear to be linked to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide			0
lead scientist professor @entity75 , from the @entity76 , @entity77 , said : ' the study is the first to confirm that human activities have increased water vapour in the upper troposphere			0
' supported by the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , the study was published this week in the journal @entity84 and focused on thermokarst lakes			2
these occur when permafrost thaws and create surface depressions that fill with melted fresh water , converting what was previously frozen land into lakes			0
the research suggests that @entity2 thermokarst lakes are ' net climate coolers ' when observed over longer time scales , namely several thousand years , although they initially warm the climate			1
' until now , we 've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming , ' said lead researcher dr @entity102 , associate research professor at the @entity103			1
' it is true that they do warm climate by strong methane emissions when they first form , but on a longer - term scale , they switch to become climate coolers because they ultimately soak up more carbon from the atmosphere than they ever release			1
' the researchers observed that roughly 5,000 years ago , thermokarst lakes in ice - rich regions of @entity21 and @entity20 began cooling , instead of warming the atmosphere			1
' while methane and carbon dioxide emissions following thaw lead to immediate radiative warming , carbon uptake in peat - rich sediments occurs over millennial time scales , ' the authors write			2
they found that high rates of carbon absorption in lake sediments were stimulated by several factors including erosion and nutrient release from thawing permafrost			0
' until now , we 've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming , ' said lead researcher dr @entity102 ( shown ) , associate research professor at the @entity103 ' these lakes are being fertilised by thawing yedoma permafrost , ' explained co-author dr @entity142 , a research geologist for the @entity143			1
@entity144 is a type of permafrost that is rich in organic material , which means mosses and other plants flourish in the lakes			1
this leads to increased carbon uptake rates that are among the highest in the world			0
the study also revealed another major factor of this process : when the lakes drain , previously thawed organic - rich lake sediments re-freeze			2
the new permafrost formation then stores a large amount of carbon processed in and under thermokarst lakes , as well as the peat that formed after lake drainage			2
researchers note that the new carbon storage is not forever , since future warming will likely start re-thawing some of the permafrost and release some of the carbon in it via microbial decomposition			0
as roughly 30 per cent of global permafrost carbon is concentrated within 7 per cent of the permafrost region in @entity20 , @entity176 and @entity21 , this study 's findings also renew scientific interest in how carbon uptake by thermokarst lakes offsets greenhouse gas emissions .			1

study says ice - rich lakes in @entity20 and @entity21 are cooling the atmosphere
research challenges the widely - held view that thawing lakes cause warming
suggests so - called thermokarst lakes that form when permafrost thaws are net climate coolers over thousands of years
this is because mosses and other plants flourish , absorbing carbon
but when the lakes first form their methane emission does warm the climate according to the scientists
