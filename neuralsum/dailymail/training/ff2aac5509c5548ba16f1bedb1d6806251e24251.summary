@entity0 and @entity1 have experienced rather similar seasons in quite a few respects			1
@entity4 and @entity5 have come under pressure in relatively equal measure but seem to have ridden the storm for now			1
neither possess a defence you would happily lock your valuables behind , nor a goalkeeper to store too much faith in – or his understudy			0
attacking flair has been present but ultimately each have underwhelmed so far			0
both @entity4 ( left ) and @entity5 have been under pressure to improve results this season but usually there is a a sharp edge to matches between these two and sunday at @entity23 promises an intriguing contest			1
each side needs a result to boost the positive shoots of recent victories			0
in goal @entity0 are likely to turn once again to @entity30 , who has shown in two games why it took so long for @entity33 to get shifted to the bench			1
diving out of the way for @entity37 ’s goal at @entity38 like an out - of - control @entity40 player was bad enough , before his error for @entity43 ’s consolation in the @entity44			0
@entity45 will be in net for @entity1 and on occasion can look the commanding keeper @entity5 wants			2
but he remains unconvincing at an elite level that the likes of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are on			0
@entity4 has turned to back up goalkeeper @entity30 following @entity33 's poor form @entity1 fans remain unconvinced by current @entity57 goalkeeper @entity45 in front are two defences that have been roundly criticised repeatedly			1
@entity0 ’s has got worse than last season under @entity4 and at times seems to have as much organisation as a @entity64 dance floor when the free bar has been drained			2
@entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68 fall some way short of a side with @entity72 aspirations , while @entity4 ’ three - at - the - back formation is yet to impress			2
on the @entity1 front , @entity74 was slaughtered for his bizarre display in the defeat at @entity78 while @entity79 needs time to settle			0
he is playing many more minutes than in his breakthrough season at @entity81			0
injuries have led to a muddled selection on occasion			0
but @entity1 overall have defenders , when fit , more comfortable in their roles , and this is borne out in the statistics			0
they have conceded 19 goals at a rate of 1.19 per game - the fifth best record in the @entity93			1
per @entity74 has struggled to find form after a busy summer with @entity96 @entity66 ( right ) has endured a tough start to his career as a @entity0 defender @entity5 looks on during his side 's 3 - 2 @entity93 defeat at the hands of @entity78 @entity0 have let in 22 to place 11th in the division in that aspect – at a rate of 1.38 per game			1
the pressure put on their defence is shown by their far greater number of blocks , clearances , and interceptions made : 804 ( ninth - highest ) to @entity1 ’s 660 ( 18th )			2
@entity0 ’s options in midfield are myriad but the new signings have yet to spark			0
@entity117 has probably done best so far			0
@entity118 looks like a man frustrated that a talent like @entity121 is no longer on the end of his passes			0
@entity118 has cut a frustrated figure for the majority of the season so far @entity118 looks on as @entity128 players celebrate during @entity0 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity38 @entity1 have possibly even more options in this area , with @entity132 improving , @entity133 beginning to find his feet again , and @entity135 reinvigorated			1
unsurprisingly , each side ranks highly for short passes and some way down the list for long balls			0
@entity1 have made 8,417 short passes to come second , @entity0 7,018 to place seventh			1
long balls see @entity1 bottom ( 715 ) and @entity0 16th ( 915 )			2
overall completion levels are 85 per cent for @entity1 and 84 per cent for @entity0			2
in attack is where these teams divide clearest			0
@entity149 has been an instant hit , @entity148 looks in fine nick and @entity152 provides another option			0
@entity133 , seen his scoring against @entity155 , looked to be finding form before an injury setback @entity149 has hit the ground running for @entity1 , scoring nine @entity93 goals this season @entity148 scored twice during a 4 - 1 @entity93 win against @entity161 last weekend @entity162 has been out injured since the end of august and will spend @entity64 in @entity164 for @entity0 , @entity165 is yet to score in the @entity93 , @entity162 has struggled repeatedly with injury , and @entity168 ’s dream move has not quite turned out that way			1
@entity0 have only scored 19 goals and sit mid table in this regard ( 10th ) , while @entity1 have hit 28 to rank fourth in the division to date			1
total shots sees @entity1 on 194 ( second ) with @entity0 on 157 ( seventh ) while shots on target is 47 per cent for @entity1 and 45 per cent for @entity0			2
a small margin but it means @entity1 have the fourth best rate for shots testing the goalkeeper to @entity0 ’s 11th			1
a victory for @entity5 ’s mean on sunday would add credence to @entity0 detractors who believe those places could be replicated in the real @entity93 table come may			1
@entity0 's @entity165 is yet to score for @entity0 in the @entity93 @entity0 manager @entity4 and @entity165 have a discussion during training			1

@entity0 face @entity93 rivals @entity1 at @entity23 on sunday
@entity4 and @entity5 have both come under pressure in recent weeks
@entity1 are fifth in the @entity93 for goals conceded – 19 at a rate of 1.19 per game
@entity0 have let in 22 to place them 11th in the division – at a rate of 1.38 per game
@entity165 is yet to score a @entity93 goal for the @entity205 , while @entity162 has been *sidelined* with injury
@entity149 has been @entity1 's star signing , scoring nine goals in 16 @entity93 games
