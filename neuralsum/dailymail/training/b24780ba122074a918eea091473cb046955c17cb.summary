in a letter sent this week , they wrote : ' the recent revelations about your separation , and the fact that you , as the seeming " innocent " party , moved out of the house to let her and her new lover be there only serves to emphasise to outsiders that you are in thrall to @entity20 and are totally dominated by her			2
' we have noted that mr @entity22 appears to have an ongoing role as your transport adviser and this gives rise to question about your judgement			0
it also causes ambiguity about the future role of these two individuals in your office			0
none of this gives either the party or the public the impression that you are genuinely in charge of your work			0
