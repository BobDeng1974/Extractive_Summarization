by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 17 september 2013 with her washboard stomach and pert bottom , it 's not surprising @entity5 is often asked how she gets her enviable figure			1
now the @entity8 champion , who recently announced her retirement from international heptathlon , is letting people in on the secrets of her toned body			1
she 's become a personal trainer and has devised a new workout and nutritional plan , called the @entity17 , that 's designed to help people lose weight and shape up			1
the plan is based upon the @entity22 's own training methods but is aimed at beginners			1
enviable figure : @entity5 is often asked how she gets her toned abs , now you can find out with her new workout plan she told @entity28 : ' people always ask me " how do you get your arms and your bum like that ? and how do you get your abs ? " ' now i have the opportunity to share the knowledge and tricks of the trade that made me an elite athlete			1
personal trainer in your living room : @entity5 demonstrates workouts that can be followed in your own home simple but effective : @entity5 said the workouts are high intensity but suitable for beginners fight the fat : the plan involves moves and nutritional advice to help people lose weight and tone up ' the 60 day plan reflects what we do as athletes as we know what training we have planned for the next four weeks			2
i wanted to give the average person access to something like that			0
i hope i can be a role model and give people the information they need to better themselves			0
' the @entity17 is an online programme that people can subscribe to for £ 9.99 a month			1
they can then log in to access workout videos demonstrated by @entity5 and nutritional advice including meal plans			0
@entity69 - born @entity5 said the workouts are all ' simple but effective ' involving moves such as sit ups and burpees that you can do in your own home			2
golden girl : the heptathlete came first at the @entity78 in @entity79 @entity80 : @entity5 with fellow heptathletes @entity81 , ( left ) and @entity83			0
she wo n't carry on training to qualify for @entity85 due to a number of factors including lack of financial support she explained : ' i wanted to make it so people have no excuse not to exercise			1
the main excuse for exercising nowadays is " i do n't have time " and people ca n't always afford to join a gym or get a personal trainer			2
so i wanted to offer a solution to the average person to get them into fitness and kick start a new regime			2
' people get out of the habit of exercising and i wanted to create something that takes the stress away			0
it 's effectively a fitness dvd but streamed and available to you wherever you go			1
the workouts are 45 minutes long including the warm up and down			0
' @entity5 developed the nutritional side of the plan with @entity113 , who was her nutritionist in the build - up to the @entity115			1
@entity5 explained : ' it 's a low glycaemic , low carb diet and is based on portion sizes not calorie counting			1
having to count calories is just tedious and i wanted to create something that 's sustainable both in terms of fitness and nutrition			1
still training : although she 's retired from the heptathlon , she will keep running and plans to take part in a 10k for the @entity131 ' having to monitor every bite you put in your mouth seems ridiculous			1
you just need to know the nutrients and foods you need to put in your body to stay healthy			0
that 's the information we are providing			2
' she added : ' @entity141 should n't be a case of " today i 'm just eating celery "			0
it should be exciting and people should be able to look at a list of ingredients and create something tasty			0
' ' having to monitor every bite you put in your mouth seems ridiculous			0
you just need to know the foods you need to stay healthy ' the personal trainer said she 's seen ' amazing results ' with the people she 's worked with so far			2
' some lost 5kg in 26 days and 7cm around the waist , ' she said			0
' when i put the programme together i knew i needed to create a calorie deficient to ensure users will see results			0
' @entity5 's new fitness venture comes as she hangs up her track spikes , retiring from athletics at the relatively young age of 27			1
she has been competing at international level since the age of 15 , excelling at the seven different disciplines of the heptathlon in order to represent her country in the @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity172 , as well as the @entity115			1
the highlight of her career was a gold medal at the @entity8 in @entity79 in 2010			1
the @entity179 graduate admitted some have seen her retirement as premature but she said the time was right to pursue new opportunities due to a number of factors			1
she said : ' the @entity115 was an incredible time for me and i 've had a great career gaining a @entity8 gold medal			1
the @entity85 is another three years which is a long time to keep training			2
i wanted to do other things and explore opportunities that could be equally as exciting and rewarding			0
' it 's a personal decision and injury and illness has come into the equation			2
they can mean you train hard but still do n't fulfil your full potential on the day of competition			1
some people have been sad about me retiring but i 'm really enjoying it			0
i 've had an amazing opportunity to represent my country and it 's opened so many doors for me for which i 'm very grateful			2
' without bitterness , the heptathlon added that her ability to carry on as a full - time athlete till @entity85 was hindered by a lack of support from sport governing bodies and sponsors - as she was dropped from lottery funding and had no kit deal			1
she said : ' not having funding made it difficult for me to consider a long term future in the sport			2
we talk about @entity226 legacy but it remains to be seen for those athletes who did n't medal at the @entity231			0
the onus is on us to create our own @entity226 legacy			0
' there are athletes out there like @entity237 who has said he ca n't get a kit contract			0
that 's a basic you 'd expect for someone who has achieved an olympic gold medal			1
' it 's no surprise for me that there 's a struggle for funding in sport and i did n't want that to be an on - going battle for another four years			2
' she added : ' it 's difficult to keep going when you do n't have a means to stay on track			2
the heptathlon means training for seven events so it 's more than a full - time job			1
you have to be at the track five hours a day			0
i would train twice a day , six times a week			0
' if you can only fund that by getting a part - time job then you have to ask what you can achieve when you can only give it half your time			1
i had to be realistic			0
' on the plus side of retirement , @entity5 said she 's grateful she no longer has to run painful lactic acid inducing 800m races			2
but she does n't want to stop running altogether so she 's signed up for a new challenge - the @entity273 10k run on sunday 6th october			1
she 'll be taking part as an ambassador for the @entity131 - a cause that resonates with her as she lost her father to heart disease in 2008			1
she said : ' he had a heart attack and a stroke and spent six weeks in hospital before he passed away			0
it was tragic as he never got to see me compete in the @entity226			0
so i want to help give people information about how to have a healthy lifestyle and a healthy heart			0
' @entity5 is running the @entity289 on sunday 6th october , to sponsor her visit @entity290			0
to subscribe to @entity291 , visit @entity292			0

@entity8 gold medallist is often asked how she gets enviable figure
now she 's revealing all with fitness and diet plan , the @entity17
recently announced retirement from international heptathlon
said lack of financial support made it hard to carry on as full - time athlete
she 'll keep on running and is planning 10k for @entity131
