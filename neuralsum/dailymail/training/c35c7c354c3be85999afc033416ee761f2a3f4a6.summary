residents of @entity1 have never viewed their neighbourhood as anything other than the nondescript village @entity4 that it is			2
the idea that those mundane redbrick terrace homes were touched by legend might have raised a northern chuckle or two			0
but that was the reality villagers were coming to terms with last night after a historian declared the street , in @entity16 , near @entity17 , is the most likely location of @entity19 , the mythical court of @entity20			1
residents of @entity1 , road sign pictured , said they were ' stunned ' to discover their lane has been named as the epicentre of @entity20 legend where homeowners now park their cars and leave wheelie bins out for collection , it is said the @entity31 once gathered at the great castle			1
the claims have been made by @entity34 , who carried out extensive geographical research in preparation for a book			2
he says ancient @entity38 built their major towns and settlements along straight lines calculated by the rising and the setting of the sun. historian @entity34 believes @entity20 's , illustration pictured , @entity19 was built at the end of @entity1 , @entity16 in @entity17 all royal courts had to have good road links and mr @entity34 theorises the present location of @entity1 was a very ‘ significant ’ spot			1
in his work , @entity50 : discovering the @entity52 of @entity53 , he suggests it was the meeting place of two major @entity53 pathways			1
geographical evidence of the two ancient routes made this location a prominent one in medieval @entity60 , he claims			0
if legend is to be believed , @entity20 and his court were the rulers of @entity60 in the late 5th and early 6th centuries			1
according to histories and romances , the heroic monarch led the defence of @entity60 against wave after wave of @entity72 invaders			0
the locality is not completely new to @entity20 links			2
the nearby beauty spot of @entity76 , the largest freshwater lake in @entity77 , has long been claimed to be the water in which the famous @entity20 sword , @entity80 , was thrown by @entity81			1
a @entity19 theme park was opened a few miles away in 1983 aiming to make the most of the legend but it closed in 2012			2
mr @entity34 , who won the @entity85 in 1997 , says his geographical research makes it ‘ more plausible than ever ’ that the small corner of @entity17 could be the location of the mythical @entity19			1
his claims have been taken up by a local campaign group which is trying to stop a link road being built in the area			2
the council wants to construct a highway across a patch of woodland at the end of @entity1			2
this aerial view shows @entity99 in @entity16 on the left , the @entity1 cul - de - sac in the centre , leading to a stretch of woodland on the right where @entity34 believes @entity19 was built @entity34 claims the precise location of @entity19 was at the end of @entity1 , in the village of @entity16 , marked right			1
the cul - de - sac is near @entity76 , marked left , the lake in which local legend claims the sword @entity80 was thrown @entity34 added that the crossing pathways , pictured , on what is now the @entity4 ' have an astonishing power to illuminate the long - buried past by revealing the location of the legendary court of @entity20			1
' the intersection lies at the end of a cul - de - sac off @entity99 where a tracks leads to woodland , pictured a spokesman for @entity123 said the revelations mean the area should be preserved and the planned highway scrapped			0
‘ we have lots of issues with this link road , including it going past school playing fields which could harm the health of pupils and destroying wildlife habitats , ’ he said			0
‘ but we did n’t think for one minute that the route would also run through what could be @entity19			0
’ he added : ‘ this site needs a lot more investigation			0
we just need a white knight to come along and help us save it from development			0
‘ we stumbled on this new theory while researching our campaign but it does tie in with local legends about @entity20			2
‘ @entity149 should be embracing its links with the distant past and not ripping it up			0
’ arthurian legend claims @entity20 was the son and heir of @entity155 , and was born on @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158			1
the remains of @entity160 is pictured a lake on the woodland where @entity20 's @entity19 was thought to have been built			1
@entity20 was a legendary @entity60 leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries who according to histories and romances , led the defence of @entity60 against invaders in the early 6th century @entity168 , 69 , who has lived in the cul - de - sac for more than 40 years , said : ‘ i just started laughing when i heard about it			2
‘ i thought someone was having a joke for @entity173 but then i realised it ’s still march			0
’ the details of @entity20 ’s story are shrouded in folklore and his existence is disputed by modern historians			1
but mr @entity34 said that even if @entity19 was a myth , it is likely the site was of ‘ religious or cultural significance to the @entity53 people and later @entity187 visitors ’			1
‘ the @entity188 from @entity189 to the @entity190 is strongly linked to @entity20 ’s legend , ’ he added			1
the first mention of the @entity193 was in 1155			0
this book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to @entity20 from @entity198 's father , @entity197 and is now believed to be hung in the @entity199 in @entity200 , pictured @entity20 was a legendary @entity60 leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries who according to histories and romances , led the defence of @entity60 against invaders in the early 6th century			1
however , the @entity20 that many people are familiar with today – thanks to tv shows , films and stage productions – is said to be a combination of many different myths and legends that have developed over the last 1,000 years			0
arthurian legend claims @entity20 was the son and heir of @entity155 , and was believed to have born on @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158			1
a sorcerer called @entity218 is said to have taken a sword called @entity80 from the so - called @entity220 for @entity155 , but upon the @entity20 ’s death , he placed the sword in a stone			1
@entity218 stated that ‘ he who draws the sword from the stone , he shall be king			0
’ after the @entity20 's death , @entity20 is said to have pulled @entity218 ’s @entity80 sword from this stone , proving his right to the throne			1
the legend does n’t specify exactly where this lake was and there is a debate on whether it was @entity76 in @entity235 , the @entity236 at @entity237 , or @entity238 on the edge of @entity240			1
the latter is closest to the supposed birthplace in @entity243			0
legend continues that during his reign , in the kingdom of @entity19 , @entity20 met with his knights at a @entity193 , journeyed after the @entity248 and fought a number of battles using the infamous sword			1
during the @entity252 , in approximately 537 , @entity20 was killed and his body was sent to the @entity254			0
historians believe this area was @entity257 and the @entity259 levels			0
later , legend expanded the story and claimed upon @entity20 's death , the sword was returned to the @entity220			2
early written accounts of the @entity20 story appeared in 1130 in @entity267 's @entity266 where he claimed @entity218 had the 15 - year - old @entity20 crowned at nearby @entity269 , in @entity270			0
the first mention of the @entity193 , however , was in @entity273 's @entity272 in 1155			0
this book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to @entity20 from @entity198 's father , @entity197 and is now believed to be hung in the @entity199 in @entity200 ( pictured above )			2
@entity20 was said to have sat his knights on the round table so that none was ever in a position of power of importance			0
the author did add his assertions were not to be taken literally			0
' i used an example of these connecting @entity53 pathways in what is now that area and how years later a @entity19 theme park popped up nearby			1
'' if you happen to look on a modern map and see the word ' @entity19 ' , as in the theme park , it might look like this is where @entity19 may have been			0
' sadly this type of thing , which i meant as a joke , can be misinterpreted by people who want to believe what they want to believe			0

historian dr @entity34 believes @entity20 ’s @entity19 was in @entity17
he *pinpoints* the exact location at the end of @entity1 in @entity16
the area is said to have been the meeting place of two @entity53 pathways
it ’s also close to @entity76 , a lake where @entity80 was believed to have been thrown upon @entity20 ’s death
for centuries , @entity19 was believed to have been in @entity157 , @entity243
as a result , the location of the famous lake was believed to have been @entity238 on the edge of @entity240
dr @entity34 has laughed off the local *reaction* however because he believes @entity19 is based on a myth and never really existed
