by @entity0 published : 02:14 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 09:13 est , 5 april 2013 @entity2 's biggest union is plotting to cripple the country with the first general strike for nearly 90 years			1
in a move that it privately admits is ‘ explicitly political ’ , @entity5 will meet other unions later this month to discuss a co-ordinated nationwide industrial walkout			2
leaked papers from the union , which has 1.5million members , describe a general strike as a ‘ desirable ’ protest at the government ’s austerity drive , including the recent changes to benefits			1
strike ! unions have proposed plans for a general walkout by workers from across the country ( file photo ) previous protest : public sector workers attend a rally in @entity28 , @entity29 , in november 2011 , as workers around the country staged the biggest general strike for decades in a row over pensions last night fellow union , @entity36 , which has 1.3million members , said it would back proposals for a general strike as long as it was the end , not the beginning , of a protest campaign			1
the leaking of @entity5 ’s explosive plans comes as its members are voting to elect a new leader			0
current general secretary @entity47 – nicknamed ‘ @entity48 ’ – is opposed in the ballot by one other candidate , @entity50 , who is backed by the @entity51			2
a result is expected on april 15 , and a meeting about a general strike is due at the @entity56 hq nine days later			1
historic : the last general strike came in 1926 following a dispute over coal miners ' pay travel chaos : an archive photograph taken during the @entity64 of may 1926 shows city workers crossing @entity66 after walking from their homes owing to the suspension of public transport services the @entity70 are calling on @entity72 leader @entity71 , whose biggest backer is unite , to stop taking cash from the union until it withdraws the strike threat			1
' @entity72 's single biggest union paymaster is threatening @entity2 businesses and hard - working people with mass strikes ' conservative chairman @entity81 @entity70 chairman @entity81 said : ‘ @entity72 ’s single biggest union paymaster is threatening @entity2 businesses and hardworking people with mass strikes			0
‘ @entity71 must refuse to take a single penny more of his union paymaster ’s cash until @entity47 withdraws @entity5 ’s threat to sabotage our economy			2
’ since mr @entity47 became leader in september 2010 , @entity5 has donated £ 8.4million to the @entity72 , according to the @entity91			0
dilemma : @entity71 faces calls to reject further funding from @entity5 , led by hardliner @entity47 , right previous strike : an archive photo from february 1979 of the rising mound of rubbish in @entity99 , central @entity66 , during what became known as the @entity101 the threat of co-ordinated industrial action comes after unions voted overwhelmingly last september to start planning the ‘ practicalities ’ of the first general strike since 1926			1
@entity2 's previous general strike came in may 1926 following a dispute over reduced wages for coal miners			1
after the miners ( right ) were locked out from work , the @entity56 called on its 1.7million members to walk out of their jobs in solidarity			0
last - minute negotiations with prime minister @entity118 's government were called off after the @entity120 's printers refused to print an editorial criticising the proposed strike as a ' revolutionary move '			0
the workers participating in the general strike included railway workers , dockers and steelworkers			1
thousands of volunteers and special constables tried to replace the lost labour , and after nine days the @entity56 admitted defeat and called off the action			0
then from 1978 to 1979 , the @entity101 saw a public sector strike under @entity136 's government , which resulted in power cuts and piles of rubbish on streets			2
the strikes , which called for bigger pay rises , had even seen gravediggers join picket lines and leave dead bodies waiting to be buried			0
if it goes ahead , a general strike would wipe out vital services , with workers from teachers to prison guards , firemen to nurses , dinner ladies to paramedics likely to walk out			1
but such a move is strongly opposed by more moderate unions , who fear it would be impossible to organise and would fuel resentment among the public due to the chaos it would cause			0
yesterday @entity162 , general secretary of @entity163 , which represents professionals such as engineers and scientists , said : ‘ whilst an understandable reaction to austerity and failing @entity170 policies , talk of a general strike is a dangerous distraction , allowing the government to shift attention from its own problems			1
’ at last year ’s @entity56 , @entity177 , general secretary of @entity178 , the airline pilots ’ union , warned : ‘ it wo n’t work			2
worse , it will give our opponents a stick to beat us with			0
’ a @entity36 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ a general strike ? in principle , yes , we would support that provided there was a legitimate trade dispute and it was legal			1
‘ we believe that a general strike can only be the culmination of a campaign , not the beginning of a campaign			2
’ the @entity178 , whose members are taking strike action today , is also keen to co-ordinate industrial action for maximum effect			0
‘ if we as a union movement are serious about opposing what the government is doing , then clearly the best weapon at our disposal is industrial action , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ the best way to deploy that weapon is co-ordinated action			0

unite plan to call ' political ' general strike is backed in principle by @entity36
