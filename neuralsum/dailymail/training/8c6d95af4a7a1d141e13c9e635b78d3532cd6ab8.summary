overweight people are less likely to file for divorce than their more slender peers , according to a study			0
couples whose individual weights sit between 101 and 200lbs - considered ' physically fit ' - are three times more likely to end their marriage than those of any other size , according to online separation service @entity18			1
couples who are considered physically fit are the most likely to divorce , while those who are overweight tend to stay together more the site found that out of 2,708 cases , 2,054 involved individuals in that weight bracket : almost 76 per cent			1
people weighing between 201 and 250lbs accounted for 493 of the cases ( 18.21 per cent ) , and only 143 divorce cases involved people weighing over 250lb ( just over five per cent )			1
the results seem to intimate that happy people eat more - evidence backed up by further recent research which found that 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship			1
some 62 per cent of people admit gaining up to a stone since being in a relationship , while 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight			1
part of this seems to be to do with mirroring your beloved 's eating habits - 52 per cent of women say they often eat the same amount as their male partner , and 56 per cent admit this means they eat much larger portions than they would normally - but another reason seems to be a drop in physical activity			0
upon entering into a happy relationship , 30 per cent of couples say their main activity together becomes staying in and watching television , while 20 per cent state eating out together as a key bonding pastime			2
more than 60 per cent of people put on weight when they are in a comfortable relationship and 72 per cent also think their partner has put on weight since the start of their relationship the research , commissioned by @entity68 , also revealed that 66 per cent of couples think they have put on weight together			2
this makes being in a relationship the most common cause of weight gain , beating comfort eating , lack of exercise , and holidays			0
@entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 at @entity68 said : ‘ this survey has revealed some very interesting results , and it ’s surprising to see how complacent people can be when they are in a relationship			0
‘ it ’s widely known that people tend to put on a little bit of weight once they have found love , but what we did n't expect to find was that the weight gain is on average a stone , if not more .			0
