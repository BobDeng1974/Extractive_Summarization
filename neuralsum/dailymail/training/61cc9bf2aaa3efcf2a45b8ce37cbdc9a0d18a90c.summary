by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:34 am on 10th february 2012 nearly a third of terror suspects released or transferred from @entity4 after being classified as an acceptable threat went on to re-engage in insurgent activities , a secret report has revealed			1
the @entity8 and @entity9 administrations moved 600 detainees out of the top - security prison in @entity12 because of domestic political pressure - only for 27 per cent to reoffend			1
the report , by @entity15 on a @entity17 armed services subcommittee , provides the @entity15 perspective on an issue that has divided @entity20 since the start of the @entity23 war and the use of the @entity26 prison for those captured			2
persistent challenge : nearly a third of the 600 terror suspects released or transferred from @entity4 ( above ) having been deemed an acceptable risk went on to re-offend ( file picture ) failures : former @entity35 president @entity8 ( left ) and his successor @entity9 ( right ) sought to reduce the prison population in the face of domestic political pressure and a desire to earn goodwill abroad , the report revealed and it split the @entity42 and @entity43 last year over how to write rules on handling detainees			1
the report , a copy of which was obtained by @entity49 , comes as the @entity9 administration officials have acknowledged that they are considering whether to release several @entity23 @entity52 prisoners from @entity4 and send them to a third country as an incentive to bring the @entity52 to peace talks			1
the step is certain to create an uproar in @entity43 , especially among @entity15			2
the 93 - page study is likely to be part of the @entity15 effort to influence the ongoing debate			2
in a rare break on a committee that typically is bipartisan on defense issues , @entity62 dissented from the report despite efforts to reconcile their differences			0
bargaining tool : the report comes as @entity9 administration officials admit they are considering whether to release several @entity23 @entity52 prisoners from @entity4 as part of peace talk negotiations the report from the armed services investigations panel cites testimony before the committee last year that 27 per cent of former detainees ' were confirmed or suspected to have been re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities , ' up from 25 per cent the previous year			1
intelligence officials had indicated that the number would increase			0
' the @entity8 and @entity9 administrations , reacting to domestic political pressures and a desire to earn goodwill abroad , sought to reduce the @entity4 population by sending detainees elsewhere , ' the report said			1
' both administrations faced the persistent challenge of ensuring that the potential threat posed by each detainee had been aptly assessed before transfer or release , and that the countries that received the detainees had the capacity and willingness to handle them in a way that sufficiently recognized the dangers involved			0
' despite earnest and well - meaning efforts by officials in both administrations , the re-engagement rate suggests failures in one or both aspects of the process , ' the report concluded			0
the report recommended that the @entity112 , @entity113 and other intelligence agencies report to @entity43 on the factors that contribute to a former detainee re-engaging in terrorist activities			0
the committee also is seeking reports on the effectiveness of agreements with other countries			0
as of january 1 , 779 individuals have been held at @entity4 , 600 have left the installation , eight died there and 171 remain , the report said , citing the @entity112			2
the report noted that former defense secretary @entity127 held the view that the military should not be a jailer and there was a plan to get detainees out			0
president @entity9 also had vowed to close @entity4 , though he has met strong resistance in @entity43			1
lawmakers repeatedly have added provisions to various bills blocking the government from transferring detainees from @entity4 to the @entity35 , or barring the construction of facilities domestically to house terror suspects			1
rep. @entity142 , the ranking @entity143 on the committee , said the report failed to take into account ' the national security gains of shutting down the facility at @entity4			0
that is a goal that the @entity8 administration sought to achieve , and it is rightly a goal of the @entity9 administration			1
i continue to believe that the detention facility at @entity4 , @entity12 , is a black eye for our nation abroad , serving as a powerful recruiting tool for terrorists			0
' we have the ability to close the facility , and we should be working towards that end			0

@entity8 and @entity9 moved 600 terror suspects amid political pressure
