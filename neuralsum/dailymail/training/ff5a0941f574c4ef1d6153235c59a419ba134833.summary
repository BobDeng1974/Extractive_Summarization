by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 25 october 2013 the eerie ghost - like shape of the ‘ coldest place in the universe ’ has been revealed by astronomers			1
with a crisp temperature of -272 ° c , the @entity7 it is even colder than the -270 ° c background glow from the @entity10			1
earlier observations of the nebula showed it to be lopsided , which is how it got its name			1
the @entity16 later revealed a bow - tie - like structure			1
the @entity7 has revealed its true shape			2
the background blue structure , as seen in visible light with the @entity16 , shows a double - lobe shape with a narrow central region			1
@entity24 's resolution reveals the nebula 's more elongated shape , as seen in red the new image , taken using the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) telescope in @entity30 , reveals how @entity16 may have been wrong			1
according to @entity24 astronomers , and the twin lobes seen in @entity16 image may in fact be a trick of the light			1
the finding could help scientists better understand how a star such as our sun will behave in its final death throes			0
‘ what seemed like a double lobe , or “ boomerang ” shape , from @entity50 - based optical telescopes , is actually a much broader structure that is expanding rapidly into space , ’ said @entity51 , a researcher and principal scientist at @entity54 ’s @entity53 in @entity55 , @entity56			2
the @entity16 caught the @entity7 in these early images			1
according to @entity24 astronomers , the twin lobes seen in this @entity16 image may in fact be a trick of the light the @entity7 is located about 5,000 light - years away in the constellation @entity64			1
it is a relatively young example of an object known as a planetary nebula , which , contrary to their name , are the end - of - life phases of stars like our sun. what remains at their centres are white dwarf stars , which emit intense ultraviolet radiation that causes the gas in the nebulae to glow with brilliant colours			2
the @entity82 is a pre-planetary nebula , representing the stage in a star 's life immediately preceding the planetary nebula phase			0
over the last 1,500 years , nearly one and a half times the mass of our @entity89 has been lost by the central star of the @entity7 in an ejection process known as a bipolar outflow			0
at this stage , the nebula is seen by starlight reflecting off its dust grains			0
the new image was taken using the @entity24 ( pictured ) in @entity30			0
@entity24 is an international partnership between @entity97 , the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and the @entity30 the @entity7 is a young planetary nebula and the coldest object found in the @entity103 so far			1
with a crisp temperature of -272 ° c , the @entity7 it is even colder than the -270 ° c background glow from the @entity10			1
@entity107 and @entity108 called it the @entity7 in 1980 after observing it with a large ground - based telescope in @entity112			2
the -272 ° c temperature was calculated by seeing how it absorbed the cosmic microwave background radiation the @entity82 is a pre-planetary nebula , representing the stage in a star 's life immediately preceding the planetary nebula phase			1
over the last 1,500 years , nearly one and a half times the mass of our @entity89 has been lost by the central star of the @entity7			0
the outflow of gas from this particular star is expanding rapidly and cooling itself in the process			0
the -272 ° c temperature was calculated by seeing how it absorbed the cosmic microwave background radiation			1
‘ when astronomers looked at this object in 2003 with @entity16 , they saw a very classic “ hourglass ” shape , ’ said dr @entity51			2
‘ many planetary nebulae have this same double - lobe appearance , which is the result of streams of high - speed gas being jettisoned from the star			0
‘ the jets then excavate holes in a surrounding cloud of gas that was ejected by the star even earlier in its lifetime as a red giant			0
’ @entity24 's unprecedented resolution revealed a more elongated cloud of cold gas that is roughly round			0
the researchers also discovered a dense lane of millimetre - sized dust grains surrounding the star , which explains why this outer cloud has an hourglass shape in visible light			2
@entity16 took this image in 1998			0
it shows faint arcs and ghostly filaments embedded within the diffuse gas of the nebula 's smooth ' bow tie ' lobes			1
the image was exposed for 1000 seconds through a green - yellow filter			0
the light in the image comes from starlight from the central star reflected by dust particles the dust grains have created a mask that shades a portion of the central star and allows its light to leak out only in narrow but opposite directions into the cloud , giving it an hourglass appearance			0
the new research also indicated that the outer fringes of the nebula are beginning to warm , even though they are still slightly colder than the cosmic microwave background			2
this warming may be due to the photoelectric effect - an effect first proposed by @entity189 in which light is absorbed by solid material , which then re-emits electrons			0
‘ this is important for the understanding of how stars die and become planetary nebulae , ’ said dr @entity51			0
‘ using @entity24 , we were quite literally and figuratively able to shed new light on the death throes of a sun - like star			2

eerie glow of the @entity7 was shown by the @entity24 telescope
nebula is -272 ° c - even colder than background glow from the @entity10
earlier observations by @entity16 suggested it had a lopsided ' bow tie ' shape
astronomers now believe the twin lobes may have been a trick of the light
