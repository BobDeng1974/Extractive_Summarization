by @entity0 for the first time , @entity11 public schools are projected this fall to have more minority students than non-hispanic whites , a shift largely fueled by growth in the number of @entity5 children partially due to workers migrating from @entity7 and other countries to work on mushroom farms			1
the changing demographics of @entity11 education are apparent inside @entity18 's summer school classroom , where giggling grade - schoolers mostly come from homes where @entity21 is the primary language			2

but it also brings up some complex societal questions that often fall to school systems to address , including issues of immigration , poverty , diversity and inequity			1

other families , he said , seek out the district 's diverse schools ' because they realize it 's not a homogenous world out there			0

the new majority - minority status of @entity11 's schools mirrors a change that is coming for the nation as a whole			1
the @entity142 estimates that the country 's population also will have more minorities than whites for the first time in 2043 , a result of higher birth rates among @entity150 and a stagnating or declining birth rate among blacks , whites and @entity155			0
moving towards success : recent high school graduate @entity157 as he speaks during an interview with the @entity0 at @entity98 in class : teacher @entity18 working with young students on their storytelling skills during summer school at @entity98 even as the population becomes more diverse , schools are becoming more racially divided , reflecting @entity11 housing patterns			1

roughly one - quarter of @entity150 and african - americans live below the poverty line — meaning a family of four has nearly 24,000 in annual income — and some of the poorest of @entity5 children are dealing with the instability of being in the country illegally or with a parent who is , @entity181 said			0
focusing on teacher preparation and stronger curriculum is ' not going to get us anywhere unless we pay attention to the really basic needs of these children , things like nutrition and health and safety , and the instability of the homes , ' she said			0
this transformation in school goes beyond just educating the children			0
