by @entity0 and @entity1 the state does not know best how people spend their own money , @entity2 insisted today as he set out details of an overhaul of pensions			1
people heading into retirement will be able to get their hands on their entire pension pot , instead of having to convert it into a scheme which pays out small amounts each month for the rest of their lives			1
the chancellor insisted it was ' about trusting people ' , and did not mean people would rush out to blow their money on a @entity22			1
radical changes to pension schemes are unveiled today , allowing people to take out their money when they reach the age of 55 and spend it as they wish			1
the shake - up , which was a centrepiece of the @entity27 in march , means 18 million pensioners will be able to vary their retirement incomes under personalised annuities			1
from next april , no one will have to buy an annuity , a product from insurance companies which gives pensioners a guaranteed annual income for life			2
instead they will be able to withdraw a lump sum			0
the scheme was first mooted in the @entity41 , when @entity43 minister @entity42 controversially said people should be free to blow their pensions on buying a @entity22 if they wanted to			1
mr @entity2 told @entity46 's today programme : ' it ’s all about saying to people " look , you have saved through your lives , you have worked hard for these savings , you should have freedom over how you access them and i want to make sure you 're in possession of all the best information before you make those choices '			1
millions of people will get free , impartial advice on how to make the most of their retirement savings			1
the guidance will be delivered by a range of independent organisations , including the @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) and follows concerns consumers would not trust information given by organisations with a vested interest in selling a financial product or service			0
mr @entity2 added : ' we ’re talking about trusting people here			1
it ’s not my money , it ’s your money , this is the money of people who have worked hard and saved hard			0
' of course , i want to make sure that they have the right information available to them			0
' but we have to get away from this patronising view that the state knows best how people should spend their own money and that 's what this fundamental reform of pensions is all about			0
' last night , pension experts cautiously welcomed the changes , because annuity products have offered poor value in recent years			2
but they stressed that everyone should be offered free financial advice to fully understand the implications			0
ministers said such advice would be funded by a levy on the financial sector and would be impartial – not from the pension provider			2
in the small print of the consultation released yesterday , the @entity102 said it will be offered ‘ through a broad range of channels , including web - based , phone - based as well as face - to - face ’			0
currently those who retire can take a lump sum of 25 per cent out of their pot tax - free			0
under the new system , they will still face paying tax if they take it all out at once			2
but under changes being planned in the @entity102 , deals will be available allowing cash sums to be taken out later in life to meet sudden needs , such as social care			0
it is thought the shake - up will allow 18million pensioners to vary their retirement incomes			1
file photo the chancellor said : ‘ we ’re making sure that people have the right support to make their own choice about how best to finance their retirement			1
’ advice will be offered by special advice services , not companies which sell financial products , and be regulated by the @entity138			0
pensions expert @entity139 said the pension changes would ‘ give consumers more choice and more control			0
’ she added : ‘ for the first time pension savers will be free to choose what to do with their retirement funds			2
the decision that guidance must be impartial and separate from the industry is a real game changer			0
