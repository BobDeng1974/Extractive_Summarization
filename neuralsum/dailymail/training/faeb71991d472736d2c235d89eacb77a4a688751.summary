by @entity1 reporter last updated at 7:51 pm on 7th october 2011 sir @entity2 , the ultimate political heavyweight , is not the first person you would associate with the modern obsession of exercise and keeping fit			1
yet the massive 29 - stone former @entity8 , who needed eight yards of material for his suits , will be remembered in his home town of @entity13 after councillors decided to dedicate a sports centre in his honour			1
the politician 's name will live on in the @entity20 area when the ' the sir @entity21 ' opens its doors next year			0
big idea : sir @entity2 has had a sports centre named after him in his home town of @entity13 a one - time fiery contender for the leadership of the party he died aged 82 in september last year			1
the renaming of the town 's sports centre after the former mayor , who had a 75 - inch waistline , came about after town hall chiefs asked for suggestions for the name of their revamped sports centre			0
@entity13 councillor @entity39 , sir @entity2 's godson , was responsible for the dedication idea			1
but it has sparked anger in the town with opponents declaring it ' daft ' to name a sports facility after such an overweight public figure			1
sir @entity2 was known for his larger - than - life personality forged out of a difficult upbringing as an illegitimate child , when such things still mattered			2
he is believed to be @entity55 's heaviest mp , peaking at 29 stone and 12 pounds ( about 190 kilograms )			0
his nickname , ' @entity58 ' , was also the title of his autobiography			0
a common joke on the size of the @entity63 in the early 1970s was that only one taxi would be needed to transport the entire party ; after @entity2 's election , the party could fill two taxis			2
after a lifetime of public service , which included a spell as mayor of @entity13 with his mother as @entity74 , he died in his sleep in a nursing home weighing just ten stone following a battle with cancer			2
meanwhile councillor @entity39 has defended the naming decision and said : ' apart from the plaque that we intend to unveil outside the town hall next month , which really is no more than a small civic commemoration , the town wo n't have a totemic , significant memorial in lasting tribute to @entity2 's work			2
' after all , @entity90 has a theatre			0
' clearly , a lot of @entity2 's work over his time was around education , and clearly the new leisure centre will have a schools dimension because it will be used during the day by our local education establishments			2
' this is about a lasting memorial , irrespective of the facility , and @entity2 would have promoted the community and social aspects of this building			0
' @entity105 mp for @entity13 @entity106 added : ' it just goes to show how out of touch @entity108 have become			1
even @entity2 would have thought this was a daft idea			1
' the centre , which will open next year , will have an eight - lane 25 - metre swimming pool , a learner pool with a moveable floor , a sports hall , thermal and fitness suites , dance studios and a youth gym			0
sir @entity2 , a bachelor who once said he was ' married to politics ' , served as @entity13 's mp from 1972 until his retirement in 1992			1
he won the seat by securing a huge swing away from @entity105 - becoming only the seventh @entity124 mp in parliament at the time			0
sir @entity2 , who was knighted in 1988 , remained active within the @entity8 until only a few months before his death .			0

@entity132 came up with the idea to dedicate gym to former @entity13 mp
opponents claim ' even @entity2 would have thought this was a daft idea '
