by @entity0 @entity1 , a @entity2 cattle rancher , has become something of a celebrity in his frontier stronghold since his showdown over land with federal authorities earlier this month			1
officials had tried to round up @entity1 's cattle and evict him on april 12 after 20 years of not paying taxes			1
however they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people , some of them armed with sniper rifles , turned up and threatened to open fire			0

they did n’t have nothing for their kids to do			0
they did n’t have nothing for their young girls to do			0
