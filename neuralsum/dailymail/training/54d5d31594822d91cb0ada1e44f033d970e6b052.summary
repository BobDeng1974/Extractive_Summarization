by @entity0 published : 07:16 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 20:50 est , 15 january 2014 the last portrait that @entity3 posed for is thought to have been identified in a stately home where it has been hanging for more than 300 years			1
the oil painting , which was created on an oak panel , has been hanging in a stately home in @entity9 for more than 300 years with little clue as to its origins			1
however , the value of the portrait jumped from a mere £ 10,000 to more than £ 1 million after experts examining tree rings in the panel discovered they could be dated to before the king died in 1547			1
the painting is on a wooden panel , which has now been scientifically dated to within @entity3 's lifetime , possibly making it the last painting he ever posed for @entity22 carrying out a painstaking tree - ring dating study of the oak panels the discover the age of the portrait the painting was previously thought to be a portrait of the king painted after his death			1
now , after thorough scientific examination of the oak , experts believe @entity3 may have posed for an unknown artist in 1544 , three years before his death			1
the wood is believed to date back to 1529			2
the painting has an inscription on it stating that it was painted when the @entity40 was aged 54 , in the 36th year of his reign , but it was common for information to be placed on later copies			1
but a closer look at the inscription showed it had been added at the same time the portrait was created			2
it will now be moved to a glass case in a different area of @entity50 in @entity9 where it had been display to visitors for much of the year			1
the procedure to date the wood involves incredibly precise measurements and can reveal the date that a tree was felled the thick wooden panel had to be closely examined with microscopes and other expert devices to determine its age , without damaging it part of the scientific study that helped to date the portrait to within the @entity40 's lifetime dr @entity67 , the collections curator at @entity50 , said : ' we recently had to revise our collections for our insurance and the valuers alerted us to the implications if the @entity3 portrait was an earlier piece than thought			1
' the feeling has always been that our portrait was painted after his lifetime and was a very good copy			0
it was common to have the year of his age on later copies			0
' an expert came in and he carefully took the painting out of the frame and studied three of the four oak panels			2
' he counted the distance in the gap between the annual growth rings to a 100th of a millimetre and found the three boards were all from the same oak tree in the eastern @entity95 , probably @entity96			0
“ the tree was felled sometime in or shortly after 1529			0
it would n’t have been transported to @entity98 immediately			0
it would have been left lying around for a period			0
the king was known for his six marriages , all of which ended in some sort of tragedy , divorce , or death , but @entity3 was also known for other , stranger things : ' the study represents a date after which the portrait was painted but it does allow for the key conclusion that it remains possible that the work is of the same date in the inscription			2
@entity116 , an author and historian of the @entity119 monarchy , said : ' he died in january 1547 and suffered from ill - health for much of 1546			0
there are n’t any paintings of him depicted as as old man			0
' it may well be the last painting that he posed for			1
' the work was previously owned by @entity3 's brother - in - law sir @entity129 , husband of @entity130 , who was the sister of his sixth and last wife @entity132			0
after @entity3 ’s death in 1547 , sir @entity129 was made the @entity135 at @entity136 in @entity9			1
archives show an incumbent at @entity50 purchased the painting from the @entity135 in 1680 where it has remained in obscurity until now			1
@entity141 , a leading art dealer and specialist on @entity143 said only 10 portraits of @entity3 were painted in his lifetime			0
he said : ' portraits of him from life are very rare			0
the majority of @entity3 ’s iconography was produced posthumously and in considerable quantity for dynastic reasons			0
' if it can be proven for definite that @entity3 sat for the @entity50 portrait then it would be very significant			2
' a late 16th century copy could be worth anything between 1,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds whereas a work painted from life would be more than one million pounds depending on quality and condition			2
' @entity50 in @entity9 where the painting was displayed for a number of years before experts discovered it was priceless			1

painting hung in obscurity in @entity50 , @entity9 , for over 300 years
*modern* scientific *techniques* revealed it is worth more than £ 1 million
the painting may be the last posed painting of the @entity40 before his death
