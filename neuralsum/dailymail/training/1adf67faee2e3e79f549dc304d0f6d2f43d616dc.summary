by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 1 february 2013 when applying for a job under a fake identity , it is important to make sure that , at the very least , you have a water - tight cover story			2
so when dead terrorist ' @entity7 ' answered an advert for a teaching post at an @entity11 primary school last year , citing @entity12 as his father , it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade			2
he was one of hundreds of bizarre false names given by chancers apparently hoping to secure jobs in schools in @entity20 , in northern @entity11			1
perhaps the so - called ' @entity21 ' thought he would stand a better chance of teaching children @entity23 when he told @entity11 's @entity25 that his father 's name was @entity28			1
most candidates will not make it through to even the final stages of selection for primary school vacancies or maybe bow - wielding @entity36 deity @entity34 thought he needed a break from heavenly duties to help boost the state 's religious education results			1
there was even one aspirant who gave his name as @entity44 , which translates as ' fake '			0
his father 's name was given as @entity47			0
and unsurprisingly , all these applicants had spotless academic records to boot , with 100 per cent marks in all exams			1
when dead terrorist ' @entity7 ' , left , applied for a teaching post at an @entity11 primary school last year , citing @entity12 , right , as his father , it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade but rather than dismiss the applications out of hand , the state 's basic education department allotted them all registration numbers and and even issued letters for counselling on their ' fake ' addresses			1
such aspirants , shortlisted in the first list of candidates for the primary teachers ' job , have made the state 's basic education department 's recruitment drive a laughing stock			1
the candidates have clearly fudged every detail , from name and address to their exam records			0
incredibly , the screening of the applications , filled online , found over 60 per cent of candidates to be fake			2
for 72,825 vacant posts of primary teachers , more than 70 lakh applications were received of which only about 20 are believed to be genuine			0
minister of state for basic education @entity88 said the department would sort out the errors			1
' this system of receiving online applications and sorting it out by software was meant for observing complete transparency			0
' maybe there are some problems but they will be sorted out in coming days , ' he was quoted as saying			0
interestingly , many of the candidates have claimed to have consistently secured more than 95 per cent marks in all exams			1
a senior employee of the department said : ' the problem is that only fake candidates can be called for first and second counselling because their total marks are shown as between 95 per cent and 100 per cent			1
' obviously such candidates will not turn up			0
but who will be answerable for the money and resources spent on shortlisting the applicants ? ' it would have been better if the department had made it mandatory for the applicants to enclose all their educational certificates			2
' however , @entity119 , secretary of the basic education board , said : ' we are still in the process of making a final merit list			0
' the fake names would obviously be deleted during the final counselling of the aspirants			1
in that case , the next genuine candidate in the merit list will be given the opportunity			0
' since the vacancy for primary teachers was announced district - wise , lakhs of candidates from over 20 districts applied with the hope of being selected for the job			0
the application was invited online and the cut off list of each district was supposed to vary according to the marks obtained by the applicants there			2
but , the software could n't detect and cancel many forms with fake details			0
also , it could not discard more than one form filled by the same applicant			0
as a result of it , the same applicants have been allotted many registrations numbers .			1

he is one of hundreds of false names given by applicants in @entity20
also *include* @entity21 , whose father if @entity28 , and @entity36 god @entity34
all had spotless academic records , with 100 per cent marks in all exams
but the state education department allotted them all registration numbers
it even issued letters for counselling on their ' fake ' addresses
