once in a while , a colossal chunk of ice breaks free from @entity4 's majestic landscape and drifts out into the ocean			2
in march , @entity6 was able to capture this remarkable event from space during a process that was months in the making			0
the monster iceberg , larger than @entity12 , was spotted breaking away from @entity4 's @entity13 by the @entity14 ( @entity15 )			1
the image on the left shows the landscape before the iceberg broke three and on the right the monster berg floating in the ocean glaciers in the @entity26 of west @entity4 are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels			1
measuring 17 miles ( 27km ) long , iceberg @entity33 appears to have fractured and moved out into in the @entity26 sometime in mid- to late - february 2015 , @entity6 said			1
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) on @entity6 's @entity37 and @entity38 satellites took images spanning the calving event			2
@entity33 is the 34th iceberg from the ' b ' quadrant of @entity4 to be tracked by the @entity15			0
the new berg is still smaller , however , than the much older @entity44 - a fragment of @entity46 that initially broke off from the @entity47 in march 2000			2
the first image ( left ) shows the iceberg on february 16 , when it was still attached to the ice shelf			1
by february 28 ( middle ) , it appears to have separated somewhat			2
by march 5 ( right ) , it is floating freely @entity33 is the 34th iceberg from the ' b ' quadrant of @entity4 to be tracked by the @entity15			0
glaciers in this region are losing ice faster than anywhere else on the continent and are the largest contributors to the rise of sea levels large icebergs can have large - scale impacts on the @entity64			1
for example , as the bergs melt , the addition of cold , fresh water to the saltwater ocean can affect ocean currents and circulation			0
researchers have shown , however , that even more fresh water comes from the melting of smaller and much more numerous bergs			2
the @entity26 has long been thought to be the weakest ice sheet in the @entity76			1
a study published in december suggests the barren region is haemorrhaging ice at a rate triple that of a decade ago			1
researchers believe that the melting of glaciers in @entity4 , which contain enough water to raise sea levels by at least a metre , may be irreversible			1
the findings of the 21 - year study by @entity6 and the @entity89 , @entity91 claim to provide the most accurate estimates yet of just how fast glaciers are melting in the @entity94			1
scientists found the rate by taking radar , laser and satellite measurements of the glaciers ' mass between 1992 and 2013			1
they found they lost an average 83 gigatons per year ( 91.5 billion @entity102 tons ) , or the equivalent of losing the water weight of @entity105 every two years			2
scientists are hoping to combine images such as this with noises recorded from icebergs to detect the different ways that glaciers lose ice into the oceans			1
earlier this year , the incredible sounds of an ice ' cracking ' and crashing down into water as an iceberg were recorded by researchers			0
. the scientists used underwater microphones aboard buoys to record a variety of iceberg births at the @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 during three days in august 2013			0
the recordings were then combined with time - lapse photos of the glacier during the same period			0
by synchronising the sound recordings with the photographs , the researchers discovered that different types of ice loss are associated with distinct rumbles , snaps and splashes			0
they are interested in this because the ice floating around @entity4 has thinned by nearly 20 percent , according to recent research			0
this is depleting the bulwark that prevents the permanent collapse of glaciers covering the southern continent			1
the study , based on satellite measurements between 1994 and 2012 by the @entity149 , sheds new light on how @entity76 ice responds to climate change			0
ice barriers have an average thickness of between 400 to 500 meters ( 1,300 to 1,600 feet ) and can extend hundreds of kilometers off the coast of @entity4			0
if the ice becomes too thin it would allow the permanent glaciers to slip into the ocean and start melting , sharply increasing the rise of ocean levels			1
researchers found that the total volume of @entity76 ice changed little between 1994 and 2003 , but after that point melting markedly accelerated			1
ice in western @entity4 declined throughout the study period			0
a slight increase in ice thickness was observed in eastern @entity4 before 2003 when rapid melting began , leading to an 18 percent reduction of thickness compared to 1994			2
' eighteen percent over the course of 18 years is really a substantial change , ' said @entity174 , a researcher at the @entity175			0
' overall , we show not only the total ice shelf volume is decreasing , but we see an acceleration in the last decade			0
' if the rate of thinning continues , the ice shelves could lose half of their volume over the next 200 years , the researchers calculated .			0

@entity186 fractured from @entity13 and moved into the @entity26 sometime in mid- to late - february
region is losing ice faster than anywhere on the continent and is the largest contributor to rise of sea levels
