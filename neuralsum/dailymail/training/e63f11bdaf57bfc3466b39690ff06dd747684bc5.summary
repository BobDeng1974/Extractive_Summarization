by @entity0 last updated at 9:10 am on 27th february 2012 the cost of keeping watch on @entity3 on bail comes to about £ 5million a year , it has emerged - a hundred times more than keeping him in a high - security jail			2
the @entity8 cleric is subject to a surveillance operation costing a £ 100,000 every week , as authorities monitor his every move to ensure he does not escape			1
now police are warning the phenomenal cost of keeping an eye on @entity15 is diverting money from murder investigations , and could lead to up to 12 going unsolved each year			2
surveillance regime : the cost of keeping an eye on @entity3 has spiralled to a phenomenal £ 5million a year , the cost of keeping three murder squads @entity21 , chairman of the @entity22 , told the @entity23 : ' you are talking about the cost of three murder squads and the average murder squad would probably be dealing with between eight and 12 murders a year			1
' these surveillance teams are meant to be tackling active criminals			2
' @entity15 was released on bail two weeks ago to live with his wife and children at the home in @entity35 , @entity36 , after six - and - a - half years in @entity38 prison , @entity39			2
the @entity41 cleric - whose real name is @entity43 - is facing deportation to stand trial over terror charges in his home country			2
but a judge ruled he should be released after he applied for bail and human rights judges in @entity51 ruled he could not be deported without assurances that evidence gained through torture would not be used against him			0
according to his bail conditions , @entity15 must observe a 22 - hour curfew which allows him out of his home for just two one - hour periods each day			1
he is banned from using mobile phones and is only allowed to meet people who have been security vetted and pre-approved by the home secretary			0
in order to enforce the tight security regime , dozens of police officers and intelligence agents have been drafted in for an intensive surveillance operation			1
every word spoken on @entity15 's home telephone is monitored , recorded and analysed by an officer at a police listening station			1
an interpreter is on hand to transcribe conversations held in @entity76			0
picking up a few bits : @entity15 is only allowed to leave his home for two one - hour periods each day , and when he does he is tailed by undercover police and @entity82 agents a court order allows the security services to install inside @entity3 's home ' such equipment as may be considered necessary to ensure compliance ' with his bail			1
all calls are intercepted and recorded			0
a duty translator transcribes any conversations in @entity76			0
police have kitted out @entity3 's home with cameras and microphones to capture every word spoken inside			2
the vehicle has a tracking beacon installed and a bug to monitor any conversations within			0
@entity15 's electronic ankle tag will trigger an alarm if he leaves home without consent			1
as well as marked police cars in his street , undercover officers are stationed in a nearby unmarked car to watch comings and goings from his home			1
@entity92 and @entity82 teams follow @entity15 on foot whenever he leaves his home			1
the means a network of cameras and microphones will have been installed throughout the house , monitoring and recording every word he and his family utter			0
the @entity124 has contracted @entity125 , a private security company , to monitor his curfew by means of an electronic tag			0
the tag transmits a signal to a monitoring unit installed at his house , which then relays the information back to the company 's monitoring centre			0
in the two hours he is allowed out of his home , @entity15 's movements are heavily restricted and he is confined to a marked boundary believed to be just a few miles in circumference			0
marked police cars are permanently stationed outside @entity15 's house , but when he sets foot outside he is also tailed by mobile surveillance teams based in unmarked cars and on foot			1
although most of these will be police from the @entity154 's covert surveillance teams , some are experienced intelligence specialists from @entity82 's @entity156 surveillance department			1
the revelations of the precise details of the expensive surveillance regime come just a week after it emerged it could take years to deport @entity15 back to his home country			1
@entity163 , the home secretary , is due to fly out to @entity41 to try to drum out a deal that could clear the way for him to be sent back there			0
but even if she does reach an agreement with @entity41 authorities , @entity15 could launch a fresh legal challenge in @entity172 courts and possibly @entity51			0
the legal battle could potentially last a number of years , meaning @entity15 would be allowed to stay in the @entity172 until it came to a conclusion .			0
