by @entity0 published : 04:30 est , 4 april 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 4 april 2013 justice secretary @entity1 said he had been ' appalled ' taxpayers money was being used to allow prisoners to bring ' unnecessary legal cases ' convicted criminals would be barred from claiming millions in legal aid to fund cases involving complaints about the prison system under plans announced by the government today			1
justice secretary @entity1 said he had been ' appalled ' that taxpayers money was being used to allow prisoners to bring ' unnecessary legal cases ' which could be dealt with by the prison service 's internal complaints system			1
announcing a consultation on the plans the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said they would annually save £ 4 million and cut the number of cases brought by prisoners by 11,000			0
the proposal comes days after reforms to legal aid came into effect as the government moves to reduce its £ 2.2 billion legal aid bill by £ 350 million			2
mr @entity1 said : ' i have been appalled that taxpayers pay millions of pounds every year supplying lawyers for prisoners to bring unnecessary legal cases			1
' the vast majority of these types of complaint can and should be dealt with by the prison service 's complaints system			2
' after years spiralling out of control , the amount spent on legal aid for prisoners is being tackled			2
' legal aid must be preserved for those most in need and where a lawyer 's services are genuinely needed			1
' the plan would cut access to legal aid for cases like a prisoner appealing against the category of prison they are held in , a decision to move them to a different section within a prison or taking legal action over issues like visits or correspondence , the @entity16 said			1
the proposals will be included in a consultation on changes to legal aid to be published shortly , a spokesman said			0
currently there is an internal prison requests and complaints system and on top of that an @entity69 to which appeals can be made			1
cases where prisoners are appealing against a sentence or where their actual detention is being reviewed - such as at a parole hearing - would still receive legal aid , the @entity16 said			1
@entity77 , director of campaigns at the @entity79 , said : ' the government 's proposals to further curtail legal aid for prisoners are profoundly unfair and will have negative consequences for society as a whole			1
' the misuse of solitary confinement can exacerbate mental health problems and lead to lost lives			0
prisoners can currently go to an internal prison requests and complaints system as well as an @entity69 ' access to behavioural programmes or help with resettlement can mean the difference between a prisoner going on to change their life for the better or to reoffend			1
' an internal complaints system is no replacement for external scrutiny by the courts , while the already stretched prison ombudsman does not have the power to provide meaningful redress			0
' without prisoners being able to access legal aid , which has already been restricted to prevent frivolous claims , we may see a collapse in justice in the very place where it should be paramount - within prison walls			1
' cases where prisoners are appealing against a sentence or where their actual detention is being reviewed would still receive legal aid ( file picture ) but @entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 , said : ' @entity121 ’s legal aid bill has become unsustainable and must be reformed			2
' it ’s important that prisoners , like everyone else , have access to justice , but this must not be abused			0
' taxpayers are sick to death of paying for frivolous legal actions by inmates who do it simply because someone else is paying			0
' the government is absolutely right to be cracking down on this - and not before time			0
' @entity135 , director of the @entity136 , said : ' it 's important that the justice secretary is opening a consultation rather than , as it might sound , presenting a fait accompli			0
' while no - one would support vexatious use of the law , when it comes to people deprived of their liberty and held by the state you do need safeguards to ensure that our prison system is fair , decent and open to legitimate challenge			0
' reforms to the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) came into effect this week			0
private family law , such as divorce and custody battles , personal injury cases , some employment and education law , immigration cases where the person is not detained and some debt , housing and benefit issues will all be affected			0
some law firms estimate the reforms will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent , meaning around 200,000 fewer cases , while barristers have warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced in 1949 .			2
