the proportion of women past child - bearing age with just one child is at its highest for almost 40 years , it emerged yesterday			1
the total of those bringing up so - called ‘ little emperors ’ compares with the generation of young women whose lives were disrupted by the @entity11			0
this rapid increase in the number of one - child mothers was brought about by the millions of women pursuing careers and a good salary who have neither the time nor money to have larger families , analysts said			2
women who turned 46 this year have had on average 1.92 children , compared to 2.34 children per woman in their mothers ’ generation born in the early 1940s their youngsters are sometimes referred to as ‘ little emperors ’ after the @entity32 term for the spoilt and demanding behaviour of only children			1
in a report , the @entity35 said 17 per cent of women who reached 45 last year had just one child			1
the age is regarded as the point at which a woman is not expected to have more children			0
the level was just 13 per cent in 2010			0
the last time there was a similar proportion of one - child mothers at 45 was in 1975 – those who were born in 1930 whose child - bearing years were adversely affected by the @entity11 and its aftermath			2
the proportion of families with one child has increased over time to 17 per cent , a level last seen for the 1932 cohort when women born in 1983 turned 30 last year , 46 per cent of them were childless , higher than the 42 per cent of those born in 1968 in 1975 , just over one in ten women were childless , compared with 18 per cent last year – a level that means more than a third of women today have no children or just one			1
@entity35 officials said the trend towards one - child and childless families followed social changes in the lives of most women			1
they said the rise in smaller families stemmed from more women going into higher education and careers , the increasing difficulties and delays for many in forming a partnership and getting married , and ‘ the desire to establish a career , get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting a family ’			0
the report said the reasons for not having children include the lower proportion of married women , ‘ changes in the perceived costs and benefits of child - rearing versus work and leisure activities , greater social acceptability of the child - free lifestyle ’ , and the postponement of decisions about whether to have children until it is too late			2
the rise in one - child mothers comes at a time of unprecedented success for women at work			0
official figures on the gender pay gap show women in full - time jobs earn more than men until they are 40 , when raising a family takes over for many			0
author and family researcher @entity110 said : ‘ if you have to juggle work and family , it is very difficult to juggle with more than one child			0
’ with more women choosing to delay starting a family , the number who have their first child before turning 20 has also dramatically fallen since the 1950s			1

women who were born in 1968 went on to have average of 1.92 children
for those born in 1941 , the figure was 2.34 children , @entity35 study shows
number having first child before turning 20 dramatically down since 1950s
