by @entity0 published : 07:29 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 05:46 est , 30 august 2013 a woman has spoken of her devastation after discovering she caught @entity3 from an ex-boyfriend			1
@entity5 , 38 , thought she had found the love of her life when she met @entity9 - born @entity8 in 2007			1
but less than two years later their relationship broke down			0
it would be a further year - and - a - half before she would be given the life - shattering news he was @entity3 - positive			1
but less than two years later their relationship broke down and she was given the life - shattering news he had @entity3 describing him as a ' gentleman ' , ms @entity5 said that when she initially met mr @entity8 , she hoped he would help look after her family			1
' he always made me feel special - he was very complimentary to me and my children , ' she said on @entity29 's @entity28			2
' he took an interest in my children and he fitted in well with my family			0
he was always there to give love and support			2
' but the romance was short - lived and a year into the relationship the couple started having , as ms @entity5 described it , ' trust - issues '			1
the mother - of - two said : ' he started to go out a lot and would turn him phone off			2
' six months later , the couple split , but they stayed on good terms and he still took an active interest in her children			1
mr @entity8 ( pictured ) denied he knew he had carried @entity3 up until he death , earlier this month			1
he was charged with @entity53 for passing on the virus but his case did n't go to trial in time dr @entity58 ( left ) , who also appeared on the programme , said : ' if you think you might be at risk then you must get a test - fortunately it 's a lot easier to get tested			1
' and if you do n't want your gp knowing , you can go to a sexual health clinic where a test wo n't show up on your medical record ' it was n't until 2010 , when police turned up at ms @entity5 's door , that she discovered she had contracted the virus			1
if a person is exposed to the virus , @entity73 medication may stop a person becoming infected so long as it is take within 72 hours			0
for it to be effective , the medication , called post-exposure prophylaxis or @entity78 , must be started within 72 hours of coming into contact with the virus			0
the quicker pep is started the better - the longer the wait , the less chance of it being effective			0
@entity78 has been misleadingly popularised as a ' morning - after pill ' for @entity3			1
@entity78 is a month - long treatment , which has serious side effects and is not guaranteed to work			0
the treatment involves taking the same drugs prescribed to people who have tested positive for @entity3			1
a person can gain access to @entity78 from hospitals , @entity94 departments , sexual health clinics , or genitourinary medicine ( @entity98 ) clinics			0
gps usually do not provide @entity78			0
' police turned up at my house and asked me what my sexual history was			2
' i did n't answer at first and asked why they needed to know			0
' they said they had a man waiting to be deported and needed to clarify his relationship history			0
' it quickly became apparent that the man in question was mr @entity8			1
before foreign nationals are deported they are tested for the virus and his test had come back positive			2
the former shop worker was told she needed an urgent test and her results were fast - tracked			1
the following day it was confirmed she too was @entity3 - positive			1
' it completely turned my world upside , ' said ms @entity5			1
' i was in shock and couldnt believe it			0
' when the viral load test came back it also told me i had just six to nine months to live			0
' if a person has contracted @entity3 it is essential treatment be started immediately , or as soon as possible			2
if it is caught within 72 hours of transmission , a person can even fight off the virus			0
ms @entity5 had however lived with the virus for three years without knowing and needed urgent treatment			1
luckily swift intervention after her shock diagnosis has managed to keep her alive			0
despite the ' news ' that ms @entity141 was carrying the virus , ms @entity5 believes that he knew for many years that he was @entity3 - positive			1
' he was receiving treatment for the condition in 2006 , a year before we met , ' she said			0
' he was fully aware [ he had @entity3 ]			1
' mr @entity8 denied this up until he death , earlier this month			1
he was charged with @entity53 for passing on the virus but his case did n't go to trial in time			0
ms @entity5 is concerned other women may unknowingly have the virus as he went on to have other relationships - and perhaps even one - night stands - after the couple split			1
it is essential to get early treatment for @entity3			2
a person can visit a sexual health clinic without their gp knowing			2
despite the ease with which people can be tested , only a quarter of those infected with @entity3 ( virus pictured ) know they have the disease dr @entity58 , who also appeared on the programme said : ' this story shows that you really ca n't tell who has @entity3 without a test			1
' if you think you might be at risk then you must get a test - fortunately it 's a lot easier to get tested now			0
' and if you do n't want your gp knowing you can go to a sexual health clinic where a test wo n't show up on your medical records			0
' it 's essential to get early treatment - you can go to sexual health clinic without you @entity174 knowing			2
' ' despite this , a quarter of those infected with @entity3 know they have the disease			2
' dr @entity186 added that it 's important to realise that @entity3 is n't a death sentence in the way it was in previous years			2
within the past five years , she said , the ' outlook has revolutionised ' as there are many new drugs on offer			0
' it is so important to have an early dignosis and it can be hard to put up with the drugs as there are some hefty side - effects , ' she explained			0
' but they are a patient 's passport to a healthy life			0
' ms @entity5 remains worried about her future and said : ' i will find it hard to trust anyone ever again			1
i live in a very hard situation right now			0

former shop worker @entity5 thought she had found the love of her life when she met @entity9 - born @entity8 in 2007
but 18 months later the couple split up because of ' trust issues '
in 2010 she received a visit from police who asked if she had slept with mr @entity8 as blood tests at a deportation *centre* had shown he had @entity3
following day she was given news that she too was @entity3 - positive
mr @entity8 denied knowing he had @entity3 until he died but ms @entity5 said he was fully aware that he was carrying the virus when they were together
