when you slick on your mascara and dab on your blusher in a hurry in the morning do you ever stop to think about the consequences it could be having on your heath ? one outspoken beauty guru believes that the products we put on our skin could be damaging our immune system , causing yeast infections and even giving us panic attacks			1
in the same way that we care about what food we put into our mouths , @entity14 maintains the same thought - process should go into our beauty regime before it 's too late			1
the self - confessed beauty junkie tried out all sorts of skincare and make - up through work but as the years went by , she started to lose her hair , memory and , at times , she could n't remember what she had done the day before			2
' i had panic and anxiety attacks continually and my hormones were out of control			0
i found myself getting sicker and weaker and could not get a proper night 's sleep at all , ' she writes on her website			0
' my body was in a constant struggle with candidiasis - a yeast infection throughout my whole body			0
for years , traditional doctors told me there was nothing wrong , until i finally ended up in the hospital with a completely weakened immune system			0
' she finally took responsibility for her own health and paid for some very extensive - and expensive - lab work			0
when one specialist asked her : ' do you work in the cosmetics industry ? ' , something clicked			2
the make - up artist , seen beautifying @entity65 , sticks by the mantra : ' the skin is a mirror to your gut ' , and she speaks from first - hand experience celebrity fans of her range , which uses ingredients such as coconut oil , cocoa butter , bees wax , rosehip oil and vanilla extract , include @entity79 , left , and @entity65 , right she said : ' i was dumbfounded to learn that make - up and skincare products could cause serious health issues			1
sure , companies advertise how their products make us look , but why does n't anybody tell us how they can make us feel ? ' her tests showed that she had toxic levels of the heavy metals lead , cadmium , aluminum , barium and mercury			2
she also had high levels of pesticides and many other chemicals in her system			2
the lab even said to her : ' we ca n't believe you 're even walking around			0
' as a result of her ordeal , several cleanses , and studying nutrition , @entity14 launched her a blog , @entity107 , devoted to exposing the use of chemicals in cosmetics , which she believed was to blame for her ill health			1
she went on to launch her own organic skincare and make - up range , @entity114 , which landed in @entity115 in @entity116 in november			1
@entity14 believes that ingredients in shampoos , hair dyes , and other everyday products may be playing havoc with our hormones that control reproduction			1
' we are polluting our physical form and altering our cell structure with this constant chemical assault , ' she writes on her blog			2
she prides herself on creating a product that 's not only non-toxic , but that actually heals and nourishes skin			2
' i was surprised to learn that the majority of ingredients used for natural cosmetics are refined , bleached , deodorized , clarified , fractionated and heated to high temperatures			0
but this means they are not pure natural ingredients anymore - they are now equivalent to man - made chemicals			0
' no matter how hard the beauty business proclaims innocence , the undeniable truth is that many of the ingredients in make - up and skincare are toxic to our bodies			1
it ’s time to uncover some beauty truths			0
' she explains that her products are formulated with raw , food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state , all the things her friend and client @entity160 loves @entity14 's products , which cost around £ 30 each , include the living luminizer , left , which aims to highlight skin and is loved by @entity166 , and the beauty oil , right , which she says contains only the finest exotic oils and rare herbal extracts ' i consider it my responsibility to share my personal experience and knowledge about these chemicals in our cosmetic ' skincare products so that you too can make informed decisions about your own health and beauty , ' she said			1
she explains that her products are formulated with raw , food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state , allowing their living , healing attributes to penetrate and rejuvenate the skin			1
' in their purest form , enzymes , vitamins , antioxidants and their healing properties remain fully intact , encouraging amazing potential for anti-aging effects , ' she claims			0
celebrity fans of her range , which uses ingredients such as coconut oil , cocoa butter , bees wax , rosehip oil and vanilla extract , include supermodels @entity65 , @entity21 and @entity202			1
