by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 24 july 2012 updated : 13:46 est , 24 july 2012 they were inseparable for almost 30 years , travelling the world together climbing its toughest peaks			1
but now @entity4 is having to adjust to life without her beloved husband @entity6 , 55 , who two weeks ago was leading a group up a peak when he and eight others were swept away by the ' deadliest @entity11 avalanche in years '			1
close friends @entity13 , 48 , and @entity14 , 47 , who lived on the same street in the village of @entity17 , near @entity18 , died alongside mr @entity6 on the 4,649ft @entity19 , when a block of snow 60ft high and 500ft wide hit them in the early hours of thursday , july 12			1
inseparable : @entity6 and his beloved wife @entity4 on the summit of 6376m @entity24 in @entity25 mr @entity6 has been described as a climber born ' with boot - shaped feet ' , intent on treading lightly and respectfully , always carrying down any rubbish he found left on mountains and careful not to take risks with himself or the climbers he helped guide for a living			1
on one occasion in 1993 , on @entity35 , he even found and carried down bones and clothing belonging to @entity38 , who was also swept to his death by an avalanche in 1953			1
mr @entity6 was also the first person to ascent @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , and throughout most of his 30 - year career he had one constant beside him , his beloved wife @entity46 - @entity46 ' i loved being with him , we did so much together , i feel so lucky to have had those years with him , ' she told @entity49 today			1
' honestly , i am not sure how i will feel , but i am fairly sure i will go back to work in the mountains			1
' i live in the mountains , they are all around me , and they hold so many good memories for me , of @entity6			1
it was too much a part of both our lives			2
it would be difficult to walk away from that			2
' adventurers : the husband and wife team travelled the world climbing mountains , pictured here in @entity25 doing what they loved tragedy : @entity6 , pictured with his wife @entity4 , died in the avalanche along with 8 others together the couple of 27 years set up a successful mountaineering company that ran tours across the @entity11 while also exploring mountains around the world on their own			1
' we had big plans to reach unclimbed summits and find new routes but it was always with the understanding that the conditions could change at any minute			2
' it was always more important to be safe and turn around and come back rather than keep going and take a risk with our lives			2
we always had a very practical approach			2
for us , being together was the most important thing			2
' in our personal climbing we wanted to say that we had pushed ourselves to the limit and achieved things that we knew we were capable of			2
' but in our work lives the safety and security of people we took up mountains was so important			2
whatever they wanted to climb , we would always do everything we could to make sure that we would bring them back , and be safe ourselves			2
' but there was nothing he could do when the deadly avalanche struck the group of 28 climbers			2
born adventurer : @entity6 loved nothing more than climbing , especially with his wife by his side another summit : @entity6 on the slopes beneath the summit of @entity113 , @entity114 ' that is what is so sad about what happened when @entity6 , @entity14 and @entity13 died , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' it was a place that had brought them so much joy , where they had been so safe for so long			0
it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that it happened this way			0
' it was a freak accident			1
i know that , and that is why it is very hard to cope with			0
' mr @entity6 , who had developed an avalanche training programme , met his future wife , then a climbing instructor from @entity133 , on a mountain in @entity135			1
they married in 1987 and lived in a chalet in @entity138 , @entity139 , in the @entity11			0
' we met on an expedition at a base camp party that @entity6 ’s team mates had organised			1
i guess it was our love of mountaineering that brought us together and two years later we married , ' she said			0
natural born climber : @entity6 exploratory mountaineering in @entity152 , @entity153 success : mr @entity6 during the descent of @entity24 in @entity25 speaking for the first time after his death , she has paid tribute to her ' generous and loving ' husband			1
' he was not like anyone else			0
we were together for 27 years and i feel like i learnt a huge amount from him , ' she told @entity49			1
' he was a very good man , an extremely generous and loving man			0
even after 27 years i still admired him and he inspired me			0
he was always thinking of what he would do next			0
' in 1999 on the infamous @entity168 peak in @entity169 the pair were trapped on the mountain 's edge by avalanches and snow storms , which they were lucky to escape			1
' we were trying to find a new route and had put up tents on a ridge and then it just began to snow for days			1
we could n't get up or down			0
killed : @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , who both died in the avalanche , were lifelong best friends who lived on the same street in @entity17 , @entity183 tragedy : experienced climber @entity6 was killed by the avalanche in the @entity11			1
on the right , he is pictured during a climb in the @entity188 ' we waited for a break in the weather and we tried to get back down			0
then incredibly really the sun burnt through and up there it can go from very cold to extremely warm very quickly			0
' this caused a small avalanche , that led to a big one which hit us			0
luckily we had fixed a rope to the ridge above and luckily they held us when the avalanche hit us			0
' that was probably the closest call we ever had			0
it did make us think			0
' his tearful 91 - year - old mother @entity205 , of @entity207 , @entity208 , said it best when she spoke about her son and his wife just after he died			1
‘ they were made for each other , ’ she said			0
‘ they had a lovely life			0
now @entity46 is all by herself and i do n’t know what she will do			0
’ it appears that she now has an answer , @entity4 will continue to do what the inseparable couple both loved to do together - climb mountains			1
