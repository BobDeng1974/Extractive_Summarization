@entity0 pulled his shirt across his mouth before smiling at @entity3 , as if to declare a truce in their feud			0
there was little else for @entity9 to laugh about as the second @entity10 stuttered towards another stalemate			0
@entity9 go into the last day here , just as they did in @entity13 , needing eight wickets to have any chance of the victory they so badly need in this series			0
one of them belongs to their old nemesis @entity3 who , along with the obdurate @entity21 , saw @entity22 into credit and within sight of another draw with only the final test in @entity27 next week to play			1
@entity3 had the chance to renew his feud with @entity0 but the pair buried the hatchet on a day the @entity22 dominated @entity32 leaves the field after being left stranded on 182 not out after a stunning display of batting on the fourth morning in @entity36 the 24 - year - old looks dismayed following @entity39 's careless mistake in between the wickets cost him a shot at a double century @entity9 's rising star had been in imperious form as he built yet another ' daddy ' hundred while wickets fell around him before his error , @entity39 had played his part as a no 11 with intelligence , supporting @entity32 sensibly and keeping off strike @entity32 plays the ball away for another boundary as @entity54 captain @entity53 on his way to yet another big score 110 @entity32 has a @entity58 average of 110.1 in the last year			1
he has converted four of his six tons into 150s — the fourth best record in tests if that is a frustrating scenario for @entity9 then at least they seemed to decide on friday there was no point in further antagonising @entity3			0
the eccentric @entity67 had put one over on @entity0 with his salute on the third evening , and @entity9 stopped sledging and concentrated on trying to get @entity3 out			0
so far they have failed			0
@entity70 brought @entity0 back when @entity3 arrived at the fall of @entity22 ’ second wicket , but his four - over burst failed to earn a breakthrough			1
the rest of @entity9 ’s attack toiled , too			0
@entity22 ended this fourth day on 202 for two , a lead of 37 , with @entity21 unbeaten on 101 , and the only winner on day five looks likely to be the lifeless pitch unless @entity9 make big inroads with the second new ball			1
@entity9 were all out when @entity39 strolled back to his wicket which led to his run out following a fine catch by @entity84 @entity22 star holder leaps in the air before hitting the stumps to end @entity32 's chance of scoring 200 runs @entity84 takes the bails off while @entity39 makes his way to the crease without sliding his bat on the floor earlier , @entity39 had left @entity32 stranded with one of the doziest pieces of cricket imaginable as @entity9 threw away their chance of reaching 500			1
it may seem harsh to criticise a tail - ender who had hung around valiantly in a last - wicket stand of 34 as @entity32 moved majestically to his latest ‘ daddy ’ hundred			1
yet it beggared belief that any international player could be run out in quite such a dopey way			0
@entity32 had reached 182 and been imperious as one team - mate after another got themselves out softly before the third and most frustrating run - out			1
@entity39 was ambling back for a second run and broke the first rule of schoolboy cricket by taking his eye off the ball			2
he seemed convinced it was going to the other end , or that the throw would pass over the head even of the giant @entity84			0
instead , @entity84 leapt to take it and had time to remove the bails with @entity39 making no attempt to ground his bat			2
so , @entity39 would have been delighted with his 387th @entity58 wicket as he swung the ball in at @entity127 and saw the local boy became the latest batsman to drag the ball on to his stumps on this slow pitch			2
it gave @entity9 a crucial early breakthrough as @entity22 , 165 behind on first innings , began their attempt to bat for four of the five remaining sessions that would effectively save this @entity10			1
yet any thoughts @entity9 had of a collapse and even a four - day victory were dashed as the match reverted to type , with wickets hard to come by on a pitch showing little sign of decline			0
@entity21 is a batsman who needs little invitation to dig in and the solid @entity27 was in his element as he frustrated @entity9 in a stand of 142 with @entity150 that wiped off the bulk of @entity22 ’ deficit			1
it was a display of old - fashioned application that has been sadly lacking in @entity156 cricket but it was one that left @entity70 devoid of options			0
when another wicket came it was a surprise , @entity150 getting a thin edge to a delivery from @entity164 when he had made 69			1
yet with @entity166 looking rusty on his return , there was little mystery nor imagination in @entity9 ’s attack			0
at least they could savour @entity32 ’s fourth score of 150 plus in his six test hundreds			2
the last four have all finished unbeaten , one of them on 149			0
there were also four sixes as @entity32 became the second youngest @entity176 , after @entity70 , to reach @entity10 runs , an achievement that has come in 43 innings , one fewer even than @entity177 managed it			2
how @entity9 needed @entity32 at his best because after his stand of 165 with @entity182 had been ended on the third day , the lower middle order and tail all hurried themselves out			2
@entity32 and @entity39 made up as they returned to the pavilion for lunch during @entity22 ' second innings @entity186 was one of three @entity176 batsmen run out in their second innings , despite a despairing dive to make his ground @entity39 began to make amends almost immediately when he bowled @entity127 , off yet another inside edge on the slow wicket @entity164 's woes with the bat continued , as he found a new way to get out , edging a sweep into the air without scoring it looked like being a frustrating day all round for @entity164 , as the @entity22 set about nullifying @entity9 's lead on a dead pitch @entity164 eventually found @entity9 's second breakthrough of the day , removing @entity150 who edged a good delivery behind @entity166 looked rusty on his return from injury , and @entity32 's bowling was often preferred to the nominally first - choice spinner @entity150 cuts the ball through the field as the @entity54 batsmen closed the gap on @entity9 quickly during the afternoon and evening @entity150 and @entity21 were relatively untroubled for a long period of the day , as they put on 142 for the second wicket @entity217 got over-excited and was stumped , before @entity186 also ran himself out after showing a few glimpses of the batting quality which will surely one day earn him a test century of his own			1
it was no surprise when @entity164 failed again as his batting has seemed in steep decline since he was hit in the face at @entity226 last year by a ball from @entity228 of @entity229 , however much he tries to convince himself it is not			2
there was a time when @entity164 , who hit a brilliant hundred against @entity234 at @entity235 in 2010 , looked like a genuine all - rounder but now there is even an argument that @entity39 should bat above him			1
as long as he does not run himself out quite so soppily			0
@entity9 's two fast bowlers , @entity164 and @entity39 , discuss tactics with skipper @entity70 as they look to take wickets @entity21 cuts away for more runs as the young opener made @entity9 's attack toil in the @entity54 heat @entity21 acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half - century , and the @entity22 batsman would go on to make three figures @entity39 wipes the sweat from his forehead on another difficult day for @entity9 's bowlers on a tour featuring flat pitches @entity0 looks back as the ball passes him on its way to the boundary , as the @entity22 retook the lead on day four @entity186 appeals vociferously , but unsuccesfuly , as @entity9 found wickets hard to come by on day four			1

@entity32 is left stranded on 182 *** after @entity39 is run out , seemingly not *paying* attention
@entity32 reacted *angrily* , before @entity39 immediately began to make amends with early wicket
@entity22 *responded* *strongly* with the bat , with @entity21 and @entity150 building big *partnership*
@entity164 finally *dismissed* @entity150 but the @entity54 batsmen continued to pile on the runs
@entity21 reaches his century *shortly* before the close , as @entity22 establish a lead on day four
