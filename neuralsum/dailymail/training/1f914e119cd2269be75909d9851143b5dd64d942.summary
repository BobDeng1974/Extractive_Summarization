by @entity0 its wares splayed in dazzlingly pink neat rows , this is the remote forest depot where thousands of phone booths go to die			2
some 3,000 pink and yellow boxes are stored at the secluded site near @entity9 - and they are being sold to the public for as little as £ 250 each			1
the sale has prompted a wave of nostalgia in @entity14 , where the dominance of mobile phones has rendered the booths largely useless and turned them instead into miniature libraries , personal mementos , custom - built showers and even a recording studio			1
hung up : scattered in pink rows , these are the thousands of @entity14 phone booths which have reached the end of their useful life at a remote forest depot near @entity9			1
@entity32 is now selling them for as little as £ 250 each , but there 's a catch - any buyers will have to lug the 100kg monsters home all by themselves strangely beautiful : the one and a half acre site is hidden in the forest near the town of @entity39 , eastern @entity14			1
yellow booths ( top ) are the oldest and cost most vast : @entity14 photographer @entity42 captured the incredible images of the depot for @entity14 newspapers , prompting a wave of nostalgia in the country the one - and - a - half acre site , buried deep in the woods near the town of @entity51 , is @entity14 's only mass phone box graveyard of its kind			1
nowadays it has few yellow boxes , which are the oldest types , and is full mainly of newer pink phone booths which have had to be discarded through lack of use by @entity32			1
although some will be stored for reuse when other booths in prominent places break , they are being sold to the public for as little as 300 euros ( £ 250 ) each			0
the ' vintage ' yellow boxes command a higher price of 450 euros ( £ 370 )			0
there is a catch , however - buyers must find a way to lug the 300lb ( 135kg ) monsters home themselves			2
since the sale began the phone booths have found some quirky uses , @entity32 spokesman @entity73 told @entity77			2
march of the phone booths : those sold already have been turned into greenhouses , recording studios , showers , miniature libraries , movie props and beach shelters @entity32 employee @entity86 said : ' a buyer met his wife 35 years ago against a yellow phone booth and he wanted to surprise her with a copy ' ' often , they also serve as a shelter for technical equipment or be placed in museums , ' he said - but several have been bought by artists			1
some people have put them in their gardens to be used as miniature greenhouses			0
others have turned them into boutique shower rooms			0
more still have become movie props , tiny recording studios , beach shelters and even a soundproof room to make phone calls - from mobiles			0
it may sound surprising , but the firm said many office workers were finding their environment so distracting that it helped to have four metal and glass walls built up around them			0
' telephone booth awaken in many people fond memories , ' said @entity32 employee @entity86 - revealing one buyer even met his wife next to one of the booths			1
she said : ' a prospective buyer had volunteered for example , because he had met his wife 35 years ago against a yellow phone booth and he wanted to surprise her with a copy			1
' overtaken by nature : weighing more than 100kg each , many of the phone booths have languished at the depot for some time			2
here , a tree appears to grow from one spot the depot : this satellite image shows the sheer scale of the site compared to the nearby town of @entity39 , just outside @entity9			0
once indispensable , such booths have been in terminal decline since the dawn of mobile phones , with the number across @entity14 dropping from 100,000 to 40,000 in just over a decade but the most common idea of all , mr @entity73 told @entity77 , was to turn the booths into public libraries			1
the sale began at the end of last year , and is likely to go on for some time as phone booths gradually vanish from public life			0
once the only way for children to tell parents they were alive or for jobseekers to apply for work , the metal boxes have been in terminal decline worldwide since the dawn of mobile phones			0
in 2003 , there were still more than 100,000 across @entity14 - but in many areas they have been gradually eliminated or replaced with cheaper , easier - to - run wall - mounted models			2
now there are only around 40,000 left .			0

more than 3,000 pink and yellow booths are stored at the @entity32 site near @entity51 , eastern @entity14
buyers turn them into greenhouses , showers and libraries - but have to take home the 100kg beasts themselves
one buyer wanted to surprise his wife with a yellow phone box because they met next to one 35 years ago
