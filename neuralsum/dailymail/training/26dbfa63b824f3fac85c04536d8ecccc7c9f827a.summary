after weeks of discussion about what @entity9 chose not to wear on holiday in @entity12 , another controversy has erupted over an item of clothing that she did put on in the @entity16			1
at an official dinner to celebrate the nation ’s culture , she wore a pretty sundress which she believed to be by a local designer – but which was actually made more than 3,000 miles away in the @entity23			1
in a fiercely - worded statement , the government said it had been agreed in advance with the royal guests that they would wear ‘ something that would connect easily with the ordinary @entity16 ’			2
organisers arranged for @entity44 to be provided with a green ‘ island shirt ’ featuring a map of the islands and coconut trees , while @entity9 was to bring a summer dress of her own			2
however , ahead of the royal couple ’s arrival on the first stop of their recent tour , mrs @entity32 was let into their hotel room to leave gifts of flowers , chocolate and soap on behalf of the organising committee			0
@entity9 and @entity44 pose wearing traditional @entity23 clothing during a visit to @entity26 , @entity64 , one of the @entity16 the @entity16 , where @entity9 and @entity44 attended the party , and the @entity23 , 2779.78 miles away , where the clothes they accidentally wore were actually from unfortunately , according to the government statement , she also ‘ smuggled in ’ two items of clothing made by a designer from the @entity23 – a garish blue shirt for @entity44 and the @entity9 ’s bandeau dress , which were laid on the couple ’s bed			1
@entity9 wears the traditional @entity23 dress while she talks with the wife of the governor general of the @entity16 , @entity78 , in @entity26 when the royal party arrived , a week ago last sunday , a member of their staff noticed the shirt left for the @entity25 was blue rather than green and checked with the government ’s head of protocol – who assured them that the clothes were , indeed , official ones			1
but to add to the comedy of errors , it seems that the @entity25 ’s real shirt ( as well as a dress for @entity9 , just in case ) had been hidden by their bags			1
delighted by the gift , @entity9 ditched her original outfit to wear it , and the fashion world was quick to proclaim that it highlighted the talent of young designers in the emerging third world nation			2
but then , of course , its true origin emerged			0
a government spokesman said : ‘ @entity109 wore the dress because she believed it to be from the @entity16 government and thought it would be an appropriate gesture			1
had she known it were from the @entity23 it would not have been worn and she feels bad about the confusion			0
‘ we are incredibly frustrated that this situation has come about and see @entity32 as entirely to blame			0
’ mrs @entity32 , who is understood to be an existing client of the @entity23 designer , said it was an ‘ unfortunate incident ’ and that she had no intention of embarrassing the couple or the local government			0
a @entity125 spokesman said last night : ‘ the situation arose through no fault of @entity16 government or the royal household			0

@entity25 and @entity9 attended @entity16 party this month
it was part of their @entity135 tour of the @entity136 and @entity137
@entity9 believed the pretty sundress for official dinner was by a local designer
