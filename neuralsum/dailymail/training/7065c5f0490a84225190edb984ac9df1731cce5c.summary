the women paid 62p an hour in @entity1 making £ 45 ‘ feminist ’ t - shirts earn less than the ‘ living wage ’ set by the government of the @entity6 island			1
after our revelations last week about the ‘ sweatshop ’ conditions endured by workers producing the garments , @entity7 has discovered that the women ’s pay falls far short of the £ 1.47 an hour set by the official statistics office , and designed to provide a decent , basic level of income			1
unions and campaigners last night condemned high street chain whistles and left - wing women ’s rights group @entity23 for refusing to withdraw the t - shirt , made by women living 16 to a room			1
the women paid 62p an hour at the @entity29 factory ( pictured ) in @entity1 making £ 45 ‘ feminist ’ t - shirts earn less than the ‘ living wage ’ set by the government of the @entity6 island whistles was described as ‘ sticking its head in the sand ’ by one major union following @entity7 ’s revelations about the conditions in which the ‘ this is what a @entity37 ’ t - shirts are made at the @entity38 [ @entity29 ] workcamp			1
the new revelations came as : labour leader @entity42 , his deputy @entity43 , and @entity44 were all photographed for @entity45 in the shirts			0
after our exclusive story last week , the shirts were withdrawn from sale in @entity51 while it conducted an investigation			0
two days later , the shirts were back on shelves when the store , the charity and the magazine all declared they were satisfied the factory conditions at @entity29 conformed to ‘ ethical standards ’			2
significantly , the statement did not contradict the women ’s rate of pay or living conditions , it merely said they are paid above the minimum wage and had union representation			1
but even the @entity1 government ’s director of labour , @entity69 , admitted : ‘ the minimum wage has not been reviewed since 1984 , it has only received small increases in line with inflation			1
' wages need to increase , they are outdated			0
’ yet the @entity23 – which vows to fight against low and unequal pay for women – triumphantly tweeted : ‘ latest t - shirt update : evidence we have seen categorically refutes assertion they were produced in a sweatshop			1
’ later they added : ‘ oh well , guess we ’ll have to get by without those 11 million @entity83 readers , aww shucks ! ’ ' satisfied ' : whistles say they are happy with conditions at the @entity29 factory despite the poverty wages the @entity7 understands that no one from @entity51 , @entity45 or the @entity23 has travelled to @entity1 to investigate our story , although @entity51 indicated yesterday that an inspection is planned by a ‘ senior member ’ of its team			1
instead , the company relied on an audit of conditions , carried out last month			0
the @entity23 said they were initially assured that the 300 t - shirts would be produced in the @entity99 and were ‘ surprised ’ to discover they were produced in @entity1			1
international trade union @entity101 added : ‘ @entity51 is sticking its head in the sand			2
the government - mandated minimum wage has not been revised for 30 years			2
it ’s currently 4,300 rupees a month [ £ 86 ] which is below the poverty line it is no surprise that women work enormous extra hours to supplement their poverty wages			0
' a company sourcing from a factory with any indication of exploitation should not try to hide behind a smokescreen			0
’ @entity29 boss @entity116 last week confirmed that the migrant women from @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 were paid £ 120 a month basic wage – equivalent to 62p an hour			1
the company claims that the dormitory accommodation and three meals a day they provide effectively brings the women ’s salaries up to £ 210 , but even that falls far short of the £ 290 voluntary living wage set by the @entity1 government			1
to achieve that , the women should be paid £ 1.47 an hour – not 62p			1
the claim by @entity51 – whose chief executive @entity134 is believed to earn £ 300,000 a year – that the workers had union representation was also questioned by @entity138 , president of the island ’s @entity139			1
@entity141 was mocked for refusing five requests from women ’s magazine @entity45 to pose for a photograph in the ‘ @entity147 ’ t - shirt			2
yet last week , @entity7 found leading figures from @entity51 , the @entity23 and @entity45 were just as reluctant to be photographed in their own t - shirt – despite continuing to sell them			2
we , too , made five requests each to @entity51 chief executive @entity134 , @entity45 editor - in - chief @entity152 , the @entity23 ’s chief executive @entity153 and her deputy @entity154			2
blanked : @entity51 chief executive @entity134 , with her husband , ignores the @entity157 reporter @entity158 : @entity45 editor - in - chief @entity152 ( left ) and the @entity23 ’s deputy chief executive dr @entity154 ( right ) ignored requests for comment ms @entity152 refused to pose , while the others ignored our requests			1
we also called at ms @entity134 ’s and ms @entity152 ’s @entity167 homes , taking a t - shirt along with us , but the answer was still no. emerging from her smart townhouse with her husband , ms @entity134 refused to answer any questions about the issue , or acknowledge our reporter			0
... and the questions they wo n't answer after @entity7 report last week , the @entity23 , @entity45 and @entity51 issued statements saying they had seen evidence that stated the ‘ this is what a @entity37 ’ t - shirts were made in ethical conditions			1
a further statement came from @entity51 yesterday			0
pointedly , however , there was no mention anywhere of the 62p - an - hour pay rate – or the fact the workers sleep 16 to a dorm			2
here , we print crucial questions we put to the @entity23 , @entity51 and @entity45 following that statement , with their responses : do you think it is ethical to pay workers 62p an hour to make a £ 45 t - shirt ? whistles : ‘ all employees are paid above the government - mandated minimum wage			1
’ do you think it is ethical that the women must sleep 16 to a room ? response : no comment do you think it is ethical that the woman are encouraged not to leave the site between shifts , as factory boss mr @entity116 told us ? response : no comment the @entity1 government has set a ‘ living wage ’ of £ 1.47 an hour			1
the workers are paid less than half this			0
is this ethical ? response : no comment after the @entity157 report , the @entity23 and @entity51 implied that conditions are acceptable			2
did any of your representatives go to @entity1 in the past week to gain this information first hand ? whistles : ‘ we are undertaking a further independent review and a senior member of the @entity51 team will conduct a detailed site inspection and talk to employees at the factory			1
’ the only union within @entity29 is the @entity233 and @entity234 , which official figures show has 1,052 members in the whole of @entity1			2
that is just eight per cent of the 13,000 @entity29 workers , even if it had no other members elsewhere			0
legally a union can only demand collective bargaining power if it represents 30 per cent of staff , but companies can grant the same right to smaller unions			0
the union is led by @entity248 , who accompanied the @entity157 on our tour of the factory last week			0
at that time , he described the conditions as a ‘ sweatshop ’ and condemned the pay and conditions			2
since then , our efforts to contact him have been in vain , but @entity29 issued a letter he wrote claiming the quotes attributed to him were ‘ totally false ’			0
how @entity157 revealed the truth about the t - shirts @entity138 said the @entity29 has stopped her approaching foreign workers about joining an independent union			1
she described the accommodation complex as ‘ like a prison ’			0
in a statement last week , mr @entity116 denied the factory was a ‘ sweatshop ’ , and claimed the women who represent 80 per cent of his workforce had access to leisure facilities			2
but on our tour , it was only in the men ’s block that we saw a gym , library , tv room and sports pitches			0
security guards at a @entity29 factory in @entity287 yesterday herded workers inside their dormitories to stop them from talking to our reporters			0
@entity291 , 62 , told us : ‘ normally the women are allowed outside on saturday but my friend told me they were locking them in to stop them talking to journalists			0
they say it is like a prison			0
’ @entity29 has a chequered history , but says it has improved conditions in recent years			0
in 2005 , riot police fired tear gas as 300 @entity303 workers protested that a colleague had been effectively worked to death			0
whistles said it had nothing to add to its statement last week insisting it was ‘ committed to ethical sourcing ’ adding that an audit last month found that ‘ all employees are paid above the government - mandated minimum wage ; employees are paid according to their skills and period of service ; there is no forced labour ; there is a policy for freedom of association and collective bargaining ; there are regular workers ’ meetings			1
’ the @entity23 and @entity45 refused to answer our questions .			0

women are paid 62p an hour in @entity1 to make £ 45 ' feminist ' t - shirts
hourly rate less than ' living wage ' set by government of @entity6 island
comes after @entity157 revelations about the ' sweatshop ' conditions endured by workers
women **'s** pay falls far short of £ 1.47 an hour set by official statistics office
unions condemn those *stocking* ' this is what a feminist looks like ' shirts
high street chain @entity51 is described as ' sticking its head in the sand '
left - wing women **'s** rights group @entity358 also faces *criticism*
whistles announced that the women earn more than the @entity1 minimum wage - *44p* an hour - but the government admits this has not been reviewed since 1984 and is ‘ outdated ’ .
we established that fewer than eight per cent of the workforce belong to a union , despite @entity51 and the @entity23 claiming the women had union representation .
our journalists were followed and spied upon by guards from @entity29 as they travelled around @entity1 .
@entity376 , founder of feminist magazine @entity377 , writes in today ’s @entity157 that the @entity23 should be ‘ *ashamed* ’ and has ‘ betrayed the cause of feminism ’ .
the story *divided* opinion on the @entity383 , with one reader on @entity386 ’s website saying : ‘ i hate the @entity7 as much as the next @entity386 reader ... but they are right about this . ’
since publication of this *article* @entity69 , the @entity1 @entity394 ’s director of labour , has asked to add that although minimum wages for the @entity397 have not been reviewed since 1984 , wages are adjusted for inflation every year in the salary *compensation* *scheme* , with the lowest - paid workers receiving more . he said the @entity402 has been asked to conduct a review .
