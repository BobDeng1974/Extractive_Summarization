jailing burglars @entity25 and @entity26 for four years each , judge @entity23 had told @entity27 : ' i make it plain that , in my judgment , being shot is not mitigation			1
' if you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun , that is the chance you take			1
' you can not come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it			0
