by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 29 november 2013 updated : 05:20 est , 30 november 2013 an 999 call handler who was sending an ambulance to a nursery where a baby girl was choking ended the call by saying : ' jeez , stop giving me information ' , an inquest heard			1
@entity10 emergency medical dispatcher @entity9 made the comment after she put down the phone , unaware she was still being recorded			0
the 999 call was played to a jury at the inquest into the death of nine - month - old @entity17 , who died at @entity19 private nursery in @entity20 , @entity21 , in october last year			1
an emergency medical dispatcher has admitted she made two ' fundamental ' errors while responding to a call as @entity17 was choking a member of staff at the nursery called for an ambulance and told ms @entity9 that @entity17 had begun choking and crying and had turned ' a bit purple ' after she ate shepherd 's pie for lunch			1
the call came to an end after ms @entity9 took details of @entity17 's condition , gave the caller instructions and told her an ambulance was on its way			1
ms @entity9 said as she ended the call : ' @entity41 ... @entity42 , stop giving me information			1
' an inquest at @entity45 was told nursery staff and paramedics were unable to save @entity17 , from @entity49 , @entity50			1
paramedic @entity51 said : ' i do n't think there was anything else i could have done			0
' in a statement read to the court , ms @entity9 admitted she did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation and did not stay on the line to monitor @entity17 ’s condition			1
she said she began to ask a series of scripted questions when she received the call			2
she was given the address of the scene and was then informed that a baby was choking , crying , still breathing but was going ' a bit purple '			2
@entity68 and @entity69 with their daughter @entity17 , who died last year after choking at a nursery ms @entity9 continued to ask further scripted questions and learned the child was not breathing normally after she had choked			1
she told a nursery assistant not to slap @entity17 on the back any longer because that could cause a further lodging of any food stuck down the throat			1
then continuing to follow the prompted questions , she advised the youngster should not eat or drink anything			0
she should also be rested in the most comfortable position on her side in case she vomited			0
ms @entity9 ended the call by asking the school to ring back immediately if anything changed			2
following a review of the call , she admitted she had made the ' fundamental errors '			1
she stated : ' when told the patient was going purple , i did not click this indicated breathing problems			2
' staff at @entity19 private nursery in @entity20 , @entity100 , rang for assistance after @entity17 got into breathing difficulties after she was fed shepherd 's pie this should have generated a more immediate response and not a continuation of the scripts she followed , she said			1
she went on : ' i should have stayed on the line to monitor the patient ’s breathing and not exit the call			1
' explaining that she had suffered a stillbirth herself , she said the thought that her actions could have contributed to a death ' has devastated me '			0
the inquest heard how the 999 call hander made mistakes in how she graded the call last october she added she considered it an ' isolated error ' and said she thought the automatic prompting system should be improved			2
ms @entity9 , who was not present at the hearing , is still employed by the same ambulance service but now works in a different control room			0
addressing the jury on the opening day of the inquest yesterday , @entity17 ’s mother @entity68 said all she wanted to know was how her ' perfectly healthy ' daughter did not come home from the nursery			1
@entity17 started coughing and crying during her mashed feed in a high chair before her lips turned blue			1
nursery staff performed first aid on the youngster as they waited for emergency assistance on october 23			1
an ambulance arrived 10 minutes later but @entity17 had gone into cardiac arrest and less than a hour later she was pronounced dead at @entity143			1
a recording of the 999 phone call was played to the jury			2
at the end of the call , when the operator says goodbye , she is still being recorded as she says : ' jeez , stop giving me information			1
' @entity100 coroner @entity152 said he expected her employers to take action over that comment			0
earlier a nursery assistant told her : ' she ’s crying , she ’s breath			2
. she ’s crying and she seems to be breathing			2
but she seems to be choking a little bit			0
she ’s still ... she just crying at the minute and it seems to have been happening for three minutes now , she seems to be going a little bit discoloured , a little bit purply			0
' @entity161 , section manager in the emergency control room , said the call operator should have graded a ' red response ' of an immediate threat to life			1
the inquest heard how that requires a vehicle response within eight minutes			0
@entity17 , pictured with her father @entity169 , started coughing and crying during her mashed feed in a high chair before her lips turned blue asked why ms @entity9 had not chosen that option , ms @entity161 said : ' the call operator did not follow her training and did not identify @entity17 had ineffective breathing at the start of the call			1
' the word " purple " or " blue " or " gasping for breath " acts as a trigger for an immediate red response before any more questions are asked			0
' she explained that made no practical difference in this case as to how quickly the ambulance arrived but a rapid response car might have got there one or two minutes sooner			0
ms @entity161 said the operator did not have an explanation as to why she did not stay on the line but said she felt she had been ' bombarded with details '			2
@entity68 and @entity69 were pictured outside @entity199 yesterday at the inquest into their daughter 's death mr @entity152 said : ' what i can not understand is there can only be in my mind no more important a call than a baby choking ? ' the witness said : ' i totally agree with you			2
she should have stayed on the line			0
' the coroner suggested : ' this was a complete aberration			0
' ms @entity161 replied : ' yes			0
' @entity161 , section manager in the emergency control room , said the call operator should have graded a ' red response ' of an immediate threat to life the inquest heard that so far no disciplinary proceedings have been taken against the call operator			1
all the service ’s emergency medical despatchers - who are not medically trained - have since received retraining on calls regarding choking			0
ms @entity9 returned to work about six months ago in the same role , although a doctor ruled her medically unfit to give evidence this week at the inquest or in the foreseeable future			0
earlier , paramedic @entity51 told the hearing he ' immediately knew ' it was not a normal choking incident when he arrived at the nursery			2
' it appeared more serious , ' he said			0
he described @entity17 as looking ' floppy and pale ' with ' quite blue - ish lips '			1
her heart was not beating in the ambulance and he failed with various attempts to resuscitate her before a decision was made to rush her to hospital			0
@entity17 had no signs of life on arrival at @entity143 and was pronounced dead soon afterwards			1
emergency medical technician @entity250 arrived at the nursery in a second , back - up ambulance			2
she recalled a conversation with a woman wearing a dark suit who was beside the vehicle as other medics battled to save @entity17 's life			1
' i asked her what happened , ' she said			0
' she said that @entity17 had had a bit of a coughing do and had gone downhill			1
' asked if that woman had been forthcoming with answers to her questions , the witness said : ' she was very non-committal			0
' the police had arrived by this time			0
she seemed to be looking down the driveway to see what was going on			0
' i asked the lady if she ( @entity17 ) had any medical history , any underlying problems			1
she said " no , i do n't know "			0
' the hearing continues next tuesday			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
