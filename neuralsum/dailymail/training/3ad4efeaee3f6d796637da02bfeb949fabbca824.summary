back in the time when @entity2 was known as @entity3 , it was chariot racing that divided the city			0
there were four teams - the @entity8 , the @entity9 , the @entity10 and the @entity11 - and one hundred thousand enraptured spectators , from commoners to the emperor himself , would assemble at the giant @entity16 to witness the thunderous clatter of hooves through the blood red dust			0
but loyalties ran far deeper than raceday			0
it was a way of life			0
one did not simply swap allegiances			0
each of the teams represented a particular social group , religious denomination or political faction and each inspired and demanded loyalty			0
@entity32 fans , pictured during their @entity36 play - off against @entity35 , are a passionate bunch @entity37 ( centre ) leads his @entity40 players in training at the @entity41 on wednesday follow all the latest # @entity43 action on : @entity44 : @entity45 @entity46 : @ @entity47 and at @entity48 the sport may have changed quite drastically but @entity2 remains a city split into loyal factions			1
it is a @entity53 outpost where football is the way of life and rouses great passions			0
like the fans of the chariot teams in @entity64 times , the followers of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity32 - to take the city and the whole country 's three most successful teams - will always go that extra mile to try and outdo one another			1
and like those teams of equine chargers , fortunes are always fluctuating			0
right now , it is @entity32 , who take on @entity40 at the @entity41 in the @entity43 , who are in the ascendancy			1
@entity75 ( left ) could make his long - awaited return from injury against the @entity79 side on thursday @entity40 striker @entity80 scores against @entity32 during their first @entity43 clash in october @entity32 currently top the @entity82			1
they have lost just two of their 12 league matches so far and in both were handicapped by having a man sent off			0
the @entity43 has brought further gains for their manager @entity89 , formerly of @entity90 and @entity91 during his playing days			1
like @entity40 , they remain unbeaten in @entity92 and know one last win will take them through as winners			1
and so those passionate fans will take it as their duty to create one of those formidable and fearsome @entity79 atmospheres that have cowed so many visitors in the past			1
it 's a given we will see the booming drums and exploding pyrotechnics within the cavernous 76,000 - seater @entity104 - the venue where @entity106 so miraculously won the @entity36 in 2005 - on thursday night			1
besiktas do n't seem to have been affected by being in a state of flux this season			0
they left their crumbling @entity114 , on the banks of the @entity116 and close to the @entity117 and @entity118 , last year to take up temporary residence at the big @entity121 arena out of the city centre			0
home fans at the @entity41 light flares as they get behind the @entity79 giants back in august @entity80 , who is second top scorer in the @entity43 this season , celebrates his goal against @entity32 kick - off : thursday , december 11 , 6pm tv : @entity130 4 by the end of the campaign , their new home , the @entity133 , is due to be completed - with 9,000 more fans to be accommodated			1
@entity40 would already have sewn up the group if not for @entity139 's last - gasp penalty at @entity140			2
the former @entity90 , @entity142 and @entity143 hotshot has been scoring everywhere for @entity32 and has 16 goals in 18 matches since leaving @entity146			2
luckily for @entity37 and his all - too - often shaky defence , @entity139 is likely to be ruled out of the match with an injured toe			0
not that @entity40 are at all fazed by such hostile places			2
they are unbeaten in 18 @entity43 group stage matches , surviving and thriving in such cauldrons as @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 in the recent past			2
@entity32 striker @entity139 , pictured scoring from the spot against @entity40 , will miss the game with a broken toe the @entity43 has certainly served as a springboard for @entity80			1
his seven goals in the competition seem to have finally convinced @entity37 to install him as the club 's no 1 striker in the @entity167 as well and the @entity169 under 21 man should prosper			2
he is the group phase 's second top scorer , behind @entity171 of @entity172 and so has personal glory to chase in @entity79 's largest city			1
for both these sides , there are incentives to finish on top of the group			2
in the last 32 draw the 12 group winners are combined with the four teams with the best records dropping down from the @entity36			1
@entity183 and @entity184 are just two of the teams they would avoid			0
and , for the first time , the winners of the @entity43 will gain entry into next season 's @entity36			1
a particularly important prize for @entity40 , given their disappointing @entity167 form			2
so , in this bustling , historic metropolis of 14 million people at the crossroads of @entity53 and @entity197 , there is , as there has always been throughout time , everything to play for .			0

@entity32 host @entity40 in the @entity43 on thursday , *ko* 6pm
the @entity79 side are *famous* for their loud , passionate *supporters*
spurs need a point to *guarantee* top spot in @entity92
the winners of the competition will gain entry to the @entity36
