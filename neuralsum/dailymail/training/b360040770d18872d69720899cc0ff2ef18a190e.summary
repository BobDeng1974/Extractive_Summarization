by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 27 march 2013 a daring photographer managed to hold his ground to take these spectacular pictures of an elephant - despite it charging straight towards him			1
incredibly , @entity6 sat unfazed in his camp chair as the five - tonne male dashed out of the savannah and stampeded into the water			1
the pair came within just 30 feet of each other during a tense stand - off at the @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16			1
stand back ! photographer @entity6 incurred the displeasure of this elephant at @entity14 in @entity16 which decided to charge at the 48 - year - old to show him who 's boss too close for comfort : the five - tonne fully - grown male raises its ears into a v position to show it threatening the photographer while splashing water at him but the 48 - year - old from @entity29 , @entity30 , held his nerve as the elephant rushed at him , knowing from experience that the first is usually a mock attack			1
the fully - grown animal - which towered 12 ft high - charged at mr @entity6 three times before concluding he posed no threat and calmly walked away			1
he said : ' it was a blistering hot day and i was sheltering from the heat in the deep shade of a @entity44 tree , right next to the @entity14 channel			1
' this elephant walked out of surrounding savannah , down to water 's edge on the opposite bank to drink			1
' i sat quietly in my camp chair , not moving a muscle , enjoying the experience of being 20 or so metres ( 65ft ) from such a majestic animal			2
making a splash : the elephants marks its territory and gives photographer @entity6 a hosing down in a tense stand - off at the reserve in the @entity15 ' i had been upwind from him , so remained undetected - but as the breeze shifted , he caught my scent			1
' he immediately turned to face me and seeing i was close , he charged without warning straight into the channel in an attempt to scare me off			2
' i had suspected he may do this so had quietly adjusted my camera settings to freeze the action of his charge			0
' having spent a lot of time around elephants on foot before , i also thought his charge would be a mock charge , so when he did charge i did not move apart from raising my camera to shoot a burst of frames			2
' i must admit to having a few moments of thinking " have i got it right ? " , " is this going to be a mockie ? " if i had this wrong i had no chance of escape			0
' but after a few tense moments as the fully - grown male elephant charged towards him , it slowed down - eventually stopping just a few metres from where mr @entity6 was sat. lucky escape : fortunately for mr @entity6 , the charge was just a ' mock attack ' and the elephant left him alone when it realised he was n't a threat he added : ' fortunately , he proved me right by stopping short after a few metres of charging into the water			1
' he backed off a short distance for a half a minute or so before he charged again , thrashing the water with his trunk and spraying water in my direction			0
' i changed my camera from landscape to portrait framing and shot another series of frames , still remaining seating in my camp chair			0
' he backed off again , watched for a short while and then charged for the third time - again splashing and spraying water at me			2
' this time , he came within 10 metres ( 30ft ) of where i sat quietly , apart from raising my camera			0
' after this third charge i suspect the bull realised i was not a threat because he backed off to the opposite edge of the channel			0
' he watched me curiously from the bank and splashed himself with some water to cool off			0
' he also had a long drink before moving off and disappearing back into the bush from where he had come			0
' it was only at this point that i returned to my camp site - in search of a cold beer and with a big smile on my face			2
what a privileged experience that had been			0
' quite an ordeal : the pair got within 30ft of each other during the confrontation			0
after the elephant decided to leave him alone , mr @entity6 returned to his camp site to have a beer and recover from his experience			1
