the truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $ 4,000 to as much as $ 14,000 , depending on the city , according to new data compiled by @entity17			1
using data from @entity20 , the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in @entity23 ; @entity24 ; @entity25 ; @entity26 ; @entity27 and @entity28			2
random : new data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the @entity35 , the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $ 10,000 common procedure : the cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $ 14,000 in most cities , but is a steal in @entity23 at $ 9,000 the results will certainly have @entity26 residents driving to @entity27 if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure			1

herniated disc decompression surgery costs $ 15,000 in @entity23 and more than three and a half times more in @entity26 and @entity27 - more than $ 48,000			0
