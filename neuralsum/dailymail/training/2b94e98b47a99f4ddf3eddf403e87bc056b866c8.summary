by @entity0 school can be a daunting place for children with autism – with many struggling to communicate with peers and stay focussed			1
but one school think they have found a solution – robot teachers			1
@entity9 in @entity10 is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism			1
@entity16 in @entity17 , @entity10 , @entity18 has become the first school in the @entity20 to use a robot to teach autistic children			1
pictured are pupils @entity24 ( left ) , five , and @entity25 ( right ) , five , taking the £ 15,000 robot named ' @entity27 ' for a walk the knee - high machines , which are designed to move in the same way as children , can be programmed to have conversations , play games , dance and even take classes			1
but unlike human teachers , @entity27 and @entity37 – so named by the pupils – have blank features , no emotions and standardised expressions and responses			1
it is this , according to head teacher , @entity44 that makes the robots much easier for autistic to children to relate to and understand			1
‘ autistic children find them less threatening and easier to engage with than adults and other children , so they provide a safe environment for them to explore and develop their communication skills , ’ he said			1
‘ children who first come into school unable to make eye contact with humans start to communicate through the robots			1
‘ they are also cute and lovable which helps capture their attention , ’ he added			0
the mainstream state school , which caters for children without autism , has a centre dedicated to those with the disability – the long - term aim being to get them to integrate into classes with other children			1
unlike human teachers , @entity27 and @entity37 - so named by the pupils - have blank features , no emotions and standardised expressions and responses , which makes the robots much easier for autistic children to relate to and understand			1
pictured are @entity24 ( left ) , five , @entity77 , six , and @entity25 , five a revolution in the classroom ? @entity27 , seen here showing off his @entity81 skills , is one of two robots donated by the @entity84 and @entity85 to the school many autistic children have successfully been able to do so , thanks in part to the way the school has taken on such technology , according to mr @entity44			1
he said several schools have been in touch who are considering investing in the technology themselves			0
before @entity25 ( pictured above ) met @entity37 the robot , she struggled to maintain focus in lessons for more than ten minutes			1
but after a school year of weekly or twice weekly lessons with him , the five - year - old can now concentrate for a 20 minute session and her social skills have dramatically improved			2
her teacher @entity108 says her ability to communicate with others has seen a noticeable improvement , as has her vocabulary			0
‘ she can look at the robot ’s body language and work out if it is shocked or surprised , for example			0
a skill that ’s transferable to real life , ’ he said			0
mr @entity108 , who looks after a class of 6 autistic children , said : ‘ it is lovely to see to see how she lights up with the robot			2
‘ she loves giving it hugs and adores its dancing and when it does “ head shoulders knees and toes ” – mirroring the robot ’s moves			2
’ she ’ll laugh along and copy it doing the @entity135 dance , he said , ‘ and in the morning she ’ll come in and pat it on the head , saying “ are you alright , robot ? ” ’ ‘ there ’s a concentration and willingness to stay with the class that was n’t there before			0
it really engages her and holds her attention for extended periods of time , ’ he added			0
@entity25 ’s father , @entity149 , who also has an autistic son , @entity150 , seven , at the school , said : ‘ she has picked up a lot from the robot			0
she ’ll come back from school and tell us all about the games she ’s been playing			0
‘ we have seen a vast improvement in @entity158 over the past six months			0
‘ it ’s impossible to say how much this is down to the robot because the school has been doing a lot of good work , but i think it ’s a big part of the jigsaw			0
’ mr @entity25 , a driving instructor , said his son is also transfixed by the robot who he calls ‘ @entity170			0
’ ‘ @entity150 thinks it ’s like something out of @entity173 – a toy come to life , ’ he said			2
‘ it has given him confidence and brought him out of his shell			0
‘ my wife and i are blown away by what it can do and are very open - minded to the different technology that ’s out there that can help our kids , ’ he added			0
@entity186 volunteered itself two years ago to become something of a research laboratory for the @entity84 and @entity85 , the creators of the robots			2
@entity85 donated the machines - which cost about £ 15,000 each to produce – to the school , in order to learn how their technology could help children with disabilities			1
‘ it has worked out to be very mutually beneficial , ’ mr @entity44 said			0
‘ they gave us the robots and we report back			2
’ teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer - allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it the knee - high machines , which are designed to move in the same way as children , can be programmed to have conversations , play games , dance and even take classes he explained that the university are constantly developing new features based on suggestions from teachers about what would benefit the pupils			1
for instance , teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer – allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it			1
a feature recently developed even allows teachers and parents to track a child ’s progression by recording all of their results in games played with the robot and by tracking their responses			1
the most popular educational game is ‘ animal recognition ’ , where the robot asks a child to identify a card with a particular animal on			0
a feature recently developed allows teachers and parents to track a child 's progression by recording all of their results in games played with the robot and by tracking their responses ' we 've seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their " best friend " after initially being scared of it , ' said @entity258 , @entity259 at the school for example , the robot will say ‘ find me a cat ’ , and the pupil will have to go through a pack of cards then hold the correct one up to its face			1
if they get it right , the robot will congratulate them and do a dance and if they do n’t it will tell them ‘ hard luck , you could do better ’			0
the response is always exactly the same , to limit any confusion and to ‘ build trust ’ , according to @entity259 at the school , @entity258			0
‘ we ’ve seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their “ best friend ” after initially being scared of it , ’ he said			2
‘ it helps their listening skills and mimicry , also helping them learn how to take it in turns and how to stay focussed - a stepping stone to interaction with people			2
‘ it is also useful in helping teachers control the class , getting them to listen and sit down for instance			2
’ dr @entity303 , director of the @entity84 ’s @entity304 , said : ‘ to be effective in teaching children with autism , it is crucial to find ways to motivate and engage them			1
‘ it is also important to communicate clearly by using simple language and giving children plenty of time to take in instructions			0
‘ the robot does all those things and has therefore been a very effective tool to support the children ’s communication and interaction in the classroom			2
’ dr @entity303 added that a well thought out programme could also work well in mainstream classes			0
‘ if you can meet the needs of children autism you can meet the needs of all children , ’ she said			2
‘ when people feel safe and are motivated they learn much better			0
