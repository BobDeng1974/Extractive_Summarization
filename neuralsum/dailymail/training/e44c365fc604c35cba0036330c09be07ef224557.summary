by @entity1 reporter published : 13:37 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 9 july 2013 how does she do it ? homeless woman @entity4 , 50 , has a military base problem			1
she 's managed to enter @entity8 's @entity7 base four times since october and has at least one other previous arrest for trespassing on a base a homeless woman has managed to sneak into a heavily guarded @entity14 air force base four times since october and records show she ’s done it on other bases before			1
@entity19 was charged last month for trespassing in @entity8 ’s @entity20 for the fourth time where , in various ways , she ’s managed to live for up to days at time			1
last summer , the 50 - year - old was charged with entering @entity24 in @entity25			1
and , in 2007 , @entity26 was charged with two federal trespass counts near @entity28			1
this , according to a @entity30 roundup of the wannabe sergeant ’s sneaking around the past few years , this time onto a base even more locked down than many other posts			2
since september 11 , 2001 , security at @entity38 bases has been airtight			0
and @entity20 is an exception , if only because it takes its security even more seriously because it is home base for @entity43 and @entity44 – two high level subsets of the @entity38 military command			1
last month , @entity26 was charged on the four trespassing counts and for possessing a stolen military identification			1
the charges stem from incidents that began october 1 , 2012			2
that ’s when a retired @entity53 officer was heading to his boat , only to find it was already in use by the homeless woman			0
as it sat docked at the @entity20 marina , @entity26 was holding the boat ’s keys			0
the perplexed owner , @entity62 , likely was n’t any less confused after @entity26 ’s explanations			0
‘ @entity26 told him she was with @entity67 and had just come from the @entity68 , which she claimed had given her permission to board all of the boats , ’ reads @entity26 ’s arrest affidavit , dated june 26			2
@entity26 then leapt into the water and swam away			0
a six - hour search , involving local and base authorities as well as @entity75 and air units , ensued to no avail			2
but when a wet @entity26 was spotted at a base restaurant , she was cited and told to leave the base and not return			0
@entity80 : despite airtight security , @entity26 has been caught on @entity20 four times , even staying on it for days on end amphibious : during one @entity20 break - in , @entity26 was found in a retired officer 's boat at the base 's marina			1
she told him she was from the @entity68 and allowed to enter ' all the boats ' before leaping into the water and swimming away on november 18 , base personnel had a less dramatic , albeit equally , encounter with the slippery @entity26 , after she was discovered at the @entity20 fitness center			0
she tried to pass off a stolen @entity96 as her own and then showed base security how she ’d gotten into the base this second time			2
low tech : by dragging a trash can from a softball field ( pictured ) near the base 's walls , @entity26 said she was able to climb into @entity20 when she broke in the second			1
the homeless woman was warned again to leave and not come back homeless woman @entity4 has a knack for breaking into military bases			0
she 's made it into @entity8 's @entity110 four times , sometimes staying for days and despite airtight security , and has a history with at least one other base			1
2007 : @entity26 was arrested in @entity28 near @entity115			1
records for the exact nature of the federal trespassing charges are unavailable and were later dropped			1
august 2012 : @entity26 was arrested for trespassing in @entity25 's @entity24 base			1
she was found guilty and sentenced to time served			2
october 2012 : a retired officer at @entity20 found @entity26 on his boat in the base 's marina			2
she claimed she was ' with @entity67 ' and had permission to ' board all of the boats			0
' she then leapt in the water and swam away			0
a 6 - hour manhunt ensued			0
november 2012 : @entity26 was spotted in the base again and showed security how she 'd scaled a wall using a trash can			2
december 2012 : @entity26 was found on the base again , hiding behind a vehincle			0
' a brief foot chase ' ensued			0
january 2013 : the homeless woman was again caught inside the perimeter of the base and again showed security her knack at scaling @entity20 's walls			2
in spite of top - level security and trained military personnel numbering over 10,000 , @entity26 managed to get in simply by climbing a wall with a trash can she ’d pulled from a softball field that adjoins the base			1
@entity26 was again warned to go away and not to come back			0
strike three came on december 17 , when , according to the @entity30 , @entity26 was found hiding behind a parked car and nabbed ‘ after a brief foot chase			0
’ @entity20 officials would n’t comment monday , saying they were working together with federal authorities on the matter			0
so it is unclear how or why @entity26 was again released			0
but she got a fourth and , it seems , final chance , in january when she was found on the base yet again			0
according to the arrest affidavit : ‘ for about eight days she had been living inside a boat that was on a trailer parked in the base 's family @entity165			1
’ @entity26 said she ’d again scaled a wall to enter the base			0
@entity26 has yet to be arrested on the charges			0
but , amazingly , her history with stealing into military bases goes back even further , to 2007 when she was arrested near @entity28 ’s @entity115 base on federal trespassing charges			1
it is unclear if the charges , which were later dropped , stemmed from her actually entering @entity115			1
it is clear , though , that in august 2012 , @entity26 was arrested , charged , and found guilty of trespassing in @entity25 ’s @entity24 base			1
she was later sentenced to time served			2
old habits : @entity26 was caught on @entity25 's @entity24 ( pictured ) earlier in 2012			1
she was charged , convicted , and sentenced to time - served way back in 2007 , @entity26 was arrested near @entity28 's @entity115 and charged with trespassing			1
the charges were later dropped			2
though the current charges still stand , @entity26 has no attorney and has n't been arrested			0

@entity19 was charged with trespassing on the @entity8 , @entity14 base last month
at least once , the 50 - year - old got into the especially well - guarded home to @entity44 **--** which *overseas* operations throughout the @entity192 **--** by climbing atop a trash can
she previously served time for *illegally* entering @entity25 's @entity24 last august
charges were dropped after another 2007 trespassing arrest near @entity115 in @entity28
