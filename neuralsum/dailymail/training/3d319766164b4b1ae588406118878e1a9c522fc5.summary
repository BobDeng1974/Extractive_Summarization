by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:22 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:56 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 's parliament has passed a law that punishes ' aggrivated homosexuality ' with life imprisonment despite @entity9 opposition			1
first introduced in parliament in 2009 as a private member 's bill , the law initially proposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts in the conservative east @entity17 country			2
it was later amended to remove the death penalty , but includes jail terms for anyone convicted , including life imprisonment for what it defines as ' aggravated ' homosexual acts			1
@entity36 cut off aid to @entity4 late last year citing the bill as one of its concerns			2
widespread criticism of the law , and resistance from the executive which is wary of antagonising western donors , stalled its passage			0
but parliament has also been under pressure to push it through , especially from mainstream and evangelical churches			0
@entity53 was already illegal in @entity4 , but the new law prohibits the " promotion " of gay rights and punishes anyone who " funds " , " sponsors " or " abets " homosexuality			1
homosexuality is taboo in many @entity17 countries			0
it is illegal in 37 nations on the continent , and activists say few @entity17 are openly gay , fearing imprisonment , violence and losing their jobs			0
@entity72 , executive director of @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , said he would try to rally rights activists to have the law blocked in the courts			2
' we in the gay community are in a panic , ' he told @entity80			0
' people are afraid of walking in the streets , because they know how @entity4 like to take the law into their own hands			1
' the president must sign any bill passed in parliament before it becomes law			1
the deeply conservative nation has a long history of anti-gay campaigning , including this newspaper - unrelated to the @entity33 magazine - which printed the faces of men it claimed were gay ' clearly , president @entity30 should reject the bill and send a clear message that @entity4 does n't stand for this type of intolerance and discrimination , ' said @entity102 , senior @entity17 researcher at @entity103			1
' the removal of the death penalty is a good thing , but life imprisonment and a raft of other alarming provisions remain , many of which are wholly unenforceable			0
' international rights groups have criticized @entity4 for passing a series of laws they say have chipped away at civil liberties and created an oppressive environment			1
this week parliament passed an anti-pornography law that bans ' erotic behaviour intended to cause sexual excitement and any indecent act or behaviour tending to corrupt morals			2
' local media critics responded with derision , dubbing it the ' anti-miniskirt ' law because it prohibits wearing miniskirts			0
in august , @entity4 also passed a public order management law that requires anyone planning to hold a political rally or demonstration to give notice to the police			1
the legislation gives authorities sweeping powers to stop such meetings if they have ' reasonable grounds ' to do so .			0

@entity4 has passed legislation banning ' promotion ' of gay rights
the law punishes anyone who ' funds ' , ' sponsors ' or ' abets ' homosexuality
' @entity156 homosexuality ' carries life - long jail term
human rights groups have called on the president to drop the law
