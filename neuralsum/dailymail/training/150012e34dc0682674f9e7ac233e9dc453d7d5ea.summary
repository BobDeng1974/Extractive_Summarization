@entity1 forces have recaptured the city of @entity3 in a significant victory over @entity5 after more than two weeks of fighting			1
@entity3 is the largest city to be retaken by government troops since @entity5 - led militants overran much of @entity1 's @entity11 @entity10 heartland in june in their bid to create an @entity14 ' caliphate '			1
the recapture is also strategically important as @entity1 's largest oil refinery , capable of producing 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day , is located just outside of the city			1
although @entity5 still controls the oil refinery , the recapture of @entity3 further isolates militants farther south in the city of @entity33 , although @entity34 still controls large parts of @entity1 as well as swathes of @entity37			1

' soldiers , police , @entity46 militiamen and tribesmen were all involved in the operation to retake @entity3 , and are now pushing farther north			0
' ' @entity1 forces are on their way to the @entity3 refinery where security forces have held out against repeated jihadist attacks '			2
black gold : @entity3 is strategically important as @entity1 's largest oil refinery is located just outside of the city the @entity1 town of @entity3 is located near @entity1 's main oil refinery on the main highway to the @entity61 - controlled city of @entity27 an @entity1 soldier walks through @entity63 after regime forces retook the town from @entity5 militants last month breaking through to the massive refinery would be another significant win for the government in @entity25			1
but the victory was marred by a suicide bombing friday that targeted a military command headquarters set up at @entity74 , south of @entity3 , killing at least four people , army officers said			0
three suicide bombers and other militants had attacked the same headquarters in late october , disrupting the initial push into @entity3			0
@entity5 also claimed a truck bombing in @entity3 that killed a senior police officer last week			0
@entity1 troops initially struggled to regain ground from @entity34 after the start of the jihadist offensive			0
in control : armed trucks used by @entity5 can be seen taking up position near a market in central @entity27 , northern @entity1 , on thursday an @entity5 fighter is seen securing a street in central @entity27 , the day before @entity3 was recaptured by @entity1 with help from @entity95 - led air strikes , support from @entity46 militias and @entity11 tribesmen , assistance from international advisers , and a signficant reshuffling of top officers , @entity25 's forces have begun to make progress			1
the operation to retake @entity3 began more than four weeks ago when security forces and pro-government fighters started advancing towards the town from the south , slowed by bombs militants had planted on the way , and finally entered on october 31			0
the nearby @entity3 refinery once produced some 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day , meeting 50 per cent of the country 's needs , but even once it is recaptured , it would take time before it could resume production .			2

@entity1 has recaptured @entity3 , 130 miles north of @entity25 , from @entity5
@entity119 is @entity1 's main oil refinery , which is still under @entity5 control
