if you needed more proof that @entity2 has officially left the weedy teenager of @entity4 behind to become a bona - fide buff babe , you 've got it			1
pictured on the set of his latest film , @entity7 , @entity2 still managed to make us swoon despite wearing nothing but nude pants and a stuffed bumble bee			1
this got @entity13 thinking about how many child stars have grown into stunning adults , and how many have n't ... have n't you grown : we got a sneak peek at @entity2 's hot bod as well as his new film , @entity7 , on tuesday			1
he 's come along way since his @entity4 days ... it seems like only yesterday that @entity2 's baby blues peeped out at from beneath his sweeping fringe as he serenaded us in @entity4			1
but at the age of just 19 , and playing a 16 year old , it felt rather creepy having a schoolgirl crush on the young star			0
so now he 's 27 we are more than happy to be able to perve over his bulging biceps , hard six pack and toned legs ... at first , @entity2 appeared to be among the few male child stars who have blossomed as adults , with the girls ruling the ' i was cute and now i 'm hot ' world			1
the obvious exceptions are @entity36 - is there a hot list he is n't on ? - and @entity39			1
both were in the @entity41 , along with @entity42 and @entity43 , plus @entity36 starred as @entity44 in a tv series of the same name at the age of 18			0
always a handsome lad , @entity36 went from a blond ' young @entity44 ' to appearing on every hot list ever @entity39 has sorted his hair , got rid of those awful earrings and , how do we say this - grown into his face after digging a little deeper , however , we remembered @entity55 from @entity55 , aka @entity56 , whose dimples have dazzled for decades			1
also @entity58 who surprised us all when he grew from being the long - haired awkward boy in @entity60 into a suave - looking gent who knows how to work a suit			0
then there 's @entity65 , who has such a baby face we still consider him to be a youngster , but at the grand old age of 23 and with some manly facial hair , he 's now made it onto our list			2
@entity58 has grown from being the long - haired awkward boy into a suave - looking gent @entity55 from @entity55 , aka @entity56 , has dimples that have dazzled for decades @entity65 still has a baby face after all these years , but his new manly facial hair has got him on our list many cute - as - a - button boys , however , failed to grow into the hunks they could have been			1
@entity78 won our hearts as the mischievous young @entity80 in the @entity82 trilogy , but somehow evolved into a greasy guy who looks , well , a bit weird ... @entity85 was a heartthrob for youngsters brave enough to watch the second @entity88 film			2
he was awarded @entity89 and @entity90 for his part , and went on to appear in @entity92 and @entity93 , but his career took a dive due to multiple arrests , alcoholism and substance abuse			0

we still see that six - year - old cutie from @entity110 when we look at the now 40 - year - old @entity111			0
she definitely had a few dodgy years in the middle , but now she 's a boho babe that everybody loves			2
@entity115 , too , started acting at the age of six , playing @entity117 aged five in the eponymous tv series			0
we still see that six - year - old cutie from @entity110 when we look at the now 40 - year - old @entity111 @entity115 was the youngest ever nominee for a @entity119 when she was up for her role in @entity121 at age seven			0
she 's still flexing her acting talents at the age of 21 she was even the youngest ever nominee for a @entity119 when she was up for her role in @entity121 at age seven			2
now the 21 - year - old blonde bombshell is in anything and everything , from doing voice - overs to co-starring in the @entity131			0
talking of which , @entity132 was far from her mysterious , porcelain - skinned @entity135 character when she appeared aged 12 in @entity136 , alongside fellow former child star @entity137			0
@entity132 was far from her mysterious , porcelain - skinned @entity135 character when she appeared aged 12 in @entity136 sticking to the vampire theme , @entity139 , who plays @entity141 in @entity142 , won the 1993 @entity143 for @entity144 at the age of 11 for her role in @entity147			0
now lusted after by everyone from vampires to werewolves , there must be something in @entity139 's blood ... meanwhile , @entity154 must have waved his magic wand at @entity156 ( no that 's not a euphemism ) , as @entity159 grew from a pretty pixie into , well , a pretty pixie			1
but one with serious sass , style and sex appeal			0
@entity139 won an @entity143 at the age of just seven , but she 's more likely to win style awards today ... @entity159 has grown from a pretty pixie into , well , a pretty pixie			1
but one with style and sex appeal then of course there are the teeny boppers of the @entity174 , with the two big ones , @entity176 and @entity177 , showing exactly how to - and how not to - deal with fame at a young age			0
while @entity180 kept her image clean after rising to fame as a singer and actress in @entity185 - although admittedly we 're not 100 % sure on her green / grey hair just yet - @entity177 has caused controversy after controversy since her @entity190 days			0
she 's doing a great job of shirking her squeaky clean teen image , from twerking on stage to writhing around naked on a wrecking ball			1
as for the boys ? we 'll do the male species a favour by not taking a look at @entity199 ... @entity180 kept her image clean after rising to fame as a singer and actress in @entity185 - although admittedly we 're not 100 % sure on her green / grey hair just yet @entity177 has caused controversy ever since her @entity190 days			1
she 's doing a great job of shirking her squeaky clean teen image , from twerking on stage ( pictured ) to writhing around naked on a wrecking ball			2

@entity2 's buff bod is far from the weedy teen days of @entity4
@entity13 looks at more famous tots and teens all grown up and looking hot
cute kids do n't *guarantee* cute adults , though , as we find out ...
