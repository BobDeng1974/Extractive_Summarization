police are set to investigate a video which showed a teenage wakeboarding champion being dragged along a waterway by a Â£ 1million @entity4 at ' more than 80mph '			1
daredevil @entity5 , 19 , got onto a wakeboard on the @entity7 north of @entity8 , @entity9 and was dragged along by a bright yellow @entity10			1
but the reported speed of the car could prompt a police investigation into the stunt - which took place on a country lane which has a speed limit of 60mph			1
the driver of the @entity4 - a mid- 90s sports car with a top speed of 200mph which is regarded as ' a road - legal racing car ' - then accelerates down the country lane next to the ditch as mr @entity5 holds on			1
mr @entity5 , a two - time @entity39 wakeboarding champion , hurtled along the river as the @entity4 hit what was claimed to be speeds of 84mph			1
the film was shot by @entity44 , a group of fast car enthusiasts known for making shocking videos			2
in the past they have thrashed a @entity49 around a country estate and took a @entity52 rallying			2
mr @entity5 , from @entity53 , became an internet sensation earlier this year when he wakeboarded through a flooded car park in @entity56			2
the video posted on @entity58 shows mr @entity5 tie a cord to the spoiler of the @entity4 before jumping into the flooded ditch he then holds on as the sports car drives along the neighbouring road , pulling him along at high speeds the video shows him holding on for a distance of around 100metres as the car drives along the country road before he collapses into the river the adrenaline junkie , who is also a five - time national champion , said he had the idea for the stunt while travelling			1
boasting about the video , he said : ' i was on a mini-bus in @entity75 when the idea came to me as a supercar flew past the bus and next to it was a river			0
' the idea clicked , combining a supercar with wakeboarding seemed very unique to me			0
' i was a little nervous beforehand			0
normally i do around 20mph but for this i was going a lot faster			0
we had a few warm ups at lower speed and it was a bit scary when you hear the @entity4 's engine			0
' it is dangerous , but you have to forget about the dangerous side until afterwards			0
' a spokesman for @entity96 said : ' the footage showing the wakeboarder and the @entity4 has been brought to the attention of @entity96			0
' we will examine it to establish if any offences have been committed			0
it appears that there may be issues concerning excessive speed and the manner in which the car was driven			2
' it is said the car reached speeds of more than 80mph on the 60mph - limit stretch of road , prompting a possible police investigation the video shows mr @entity5 jumping back into the car after the stunt and is heard telling the driver : ' that was fast '			1

@entity120 posted *online* shows wakeboarder being dragged by @entity10
wakeboarding champion *surfed* along ditch ' at speeds of up to 84mph '
he eventually collapsed into the water and is heard saying : ' that was fast '
the speed of the car - on a 60mph country lane - could prompt police probe
