renewing a push for paid leave for workers , president @entity2 on thursday will call on @entity6 , states and cities to pass measures to allow millions of workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year			1
he 'll also ask @entity6 for more than $ 2 billion in new spending to encourage states to create paid family and medical leave programs , the @entity9 says			1
in addition , @entity2 will use executive discretion to give federal employees – men and women alike – up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child			1
president @entity2 will call on @entity6 , states and cities today to pass measures to allow millions of workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year ' the fact is this is not a partisan issue			1
it ’s a family issue , and it ’s an economic issue , senior adviser @entity31 , said			0
' adopting policies that are good for working families is both good for business and good for workers			0
' more than 40 million @entity37 private sector workers do n't have any type of paid sick leave , @entity40 said , ' not a single day			2
' that means they lose pay if they stay home when sick or to care for someone who is			0
the @entity9 confirmed thursday night that @entity2 's policy proposal dealing with paid time off for new parents will apply to men as well as women			1
a @entity9 fact sheet on the policy proposal argues that ' many workers will go to work sick , putting their coworkers and customers at risk of illness			1
and even if workers have access to paid sick leave for themselves , they may not be able to use it to care for sick children			2
' this forces many parents to choose between taking an unpaid day off work — losing much needed income and potentially threatening his or her job — and sending a child who should be home in bed to school , ' the @entity9 said			2
the president 's spokesman said today that the policy is both family - friendly and business - friendly because going to work sick with an illness like the flu will ' only serve to spread the flu to your fellow coworkers			2
that is bad for businesses because they have a whole slew of employees out sick , he said			0
details on how @entity2 would raise the $ 2 billion to help states will be released in the president 's budget proposal next month , @entity40 said wednesday			1
@entity2 wants @entity6 to pass legislation that has been sponsored since 2005 by @entity95 rep. @entity94 to allow workers to earn up to seven days , or 56 hours , of paid sick leave to care for themselves or a sick family member , obtain preventive care or deal with domestic violence			1
under the @entity102 , workers would earn an hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours they work			0
employers that already provide paid sick time would not have to change their policies as long as the time earned can be used for the same purposes			0
@entity2 will call on states and cities to adopt similar legislation			2
some already have , as the @entity9 noted in a fact sheet			0
the president will also outline ways to broaden access to paid family and medical leave			1
under the 1993 federal @entity120 , workers may take up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off without losing their job to care for a new child , recover from an illness or care for an ill family member			2
the @entity9 says most families can not afford such long stretches of time off without pay			0
' we ca n't say we stand for family values when so many women in this country have to jeopardize their financial security just to take a few weeks off of work after giving birth , ' @entity40 said in a @entity139 post previewing the initiative on wednesday			0
three states — @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 – offer paid family and medical leave			1
to encourage others to follow , @entity2 will propose $ 2.2 billion in new spending to reimburse up to five states for three years for the actual and administrative costs associated with implementing similar programs			1
the @entity9 says @entity2 's budget will also include a request for $ 35 million to be put toward competitive grants for states working toward implementing paid leave programs			1
additionally , the @entity158 will spend $ 1 million in funds it already has to help states and localities conduct studies to determine the ramifications of paid family leave policies			1
president @entity2 returns by night to the @entity9 after a day trip to @entity23			2
@entity2 has been travelling across the country , giving near - daily previews of initiatives geared toward the middle class and working families that he plans to highlight in next tuesday 's nationally televised @entity173 address with regard to the federal workforce , @entity2 will propose legislation providing six weeks of paid administrative leave for the birth , adoption or foster placement of a child			1
federal workers receive paid sick leave and vacation time , but no paid time off specifically for family or parental leave			1
under the proposal , federal workers could use sick time to care for a healthy child after birth or adoption			2
@entity2 also planned to direct federal agencies to advance six weeks of paid sick leave that federal workers could use as paid family leave , something agencies can do if they decide to , said @entity2 economic adviser @entity198			1
workers would be required to pay back the sick leave over time			0
@entity203 sen. @entity202 , chairman of the @entity205 's labor committee , said @entity2 's proposed measures would set back workers and make it more difficult for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses			1
' @entity37 have great freedom when it comes to work — they can choose the career they like and negotiate with their employer for the things they need , and they can one day become employers , opening businesses with few restrictions compared to the rest of the world , ' the @entity211 senator said			0
' one more government mandate , however well - intentioned , will only reduce those freedoms — making it harder for employees to find jobs , negotiate for the things they need , and open and run businesses			0
@entity202 said the federal government ' should do what it can to encourage employers to offer paid sick leave ' but should ' not impose a big new mandate ' that he claims will ' cost employers $ 11.4 billion over five years and make it harder for them to hire new employees			1
' sen. @entity236 , a @entity211 from @entity237 , said employers should provide paid sick leave on a ' voluntary ' basis			2
she and @entity242 sen. @entity241 , an @entity243 senator , have introduced legislation that would ' encourage ' businesses to do just that by giving organizations that offer their employees at least four weeks of paid leave a tax credit			1
meanwhile , @entity94 and women 's groups applauded the president 's announcement			0
' workplaces need to respond to the reality of family life in the 21st century , and allowing employees to have seven sick days a year is a bare minimum , ' @entity94 said			0
' the fact that the @entity37 is one of just a handful of countries that does not require paid family or sick leave is nothing short of shameful			2
' the chances that lawmakers will send @entity94 's bill to @entity2 in the next two years appear slim to none , given that the congresswoman first introduced the bill a decade ago			0
but @entity272 , president of the @entity273 , said the announcement amounts to the ' boldest action ' in support of family - friendly workplace polices in a generation			0
' this is fantastic news for workers , families and our economy , ' she said			0
@entity2 's actions follow up on a @entity285 the president held last june in @entity287 , @entity40 said			0
it is also the latest in a series of near - daily previews by @entity2 of initiatives geared toward the middle class and working families that he plans to highlight in next tuesday 's nationally televised @entity173 address			0
the @entity9 said thursday it would use the @entity173 to try to drum up support for the measure .			0
