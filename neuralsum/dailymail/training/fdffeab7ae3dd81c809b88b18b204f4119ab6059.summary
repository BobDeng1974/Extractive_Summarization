convicted killer @entity0 broke down in tears and clutched his young bride 's hand , pleading : ' help me , please help me			1
' the once - swaggering @entity5 recently went on a hunger strike after he was moved from a relaxed jail to one of the most notorious prisons in @entity10			1
he claims it is ' worse than @entity12 ' and that he and other inmates are beaten			2
and in an interview with @entity16 his pregnant wife , @entity14 , 25 , said he is close to the breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions			1

' after her last visit three weeks ago , @entity0 handed @entity14 a scrawled letter and asked her to sneak it out of the prison and hand it to the @entity61			1
the letter , written in @entity63 , is a cry for help asking the @entity63 authorities to intervene and remove him from the ' inhumane ' conditions at the prison			2
the handwriting is scruffy and disjointed – different to the neat love letters he would write to @entity14 from his last jail			1
it reads : ' help please			2
i am not allowed to have pen or paper , nothing			0
there is no light , nothing ... no pen and paper , help please			0
