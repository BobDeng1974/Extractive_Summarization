i felt as if my soul had been wrenched from my body			0
there was no one in my world			0
‘ i was frightened , paranoid , and felt physically and mentally wrapped in a dense blanket of fog			0
‘ i ’ve worked in war zones , but i ’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as i was when i was in the mri scanner after taking skunk			1
i would never do it again			0
’ his comments come as a study published by the @entity48 medical journal this week found that the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of skunk cannabis than for non-users			1

writing on his @entity18 blog , mr @entity7 said : ‘ by the time i was completely stoned i felt utterly bereft			1
i felt as if my soul had been wrenched from my body ' mr @entity7 , who admitted to having been passed the ‘ odd spliff of cannabis ’ a dozen times in the past , said last night that smoking the much stronger skunk ‘ outstripped anything ’ he had previously experienced			1
@entity65 is thought to account for around for 80 per cent of the @entity67 drug market and is believed to be more addictive than normal herbal cannabis or its solid form , hash			2
a study published by the @entity48 medical journal this week found that the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of skunk cannabis than for non-users			1
professor @entity76 , a @entity77 neurologist who organised the trial , said : ‘ this is a hugely exciting and important research project which will show how skunk and hash can produce different effects on the human brain , mind and behaviour			1
‘ my research group were concerned that cannabis addiction in the @entity67 has increased over recent years alongside the increased market dominance of skunk			2
‘ i hope this new programme will scientifically inform those who use , have used or are thinking of using this drug about the diverse effects of different types of cannabis			1

it was just horrible , i felt stoned and stupid			0

' the cannabis heightened and intensified ; it did not create			0
' during the six - month trial , on three separate occasions the volunteers took controlled doses of different forms of medicinal cannabis as well as a placebo under laboratory conditions at @entity77			0
