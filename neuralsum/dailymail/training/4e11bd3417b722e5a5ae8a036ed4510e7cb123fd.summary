it comes as the bigger screen on @entity5 's new @entity23 has been linked with luring customers away from the previously bigger @entity14 phone the @entity27 electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand on the popularity of earlier @entity14 models			1
but the bigger screen on @entity5 's new @entity23 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger @entity14 range			1

other rumoured specifications include a @entity72 front - facing camera , and camera on the rear that could range between @entity75 and @entity76			0
that was below the median of analysts ' expectations of £ 3 billion ( $ 4.9 billion ) , according to @entity81 , a financial data provider			0
if it happens , this would reflect a 60 per cent plunge from the record - high £ 6 billion ( $ 9.5 billion )			1

the @entity124 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset , with some calling it a ' superphone ' the company needs to revamp its handset designs , said @entity133 , an analyst at @entity134			0
