for ten years the twin rovers , @entity1 , have been sending back stunning pictures as they explore the surface of @entity4			1
the rovers have taken hundreds of thousands of images as they journeyed round the red planet , many of which have led to scientific discoveries			2
a selection of the images , showing sweeping deserts , dusty craters and strange rock formations , have been selected for an exhibition celebrating the mission			1
the rover 's panoramic camera ( @entity25 ) took the images during the interval jan. 3 , 2014 , to jan. 6 , 2014 tiny spherules , also known as blueberries because of their hue when photographed , are seen on a sandy surface on @entity4 a full - scale model of the @entity1 , which landed in 2004 , is displayed ' the idea we had for the exhibit was to show the beauty of @entity4 and at the same time tell the story of the mission and the discoveries , ' @entity33 , a @entity34 supervisory geologist , told @entity42			2
fifty images will make up the @entity44 : 10 years roving across @entity4 exhibit , which can be seen at the @entity34 until september 14			1
the images sent back on the missions , to two distinct parts of the planet , showed a mix of gorgeous landscapes and desolate scenes that helped scientists learn more about the history of the planet			0
' we know that @entity4 was a very different place in its early history			0
there 's evidence it was a much warmer and wetter environment , ' mr @entity33 said			0
' that 's not to say there was life there , but it says conditions might have been conducive to it			0
' a long shadow of @entity69 is cast over the surface of @entity4 , near the edge of @entity72 , in the late afternoon sunlight this groundbreaking image was one of the first to show sulfate - rich outcrops with broken spherule on the @entity78 ripples on the surface of @entity4 appear like shifting sand dunes the @entity82 dune field dominates this view sent by @entity84 after several days of exploring a sunset captured by @entity44 over the rim of the @entity88 crater looks like a scene from @entity90 colors on this image taken by @entity44 from @entity93 show the difference in rock weathering tracks from @entity97 disappear into the horizon in the desolate stretch between the @entity72 and @entity101 craters this section of the planet 's surface , peppered with loose hematite - rich spherules , looks like a blueberry muffin an exhibition celebrating ten years of exploring @entity4 can be seen at the @entity34			1

today marks the anniversary of the twin @entity4 rovers , spirit and opportunity
images reveal sweeping deserts , dusty craters and strange rock formations
the pictures are part of the @entity44 : 10 years roving across @entity4 exhibit , which can be seen at the @entity34 until september 14
