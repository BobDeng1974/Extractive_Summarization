it 's football 's favourite wet blanket			0
no matter how breath - taking the accomplishment , there will always be some cynic who queries , half - seriously , whether they could have done it on a wet midweek in @entity9			0
' @entity10 has just scored a wonderful hat - trick in the @entity12 ! ' ' yeah great , but i bet he could n't do it on a windy , wintry night at the @entity15			2
' it is a real compliment to @entity9 that a visit there is regarded so difficult it has become the subject of a million pub retorts			2
@entity9 are notoriously difficult to beat at the @entity15 - @entity22 are their next visitors @entity24 takes his table - topping blues to @entity9 on monday night in the @entity26 @entity27 scores for @entity9 in their 3 - 2 win over @entity29 at the beginning of the month @entity22 @entity31 6 w 3 d 2 l 1 f 11 a 5 @entity29 @entity31 7 w 1 d 2 l 4 f 8 a 11 @entity32 @entity31 6 w 0 d 5 l 1 f 4 a 5 @entity33 @entity31 6 w 4 d 1 l 1 f 9 a 4 @entity34 @entity31 6 w 1 d 2 l 3 f 7 a 10 * @entity26 matches only but , as @entity22 prepare to make the trip to the @entity36 on monday night , is playing @entity9 in their own backyard really that daunting for the @entity26 elite ? well , it depends who you are			1
while @entity29 , @entity34 and @entity32 have found the place a graveyard in recent years , @entity22 and @entity33 seem to thrive there			1
indeed , the @entity47 ' 3 - 2 reverse there last season is their only loss at the @entity15 since @entity9 came into the @entity26 in 2008			1
@entity22 have won three and drawn two of their trips there , the most memorable being a 4 - 0 thrashing in january 2013 built on two own goals by @entity57			2
@entity24 s still chasing his first win on the ground but with @entity22 in imperious form , they will start as strong favourtes on monday night			1
@entity62 celebrates scoring for @entity22 at @entity9 during their 4 - 0 win in january last year @entity57 ( left ) scored two own goals as @entity22 ran out easy winners at the @entity15 last year @entity66 fall theatrically to the ground after failing to turn home a cross in august 2011 @entity31 6 w 4 d 1 l 1 f 9 a 4 @entity33 also slipped up there last season , losing 2 - 1 , but were unbeaten under sir @entity72 's leadership			1
they twice won by a single - goal margin and twice by a two - goal margin , with the meeting in september 2011 ending in a 1 - 1 draw			0
by contrast , the prospect of a visit to @entity9 strikes fear into the hearts of @entity29 fans - and @entity83			1
@entity84 ( left ) leads the celebrations after scoring in @entity9 's 2 - 1 win over @entity33 last season @entity87 hugs sir @entity72 after scoring at the @entity15 in april 2013 @entity88 rises above the @entity33 defence to head home an equaliser in a 1 - 1 draw back in september 2011 @entity31 7 w 1 d 2 l 4 f 8 a 11 the @entity93 have won just once in seven visits there , losing on four occasions , and the trip inevitably ends in injuries , accusations of being soft and @entity83 moaning about @entity9 's bully - boy tactics			1
they have already made the trip this season , back at the beginning of the month , and went down 3 - 2 , with @entity88 scoring after 19 seconds and @entity104 seeing red			0
a @entity57 penalty did for them last season and he rounded off a 3 - 1 win for @entity9 back in may 2011			2
back in november 2008 , @entity87 was sent off in a 2 - 1 loss , sealed by a @entity110 goal			0
@entity29 's @entity111 trudges off after their 1 - 0 loss at @entity9 last season @entity57 celebrates with @entity88 after scoring the decisive penalty in that fixture last season @entity83 looks exasperated as he talks to @entity115 during a @entity15 match in august 2012 @entity31 6 w 1 d 2 l 3 f 7 a 10 @entity34 , too , have suffered on their visits to @entity9			1
their 5 - 3 win last season is their only win in six			0
@entity57 , who seems to thrive against the big teams , scored twice in a 3 - 1 win back on @entity123 and his penalty saw off the @entity125 in september 2011			1
@entity126 and @entity127 were on target to settle the contest a year earlier			0
@entity131 wheels away in celebration after scoring in @entity34 's 5 - 3 win at @entity9 last season @entity134 ( left ) , @entity135 ( middle ) and @entity84 walk off dejected after a 1 - 0 loss in september 2011 @entity66 rues a missed opportunity during a goalless draw at @entity9 in august 2009 @entity31 6 w 0 d 5 l 1 f 4 a 5 it 's not a happy hunting ground for @entity32 either , who have not won at the @entity15 since @entity9 were promoted into the @entity26			1
five of their six meetings have ended all - square , while @entity146 's goal proved the winner for 10 - man @entity9 back in january 2009			0
even in their title - winning campaigns , @entity9 have been incapable of winning at @entity9			0
it finished 0 - 0 last season and ended 1 - 1 back in march 2012 , when @entity152 cancelled out a @entity88 opener			0
so , there is certainly plenty of evidence to suggest there is truth in the ' wet night in @entity9 ' put - down but some teams seem to have cracked the code			2
@entity88 celebrates giving @entity9 the lead against @entity32 in march 2012			2
the game ended 1 - 1 @entity164 heads in @entity9 's second goal in a 3 - 1 win over @entity32 in february 2010 @entity22 owner @entity167 will definitely not be at the @entity15 on monday night			1

@entity22 's @entity173 owner @entity167 with girlfriend @entity171 on the island of @entity170 @entity167 's enormous yacht arrives at the @entity169 island ahead of @entity179 celebrations			0

@entity22 travel to @entity9 in @entity26 on monday night

@entity34 's win last season was their first in six attempts
@entity22 and @entity33 have fairly good records but lost last year
