icon of the 1970s : the original designs for the @entity6 have come to light 45 years after bicycle was first made			2
the scribbled sketches were just basic outlines but they clearly show its most famous features - large @entity13 handlebars and rear wheel and long leather seats the chopper was based on dragster cars and bikes of the 1960s and was a signifier of a child 's coolness in the 1970s			1
@entity31 produced the concept art for @entity34 's design department headed by @entity35 including details such as the padded leather seat and distinctive wheels			1
the first chopper went into production in 1969 and became a cultural icon of the 1970s			1
the first version of the bike featured a gear hub selected using a frame - mounted lever			0
it had an unusually - shaped frame , high back seat and ape hanger handlebars as well as differently sized wheels which were 16inches ( 41cm ) at the front and 20inches ( 51cm ) at the back			0
the design cost £ 32 for the most basic version at the time			0
the @entity56 was produced from 1972 until the end of production and had a seat that was moved forward to prevent the bike tipping up as well as other tweaks			2
around one and a half million bikes were sold before the @entity65 craze of the 1980s took over			0
this was despite the bicycle being unstable , slow , heavy and trickier to ride than conventional bikes			0
a lighter @entity69 was launched in 2004 made of aluminium with various safety features			0
they were drawn by inventor @entity73 and evolved into formal designs for @entity34 , which produced the first @entity75 in 1969			1
the bikes , which emulated dragsters , soon became the must - have toy for children across @entity80 and more than 1.5million of them were made until production ceased in 1979			1
mr @entity73 , 87 has kept the two pages of original drawings , which he took with him when he retired from @entity31 , the consultancy firm used by @entity34 , in 1999			1
since then his sketch books have been left gathering dust in the garage of his home in @entity89 , but the grandfather recently rediscovered them ‘ the sketch books were just for me to do some rough doodles for me to pass on my ideas to the designers to work on and show to the client , ’ he said			0
‘ i left @entity31 in 1999 and took these books with me			2
i have had them in my garage ever since			0
they were with a pile of things that i just saved			0
’ he was managing director of the company between 1962 and 1999 , and in 1968 his company was approached by @entity80 firm @entity34 bicycles help them come up with a design to rival one of the leading bikes on the market made by @entity111			1
the chopper bikes emulated dragster bikes , soon became the must - have toy for children across @entity80 and more than 1.5million of them were made until production ceased in 1979 creative : the sketches ( pictured ) were drawn by inventor @entity73 and evolved into formal designs for @entity34 , which produced the first @entity75 in 1969 they had tried to compete against the cycle with their rodeo model , but were unsuccessful			1
mr @entity73 took inspiration from the dragster cars which have two large wheels at the back and sketched a picture in a matter of minutes that went on to became the chopper			1
however , @entity34 's head of design			2
@entity35 claimed to have drawn the very first design for the chopper on the back of an envelope in 1967 , while he flew back from the @entity137 from a trip designed to get to grips with youth culture , @entity132 reported			2
he saw teenagers in @entity142 customising push bikes to look like dragster motorcycles used by the @entity145 by adopting ' ape hanger ' handlebars and other features			2
mr @entity73 , 87 , ( pictured in his study ) has kept the two pages of original drawings , which he took with him when he retired from @entity31 , the consultancy firm used by @entity34 , in 1999 as well as the famous features of the bike , mr @entity73 said he had the idea to put in gears and springs under the seat			1
certain parts were prototyped and eventually the designs were passed to @entity34			2
mr @entity73 said : ‘ in the 1960s there was a bike made by a company called @entity111			1
mr @entity73 ( pictured ) took inspiration from the dragster cars and sketched a picture in a matter of minutes that went on to became the @entity6 ‘ it was very sturdy and was great for kids because they could just throw it down on the pavement and then pick it up again and ride away			1
‘ @entity34 decided to make a bike to rival the @entity111 and designed something rather like it , which they called the @entity176			1
’ he explained that @entity34 wanted to reach the same market but to have a ‘ different flavour , so i decided there and then that it must have a big wheel at the back and a small one at the front			0
’ the reason for that was because dragster cars had big wheels at the back where the power was , and i wanted it to have that feel			1
i made a quick sketch within a few minutes in my sketch book			0
’ the chopper bike had similar handlebars to the @entity111			1
‘ it had a straight frame , a gear shift that kids loved to use to change speed , and the rear wheel had some pretend disk brakes , ’ mr @entity73 said			0
‘ there was a concern that the saddle was too similar to the @entity111 so we redesigned it and put springs underneath it			0
‘ we then delivered the final designs to @entity34 and it became a considerable success and made a lot of money for them			2
it was quite iconic and still is today			0
’ @entity34 made two versions of the bike - the @entity216 from 1969 to 1972 and then the @entity217 from 1972 to 1979			1
they also produced a number of limited edition bikes			0
mr @entity73 was approached by @entity80 firm @entity34 bicycles to help them come up with a design to rival one of the leading bikes on the market made by @entity111 ( pictured at a flea market in @entity229 ) mr @entity73 , riding on his chopper bike ( pictured ) said : ' we delivered the final designs to @entity34 and it became a considerable success and made a lot of money for them			1
