by @entity0 last updated at 8:02 am on 26th september 2011 ' poor reception ' : @entity2 felled 11 of his neighbour 's trees and damaged another 21 a fuming neighbour was so annoyed about the poor signal his television was receiving that he cut down the trees he thought were responsible for it			1
@entity2 felled 11 of his neighbour 's trees and damaged another 21 near his house because he thought they were interfering with his channel reception			1
the 30 - foot high @entity15 pine trees he cut down were growing on agricultural land backing on to his home and he has now been ordered by a court to pay the landowner £ 2,500 in compensation			1
however this figure could rise again if civil action is taken against 55 - year - old @entity2 to recoup more of the £ 17,000 of damage he caused to the trees			1
@entity2 was also given 80 hours community service at @entity27			2
the court heard that @entity2 had been warned several times in the past to stop cutting back the trees - which he ignored - and was even personally asked by the landowner @entity32 , whose farm backs on to @entity2 's house			1
mr @entity32 , a seventh - generation arable farmer in @entity35 , @entity36 , said after the hearing that it will take between 15 and 20 years to repair the damage caused to the belt of mature trees			1
he also suggested he might pursue a civil claim against @entity2			2
he said : ' the compensation covers some of the damage but not the loss of amenity			2
we will have to go back to our lawyers and see if it is worth chasing			0
' we would like to get on and replant this autumn so the screen has a chance of growing back as quickly as possible			0
' destroyed : the 30 - foot high @entity15 pine trees were growing on agricultural land backing on to @entity2 's home			1

despite the court hearing how the total damage was more than £ 17,500 , @entity2 , who used to be a hgv driver , was only ordered to pay £ 2,500 and given the community sentence , as he is out - of - work and has no assets			1
judge @entity67 said : ' that may still happen to you			0
you had no right to do what you did			0
' the judge also told him he should not have denied the criminal damage charge , adding : ' it was a great pity you chose to defend this action			0
you had absolutely no defence and no business to cut down the trees			0
' @entity2 made no comment after the case			2
mr @entity32 said he had noticed branches on his belt of mature trees were gradually being cut down , but he had no idea who it was until he spotted @entity88 in 2009			1
he also said he believed @entity2 's motives were to create a view from his property			2
he told the @entity92 : ' he made some lame excuse that he needed to improve his television reception			0
' the fact was he was clearing the branches from the ground up to about 25ft , which was really , i think , so that he could get a view out to the west			0
' mr @entity32 , who is also vice-chairman of the @entity102 , said he hoped the case would serve as a warning to he added : ' if he had stopped the first time or even the second time i asked , we would n't have asked for a prosecution to take place			0
