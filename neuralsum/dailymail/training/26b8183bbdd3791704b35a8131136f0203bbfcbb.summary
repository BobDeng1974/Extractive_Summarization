having grown up in the public eye , i ’ve probably developed a thicker skin than most			0
a little over a year ago , however , i was photographed at the beach - already an annually scarring ordeal - and some less than flattering bikini photos started appearing online			1
i felt pretty terrible about myself , and promptly embarked on a diet rampage			0
i juiced , i did @entity7 , i ate only vegetables , i hired a personal trainer and took up @entity11 yoga ; even tried laser liposuction			0
then , in january of last year , i made a discovery that changed my life			1
i got myself tested for food allergies and spent the next ten months re-adjusting my diet to cut out my ( rather random - seeming ) triggers - dairy , yeast , tuna , pecans and celery			1
after numerous fad diets , an allergy test triumphed and she lost ten pounds ( right , now ) i did n’t lose an enormous amount of weight - dropping from 170lbs to 160lbs over a year - but my body shape changed drastically			1
my belly , love handles and butt diminished , my skin cleared up and my energy levels soared			0
i was first introduced to this concept while on a health retreat at the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			0
i was at the tail - end of my three month fad - dieting blitz and i was of the opinion - having been raised in @entity49 - that anyone could lose weight if they juiced for long enough			1
still , for whatever reason , that just was n’t what my body wanted			1
before and after : @entity26 , pictured in 2013 ( left ) and now ( right ) , discovered she had minor to moderate allergies to a number of foods which was making it hard for her to lose weight i was skeptical at first when the team at @entity42 tested my blood and urine for allergies			1
i had never appeared to suffer any as a child ; no puffy face from peanuts or angry reactions to strawberries			0
i do , however , get eczema from time to time , and this was cause enough for the nutritionist to suggest i get tested			0
low and behold , that small red rash that i had always ignored turned out to be the result of a whole host of food allergies			0
allergens are rated on a scale from one to five , five being the most severe			2
at a five , you ’ll see physical reactions such as hives , throat swelling and face numbness			0
at a ‘ one ’ or a ‘ two ’ you might see , to a varying degree , gas or excess body weight			2
on this scale , i was rated a ‘ one ’ for celery , a ‘ two ’ for tuna and pecans , and a ‘ three ’ for yeast and dairy			1
transformation : after cutting out her allergens completely but never denying herself of other foods , @entity26 noticed the shape of body change dramatically lifestyle shift : @entity26 , pictured ( left ) in may 2011 and ( right ) in december 2014 , was initially skeptical about getting tested for allergies but has since admitted it changed her life i was advised to cut out all my allergens completely for a period of time - i went for ten months - to see how i how i did			1
food allergens are rated on a scale from one to five , five being the most severe at the lower end , reactions can trigger excess gas , irritability and weight gain at the higher end , symptoms include hives , throat swelling and numbness combining different allergens on the scale can cause a more severe reaction than consuming them alone cutting out all allergens for a period of time can result in weight loss and better health simply experimenting by eliminating common allergens - including yeast and dairy - might enable you to avoid costly testing there is a science to allergens and a reason i had n’t noticed them before			1
because i only have allergies at levels ‘ three ’ and below , i do n’t experience the physical symptoms typical of a more severe reaction			0
but i was gaining weight because of them			0
and while consumed solo these effects are less , when i combine allergens i do react			2
if i eat a ‘ two ’ and a ‘ three ’ together - tuna with cheese for example - i will break out in a rash or get tired and irritable			1
it ’s a new numbers game i had to learn to play			0
at first , i felt like i had nothing to eat			0
my world went from cuisine to plain chicken and veggies , excluding celery			2
i had n’t realized how much of my diet contained dairy and yeast			1
still , i was on board and disciplined , and i learned as i went along			0
i was never once hungry , just eating different sorts of foods			2
stayed active : @entity26 , pictured in 2013 ( left ) and now ( right ) never changed her exercise regime , which involves hiking and going the gym , but after she cut out her allergens , she started seeing real results within the first two months , i had lost around ten pounds			1
this may not have been ‘ fat ’ per se			0
call it toxins , water weight or extra lovin ’ - whatever it was , it left my body			1
i did n’t lose any more weight but i kept the ten pounds off and what surprised me most what the changing shape of my figure			1
my goal after that changed			0
i no longer wanted to lose weight , i wanted to hone my natural figure			0
i ’ve never been a gym freak , but i stay active , and the amount of exercise i was doing had n’t changed - it was just having a different effect			2
i hike with my dogs a few times a week for an hour and i hit the gym when i can to walk and jog on the treadmill or lift light weights			0
but unlike before , i ’m no longer feeding my body with foods that are toxic to it , so i ’ve finally been seeing real results from my workouts			1
model : @entity26 has launched two clothing lines - pictured , her @entity197 collection for @entity26 x @entity200 - and makes it a policy never to have her photos photoshopped family : @entity26 ( left ) pictured with her mother , ex-playboy playmate @entity207 ( center left ) , her father , @entity210 legend @entity209 ( center right ) and her brother @entity212 ( right ) a year later , i ’m slowing reintroducing some of my lower scale allergens , like celery , back into my diet			1
i do n’t think i will ever fully embrace dairy or yeast again			1
on every occasion i ’ve slipped up on that - my belly has bloated			2
and there are so many other food options that keep my body happy			2
if i ’ve learned anything about my body over the last year , it ’s that we all respond to food and exercise differently			1
we ca n’t expect juicing and sweating it out at spin class to be a blanket fix - all			2
if you do n’t want to shell out for the allergy test , which i admit can be expensive , then try cutting out dairy and yeast - which are very common triggers - to start , and see how you feel			1
it ’s all about giving your body the best tools to succeed			2
i ’ve launched two clothing lines in the last few months which i modeled myself , and far from being horrified by paparazzi photos of my derriere , these days i make it a policy to never have my images re-touched or photoshopped			0
i ’m proud of my bikini body now			0
i ’ve got curves in all the right places , and most importantly of all : i ’m healthy , not hungry .			0
