speaking out : leading fertility doctor professor @entity1 @entity3 's plans for a mansion tax are like something out of ‘ @entity6 ’ , one of the party ’s own peers declared last night			1
leading fertility doctor professor @entity1 said the policy was unfair because it would not affect people in similar - sized properties in other cities in the @entity14			1
the @entity16 pioneer warned the plan , which levies an annual tax worth thousands of pounds on homes worth more than £ 2million , could result in homeowners being forced to move out – a prospect he compared to the @entity22 inflicted on @entity6 after the revolution			1
asked about the tax in a radio interview , the 74 - year - old said he joined the @entity27 ‘ because i believed @entity27 was after fairness ’			1
lord @entity1 , who also found fame for presenting @entity31 documentaries such as @entity32 and the @entity34 series and lives in a terraced property in @entity36 , one of the most affluent parts of @entity39 , added : ‘ my terraced house in @entity39 is probably just close to that band			2
if i had the same identical house on the outskirts of @entity46 , it would be half that amount and i would never pay this kind of tax			0
that does n’t seem right to me			0
’ asked if he could just move somewhere smaller to avoid the tax , he replied : ‘ if you ’ve lived in a house for 30 or 40 years i ’m not sure government should be forcing you to move out			0
that then becomes something that last really happened in the @entity57 after the revolution			0
’ the @entity27 policy has already been criticised by several of the party ’s own leading candidates to be mayor of @entity39 , including @entity63 , dame @entity64 and @entity65 , while last week @entity66 said it was ‘ crude ’			2
@entity3 's plans for a mansion tax are like something out of ‘ @entity6 ’ , one of the party ’s own peers declared last night the party has said homes worth between £ 2million and £ 3million will pay £ 3,000 a year , but shadow chancellor @entity76 refused to give details on the levy which would be paid on properties over £ 3million			0
a @entity27 spokesman said the tax ‘ would apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the @entity14 ’s homes ’ , adding : ‘ when working people have seen their wages fall by £ 1,600 a year since 2010 it is right to ask those who have the most to make a bigger contribution			2
