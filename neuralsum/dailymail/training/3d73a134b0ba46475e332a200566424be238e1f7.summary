by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:29 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 09:57 est , 1 february 2013 it is where the rich , powerful and influential choose to live away from the spotlight			1
but the well - heeled neighbourhood in @entity6 , where the imposing detached houses start at £ 5million , is now the setting for an up - market spat over a newcomer ’s plans to build an underground swimming pool			2
a group of residents in @entity15 , including @entity16 , tv presenter @entity17 and former banking boss sir @entity18 , are worried that the development may damage their nearby homes			1
project : how the underground pool complex , which has caused the spat between neigbours , may look worried : concerns have been raised about the plans to build the underground pool complex by about a dozen residents , including @entity16 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) former @entity30 chairman sir @entity18 – heavily criticised in the credit crunch for pushing through the disastrous takeover of ailing @entity33 in 2008 – has now instructed lawyers to try to obtain a @entity36 injunction to ban work on the six - bed mansion until comprehensive surveys are carried out on the impact of the basement excavation			1
city derivatives trader @entity42 bought his home for £ 4.87million last year and lodged a planning application with @entity45			2
it involves creating a basement under the existing patio and lawn to house a pool and changing room measuring almost 15 metres , and a games room and wine cellar stretching a similar distance			2
but neighbours want tests to check the potential impact of mr @entity42 ’s plans on underground water levels and what effect this may have on their properties			1
they say a similar basement excavation in the area has left one home close to collapse			2
sir @entity18 , 70 , is bringing the legal action after concerns raised by around a dozen neighbours , including the judge who led the @entity16 inquiry into media standards and former @entity73 presenter mr @entity17			1
injunction : former @entity30 chairman sir @entity18 is bringing the legal action as neighbours want tests to check the impact of the plans at her home close to mr @entity42 ’s yesterday , @entity81 said : ‘ they need to get a geological survey done			1
‘ all we want is for them to make sure that we ’re not in danger			2
we have the @entity88 going through here			2
‘ all we ’ve asked for them to do is make sure that they have the right tests done – the geological tests – around their property because what they ’re trying to do is put a large basement on a small garden and this is on a hill			2
’ asked why the dispute was going to the @entity36 , @entity81 said : ‘ to get the right information so , if permission is given , our houses are not affected either by water being diverted into our back gardens or that it will be dried up because this is clay soil			1
‘ we ’re not nasty people , you know if somebody wants to build something it ’s fine ... you need to do research and if there is a problem we have to know how to deal with it			0
’ asked why the dispute was going to the @entity36 , @entity81 said : ‘ i ’ll leave that to your imagination			1
’ asked how long the dispute had been going on , @entity81 said : ‘ since they moved in			0
’ a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ the judge is not a party to or connected to the legal action			1
he has no comment to make on the legal action or the circumstances			0
’ sir @entity18 ’s lawyers go to court later this month to try to get an injunction to stop the @entity132 from approving the scheme until further notice			1
the @entity132 , set up in 1968 to preserve the character of the area , rules on every development in the conservation area alongside @entity45			0
it has signed an agreement pledging to make no decision before the @entity36 hearing			1
trust chairman @entity142 said : ‘ there are legal proceedings which will be heard in february and the trust has no comment in anticipation of those proceedings			1
’ mr @entity42 , 39 , who lives with his wife @entity149 , declined to comment yesterday but said he was happy for the court to make a judgment			0
@entity45 said it had received two planning applications for the site			0
a spokesman said one was being considered and the other was being appealed			0
it was founded at the start of the 20th century as a ‘ model community for people of all classes living together in beautiful houses ’			0
the beauty of @entity15 undoubtedly remains but – with its houses now costing anywhere between £ 5million and £ 50million – it has become the preserve of the powerful and the famous			1
the area ’s appeal owes much to @entity167 , the vicar ’s wife who wanted to build better housing for the poor			0
she set up a trust which initially bought land owned by @entity173			0
her aim was that ‘ the houses will not be put in uniform lines nor in close relationship ’ and not be built without ‘ consideration for picturesque appearance ’			0
areas of woodland , hedgerows and mature trees were to be retained and work began in 1907 , with the development soon spreading on to more land			0
cottages were built for rent at low rates , but after the @entity191 rising costs ended the ability of the private sector to offer such housing			0
from then on the trust ensured coherence in design but the houses went to more affluent buyers			0
residents now include @entity201 of @entity202 , prince @entity204 ’s godfather , @entity205 the surgeon and scientist , and tv host @entity208 .			1

residents in @entity15 seek @entity36 injunction
concerned neighbours include @entity16 and @entity17
