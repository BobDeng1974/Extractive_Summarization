there was a social media meltdown last week when @entity2 was snapped with a brunette looking presumably post-sex - cosy on the balcony of his hotel room in @entity6 last week			1
it 's been a mere eleven weeks since the death of his long - term girlfriend @entity9 - a shockingly short period of mourning for a woman he spent 13 years with , according to most of the posts and comments			1
which begs the question : how long is the official mourning period supposed to be ? what is the acceptable length of time someone like @entity2 is supposed to wait before being linked to anyone else ? @entity2 's long term girlfriend , @entity23 committed suicide in march earlier this year a quick survey of around a dozen friends settled on ‘ at least a year ' - with the view that the longer the relationship , the longer the person should take to get over losing them			1
but is there really a ‘ one size fits all ' model for grieving ? particularly for someone struggling with desperately tragic and traumatic emotions triggered by a partner 's suicide ? i 've seen people who i know loved their partner passionately , react very differently after losing them to either death or divorce			1
some dealt with death in a matter or fact fashion and got on with the task of rebuilding their lives quickly			2
others never did recover , choosing instead to exist in a voluntary time warp , remaining faithful to their past , absent partners forever by reliving their memories on a mental conveyor belt , put on a never - ending loop			2
how we cope is dependent on our moral code , upbringing , personality , life experience , religion , maturity and a thousand other individual factors			2
@entity64 says that sex can be a way of coping when dealing with grief some people deal with loss by disappearing under the duvet for months			1
others drink their way through it or bury themselves in work			2
a friend of mine ran her way back to sanity after her partner died unexpectedly			0
it made perfect sense to her : she wanted to run from what had happened , so she did			0
another locked himself away for eight months with endless box sets and basically distracted his brain until he could face the horror of what happened			0
we all have different coping mechanisms			0
@entity2 has been notoriously unfaithful in the past			1
i 'm not sure what we expected of him but it was fairly predictable that he 'd try to make himself feel better by sleeping with someone			0
sex is a coping mechanism for sex addicts : just as alcoholics fall off the wagon during a crisis , sex addicts fall into bed with strangers			0
add to this that men and women tend to deal with the death of a relationship differently			1
women like to make sense of what 's happened before moving onto the next			0
a lot of men do n't ever analyse their relationships or life circumstances and remain action focused			0
if they find themselves single , for whatever reason , their solution is simply to find another partner - so that 's what they do			0
there is also another very human , primitive reason for seeking sex after a tragic loss : it provides comfort , albeit temporary			0
@entity2 's actions might not be terribly sensible , popular or mannerly but it 's not uncommon to crave sex - the act of which creates life - when confronted with death			1
