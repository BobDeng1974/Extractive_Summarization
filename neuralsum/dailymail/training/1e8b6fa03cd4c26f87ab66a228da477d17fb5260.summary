as such a custom made @entity3 given to @entity4 on his 80th birthday had to be fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate his ample rump			2

me and my rover : this rare series 1 @entity3 , given to @entity4 as an 80th birthday present , is set to make £ 60,000 when it goes under the hammer in october the 4x4 was used to ferry @entity4 around his sprawling 300 acre @entity24 estate in @entity26 after he retired from political life - and almost 58 years later still only has 12,000 miles on the clock			1
the vehicle was used to tow a family ’s horse box for almost 20 years before they put it away for storage - aware of its fascinating provenance			1
it comes with a log book and tax disk emblazoned with @entity4 ’s name proving its previous vip ownership			0
manufacturers also added a padded fold - down arm rest , a lather clad grab handle fitted to the bulk head and a specially designed foot - well heater - handy for those chilly @entity26 mornings			2
... and how she looks now : fifty - eight years later the custom made @entity3 is in good condition and still only has 12,000 miles on the clock provenance : the log book shows the signature of the @entity53 sir @entity4			1
the 4x4 was used to ferry @entity4 around his 300acre @entity24 estate in @entity26 after he retired from political life auctioneers expect the @entity3 to fetch more than 375 times the £ 150 @entity4 ’s relatives sold it on for , more than 15 years after his death			1
@entity62 @entity61 said : ' in view of @entity4 ’s position as the foremost statesman of the 20th century we expect a lot of interest			0

it was then sold off for just £ 160 in a farm sale in the early 1970s to a man called @entity75 had no idea how to get the @entity3 home and asked friend @entity78 to help him transport it			0
for the larger person : the @entity3 was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate @entity4 's ample rump , a foot heater and a special box said to be for his bricklaying tools when mr @entity78 , the current owner , looked at the log book and saw who the original owner was he immediately bought the car for double the price			1
bizarrely it was then used by the @entity95 family to tow their horse box for a number of years before being stored away in a shed for safe keeping			2
mr @entity78 believes @entity4 used the wooden box , specially fitted into the pick - up bed for storing a trowel and mortar so @entity4 could indulge his hobby for bricklaying whenever it suited him			2
