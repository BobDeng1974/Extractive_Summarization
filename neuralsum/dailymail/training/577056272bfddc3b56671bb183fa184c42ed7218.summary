the @entity1 mp is a ' very strong supporter ' of coalition with the @entity3 the @entity5 are doomed to defeat at the 2015 general election if @entity7 gives in to @entity9 ' obsessives ' and allows policy to be driven by a fear of @entity12 , mp @entity4 haswarned			1
mr @entity4 believes his own @entity14 stance as well as his support for gay marriage and green policies contributed to his local party voting not to re-select him as its candidate after 30 years in the @entity20			1
he told the @entity21 a shrinking grassroots membership was becoming increasingly ' extreme ' on a variety of issues after becoming the second prominent @entity5 ejected in a week			2
and he hit out at ' obsessives like the people who organise this letter - writing to the prime minister on negotiation '			0
some 95 conservative backbenchers signed a letter drafted by senior backbencher @entity31 calling for @entity32 to be able to block any aspect of @entity35 legislation			2
' we have a shrinking membership which means you tend to get predominantly among those remaining activists people with probably more extreme views than the average @entity43 voter and that applies to issues like the @entity35 , on issues like gay marriage , ' mr @entity4 told the newspaper			1
' if we allow @entity12 and our fear of @entity12 to be what drives our policy that will lead us undoubtedly to defeat			0

rather than trying to match @entity12 , @entity7 and the @entity5 should be seeking to expose the party 's policies as ' incoherent and inconsistent ' the mp said ' clearly , we are threatened within the @entity55 by people 's obsessive interest in this issue , which is not shared by the majority of conservative voters and certainly is not shared by the general public , ' rather than trying to match @entity12 , the @entity5 should be seeking to expose its policies shown as ' incoherent , inconsistent , inadequate and in many places plain wrong ' , he said			0
in comments unlikely to improve relations with local party members , the @entity1 mp also declared himself a ' very strong supporter ' of coalition with the @entity3 , which had ' achieved things that could n't have been achieved by one party on its own '			1
and he warned @entity5 not to block the @entity79 rail project ' for what i would see as little @entity83 reasons ' .			0

@entity4 was *de-selected* by his local *constituency* in @entity1 this week
*blames* his defeat on right - wing views of conservative activists and hits out at @entity9 backbenchers
