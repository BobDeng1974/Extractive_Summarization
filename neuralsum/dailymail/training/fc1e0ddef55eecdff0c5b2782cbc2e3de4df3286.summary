by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 28 august 2013 an innovative new approach which uses pop - up rooms designed to be reminiscent of a bygone era is helping to reassure dementia patients			1
@entity5 - which are set up like rooms from past decades - are used to help calm those in hospitals and care homes by taking them back to more familiar times			1
designed in retro themes they are filled with authentic furniture and memorabilia which is hoped to get dementia sufferers talking about the memories they still retain			0
the concept involves the creation of pop - up rooms reminiscent of a bygone era the pioneering design includes a 1950s pop - up pod , pub , cinema , dance hall and vintage store , as well as many others with features from the 1960s			1
they have now become a fixture in more than 40 @entity38 , care homes , day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009			1
and in a further boost to the unique nostalgia product creator @entity19 , 35 , has now got the backing of two judges from @entity47 ’s @entity21 ’ den to roll the pods out worldwide			1
mr @entity50 and ms @entity22 agreed to each give £ 50,000 to the project in exchange for a 22.5 per cent share			2
@entity19 described the process of going on the show as ' one of the scariest things i ’ve ever done ' and now intends to break into the @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
the father - of - two , from @entity63 , @entity64 , first came up with the idea of the pod after forming a close friendship with an elderly neighbour and his wife - who suffered with dementia			0

mr @entity19 , from @entity64 , came up with the idea of the pod after forming a close friendship with an elderly neighbour and his wife - who suffered with dementia over a period of several months @entity19 drove @entity78 , 98 , to and from a care home to see his terminally ill wife			1
when she sadly passed away , the pair became close friends , going to the cinema together and to the local pub. @entity19 had also been going through a tough time after losing his job and splitting up with his girlfriend , so they became inseparable			2
the trips with @entity91 , who is now in a care home himself , became the inspiration behind @entity19 ’s innovative product , @entity96 , or @entity5 for short			2
this pop - up room harks back to a 1950s living room , complete with retro tv , a wireless , classic wallpaper and a vintage table			1
mr @entity19 said such a room enables a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment he realised the importance of familiarity for sufferers and the need for more stimulating surroundings for those living with the degenerative illness			1
@entity19 decided that creating a cost - effective pop - up reminiscence room would enable a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment that would reduce the anxiety in people with dementia			1
' i ’d never been in a care home before , i ’d never witnessed dementia , never heard of it before , and everything just stemmed from that , ' said mr @entity19			2
' i used to wait in reception and have a cup of tea and had people come up to me thinking i was their son or husband			0
here a mock - up of an old - fashioned pub helps to jog a patient 's memory and reminds them of when they were younger and less ill. the rooms have become a fixture in more than 40 @entity38 trusts , care homes , day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009 ' they were back in the @entity147 and @entity148 , in a different world and i got into dementia research from there			1
@entity91 was always talking about the @entity147 and the war too			0
' he soon created a handful of themed rooms with era - specific furniture , including a television and radio from the era , standard lamp and rug with the intention of being a homely space			1
there are also music , films and newspaper articles from the time			0
@entity19 appeared on @entity21 ’ den on sunday where he was quizzed by @entity22 and @entity170 before they offered the substantial investment			1
the trio have also agreed to donate some of the company ’s profits to charity			2
' i always wanted to give something back , ' said @entity19			2
' it ’s a commercial business but if it made a lot of money we all came to an agreement that we would give a percentage of the profits back to a charity such as the @entity188			0
' the entrepreneur added that he can not believe how much his life has turned around since meeting @entity91 , who he still tries to visit as often as he can			0
he said : ' i was volunteering and working in care			0
it was a struggle and we did n’t have a lot of money			0
it seems crazy but we were having our first baby and i thought ‘ how are we going to survive ? ’ ' i had a dream and this dream told me everything about what it was i was going to do and @entity5			0
i ’ve never had anything like that before , and am not really religious , but i just had to do it			0
' i got a credit card , which was a big risk and put £ 3,000 into the business and have never looked back			0
