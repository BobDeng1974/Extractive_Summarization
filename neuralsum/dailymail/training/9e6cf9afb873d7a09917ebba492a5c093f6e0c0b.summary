by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 10:17 est , 22 november 2013 commuters in @entity4 could soon pick up @entity6 orders at their local underground station under plans to turn ticket offices into parcel drop - off points			1
@entity11 is reportedly in talks with the online retail giant after it announced it 's going to close all 240 ticket offices by 2015 with the loss of 750 jobs			1
mayor of london @entity17 announced the closures yesterday , along with a 24 hour tube service on certain lines over the weekend , saying he wants to fully automate tickets sales instead			1
but today it was reported that @entity11 is now in talks with @entity6 over possibly converting the hundreds of empty offices into parcel collection points			1
plans : @entity11 are reportedly in talks with @entity6 to turn ticket offices , left empty by plans to fully automate ticket sales by 2015 , into parcel collection points ' click and collect ' : pick - up lockers , similar to this one pictured , could be installed in the empty offices it is thought that pick - up lockers - which allow customers to collect goods bought online and avoid missing a delivery to their home - would be installed in the spaces			1
the news comes as supermarket giant @entity41 announced a deal with @entity11 earlier this week to launch similar ' click and collect ' services in car parks of six underground stations			1
instead of delivering a parcel an address , @entity6 customers can opt for their purchases to be dropped at a locker location			2
this removes the risk of being out when it is delivered in the post			0
once the parcel arrives at the locker , the buyer will get an e-mail notification with a unique pick - up code and a barcode			1
the email will also include details of when the lockers - often located in supermarkets - are open			2
when the customer arrives at the locker , they then enter the pick - up code or scan the barcode , releasing the package			2
customers have three business days to collect the parcel before it is sent back to the @entity6 depot for a refund			2
the service costs £ 1.99 for next day delivery or customers can chose a free service - where goods take around two business days to reach the lockers			2
when contacted today , @entity6 declined to comment			2
@entity81 , director of commercial development at @entity11 said ' we have set out our vision for the future of the tube which includes the introduction of 24 hour services at weekends , simpler ticketing , easier refunds and @entity91 across our network			1
all tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled at all times			0
' as part of our broader commercial development , we are working with retailers to transform the services on offer for our customers			0
this week it was announced that we are working with @entity41 on a trial to offer click and collect services at six of our @entity106 station car parks and are looking to work with other retailers to offer similar services			1
' yesterday mr @entity17 and @entity106 managing director @entity109 announced the radical changes to the @entity111 - which will be implemented over the next two years			2
they said six major central @entity4 stations will have special customer points to help tourists with ticket machines , while every station will be staffed while the tube is running			1
as well as closing ticket offices , they announced the @entity86 will run 24 hours a day on fridays and saturdays on certain lines			1
the vast majority of stops on the new night route map are north of the @entity125			0
the new weekend service will run on core parts of the system - initially the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and jubilee lines and parts of the @entity134			1

mr @entity17 said : ‘ for 150 years the @entity86 has been the beating heart of @entity4 , its tunnels and tracks providing the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to drive the development and economic growth of our great city			0
‘ now it is time to take the tube to the next level and so for the first time in @entity4 's history , we will provide a regular 24 - hour @entity86 service at weekends			1
radical : the mayor announced a weekend service will run through the night on the system - initially the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and jubilee lines and parts of the @entity134 ' this will not just boost jobs and our vibrant night - time economy , it will further cement @entity4 's reputation as the best big city on the planet to in which to live , work , visit and invest			1
’ but there was threats of retaliation from unions yesterday			0
@entity184 , leader of the @entity186 rail union , accused @entity4 mayor @entity17 of being the ‘ hypocrite of the decade ’ , saying the announcement would lead to the closure of all @entity191 ticket offices by the end of next year the @entity193 warned of industrial action , adding that staffing levels will be ' decimated '			1
general secretary @entity196 said : ' the mayor must believe he is some sort of magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while passenger demand continues to rise			0
' throwing in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts to jobs , access and safety			0
' we will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and that means using every campaigning , political and industrial tool at our disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a strategy for that campaign , including a ballot for industrial action			0

‘ commuters will have nowhere to turn when their @entity254 card is lost , stolen or broken			0
it will make the daily commute more difficult for everyone but , more worryingly , there are serious concerns about whether there will be enough staff at @entity4 's busy stations to respond in emergency situations			0
’ @entity106 said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘ without any compulsory redundancies '			0
managing director mr @entity109 defended the job cuts			0
he said : ‘ people are at the heart of this vision - our customers and staff			0
' my commitment to @entity4 is that all tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled in future , with more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket , plan their journey and keep them safe and secure			2
’ the plan aims to deliver savings of £ 270million over the term of @entity11 's business plan to 2020/21 .			0
