an estimated 290 people were killed in drink - drive accidents in 2012 , up by more than a quarter – 26 per cent – compared with the 230 who died in 2011			1
road - safety experts said the figures are alarming as they buck the trend of otherwise falling road casualties and point to a hard core of persistent drink - drivers			2
the figure for 2011 had been the lowest since records began in 1979			1
the number of deaths on @entity16 's roads as a result of drink - driving has increased by 25 per cent the @entity19 called for a lower drink - drive limit and tougher powers for police to carry out random breath tests , which the government rejects			1
critics also blamed cuts in budgets for road safety and anti drink - drive campaigns			0
ministers denied accusations that they are complacent over the issue and admitted they are worried by the latest @entity34 statistics			0
the 290 drink - drive deaths in 2012 represented around one in six ( 17 per cent ) of all reported road fatalities in the year			2
overall there were 250 fatal drink - drive accidents in 2012 , compared with 220 in 2011			1
this is despite the number of accidents involving drink - driving last year falling slightly to 6,680 from the 2011 figure of 6,690			1
of those killed in drink - drive accidents , two - thirds ( 68 per cent ) were drivers and riders over the legal alcohol limit			2

the number seriously injured in drink - drive accidents was 1,210 in 2012 , down from 1,270 in 2011			1

the @entity34 said that despite the big increase in deaths in 2012 , the number of drink - drive fatalities was still around 25 per cent lower than in 2009 and almost 40 per cent lower than the 2005 to 2009 average			1
the annual fatality figure has come down considerably since the late 1970s and 1980s when 1,400 or more deaths a year were recorded , and is now around a fifth of that			0

we are very concerned about it			0
we take it very seriously			0
‘ that is why we are taking forward a package of measures to streamline enforcement against drink - driving , including approving portable evidential breath - testing equipment which will allow for more effective and efficient enforcement			1

behind every statistic is a personal tragedy that could have been avoided for these 290 people			0
‘ we need to keep reinforcing the message that drinking and driving do n’t mix. ‘ all drivers need to take heed of this and ensure that if they are going to be driving , that they adopt a zero - tolerance approach and do n’t drink anything alcoholic at all			0
’ the @entity19 called on the government to lower the drink - drive limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg per 100ml and follow the lead of ministers in @entity125 and @entity126 , who are pursuing a change to the law which is being resisted in @entity129			0
