attorney general @entity0 called on states to temporarily pause death penalty executions on tuesday , until the @entity3 decides a case about the controversial drug cocktails used for lethal injects in some states			1
the @entity3 plans on hearing a case brought up by death row inmates in @entity10 , who believe the midazolam - based drug cocktail used by the state is a breach of their constitutional protection from ' cruel and unusual punishment '			1
the death penalty has long been controversial but became an even bigger issue last year with the botched execution of @entity10 prisoner @entity20 who writhed in pain and clenched his teeth during the 45 minutes it took for him to die from an injection last year			1
@entity0 , who will be retiring once his replacement is confirmed , has long opposed the death penalty since it presents the ' inevitable ' risk of killing an innocent person			0
pictured above speaking at the @entity37 on tuesday ' our system of justice is the best in the world			0
it is comprised of men and women who do the best they can , get it right more often than not , substantially more right than wrong , ' @entity0 said at a tuesday luncheon at the @entity37			0
' there 's always the possibility that mistakes will be made ... it 's for that reason that i am opposed to the death penalty			0
' pending : on tuesday , the @entity55 @entity3 voted to stay the execution of death row inmate @entity57 , pending the @entity59 @entity3 's decision about @entity10 's drug cocktail ' i think fundamental questions about the death penalty need to be asked			1
and among them , the @entity3 's determination as to whether or not lethal injection is consistent with our @entity65 is one that ought to occur , ' @entity0 continued			1
' from my perspective , i think a moratorium until the @entity3 made that determination would be appropriate			2
' since @entity10 uses the same drug combination as other states who enforce the death penalty , the @entity3 's decision could influence death row practices across the nation			1
indeed , @entity0 's comments came the same day that the @entity78 voted to stay the execution of prisoner @entity57 because the state 's lethal drug combination is similar to @entity10			1
' if use of midazolam as the first drug in a three - drug lethal injection protocol is determined to be cruel and unusual — and therefore unconstitutional — then @entity55 's precedent approving the use of midazolam and the current @entity55 three - drug protocol will be subject to serious doubt as to its continuing viability , ' the court wrote in their decision			1
' without a stay of execution in this case , @entity55 risks the unconstitutional execution of @entity57 , for which there is no remedy			0
' @entity57 , 59 , went to the home of his former mother - in - law , @entity102 , in june 1985			0
he was convicted of killing @entity103 , his ex-wife @entity104 , her sister @entity105 and the former couple 's 5 - year - old daughter			1
room of death : the execution chamber at the @entity55 @entity111 the three women were each stabbed at least 14 times , and the girl was stabbed at least 10			0
prosecutors said bloody fingerprints and palm prints , along with other physical evidence , linked @entity57 to the crime scene			0
the @entity55 @entity3 has previously reviewed the use of midazolam and found it to be effective at rendering the condemned unconscious before the second and third drugs are used to paralyze inmates and then stop their hearts			2
opponents of the procedure say that midazolam does n't prevent inmates from suffering during an execution			0
unsafe ? @entity10 death row prisoner @entity20 was killed in a botched execution in april this year @entity132 has been used in problematic executions in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity10			1
@entity55 has used the drug in 11 executions with no apparent problems			2
@entity55 justices @entity139 and @entity141 said in the dissenting opinion that @entity55 's circumstances are different than @entity10 's and that the @entity55 @entity3 reviewed an exhaustive amount of material to determine that midazolam is constitutional			1
' whatever the majority 's speculation about how the @entity3 may alter the law in the future , this court should follow our precedent as it exists today , ' they said in the dissent			2
@entity10 and @entity55 , uses midazolam as one of three drugs in lethal injection executions			1
the second drug serves to paralyze the inmate and the third one is used to stop his heart			0
in 2008 , the justices upheld the use of a different three - drug combination in a case from @entity166 and set a high bar for challenges to lethal injections			1
chief justice @entity170 wrote then that the court probably would not stop executions unless ' the condemned prisoner establishes that the state 's lethal injection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain			0
' what has changed since 2008 is that states have been forced to change the drugs they use in executions after drug manufacturers took steps to ensure their products are not used in executions			2
the inmates are trying to stop their executions , arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs			0
' the drug protocol in @entity10 is not capable of producing a humane execution , even if it is administered properly , ' @entity191 said			1
last april , @entity10 used midazolam for the first time in a grisly procedure			2
inmate @entity20 clenched his teeth , moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line and the execution was called off			0
@entity20 died 43 minutes after the procedure began			0
@entity10 revamped its procedures in response to the @entity20 execution , including a fivefold increase in the amount of midazolam used			2
in last week 's execution , @entity209 showed no signs of physical distress .			0

the @entity3 will decide this year whether the three - drug combination used in @entity10 executions is constitutional
