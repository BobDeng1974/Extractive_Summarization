fiasco : hundreds of people who bought @entity3 tickets through @entity4 have been told they will have to come to @entity5 to collect the tickets after they failed to arrive in the post @entity24 and @entity25 , who booked tickets and a hotel through @entity4 , were horrified to find out they would have to queue for their tickets in central @entity5 on the day of their event after their tickets failed to arrive			1
mr @entity31 , 28 , said feared they would miss the event anyway if they had to queue for tickets in west @entity5 just an hour and a half before it started			0
‘ i was told that their office would open at 8.00am , ’ he said			1
‘ but the handball event starts many miles away - and a transport nightmare away - at 9.30am			2
‘ so we would have to travel into the centre of @entity5 , join a very long queue then have absolutely no chance of making it to the @entity46 for the event we have paid to attend			1
’ mr @entity31 , from @entity48 in @entity49 , paid £ 250 for the break and tickets for him and buyer wife @entity25 , 26			2
‘ we just wanted to experience the once - in - a - lifetime event , ’ he said			1
some families will be forced to come to @entity5 a day early as a result of the problems while others said they feared missing their event because they were stuck in a queue for tickets ‘ we booked a hotel outside the congestion zone to save money and we are due to see a handball event in the @entity46 which we are excited about visiting			2
’ but when the tickets failed to arrive as promised , mr @entity31 , an online retailer , contacted @entity4 to find out what was going on			2
‘ i spent more than an hour holding on an expensive phone line before anyone at @entity4 answered the phone , ’ he said			1
‘ in his words he said “ yes sir , there has been a major cock up ”			2
he told me it was chaos			0
’ mr @entity31 was told that he and his wife would have to make their way to @entity79 in @entity5 along with thousands of others over the weekend to pick up their tickets			2
he was warned that he would have to be at the office very early on sunday morning as they were expecting long queues			0
but mr @entity31 said the queues could be so long that by the time they get to the venue and got through security , they could miss the event anyway			0
but when he asked about a refund , the @entity4 worker said that they would only refund the £ 5 cost of the courier who did n’t arrive as a ‘ goodwill gesture			2
’ last night dozens of other customers took to twitter to complain about the problems			0

we ’d like to reiterate our apology for this unavoidable delay and naturally we ’re also refunding any delivery charges already paid			0
