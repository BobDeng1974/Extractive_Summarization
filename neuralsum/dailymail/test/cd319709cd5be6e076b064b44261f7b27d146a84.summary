this was tricky for @entity1			2
he did not want to do @entity2 down but at the same time felt the truth ought to be laid bare			1
the eight - second pause was revealing in its length as a delicate topic reared its head			2
where exactly would this club — now on the brink of the @entity11 — be without their billionaire owner @entity13 ? @entity1 looked down at his feet , searching for the right answer			1
‘ i do n’t quite know , ’ he said , head shaking			2
it is n’t worth thinking about			2
he is aware that they ’d be nowhere near a win away from @entity21 promotion , potentially ending the season as champions and enjoying a spectacularly redeveloped @entity24			0
@entity25 has taken @entity2 to the brink of a @entity11 return after two seasons in @entity21 city have already won silverware this season in the shape of a @entity34 win last month ‘ there are a lot of big clubs in @entity21 , two and the conference with good support			1
you only have to look at @entity44 and the crowds they get in the @entity41 , ’ @entity1 added after his side ’s 1 - 1 draw at second - placed @entity37			2
‘ we ’re on the verge of the @entity11 and that ’s only down to @entity1 and his investment and what he ’s doing at the ground			1
’ @entity13 , who made his fortune from financial services , is a rare breed in @entity57 football , unwavering in ploughing his own fortune into the club through love and nothing else			1
it has n’t always been rosy			0
that strategy was downright naive when they chased the @entity66 dream and racked up astonishing debts in doing so			1
@entity69 ’s memorable winner for @entity70 in the 2008 championship play - off final might have cost @entity2 far more than just missing out on top - flight riches			1
if @entity74 had n’t changed his approach they could have folded			1
@entity69 hit the only goal of the game as @entity70 were promoted at the expense of the @entity79 those mistakes — over-paying for decent but not exceptional players — meant the owner had to write off an eye - watering £ 35million worth of debt last year			1
the age of @entity85 dictates they must live within their means			0
@entity74 is far more pragmatic with money nowadays , even though @entity1 was allowed to spend £ 1.65m on four players last summer			1
they later sold striker @entity91 to @entity92 for £ 2m and the squad is among the smallest in all four divisions			2
‘ i ai n’t quite sure we bought the division , ’ @entity1 added			0
‘ we pay all these over a period of time , over a couple of years			0
‘ we will still potentially need to up our budget from where we are [ next season ]			0
i would n’t mind betting that @entity37 have got a bigger budget than us			0
i ’m not saying that to put any pressure on anybody , all i ’m saying is that their squad ’s bigger than ours and i know their players			0
’ @entity112 celebrates his goal at @entity37 which kept @entity2 's eight - point lead at the top of @entity21 @entity2 will become the first @entity117 club to clinch promotion this year should they beat @entity119 at @entity120 on tuesday , in turn ending a two - year absence from the @entity11			1
they have been staying in a @entity37 hotel ahead of the trip across the @entity125 , training at @entity126 today and utilising @entity1 ’s contacts			0
‘ i was at @entity126 for nearly four years , ’ he added			0
‘ i should be allowed to train on the pitch that i built ! we sold @entity130 [ to @entity131 for more than £ 1m in 2004 ] and built a new pitch			2
i will take credit for that			0
’ what he wo n’t take credit for is @entity138 ’s rise back where they belong			0
that ’s reserved for one fanatic with very deep pockets			0
owner @entity13 ( right ) has backed @entity2 to the hilt with his own personal fortune			1

owner @entity74 has ploughed his fortune into the club through love and nothing else
that strategy racked up *enormous* debts when they lost the @entity11 play - off final in 2008
@entity13 wrote off an eye - watering £ 35million worth of debt last year
he is more pragmatic with his money nowadays and @entity2 are on the brink of a return to the second tier
