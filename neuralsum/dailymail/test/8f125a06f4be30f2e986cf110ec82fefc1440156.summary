' @entity49 and drink will be provided as part of an all - inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment			1
' mr @entity6 will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film @entity27 clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured			1
' it is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business			0
it is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off			0
