@entity0 today risked a @entity2 rebuke by wearing a pro-feminism t - shirt to prime minister 's questions			1
@entity6 's deputy leader sat next to @entity7 on the frontbench wearing the shirt declaring : ' this is what a feminist looks like			1
' parliamentary officials have previously ruled that @entity13 should not ' use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points '			0
the prime minister rejected the chance to wear a ‘ this is what a feminist looks like ’ t - shirt – despite being asked five times for @entity40 ’s inaugural feminism issue			1
deputy prime minister @entity41 and the @entity6 leader @entity7 both accepted the challenge – alongside celebrities @entity43 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
before prime minister 's questions in the @entity2 today , ms @entity0 tweeted a picture of herself in the grey t - shirt with the message : ' this is what a feminist will look like at @entity49 's questions today			1
' however , the rules on what @entity13 can wear in the @entity58 are strict			2
last year @entity60 mp @entity59 was rebuked for trying to wear an @entity62 t - shirt during a debate			1
a @entity2 spokesman said at the time : ' by convention members are expected not to use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points – members are expected to make their arguments through their speeches			0
' the row over mr @entity20 's refusal to wear the feminist t - shirt came after mr @entity20 sparked controversy when being questioned over his support of women			1
last year he was asked by the women ’s magazine @entity81 whether he was a feminist			2
he paused before replying : ‘ i do n’t know what i ’d call myself … it ’s up to others to attach labels			0
but i believe men and women should be treated equally			0
’ he was later forced to explain his remarks			0
he told @entity94 : ‘ when i was asked that question , what i should have said is , if that means equal rights for women , then yes			0
if that is what you mean by feminist , then yes , i am a feminist			0
’ ms @entity0 tweeted this picture of herself wearing the t - shirt ahead of @entity101 in the commons last year @entity60 mp @entity59 was rebuked for wearing a ' no more @entity104 ' t - shirt during as debate , when the @entity2 said @entity13 should not wear slogans mr @entity7 meanwhile backed the campaign			1
he said : ‘ @entity108 means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won			0
’ @entity41 added : ‘ i support equality and choice – so yes , i ’m a feminist			2
how on earth in this day and age can you not be ? as a wiser person than me once said : “ men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones			0
” ’ when we asked the pm ’s team why he would n’t wear the t - shirt for @entity40 ’s inaugural feminism issue mr @entity20 said he ’d rather give us a quote instead			1
he said : ‘ whether you are a man or a woman , i passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls			0
‘ as a parent i feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son			0
as a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey has n’t finished yet , which is why i am committed to doing everything i can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity41 posed in the t - shirt for the women 's magazine @entity40 labour leader @entity7 said : ' feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won ' @entity40 ’s editor - in - chief @entity150 said : ' we asked the prime minister five times if he would wear the @entity153 ’s @entity156 slogan t - shirt and send us a snapshot ( it would only take 10 minutes )			1
five times , he declined			0
‘ this is a shame on so many levels , especially given he knew @entity41 and @entity7 had agreed without hesitation , alongside many other influential men who were more than happy to call themselves feminists			1
it seems the prime minister still has an issue with the word “ feminist ”			1
’ @entity166 , of the women ’s rights group the @entity153 , said : ‘ we are very pleased the leaders of the @entity170 ’s three main political parties have publicly pledged their support for advancing equality between women and men , and have endorsed the @entity40 x whistles for @entity177 collaboration , which has relaunched @entity177 ’s @entity156 t - shirt			1
‘ however , we understand making a personal commitment to the cause of feminism is a matter for the individual to decide			0
as it stands , it would appear that @entity20 is not comfortable with identifying himself with the cause of feminism , which , given the huge contribution the feminist movement has made to advancing women ’s rights , is unfortunate			2
’ a report last year by @entity191 and @entity192 found the @entity193 lagging behind @entity6 among female voters			2
and in 2011 mr @entity20 was accused of having a ‘ patronising and outdated attitude to women ’ when he told @entity6 mp @entity195 to ‘ calm down dear ’ during a @entity2 debate			2
@entity191 chief executive @entity199 said : ‘ it ’s a shame @entity20 seems wary of calling himself a feminist when all it really means is advocating equal rights and opportunities for women			2

@entity6 's deputy leader appeared on @entity6 frontbench wearing shirt
seen as a jibe across @entity30 at prime minister @entity20
@entity49 rejected chance to wear a ' this is what a feminist looks like ' t - shirt
@entity41 and the @entity6 leader @entity7 both accepted the challenge
