there ’s nothing like a @entity2 for lifting the profile of a player into the stratosphere			1
now here comes @entity9 ’s latest hero @entity8 , long considered one of the best ball strikers on the @entity11 but one who is going to have to get used to a whole new level of acclaim following his stunning performance at @entity17			1
three points out of four and clinching the winning point ; who could have imagined that two years ago when he was paired with eventual winner @entity22 in the third round of the @entity24 at @entity25 , and looked like a man painfully short of belief			1
@entity8 and captain @entity28 ( r ) are pictured with the @entity2 trophy at @entity17 the 38 - year - old strikes a comical pose while holding the famous trophy aloft @entity8 is congratulated after his singles win clinched the point that won the @entity2 @entity35 hits @entity2 winner ‘ the game ’s all in there but it ’s a hard task getting him to feel like he belongs with these guys at this level , ’ said one of his advisors			1
then 36 , it seemed questionable whether it would ever come out			2
@entity6 has known him for 15 years and believes everything changed when the personable @entity49 defeated a strong field to win in @entity51 in january last year			1
‘ you could almost see him grow after that victory , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ since then he has been so consistent			2
he ’s got some serious game			0
’ @entity8 circled the start of @entity2 qualifying in august last year			1
to that point he ’d never considered it a possibility he could make the team but he knew this time he had a chance			2
in march , he played in the @entity63 in @entity64 and racked up loads of qualifying points			2
poor performances at the @entity68 and the @entity69 this august , however , left him in grave danger of missing out			0
@entity8 almost did n't make the @entity2 team but for a strong finish to his season the @entity49 lines up his putt en route to a decisive singles victory over @entity78 he rang captain @entity28 , who spelt it out in stark terms			1
‘ you ’ve got to go and play the @entity83 and the @entity84 ( the final two qualifying events ) , ’ said the @entity81			0
‘ i ’ve got to be honest , the picks usually go to experienced players			0
’ the pressure was seriously on then , but how @entity8 delivered , winning the first of those events			1
he had shown he belonged			0
asked on the eve of the @entity2 what it was like to make his debut at the age of 38 , he replied : ‘ everyone ’s time is different			1
i was nowhere near the level of making the team in my 20s but my time is now			0
’ @entity8 was delighted when @entity101 was assigned to partner him			1
their careers might have developed in different ways but the two men have a lot in common			0
what a fine partnership it proved , with their two foursomes victories			0
they were a combined nine - under - par for those two matches and had just two bogeys			0
@entity9 's @entity2 team celebrate retaining the trophy after a 16.5 - 11.5 victory at @entity17 @entity8 was thankful to be partnered with the experienced @entity101 ( @entity117 ) so to the singles on sunday , and a tough match in prospect against @entity121 firebrand @entity78			1
@entity8 never gave him a look - in			2
when it was over , he draped the @entity126 flag over his shoulders and got rid of his inner racing - car driver by spraying his team - mates from a jeroboam of champagne			0
‘ it ’s just been an amazing few weeks for me , ’ he reflected			0
‘ i feel so lucky for it to have come down to my match for the winning point			1
’ with that , he stopped and a little moisture came to his eyes			0
as ever , his team - mates were ready to help him out when necessary			0
as one , they took the opportunity to break into a round of applause			0
it was @entity144 at @entity17 and while there might never be one like this , there should be more great days for @entity8 in the years to come .			1

@entity9 retained the @entity2 with victory over the @entity121 at @entity17
@entity8 clinched winning point with singles victory over @entity78
the @entity49 claimed three out of four points on his debut , aged 38
