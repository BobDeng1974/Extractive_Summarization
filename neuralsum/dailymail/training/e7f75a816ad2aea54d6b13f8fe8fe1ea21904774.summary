by @entity0 @entity1 hopes to raise funds for her new lingerie company by pawning her collection of designer goods most people considering starting a business would begin by asking their bank for a loan			1
but former model @entity10 is taking a novel approach to raising funds for her new lingerie company , by pawning her collection of designer goods			1
not a materialistic person , miss @entity10 , 47 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , had barely used the @entity17 and @entity18 handbags she amassed during her days as a model alongside @entity20 and @entity21			1
and for 16 years they had been gathering dust in her father ’s attic			1
but when mother - of - two miss @entity10 decided to launch @entity27 , she remembered an ex-boyfriend called @entity29 , and the pawn broker ’s shop he runs in @entity32			2
and now she is hoping to make around £ 50,000 by selling her @entity17 and @entity18 bags , as well as several diamond rings , a bracelet and a necklace			2
tonight , the former model will appear on @entity40 documentary @entity38 to find out how much her collection is worth to mr @entity29			2
it is without doubt an unusual approach to raising money			2
although perhaps not to mr @entity29 , who deals with everyone from bankers flogging vintage @entity47 , to people like miss @entity10 chasing entrepreneurial dreams			2
and after coming up with @entity50 over a bottle of wine with her sister and friend , miss @entity10 decided to set about pawning the designer items she had thought would never see the light of day again			1
miss @entity10 said : ‘ we ’d been toying with the idea for a couple of years			1
and my sister said “ but @entity61 we ’re going to have to go to the bank ” and i ’m like “ banks , @entity66 , re-mortgaging houses			0
no. ” i ’d seen @entity29 on tv shows last year and i thought well let ’s give it a go			0
’ ( l to @entity71 ) @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity29 , @entity75 , @entity76 of @entity77 some of the items were gifts from the mother of two ’s ex-husband – a violent drug dealer who wooed miss @entity10 while on the run from police			0
others she acquired during her modelling days , on the catwalk and fronting campaigns and catalogues for the likes of @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
and while one , a @entity18 handbag she bought herself , was difficult to let go of , most were barely ever used by @entity95			0
for 16 years @entity1 appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns such as the one pictured for @entity91 , rubbing shoulders with the world ¿ s top models and she said : ‘ i ’ve had the @entity17 handbags , the @entity18 handbag , some beautiful jewellery			1
i ’ve still got my @entity103 watch , lots of designer clothes – @entity92 , @entity17 dresses , i love @entity17			1
‘ but as beautiful as they were i could n’t remember ever even using them			0
some of them were given to me but i bought one of the bags , a @entity18 one			0
and they had n’t been used for 12 years			1
’ she added : ‘ i ’m not a very materialistic person			0
when i was a model i had some really nice clothing and handbags and i did sometimes use them but not a lot			0
i ’m happier in jeans and a t - shirt			0
’ @entity95 ’ modelling career began as a 14 year old , when celebrity photographer @entity121 asked her to appear in a shoot he was doing with @entity124 rocker @entity123			1
and for the next 16 years she appeared on the catwalk and in campaigns , rubbing shoulders with the world ’s top models , before being diagnosed @entity130 , a rare but at times debilitating disease			1
the disease , which can be brought on by stress , saw the naturally slender model balloon from nine stone to 16 , develop facial hair and lose most of the hair on her head			1
she also developed a hunch in her neck , which caused her to shrink two inches , and she became a recluse in her own home after giving up on her career and refusing to be seen by any of her friends			1
but looking back miss @entity10 is not bitter about her illness , instead believing it has shaped the person she is today			0
recalling her days on the catwalk , as she considers returning as a mature model , miss @entity10 said : ‘ i ’ve had a great life with it			2
i ’ve worked with @entity20 [ @entity152 ] and @entity21 [ @entity21 ] and @entity153 and they ’re very professional			1
the former model will appear on @entity40 documentary @entity38 as she waits to see how much her collection is worth to mr @entity29 ‘ they ’ll smile , say hello , there ’s no them and us , i never felt that at all			0
at the end of the day i was really proud that i was in their presence			0
there was this one show we did and i just remember seeing @entity21 and @entity20 backstage hugging each other and thinking " @entity66 , i wish i had a camera "			1
' they were in their little world those two and i remember thinking " wow , they are so big "			2
’ miss @entity10 will appear in tonight ’s episode of @entity38 , which airs on @entity40 at 8pm			0
the programme will see her offering three handbags – one @entity18 and two @entity17 – two pairs of diamond earrings , one diamond bracelet and three rings to mr @entity29			0
and it will reveal whether or not she is made a cash offer for the items .			0
