an ancient partial skull provides the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside @entity3 and could have interbred 55,000 years ago			1
recently discovered in @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area			1
the find challenges a previous theory that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in @entity15			1
an ancient partial skull ( pictured ) provides the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside @entity3 and could have interbred 55,000 years ago professor @entity18 of @entity19 holds up the 55,000 year old partial skull the presence of the skull and its dating casts light on what may be the first human migrations out of @entity27 the skull fragment , centre is placed between a @entity3 skull , left , and a complete modern human skull , right , showing how it more closely resembles the modern human skull the ‘ @entity35 cranium from @entity36 ( @entity7 ) foreshadows the first @entity15 modern humans , ’ according to the study , published in @entity39			1
modern @entity15 have inherited about four percent of their genes from @entity3 , meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past			1
‘ it has been suspected that modern man and @entity3 were in the same place at the same time , but we did n't have the physical evidence			2
now we do have it in the new skull fossil , ’ said palaeontologist @entity44 , from @entity45 ( @entity45 ) in @entity46 , @entity47			1
despite the speculation , there is as yet no proof that the skull is from an individual descended from a human - @entity3 tryst			2
but , the researchers said , the specimen ' provides important clues about the morphology of modern humans in close chronological proximity to a probable interbreeding event with @entity3			1
' recently discovered in @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , ( the exact location is marked with a circle ) , the bone sheds new light on early humans living in the region the prehistoric cave ( pictured ) has an impressive archaeological sequence and spectacular speleothems - mineral deposits formed from groundwater within underground caverns , such as stalactites , the experts said the enormous @entity36 cave was discovered by accident after a bulldozer broke through the roof while cutting a sewer trench for a nearby village			1
it 's thought to have remained sealed for as long as 30,000 years a view of the stalagmites rising form the floor of the cave like the columns of some twisted cathedral @entity36 , in @entity6 is located in the region where @entity3 periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in @entity15 forced them to migrate to warmer locales , such as the @entity35 region animal bones and prehistoric tools were among the other discoveries made inside the @entity5 it is commonly thought that @entity3 died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources			1
a recent study by the @entity106 suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred			2
experts believe that @entity3 ‘ may have survived in dwindling pockets of @entity15 ’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct , instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans			1
the study did n’t cover eastern regions such as @entity114 and @entity115 , where @entity3 are also known to have lived			0
‘ so it is still possible @entity3 lingered later in some areas , ’ professor @entity116 said			0
‘ overall pattern seems clear - the @entity3 had largely , and perhaps entirely , vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago			1
’ the @entity121 is located in a region where @entity3 periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in @entity15 forced them to migrate to warmer locales , such as the @entity35 region			1
the prehistoric cave has an impressive archaeological sequence and spectacular speleothems - mineral deposits formed from groundwater within underground caverns , such as stalactites , the experts said it is situated along the only land route available for ancient humans to travel out of @entity27 to the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity15			2
‘ modern humans and @entity3 likely encountered each other foraging for food , ’ dr @entity44 said			1
together with the study ’s lead investigator , professor @entity141 of @entity19 , he found the partial cranium was covered in a patina of minerals produced by the wet conditions of the cave			0
the patina allowed experts from the @entity151 of @entity7 to use uranium - thorium dating technique , which determined that the skull was between 50,000 and 60,000 years old			2
dr @entity44 said that the skull contained a relatively small brain of around 1,100 millilitres			0
the modern human brain averages around 1,400 millilitres in comparison			0
he explained that several features of the cranium resemble a modern man ’s skull , such as the lack of the occipital bun – a bony formation on the back of the skull			0
because the skull is from an adult , @entity45 researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave ( pictured ) researchers work inside the lower part of @entity175 cave , installing the grid the vast @entity5 is located in a region where @entity3 periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in @entity15 forced them to migrate to warmer locales , such as the @entity35 region it is also along the only land route for humans to travel out of @entity27 to the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity15 this photo made available by the @entity175 research team shows excavations at area c of the cave ( see below ) the cave is situated along the only land route available for ancient humans to travel out of @entity27 to the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity15			1
‘ modern humans and @entity3 likely encountered each other foraging for food , ’ dr @entity44 said			1
a map of the cave is shown and the location of the skull marked with a triangle ‘ it has been suspected that modern man and @entity3 ( illustrated ) were in the same place at the same time , but we did n't have the physical evidence			1
now we do have it in the new skull fossil , ’ said palaeontologist @entity44 while its purpose is unknown , @entity3 had the bun , which resembles a bony hot dog bun with a groove down the centre , but modern humans do not			1
the @entity36 fossil 's gender is unknown because it is missing the brow ridge - one marker for gender differences			0
the skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof			0
an archaeologist using the route is shown because the skull is from an adult , @entity45 researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave			2
dr @entity230 from the university , said : ‘ this leads us to believe that there are likely more fossils in the cave where other bones associated with the skull might be found			0
’ the skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof of the previously unknown cave , which had been sealed for 30,000 years and an excavation programme followed			2
commenting on the find , professor @entity116 , @entity244 in human origins at the @entity246 , said : ‘ in terms of its shape , this braincase portion clearly represents a modern human , and closely resembles the skulls of @entity15 “ @entity253 , ” though for an adult individual it is a very small and gracile ( presumably a female )			2
‘ without accompanying dna data it is impossible to say whether the @entity175 skull contains @entity259 from an interbreeding event , but its resemblance to @entity253 ( who like recent @entity15 retained a small percentage of @entity259 ) and to recent @entity27 ( who on average have much less @entity3 dna ) , suggests that any @entity3 influence on its skull shape is minimal			1
‘ @entity36 might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesised out - of - @entity27 event about 60,000 years ago , a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across @entity137 , and also into @entity15			1
‘ its discovery raises hopes of more complete specimens from this critical region and time period			0
’ yesterday it was announced that fishermen working off the coast of @entity282 have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago			2
the short , thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in @entity137 , according to anthropologists			0
the discovery suggests that it belonged to a previously unknown ancient human lineage			0
the fossilised lower jawbone ( above ) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of @entity282 experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in @entity137 until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago			1
the bone was was dredged up in a fishing net from the @entity305 submarine channel , about 15 miles ( 25km ) off the west coast of @entity282			0
anthropologists from the @entity307 in @entity282 and the @entity308 in @entity309 who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread throughout @entity137			0
homo erectus , remains of which have been found in @entity316 , @entity317 , and mainland @entity318 , tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth			0
the @entity305 mandible ( centre ) found off the coast of @entity282 is much larger than the lower jawbones of @entity315 from @entity316 ( left ) and @entity318 ( right ) , despite its much younger age according to the researchers researchers say that this suggests the robust - jawed ' @entity305 man ' had a different evolutionary origin from the ' classic ' homo erectus found in the area			0
it could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of @entity315			0
dr. @entity337 , an anthropologist at the @entity308 in @entity309 who was involved in the study , told @entity340 : ' it is a well - preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position			0
' what we can say is that it is clearly different from the known homo erectus populations from northern @entity318 and @entity316 , and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so			0
' he added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans			2
the @entity354 ( seen above ) , where the jawbone was found , was once been part of mainland @entity137			0

partial skull was recently discovered in @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7
provides evidence modern humans may have interbred with @entity3
two species co-existed in the same region around 55,000 years ago
find challenges theory that two species met in @entity15 *10,000* years later
