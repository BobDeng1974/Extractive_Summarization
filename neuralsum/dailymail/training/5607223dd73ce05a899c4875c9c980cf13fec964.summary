the country ’s biggest car park chain has been fining drivers for putting pay - and - display tickets in the wrong place on their dashboards , according to a @entity8 mp			1
@entity9 made the claim in @entity11 yesterday as he called for an inquiry into the ‘ disgraceful behaviour ’ of @entity14 , which runs more than 500 car parks nationwide			1
the mp for @entity17 , in @entity18 , said he had been contacted by commuters complaining about the actions of wardens at his local railway station			2
private parking firms like @entity14 ' fleece ' motorists unfairly , @entity8 mp @entity9 ( right ) told the @entity27 today they had ‘ fined people for allegedly displaying their ticket on the wrong place on the car ’s dashboard ’ , he said			1
he asked @entity34 , the @entity35 : ‘ can you contact the transport minister and business minister and call for an urgent inquiry into this disgraceful behaviour by @entity14 ? ’ mr @entity9 said commuters had also complained about being fined for parking in a restricted area of the car park that had not been clearly signposted			1
‘ my constituents have been fleeced by @entity14 , who have signposted restricted areas improperly and then fined people who innocently park in them , ’ he added			1
@entity14 has been criticised in the past for high charges at hospital car parks and for increasing prices during big events such as the @entity55			2
mr @entity9 said residents using the station car park had been complaining since december about being unfairly targeted by wardens			1
despite paying for parking and displaying a ticket , he added , drivers were told the area they were in was restricted for the use of council staff , whose offices are nearby			2
‘ these are n’t people trying to bend the rules , ’ he said after the debate			2
‘ why would you park on the third floor of a car park , and pay for your ticket , unless you thought you could park there ? ' they restricted this area and did not make it clear , and now the people who got caught out have contacted @entity14 and have heard nothing at all back			1
’ he added ‘ a £ 50 fine is a lot for many people in @entity17 ’			0
mr @entity34 told @entity83 parking charges at stations are a commercial matter and complaints are investigated by the @entity87 , which was not available for comment last night			0
mr @entity9 called for an urgent statement in @entity11 on on the role of private car park owners like @entity14 @entity14 denied it fined people over the placement of tickets			1
‘ @entity14 accepts any ticket that we can see clearly , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ we have no policy on where or how it is displayed , as long as we can see it			0
’ mr @entity9 ‘ has not made any comment to us of late regarding “ wrongly placed tickets ”			2
he has , however , contacted us regarding our bay line markings			0
’ the spokesman said : ‘ on the top level of this car park there is a section designated for customers who pay for premium bay parking			0
' these customers have paid for a designated bay and permit for their use when they park on the site ; therefore we do patrol the site regularly to ensure that other customers who park in that area refrain from doing so in the future			0
‘ we have markings on the ground in front of all the bays that explain which spaces are restricted			0
' there are also large yellow signs in place when entering the car park and a restriction as the deck area is entered			1
' we have reviewed again all our restricted bay markings , which have been refreshed in the last eight weeks , and do believe these to be very clear			0
‘ we only issue ( @entity135 ) if there is a strong reason for doing so , and always take photographic evidence			0
’ in 2003 , motorist @entity139 was fined £ 30 at an @entity14 car park in @entity141 for displaying his parking ticket upside down			1
the firm apologised and cancelled the penalty .			0

demands ministers *launch* an urgent inquiry into disgraceful behaviour
