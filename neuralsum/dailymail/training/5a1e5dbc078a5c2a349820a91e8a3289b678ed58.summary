new @entity1 academy chief @entity0 said the club need to rip up their scouting structure and start afresh if they are to emulate @entity4 in developing young talent			1
the 52 - year - old @entity6 , who was an assistant to @entity8 manager @entity7 at @entity4 and @entity9 , said he was working closely with @entity1 boss @entity10 on his plans for the academy			1
in an out - spoken interview , which is likely to unsettle current staff at the academy , @entity0 says that the set up which he inherited from @entity17 requires a complete overhaul			1
@entity1 's academy manager @entity0 wants to entirely restructure the club 's academy @entity0 watches on with @entity21 during a pre season friendly at @entity1 's training ground ‘ @entity1 want more talented players to come through , because that has been lacking , ’ he said			1
‘ they want me to develop the players from the academy much better than it was done before			2
‘ at this moment , considering the investments the club have made , players have hardly been developed properly			0
this is why they wanted me , a man who can guide the coaches and who can influence the other coaches			0
@entity37 is a product of the @entity1 youth academy but it seems @entity0 wants more quality ‘ @entity42 [ @entity1 chief executive ] wants @entity1 to be the best academy in the world			1
he realises that will cost money and will take time , but that is his ambition			0
‘ the scouting must be restructured all over again			1
it needs to be brought to a level so that we can bring in the absolute best talents from abroad and from @entity52 at an age that @entity10 can immediately work with them			2
the @entity6 coach worked with @entity8 manager @entity7 at @entity9 and @entity4 @entity0 wants the next @entity56 to come through @entity1 's ranks - a big ask to match the legendary @entity4 man ‘ my chief scout at the academy , @entity21 , came and asked me what kind of players i wanted him to look for			1
so i said , the best player i have worked on , @entity56			1
’ in the interview with @entity65 , @entity0 said : ‘ almost every day @entity10 and i go through a number of things			1
he is approachable , but i do have to show him what we are doing			0
we must not go behind his back			0
‘ it is important that @entity10 and i work closely together			2
what i do see is that everybody at the club has the feeling that they need to have the green light from @entity10 before they do anything			0
but maybe that is not the case			0
‘ i have a very good feeling about the way @entity10 and i are working together			0
we both think the technical side of the game is very important			0
‘ but there are a lot of things in the academy which can be improved or should be done different			0
’ @entity0 says that he has a relationship with @entity10 that involves them speaking every day			2

@entity0 has worked with @entity7 in the past
he has worked with the likes of @entity56 and wants @entity1 to produce better
@entity42 wants to make @entity1 's academy the best in the world
' the scouting must be restructured all over again ' says @entity0
