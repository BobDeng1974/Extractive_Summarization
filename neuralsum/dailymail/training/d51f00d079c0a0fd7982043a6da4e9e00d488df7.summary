by @entity0 pensive : scientists have shown that free will can be turned on and off by using electrical stimulations to control monkeys ' minds for centuries free will has been debated - do we have choice over the decisions we make or is it all one big illusion			1
now it seems that scientists have proved that it is the latter – at least in monkeys			1
researchers have shown that free will can be turned on and off by using electrical stimulations to control primates ’ minds			1
they hope that their findings could lead to new treatments for addiction and depression , among other conditions			0
in the experiment , artificially stimulating a brain region believed to play a key role in learning , reward and motivation , caused monkeys to change which of two images they chose to look at – essentially , enabling the scientists to make decisions for them			1
scientists at @entity36 ( @entity36 ) and the @entity37 in @entity38 proved for the first time that stimulation of the ventral tegmental area ( @entity41 ) – a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain – can change behaviour through activation of the brain ’s reward system			1
‘ previous studies had correlated increased activity in the primate @entity41 with positive events experienced by the animal but could not prove that @entity41 activity actually caused behavioural changes , ’ said @entity50 of @entity36 , who co-authored the paper published in the journal @entity53			1
‘ studies in rodents have shown that artificially manipulating @entity41 activity strongly influences behaviour and our work has bridged the gap between rodent and primate , ’ he said			2
to investigate the direct impact of @entity41 activation on primate behaviour , microelectrodes were implanted within the @entity74 of macaque monkeys			1
the research could one day revolutionise the way that human addicts are treated by enabling them to unlearn addiction , such as alcoholism ( illustrated by a stock image ) - although there is of course the sinister possibility of using mind control in humans too scientists have shown that free will can be turned on and off in monkeys by using electrical stimulations			1
they artificially stimulated the monkeys ' ventral tegmental area ( @entity41 ) – a group of neurons at the base of the mid brain – to change behaviour through activation of the brain ’s reward system			2
in an experiment , animals freely chose to look at one of two pictures and by stimulating their @entity41 , the scientists were able to force them to choose to look at one of them in particular			1
mri scans showed that stimulating the @entity41 produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice			0
the scientists think that the research could one day be used to treat addictive behaviour in humans			2
in the first set of experiments , the animals were presented with a pair of images – for example a star and a ball – and could freely chose to look at one image or the other			2
their choice was measured by looking at their eye movement			0
after establishing each macaque monkey ’s preference , based upon which image it looked at most frequently , mild stimulation was applied to the @entity41 when the animal happened to look at the initially non-preferred image			0
soon the animal ’s preference changed and it most frequently looked at what previously had been the less favoured image			0
when the @entity41 stimulation was then applied to the initially preferred image , the monkeys soon changed their preference back to the original choice			0
in a second set of experiments , a monkey watched a 20 - minute video , during which two images were randomly presented every 5 seconds			0
mind control : in the experiment , artificially stimulating a brain region believed to play a key role in learning , reward and motivation caused monkeys ( stock image ) to change which of two images they chose to look at - essentially , making decisions for them and controlling their mind whenever an initially non-preferred image was presented , it was accompanied by mild @entity41 stimulation			1
repetition of the preference test demonstrated that the animal ’s choice was reversed			0
mri scans also revealed that stimulating the @entity41 produced similar brain activity to when the animal received a reward of fruit juice			0
dr @entity50 explained : ‘ our study showed that the timing of @entity41 stimulation is important – when stimulation happens immediately after an action is performed , the monkey is more likely to perform that action – and that it applies ‘ value ’ to a particular stimulus and motivates future behaviour			0
’ ‘ other studies have implicated the @entity41 in learning based on negative , as well as positive reinforcement , and a recent rodent study found that increasing @entity41 activation can relieve depression , possibly by increasing motivated behaviour			0
’ while stimulation currently requires surgery to implant electrodes in the brain , non-invasive methods could be used to treat humans in the future , he told @entity200			2
‘ once non-invasive methods – light or ultrasound , for example – can be applied with a sufficiently high level of precision , they could potentially be used for correcting defects in the reward system , such as addiction and learning difficulties			2

scientists at @entity36 and the @entity37 , @entity38 , have shown free will can be turned on and off in macaque monkeys
electrodes were used to stimulate the region of the animals ' brains that play a key role in learning , reward and motivation
*technique* was used to force monkeys to choose certain images
breakthrough could be used to help humans unlearn addictions
