@entity1 bombing suspect @entity0 is likely to blame his ' role model ' dead brother at trial to avoid the death penalty			1
when @entity0 's case begins , his lawyers are likely to pin their hopes - and the bombings themselves - on his older brother , @entity11 boxer , college student , husband and father who also followed radical @entity14 was named by a friend as a participant in a grisly 2011 triple slaying			1
' he was the eldest one and he , in many ways , was the role model for his sisters and his brother , ' said @entity21 , the former husband of @entity23 's sister , @entity22			1
' you could always hear his younger brother and sisters say , ` @entity23 said this , ' and ` @entity23 said that			1
three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two homemade pressure - cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the iconic race on april 15 , 2013			1
@entity30 , 26 , died days after the bombings following a gun battle with police			1
@entity0 , then 19 , was later found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard			1
jury selection in his federal death penalty trial is entering its second month			0
@entity0 's lawyers have made it clear they will try to show that he was heavily influenced , maybe even intimidated , by his older brother , into participating in the bombings			1
if a jury convicts @entity0 , its decision on whether to give him life in prison or sentence him to death could depend ' on the extent to which it views @entity30 as having induced or coerced his young brother ' to help commit the crimes , the defense argued in a court filing			1
about a decade before the attack , their parents , ethnic @entity61 , had moved the family to the @entity65 from the volatile @entity67 region of @entity68 after living in the former @entity70 republic of @entity71			0
their father , @entity72 , told @entity33 the emigrated in part to escape discrimination			0
the relationship between the two brothers would likely be a key part of the evidence @entity0 's lawyers present even if he 's convicted , said @entity79 , who represented a @entity81 nurse who was spared the federal death penalty in the killings of four patients			1
proceedings : in this january 5 courtroom sketch , boston marathon bombing suspect @entity0 , left , is depicted beside @entity65 district judge @entity88 , right , as @entity88 addresses a pool of potential jurors under the federal death penalty law , juries deciding on a sentence can consider whether a defendant ' was under unusual and substantial duress , ' regardless of whether duress is used as a defense to the charges			2
if the defense is allowed to use evidence of @entity23 's possible involvement in the triple murder , they could argue that @entity0 was under duress to participate in the marathon bombings , @entity79 said			1
prosecutors have said that a friend of @entity23 , @entity107 , implicated him in the killings of three men in @entity110 whose bodies were found sprinkled with marijuana , their throats cut			2
@entity107 was shot to death by an @entity115 agent after authorities said he charged another investigator with a pole while being questioned about the @entity119			0
' if they can show that the older brother is gruesomely involved in the murders , all the more reason that @entity0 felt that not only is he my brother - he is someone not to fool around with			1
i have to do what he says , '' @entity79 said			0
@entity23 's high school friends say he appeared to adjust well to his life in @entity65			1
' as a student , he was like the rest of us , ' said @entity132 , who became friends with @entity23 soon after he moved to @entity134			2
' you could catch him in the library doing work , socializing in the hallways with people he knew , or at a local pizza shop we could go to during lunch			0
' about the same time , @entity23 took up boxing			2
he was a success , becoming the @entity11 heavyweight champion of @entity145 in 2009 and 2010			0
' he was a determined guy , in good shape , a strong guy , ' said @entity147 , then - coach for the @entity145 team			0
' there was nothing unusual about him			0
' after he was barred from competing in a national tournament because he was not a @entity65 citizen , @entity23 drifted away from boxing			2
he took classes at @entity156 's @entity155 for a short time , but dropped out			0
in 2010 , he married @entity158 , a @entity159 woman he met at a nightclub , and the couple had a daughter together			0
authorities believe @entity23 's beliefs became radical during the last few years of his life			1
in march 2011 , @entity68 officials told the @entity115 that @entity23 was a follower of radical @entity14			2
the @entity115 interviewed @entity23 , but closed its investigation several months later after finding nothing linking him to terrorism			2
in 2012 , @entity23 spent six months in the southwest @entity68 regions of @entity171 and @entity67 , where authorities have said they suspect he tried to join insurgents , but was unsuccessful			2
after returning to the @entity65 , @entity23 was twice asked to leave a mosque over outbursts			2
the first time , he stood up at the @entity176 and argued with a preacher who said it was appropriate for @entity179 to celebrate @entity65 holidays			0
two months later , he called a preacher who praised civil rights leader @entity182 a ' non-believer ' who was ' contaminating people 's minds			0
' @entity187 leaders said they told him he would not be welcome if he interrupted again and he did not cause any more problems			0
in their court filings , @entity0 's lawyers have asked prosecutors for any evidence ' showing that @entity23 's pursuit of jihad predated @entity0 's ' because that ' would tend to support the theory that @entity23 was the main instigator of the tragic events that followed			1
' but prosecutors are prepared to argue that @entity0 was a full and willing participant in the bombings			1
they cite a message scrawled inside the boat he was found hiding in , indicating that the bombings were meant to retaliate against the @entity65 for the deaths of civilians during the wars in @entity207 and @entity208			0
' i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished , ' he wrote , according to excerpts filed in court			0
' stop killing our innocent people and we will stop			0
