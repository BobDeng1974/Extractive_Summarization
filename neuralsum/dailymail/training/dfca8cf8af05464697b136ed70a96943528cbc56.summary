by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale the fractured relationship between @entity3 chairman @entity2 and the @entity4 over the @entity6 commission will not be improved at the summer meeting of top - flight clubs			1
@entity2 would normally be expected to attend at least some of the @entity4 summit on june 5 and 6 at @entity10 in @entity11 in his official capacity			1
but instead he is flying to the @entity14 equivalent on the @entity15 , where he will discuss his plans for a fifth tier in a special session with representatives from the 72 clubs meeting in @entity22			1
in demand : @entity3 chairman @entity2 will not be attending a @entity4 summit in the summer , choosing instead to speak to @entity14 clubs about his plans for a fifth tier @entity2 ’s failure to consult the @entity4 about his proposals en masse at one of their summits — he prefers to talk to top - flight teams individually — has upset the @entity4 ’s top brass even though they chose not to have a representative on the @entity3 panel , having withdrawn their chairman @entity36 , his first choice			1
@entity2 named @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 as clubs who fully support his controversial b team proposals			1
@entity46 , who have more than enough players out on loan to field @entity51 and @entity52 teams as well , are another club in favour			0
@entity4 chief executive @entity54 , who faces a revolt over participation if the @entity3 have their way on b teams , has another big issue to confront			1
a number of teams in the top fight , who comfortably sell out every home game , want the @entity4 to allow their many other fans to watch the saturday 3pm kick - offs live on club outlets			2
but @entity54 is said to be against live coverage in that time slot so as not to dilute tv rights holders ’ contracts ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
it will interest everyone searching for sports sponsorship that @entity75 have indicated they want to break into the sports market			1
and certainly the @entity77 in association with @entity75 has a ring about it , especially with the extra interaction it would bring to the competition ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
@entity2 ’s commission presentation received a damning reception from a sceptical media at @entity85			2
but at the same time @entity6 manager @entity88 ’s @entity87 backroom support team were enjoying a far more successful bonding session at @entity90			2
inspiring : sports psychologist @entity91 , who has worked with @entity92 and @entity40 , spoke to @entity88 and the @entity6 backroom support team particularly inspiring was said to be the speech given by sports psychologist @entity91			1
@entity40 players demoralised by giving up a three - goal lead — and probably their title hopes — at @entity99 last monday could have been excused for wanting to do anything but turn up for a club awards dinner the following night			0
but every member of the squad attended the function , demonstrating a resilient team spirit under @entity106			0
resilience : @entity108 was left crying on the pitch after the @entity99 draw but 24 hours later he picked up an award at the club 's players ' awards dinner the @entity114 hit a new low by allowing rabid self - publicist bookmakers @entity116 to run a market on brand of the year when the legion of judges had chosen @entity123 tennis as the winner months ago			2
but it has to be said that the stunning sports review of the year video produced with @entity128 — a rebranded commercial film arm of @entity130 — took such productions to a new level , with relevant @entity133 comments made at the time cleverly linked to the action			0
the 25th anniversary fund - raising dinner of the anti-racism organisation @entity136 at @entity85 on may 20 has been very poorly supported not only by clubs , with only 12 buying tables , but also by the game ’s sponsors , hardly any of whom are going to be there despite almost the full complement having been asked by the organisers			0
the turbulence at @entity148 now includes a trio of popular club ambassadors — @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 — all in danger of losing their positions in new owner @entity158 ’s major cost - cutting operation			0
lawyers are still working on the details of @entity161 ’ reported £ 7m pay - off from @entity38 , though no late hitches are expected			0
tough season : former @entity38 boss @entity161 ' £ 7m pay - off is expected to have no hitches			0

@entity3 chairman @entity2 will not be attending june 's @entity4 summit
he is instead flying to the @entity15 to discuss plans for a fifth tier with the @entity14
@entity75 have plans to break into the sports market in the *future*
