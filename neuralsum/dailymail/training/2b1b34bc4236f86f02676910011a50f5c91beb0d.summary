by @entity0 it 's one thing to try it in training , but a whole different concept to do it at the @entity4 in @entity5			2
yet @entity6 seems to have his ' @entity8 ' penalty down to a fine art - something @entity10 now knows all too well after a @entity12 training session			2
the @entity14 defender steps up from 12 yards , only to chip to ball down the middle and leave the @entity18 goalkeeper slightly embarrassed and visibly annoyed			0
frustrated : @entity10 reacts after @entity6 scores his ' @entity8 ' penalty in @entity12 's training tough luck : it is unlikely @entity10 ( right ) will feature at the @entity4 as he is second choice to @entity24 joker : @entity10 ( right ) does n't look too amused by @entity6 ' cheeky penalty during @entity12 's training session team - mates : @entity10 ( left ) and potential @entity30 striker @entity29 take to the field for training in @entity33 @entity10 is unlikely to get a look in during the @entity4 with regular first - choice ' keeper @entity24 picked for @entity5			1
@entity12 are among the favourites to go far in the world 's greatest tournament , having won it in 2010 , and are in fine form after their @entity42 friendlies			0
having seen off @entity44 1 - 0 in march and @entity45 2 - 0 at the end of may , they face @entity47 on saturday night in their final friendly before the tournament kicks off			0
holders : @entity6 holds the @entity4 trophy aloft after beating @entity52 1 - 0 in 2010 tight grasp : @entity6 will look to be recreating history by going far with @entity12 in @entity5			1

' @entity8 ' penalty is known as the cheekiest and most *confident* of them all
@entity12 are the @entity4 holders and will be defending their 2010 *triumph*
@entity4 kicks off on june 12 with @entity5 v @entity62
