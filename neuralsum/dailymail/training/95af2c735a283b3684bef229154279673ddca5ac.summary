by @entity0 published : 12:02 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 25 june 2013 a nearby solar system is packed with up to seven planets including three ' super-earths ' that may be capable of supporting life , say scientists			1
the planets orbit @entity7 , one of three stars bound together in a triple system 22 light years away in the constellation of @entity12			1
astronomers believe they fill up the star ’s habitable zone - the orbital region just the right distance away to permit mild temperatures and liquid water			2
a record - breaking three planets in this system are super-earths lying in the zone around the star where liquid water could exist , making them possible candidates for the presence of life three of the new worlds are categorised as ' super-earths ' , meaning they have between one and 10 times the mass of the @entity38			1
if , like the @entity38 , they are rocky and possess atmospheres and watery lakes or oceans , they could conceivably harbour life			0
because @entity7 is part of a triple system , anyone standing on one of the planets would see three suns in the sky			1
at night , the two companion stars would be as bright as the full moon on @entity38			0

the brightest star in the sky is @entity7			1
astronomers have estimated that there are tens of billions of such rocky worlds orbiting faint red dwarf stars in the @entity62 an artist 's impression of the view from @entity66 looking towards the planet 's parent star , @entity7 previous studies had identified three planets orbiting the star , including one in the habitable zone			1
the other planets were discovered after astronomers revisited previous data and made new observations using a range of telescopes			0
lead scientist dr @entity79 , from the @entity80 in @entity81 , said : ' we identified three strong signals in the star before , but it was possible that smaller planets were hidden in the data			2
' we re-examined the existing data , added some new observations , and applied two different data analysis methods especially designed to deal with multi-planet signal detection			0
' both methods yielded the same answer : there are five very secure signals and up to seven low - mass planets in short - period orbits around the star			0
' @entity7 is smaller , fainter and cooler than the sun , having just over a third of its mass. as a result , its habitable zone - where conditions are warm but not scalding hot - is relatively close in			2
this is helpful to astronomers because the limits of current technology make it hard to detect smaller @entity38 - like planets in more distant orbits			0
planets in the @entity7 system in relation to their star			1
this is the first system found with a fully packed habitable zone the astronomers believe the star ’s habitable zone is full - there are no more stable , long - lived orbits available within it that could contain other planets			2
if the @entity38 circled the sun at the same distance , it would be far too hot to support life			0
but much milder conditions may exist on planets orbiting close to dimmer , cooler stars such as @entity7			1
since low - mass stars make up around 80 per cent of the stars in our galaxy , the @entity62 , astronomers hope they might provide a rich harvest of other potentially habitable close - orbiting planets			1
' the number of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy is much greater if we can expect to find several of them around each low - mass star , ' said co-researcher dr @entity144 , from the @entity145 in the @entity146			1
' instead of looking at 10 stars to look for a single potentially habitable planets , we now know we can look at just one star and find several of them			1

the bright star at the centre is @entity156 , the two main components of the system , which can not be separated in this image the findings , released by the @entity161 , are to appear in the journal @entity163			0
although the planets are far too small to see with a telescope , they could be detected by looking for the effect of their gravity on the star			0
the gravitational ' tug ' of an orbiting planet makes a star ' wobble ' which in turn causes its light wavelength to fluctuate			0
by measuring these tiny changes astronomers can calculate the planet ’s orbit and mass.			0

planets orbit @entity7 in a triple system in constellation of @entity12
anyone standing on one of the super-earths would see three suns in sky
one super-earth orbiting @entity7 has been identified before but new research shows more potentially habitable planets
