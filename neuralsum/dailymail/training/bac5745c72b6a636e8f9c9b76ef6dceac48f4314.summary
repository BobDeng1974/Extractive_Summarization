peaches , who had ' @entity5 ' tattooed in a heart on her right arm , is said to have become interested in the occultist 's religious theory during her short - lived marriage to musician @entity49 when she was 19			1
at the same time , she also pursued an interest in @entity20 after talking to actress @entity53 , then married to scientologist @entity54			0
she was said to have visited @entity20 centres in @entity56 and @entity57 , before losing interest in the cult			2
more recently , @entity0 , whose husband , @entity21 is @entity61 , developed an interest in @entity22			0
while the marriage to @entity66 failed , @entity0 ' interest in @entity10 's teachings persisted , and she has previously urged her online followers to read his ' super interesting ' books , an interest that worried her family			1
last year her father 's girlfriend , actress @entity72 , said of @entity0 ' interest in the cult : ' you do n’t know if it ’s something that will pass or if it ’s longer than that			1
the thing is , young people , they change their minds a lot			0
' she said neither she nor @entity84 knew anything about the cult , but said the fact that @entity0 had tattooed its name onto her skin indicated that her interest in it might be more than a passing fad			2
@entity5 was said to have been brought to @entity11 from @entity93 in the early 20th century by @entity10 , an infamous occultist and drug addict			1
@entity10 , who was said to have filed his teeth into fangs , was rumoured to drink blood and stage drug - fuelled orgies , and was widely criticised for being ' in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time '			1
@entity10 founded the religion of @entity104 , around which the @entity105 was organised he founded the religion of @entity104 , which was based around the idea of free will , and reorganised the @entity5 's teachings around the same principles			1
one of his books , @entity111 , was among those pictured on @entity0 ' bookshelf			0
@entity10 's followers , however , say he was a highly influential thinker and writer in the field of western esotericism and counter-culture , and in 2002 the @entity120 ranked him 73rd in their list of the greatest @entity11 of all time			1
' his work within the @entity5 was nothing short [ of ] miraculous and he was a beautiful writer and thinker too , as well as magical practitioner ' @entity0 on @entity11 @entity5 founder , @entity10 on 16 march , @entity0 posted a picture of @entity10 's @entity129 alongside the slogan ' do what thou wilt ' , a central tenet of the philosophical law of @entity104 , upon which the thinkings of the @entity5 were based			1
when one follower asked her if @entity10 , who died in 1947 , was a satanist , @entity0 replied saying : ' no , it has nothing to do with @entity141 ideas like satan or @entity143 at all			2
' and when others made references to his less appealing traits , she leapt to his defence , saying : ' all the stuff about him being a @entity150 sympathiser and a racist was lies made up by the press who hated him			0
' he would also just say controversial stuff purely to subvert people 's perceptions of him in the media			0
if you read any of his work , he makes this abundantly clear			0
' his work within the @entity5 was nothing short [ of ] miraculous and he was a beautiful writer and thinker too , as well as magical practitioner			2
' @entity10 called himself ' @entity166 and @entity167 of @entity168 and all the @entity169 within the @entity170 ' @entity10 , pictured in ceremonial garb , liked to call himself ' the @entity172 , 666 ' lived from 1875 - 1947 other celebrities linked to @entity5 include the rapper @entity174 , who has been seen wearing a t - shirt bearing the slogan ' do what thou wilt ' , and @entity180 guitarist , @entity179			1
last year the head of @entity5 in @entity11 , @entity181 , 63 , told the @entity182 that its followers here numbered hundreds rather than thousands			2
he said : ' we are used to being misunderstood			0
many stories about @entity10 , like people saying he filed his teeth down into fangs , are nonsense			2
' you could call us a sex cult in a way , because we recognise , accept and adore the whole process which goes towards making tangible the previously intangible			0
' devotees of @entity5 say it can take years of study to understand the religion , something mr @entity181 , who lives in @entity195 , acknowledged			2
he said : ' you ’re not supposed to just jump straight in to it			0
it takes time and study , but our rituals are not for public consumption			0
you need to join us and go through the initiation process before you can begin to understand			0
' but according to our beliefs we ca n’t turn anyone away			0
so if you are over 18 , are passably sane and are free to attend initiations , then you have an undeniable right of membership			0
