by @entity0 @entity2 manager @entity1 has cast doubt over the possibility of a @entity6 player being able to reveal they are gay during their playing career			1
former @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity13 midfielder @entity12 revealed he was gay in january but he waited until the end of his playing career before going public with the news			1
coming out : @entity12 ( right ) waited until the end of his playing career before revealing he was gay @entity1 says the inevitable scrutiny that would be put on an active player if they came out might discourage them from doing so			1
' because of media interest , maybe no - one will come out , ' @entity1 told @entity2 magazine			1
' he ( @entity12 ) could not come out during his career which means we still have some progress to make in our game			2
' @entity12 should not have had to wait until the end			0
debate : @entity2 manager @entity1 says football still has progress to make on the issue ' but overall he should not have to come out at all because it should just be considered like anything else			2
' it would be good if four , five , six people come out and after that nobody speaks about it anymore because they just think it is people who live their life like they want to live it			0
' i think football is there to provoke moments of happiness , excitement and positive experiences in people , no matter where they come from , what colour skin they have , what religion they are or what their preferred sexuality is			0
' it 's very sad that some people think that this sport should only be reserved for those who have certain characteristics			0
