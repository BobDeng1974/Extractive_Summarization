by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 18:35 est , 18 november 2012 experts fear the deadly disease threatening to devastate 80 million ash trees may have now spread to privately - owned gardens for the first time			1
at least two likely cases of the killer fungus have been discovered in back gardens and they have now been referred to plant inspectors for confirmation			1
until now , ash dieback has been confined to @entity13 land , commercial plantings and nursery stock			1
in total , it has been confirmed at 200 sites , including 116 in mature woodlands			1
forest fire : the @entity13 has started burning infected trees in a bid to stop the spread of ash dieback disease , but it has now spread to domestic gardens the microscopic fungus - chalara fraxinea - is rife across mainland @entity27			1
experts now fear the disease will be more catastrophic than @entity30 which killed 25 million trees here in the 1970s and 80s			1
scientists believe the disease has been present in @entity34 woodland for at least two years , arriving through wind - blown spores from northern @entity36 and @entity37			1
as the tiny spores are transported on the breeze , it is virtually impossible to eradicate , and potential outbreaks in domestic trees will be grim news for gardeners			0
homeowners worried that an ash tree on their land is infected should visit the @entity13 website , which has pictures and videos advising how to spot the disease			1
there is no known cure , but older trees will take years to die			0
the current advice is not to cut down an infected mature tree , but it is important to manage the leaf litter , as it is how the fungus spreads			1
gardeners should attempt to dispose of the leaves within their own property , preferably on a bonfire , rather than transporting them elsewhere which may help spread the disease			0
burn : experts fear ash dieback could ravage @entity68 's 80 million ash trees @entity69 , from the @entity70 , is behind the ashtag.org project , which allows the public to report suspected cases of the disease			1
these are then analysed by experts , with the most likely cases reported to @entity78			0
after looking at thousands of images , the teams has identified 45 suspected sites , including one in west @entity82			2
‘ we have received hundreds of reports over the past couple of weeks and we have had experts examining them to identity those that are likely to be @entity89 , ’ said mr @entity69			0
' we have so far identified 45 sites that are likely to have the disease			2
' ‘ two of these seem like they have been found in back gardens , but they all must now need to be confirmed by the plant health inspectors from @entity78			2
‘ i suspect trees have been infected for some time and it could have arrived here up to five years ago which would explain why it is now so widespread			2
‘ i would urge the public to look at the guidance and take pictures of any suspicious leaves or trees and send them into us			0
’ more than 100,000 ash saplings have been destroyed in recent weeks , while the import and movement of trees has also been banned			2
among those facing the unhappy task of destroying young plantings is broadcaster @entity115 , who planted a wood at her @entity118 farm as part of the @entity120 earlier this year			0
she is set to lose 5,000 ash amid concerns they are infected with the deadly fungus			1
‘ i have been in touch with the @entity126 and they are very concerned and will be advising me next week but from what they know of my situation they say the picture looks grim			0
’ the 61 - year - old told the @entity134			0
a common ash tree : the first confirmed case in the @entity68 was in march 2012 , and since then , dieback has been confirmed at a further 200 sites , with woodlands in @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 among the worst affected ‘ it ’s devastating			1
the nursery where i bought the saplings seem unable to tell me whether they came from @entity148 or not but i fear anyway that i will have to cut them all down and dig up the roots			0
‘ that ’s the message the conservationists are giving out			0
can you imagine what a heartache that will be ? ’ a spokesman for @entity78 tonight said that none of the 200 confirmed cases were in private gardens			2
she said : ‘ our efforts are best placed concentrating on tackling the disease			0
if any cases are confirmed their place of origin will also be confirmed			0

@entity30 detected in gardens for first time
fungus was *previously* confined to woodland sites
fears it may decimate @entity68 's 80 million ash tree *population*
