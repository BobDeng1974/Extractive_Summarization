determined : the mother - of - four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her baby at the recreation center in @entity6 , @entity7 , while her eldest daughter was in a dance class when prudish leisure centre staff told @entity11 to stop breastfeeding in public , she had a few more important things to get off her chest			1
the mother - of - four pulled no punches in telling a manageress that she was well within her right to nurse her 16 - week - old baby at the recreation center in @entity6 , @entity7 , while her eldest daughter was in a dance class			1
and in the end the jobsworth was forced to yield and walk away after mrs @entity11 correctly pointed out : ' it 's the law			1
i can nurse my child with or without a cover			2
' the heated exchange was filmed last week at the @entity25 by mrs @entity11 ' husband who stood quietly by , seeing his strong - willed wife was more than abreast of the situation			1
he later uploaded the footage to the family 's @entity31 channel , which , by today , had already been viewed by almost 300,000 people , many of whom left staunch messages of support			1
the incident began when the female manager at the centre approached mrs @entity11 and demanded she cover up for the sake of ' decency '			1
' it 's like she was waiting on us or saw us for a distance , but as soon as we came in , she told me immediately that i needed to cover up or we needed to leave , ' mrs @entity11 later told @entity48 affiliate @entity47			1
' i walked up , and was nursing him , just because it 's 100 degrees outside , and trying to cover his face and entire body , trying to nurse for such a short period of time -- it 's way too hot to do that			2
it 's not fair or realistic			0
' the mean - spirited manageress approached mrs @entity11 at reception and said : ' i have permission from the city authorities to ask you to cover up			1
' the woman then confusingly states that ' it 's an issue of decency ' before admitting that she did n't think mrs @entity11 ' actions were indecent			1
she continues : ' it 's not you			0
i have permission to ask anybody who walks through the door who 's wearing a sports bra or a bathing top to cover up			2
i can nurse my child with or without a cover ' mrs @entity11 replies : ' but there are people in here wearing bathing suits and showing more cleavage and skin than me ( and they 're not being asked to leave ) '			1
as the staff member says they are not allowed in the lobby either , mrs @entity11 hits back : ' it 's the law			1
i can nurse my child with or without a cover			2
' her husband then steps in to tell the woman : ' okay , i 'm gon na ask you to stop talking to my wife , that 's what i 'm gon na ask you to do			2
' if you want to do something about it , call the cops , tell them to do it			0
otherwise , leave me alone			0
' indeed , @entity7 is one of 45 states that have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location			2
it is legal to breastfeed in public in all 50 states			0
family values : the @entity11 family have a popular @entity31 channel and @entity122 ( pictured ) on which they document their lives as a family of six after the footage went viral and appeared on @entity47 , the @entity125 of @entity126 released a statement			1
it said : ' @entity125 of @entity6 supports breastfeeding and appreciates recognition of @entity132			0
' the city also supports the law , which states , " a mother is entitled to breast - feed her baby in any location in which the mother is authorized to be			1
" ' today , two women were breastfeeding in or near a public entrance to the city 's recreation center where we were hosting a camp for youth ages 5 - 13 in addition to other recreation center patrons			0
' to be respectful of everyone 's rights we asked the women to cover up			0
there is nothing in the law that prohibits the city from requiring a mother to cover up			2
' we also offered a room in an attempt to be more accommodative			0
the city did not attempt to prohibit breastfeeding and we fully support the freedom of mothers to breastfeed as long as it does n't infringe on someone else 's freedom			0
' mrs @entity11 added : ' this is normal -- this is what breasts are for			1
had [ the manageress ] not made a scene , no one would have known , it was that discreet			0
' i mean the law is there for a reason			0
it 's there to protect us and we need to make sure we are that voice			0
we tell them that 's not okay			0
we can nurse where we need to			0
