it was what you might call drinking in the @entity5 last chance saloon			0
@entity10 , in all likelihood on his way out of @entity9 , was given one final chance to persuade @entity12 to let him stay			1
the fact it was an @entity14 tie against @entity16 opposition in @entity17 , sandwiched between two much more significant and high - profile @entity19 games with @entity21 , said everything about the @entity24 ’s @entity9 career since he arrived 12 months ago			1
he was only on the teamsheet because @entity12 needed to rest his key personnel for tuesday night ’s all - important second leg with the @entity28			0
in normal circumstances , he probably would n’t have made the squad , such are the talents at the manager ’s disposal			0
@entity10 of @entity9 attempts to ride the challenge of @entity17 's @entity35 at @entity5 the relentless pace of fighting for silverware on four fronts , the inescapable need to rotate the players to avoid injury and fatigue seems to be the only way the £ 11m @entity10 can get a game			1
he has played a mere 268 minutes of first - team football this season , spread over seven appearances across all competitions			1
it certainly has n’t worked out the way he planned when he arrived from @entity51 with great fanfare last january			0
including this one , @entity10 has featured in just 18 games for the club			1
during the remaining days of the transfer window , @entity10 will head most likely to @entity58 on loan until the end of the campaign			1
a longer lasting decision will then be made			0
but he was at least granted one last opportunity to show @entity12 - and the @entity9 fans - what they ’d be missing			1
it was certainly more than @entity67 who , like at @entity21 on tuesday , did n’t make the matchday squad			0
@entity17 team - mates enjoy the moment having beaten @entity72 leaders @entity9 in the @entity14 @entity10 has made just 18 appearances for the @entity74 since signing from @entity75 in january 2014 he too is heading for the exit door			1
while @entity12 was insistent in his pre-match comments that it would take a ‘ phenomenal offer ’ to spirit him away - @entity80 are believed to be front - runners - the reality is that @entity67 , just seven months after helping @entity83 to the @entity84 , is out of favour			0
@entity12 ’s follow - up comment that @entity67 needs to start out - performing @entity87 and @entity88 to regain his place sounded ominous indeed			1
anyway , back to @entity10 who , with garish red boots and long sleeves on a nippy january afternoon , set out to prove he still has something to give			1
the initial signs were n’t promising			0
he was crowded out by @entity35 and @entity95 as he tried to make headway down the left and was quickly swapped with @entity98 to take position on the right			0
@entity9 manager @entity12 ca n't hide his frustration during the 4 - 2 defeat to @entity17 on saturday @entity9 led on 15 minutes , @entity103 in the right place to deftly flick home an @entity107 corner			1
the magnificent 6,000 travelling @entity17 fans were silenced - at least temporarily			1
on 25 minutes , @entity10 ’s first involvement of note , though it was n’t particularly positive			2
both he and @entity98 lunged to try and reach @entity111 ’s cleverly threaded through ball			0
@entity98 swung his right leg , @entity10 his left			2
they clashed , the ball went to the goalkeeper			0
@entity98 shot his team - mate a glance of a thousand knives			0
shortly afterwards , he received the ball wide right from a reluctant @entity122 , played it in to @entity123 and then anticipated the return			2
but his next contribution , along similar lines , was good			0
@entity123 emerged from midfield , slotted the ball to @entity10 and , after a second ’s delay , he played the perfect return for the @entity133 to roll the ball in off the post for 2 - 0			1
that was the timing and presence of mind @entity10 was bought for and has so seldom been able to display			2
the @entity24 winger struggled to impose himself against the @entity16 opposition and was replaced @entity142 halved the deficit shortly before the break to ignite the contest again but to judge by @entity10 ’s start to the second period , it was long settled			1
two minutes in and he was showboating , producing a flurry of step - overs , rolling the ball left and right as @entity152 ’ eyes flickered			0
it was nice to watch but totally out of context and there were even a few restless jeers from the crowd before @entity10 passed to @entity98			2
there was one glimpse of the @entity9 bought last year , a purposeful driving run through the middle			2
his pace carried him past three @entity17 players and it led to a chance for @entity107			2
that was more like it			0
@entity12 talks to @entity67 in training last week , with the @entity169 set to leave @entity9 this month and five minutes later , he cut inside well onto his left foot and curled in a shot that went a couple of inches wide of the post			2
he was beginning to be genuinely influential			0
then , with the game still delicately - poised at 2 - 1 , it was suddenly all over			1
the @entity176 went up on the board and @entity10 was replaced by @entity88 , whom @entity12 hoped would supply the class for a decisive third goal			1
there was a smattering of applause for the @entity24 , a few stood in appreciation			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , wore the regretful expression of somebody painfully aware all good things must come to an end .			2

@entity9 lost 2 - 4 at home to @entity16 side @entity17 in the @entity14
@entity10 made a rare start for @entity9 but struggled to impact
@entity10 has made just 18 appearances for the @entity74 since january 2014
the @entity24 showed glimpses of his best in the second - half
he also assisted @entity123 to set up @entity9 's second goal
but he was withdrawn for @entity88 late in the match
@entity10 is expected to secure a loan move to @entity58 until end of season
