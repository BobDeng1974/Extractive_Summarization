wondered about wives : @entity2 rep. @entity1 took issue with a bill that would make all sex without consent a criminal act @entity2 state lawmakers considering a sexual consent law found themselves debating whether sex with an unconscious spouse constitutes rape			1
a measure to require clear consent won early @entity16 approval tuesday , after advocates said @entity2 's current law does n't adequately protect victims			2
however , @entity20 rep. @entity1 of @entity21 said he feared the law would let prosecutors charge a man with sexual assault for having sex with his wife while she 's unconscious			1
@entity1 said sex with an unconscious person on a first date should n't be allowed , but it 's different for long - term relationships			1
' if an individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious ... a prosecutor could then charge that spouse with rape , theoretically , ' @entity1 said in committee tuesday , according to the @entity41			1
' that makes sense in a first date scenario , but to me , not where people have a history of years of sexual activity			0
' other lawmakers said the statute should be clear			0
@entity52 rep. @entity51 of @entity53 says an unconscious person ca n't consent , and sex in that situation is rape			2
sex with an unconscious person ' is rape			2
end of story , ' said @entity51 , a @entity61 from @entity53			0
' let 's make the statute clear			0
let 's not dance around it			0
' advocates for @entity2 's @entity67 say the state 's criminal code for sexual assault needs to be altered to clearly state that sex with an unconscious person is rape			1
the current law begins : ' the victim has not consented and the actor knows the victim is unconscious , unaware that the act is occurring , or physically unable to resist			0
' the bill was introduced by @entity53 @entity80 rep. @entity80			0
taking sides : advocates for @entity2 's @entity67 , like bill sponsor @entity80 , say the criminal code needs clarification			1
but @entity1 wondered in tuesday 's committee session if the change might open a door to prosecution if ' a individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious , or the other way around if that is possible ... ' it 's the ' and ' in the language that appears to concern @entity80			1
she wants to remove ' the victim has not consented , ' according to @entity99			0
' at the end of the day , when we took out that language , if somebody is unconscious you probably should n't attempt to try to have sexual relations with them , ' @entity80 said			0
however , it 's also the word of the law that concerns @entity1 , a public servant elected in 2012 with the help of a pro-business , pro smaller government platform			2
' it looks to me now like sex with an unconscious person is by definition rape , ' @entity1 said			2
' i hope this would n't happen , but this opens the door to it â€” a individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious , or the other way around if that is possible ... ' @entity1 scoffs at the notion of what ' the other way around ' entails , and some gentleman at a dais beside him appear to chuckle , before he continues			1
' but a prosecutor could then charge that spouse with rape , ' he said			0
in the end , the committee voted unanimously , with @entity1 's consent , in favor of moving the bill along			1
seen here with his wife @entity142 , @entity1 -- a vocal proponent of small government elected to the state government in 2012 -- called rape ' abhorrent ' but questioned the wisdom of a law that defines it so unequivocally			1

*representative* @entity1 , a @entity20 from @entity21 , questioned a measure to clarify the state 's criminal code regarding rape
what if an ' individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious , or the other way around -- if that is possible ? ' scoffed @entity1
in the end , the committee voted unanimously -- with @entity1 's consent -- in favor of letting the bill move forward
