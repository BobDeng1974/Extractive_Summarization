by @entity0 published : 02:43 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 1 may 2013 @entity1 has become the first force fit patients with gps tracking devices to save money searching for them when they go missing patients with dementia are to be tagged by the police for the first time in a bid to save time and money when they go missing			1
@entity1 has become the first force to fit pensioners with gps tracking devices and hopes the move will save hundreds of thousands of pounds currently spent on extra staff and helicopters			1
it has bought 15 gps tags which can be worn around a patient ’s neck , clipped to a belt or attached to a set of house keys			1
the device sends details of the person 's location to a website every four minutes			2
as long as the wearer has a mobile signal , they can be located anywhere in the world			2
there are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the @entity40 and the number is expected to rise to more than a million by 2021			1
a number of local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers , but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on such a scheme			1
but critics have branded the move as ' completely wrong '			1
@entity52 , general secretary of the @entity53 , described the policy as ' barbaric '			1
she said : ' i think they should withdraw it straight away			2
trying to equate somebody who has committed a criminal act with somebody who is suffering dementia is completely wrong			1
' i doubt whether anyone in the @entity63 would want their parents dealt with in this way if they were suffering from dementia			1
' ' if you 've got people in the community who are so bad that they are wandering off at night and are not safe , they should be properly cared for , they should n't be tagged			2
' it 's a crude form of monitoring when the issue needs a much more detailed response than this			2
this is a back - of - an - envelope response			2
' the trial will cost the force £ 400 a month , but if successful , will be rolled out across the county , which has a higher than average number of elderly people			1
the @entity86 scheme , as it is known , will be paid for by @entity1 but monitored by @entity87 , a company run by @entity88			1
the devices cost £ 27.50 a month , which includes round - the - clock monitoring			0
a number of local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers , but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on such a scheme sergeant @entity99 , from @entity100 , said : ' the scheme is only costing @entity1 a few hundred pounds but comparing this to police time , resources , potential risk to the missing person let alone the anxiety and worry for their family , it is in my opinion , a few hundred pounds really well spent			1
' @entity113 , of @entity88 , added that the devices give vulnerable people , and their relatives , peace of mind			0
she said : ' hundreds of thousands of people across the country have dementia			1
this solution gives both those with dementia and their families the confidence and reassurance they need			1
' the latest model also allows customers to speak to us directly by pressing a button			0
' this can be used by anyone who wants to maintain their independence , but have the reassurance that someone is always around to help them			0
' but @entity141 , an @entity143 @entity142 councillor who is responsible for adult social care in the region , believes the tracking system could stigmatise dementia patients			1
he said : ' it ’s about getting the balance between a person ’s wishes and imposing a technological solution on them that they may or may not wish to have happened			0
' @entity155 and her mother @entity156 , who has a gps tacking device to locate her when she goes missing dementia sufferer @entity156 , 78 , has been fitted with a gps tracking device because she gets lost so often when out walking			1
the transmitter , known as a @entity162 , is attached to her keys and sends out an update of her position every five minutes			0
if she wanders too far from her bungalow in @entity168 , or suffers a fall , her daughter @entity155 receives a phone call from the @entity172 team			0
mrs @entity155 is also able to log on to her computer or @entity174 to see a map showing her mother ’s exact location			0
mrs @entity155 said the device , supplied by @entity180 ’s assisted technology department , had enabled the great - grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be put in a home			0
she said : ‘ the police once brought her home when she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway			0
she does n’t think there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost			0
‘ one day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search			2
we live near the moors and i was sick with worry			0
’ mrs @entity155 says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives			0
‘ there are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about @entity162 , ’ she said			2
she added : ‘ my mother ’s independence is key to her and i think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings			0
‘ but you have got to be safe at the same time			0
i know my mum would hate being in a home and i believe she would have deteriorated			0
