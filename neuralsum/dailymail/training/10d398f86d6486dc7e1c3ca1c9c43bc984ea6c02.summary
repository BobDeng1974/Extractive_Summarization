one of the consequences of living in our universe - where space and time are linked - is that as you travel faster , time can appear to speed up			1
this theory , known as time dilation , was first postulated by @entity8 in the early 20th century , and has since been proven in a number of experiments			1
but , considering that @entity11 is moving through space , does that mean time for us is travelling faster than someone who is stationary ? the answer is ' yes ' , and by about one second per week			1
but why ? a @entity18 physicist answered a question regarding time dilation on @entity11 ( satellite image shown )			1
they said our motion around the sun and galaxy causes time to slow			1
and even on the planet , the spin of @entity11 changes time for people			1
shown is an image of @entity11 taken by @entity34 's @entity33 satellite in 2012 this question was posed on the website ask a @entity37 , and answered by their resident expert known as ‘ @entity40 ’			2
the ‘ twin paradox ’ is a thought experiment proposed by @entity8 in the early @entity42			0
it is derived from his theory of special relativity			0
@entity8 suggests that the faster you travel , the slower you move through time			2
if one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light , they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity			0
known as ‘ time dilation , ’ this was proven in 1971 with the @entity61 experiment			2
atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes			0
the clocks were found to have ticked differently , proving special relativity			0
the expert says that the spin of @entity11 , its orbit around the sun and the solar system ’s motion around the @entity74 all combine to decrease the time we experience on @entity11			1
this is compared to someone who was stationary as compared to moving at our planet ’s speed			2
on @entity11 itself , the effects of the planet ’s spin on time are not too extreme - although they can be calculated			1
at the poles on @entity11 ’s rotation axis , there is no velocity from the spin of the planet - but at the equator , it ’s about 0.3 miles ( 0.5km ) per second			2
‘ the difference in time experienced between people living in @entity98 ( near the pole ) and people living in @entity101 ( near the equator ) is about one part in a trillion , ’ explained @entity40			0
this ‘ gives those proud @entity105 an extra second every 25 thousand years , ’ they added			0
‘ do n’t spend that second all in one place , @entity105			0
’ around the sun , @entity11 is moving about 18.5 miles ( 30km ) per second , which causes us to lose even more time that we would experience compared to someone moving slower			1
@entity11 's motion around the sun , as it orbits within the solar system ( illustration shown ) is about 18.5 miles ( 30km ) per second , which causes us to lose even more time compared to someone who is stationary our motion around the galaxy , meanwhile , which is about 125 miles ( 200km ) per second , equates to a gain in time of about one part in every 4.5 million , which is an extra second every couple of months			1
and just being in the @entity74 itself , which is travelling through space , also adds some extra time to our everyday life			0
by being in the galaxy and spinning around its centre , we lose roughly a second every week over someone who was floating out in intergalactic space			1
in an email @entity40 , who remains anonymous , told @entity136 added that gravitational time dilation also had an effect , caused by the presence of gravity			2
it should be noted , though , that time is relative and there is no one true clock for the universe			0
this means that no one experiences the ' correct ' time , but each person merely has their own frame of reference to space - time			0
the biggest effect on the time we experience is the motion around the galaxy , which is about 125 miles ( 200km ) per second , and the movement of the @entity74 itself ( shown from @entity11 )			1
with everything combined , we gain approximately an extra second every week , compared to someone who is stationary in the universe			0

a @entity18 physicist answered a question regarding time dilation on @entity11
they said our motion around the sun and galaxy causes time to speed up
and even on the planet , the spin of @entity11 changes time for people
in total , we experience time faster by about one second per week
this is compared to someone floating in intergalactic space
