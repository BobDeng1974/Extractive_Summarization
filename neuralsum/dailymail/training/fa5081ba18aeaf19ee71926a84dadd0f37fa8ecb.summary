by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 ’s biggest brothel spanning nearly 20,000 square feet , costing £ 3.8million and employing nearly 100 working girls is poised to open in @entity4			1
building work is already underway on the ‘ mega bordello ’ as it has been dubbed in the @entity4 media as prostitution continues to flourish in the country where the world 's oldest profession has been recognised since 2001 as a legal one too			2
but for many residents of the city on the border with @entity18 , the house of ill repute is one too many in a community already overflowing with sex parlours			2
red light alert : building work on the brothel in @entity24 is under way the centre - left spd mayoress , @entity26 , is apprehensive of the social strains on the city , stating : ‘ prostitution has assumed unbearable proportions here			1
’ and bemoaning the labyrinthine planning regulations in her homeland , she said : ‘ businesses like this find it is easy to get permission			2
in fact , it is easier to open a brothel in @entity24 than it is a chip shop			1
’ she is calling for the state government to introduce a higher sex tax that would at least pay dividends back into city coffers			2
employer : it 's thought that around 100 prostitutes will work at the hangar - style brothel tentatively named @entity53 , the aircraft - hangar style building is expected to employ at least half its staff from the @entity56 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 prostitutes already operating in other sex establishments in the city			1
@entity24 became a magnet for eastern @entity2 working girls when the @entity61 expanded its borders in 2007			1
there are over 1,000 registered sex workers in @entity24 , which has a population of 170,000 ( stock image ) there are over 1,000 registered sex workers in the city of 170,000 and probably three times that many working under the radar			1
much of the custom comes from @entity18 where official attitudes to prostitution are not as relaxed as in @entity4 and the laws governing it more complex			0
huge number of new customers from the nearby cities of @entity82 , @entity83 and the many small towns in - between are expected to break for the border when @entity53 opens its doors in january 2014			0
@entity87 , media officer of the state of @entity89 in which @entity24 sits , is deluged with media enquiries from newspapers around the world - both about the size of the brothel and the social tensions it is creating			1
’ it is not only about @entity24 , ’ he says , flustered			1
’ this is also a @entity2 problem			0
’ @entity98 , who owns a chain of mega-brothels in @entity4 , and who is politely referred to in newspapers as ' @entity103 ' , is behind the latest project			0
he took full advantage of chancellor @entity107 's government decision back in 2001 giving legal rights to prostitutes to access health , insurance and pension benefits so long as they paid into the tax system			0
‘ this will be a great place for men to relax , ’ he said , preferring to paint a picture of an establishment more in line with a gentlemen 's club than an industrial - scale sex factory			0
but prostitute activist groups representing many of the 400,000 registered hookers in the country , say that pimps and enforced prostitution , particularly among migrants , continues to thrive and that efforts to register prostitution have largely failed			0
saarbruecken residents are fearful of a rise in street crime and violence when the new bordello opens			0
they are also mourning the loss of their city 's once enviable reputation for fine dining and a laid - back way of living .			0

the brothel , being built in @entity24 , will employ nearly 100 working girls
the *controversial* business spans 20,000 feet and will cost £ 3.8million
