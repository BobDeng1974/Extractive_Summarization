@entity55 , said : ' i did n't know there were weapons there until someone told me			0
' he was a bit of a loner and an oddball			0
he never did anyone any harm though			0
' he was taken into care about a month or so ago			0
' another neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ' who would have thought it , hey ? @entity14 seemed alright			1
he was an eccentric but never violent at all			2
' it 's a nice community round here , the sort of last place you would expect to find one gun , let alone 70			2
' clutter : a view through one of the windows of the house , whose owner was described as an avid collector mystery : sussex police have not revealed any more details about the man , including his age or cause of death the weapons have now been catalogued at police headquarters with a green tag attached to each of the guns , which vary massively in shape , size and heritage			2
a @entity83 spokesman said : ' they were reported to us by a relative who was clearing out the house after the man died			1
' sergeant @entity103 added : ' let ’s say it was not our usual day at the office			1
' we were told we might found two or three firearms at the house but were amazed to find 70			2

@entity134 , who is regularly used as a gun expert in court , said : ' as a principle and looking at the number of weapons , i would think that many of the guns would have been collected legally			0
' there are a number of weapons from many different decades , but the majority look to be from the @entity4			2
it would be very difficult for someone to amass a collection of guns that size totally illegally			0

' if one of the revolvers is an antique , that could be worth a thousand pounds on its own			0
