by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 17:49 est , 31 august 2012 what 's the best way to erase an ex-lover from your life ? as @entity9 artist @entity8 found , painting over her is a good start			1
his portrait of this pre-raphaelite beauty ( main picture ) did not always feature the steady gaze of this striking woman with dramatic brows and a tumble of auburn curls			1
the new beauty : @entity21 's face in the finished portrait what lies beneath ? a close inspection revealed the face of the artist 's previous lover previous occupier : the painting used to feature @entity30 before she was painted over some years earlier it was the face of the artist ’s previous lover and model @entity30 , above , smiling out from the painting			1
when she ended her affair with @entity8 in 1859 , the unfinished canvas lay untouched for years until @entity8 fell in love with @entity21 – the woman who would become his wife			1
that ’s when he got the painting out , scraped off @entity30 ’s face and replaced it with @entity21 ’s			1
the secret about - face is revealed in an x-ray released by @entity46 , where the painting will go on display this month as part of the pre-raphaelites : @entity51 exhibition			1
the x-ray was taken during routine cleaning of the painting			1
although @entity8 removed @entity30 ’s face all those years ago , some remnants can still be seen thanks to the fact that he originally painted on to a white background			2
@entity30 ’s mouth is smaller than @entity21 ’s and she has a shorter , rounder nose and less defined jawline			2
experts say , however , that the finished painting of @entity21 still bears @entity30 ’s hands and maybe even hair			2
historians believe @entity8 had intended to marry @entity30 but she was fiercely independent and enjoyed the company of other men too much			2
@entity69 , who along with @entity8 and @entity70 founded the @entity71 in 1848 , is thought to have also been her lover			2
@entity8 ’s wife @entity21 died in childbirth in 1866 – the year the portrait was finally finished			0
first lover : @entity30 in a different painting by the artist hidden face : an x-ray showed she had been painted over the painting , @entity83 far @entity82 , also features a different background arrangement to the original draft , and the artist even sewed an extra piece of canvas on to make it bigger			1
in his memoirs , @entity8 indicated that a third woman – a professional model known only as miss @entity93 – also sat for the piece , but she is not discernible from the x-ray			1
curator @entity96 said : ‘ @entity8 was a sincere and intense man			0
he was attracted to striking - looking women			0
he loved strong independent types			0
‘ when @entity30 left him , he was devastated			0
he was very jealous of her relationships with other artists and quite controlling			0
he put the unfinished portrait aside when it ended and took it up again when he had a new fiancée			0
‘ the painting 's title means “ it is sweet to do nothing “ , so presumably she ’s looking out at someone who is her lover			0
she ’s dallying in front of her betrothed			0
‘ it ’s a picture about acceptance , so it ’s quite understandable that the artist would want to show the woman he wanted to spend his life with			0
’ the exhibition at @entity117 ’s @entity46 begins on september 12 .			1
