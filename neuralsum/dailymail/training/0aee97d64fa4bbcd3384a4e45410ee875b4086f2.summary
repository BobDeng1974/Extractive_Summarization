a woman diagnosed with an advanced hiv infection may have caught it by sharing manicure equipment with a cousin who did n't realise she was @entity1 - positive a 22 - year - old woman was diagnosed with @entity1 after having her nails done using shared manicure equipment			1
doctors say the case , detailed in a medical journal , has revealed a new form of transmission for the virus			2
however the researchers warned that transmission through shared manicure equipment is a ' very rare event ' and the risks of infection from new sources are still very low			1
when diagnosed , the woman was found to have advanced @entity1 , according to the report in the journal @entity23			1
but she had none of the usual risk factors for acquiring the virus , which is most commonly caught by having sex without a condom			1
it can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment , and from an hiv - positive mother to her child during pregnancy , birth and breastfeeding			2
however , the woman did report having shared manicure instruments years before with a cousin who was later found to be @entity1 - positive			1
blood analysis suggested the woman contracted the virus around ten years ago			2
further genetic analysis of the viruses from both patients suggested it came from a common ancestor , indicating the possibility @entity1 was transmitted through the manicure instruments			1
dr @entity51 , of the @entity52 at the @entity53 , said the case should not make people scared of contact with people with the virus , as the risk of infection is very low			2
he said : ' @entity1 is not transmitted by casual contact , such as sharing eating utensils , or drinking from the same water glass			0
' this transmission of @entity1 by shared manicure equipment is a very rare event that should serve not to make people fear @entity1 or contact with @entity1 - infected people			1
' however , the case could promote caution around sharing items which may contain blood , he added			0
he said : ' it should make people aware that sharing any utensils with possible blood - blood contact , such as needles used for drugs , tattoos , or acupuncture can result in transmission of viruses such as hepatitis c ( @entity85 ) and @entity1			0
the hiv virus ( pictured ) is most commonly caught by having sex without a condom			0
it can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment , and from an hiv - positive mother to her child during pregnancy , birth and breastfeeding ' in addition , there are other common viruses and bacteria that can also be spread by sharing equipment without proper disinfection between users			1
' @entity1 is transmitted from one person to another through bodily fluids including blood , blood , semen , rectal fluids , vaginal fluids and breast milk			0
it must enter directly into a person 's bloodstream through an injection with a needle or syringe , or come in contact with damaged tissue , or a mucous membrane			0
mucous membranes can be found inside the mouth , the vagina , the opening of the penis , and the rectum			0
dr @entity128 , medical director at @entity129 , echoed that this is a rare case			0
he said : ' this is a highly unusual case			0
it is often very difficult to be certain as to the source of an hiv infection – especially one that happened over a decade ago – and it is hard to imagine how @entity1 could be caught from manicure equipment			1
' in the @entity140 the vast majority of @entity1 infections are passed on through unprotected sex			2
i do n’t think this single case need change our simple message that the best ways to prevent hiv infection are to use condoms and test regularly for the virus ' .			0

the woman , 22 , was diagnosed with advanced @entity1 virus
she had none of the usual risk factors for the virus , like unprotected sex
she reported having shared manicure equipment with @entity1 - positive cousin
analysis of both patients suggested their virus had a common ancestor
this indicates the hiv was transmitted through the manicure instruments
the case reveals a new form of transmission for the virus , say *experts*
doctors warn this case is extremely rare and risk of infection is very low
