by @entity0 @entity2 's players have been getting to know new boss @entity3 and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits			1
here , @entity6 has exclusive extracts from @entity0 's explosive new book on the @entity9 which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at @entity13			1
they call @entity3 ‘ @entity15 ’ , a moniker that exquisitely sums up his essential @entity9 stubborness			1
the tall , proud figure who is about to take charge of @entity2 believes that the coach is in charge			1
he will lead with the right state of mind and he expects his players to follow suit			1
he ’s always been the same : it was this men tality that brought his success and not the other way round			1
his first big job as head coach of @entity9 giants @entity58 came in september 1991 , a shock appointment when @entity60 went to @entity61 , and the club chose their former youth coach despite a campaign for the return of legend @entity67			1
‘ i sat in my car and suddenly i realised “ i am technical director of @entity58 ”			1
i began sweating profusely , ’ @entity25 revealed in an interview with , of all magazines , @entity70			1
‘ that feeling lasted for only one minute			1
afterwards i never again had that feeling			1
’ certainly his players learned in no time that their new manager would n’t tolerate anybody who broke the rules			1
if anybody arrived just a minute late for training , @entity25 the disciplinarian fined them			1
if it happened again it was doubled			1
a third time and it was doubled again			1
shock appointment : @entity25 's first big job came when he was named @entity58 head coach in september 1991 @entity25 would get irritated over players not putting used towels in the laundry basket in the dressing room			1
if someone threw his towel elsewhere he could take it home and wash it himself			2
another hallmark was that everyone , including the superstars , would lug around the giant cases of equipment and not just the kit man or reserves			2
at press conferences the players invariably appeared in the stiff club suit , with matching tie and shoes			2
the jacket had to be buttoned up			2
he fell out with @entity111 , the 33 - year - old veteran who had been the star of central midfield since @entity67 signed him in 1986 ; he fell out with @entity113 , humiliating the fleet - footed winger in training sessions ; he sidelined @entity116 , who had been part of the furniture for a decade , by moving him to the right wing until the striker announced he no longer wanted to play there			2
it was n’t an instant success			2
@entity25 ’s @entity58 managed just 20 points out of the first 16 games , the supporters lost confidence and calls from the stands for @entity67 to return were mixed with those for @entity25 to go			2
his reaction ? ‘ i will not change my attitude , ’ he said			2
discipline : the @entity2 squad will quickly learn that new boss @entity25 is a strict disciplinarian his confidence was proved right			1
by the end of his first season @entity58 had won the @entity138			2
a bright new team of young players , who had emerged through the system when @entity25 was their youth coach , had begun to take shape			2
players who had learned under his wing such as @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 went on to win the @entity149 in 1995 , only failing to retain the trophy when @entity151 beat them on penalties a year later			2
with @entity25 , there are no half measures			2
people tend to be grouped by him as either friends or enemies			2
all smiles : @entity25 watches on next to a griining @entity46 during a @entity2 training session on saturday @entity161 will continue to spend - @entity162 his second wife @entity163 once worked as a pr manager and so can offer him help on polishing his image , but he is neither bothered nor interested			1
he says : ‘ if i think something unfair is taking place , i react			0
that has nothing to do with respect			0
you can turn it around ; the other person has failed to show respect for me			0
’ those who work for him and follow his lead will tell you he is warm and generous with his time and his conversation			0
but he will cut dead those who take a different path			0
years after his first glory days at @entity58 - when , during a second spell at the club , he was falling out with star players again but this time without the same success - he was asked if he had ever read the book i am always right by the @entity9 author @entity189			1
‘ i know @entity189 , but not that book , ’ replied @entity25			1
‘ a catchy title but i would never say that about myself			0
i would add the nuance : “ i usually am right ”			0
’ there is a saying that nobody gets to know what would have happened			0
that ’s certainly true of @entity3 ’s years as a player			1
he wanted to make it as a star in the @entity58 first team ; his family wanted him to study as a @entity203 ’s certain is that in trying to do both he cost himself the chance of the sort of star career on the field that would match what he later achieved as a coach			0
helping hand : @entity25 's second wife worked as a pr manager and can offer him help on polishing his image just 17 when he enrolled in the @entity215 in the @entity217 suburb of @entity218 , he stuck to his studies even when two years later he was spotted by @entity58			1
they gave him a @entity221 127 to replace his @entity223 moped , but did little else to make life easy over two seasons			0
‘ these were two heavy , hard years , ’ said @entity25 , ‘ because i simultaneously played football and studied to become a pe teacher			0
‘ but my game mentality took shape in those years and that still benefits me			0
you see , playing football well is not enough ; you have to want to win			0
’ youngster : @entity25 stuck to his studies even after he was spotted by @entity9 giants @entity58 in the early 70s if @entity58 formed his football philosophy , his time first studying and then working in schools was also a major influence			1
@entity2 ’s players will find a bit of coach , a bit of social worker , and a lot of school teacher about their new boss			1
he says himself that studying in the @entity215 was where ‘ i learned what makes people tick ’			0
@entity58 and @entity9 manager @entity253 , credited as the architect of total football , was one of his role models because he ’d also experienced life outside the professional game			1
@entity25 said : ‘ @entity253 was a pe teacher first as well			0
players are just like big children			0
so there really is a resemblance between being a teacher and being a coach			0
’ big influence : united players will find a bit of a coach , social worker and school teacher in @entity25 his first taste of the job he dreamed of as manager of his own country ended in failure with a @entity9 squad that imploded and failed even to qualify for the @entity42 in 2002			1
even then , in his own mind , that failure was the fault of the players and not him			0
‘ some of the players refused to accept my methods , ’ he said			0
‘ i am who i am and i have my own ways			0
i ’m not going to change and i have no desire to			0
’ in 2009 , when he started work at @entity289 and results took time to come , it was reported that he had been heard going round the dressing room insisting : ‘ i am like @entity292			0
i never get ill and i am always right			0
’ a few months later , @entity25 put the record straight			0
‘ i am not @entity292 , ’ he said			0
‘ if i were @entity292 i would win everything all the time			0
’ at @entity13 they will have to get used to that			0
assured : during his time in @entity298 , @entity25 compared himself to @entity292 and insisted he was always right adapted from @entity3 by @entity299 , published by @entity300 , price £ 16.99			1
