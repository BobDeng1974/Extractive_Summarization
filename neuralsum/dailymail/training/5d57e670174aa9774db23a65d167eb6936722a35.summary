@entity0 believes @entity1 are several players short of having a squad capable of winning the @entity4 this season			1
after a disastrous campaign in which @entity1 finished seventh under @entity8 , new manager @entity9 has brought @entity10 and @entity11 to @entity12			1
but @entity0 insists they still need a right back and another midfielder before they can claim to be legitimate challengers			1
' although there is a potential with what @entity30 did in the fact they had free weeks of saturday to saturday , continual perfect preparation			0
that 's a big advantage for @entity1 if they get onto some momentum			2
' in @entity43 , [ @entity38 ] @entity37 , [ @entity39 ] @entity40 and [ @entity42 ] @entity41 , they have still got , i think , probably the best strikers in the league as a pool			0
' if they can get the back right and find a solution in midfield – [ @entity50 ] @entity52 's out for two or three months so they need to sign another top midfield player – and stay injury - free then they do have a chance			2
' @entity1 begin their @entity4 campaign at home to @entity58 on saturday			0
@entity59 wants reinforcements sharp shooter : @entity37 has impressed in pre-season following a disappointing @entity63 for @entity64			0

@entity1 have signed @entity11 and @entity10 this summer
@entity9 's side have had an impressive pre-season
but @entity0 believes they are short of a right back and midfielder
@entity12 legend does not think @entity1 are ready to win the league
@entity27 *pundit* does think they have the strongest *attack* , however
