scientists have found the first pieces of space rock that hurtled to @entity3 last week and exploded over a @entity5 city , kickstarting a ' gold rush ' that could see each fragment fetch £ 6,500			1
experts have been scouring a 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of @entity12 , in the @entity13 , believed to have been carved out when the fireball crashed to the ground			1
and after three days of combing the ice for clues , they have finally unearthed fragments of stone which each have a strong magnetic field and emit unusually high traces of radiation - clear signs that it came from space			1
a total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in @entity55 fragments have started to appear on @entity63 , a @entity5 website for classified ads. many pieces were harvested around @entity12 , where more than 1,000 were injured as the meteor disintegrated overhead			1
one user asked for around £ 6,500 for a small piece , while another offered 18 pieces for £ 11 each			2
residents of a village near @entity12 searched the snowy streets , collecting stones they hoped would prove to be the real thing			1
but not all were ready to sell			2
' i will keep it			2
why sell it ? i did n't have a rich lifestyle before , so why start now ? ' a woman in a pink woollen hat and winter jacket , clutching a small black pebble , told state television @entity87 - 24			1
almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the @entity3 's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000mph on friday , blowing out the windows of 900 schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes			2
the debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash			0
on saturday , divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed , leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris			1
worth up to £ 6,500 : these tiny fragments are said to be valuable and some are already being auctioned online after they were found near @entity56 in the @entity12 region of @entity5 terrifying : almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the @entity3 's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph friction : burning from the friction with @entity3 's thin air , the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the @entity5 town of @entity12 as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time on friday			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			1
collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece			0
film director @entity148 is a noted collector			0
in october a 9in piece of the @entity151 meteorite found in @entity152 in 1960 sold in @entity153 for $ 43,750 ( £ 28,200 )			1
astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit @entity157 cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day			0
@entity160 problem : the revelation comes a day after the @entity162 called on the world 's most powerful countries to urgently develop technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten @entity3 @entity169 said that when he meteor entered the atmosphere , it exploded with the force of a nuclear weapon			0
the revelation , based on an analysis of the earth 's rotation , comes a day after the @entity162 called on the world 's most powerful countries to urgently develop technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten @entity3			0
' instead of fighting on @entity3 , people should be creating a joint system of asteroid defence , ' demanded @entity182 , a close ally of president @entity160 and chairman of the @entity5 foreign affairs parliamentary committee			0
he urged the @entity186 , @entity5 and @entity187 to join forces to create an @entity189 , warning this was far more urgent that the @entity186 priority of a @entity193 - based star wars defence system aimed at deterring attacks from rogue states			1
deputy premier @entity196 made clear @entity5 will lead an international drive for such a move			1
' i have already spoken of the need for an international initiative aimed at creating an early warning system that would also prevent extraterrestrial objects from coming dangerously close to the @entity3 , ' he said			0
' @entity204 must create a system to identify and neutralize objects that pose a danger to the @entity3			0
' the disaster in the @entity13 - which led to damage to hundreds of buildings from a ten ton space fireball that had the force of a nuclear bomb - was a wake - up call to the world , which is not ready to cope with the threat , he warned			2
wake - up call : experts said asteroid 2012 @entity219 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system destruction : officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place , @entity5 would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris ' @entity5 and other major countries do have a system of space monitoring and control , but it is mainly geared towards monitoring instances when spacecraft may come dangerously close to space junk , ' he said			1
the key task was ' not waiting for new incidents to happen but handling problems in advance '			0
he called on international players to pull their efforts together instead of ' piling up military stuff in space , aimed only at lowering our planet 's defences '			0
@entity196 expressed the hope this latest incident would make ' officials think of more important issues and look beyond the space horizon '			0
there are some 1,300 space rocks on @entity169 's list of ' potentially hazardous asteroids ' - yet many like the one that struck @entity12 were not tracked in advance			1
@entity12 , 900 miles east of @entity260 and close to the @entity262 border , took the brunt of the impact the @entity186 - based @entity265 , which includes @entity169 veterans , said friday 's close encounters amount to a wake - up call			1
' of the million asteroids as large as or larger than 2012 @entity219 , we have only tracked less than 10,000 , ' said the organisation			0
divers were yesterday scouring frozen @entity33 for remnants of the meteorite that struck on friday with two monumental explosions , as 20,000 emergency workers cleared up the damage from broken glass , collapsed roofs and structural damage to buildings			1
former @entity162 minister @entity282 called for a joint @entity186 , @entity5 and @entity284 initiative			0
' we will clearly have a need to create near - earth stations , with stronger , advanced telescopes , ' he said			2
shockwave : people heading to work in @entity12 , @entity5 , heard what sounded like an explosion , saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the @entity12 and @entity55 regions ' perhaps the calculations might show us that we can even bring nuclear weapons into orbit			1
it is impossible to envisage it now			0
it is a matter of calculations , we need to figure out what needs to be done to detect such meteorites , asteroids , to forecast them coming , to change their trajectory , to destroy them			0
these are tasks for physics and engineering			0
' leading scientist @entity316 stressed : ' it is high time to create a common international centre for monitoring and responding to natural threats from space			2
' the @entity322 should create a special committee within its structure to coordinate efforts			0
' if the meteorite had hit at a different time of day , it could have struck the @entity157 with devastating consequences			2

experts have been scouring 50 - foot hole in a frozen lake near @entity12
stones have magnetic field and emit unusually high traces of radiation
some scientists have questioned if hole was actually made by meteorite
