a handful of active strikers crippled the @entity3 ’s news coverage yesterday despite widespread internal opposition to the walkout			1
@entity10 4 programmes including today , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were replaced with pre-recorded features and short news summaries			2
@entity13 and regional tv news bulletins were hit and @entity15 replaced by @entity16 and @entity17			0
the @entity34 , which called the action in protest at compulsory redundancies , insisted it was well supported			1
but the union was unable to provide figures on how many @entity3 staff joined the walkout and only a dozen strikers manned a picket line outside the @entity45 ’s @entity44 in central @entity46			1
all had left by 5pm			0
picket : journalists at @entity49 are also on strike over job cuts , disrupting programmes throughout today plea : a @entity34 , @entity34 , placard taped to a post outside @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity46 , but very few people were protesting at its doors absent : presenters @entity59 and @entity61 were not on the air today after a strike meant @entity15 was cancelled workers at the @entity65 have voted to go on strike in a row over spending cuts and job losses			1
members of the @entity71 backed walkouts by almost 2 - 1 , and other forms of industrial action by nearly 9 - 1			1
the union said it believed education secretary @entity76 is using the department as an ideological test - bed for wider civil service cuts			0
around 1,000 jobs are under threat because of spending cuts , said the union			0
@entity71 general secretary @entity84 said : ' these cuts are purely political and would not only mean misery for 1,000 of mr @entity76 ’s own staff but also put at risk some vital public services , such as ensuring children are safe at school and supporting special educational needs			2
' the union said turnout in the ballot was 37.5 per cent			0
officials accused the department of using management consultants to draw up plans to axe more than a quarter of its workforce			0
a @entity65 spokesman said : ' we want this country to have the best education system and the best children 's services			2
to achieve this we must create a department that delivers an excellent service to the public , while ensuring value for money for the taxpayer			0
' for most of the afternoon they were outnumbered by about 40 @entity117 solidarity campaigners who hijacked their protest			0
at the @entity3 ’s new @entity121 headquarters in @entity122 , only ten union officials manned picket lines outside three buildings yesterday afternoon			1
one journalist on @entity6 said : ‘ it is an over-the - top reaction for a relatively small number of job losses			0
‘ but there are so many die - hard lefties in senior positions at the @entity3 you ca n’t afford to get on the wrong side of			1
‘ so while we might not actually want to strike , some of us are scared to cross the picket line in case we damage our careers			2
’ according to insiders , the today programme ’s scheduled presenters @entity139 and @entity142 did not threaten to strike and were unhappy with the @entity34 ’s action			1
but editor @entity145 decided over the weekend to cancel the show because he felt he could not guarantee enough staff would turn up to work			2
a senior source said : ‘ the presenters did n’t have to pin their colours on the mast because the decision had already been taken			0
‘ the editor simply took the view that it is sometimes better that there ’s no programme than one that has been cobbled together			0
there ’s a great deal of unhappiness about the strike			2
many , many staff do n’t feel it should be dealt with in this way			2
‘ but it is difficult for people to take a stand against their colleagues and actively break the strike			0
however , if the @entity34 try another one they may well find they are unable to gather enough support to pull it off			0
’ one senior news presenter at the @entity3 said of the decision not to air key news programmes : ‘ there is no real leadership in @entity175 any more			1
' people lost their nerve once the strikes were announced			0
the result has been a shambles			0
’ strike : a man enters @entity44 in @entity46 as @entity3 journalists started a 24 - hour strike today over compulsory redundancies casualty : the industrial action meant that the @entity187 , presented by @entity139 among others , was off the air @entity190 criticised @entity3 staff for striking , pointing out that many of the ‘ well - funded ’ @entity45 ’s employees earn more than his £ 142,000 salary			1
the @entity3 said it was ‘ disappointed ’ with the industrial action , adding that it would not alter the fact that it has to make ‘ significant ’ savings			1
@entity45 , which is cutting around 2,000 jobs under its @entity200 programme , said 554 employees had left as a result of voluntary redundancy , 186 had been redeployed and there have been 153 compulsory redundancies			1
the @entity34 said 4,000 @entity3 employees are members but could not say how many joined the strike			1
@entity34 national executive member @entity209 said the @entity3 ’s policy was ‘ ridiculous ’ because there were many internal vacancies that could be filled by redeploying staff facing redundancy .			1
