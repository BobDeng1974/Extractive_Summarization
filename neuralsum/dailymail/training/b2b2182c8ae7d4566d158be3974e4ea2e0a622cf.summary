@entity8 's attorney asked the all - male court friday to withdraw its dec. 21 ruling , which she called a ' significant blow to gender equality			1
' the court ruled that @entity15 's firing by @entity17 dentist @entity16 might 've been unfair but was n't illegal			1
fired : @entity8 was so attractive , @entity4 dentist @entity16 fired her out of fear she 'd make him want to stray from his marriage hello ladies : despite @entity15 being 21 years younger than him , married , and ' not interested in a relationship , ' @entity16 believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her the court - and specifically justice @entity26 , who penned the decision - ruled firings of employees who are an ' irresistible attraction ' to bosses do not violate the @entity33 because they 're motivated by feelings and emotion , not gender			1
@entity15 's filing says the court erred because her gender played a role in her termination			2
@entity16 said he fired @entity15 because he 'd grown too close to her and worried he 'd try to start an affair			1
the court ruled 7 - 0 bosses can sack employees they see as an ' irresistible attraction , ' even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong			1
talking with @entity49 recently , @entity15 said of the decision , ' i do n't think this is fair			0
i do n't think this is right			0
' an attorney for @entity16 said the decision , the first of its kind in @entity58 , is a victory for family values because @entity16 fired @entity15 in the interest of saving his marriage , not because she was a woman			1
but @entity15 's attorney said @entity4 's all - male high court , one of only a handful in the nation , failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace			1
@entity15 insisted she was never interested in @entity16 romantically , regardless of his own feelings			2
' absolutely not , ' she said			0
' i 'm happily married			2
' content : happily married with children @entity15 said she saw @entity16 as a father figure and had ' absolutely ' no interest in him romantically since @entity16 fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week			1
while her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he could n't look at her without being aroused , @entity15 said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices			1
asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive , @entity15 laughed at the question			0
' i 'm just an ordinary girl , ' she said			0
' just an ordinary mom			0
' her attorney , @entity92 , said , ' these judges sent a message to @entity4 women that they do n't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that @entity4 women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses ' sexual desires			0
if they get out of hand , then the women can be legally fired for it			0
' @entity15 , 32 , worked for @entity16 for 10 years , and he considered her a stellar worker			1
but in the final months of her employment , he complained that her tight clothing was distracting , once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing , according to the opinion			0
he also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying , ' that 's like having a @entity119 in the garage and never driving it			0
' ' that 's like having a @entity119 in the garage and never driving it			0
' @entity16 and @entity15 — both married with children — started exchanging text messages , mostly about personal matters , such as their families			1
@entity16 's wife , who also worked in the dental office , discovered the messages and demanded @entity15 be fired			1
the @entity131 consulted their pastor , who agreed that terminating @entity15 was appropriate			0
@entity16 fired @entity15 and gave her one month 's severance			1
he later told @entity15 's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her			0
family man : @entity16 's wife , who also works in the dental office , demanded @entity15 be fired when she discovered text messages ordinary mom : @entity15 has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path @entity15 was stunned because she viewed the 53 - year - old @entity16 as a father figure and had never been interested in starting a relationship , @entity92 said			1
@entity15 filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination , arguing @entity16 would n't have terminated her if she was male			2
she did not allege sexual harassment because @entity16 's conduct may not have risen to that level and did n't particularly offend her , @entity92 said			1
however , it has been revealed @entity16 sent @entity15 raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she ' experiences orgasms			1
' ' the motives behind dr. @entity16 terminating mrs. @entity8 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			2
@entity16 argued @entity15 was fired not because of her gender , but because her continued employment threatened his marriage			2
a district judge agreed , dismissing the case before trial , and the high court upheld that ruling			0
@entity26 noted that @entity16 had an all - female workforce and @entity15 was replaced by a woman			2
he said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner 's family			0
one such case from the 8th @entity181 upheld a business owner 's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage			0
in that case , the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct			0
jurisprudence : justice @entity26 penned the @entity4 's decision on @entity16 's dismissal of @entity8 @entity26 said allowing @entity15 's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender			1
@entity16 's attorney , @entity205 , said the court got it right			2
the decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination ; in this case , by allowing @entity16 to honor his wife 's wishes to fire @entity15 , he said			1
@entity16 is a very religious and moral individual , and he sincerely believed that firing @entity15 would be best for all parties , he said			2
' while there was really no fault on the part of mrs. @entity8 , it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman , ' he said			0
' the motives behind dr. @entity16 terminating mrs. @entity8 were quite clear : he did so to preserve his marriage			2
' i do n't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all			0
in my view , this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law			0

a lawyer for @entity8 on friday asked the @entity4 to void its dec. 21 ruling
@entity4 ruled 7 - 0 @entity16 legally dismissed @entity15
