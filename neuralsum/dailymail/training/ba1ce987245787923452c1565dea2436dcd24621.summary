by @entity0 drugs used to treat @entity3 could be used to treat multiple sclerosis , new research suggests			1
researchers found that people infected with hiv infection have a significantly lower risk of developing the debilitating nerve condition			0
they say chronic dampening down of the immune system as a result of @entity3 - or the antiretroviral drugs used to treat - it could be the reason behind the lowered risk			1
multiple sclerosis - caused by the body 's own defences attacking myelin , the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres ( pictured ) - could be treated with @entity3 drugs , new research suggests the @entity24 said that while much more research is needed into the subject , the study shows that that antiretrovirals could be a potential future option for treatment for ms. the condition is caused by the body â€™s own defences attacking myelin , the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres			1
as myelin is stripped away , nerve impulses can no longer be transmitted properly leading to symptoms ranging from mild tingling to full - blown paralysis			0
the condition can cause attacks or relapses that may lead to progressive loss of physical skills , sensation , vision , bladder control , and intellectual abilities			0
drugs that dampen the immune system can slow early forms of the disease , but little can be done for patients in the later stages			2
antiretroviral medications ( pictured ) - may be one reason why @entity3 patients are less likely to develop @entity5 in the new study , researchers from @entity61 , the @entity62 and the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , examined more than 21,000 @entity3 - positive patients treated in hospitals in @entity69 between 1999 and 2011			1
they then compared them to more than five million control subjects			0
their study , published in the @entity73 , found that those with @entity3 were 62 per cent less likely to develop @entity5 than the controls			2
the authors wrote : ' hiv infection is associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing ms. ' mechanisms of this observed possibly protective association may include immunosuppression induced by chronic hiv infection and antiretroviral medications			0
' commenting on the study , dr @entity85 , research communications manager at the @entity24 , said : ' this is a valuable and intriguing new study , and the first to show a significant link between @entity3 and a reduced risk of @entity5 ' much more research is needed to definitively prove whether having @entity3 or being treated for @entity3 with antiretrovirals - or even a combination of the two - reduces the risk of someone developing ms. ' we know that people with @entity5 want new , effective treatments and this study provides some encouragement that antiretrovirals could be a potential future option			1
she added : ' clinical trials are the only way to determine this and the good news is there is a @entity110 - based trial ongoing which is aimed at testing one such drug			0

@entity3 patients are ' 62 per cent less likely to develop multiple sclerosis '
chronic dampening down of the immune system as a result of @entity3 - or the antiretroviral drugs used to treat - it could be reason behind lowered risk
@entity5 *experts* described the new study as ' valuable and intriguing '
