the 37 - year - old @entity12 woman was rescued within 15 minutes and taken to the city 's @entity22 for treatment , where she remained in a stable condition today			2

@entity33 : coastguards and police today hunt for a nine - day - old baby who fell into a @entity38 with his mother off a ferry last night but after a complex police investigation , which included interviewing the woman 's family , officers said they no longer believe a child was in her care at the time			1
a @entity49 spokesman said : ' police have called off the search operation in @entity12 which began yesterday evening after a report that a baby had gone into the water with a woman who was later rescued			1
' following an extensive search operation involving several agencies and volunteers and after enquiries with the 37 - year - old woman and her family , police now understand the report of a baby going into the water was incorrect			1
' police do not believe there was a baby in the woman 's care on the ferry			1
the woman , who is from @entity12 , remains in a stable condition in hospital			2

this morning helicopters , boats and divers continued to scour a large area of @entity12 , close to @entity84 , @entity85 , as they resumed their search for the child			2
a spokesman for the @entity90 @entity89 said : ' it 's very difficult to put a figure on the rescue because we have volunteers and people sitting in operations as well			0
' generally speaking it would have been thousands of pounds , but generally we would never put a value on a human life and we would put in all the resources we thought were necessary for a given situation			0
' the mother , who was from @entity104 , was traveling on a @entity105 when she fell into the water			0
@entity33 : coastguard continue with their major search today for a missing nine - day - old baby who fell from a ferry probe : coastguard search for a baby who fell into the water from a ferry			1
