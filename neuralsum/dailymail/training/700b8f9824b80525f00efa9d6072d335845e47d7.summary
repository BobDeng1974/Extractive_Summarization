by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 10 september 2012 updated : 19:33 est , 10 september 2012 career women who have a ‘ compulsion ’ to juggle a demanding job with being a domestic goddess are putting a strain on their marriages , according to an agony aunt			1
@entity8 believes some women put too much pressure on themselves to deliver at home and in the office and are reluctant to share the household chores with men			1
miss @entity8 , 78 , the agony aunt on @entity16 ’s @entity15 , says that although careers have made women more independent and financially secure , and have freed them from some unbearable marriages , the result is that their world is more stressful			1
domestic goddess : agony aunt @entity23 says women working and being a domestic goddess can put a strain on their marriage ‘ careers have given women independence , but gone is the tranquil world my mother knew , ’ she writes in an article for the @entity29			1
‘ in most two - career homes , it is women who still bear most of the domestic responsibility			1
‘ and not always because the man is lazy – there is an in - built compulsion in some women to remain domestic goddesses while holding down a demanding job			2
’ she describes how she grew up with very happily married parents and says that although they encountered many problems including business failure and the death of a child , her parents ’ love for one another ‘ sustained them ’			2
she reveals how each morning as her father left for work ‘ they would cling together in the hall , as if he were going to another continent ’			0
she adds : ‘ my sister and i would jeer from the stairs and call out “ @entity62 ” but we liked it all the same			0
’ miss @entity8 says modern couples can leave a marriage with greater ease if it is not working			1
but many are also guilty of being unwilling to work as hard to keep their marriages strong			0
she writes : ‘ why do so many marriages break down ? ‘ if i am right in thinking marriages in previous generations endured because the woman , in particular , had no means of escape , it was inevitable that women ’s hard - won economic independence would make them unwilling to stay in an arrangement that had become unbearable			2
‘ men , too , have been liberated from feeling they must stay because they are the sole breadwinner			0
perhaps marriage breaks down more often today because we do n’t work hard enough to keep it together			0
‘ leaving simply because you can is defeatist and if our new independence makes us less likely to see marriage as a life - long commitment , that is sad			0
’ career driven : agony aunt says although careers have made women more independent , their world has become more stressful miss @entity8 , who has been married three times and widowed twice , also criticises the trend for co-habiting , writing : ‘ what i do n’t understand is the present reluctance to commit to marriage while entering into the much greater commitment of parenthood			1
“ i do n’t feel we need this bit of paper , ” they tell me			0
‘ but a marriage ceremony is much , much more than a bit of paper			0
a wedding lets you tell the world , ‘ ‘ we belong together ’ ’			2
’ the full interview with @entity8 is in this week ’s @entity29 .			1

while careers have made women more independent , their world is more stressful , says @entity8
