as manager of @entity2 , @entity0 has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players			1
growing up watching @entity5 , he was less forgiving			2
' i remember @entity7 and @entity8 coming in for stick , ' he recalled			2
' as a teenager i used to get into fights because of it			2
' i remember standing at the back of @entity5 kop , maybe i was 15 or 16 year old and @entity7 and @entity8 were getting booed			1
@entity7 had just taken over from @entity15 and it was boooooo … @entity2 manager @entity0 has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters @entity19 , the @entity2 captain , was booed for an error that led to a goal against @entity22 @entity0 hopes that for the time that he is manager of @entity2 , @entity19 will be the last player to get booed ' they had a song for @entity8 and it went : ' @entity8 , @entity26 ' and half of them would then shout : 's * * t ' and this is while he was warming up for the game			1
' that 's when i got into fights , with the people shouting s * * t. ' tell me , how 's that going to help any individual when that 's the reaction to their name just being read out ? ' those sour memories returned last weekend when @entity2 skipper @entity19 was the object of frustration from the @entity44 stands			1
culpable for a @entity22 goal , the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters			1
he was hardly the first to suffer that fate			2
so long as @entity0 remains manager of @entity2 – an unknown currently – he hopes @entity19 will be the last			1
' i 've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time , that 's fine			1
' but i think the individual thing is not on			2
it was sad to hear last week			0
' the good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again			1
' we were losing 2 - 0 and i think people thought : ' you know what , we need to help the team			0
' it spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping			1
' if it had n't turned itself round , i do n't think we would 've got back in the game			2
' in the west of @entity76 , grown men rarely express their feelings			1
to sympathise would only have drawn attention to the captain 's predicament			2
@entity19 has made no reference to the incident to @entity0 and vice versa			1
' he just wants to get on with it , ' added the manager			0
' there 's not a lot you can say anyway			0
' i remember a situation with @entity91 at @entity92			0
i had to put out a message saying : ' lay off			0
' he ended up with 27 goals and player of the year			0
' it does n't help anybody if a player is booed			2
yes , we all understand and accept frustration in the stands			0
but booing one of your own players is n't going to help			0
' i fully accept that when you boo your team at half time and full time that 's everyone 's prerogative			0
but it 's certainly not going to help anyone by scapegoating an individual			0
' is it going to make him feel good and feel like he 's going to flourish or is he going to go into himself ? surely that 's common sense			0
' should @entity19 play against @entity119 at @entity120 on saturday – and the indications are he will – the defiant , thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response			1
such is the must - win nature of the game and the raucous @entity128 atmosphere that an exaggerated show of support is likely			0
@entity0 expects the 36 - year - old - a strong , experienced footballer - to be fine			0
' @entity19 has a leadership mentally and he has been about			1
it 's good he 's not one of the younger ones			0
' he 's had highs and lows and he 's been there and seen it and represented @entity2 terrifically well in his career			1
' hopefully that 's it and , although it happened , the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better			1
' the need for @entity2 to find some unity at @entity120 is obvious enough			1
they must beat champions @entity119 and hope @entity150 – yet to beat @entity151 this season – show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark			1
if @entity2 do attain second place , it means two less play - off games			1
perhaps more importantly it also avoids another trip to the artificial pitch of @entity161 where they have already lost 2 - 0 and 3 - 0 this season			0
' whoever gets @entity161 will have a hard game , ' said @entity0			0
' we lost down there twice , but we did beat them once at @entity44 and drew with them , too			0
' if we have to go down there , we would be confident because we would have to play them at a full @entity44 as well , which would give everyone a huge lift			2
' they have done really well and had two good results against us , but if we play @entity161 and @entity150 - or just @entity150 - they will be tough games			2
' we 've obviously got to win to get second and that 's what we 'll try to do			0
obviously , there is a slight advantage to finishing second with playing two less games			0
but when it comes down to it , you are just going to have win football games			0
@entity19 is in line to play for @entity2 against league leaders @entity119 at the weekend @entity0 questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team ' if we manage to win at @entity119 and @entity150 do n't win , there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we wo n't have achieved anything			1
' we 've got into the play - offs but , either way , all the hard work is in front of us			2
' we 're aiming to win on saturday , we think we can win , but i just really want a good , strong performance to go into the play - offs			1

captain @entity19 was booed by @entity2 supporters last weekend
