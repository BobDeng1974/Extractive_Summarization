by @entity0 published : 09:03 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 28 november 2012 seen this before ? many have been annoyed by the amount of nuisance texts promising payment protection insurance refunds a marketing company that sent millions of illegal texts encouraging @entity8 to claim compensation for @entity10 or accidents has become the first to be fined			1
the @entity12 has ordered the owners of @entity14 to pay £ 440,000 after they plagued the public with up to 900,000 unlawful spam texts per day over three years			1
owners @entity17 and @entity19 were making up to £ 7,000 a day from selling the details of those who replied to other companies			1
other firms sending similar texts or phone messages have been warned they may be next as the @entity12 is receiving tens of thousands of complaints from the public			2
information commissioner , @entity28 , said : ' the public have told us that they are distressed and annoyed by the constant bombardment of illegal texts and calls and we are currently cracking down on the companies responsible , using the full force of the law			1
' the two individuals we have served penalties on today made a substantial profit from the sale of personal information			1
they knew they were breaking the law			0
' our message to the public is that if you do n’t know who sent you a text message then do not respond , otherwise your details may be used to generate profits for these unscrupulous individuals			0
' examples of the text messages sent out by @entity14 included : ' @entity54 you may be entitled to £ 3500 for the accident you had			1
to claim free , reply claim to this message			2
to opt out text stop			0
another was : ' urgent ! if you took out a @entity60 prior to 2007 then you are almost certainly entitled to £ 2300 in compensation			1
to claim reply ‘ @entity63 ’			2
' the monster fine came following an 18 - month investigation into the activities of @entity14			1
money - maker : these companies bombard people with texts and those who reply they then try to extract personal information that can help them make huge profits the company was sending huge volumes of unsolicited text messages from offices in @entity78 and @entity79 , without the consent of the recipient and without identifying the sender - both of which are legal requirements			1
any replies were then used to generate leads that were sold to other companies at a considerable profit			2
the @entity12 ’s investigation included raids at the company ’s @entity78 premises , in august 2011 , and the @entity95 home of @entity17 , in february this year			2
phone owners should also not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many the evidence obtained showed @entity103 was using unregistered pay as you go sim cards to send out as many as 840,000 illegal text messages a day with an income of £ 7,000 - £ 8,000 a day			1
@entity17 has now been ordered to pay a penalty of £ 300,000 , while @entity19 , who appears to have taken less out of the business , has been fined £ 140,000			1
the @entity12 has connected the company to over 400 complaints to its office about spam texts linked to @entity103			2
if you receive a text from a company you know , or from an anonymous five digit short code , you can prevent any repeat by replying with the word ' stop '			0
if the text message is from an unknown company , or from an organisation you are not familiar with , the telecoms watchdog @entity124 recommends that you do not reply			0
responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages , or even voice calls			0
instead , you should report the text to your network operator , which may be able to prevent further messages from the originating number			0
if the texts continue , complain to the @entity12 – http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113			0
to stop unwanted sales calls , register your phone number – either landline or mobile – with the @entity138 on its website http://www.tpsonline.org.uk or 0845 070 0707			0
this service is free and takes some 28 days for the ban to come into effect			0
alternatively , some telephone companies offer services to block unwanted calls			0
for example , @entity146 offers ' privacy at home ' , ' choose to refuse ' and ' @entity150 ' .			0
