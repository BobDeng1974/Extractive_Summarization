by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:10 est , 15 november 2013 it is often called the best kept secret in the @entity4 - company shares that come with lucrative perks			1
from discounted theme park tickets to @entity8 shopping vouchers , firms are ramping up the freebies they hand out to small shareholders			1
investors in luxury goods group @entity12 can get up to a fifth off its wares – potentially saving £ 300 on a £ 1,500 designer handbag			0
incentive : anybody who holds 250 shares in @entity12 can get 10 per cent off purchases worth more than £ 500 more than 40 companies listed on the @entity22 now offer such perks , according to @entity24			1
@entity25 , head of equities at the stockbroker , said the trend became particularly popular in the 1990s			0
he said : ‘ companies jumped on the bandwagon as a means of getting to their shareholder base - after all , it is likely that a shareholder of the company will also be a customer			2
’ even though the perks culture peaked before the turn of the century , many companies still offer enticements to investors , he added			1
the most recent example is @entity44 , which owns attractions across the @entity46 including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50			0
the company floated last week , and anyone buying more than 1,000 shares - which cost around 348p each – is entitled to a 30 per cent discount on up to two annual passes which give unlimited entry to the firm ’s 31 @entity46 attractions			2
but companies differ in how many shares are required to gain the extras			2
groups such as @entity8 , @entity62 and @entity63 say their discounts are open to all shareholders			2
others require a minimum level of investment , and place conditions on the benefits			2
high street clothing giant @entity71 requires investors to own 500 shares , which currently have an eye - watering total value of £ 27,475 , to be able to claim its 25 per cent discount – and the offer lasts only between april and the end of october , so can not be used in the @entity80 rush			1
larger size clothing retailer @entity81 , which trades under brand names including @entity84 and underwear label @entity85 , increases the discount shareholders can claim based on the number of shares they own			1
other companies offer more unusual rewards			1
@entity93 says its shareholders are entitled to go on a two - day annual visit each december to its sites around the country			0
anyone holding more than 250 shares - worth around £ 2,400 - in pubs and brewing group @entity101 can get a 10 per cent discount when booking to stay in any of its venues , with further offers on its food and drink			0
@entity110 owner @entity108 offers credit that can be spent on board its cruises , but investors still have to pay full whack when booking their holiday			0
others , such as chocolatier @entity118 or @entity122 ’s owner @entity120 , say they offer discounts periodically to investors			0
but the cost of offering such jaunts and freebies has led some firms to roll back the offers			0
@entity129 used to give a discount of 10 per cent for shareholders of its parent company @entity132 - but the scheme is under review and the company last night could n’t say whether it would continue			1
mr @entity25 warned that ‘ perks are not a reason to buy shares ’ and investment decisions should be based on key measures such as dividend and capital growth .			0

more than 40 companies on the @entity22 offer perks
some for all shareholders , but others require *substantial* investments
vouchers , *cheaper* *tariffs* and discount theme park tickets are among them
