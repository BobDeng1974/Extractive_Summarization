@entity1 ambassador @entity0 believes @entity3 's decision to introduce double training sessions could be the reason behind the club 's injury crisis			1
@entity8 has been unable to call on the services of several first team stars during the course of the season due to muscular injuries and @entity0 believes there is a reason behind the problem			1
@entity0 , speaking to @entity17 ahead of @entity1 's @entity19 clash against @entity20 , said : ' i do n’t think you can ever say you ’re unlucky when you ’re getting a lot of injuries			1
i think , when you ’re a coach , you ’ve always got to assess [ why they ’re happening ]			0
@entity1 stars including @entity27 and @entity28 have missed parts of the season @entity3 could be to blame for @entity1 's poor injury record , according to @entity0 ' @entity1 had a long pre-season and they came back with quite a few injuries			1
maybe it was because of the travelling and everything they got a lot of muscle injuries early on in the season and i think he [ @entity3 ] had to adjust his training a little bit but he did want to do double sessions which the players , under sir @entity46 , were not used to			2
' so maybe it ’s because of those double sessions players have picked up muscle injuries			0
the only way you can say you ’re a little bit unlucky is if you ’re getting twisted ankles like @entity55 and @entity56 , they got ankle injuries and there is nothing you can do about that			0
' when you ’re getting a lot of muscle injuries yourself and your staff have definitely got to look at your training and see if you ’ve got to adjust to make sure you can get your best players out on the pitch			0
' @entity8 said before his side 's home match against @entity20 that he is finally seeing ' @entity69 ' regarding @entity1 's injury problems this season			2
the @entity72 will be without just four senior squad members for the match against @entity20 with @entity27 , @entity56 , @entity75 and @entity76 unavailable for selection			0
@entity76 will miss @entity1 's match against @entity20 due to an injury he sustained against @entity80			2

@entity0 has *questioned* @entity3 's coaching *methods*
@entity1 's season has been *hampered* by several muscular injuries
@entity8 believes there is ' @entity88 ' as @entity1 will be without just four players against @entity20
