by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:21 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 28 may 2013 he spoke out earlier this month to slam @entity3 allowing so many children and young wannabes to audition for @entity7 's @entity6			1
but the music mogul used monday night 's live semi final of his @entity11 show to take numerous swipes back at @entity13 for his comments			1
@entity3 seemed to believe he had proved why children should be allowed on his shows after some talented youngsters returned to impress the four judges			2
but as far as sir @entity13 is concerned , they should remain watching @entity7 ’s @entity6 rather than taking part in it			1
the 85 - year - old tv veteran attacked @entity3 for allowing youngsters to take part in his @entity11 show claiming it is an ‘ ordeal ’ for many of them and results in many of them crying			1
‘ i do n’t think that ’s entertainment , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t think they should put children on that are too young			0
’ sir @entity13 , who plans to return as presenter of @entity22 – the @entity58 ’s rival to another @entity3 show , @entity59 – in the autumn , added : ‘ if you ’re going to do that , have a separate show			1
have a children ’s show , @entity7 children have talent			0
’ although @entity3 has ignored @entity13 's comments and used monday night 's live programme to smugly show off the youngsters on this year 's series			1
lengthy tenure : sir @entity13 has hosted @entity22 for 10 years since its inception when @entity31 dance troupe @entity30 returned on stage @entity3 could n't wait to take a dig at @entity76			1
branding the tv veteran mr grumpy he said : ' someone , mr @entity79 , said we should n't have children your age on the show so what do you think yes or no you should be here ? ' the dancers of course screamed yes in unison as they happily got sent on their way with four thumbs up from @entity3 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			2
could n't decide : the judges could n't agree on whether to send through @entity30 or @entity26 so it was sent it to the public vote overcome : 11 - year - old @entity26 became the second act to go through as the judges took their decision to the public vote stars in the making : while the rest of contestants were sent home , the two most popular will go through but @entity3 took another chance to make a more obvious dig at @entity13 later in the show when it was 11 - year - old singer @entity26 's turn to have another audition			1
the young singer wowed the crowd and judges , even receiving a standing ovation for her talents as she belted out a risky @entity120 number			0
and @entity3 made a jibe as soon as he could : ' i think it was one of the best performances of the night and i 'd like to dedicate this one to @entity13			1
' tough job : after the opening act , the judges looked a little hesitant about what was to come dance troupe : @entity130 looked very vibrant in their multi-coloured stage attire earlier this month @entity132 , a charity that campaigns for family - friendly media , backed sir @entity13 and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in tv talent shows			1
the criticisms emerged as one particular installment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five			2
many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much			0
one young girl in dance troupe @entity149 , comprising 13 five to eight - year - olds , started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round			0
stole the show : @entity154 blew away the judges as she sang @entity156 during the first @entity7 's @entity6 live semifinals on monday emotive performance : 11 - year - old @entity26 silenced the crowd as she started singing blown away : @entity3 admitted that he adored the youngster 's performance , singling her out as a frontrunner confident performance : despite her young age , the star in he making had amazing stage presence @entity30 , 33 children aged between seven and 14 from @entity31 also took part , with many of them becoming emotional at the end			1
@entity174 teenagers @entity175 , 13 , and @entity176 , 14 , gave an impressive rendition of @entity178 ’s hit @entity179 but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel ’s verdict			0
even @entity3 acknowledged their performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of them on the show , which topped tv ratings , attracting more than ten million viewers – three million more than @entity58 rival @entity190			2
distressing : @entity191 cries during the semi-final of @entity7 's @entity6 in 2009 after @entity3 chooses dance troupe diversity over her not child 's play : singer @entity195 breaks down crying half way through her song during @entity7 's @entity6 in 2009 ‘ people are so careful about using animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what we expose children to			1
’ scenes of children breaking down in tears have become all too common on @entity207 , with sir @entity13 recalling how one girl of 11 was left in tears			1
a spokesman for the show said : ' the welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our programmes			0
' children are accompanied by a member of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on hand at all auditions			0
' we also employ registered chaperones at our judges ’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children ’s welfare			0
' as there are a limited number of performances @entity7 ’s @entity6 does not have an age limit			0
' all too much : a young contestant in tears on saturday night 's show feeling the pressure : dance troupe @entity149 looked nervous hundreds of viewers complained in 2009 when two child singers , @entity195 and @entity191 , cried due to the pressure of performing live			1
and last year @entity7 ’s @entity6 had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine - year - old @entity248 broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of nerves			0
last month child welfare campaigners questioned whether five - year - old @entity253 should have been put through to the next round			0
while the youngster , from @entity257 , received positive comments from the judges , there were concerns that he is too young to cope with fame , should he progress to the final stages of the competition			2
@entity253 , dressed in a black baseball cap and a t - shirt with his name on it , performed an impressive dance routine and was given a ‘ yes ’ by all four judges			0
but viewers called the decision ‘ inappropriate ’ and called on @entity11 to bring in new rules to ‘ stop this happening ’			0
questionable taste : @entity3 ( right ) kissing @entity95 during this weekend 's show			2

sir @entity13 said @entity3 should *launch* a ' @entity277 '
on young , crying performers : ' i do n't think that 's entertainment . '
@entity3 smugly *enjoyed* the talent of the young acts on monday night 's live semi-final of @entity207 and hit back at @entity13 's comments
