dementia could soon be treated with a ' brain pacemaker ' inserted directly into the skull , according to new research			1
scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation ( @entity8 ) , a technique already used to treat parkinson 's disease , can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed			1
a ' pacemaker ' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull			2
deep brain stimulation is already used to treat @entity17 's , but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia ( file image ) experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall , and it is hoped the same will apply to humans			1
the device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain and has also been shown to provide benefits for a range of conditions including chronic pain , major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder			0
the device was implanted into middle aged rats , sending out minute electrical impulses , and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated , even after 24 hours			0
professor @entity45 , of @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' extensive studies have shown that rats ' brains and memory systems are very similar to humans			0
' the electrodes are harmless to the rats , as they go on to live normally and fulfil their regular adult lifespan of around 22 months			0
' @entity8 is a surgical procedure that has become an established @entity58 treatment for @entity17 's sufferers whose condition does not respond to drugs			1
tests on lab mice showed improved memory within just 24 hours , while the rodents ' life - spans were unaffected ( file image ) now the new research , published in the journal @entity70 , has discovered it could also be used to enhance the growth of brain cells which relieves the harmful effects of dementia related conditions and improves short and long term memory			1
it found new brain cells , or neurons , can be formed by stimulating the front part of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex which is involved in memory retention using minute amounts of electricity			1
the increase in brain cells reduces anxiety and depression , promotes improved learning , and boosts overall memory formation and retention			2
prof @entity45 said : ' the findings from the research clearly show the potential of enhancing the growth of brain cells using deep brain stimulation			1
' around 60 per cent of patients do not respond to regular anti depressant treatments and our research opens new doors for more effective treatment options			0
' prof @entity104 , of @entity105 , @entity106 , who worked on the project while he was at @entity46 , said @entity8 brings multiple benefits			0
he said : ' no negative effects have been reported in such prefrontal cortex stimulation in humans and studies have shown that stimulation also produces anti depression effects and reduces anxiety			0
' memory loss in older people is not only a serious and widespread problem , but signifies a key symptom of dementia			0
' at least one in 10 people aged 60 and above in @entity47 suffer from dementia and this breakthrough could pave the way towards improved treatments for patients			0
' for decades , scientists have been finding ways to generate brain cells to treat brain trauma and injury , and age related diseases such as dementia			1
as part of a natural cycle , brain cells constantly die and get replaced by new ones			2
the area of the brain responsible for generating new brain cells is known as the hippocampus , which is also involved in memory forming , organising and retention			2
by stimulating the prefrontal cortex , new brain cells are formed in the hippocampus although it had not been directly stimulated .			2

deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes inside the skull
technique is already used to help treat diseases such as @entity17 's
scientists think it could help delay dementia by replenishing brain cells
