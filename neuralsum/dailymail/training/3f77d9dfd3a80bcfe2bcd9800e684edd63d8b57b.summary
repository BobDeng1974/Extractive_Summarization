by @entity1 reporter scientists may have found a way to banish flu , after developing a drug that saw mice unaffected by lethal doses of the virus			1
the drug blocks a molecule called @entity11 , and saw mice survive a dose of @entity13 – also known as swine flu - after administration			1
this could see development of a pill to beat flu in humans , an illness which kills thousands every year			1
soon just a memory ? : the new discovery means that science is one step closer to developing a pill against flu it is hoped that the drug which blocked @entity11 in mice could also block the molecule in the human body			1
the @entity31 estimates that up to 49,000 people die from flu - related illnesses every year			0
in 2009 alone , up to 575,000 people died from swine flu ( @entity13 )			2
emerging strains continually threaten to spread to humans and cause even deadlier pandemics			0
the new finding published in the journal @entity41 paves the way for an urgently needed therapy that is highly effective against flu and maybe other viral infections			0
‘ drugs that specifically target @entity11 pathways have already been developed and tested in animals , so our results have excellent potential for clinical translation , not only for the treatment of influenza , but other viral respiratory infections that interact with similar host immune pathways , ’ author of study dr @entity47 , of @entity49 , @entity50 , said			2
mice genetically engineered to lack the @entity63 ) molecule were more resistant to flu infections than others and the vast majority survived after being injected with a deadly dose of @entity13			1
scientists in @entity50 , @entity68 found that by blocking a molecule called @entity11 , mice survived lethal doses of @entity13 , also known as swine flu similarly , mice treated with a compound that blocks @entity11 showed enhanced antiviral immunity and produced better survival rates following infection with the lethal shot compared with untreated animals			1
in spite of the worldwide use of vaccination and other antiviral interventions , flu remains a persistent threat to human health			0
by inhibiting a molecule called @entity88 ( cyclooxygenase ) , ibuprofen and other @entity91 ( nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs ) lower the production of the five prostanoids such as @entity11 , immune molecules that contribute to pain and fever			2
@entity98 , a phd student in dr @entity47 ’s lab who led the study , said : ' but since these drugs inhibit all prostanoids , each may contribute differently towards the immunity against influenza virus			0
understanding their individual role is crucial in developing a new therapy			0

scientists found that blocking molecule builds resistance against flu
mice which had @entity11 blocked were likely to survive deadly dose of @entity13
if *transferrable* to humans , an *anti-flu* pill could be developed
