a first world war seamstress flirted with soldiers on the front line by sewing romantic poems into their kilt linings , it has emerged			1
a note with a three - line poem , followed by an address , was found attached in an heirloom which had been passed down for generations without being discovered			1
after some of the stitches were unpicked from the garment - which was meant to be sent to @entity15 soldiers in the field but never made it - the note dropped out			2
hidden message : this @entity21 kilt had a flirty note sewed inside of it , from a seamstress who referred to herself as @entity25 , and left her address ' if single drop a line ' : the message , which rhymes in parts , imagines the handsome soldier in his kilt and suggests he get in touch - as long as he is n't married it imagines the soldier looking handsome in uniform and suggests that he gets in touch with the seamstress , identified as @entity25 - unless he is already married			1
the rhyming message said : ' i hope your kilt will fit you well , & in it you will look a swell			1
' if married never mind			0
if single drop a line			0
' wish you bags of luck , & a speedy return back to @entity49			0
' economic historian dr @entity50 , of the @entity51 , found the hand - written message when she was removing the packing stitches from the kilt , which has been passed down her family over decades			1
the @entity21 kilt , manufactured by @entity58 of @entity59 in @entity60 , would have been made for use by a soldier sent to fight in the war , but for reasons unknown , it was never unpacked or worn			1
dr @entity65 is now hoping to find the descendants of the seamstress to uncover the story behind the note			2
heirloom : dr @entity50 , an academic at the @entity51 , found the note in the kilt , where it had lain untouched for around a century she said : ' this garment has been in our family for a number of decades , and until recently , we were completely unaware there was such an intriguing secret hidden in its folds			1
it was a real surprise when the note fell out			0
' my father tried to trace any relatives of the note 's author a few years ago , but his efforts failed and i 'm hoping to pick up where he left off			2
' there are many unanswered questions			0
we do n't know how many of these poems this lady sent			0
' was this a one off , or were there many more lost to the battlefield , or even still existing undiscovered ? ' if there were more , did anyone ever answer her message and indeed did she ever meet and marry a soldier returning from the war ? ' it would be fantastic to trace who this lady was and learn more about her history , as well as the social history of the women who made and packed the kilts , which ultimately went to clothe the soldiers fighting in the trenches			2
' clothing historian professor @entity111 from the @entity51 said : ' the condition of the kilt is very striking - you do not expect to see a piece that has such clear links to the @entity117 being in such good condition			0
' the construction , which is very simple , in combination with the efficient use of fabric and the way one size could be made to fit most men , made kilts of this type a very versatile piece of military uniform , which also retained its distinctive national identity			0
