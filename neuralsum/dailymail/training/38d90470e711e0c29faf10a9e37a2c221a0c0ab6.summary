a @entity2 victory in thursday 's crunch @entity4 by - election will spark ' instability and insecurity ' , @entity0 has warned			1
the prime minister issued the stark warning during a final visit to the @entity12 constituency today , which looks set to return former @entity14 @entity13 as @entity2 's second elected mp			1
mr @entity0 also refused to deny house prices in the town could tumble if mr @entity13 triumphs for @entity2 following ' desperate ' warnings from @entity14 backbench @entity20			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity14 candidate for @entity4 and @entity23 , @entity24 ( right ) , visit @entity25 near @entity4 , @entity12 today mr @entity0 spoke to @entity26 , @entity27 at @entity28 , during his fifth and final visit to the @entity4 and @entity23 constituency ahead of the forthcoming by - election later this week the @entity8 said : ' i 'm not a forecaster of house prices but i do know this : the choice at this by - election is between whether to vote for @entity24 - a strong , local candidate who backs our economic plan - or to vote @entity2 , where you 've got instability , insecurity and the danger of @entity46 being a step nearer @entity48			1
' his remarks came after @entity51 , the mp for @entity52 , said on the campaign trail yesterday : ' the danger is if you vote @entity2 , the value of your house will go down			2
' mr @entity13 is odds - on favourite to retain the @entity4 and @entity23 seat he won as a @entity14 in 2010 before defecting to the @entity62 party and stepping down to force thursday 's contest			1
the @entity64 have all but abandoned hope of victory despite mr @entity0 spearheading a massive push to avoid a repeat of the result in @entity70 , where defector @entity71 won for @entity2 by a large majority			1
mr @entity0 's visit to the town today is his fifth and final visit ahead of thursday 's contest			1
a @entity2 victory has raised the spectre of further @entity14 backbenchers transferring their allegiance to @entity80 's outfit but the prime minister declined to speculate on the implications for a second bruising reverse			1
@entity13 , the former @entity14 local mp now standing for @entity2 , was out canvasing for votes in @entity4 today @entity13 ( left ) is the favourite to win the @entity12 seat in thursday 's crunch by - election mr @entity0 said : ' between now and thursday what i 'm going to do is focus on this by - election			1
' i want the people in @entity4 and @entity23 to have the best possible choice : @entity24 , a strong local candidate , living here , working here , born here , raised here , the community absolutely at her heart			2
' that 's what i 'm going to be focusing on			2
then let 's see what the result is on thursday and take it from there			2
' asked if he was satisfied enough of an effort had been mounted to try to keep hold of the seat , he said : ' i think @entity24 has fought a very strong local campaign ... and she has been very strongly backed by the @entity14 - by cabinet ministers , ministers - and i think it 's absolutely right to do that			1
' i believe in leading from the front so i have been keen to come down here five times and to play my part in the campaign			0
it 's the right thing to do			0
' he said : ' the only poll that counts , as they say , is the one on polling day			0
it 's quite clear this is a two horse race			0
' the scale of mr @entity0 's task was underlined by the fact that the boss of the firm he was visiting admitted he had been wavering over whether to end his long history of voting for the conservatives on thursday			2
@entity2 supporter @entity134 ( left ) with his dog @entity136 , were out canvassing for support ahead of the election while he was not prepared to back @entity2 yet as their policies were ' not strong enough for me ' - @entity139 suggested it remained a possibility ' later on down the line ' once they had been more tested			0
' they 've certainly got the public imagination , ' the director of @entity148 told reporters - citing the issues of immigration and @entity154 - after showing the pm the heating and ventilation control units being made at the small factory in @entity158			0
he was dismissive of mr @entity80 's beer - swilling image , saying he needed to ' turn that down a bit ' if he wanted to broaden his appeal , adding : ' do you want someone like that running the country ? ' but he was also critical of all politicians , saying he did n't ' really support any of them ' and suggesting ' the whole lot need their heads banging together '			0
asked if he was considering switching his vote to @entity173 , he said : ' to be honest with you i would consider voting for whoever i thought was best for the country			0
' i should imagine it will be conservative if i 'm honest			0
' he said he had been encouraged by what he heard from mr @entity0 about action to force banks to lend , complaining that the refusal of the bank he had used for more than 30 years to provide funds when the firm was hit by the recession and had to shed several posts had seriously delayed its resurgence .			0
