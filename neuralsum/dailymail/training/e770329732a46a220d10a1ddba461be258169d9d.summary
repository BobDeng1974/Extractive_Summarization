@entity1 's welfare budget is to be capped at around £ 120billion - a - year to stop the benefits bill ballooning out of control			2
chancellor @entity4 wants to limit the total amount the state spends on handouts , with ministers forced to face a @entity10 vote if costs spiral			2
only pensions and @entity13 will be excluded , meaning a raft of payments including pensioner benefits , income support , maternity pay and most housing benefit could be in the firing line			1
he wants to use the new cap on total welfare spending to keep a tighter grip on the nation ’s finances , so that future chancellors do not allow benefits to rise when times are good			1
the @entity37 will set a forecast for each of the next five years			2
if the government is going to breach the cap , the @entity43 will be summoned to the @entity10 to explain what action , if any , they plan to take before facing a vote			0
mr @entity4 told @entity46 : ' @entity1 should always be proud of having a welfare system that helps those most in need			0
' but never again should we allow its costs to spiral out of control and its incentives to become so distorted that it pays not to work			0
' in future , any government that wants to spend more on benefits will : have to be honest with the public about the costs , need the approval of @entity62 , and will be held to account by this permanent cap on welfare			1
' the move is designed to challenge the @entity26 to match the @entity66 ’ tough approach to benefits			0
but it has proved controversial because it will include most benefits within the control of ministers , except @entity13 or the state pension			1
mr @entity4 insists he will not cut pensions ' for those who ’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on , say , housing benefit for young people had got out of control '			1
@entity13 will not be included , because it rises and falls in line with the state of the economy			0
mr @entity4 argues that the government has a ' responsibility to taxpayers ' to control spending on welfare and in turn @entity62 has ' a responsibility to the country to hold the government to account for it '			1
housing benefit , @entity93 and @entity94 make up the biggest expenditure on beneifts last month work and pensions secretary @entity97 said pensioner benefits including free tv licences , bus passes and help with heating bills would be included in the cap			1
are you better off after today 's budget ? are you better off after today 's budget ? now share your opinion he warned existing protections for a raft of benefits would have to ‘ disappear ’ once the government sets a limit on the £ 100billion welfare bill			0
in december mr @entity113 admitted that maternity and paternity pay for new parents would be included in a new cap on welfare spending			1
the cost of the benefits , which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children , is set to exceed £ 2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up			0
housing benefit is the single biggest cost for the taxpayer , totalling £ 23.8billion in 2013 - 14			2
@entity93 costs £ 13.8billion , @entity94 £ 9.6billion and @entity129 £ 5.6billion			0
the bill for @entity131 is £ 3.3billion , carer 's allowance £ 2.1billion and maternity pay £ 2.4billion			2
winter fuel payments cost £ 2.2billion , and tv licences for the over- 75s £ 604million .			0

at the start of a @entity62 the @entity37 will forecast welfare spending
if the cap is breached , ministers will have to explain it to the *commons*
*mps* will then hold a vote on whether the costs should be allowed to rise
only the state pension and @entity13 will be excluded
housing benefit , income support and maternity pay could be cut
also raises the prospect of pensioner benefits being *threatened*
