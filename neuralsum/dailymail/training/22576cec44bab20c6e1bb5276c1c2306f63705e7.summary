by @entity0 published : 12:22 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 12:25 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 ’s second biggest supermarket put up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a @entity8 price war			1
@entity9 launched the promotion to grab customers from mainstream rivals and boasted its prices would be even cheaper than pound shops and @entity15			1
however , independent research has discovered that the prices of many of these products went up sharply in the ten weeks before the promotion was launched			1
the net effect of the yo - yo prices was to make savings look much bigger than they were			2
yo yo prices : @entity9 has been accused of putting up prices on more than 100 products before cutting them to 50p in a @entity8 price war the same tactic has been deployed by other major supermarkets in the past as a marketing strategy designed to attract customers trapped in a cost of living squeeze			1
the mainstream chains – @entity35 , @entity9 , @entity36 ’s and @entity37 – are under huge pressure because thousands of shoppers are deserting to cheaper budget chains , such as @entity15 and @entity41			1
the revelations about the @entity9 price cuts will come as no surprise to families who have lost trust in supermarkets to deliver the price cuts they claim			2
at the same time , official industry figures show that food prices continue to rise faster than rises in wages , which makes clear that any temporary reductions on some items are more than wiped out by increases on others			0
the research was carried out by retail experts at @entity59 and published in the industry magazine @entity60			1
the figures show that @entity9 reduced the price of 246 lines to 50p on january 1 on the back of a promised to ‘ offer more value than ever ’			1
claims : researchers say @entity69 biscuits went up in october from 50p to £ 1.08 before going back down to 50p in january in fact the price of 120 of these products was raised in the previous 10 weeks			1
at the same time , the average price of 155 items that were directly comparable with others sold by @entity35 and @entity36 ’s rose by an average of 46per cent – 63p to 92p – over the same period			0
denial : @entity9 said they would never deliberately mislead their customers but experts said today it was a common tactic the investigation also found that 57 of the items that were reduced to 50p have now returned to their full price			2
on october 30 , the @entity87 went up from 50p to £ 1.19 , while @entity88 increased from 50p to £ 1			2
both then were reduced to 50p on january 1			2
another big riser in october was oreo vanilla biscuits , which climbed from 50p to £ 1.08 before going back down to 50p			2
@entity91 , insight director at retail analysts @entity93 , suggested supermarkets who are not open and straightforward with customers risk losing out			0
‘ this type of strategy -- of raising prices to make a promotion look more lucrative -- is commonplace among all the supermarkets , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is not necessarily the right thing to do and @entity9 is not being as transparent as it could with its shoppers			0
’ when @entity9 launched the price cut promotion in january , its chief merchandising officer for food , @entity107 , said : ‘ with hundreds of products at 50p , we ’ re even making the pound shop and @entity15 look expensive			1
‘ it goes without saying that @entity111 can be a struggle financially … and it ’s more clear than ever that @entity3 shoppers ’ priorities are well and truly focused on price			0
‘ that ’s why , this january , we are offering more value than ever before across our stores on the products that people actually week in , week out			1
with hundreds of products at 50p , we ’re even making the poundshop and @entity15 look expensive			1
’ @entity9 , which is owned by @entity122 of the @entity123 , claims it is holding down prices by £ 50million in the first three months of 2014 as part of a bigger £ 200m reduction during the year			0
the store denied trying to pull the wool over customers ’ eyes			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we would never deliberately mislead our customers , all we aim to do is save them money every day			0
‘ at @entity9 , we take pricing incredibly seriously , so much so that last year we formed a @entity137 group that monitors every aspect of our pricing			0
last year we invested over £ 130million directly into lowering prices and holding down the cost of living for our customers			0
‘ we ’re equally proud that we have already committed to directly investing over £ 50million into lowering the costs of our products across our stores this quarter and we ’ve now got more 50p lines than any other supermarket			1
’ in november , the retailer announced that it will be investing £ 1 billion in lowering prices and £ 250 million in quality , style and design over the next five years .			0
