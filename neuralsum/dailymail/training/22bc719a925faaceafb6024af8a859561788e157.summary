it was left to head judge @entity38 to take charge , as he rushed onto the stage to pick the sobbing teen off the floor			1
former @entity53 also arrived onstage still weeping , and stood awkwardly behind @entity1			2

mother knows best : while her mother tried to comfort her @entity1 screamed at her clearly distraught with the news she was going home oh dear : as @entity1 bawled her mother came out on stage to try and comfort her while the judges and @entity14 looked concerned @entity33 relaxed competition rules to allow younger performers to bid for stardom , while in the @entity73 the age limit is still fixed at 16			2

' comforting words : as @entity38 tells the teen she has a career ahead of her @entity10 is seen crying behind them as the cameras cut to the montage of her time on the show @entity10 also appeared inconsolable and held her hands up to her face			1
when @entity14 asked her if she had anything to say she simply turned away , adding to the emotional tension present on stage			0
@entity10 did n't want to pick between @entity1 and @entity12 and turned to the other judges to seek their advice as she said : ' i ca n’t make this decision i ’ve been up there and i know how that feels			1
' but with @entity38 and @entity88 both opting to save their own acts and @entity124 choosing to save @entity1 , @entity10 was left with the final decision			1
thanks for voting : @entity1 managed to compose herself to say thank you to her fans and told them it would n't be the last they see of her call for peace : @entity1 tweeted after the show for people not to be angry with @entity10 foreboding : @entity38 tweeted that he had a ' weird feeling ' shortly before the show after a drawn out pause she reluctantly chose to send @entity60 home , thus putting the pair to deadlock , but it was revealed the teen had failed to attract as many votes as @entity12 , and the exuberant little girl was clearly shattered by the news			1
when she managed to compose herself @entity1 fought back her emotions to say a few words			2
i ca n't : as @entity14 asked @entity10 if she had anything to say she could n't control her own tears , holding her head down before turning away speaking through her tears she gushed : ' i just love you so much , everybody , for voting for me even though you did n't and thank you for giving me this because without you i am nothing			2
' i hope this is not my ending , you know what i know it 's not			0

i believe she went out on the highest she could have gone out on			0
like i said , from the very first time i met you , we 're going to be hearing a lot more about @entity1 , i give you my word on that			2
' @entity10 also appeared to be devastated by the public decision and was seen with tears streaming down her face and @entity181 got up to wrap her arms around her in an attempt to offer comfort			0
what have i done ? @entity10 looked distraught as she learned that @entity1 would be going after she sent the decision to the public vote singing for their lives : @entity1 took on @entity191 's @entity190 , while @entity12 performed @entity193 track i 'm going down while @entity195 and @entity196 were told they were through to the semi final at the start of the show , @entity38 was put under pressure when @entity201 had to wait with @entity1 and @entity12 to learn her fate			1
she was put through and it was down to the energetic teenager and religious man @entity12 to perform their save me songs			0
i love you : @entity196 showed his love to the audience as he was told he was through while @entity195 was seen picking up his mentor @entity10 tense : backstage @entity201 joined @entity1 and @entity12 to find out who was in the sing off as @entity1 learned she was in the bottom two signs of the strain were obvious @entity1 took on @entity191 's @entity190 , while @entity12 performed @entity193 track i 'm going down			1
