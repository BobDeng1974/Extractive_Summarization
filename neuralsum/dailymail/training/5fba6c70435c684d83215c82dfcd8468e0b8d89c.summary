the world ’s longest - running experiment has just had a ' breakthrough ' , after its ninth droplet of tar slowly gave in to gravity			1
the droplet was captured by the @entity8 ’s live webcam , although the blob has n’t yet entirely separated from its parent chunk of tar			1
the experiment is listed in the @entity13 as the world 's longest - running laboratory experiment and was designed to show how seemingly solid objects can in fact be liquid			1
rivetting : at room temperature pitch ( pictured inside a glass funnel container ) feels solid and can be shattered with a blow from a hammer , yet it is in fact fluid			2
the ninth drip can be tentatively hanging before it dropped in this image the first professor of physics at the university , professor @entity28 , began the experiment in 1927 to explain that everyday materials can exhibit strange properties			2

yet it is in fact fluid			0
this can be seen by the incredibly slow drips that have formed in the pitch experiment			0
scientists estimate that pitch is about 100 billion times more viscous than water			0
the experiment demonstrates the fluidity and high viscosity of pitch , a derivative of tar once used for waterproofing boats			0
at room temperature , pitch feels solid and can be shattered with a blow from a hammer , yet it is in fact fluid			2
professor @entity28 heated a sample of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel with a sealed stem			0
it was then left for the three years , so that the pitch could settle , and finally , in 1930 , the sealed stem was cut			0
since then , the pitch has slowly dripped out of the funnel - so slowly that now , 84 years later , the ninth drop is only just fully formed			1
the eighth drip that fell in 2000 and the ninth drop both took around 13 years to fall			1
touchdown ! here the drip of pitch can be seen making contact with the eight drop at the bottom of a beaker			0
the eighth drip that fell in 2000 and the ninth drop both took around 13 years to fall the experiment was set up as a demonstration and is not kept under special laboratory conditions - it is currently stored in a display cabinet in the foyer of mathematics and physics department			1
because of this , the rate of pitch flow changes with seasonal variations in temperature			0
nonetheless , scientists have estimated that the viscosity of pitch is around 20 billion times more viscous than water			0
1927 hot pitch poured october 1930 stem cut december 1938 1st drop fell february 1947 2nd drop fell april 1954 3rd drop fell may 1962 4th drop fell august 1970 5th drop fell april 1979 6th drop fell july 1988 7th drop fell november 2000 8th drop fell 17 april 2014 9th drop touched 8th drop sadly this latest glimpse of physics in action comes too late for a former caretaker , who watched over the experiment for more than 50 years and died last year			2
professor @entity104 , missed observing the drops fall on three occasions – by a day in 1977 , by just five minutes in 1988 , and in 2000 when a webcam that was recording it missed the crucial moment when the drop fell during a 20 - minute power outage			0
the next step is to monitor how long it takes the ninth drop to separate from the pitch above it			1
nearly 25,000 viewers from 158 countries have registered to keep an eye on the ninth drop through the live web stream at @entity119 .			1

@entity121 was captured by the @entity8 's live webcam , although it has n’t yet entirely separated from its parent blob
experiment designed to show how ' solid ' objects can in fact be liquid
the next step is to monitor how long it takes the ninth drop to separate from the pitch above it
