@entity1 manager @entity0 admits the @entity2 means he may have to wait until the last minute to complete his transfer business			2
the @entity4 can at least be more definitive with his summer spending after @entity8 's weekend @entity7 final defeat guaranteed the @entity1 ' direct progress into the group stage of the @entity11			1
however , he will also give some of the club 's emerging young talent the chance to stake a claim for promotion to the first - team squad during pre-season			2
tension : @entity1 boss @entity0 admits the @entity2 could hinder his transfer aspirations rewarding youth : @entity0 will also give @entity1 's young guns a chance to shine like @entity26 's @entity25 and stand - by defender @entity27 the @entity1 ' under - 18s won their league with victory over @entity31 on saturday and that could pave the way for some players to follow the path trodden by the likes of @entity25 , who earned a @entity2 call - up on the back of the pivotal role he was given by @entity0 this year			1
' recruitment is going to be important , ' @entity0 told @entity42			0
' the right characters need to come to the club and we need to be large enough in terms of numbers to face every competition with a real desire to hit good performances			0
' i do feel we have to be really clear in what we need , who we bring in , and it is going to take until the last day of the window to finalise the squad			0
' it is a @entity2 year and things will get delayed and certain situations will be worth us waiting until the last second to see if they happen or not and that is something we are well in control of			0
uncertain : the future of @entity67 loan striker @entity66 ( left with @entity25 ) is yet to be confirmed ' we have our targets and we have highlighted the positions we need to bring players in			1
' but i also have a few young players who will be given an opportunity in pre-season and depending on how they do they will fill some of those positions in the fist - team squad			2
' i think our young players next season will have a massive say in how good we are going to be			0
' we know what we are going to get from the experienced players but every time you bring a player into the club there is always a margin of error in terms of how they will adapt			0
' borrowed and blue : @entity90 was a mighty midfield presence for the @entity1 on loan from @entity31 @entity0 , who will also use the loan market extensively again , is looking to add two strikers , a right winger , defensive midfielder and a defender to his squad			1
the future of @entity66 , who scored 16 goals in a season - long loan at @entity102 , is likely to be one which drags on well into august as parent club @entity67 want to see how he performs at the @entity2 before making a decision on the striker			1
@entity0 would be happy to take back the @entity107 , @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity111 's @entity110 - who played just one game because of injury after a january loan move - on loan again for another campaign if possible .			1

@entity0 will be finalising his squad up to the end of the transfer window
he *'ll* also give emerging talent a chance to be the next @entity25
@entity1 ' under - 18 side won their title with a final win over @entity31
@entity1 go into the @entity11 group stage after @entity8 's @entity7 defeat
@entity67 loanee @entity66 's future is *unclear* after a 16 - goal season
