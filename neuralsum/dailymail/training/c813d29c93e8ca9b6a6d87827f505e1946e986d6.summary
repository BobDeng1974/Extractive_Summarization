the young prisoner stood motionless in the office of the factory manager			0
next to him stood the chief foreman and the floor foreman , who had reported him for his grave offence			0
‘ what were you thinking ! ? ’ the manager screamed			1
‘ do you want to die ? ’ of course , he did not want to die — he was just 22 years old — but he knew , after many years in the brutal hell of @entity14 ’s @entity13 , that life was very cheap			1
‘ even if you die , the sewing machine ca n’t be brought back , ’ the manager shouted			1
‘ your hand is the problem ! ’ the chief foreman took hold of his right hand and , with a large kitchen knife , cut off the prisoner ’s middle finger , just above the first knuckle			1
incredibly , the prisoner felt that he ’d got off lightly			0
‘ i thought my whole hand was going to be cut off at the wrist , ’ he said , ‘ so i felt thankful and grateful			1
’ @entity48 ’s story of how he lost his finger is just one of the many horrors being recounted this week at a @entity54 commission of inquiry in @entity56 , @entity57			1
the commission are interviewing some 30 defectors who are fortunate enough to have slipped from the grasp of one of the vilest regimes the world has ever seen			1
death : in tapes taken in 2005 that @entity57 intelligence officers insist are fake , prisoners including children are kept in concentration camps that bear similarities to @entity48 's @entity13 ( file photo ) mr @entity72 , who testified on monday , is one of the more well - known defectors			1
he has recently published an account of his experiences in a book , @entity77			0
at times , the stories told by mr @entity72 and his fellow defectors are almost too unbearable to hear — but it is the intention of the commission to publicise such acts of terror committed by the regime			1
it is hoped news of them will trickle across the border into @entity14 , alerting its benighted people to what has been done in their name since the despotic @entity93 family took control in 1948			0
the 30 witnesses are just a handful of the hundreds of thousands of political prisoners incarcerated in a network of @entity14 ‘ kwan - li - so ’ — best translated as ‘ political penal - labour colonies ’			1
in these colonies , three generations of families are held for life , often on the basis that a single family member was once deemed guilty of an offence against the regime			1
the supposed ‘ crime ’ which saw mr @entity72 born at @entity13 in 1982 was that his two uncles had tried to flee the country in the mid-sixties			1
mr @entity72 ’s parents were both prisoners , and their marriage had been arranged in the camp			1
if their baby had been born out of what passes for ‘ wedlock ’ , then he would not have been allowed to live and they would have been executed for having ‘ sexual contact without prior approval ’			1
evil : @entity14 leader @entity121 , son of former leader @entity122 , presides over one of the most repressive regimes in history another defector , @entity126 - a , told the commission how one mother was forced to kill her own baby by holding it down in a bowl of water			1
‘ the mother begged the guard to spare her , but he kept beating her , ’ ms @entity126 said			1
‘ so the mother , her hands shaking , put the baby face down in the water			1
the crying stopped and a bubble rose up as it died			0
a grandmother who had delivered the baby quietly took it out			0
’ mr @entity72 testified that his first memory as a toddler was watching a public execution , and that he had seen two or three per year since			0
many of those executed are those caught trying to escape			1
one former prisoner , @entity150 , in his book @entity151 , has recalled a typical execution at @entity154 in which the condemned man had his mouth stuffed full of stones to stop him shouting out any statements against the regime that might be heard by the onlookers			0
the man was then bound with three pieces of rope : one around his eyes , one around his chest and one at the waist			0
the leader of the firing squad then shouted : ‘ aim at the traitor of the @entity170 … fire ! ’ three volleys were aimed at the man			1
the first hit him in the head , killing him instantly			0
the second hit him in the chest , causing him to slump , and the third , aimed at the waist , caused the man to fall into a pit			0
as mr @entity150 wryly points out : ‘ this simplified the burial			2
’ spy state : the @entity54 commission of inquiry will look into government policing activities in @entity14 prisoners are sometimes made to throw rocks at the corpse until its skin comes off			1
mr @entity150 also remembers how a bulldozer preparing some ground to be made into a field unearthed masses of body parts			0
‘ scraps of human flesh re-emerged from the final resting place , ’ he recalls			2
‘ arms and legs and feet , some still stockinged , rolled in waves before the bulldozer			2
one of my friends vomited			0
’ mr @entity150 was then made to throw the body parts into a ditch			0
‘ that scene frightens me even more today than it did back then , ’ he says			2
in some ways , those who die are the lucky ones and many prisoners do indeed choose suicide as the ultimate means of escape			1
just as in the @entity212 concentration camps decades before , prisoners are worked incredibly hard and subsist on pathetically meagre rations			2
as a result , the starving prisoners — many of them children , — eat what they can , including rats , frogs , snakes , and insects			1
mr @entity72 recalled how rats were especially valued , as their meat can help stave off a potentially fatal disease called pellagra , caused by a lack of protein and niacin			2
isolation : a satellite image shows a camp in @entity231 , @entity14 , where prisoners are thought to be held by the tyrannical government mr @entity72 would peel away the skin of a rat , scrape out its innards , chew the flesh and bones , then finish off with the rodents ’ small feet			2
mr @entity150 prized salamanders , but they have to be eaten live			0
‘ the way to eat a salamander is to grab it by its tail and swallow it in one gulp , before it can discharge a foul - tasting liquid , ’ he says			1
in the camps , the children eat anything that moves , including earthworms			1
if a group of prisoners is sent to work in a field , not one animal is left alive			2
not surprisingly , the penalty for stealing food is severe			0
at @entity13 , one six - year - old girl was found by her teacher to have five kernels of corn in her pockets			1
the teacher forced the young girl to kneel in front of the class , whereupon he repeatedly beat her around the head with a wooden stick			2
the class was forced to watch as her head swelled up with bruises , and blood leaked from her nose			2
eventually , she was taken away			0
she died later that evening			0
such treatment is by no means unusual , and torture is common			2
beatings on especially vulnerable parts of the body such as the face and hands are particularly favoured by the sadistic guards , who are encouraged to regard the prisoners as subhuman			2
victims are made to kneel motionless on concrete floors for hours , or crouch in special punishment boxes for 15 days at a time			0
prison state : a female @entity14 soldier stands guard at the entrance of a women 's jail on the banks of the @entity295 near @entity14 's @entity297 county more awfully still , those being tortured have often been denounced by members of their own families			2
one of the most gut - wrenching pieces of testimony made by mr @entity72 is his honest admission that it was he who betrayed his own mother and brother for plotting to escape from the camp			1
he was motivated by the fact that his mother had given rice to his brother and not to him , and partly because he knew that if they did escape , he too would be punished and in all likelihood shot			2
mr @entity72 was forced to watch their execution			0
at the time , he was so desensitised and full of hate that he felt they deserved their fate			0
when his mother was led out , he noticed her head was swollen from being beaten			0
as the noose went around her neck , she looked for her son but mr @entity72 did not meet her eye			0
her death was terrible , as she struggled at the end of the rope			0
his brother ’s death was equally horrific , as bullets splattered his brains everywhere			0
the methods of execution varied according to the whim of the camp ’s commandant			0
in 2004 , mr @entity72 managed to escape @entity13 and eventually the country disguised as a soldier			1
callous : @entity121 lives a fantasy life on the one hand , while allowing the torture and oppression of his people on the other although his story and those of others who have been testifying in @entity56 this week seem exceptionally brutal to our ears , they are commonplace in @entity14 camps			1
meanwhile , the country ’s leader , @entity121 , continues to live in a kind of @entity357 , divorced from the sufferings of his people			0
his latest pet project is to build a ski resort , which he claims will be for the use of all			0
just this week , though , the @entity364 government blocked a deal to sell @entity93 any ski lifts , as it is inconceivable that the resort will be used by the public			0
and worthy though the @entity54 commission is , it seems unlikely to stop the daily hell that is @entity14 .			1
