@entity1 's own father has made the sensational claim that his daughter was responsible for the death of @entity6 star @entity5 - and he can prove it			1
@entity7 , the ex-manager of the @entity8 , said that while he ca n't prove his daughter pulled the trigger on the shotgun that ended the grunge star 's life 20 - years ago , he ' can prove her involvement to a high degree of certainty			1
' @entity7 , who is estranged from his rock - star daughter said that he became convinced she killed her own husband after the @entity20 police released a note that @entity5 held in his wallet mocking his wedding vows that called his wife a ' b * * * h with zits '			1
@entity27 : @entity7 with his daughter @entity1 before their estrangement and before her marriage to @entity6 star @entity5 in 1992 @entity7 told @entity32 that he believes his 49 - year - old daughter was complicit in her husband 's death			1
updated : @entity7 has said that his book @entity37 : the assassination of @entity5 will be republished to include the proof of his daughters involvement he is planning to publish his proof in his upcoming republished book , @entity37 : the @entity39 of @entity5			1
the final clue that sealed his opinion was the handwritten note inside the music legends wallet			0
' do you @entity5 take @entity1 to be your lawful shredded wife , ' the note begins , ' even when she ’s a b * * ch with zits and siphoning all ( your ) money for doping and whoring			1
' @entity7 , who is also suspicious of the @entity20 police 's motives for only releasing new evidence 20 - years on , said that the note is key			1
' if you read the true meaning of this small note , and place it in conjunction with the rest of the evidence , anyone with even half a wit will see that something dire and awful took place , ' @entity7 alleges			0
indeed , his criticism of the @entity20 police is strident			0
' nobody , except me , asked the obvious question : ‘ why were n’t they developed 20 years ago ? ’ he added to @entity32			0
' they were n’t developed because the police had already decided it was a suicide and did n’t need any more evidence			0
' just prior to april 1994 : @entity5 of @entity6 ( right ) with wife @entity1 and daughter @entity81 @entity7 and @entity1 's fractious relationship mirrored that of his with her mother @entity84			1
the pair were hanging out together and tripping on @entity87 when their daughter , @entity1 was born in 1964			0
they soon split and @entity1 never became close with her father who specializes in medieval and @entity92 history			0
the brief contact they did have was when he would mail her packages of of @entity87 and @entity97 when she was living in @entity98 , @entity99 as a teenager			0
@entity7 is banned from seeing @entity5 and @entity1 's daughter @entity81 and has been concerned his daughter killed her own husband for years			1
' she 's a psychopath , she has a sociopathic personality like i do			0
i do n't know who killed him			0
i know who benefited from his death : my daughter , for one , ' said @entity7 to @entity112 's @entity111 in 2004			2
indeed , the note found on @entity5 has only add fuel to the fires of speculation regarding the circumstances of the grunge legend 's suicide and what role his troubled marriage and personal life played in the final days of his life			2
poetic play on words : this is the note that @entity5 carried in his wallet that sarcastically mocked his marriage to wife @entity1 the release of the note by @entity20 police last friday is the latest revelation to come out of the departments decision to launch an internal review of the investigation into the rock star 's death			1
anticipating huge media interest over the 20th anniversary of the star 's suicide by shotgun , the @entity20 police have decided to release dozens of never - before - seen picture from the crime scene			2
they also released for the first time , the investigative detective 's full report on the re-opening of the case - which came to the same conclusion of suicide , two decades on			2
however , the sarcastic note will provide fans and conspiracy theorists hours of debate as they attempt to decipher the meaning behind the words			0
was the note written in anger by a resentful @entity5 , desperate to escape his unhappy marriage ? or was it a play on words penned with the knowledge of @entity1 , that the musician carried around to remind him of their unconventional bond ? those who believe that @entity1 was involved in her husband 's death will point to the fact that the content and tone of this note wildly differs from his handwritten suicide note			1
new evidence : in march police in @entity20 announced that new photographs of the scene of @entity5 's suicide have been uncovered and developed scene : a police officer stands guard on the back porch of @entity5 's garage where @entity5 's body was found early 08 april 1994 in @entity20 , @entity190 , after an apparently self - inflicted gunshot wound the short marriage parody calls his wife a ' b * * * * ' who is ' siphoning money for doping and whoring			1
' this is in stark contrast to his believed suicide note which calls @entity1 a ' goddess ...			2
who sweats ambition and empathy			0
' adding to the scuzzy appeal of the note , it is written on paper from the @entity208 in @entity210 's gritty , crime - infested @entity209			0
the @entity212 's reputation is that of an achingly cool refuge for poets and artists , very much like @entity217 's infamous @entity216			0
and earlier this month on the eve of the 20th anniversary of @entity5 's suicide , the @entity218 released a cache of never - before - scene photos showing the room where the @entity6 frontman was found dead in april 1994			1
in march , the law enforcement agency announced that it had developed 35 photos taken by officers who responded to @entity5 's @entity20 - area home two decades ago			1
a set of photographs made public by police show the troubled singer 's suicide note the way he left it before taking his life april 8 , 1994			2
@entity238 reported that most of the photographs were shot on a 35mm film , which has become discolored over the years , giving the images a greenish hue			0
a few of the pictures were taken with a @entity245 , among them outside shots of @entity5 's garage .			2

@entity7 is the estranged father of @entity1 and used to be the manager the @entity8

' no doubt she was capable , ' @entity7 says . ' i ca n’t prove she pulled the trigger , but i can prove her involvement to a high degree of certainty . '
is to republish his book on the couple where he will *outline* his proof
finally convinced by the release by police of a note written by @entity5
the note was kept in @entity5 's *pocket* and calls love a ' b * * * h ' and a money - *grabber*
authorities ruled @entity5 's death a suicide and said he had taken a lethal dose of heroin prior to shooting himself
in march police said they had found four *undeveloped* rolls of film taken in @entity5 's home at the time of his death
detectives say the pictures found this year from @entity5 's home at the time he died contain nothing to *suggest* that his death was not a suicide
