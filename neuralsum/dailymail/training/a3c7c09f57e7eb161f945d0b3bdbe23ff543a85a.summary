by @entity0 @entity1 steps back in time whenever he goes through his front door - because his house is decorated just like a typical @entity6 home of the 1930s			1
ever since he grew up listening to @entity10 music , the 31 - year - old has been obsessed with the era , and has now spent £ 10,000 renovating his house in a classic style			1
among the home 's antique features are rare wallpaper which spent decades buried underground , original art deco fireplaces and an electric cooker which was among the first ever made			0
' i used to be told stories about the 1930s and we used to listen to the music , so i think that 's what 's inspired my interest			2
' he bought his home on a suburban street in @entity23 for £ 80,000 seven years ago , after it had stood empty for nearly a decade			1
the enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing @entity57 wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s , and cost mr @entity1 £ 100 a roll			1
unprepossessing : the three - bedroom home is outwardly indistinguishable from neighbouring houses playing along : a vintage piano bought by mr @entity1 , who loved 1930s music as a young child old - fashioned : the kitchen of the house looks like a real relic , without most modern conveniences back in time : the front room of the home , which cost mr @entity1 £ 80,000 when he bought it seven years ago he also bought up an early electric heater and three fireplaces - one bought for £ 400 , the other two simply salvaged from a skip			1
the home is heated in a traditional way too , as instead of central heating it relies on four coal fires			2
mr @entity83 said : ' there 's things like wall masts , art deco pictures , radiograms , those are things i 've been collecting since i was a child , i 've travelled all over the country for things i 've wanted			0
' i 've tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals , rather than being replicas			0
i even heat my water from the coal fire - which works out much cheaper than the modern way of heating water			2
cheery : mr @entity1 has thrown himself into the 1930s lifestyle , with a particularly sparse vintage bathroom poster : an advert for the @entity104 dating back to the glory days of mr @entity1 's home town motor : mr @entity1 , who runs a glazing business , has a vintage car to match his unique home eccentric : mr @entity1 's friends are keen to visit his home and find more vintage collector 's items for him ' some things have been really expensive , like the wallpaper i got on @entity32			1
i rely on sites like @entity32 quite a lot , second - hand shops , and my friends all know about it so they recommend things they 've seen			0
' one of my favourite items are my two suites - the first i bought from @entity32 , it 's by @entity130 carpet makers and has the original receipt for when it was bought			2
it cost £ 51 and when i got it , it came with a letter from the original owner 's son			0
' the letter says that average worker would have earned £ 6 per week back then so this would have been a really expensive piece of furniture back in the day			0
the other suite dates from 1928 and still has the original material			0
pricey : the wallpaper was salvaged from a 1930s @entity57 time capsule and cost £ 100 for each roll classic sounds : a wooden radio provides the soundtrack to mr @entity1 's lifestyle pottery : more of the unusual decorative objects mr @entity1 has managed to unearth memories : the 31 - year - old was inspired by hearing music and stories from the @entity10 era ' but my pride of joy is a @entity159 state of the art gramophone from 1937			1
it came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off , and a friend of a friend told me about it			0
' people are really interested in the house - my friends always ask if they can take pictures , they think it 's really different			0
' mr @entity1 now plans to paint the front of his house and re-plant the garden , in order to complete his vision of the perfect vintage home .			1
