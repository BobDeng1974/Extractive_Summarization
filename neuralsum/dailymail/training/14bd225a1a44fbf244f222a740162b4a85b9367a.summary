as the players retreated to the pavilion in dwindling light , it was clear that one test team had again increased its standing on day one at @entity6			0
what a job they did on @entity10 in the winter , that @entity12 and his colleagues should have made such hard work of these @entity16 tourists this summer			1
how did @entity12 nearly lose his job , and his marbles , to this lot ? how were @entity10 staring at a series defeat coming out of that second test at @entity22 ? @entity7 really did a number on @entity10 in the last @entity25 series			1
shaken : @entity12 and @entity10 have made hard work of the five - test series against @entity28 this summer stirred : @entity7 did such a number on @entity10 that their confidence was shaken going up against @entity28 click here to read the report from @entity33 day one at the oval it has taken them to here , almost , to recover their confidence and swagger			1
@entity28 ’s failed attempt to wage disciplinary war on @entity43 after @entity44 appears to have united @entity10 and , in doing so , healed some of the wounds of the winter			1
until that point , @entity7 had rendered @entity10 vulnerable and meek , their captain a shell of himself , even the younger members of the squad catching the fear that seemed to pervade the dressing - room at the first hint of crisis			1
@entity10 are still at risk from a tail - end with its dander up and in the last two years have given up 50 runs or more to the 10th - wicket partnership on eight occasions			1
the stand between @entity28 ’s captain @entity66 and the returning fast bowler @entity67 was worth 58 from 98 balls , the most successful @entity16 pairing of the day by a margin of 34			1
@entity10 seem unable to get the job finished under pressure — a remnant , perhaps , of a similar failing in the back - to - back @entity25 series			2
there is no doubt @entity7 hurt them and one wonders in what direction this series would have swung had their opponents been made of sterner stuff			2
as it is , @entity28 have lived down to the national stereotype , lousy tourists lacking the appetite for the challenge presented by a five - @entity90 series			1
increasingly , there is a disconnect between these countries			0
in @entity10 , the @entity90 is valued above all , the one - day game a lucrative sideshow			1
yet @entity16 cricketers are revered through the @entity98 competition , and the limited overs internationals are the only ones that now fill stadiums to capacity and beyond			1
bowler : the war against @entity43 after @entity44 appears to have united @entity10 together recovery : @entity43 's row with @entity28 went a long way to helping @entity10 turn the corner in the five - @entity90 series some think @entity28 will be more engaged this summer once the long - form fixtures are done			1
it makes the events of july , when @entity10 struggled so pitifully , ever more mysterious			0
@entity10 bowled extremely well on friday — as impressively as they have done in this campaign — yet without doubt @entity28 have lost their edge			2
‘ believe me , they are not this bad , ’ @entity118 wailed during his commentary , as wickets fell with alarming regularity			0
any team that loses its focus is precisely this bad			0
and @entity10 lost their way in @entity7 this winter			2
battered into submission , they became every bit as clueless as @entity28 were on friday , a malaise that has taken close to six months to shake off			0
they are coming out of the slump now , slowly			0
@entity130 opened his first spell with two wicket maidens , the first time an @entity10 bowler has made that happen since @entity135 against @entity136 in 2006			1
in the circumstances , then , the innings played by @entity66 in defiance of @entity10 ’s bowlers was a small wonder			2
it can be argued that he should be doing more as captain to inspire this squad , but his performance with the bat on friday was the definition of resistance			0
@entity130 's two wicket maidens was an @entity10 bowler 's first since @entity135 over @entity136 in 2006 @entity66 made 82 in a total score of 148 , the first time an @entity16 captain has been responsible for more than 50 per cent of his team ’s total			1
his ally , @entity67 , made just seven in a stand of 58			0
@entity67 rode his luck , as did @entity28 , dropped by @entity160 just five balls into his innings with the score on 95			0
had @entity28 failed to make three figures , however , there really could have been no complaints , but then the @entity6 crowd would have missed @entity66 ’s knock which included 15 fours , plus a six off the mercurial @entity169			2
the sight of his team - mates playing like men with scarce interest in the art of @entity90 batting only put @entity66 ’s achievement in sharper relief			1
he was the sole @entity16 batsman who played as if not ticking off the days to @entity180 ’s departure lounge			2
@entity181 , considering @entity28 have close to three weeks of one - day cricket remaining when the final test is over			1
proud : @entity66 looks like one of the few @entity16 batsmen that does n't have his eyes fixed on @entity180 yet @entity66 's 82 was the first time an @entity16 captain was responsible for more than 50 per cent of his team ’s total priorities ? @entity28 have close to three weeks of one - day cricket remaining when this final test is over this was the match in which @entity43 could realistically overtake sir @entity197 ’s record of 383 test wickets			1
he began the game on 376 , needing only eight in two innings to be crowned @entity10 ’s greatest bowler ( although , as @entity197 archly observed , that still leaves him 15 test centuries shy of true parity )			2
when @entity43 claimed the wicket of @entity208 after just four balls of play , it appeared the milestone could be on — certainly over two innings — but @entity28 , too willing to give up their wickets , soon dashed that hope			1
@entity43 ’s quest was quickly hampered by a fairer division of the spoils with @entity217 ( two ) , @entity169 ( three ) and @entity218 ( three ) all successful			0
@entity43 picked up the spare			0
as @entity10 ’s opening partnership steered a way past @entity28 ’s 10th - wicket benchmark of 58 , the narrative became increasingly familiar			1
given the meagre nature of @entity28 ’s score they needed to send @entity10 to bed two or three wickets down , but there is no @entity228 to inspire fear and an early breakthrough			2
@entity28 will claim they were cursed by misfortune when @entity12 looked to be out lbw to @entity232 with the score on 20			0
the appeal was rejected , much to @entity232 ’s fury , yet with no @entity236 to correct errors , @entity28 simply had to live with it			0
this is not the first time @entity12 has benefited from a little luck in this test series			0
by next summer , he could be back to his best			0
he will need to be			0
@entity7 are here again , and they are better than this bunch ; either of them , on the evidence of the passing summer			0
help : @entity43 shared the wicket spoils with @entity217 ( two ) , @entity169 ( three ) and @entity218 ( three ) record in sight : @entity43 needs six more in order to overtake sir @entity197 ’s record of 383 test wickets			0

@entity7 shook @entity10 up so much that @entity12 and @entity10 have made hard work of the five - @entity90 series against @entity28
the @entity90 is valued above all in @entity10 with one - day game a sideshow , yet @entity16 cricketers prefer the @entity98 competition
the war against @entity43 after @entity44 united @entity10 together
@entity130 's two wicket maidens were the first time an @entity10 bowler made that happen since @entity135 against @entity136 in 2006
@entity66 looks the only @entity16 that does n't fancy heading for @entity180
