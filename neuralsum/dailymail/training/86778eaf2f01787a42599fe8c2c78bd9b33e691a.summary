these fascinating pictures show how engineers in 1960s @entity2 secretly developed the @entity3 for the @entity4 â€“ a plane which still holds the record for being the fastest ever aircraft			1
the @entity3 is a long - range , strategic reconnaissance aircraft and these once classified photos reveal how @entity3 built three types of @entity10 in top secret conditions in @entity12 , @entity2			1
the aircraft were built by @entity14 aerospace company @entity3 under a ' black project ' - a highly classified military defence project unacknowledged by the government until its declassification			1
since july 28 1976 the @entity3 has held the world record for the fastest air - breathing manned aircraft with a record speed of 2,193.2mph			1
during reconnaissance missions , the @entity3 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats - if a surface - to - air missile launch was detected , the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and out fly the missile			2
the @entity3 was designed to have basic stealthy characteristics and served as a precursor to modern stealth aircraft			2
the @entity3 served with the @entity4 from 1964 to 1998 and a total of 32 aircraft were built ; 12 were lost in accidents , but none were ever lost to enemy action			1
around 93 % of the plane 's frame was made of titanium alloy which allowed the aircraft to fly fast and high an @entity67 trainer over the @entity68 in 1994 - the raised second cockpit is for the instructor since 1976 the @entity3 has held the world record for the fastest air - breathing manned aircraft flying at 80,000 ft meant that crews could not use standard masks , which would not provide enough oxygen above 43,000 ft , so specialist protective pressurised suits were made			1
the plane 's titanium skin was capable of surviving temperatures up to @entity80			0
the @entity3 was the world 's fastest and highest - flying operational manned aircraft throughout its career and is believed to be the most advanced airplane ever built in relation to the technology available at the time			1
these once classified pictures reveal how @entity3 built @entity10 versions of plane - this version is based on the @entity3 's precursor , the a- 12 @entity92 @entity3 was designed to have basic stealth characteristics and served as a precursor to modern stealth aircraft almost every aspect of its design required new approaches or breakthroughs in technology			1
to withstand high temperatures generated by friction in the upper atmosphere during sustained @entity34 flight , the @entity3 required an array of specially developed materials including high temperature fuel , sealants , lubricants , wiring and other components			0
around 93 % of the @entity3 's airframe consisted of titanium alloy that allowed the aircraft to operate in a regime where temperatures range from 450 degrees to 950 degrees			2
on july 24 1964 , @entity14 president @entity118 publicly announced the existence of the classified @entity3 program			2
the first flight was held on december 22 and operational aircraft deliveries began in 1966			0
an @entity3 refueling from a @entity125 - @entity124 during a flight in 1983			2
because they were powered by a uniquely formulated jet fuel , @entity127 were refueled exclusively by @entity130 tankers 1			0
@entity131 , @entity2 , to @entity132 , distance 2,299.7 miles , average speed 2,144.8 miles per hour ( 3,451.7 km / h ) , and an elapsed time of 64 minutes 20 seconds			0
@entity135 to @entity136 , distance 2,404 miles , average speed 2,124.5 miles per hour , and an elapsed time of 67 minutes 54 seconds			0
@entity139 , @entity140 , to @entity132 , distance 942 miles , average speed 2,176 miles per hour , and an elapsed time of 25 minutes 59 seconds			0
@entity142 , @entity140 , to @entity143 , @entity144 , distance 311.4 miles , average speed 2,189.9 miles per hour and an elapsed time of 8 minutes 32 seconds			0
these four speed records were accepted by the @entity148 ( @entity148 ) , the recognized body for aviation records in the @entity14			0
the @entity3 's first flight was held on december 22 and operational aircraft deliveries began in 1966 the @entity153 kept flying after their retirement from the @entity4 - one of them even stayed at @entity155			1
this photo shows an @entity3 at the @entity157 being retrofitted for a test			0
