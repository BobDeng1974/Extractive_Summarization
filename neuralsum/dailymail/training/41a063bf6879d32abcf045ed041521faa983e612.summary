hollywood star @entity0 said fellow celebrities and industry figures did not want to sign a petition supporting ' the interview ' film featuring the assassination of @entity7 as they were afraid of the consequences			1
@entity0 said he wanted to see the film released online to undermine the threats of the hacking gang , who are believed to be supported by @entity15 agents			1
and separately @entity16 said he wanted the @entity18 @entity17 to take action , and warned that @entity20 would be next to try to censor freedom of expression			1
@entity24 's computer systems were breached following a major hacking attack last month , which saw highly confidential material released as well as a string of embarrassing emails			1
the 53 - year - old described the tactic as ' brilliant ' , because the hackers humiliated @entity24 , which subsequently prevented anyone from standing up to defend them			2
he said : ' after the @entity50 joke , no one was going to get on the side of @entity52 , [ @entity53 , @entity54 co-chair ] and so suddenly , everyone ran for the hills			2
look , i ca n't make an excuse for that joke , it is what it is , a terrible mistake			1
having said that , it was used as a weapon of fear , not only for everyone to disassociate themselves from @entity52 but also to feel the fear themselves			2
they know what they themselves have written in their emails , and they 're afraid			1
' @entity0 said he approached a large number of important people to sign his petition but kept getting rebuffed			1
he said that people are afraid of potential retribution			1
' this is just where we are right now , how scared this industry has been made , ' he told the magazine			2
' quite honestly , this would happen in any industry			0
i do n't know what the answer is , but what happened here is part of a much larger deal			2
' and people are still talking about dumb emails			0
understand what is going on right now , because the world just changed on your watch , and you were n't even paying attention			2
' crucially , @entity0 said that , although @entity15 is being held up as the reason for the movie being pulled , the reality is different			1
' @entity24 did n't pull the movie because they were scared ; they pulled the movie because all the theaters said they were not going to run it , ' he told @entity108			1
' and they said they were not going to run it because they talked to their lawyers and those lawyers said if somebody dies in one of these , then you 're going to be responsible			0
' ' [ @entity115 ] is a silly comedy , but the truth is , what it now says about us is a whole lot			0
' we have a responsibility to stand up against this			0
' canned : @entity24 decided not to release @entity115 - in which an ailing talk show host ( @entity124 ) and his producer ( @entity125 ) land an interview with @entity127 - after all major theaters decided they would n't play it			1
the theaters were reportedly under pressure from malls who feared they would be terror targets @entity0 said that @entity24 should release the movie online to prove a point to @entity15 and anyone else who wishes to threaten free speech			1
' i just talked to @entity52 ( @entity140 , @entity54 co-chair ) an hour ago			0
she wants to put that movie out			0
what do i do ? my partner @entity143 and i had the conversation with her this morning			0
... stick it online , ' he said			0
' do whatever you can to get this movie out			0
not because everybody has to see the movie , but because i 'm not going to be told we ca n't see the movie			1
that 's the most important part			0
' we can not be told we ca n't see something by @entity7 , of all f * * * * * * people			1
' as for his motivation in standing up against the cyberhack and its aftershock , @entity0 said he is trying to protect his own artistic freedoms , as well as those of his peers			1
' frankly , i 'm at an age where i 'm not doing action films or romantic comedies , ' he told @entity108			2
' the movies we make are the ones with challenging content , and i do n't want to see it all just be superhero movies			2
' nothing wrong with them , but it 's nice for people to have other films out there			0
' workers removed a massive poster publicising @entity115 in @entity40 after its release was cancelled @entity180 has already pulled out of an unnamed thriller set in @entity15 - that was to star @entity182 - as a result of the current hacking scandal			1
a number of cinemas that planned to show a controversial 2004 movie , @entity188 : @entity189 , instead of @entity115 have now been forced to cancel the screenings			0
@entity188 , from @entity194 creators @entity191 and @entity192 , features @entity7 's father , @entity195 , as a singing marionette			1
at the end of the film , the leader 's head explodes			2
@entity202 's @entity201 said its long - planned @entity188 screening was canceled thursday by @entity204 , the studio that released the film			2
@entity204 have declined to comment			0
controversial : a handful of theaters across the @entity208 have cancelled screenings of @entity188 - the 2004 puppet comedy that parodies former @entity15 leader @entity195 - they planned to run in place of the interview the actor emailed @entity215 and said : ' this week , the distributors who would n't show @entity115 and @entity24 have sent @entity20 a commanding invitation			1
i believe @entity20 will accept the invitation			1
the damage we do to ourselves typically outweighs the harm caused by outside threats or actions			0
then by caving to the outside threat , we make our nightmares real			0
the decision to pull the interview is historic			2
it 's a case of putting short term interests ahead of the long term			0
if we do n't get the world on board to see that this is a game changer , if this hacking does n't frighten the @entity234 and the @entity235 , we 're in for a very different world , a very different country , community , and a very different culture			2
i 'm not sure the world has come to terms with all the implications of the hacking			0
i was in @entity247 and @entity248 right at the beginning of the @entity251 outbreak in april			0
it did seem to those of us there that the response was neither coming swiftly or with a true sense of urgency			0
this matter should be before the @entity17 today			1
' @entity261 - winning screenwriter @entity260 criticized the reaction to the @entity24 situation : ' today the @entity208 succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished , bedrock principle of free speech by a group of @entity15 terrorists who threatened to kill moviegoers in order to stop the release of a movie			1
' the @entity274 has described the cyber attack on @entity54 as a serious matter of national security			1
@entity274 spokesman @entity278 declined to confirm reports that @entity15 had attacked the movie giant , which pulled the film after hackers invoked september 11 , 2001 in threatening attacks on cinemas			1
but , in a sign @entity208 intelligence believes the attack came from an enemy of the @entity208 , he said : ' the president considers this to be a serious national security matter			1
' he continued : ' there has been destructive activity with malicious intent , and the administration believes that that activity merits an appropriate response from the @entity208			1
' @entity297 , senior defence analyst with the @entity299 corporation believes action against the hackers is necessary			0
he said : ' a weak response will only embolden @entity15 and lead to more serious attacks , even if it is not proven to be the culprit			0
' @entity15 has denied involvement in the brazen november 24 cyber attack , which experts say could have been carried out by disgruntled @entity24 workers or by supporters of a foreign power			1
former presidential nominee senator @entity311 criticised @entity24 for backing down , a few days after the so - called @entity313 hacker group threatened cinema - goers			0
he said : ' by effectively yielding to aggressive acts of cyber-terrorism by @entity15 , that decision sets a troubling precedent that will only empower and embolden bad actors to use cyber as an offensive weapon even more aggressively in the future			2
' former house speaker @entity323 said this week 's events should sound alarm bells			1
' with the @entity24 collapse @entity208 has lost its first cyberwar			1
this is a very very dangerous precedent			0
' criticized : @entity261 - winning screenwriter @entity260 ( right ) attacked the threats on moviegoers			0
he is pictured here with embattled @entity24 boss @entity53 , one of the worst - effected from the email hacks on november 24 of this year , @entity54 was notified that it was the victim of a cyber attack , the effects of which is the most chilling and devastating of any cyber attack in the history of our country			1
personal information including @entity343 numbers , email addresses , home addresses , phone numbers and the full texts of emails of tens of thousands of @entity24 employees was leaked online in an effort to scare and terrorize these workers			0
the hackers have made both demands and threats			0
they demand that @entity24 halt the release of its upcoming comedy @entity115 , a satirical film about @entity15 dictator @entity7			1
their threats vary from personal — you better behave wisely — to threatening physical harm — not only you but your family is in danger			0
@entity15 has not claimed credit for the attack but has praised the act , calling it a righteous deed and promising merciless measures if the film is released			1
meanwhile the hackers insist in their statement that what they 've done so far is only a small part of our further plan			0
this is not just an attack on @entity24			2
it involves every studio , every network , every business and every individual in this country			0
that is why we fully support @entity24 's decision not to submit to these hackers ' demands			2
we know that to give in to these criminals now will open the door for any group that would threaten freedom of expression , privacy and personal liberty			2
we hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are , we will not stand in fear			0
we will stand together .			0
