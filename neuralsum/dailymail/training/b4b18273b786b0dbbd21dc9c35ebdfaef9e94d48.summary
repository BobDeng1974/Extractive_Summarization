by @entity1 reporter published : 12:45 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 18 january 2013 the customer is always right , or so the old adage goes , but a tradesman from @entity5 disagrees with it so much he has launched a website so angry businesses can warn each other off working for ' nasty clients '			1
@entity11 , of @entity12 , the head of a landscaping company , founded @entity14 , a website he dubs the ' anti-yelp ' where angry contractors can vent against clients and alert each other to avoid being hired by them			1
members can search clients by name but business owners can remain anonymous			1
it enables contractors - as opposed to clients - to share their views and reveal cheap or annoying customers @entity11 , says he was inspired by the constant badmouthing of tradespeople by customers online and in the press			1
' the straw that broke the camel 's back was n't one particular story of mine , ' @entity11 tells @entity41 ' it was more the frustration of always seeing the other side of the story being told in the media			2
' ' you always see on the news ' another deadbeat contractor takes a deposit from a homeowner and does n't do any work ' or see reviews on @entity53 or @entity54 where the person is just ripping a business to shreds , but you never get the business 's side of the story and you never get to hear , ' hey , that customer that 's ripping on the business , maybe the customer 's really the jerk			1
'' the website provides a searchable database so companies can check out potential clients before agreeing to do work			2
@entity11 says he vets all the posts to make sure they stick to the facts , rather than allowing users to fire unsubstantiated abuse at clients who are n't there to defend themselves			1
outed : @entity11 hopes his website will attract aggrieved contractors who want to share bad experiences			1
it charges an annual subscription fee to those who want to use its database to search for bad customers an annoying customer is easy to spot by just meeting them according to the site			2
it says they are the kind of people who ' insist on “ your best price ' , ' alert you that they ’re getting at least 4 or 5 more estimates ' and ' ask you to do additional work for free while you ’re on the job '			2
they also ' constantly call with questions ' , ' take time off from their job to be home while you are working ' and ' stand over your shoulder the entire time '			0
money is by far the biggest cause of contention on the website			0
complaints on the site lament and reveal customers they call ' cheap - skates ' and ' cheap negotiators '			1
a landscaper , called @entity120 , says : ' i 've been stiffed for 20 grand from this guy			0
i work hard for this money and i 'm not happy '			2
a post written by @entity126 says : ' i did an estimate for a guy that i knew i should not have done ... i told him that if the lowest price was the most important thing to him that i would probably not be the cheapest bidder			0
he said price was not the most important thing to them			0
i reluctantly did eight separate estimates for only three jobs			0
when i called the guy to tell him my estimate , i asked if he had gotten his two other estimates yet			0
at that point he told me he was now getting 5 more estimates			0
what a waste of my time , because i am never the cheapest bidder			0
i am soooo sick of cheap skates ! ' customer not always right : @entity14 , left , outs clients that contractors think are rude or unfair so they can warn each other off accepting work from them			1
complaints include dubbing customers ' cheap - skates ' another anonymous post states : ' at the meeting the husband told me he found another guy that would do more work for a cheaper price and if i wanted the job , i needed to include some free work ... the extra work ended up taking two guys 8 hours , which equals a totally free day			1
we did the job and got paid , but i would just be aware that these people are the epitome of cheap negotiators			2
i do n’t get it			0
would these same people keep working at their job if one day their boss told them to work late every day for a week for no extra money ? ... these people drove me insane ! i would n’t work for them again and you should n’t either ! ' @entity11 says to promote fairness he encourages contractors to share their complaints with clients and if disputes are settled he 'll reflect it in reports			1
but ultimately the site , which anyone can subscribe to for $ 15.99 a year , is intended to punish those deemed unfair by workers			0
' the goal in my head for the website is , in same way a business owner now says to themselves , ' you know what ? maybe i should n't do shoddy work because i do n't want to end up on @entity53 and i do n't want a comment on the @entity198 , '' he told @entity41			1
' i want the consumer to say , ' you know what ? i better pay my plumber because i do n't want to end up on @entity203			0
i do n't want to be calling heating guys in january because my house has no heat , but everyone is saying they 're do n't want to work for me because i have three reports filed against me			0

@entity14 set up by @entity11 , of @entity12 , @entity5 , in *reaction* to customer sites like @entity53 and @entity212
contractors name clients but can *opt* to remain anonymous
posts complain of ' cheap - skates ' and people who watch contractors while they work
