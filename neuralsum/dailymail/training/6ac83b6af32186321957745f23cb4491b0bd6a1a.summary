by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 16 may 2013 we all make mistakes as teenagers that we would like to forget , but health and safely officer @entity5 has to live with his written all over his chest			2
@entity5 , now 31 , from @entity8 , had a bulldog tattooed on his chest when he was just 15			1
years later he lived to regret the decision but an attempt to have it removed made his situation even worse			2
from bad to worse : when @entity5 tried to have to tattoo removed , he ended up with unsightly blisters when the treatment went wrong when he was 26 , he was injected with a chemical solution that was supposed to push the tattoo ink out of his skin , ridding him of his youthful mistake			1
however , his body reacted badly to the treatment and he was instead left , not only with the tattoo still visible , but with unsightly bumps and scars on top of it			1
not only that , the treatment was incredibly painful and he needed to apply cream every day to sooth the damaged skin			2
mistake : @entity5 got the tattoo on his chest when he was 15 it also dented his self - esteem and made him too embarrassed to show his chest			1
' it 's all one big ball of embarrassment and a self - esteem killer , ' he admitted			1
@entity5 enlisted the help of the @entity38 tv show @entity37 to see if they could help him			0
skin expert dr @entity40 was horrified by the condition of @entity5 's skin			1
she said : ' to be left with such a mess after one treatment is quite shocking			0
' shocking : last @entity37 expert @entity46 was surprised by the state of @entity5 's skin no pain , no gain : she recommended @entity5 to have laser therapy treatment to remove the tattoo dealing with the problem with a skin graft was ruled out because this would lead to further scarring so dr @entity40 instead recommended @entity5 have a series of laser treatments			1
however , she warned him this was not a simple solution as laser therapy can be extremely painful creating a hot , stinging sensation on the skin			0
@entity5 would need thousands of laser shots into the area over a number of treatments to remove the tattoo			2
he would then need steroid injections to reduce the scarring			0
on the mend : @entity5 's tattoo is now fainter , right , after laser therapy but he will still need steroid injections to rid him of the blisters gaining in confidence : he 's delighted with his progress and ca n't wait till the tattoo is a distant memory returning to the @entity85 after the first phase of laser treatment , the colours of the tattoo were already fading and @entity5 's self - confidence returning			1
dr @entity40 said : ' he 's a great example of how getting on the path of recovery can lead to an internal transformation			0
' while @entity5 will still need further laser treatments and the steroid injections before his skin problem is completely resolved , he said he 's delighted with the progress so far			2
' the problem that was hovering over me i can really see it disappearing now , ' he said			0
