by @entity0 published : 03:48 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 08:30 est , 27 september 2013 fitness fail : chief constable @entity2 attempted the ' bleep test ' but came up short the police chief who helped catch the @entity5 has become the first chief constable to fail to meet the new police fitness targets			1
@entity2 , boss of the @entity8 force , is believed to be the highest ranking officer to flunk the bleep test - while trying to set an example to her staff			1
the force admitted she scored 4.2 on the test , compared to the 5.4 her rank and file officers will need to ensure their jobs are safe when the fitness checks come in officially in 12 months ' time			1
mrs @entity2 , 52 , joined @entity20 in 1984 and spent 28 years in uniform			1
she headed the investigation of the five prostitute murders in @entity24 in 2006 , for which serial killer @entity25 was jailed			2
mrs @entity2 was played by the tv and film actress @entity27 in @entity28 , the television drama based on the case			1
it is understood many @entity8 officers already regard the targets as a farce and their own commander failing to measure up has made them even more scornful			1
one source said : ‘ they just think the whole thing is a nonsense anyway			2
they think it 's a complete joke			2
’ expert prof @entity40 , co-author of the report @entity42 ? , said : ‘ this is what happens when senior management try to lead by example			1
‘ it can go horribly wrong			1
‘ people might think it was just paying lip service to the fitness test and i would be interested to know if she did any training for it			2
plodding is out of the question for officers if they want to pass the ' bleep test '			2
the setting for these tests is usually a large sports hall and the candidates must run continuously between two points set 15 metres apart			2
the pace for the runs is set by an audio track that plays continuous beeps , with officers required to reach the fixed points before the beep sounds			2
the interval between the beeps gradually lessens , so officers have to run faster and faster			2
the total amount of running time is usually around three and a half minutes			1
officers are allowed three warnings if they fall behind the pace			2
if they ca n't speed up sufficiently and hit the fixed points before the beep sounds the instructor will fail them			0
‘ the only way she could turn this into a success by getting fit and passing it			0
that would win over the officers and people 's perceptions			0
’ some forces favour an assault course which mimics what front line officers do during the working day , such as crawling and climbing			0
the @entity98 expert 's research suggests this obstacle course is unfair because it excludes too many female officers while letting too many podgy males through			1
but he believes the shuttle run used by forces such as @entity8 is fair to both sexes and ‘ a fail is a fail ’			1
he was not aware of any other @entity105 taking and failing the test			0
‘ it 's good to see one having a go but it seems to have backfired in this particular case and is not good pr , ’ he added			1
a spokesman for the @entity112 said : ‘ @entity113 feels that police officers should be fit to perform the role they do and we need to be realistic about the fact that a chief constable is not going to be knocking down doors and arresting people in the town centre on a saturday night			1
‘ we do have some concerns about the fairness of national fitness testing proposals , and will continue to engage with @entity125 and the @entity126 to ensure these concerns are addressed			0
’ time trial : the bleep test involves a series of 15 - metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed after rising through the ranks , mrs @entity2 joined @entity134 in 2006 as assistant chief constable after working in the @entity136			1
after helping snare the @entity5 , she joined @entity137 - initially as temporary chief constable - in 2011 when predecessor @entity139 was suspended and later sacked for misconduct following a probe into corruption allegations at the force			1
under the @entity146 plans , officers have to reach level 5.4 of the bleep or ' beep test ' , which involves completing a series of 15 - metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed			0
if they succeed , they will have been able to run for 3 minutes 34 seconds			0
those who fail will be given a fitness plan and 12 months to measure up - or face dismissal for ' unsatisfactory performance '			0
at one stage , failure was to be regarded as a disciplinary offence			0
now officers are given support and time to pass			1
a @entity137 spokeswoman said : ‘ the fitness tests started as a pilot this month and will be implemented in september 2014 for officers who undertake safety training for roles such as patrolling			0
‘ over the summer , a familiarisation exercise was run so that officers could see what the tests would entail , and the chief constable took part in the full day as she was keen to see what tests the officers would undergo , as well as supporting her staff			1
‘ as she does not undertake an active operational role , she is not required to take the fitness test			0
’ the @entity125 refused to comment mrs @entity2 's performance , saying it would not discuss a specific case			1
@entity182 @entity181 , national fitness working group lead said : ‘ annual fitness testing is being introduced to policing and involves a 15m shuttle run to be completed to an endurance level of 5:4 and is compliant with equality legislation			0
’ there is no obstacle course or upper strength testing as part of this annual fitness test			0
‘ we will be ensuring that the fitness test does not unlawfully discriminate against gender or other protected groups , and for the first 12 month the @entity126 will audit data on pass and failures to understand how specific groups are performing			0
’ the @entity126 , which is the guiding light of the new fitness regime , underlined there was no instant dismissal threat for officers who failed to measure up			0
the scheme was being piloted for 12 months and staff would be given support to @entity211 an officer repeatedly failed it would be an operational matter for the individual force whether disciplinary measures were required			0
but there was no reference in the official guidelines to dismissal , the @entity126 said .			0

@entity8 police chief constable @entity2 came up short on a time trial
it was described by one expert as a pr stunt that went ' horribly wrong '
