from the earliest imaginings of what ' the heavens ' were made up of to @entity13 's latest @entity12 mission on @entity14 , an unquenchable thirst to conquer , or at least understand , space has pervaded mankind 's time on @entity18			1
now , a new exhibition has brought together more than a hundred awe - inspiring images of space which straddle the line between science and art. the first glimpse of the @entity26 , photographed from the @entity28 3 spacecraft in 1959 this photograph was taken during one of five expeditions sent by the @entity31 at @entity32 to observe the transit of venus of december 9 , 1874 drawing of the minute structure of the solar surface by @entity36 , 1873 starting with @entity38 , the first person to look at the stars through a telescope , @entity37 charts the development of astronomical imaging			1
the exhibition , held at the @entity45 , in @entity32 , @entity46 , reveals the role astronomers have played in pushing forward the technology of cameras and telescopes , which means we are now able to see the weather on distant planets and look beyond the @entity54 into galaxies beyond			2
among the images on show is a photograph taken during one of five expeditions sent by the @entity31 at @entity32 to observe the transit of venus of december 9 , 1874			2
astronomers were sent to @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and islands in the @entity66			0
many used photographic plates to record their observations accurately			0
meanwhile , a drawing of the minute structure of the solar surface by @entity36 , in 1873 , at the @entity31 , @entity32 , also features			0
the images also chart the technological advances through the 20th and 21st centuries , showcasing the first glimpse of the far side of the moon and pictures taken by @entity80 in 1969 all the way up to the latest images from the @entity83			1
astronauts repairing the @entity83 : this picture , taken from the @entity86 space shuttle in 1993 , shows astronauts @entity89 ( on the robotic arm ) and @entity91 ( inside the shuttle ) @entity93 on the @entity94 : on 20 july 1969 @entity93 became the second man to set foot on the @entity94			2
this picture was taken by mission commander @entity80 close to the landing site earthrise : one of the most iconic views of planet earth , taken from the @entity103 spacecraft as it orbited the @entity94 in 1969 @entity106 - layered rock deposits with evidence of ancient water : from orbit , just a few hundred kilometres above the surface , spacecraft like @entity13 's @entity112 and @entity113 reveal evidence of water in the distant @entity14 past a picture of @entity117 using imaging radar from the @entity120 spacecraft in 1991 @entity121 , taken from the @entity123 orbiter spacecraft in 2005			1
this sponge - like object is one of the most bizarre of @entity127 's family of over sixty moons visitors to the exhibition , which opens on friday , june 7 , will be able to take a visual trip through the solar system featuring images of the moon , the @entity135 , the planets and deep space , before coming back to @entity18 to a selection of images that reflect our fascination with the night sky			1
with views of the dazzling aurora on the surface of @entity127 , the spectacular clouds of colourful dust in which new stars are forming thousands of light years away , and the dizzying sight of @entity18 as seen from the @entity153 , the exhibition celebrates the aesthetic beauty of space photography as well as the scientific discoveries that advances in technology have allowed			2
the photographs on display include the latest cutting edge images captured by @entity13 , the @entity162 space programme and some of the greatest telescopes in the world , as well as highlights from the last four years of the @entity31 ’s highly successful astronomy photographer of the @entity168 competition			1
the @entity169 , taken from the @entity83 in 2005 , is the debris from a ' supernova ' explosion the @entity173 , taken from the @entity83 in 2009			0
the death of a star very much like the @entity135 allows us to glimpse our own distant future @entity178 : the three bright stars on the left in this image are the stars of @entity182			0
although part of a familiar constellation , a view such as this can never be seen with the naked eye @entity188 : continuing improvements in telescope and photographic technology allow 21st - century amateur astronomers to image galaxies in detail that would have astounded @entity195 this image of @entity127 's rings , taken from the @entity123 orbiter spacecraft in 2005 , shows how image - processing techniques can be used to convey scientific information which could not otherwise be seen organisers have said the centrepiece of the exhibition is the ' @entity204 ' - a 13 metre by four metre curved wall onto which the latest images beamed back by @entity13 ’s @entity12 are projected			1
the effect aims to create the impression of looking through a giant window out onto the rocky @entity14 landscape			0
it is the first time a museum exhibition has used images from a current space mission in this way			1
other photographic highlights on display include the first astronomical image ever taken ; @entity195 ’s 1923 photograph which confirmed the existence of galaxies beyond our own ; the 1969 image of the first human to walk on the moon ; and the astronomical photograph which helped to prove the @entity228			1
@entity229 away from the lights , taken with a @entity231 modified @entity233 camera			0
like an alien landscape , pools of hazy light stretch into the distance of this photograph taken near @entity239 in @entity240 @entity241 , @entity242 , taken in @entity243 by @entity244 , winner of the ' @entity18 and @entity246 ' category , @entity247 , 2009 , using a @entity249 dslr camera with @entity251 17 - mm lens lost in @entity252 : two lost hikers stand in a bubble of torchlight beneath the immense dome of the night sky			0
