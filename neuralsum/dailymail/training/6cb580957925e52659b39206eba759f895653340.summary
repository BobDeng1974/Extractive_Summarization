neither @entity12 nor church officials would give details ahead of a 1 p.m. news conference			0
the case against the @entity18 and @entity19 and the @entity20 ( pictured ) is believed to be the first clergy sexual abuse case nationwide to use the public nuisance theory at trial a statement from @entity12 's firm said church officials in @entity27 and @entity28 had agreed to 17 child protection protocols			1
' this is a landmark case , ' @entity12 said			0
' it 's monumental in a lot of ways			0
' the case against the @entity18 and @entity19 and the @entity20 is believed to be the first clergy sexual abuse case nationwide to use the public nuisance theory at trial			1
that claim allowed victims ' attorneys to seek evidence of sexual abuse across the archdiocese , rather than focus on allegations against one individual			2
it forced the unprecedented disclosure of tens of thousands of church documents and the names of dozens of accused priests			2
the flood of information , which included the public release of court - ordered depositions of archbishop @entity54 and other church leaders , revealed how top officials handled allegations of misconduct by priests			1
the disclosures compounded an already difficult year for church leaders			2
last fall , a former archdiocese employee went public with allegations that church leaders had mishandled several cases in which priests were accused of abuse			1
@entity65 ( pictured ) said in a deposition earlier this year that he molested around 12 teens from the 1960s to the mid- 1980s police began investigating several allegations , and @entity54 himself was accused of sexual misconduct , which he denied and resulted in no criminal charges			1
@entity54 has apologized for any mistakes , but despite public calls for his resignation he told the @entity77 in july that he would n't step down , and that he does n't believe he mishandled the situation			0
lawyers for the church had asked that the case be dismissed , saying the public nuisance claim did n't stand up , but @entity83 allowed it to proceed			1
the case was filed in may 2013 under a law that opened up a three - year window for victims of past sexual abuse to file claims that were otherwise barred under the statute of limitations			1
similar windows for lawsuits in other states have resulted in payouts in the tens of millions of dollars or more			0
the plaintiff , identified in court documents as @entity98 1 , claims he was abused by @entity65 in 1976 and 1977 , when the victim was an altar boy in @entity100			0
the complaint also alleged the archdiocese and diocese were negligent in allowing @entity65 continued access to children , even though leaders knew he had behaved inappropriately with young boys			2
@entity65 said in a deposition earlier this year that he molested around 12 teens from the 1960s to the mid- 1980s			1
he was removed from active ministry in 1985 and defrocked in 2009			0
