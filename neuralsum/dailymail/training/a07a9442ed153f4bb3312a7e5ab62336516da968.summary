for 50 years , @entity0 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			2
in a man walks on to a pitch , @entity0 reveals how close he came to signing @entity8 and @entity9 during his time as @entity12 manager			1
despite all that has happened in his career since , one of the biggest regrets of my life in management is not taking @entity9 to @entity12 when we had the chance			1
‘ you ’ve got to take him , @entity0 , ’ @entity22 told me			1
just when i was on the verge of taking the plunge , the price went up			2
in the end he was sold for £ 22.8million to @entity34			0
we would n’t have paid that			0

@entity8 was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now			1
he almost came to me at @entity12 from @entity79			2
i thought it was an incredible decision by him , after he ’d been such a hero at @entity77			0
i met him at his house in @entity95 and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get			0
he had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away			0
@entity8 celebrates winning the 2005 @entity102 - one of seven major trophies he won with @entity77 @entity8 was at @entity79 ( right ) when @entity0 tried to sign him but he eventually went to @entity80 the midfielder ( centre ) captained @entity12 ' bitter rivals @entity77 but @entity0 tried to lure him to the @entity107 @entity0 claims the @entity71 was keen on signing for @entity12 but the deal did not materialise in the end the then @entity12 manager @entity0 ( centre ) , pictured during training , wanted @entity8 to join the club @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 make @entity0 's modern era @entity117 @entity118 would have solved @entity120 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 make @entity0 's early era @entity117 @entity126 heralded a change in @entity120 football ... he introduced @entity129 and scouting reports @entity131 has the class of @entity133 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity8 and @entity122 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity0 fears that the @entity120 manager is in danger of becoming extinct pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity117 killed all that ! @entity146 's @entity148 interviews @entity0 about his new book the cover of @entity0 's new book i remember talking to @entity153 , our chairman , about him			1
he said the crowd would be hostile			0
i knew that — but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before , i thought it said something about the man			2
in the end , his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in @entity166			1
by the time he did become available — the following january — our needs had changed and @entity80 snapped him up			1
@entity8 is the player @entity77 have never really replaced , but i still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at @entity80			1
should n’t he be at @entity77 ? it is ironic that so many associate @entity126 with the beautiful game , yet his @entity77 teams , with @entity8 — the ultimate box - to - box midfielder — did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern @entity117			2
teams got bigger to compete with @entity77 because they were so strong			0
they were up there with any of the great post-war teams — the @entity182 , @entity12 ’s double - winners , @entity184 ’s @entity183 , the great @entity34 teams , @entity186 under sir @entity187 — they deserve to be mentioned with any of them			2
