house speaker @entity13 has said time and time again that the legal action the @entity5 intends to take against @entity7 is not a precursor to impeachment , but @entity3 have continued to link the two together , causing headaches for @entity4 leaders			1
and if the @entity8 's banner fundraising is any indication , the strategy is working			2
still , @entity3 have a huge hurdle to overcome ahead november 's elections if they are to win the 17 seats needed to take control of the @entity5			1
@entity4 ' ' accusations of presidential overreach have become a @entity4 overreach and that is motivating swing voters and persuadable voters , ' @entity38 told @entity45 today , arguing that @entity4 ' stepped into a mess on this			0
' @entity38 said that as a result of @entity4 ' election year scheme to take on the president , @entity3 are more fired up than ever			1
' the phone calls , the emails , people signing up , wanting volunteer on campaigns , has surged literally over the past several weeks , ' he said			0

' the @entity65 reports the @entity8 raised $ 2.1 million last weekend alone			1

the @entity8 also has more money in the bank - $ 50.9 million - than the @entity70 - $ 42.5 million			2
the @entity5 's lawsuit against @entity7 was meant to turn out volunteers and voters of its own			2
but so far , the strategy has backfired , giving @entity3 the upper hand as they return to their home districts this weekend for @entity81 ' month long recess			0
@entity38 told @entity45 the @entity5 's lawsuit would be a major part of @entity3 ' campaign strategies throughout the next month and the fall			2
' you bet we 're going to run on a @entity81 that is just obsessed with lawsuits , suing the president , talking about impeaching him , instead of solutions for the middle class , talking about jobs and infrastructure , ' @entity38 noted			0
' you bet that we 're going to ask people to support us based on that contrast			0
' smoking gun : the @entity8 begged donors for money on monday by floating the idea that @entity4 could impeach the president on monday the @entity8 emailed its largest donor list with a request for money based specifically on impeachment fears			1
the president , vice president and first lady , the solicitation read , ' need your help , because it ’s a critical moment			0
@entity5 @entity4 will vote this week to sue the president			1
and the @entity5 believes it could lead to @entity7 ’s impeachment			2
' ' it ’s time to have the president ’s back			0
with the most critical deadline we ’ve faced in just days , we ’re still 75,000 donations short of our goal			0
' @entity13 lambasted the impeachment claims on tuesday as ' a scam started by @entity3 at the @entity5			1
' ' this whole talk about impeachment is coming from the president 's own staff , and coming from @entity3 on @entity127 , ' @entity13 told reporters			1
' why ? because they ’re trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year 's elections			0
' adding fuel to @entity13 's contention , a top @entity5 aide used the ' i ' word on friday during a @entity139 breakfast event , tying the threat of impeachment to a lawsuit @entity13 is pursuing against the @entity7 administration			1
the legal action , @entity144 said , has ' opened the door ' to a presidential impeachment			0
' impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent @entity4 vice presidential nominee and others in a very un-serious way , ' said @entity144 , hat - tipping former @entity153 governor @entity152			2
' we take it very seriously and i do n't think it would be a good thing			0
' @entity152 said of @entity7 just days ago in @entity157 that ' if he 's not impeachable , then no one is			0
' @entity13 has said plainly that his lawsuit , which focuses on the @entity5 's unilateral changes to the @entity162 law , is not a prelude to removing @entity7 from power			1
' this is not about impeachment , ' the @entity5 speaker said on july 9			0
' this is about faithfully executing the laws of our country			0
' he added a more definitive statement on tuesday , saying that the @entity5 leadership has ' no plans to impeach the president			2
we have no future plans			0

the @entity5 would first bring charges against @entity7 and vote to approve them			2
the @entity190 would then hold a trial on those charges and vote on whether to convict			0
the @entity184 reserves impeachment as a remedy for ' high crimes and misdemeanors , ' which the framers understood to be official crimes committed while in power			0
@entity13 and other @entity5 leaders have tried to tamp down conservative @entity4 ' expectations in recent weeks			1
a senior @entity5 staffer told @entity202 that tuesday 's words would be welcome in establishment circles since @entity3 ' control of the @entity190 makes removing @entity7 from office a guaranteed non-starter			1
' it should n't have taken this long for him to say it , but now that he 's said it we can get back to things that wo n't backfire , ' the aide said			2
