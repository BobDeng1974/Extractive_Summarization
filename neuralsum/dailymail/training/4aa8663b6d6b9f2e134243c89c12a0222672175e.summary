' we stood up for this because different voices -- even if they 're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place , ' explained @entity0			2
' @entity7 has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas			2
we follow the laws in each country , but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world			0
' the idea for the day came after @entity53 decided to censor a not - so - flattering rendering of the prophet on their show @entity57			0
this act was deemed illegal under @entity6 law , where it is a crime to defile the ' sacred name of @entity12			1
