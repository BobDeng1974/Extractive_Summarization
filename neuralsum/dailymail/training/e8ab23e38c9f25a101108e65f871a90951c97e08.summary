by @entity0 while beards have never been more fashionable , a new survey reveals that almost half of men can not even grow a proper one			0
as many as 45 per cent of men complain that they have bald patches in their beard or sideburns and as a result , men are increasingly getting their beards and sideburns bolstered with hair transplants			1
these men are splashing out £ 4,000 on beard and sideburn transplants to copy the more hirsute look favoured by stars like @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
according to the @entity24 , more than 4,500 facial hair transplants were carried out in the @entity25 last year - that 's more than three times as popular as nose jobs			1
celebrity inspirations : men are splashing out £ 4,000 on beard and sideburn transplants in an attempt to emulate @entity21 ( left ) and @entity20 but how does it work ? hair is taken from the back of the scalp in a strip and transplanted into the bald patches of the beard or the sideburn			1
dr @entity40 , a surgeon at @entity41 in @entity42 , said he has seen a 25 per cent increase in the number of procedures over the last three years as beards have become more fashionable			0
' a proper , full - grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries			0
but the sad truth is that many men in @entity25 struggle to grow beards , sideburns and moustaches			0
before and after : hair is taken from the back of the scalp in a strip and transplanted into the bald patches of the beard or the sideburn ' they have significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy and unconvincing			1
' their problems can be easily remedied with a transplant			0
we can fill out the areas on their face where there are gaps and they can adopt whatever look they like : a bushy moustache , big sideburns like @entity73 or the sexy designer stubble or beards often sported by @entity22 or @entity20			0
facial hair transplants work in the same way as hair transplants performed to the patient ’s head , using a technique called @entity83 ( or @entity83 )			2
this is a minimally invasive transplant technique , which is carried out under local anaesthetic			0
the procedure involves taking individual hairs from an area on the head where the hair is plentiful , and transplanting these hairs into the areas on the face that the patient would like to target			0
a standard @entity83 facial hair transplant procedure can last many hours , depending on the number of hairs which require transplanting & is performed under a local anaesthetic			2
the number of hairs required will be assessed by a hair transplant surgeon and this will depend on the density the patient is looking for			0
' men see people @entity22 and want to copy his look			0
he does all kinds of interesting things with his facial hair			2
he 'll wear a full beard one month , designer stubble the next and we 've also seen him with a moustache and clean - shaven			1
' he cleverly uses his facial hair to completely change his image - it is part of what makes him such an enduring style icon			1
' dr @entity40 , who has carried out two hair transplants on @entity118 star @entity117 , explained that patchy facial hair was a genetic problem			2
' if the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair			2
' it is why men in @entity130 countries often have strong beards - it simply runs through one generation to the next			0
' dr @entity134 , @entity135 at @entity136 , added : ' facial hair transplants are continuing to grow in popularity , particularly as we see beards coming back into fashion			1
' men who choose to undergo facial hair transplants are often cash rich , time poor , working men who want to look their best and are looking for effective , long lasting results			1
' a facial hair transplant is a good option for men who do have facial hair but would like it to be thicker or fuller or to achieve a desirable shape of beard			1
' we expect the demand to grow as it is a walk in walk out procedure with minimal downtime			0
' the poll also revealed that 59 per cent of men said that a beard made them feel more macho			2
while a beard can boost a man 's self - esteem , it does very little for his sex appeal , according to women			0
two - thirds of women said they preferred the clean - shaven look to a beard			1
style icon : men see people @entity22 , who constantly changes his facial hair style , and want to copy his look - seeing numbers of beard transplants shoot to 4,500 in the @entity25			1

men inspired by @entity22 who constantly changes his facial hair
