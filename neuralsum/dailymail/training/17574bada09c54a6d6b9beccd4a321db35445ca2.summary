by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 12 september 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 12 september 2013 scientists have found new evidence that suggests the earliest fully modern humans arrived in the @entity4 around 42,000 - years - ago			1
an international team of researchers radiocarbon dated marine shells found at a key archaeological site in @entity10 , which allowed them to calculate the oldest fossil from the same sequence of archaeological layers is between 42,400 and 41,700 - years - old			1
the shell beads found at @entity15 are significant as they are roughly the same age as the earliest fossils of modern humans found in @entity19 , which enables scientists to explore ' intriguing new possibilities ' about the routes taken by the earliest modern humans out of @entity22			1
beads from the site of @entity15 , @entity10 , found closely associated with the skeleton of an early modern girl dating to between 39,000 to 41,000 years ago			2
the beads ( pictured ) are made of shells of small marine snails as well as a @entity31 shell in the centre , preserved with bright red pigmentation the team , led by the @entity36 , radiocarbon dated 20 marine shells from the top 15 metres of archaeological layers at @entity15 , north of @entity39			1
the shells were perforated , which indicates they were used as beads for body or clothes decoration by modern humans			1
neanderthals , who were living in the same region before them , were not making such beads , according to the scientists			0
the study , published in journal @entity52 , confirms that the shell beads are only linked to the parts of the sequence assigned to modern humans and shows that through direct radiocarbon dating they are between 41,000 - 35,000 years old			2
scientists radiocarbon dated 20 marine shells from the top 15 metres of archaeological layers at @entity15 , north of @entity39 in @entity10 scientists and historians consider the @entity5 to be a key region in prehistory and academics have long speculated about the routes taken by early humans out of @entity22 because it lies at the crossroads of three continents – @entity22 , @entity71 and @entity19			1
it was widely believed that at some point around 45,000 years ago , early modern humans arrived in @entity19 , taking routes out of @entity22 through the @entity4 and from there travelled along the @entity78 rim or the @entity79			1
however , this dating evidence suggests populations of early modern humans arrived in @entity19 and the @entity4 at roughly the same time , sparking a new debate about where the first populations of early humans travelled from in their expansion towards @entity19 and which alternative routes they may have taken			1
several human remains were found in the @entity10 rock shelter in @entity15 when it was first excavated 75 years ago			1
but sadly , the most complete skeleton of a young girl thought to be between seven and nine - years - old , who was buried at the back of the shelter , has disappeared			0
fragments of a second individual found next to the girl have also been lost			0
however , the team was able to calculate the age of the lost fossil at 40,800 to 39,200 years old , taking into account its location in the sequence of archaeological layers in relation to the marine shell beads			0
another fossil of a recently rediscovered fragment of an upper jaw of a woman , now located in a museum in @entity39 , had insufficient collagen to be dated by radiocarbon methods			0
but a method using statistical modelling was used to date by association the jaw fragment at 42,400 to 41,700 years old			0
the excavations at @entity15 in 1938 showing workers digging at 17 metres below the surface			0
a chief archaeologist examines their finds from above ( shown here in the middle right of the picture wearing a hat ) @entity15 is one of the most important @entity127 sites in @entity128 and consists of a 23 metre deep sequence of archaeological layers that have been undisturbed for thousands of years until a team of @entity134 @entity133 priests excavated a rock shelter in 1937 and revisited it 10 years later			0
the cave layers were found to contain the human fossils and hundreds of shell beads , as well as thousands of stone tools and broken bones of hunted and consumed animals			2
study lead author dr @entity142 , from the @entity143 at the @entity36 , said : ‘ this is a region where scholars have been expecting to find early evidence of anatomically and behaviourally modern humans , like us , leaving @entity22 and directly replacing @entity150 populations that lived there for more than 150,000 years			2
it was believed early modern humans arrived in @entity19 45,000 years ago , taking routes out of @entity22 through the @entity4 , and then along the @entity78 rim or the @entity79 ( pictured in modern times )			1
but the new evidence suggests early modern humans arrived in @entity19 and the @entity4 at roughly the same time ' the human fossils at @entity15 appear to be of a similar age to fossils in other @entity19 contexts			1
it is possible that instead of the @entity4 being the single point of origin for modern humans heading for @entity19 , they may also have used other routes too			2
' a maritime route across the @entity78 has been proposed although evidence is scarce			0
a wealth of archaeological data now pinpoints the plains of @entity71 as a particularly important but relatively unknown region which requires further investigation			0
’ the earliest @entity19 modern fossil , from @entity175 , is thought to be between 42,000 and 38,000 years old and specialists have estimated the age of @entity179 's @entity178 from southern @entity180 , between 44,000 to 41,000 years and that of two milk teeth in southern @entity183 , at 45,000 to 43,000 years old			0
the new dating evidence from @entity15 is largely comparable to these ages , if not slightly younger .			0

the @entity36 used radiocarbon *techniques* to date marine shells found at @entity15 , @entity10 which allowed them to date human remains
the shells were perforated , which indicates they were used as beads for body or clothes decoration by modern humans
new evidence suggests populations of modern humans arrived in @entity19 and the @entity4 at roughly the same time
this has sparked debate about where early humans travelled from in their expansion towards @entity19 and the alternative routes they may have taken
