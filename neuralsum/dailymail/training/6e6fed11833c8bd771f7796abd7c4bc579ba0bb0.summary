by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:39 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:04 est , 31 december 2013 in an ancient manuscript dating back more than 800 years , a historian has discovered what is believed to be designs for the first ever robot			1
@entity8 of @entity9 was written around 1206 and features a total of 174 automated and mechanical drawings			1
using these ancient drawings , historian @entity12 has now successfully managed to recreate one of these designs called ‘ the ' hand - washing automaton			1
using these ancient drawings , historian @entity12 has successfully managed to recreate one of these designs called the ' hand - washing automaton , ' pictured @entity21 was a @entity23 polymath who lived during the @entity25			1
he was a mechanical engineer and mathematician and designed various systems all powered by the flow and movement of water			1
many of these designs featured in his 13th century manuscripts , including @entity8 of @entity9			1
the book features fifty mechanical devices and systems , grouped into six chapters			2
the devices include water and candle clocks , pitchers and basins for phlebotomy and cleansing before prayers , shape - changing fountains , machines powered by water and vessels for drinking			1
each device is called a ‘ shakl ’ and is depicted by graphical drawings and simple annotations that explain how each shakl would work			2
this automaton is a water - powered system that helps the user wash their hands			2
once the water stops running , a cut - out figure presents the user with a towel			0
according to a video on the @entity65 , @entity12 enlisted the help of @entity67 , a designer from @entity68 , to create the device and demonstrated that it works effectively			2
@entity12 got the idea after researching the work of @entity73 inventor @entity21			1
@entity21 was a @entity23 polymath who lived during the @entity25			2
he was a mechanical engineer and mathematician and designed various systems all powered by the flow and movement of water			2
many of these designs featured in his 13th century manuscripts , including @entity8 of @entity9			1
the book features fifty mechanical devices and systems , grouped into six chapters			0
the original ' hand - washing automaton ' design by @entity90 that features in his 1206 manuscript the devices include water and candle clocks , pitchers and basins for phlebotomy and cleansing before prayers , shape - changing fountains , machines powered by water and vessels for drinking			1
each device is called a ‘ shakl ’ and is depicted by graphical drawings and simple annotations that explain how each shakl would work			0
complicated devices were broken down into more detailed drawings , with various components highlighted			0
@entity21 included a total of 174 drawings in the manuscript , each with instructions on how to build them , with various parts highlighted using different letters of the @entity121 alphabet – similar to how flat pack furniture manuals are presented			0
other @entity21 designs include a musical robot band , also called ‘ a musical automaton ’ , which featured four musicians on a boat that floated on a lake to entertain guests			1
other @entity21 designs include a musical robot band , which featured four musicians on a boat that floated on a lake to entertain guests , pictured			1
it featured a programmable drum machine with pegs that moved into levers that operated the percussion another water - powered design was the elephant clock , pictured , that would bang a drum every half an hour as a bucket was filled and emptied with water professor @entity146 from the @entity147 recreated a model , based on @entity21 ’s design , which featured a programmable drum machine with pegs that moved into levers that operated the percussion			1
the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and patterns if the pegs were moved to different locations on the boat			0
another was the elephant clock			0
according to the designs , a bucket of water was hidden inside a model elephant that took half an hour to fill			0
as the bucket sinks with the weight of the water , it pulls a string attached to a see - saw on top of the clock			0
a swinging see - saw swings releases a ball that drops into the mouth of a model snake , causing the snake to tip forward			0
the bucket is attached to the tail of the snake and as the snake swings , the bucket is removed from the water			0
it then slowly begins to fill up again over the course of another 30 minutes			0
when this happens , a figure hits a drum to indicate the hour or half - hour mark			0
a working replica was built for @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192 , while another can be found in the @entity194 , @entity195 , in @entity196 , @entity197 .			0

book of *knowledge* of @entity9 was written in 1206
it is one of the earliest known manuscripts to detail robotic systems
all the mechanisms in the book were designed by @entity73 inventor @entity21
the ' hand - washing automaton ’ design could have *replaced* a *servant*
a set designer and historian recreated the device using @entity21 ’s design
other designs include a candle clock and a four - piece robotic band
