@entity1 leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the @entity5 – with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols			1
after years of dithering , an emergency @entity1 summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone			1
within days , @entity20 warship @entity18 and the @entity23 supply ship @entity21 are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the @entity1 's belated commitment to the cause			1
prime minister @entity28 , who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue , stressed that @entity20 was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the @entity20			1
@entity34 prime minister @entity33 , whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea , called the @entity1 measures ' a giant step forward			1
' but other @entity1 leaders were less optimistic , with @entity44 's prime minister , @entity43 , saying the assets being proposed would ' never be enough ' to address the problem			1
' a giant step forward ' : @entity34 prime minister @entity33 speaks after @entity1 leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols jovial : @entity57 prime minister @entity56 and her @entity20 counterpart @entity28 embrace before posing for a family photo during a @entity1 leaders summit in @entity61 the pledge of resources came as victims of the worst - ever migrant disaster in the @entity5 were buried thursday in @entity44			1
two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off @entity68 that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service			0
none of the bodies was identified : one casket had ' no 132 ' scrawled on it , referring to the number of the dna sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it			0
for several years as death tolls mounted , @entity1 leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action			2
when @entity68 disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader @entity89 and unrest spread in neighboring countries , @entity87 failed to take forceful action			0
yesterday , @entity1 leaders pledged to do more , committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need			2
other member states , from @entity99 to @entity100 , also lined up more ships , planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants			2
the member states agreed to triple funding to € 9million ( £ 7m ) a month for the @entity1 's border operation that patrols the @entity5			1
seek and destroy : @entity20 will send one of its biggest warships , @entity111 ( above ) , to the @entity5 within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers escalating crisis : a migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the @entity34 @entity119 at the port of @entity121 after being rescued by the tanker @entity123 along with 545 other refugees in the @entity5 they also assigned @entity1 foreign policy chief @entity126 to line up the diplomatic options that would allow @entity1 militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers			1
officials said the lack of a strong @entity68 government would likely make @entity135 backing necessary			0
' leaders have already pledged significantly greater support , including many more vessels , aircraft and experts ' than had been anticipated before the summit , @entity1 president @entity136 said			2
despite the sudden deluge of goodwill , huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers			2
' right now , it 's a question of fixing yesterday 's errors , ' @entity99 president @entity149 said			0
he said the @entity1 would hold a summit in @entity44 with @entity154 countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years			2
in contrast to the @entity34 premier , the head of another @entity5 nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic			1
for tiny @entity44 , the smallest @entity1 member state with a population of 450,000 , the summit produced nothing particularly new , apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks			2
the assets being proposed ' will never be enough , ' @entity44 's prime minister , @entity43 said			1
' it is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by			0
' on the offensive : @entity1 foreign policy chief @entity126 ( pictured ) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow @entity1 militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers in the past week alone , more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between @entity34 and @entity68 as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $ 2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing			1
at least 1,300 people have died in april alone , putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever			0
ending that is @entity87 's main challenge			0
even optimists say any measures agreed at thursday 's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the @entity5			1
but @entity200 prime minister @entity199 insisted that @entity87 should not take the brunt of blame			1
' we also ask that @entity154 , the source of the problem , also collectively takes up its responsibility , ' @entity199 said			0
' last time i checked @entity68 was in @entity154 , not @entity87			0
' @entity23 chancellor @entity209 and @entity99 president @entity149 arrive at an @entity1 emergency summit in @entity61 seeking a solution to the migrants crisis over the past year , what little political structure @entity68 had has collapsed			1
there are two rival governments , neither with any real authority , and each fighting the other on the ground			0
local militias hold sway around the country , some of them with hard - line @entity224 ideologies , and the @entity226 group has emerged as a strong and brutal force			0
the makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated			0
' any kind of military action can only be based on international law , ' said @entity23 chancellor @entity209			2
' there are two possibilities : either a @entity239 or a unity government in @entity68			0
we have neither at the moment			0
' @entity87 itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants			0
countries like @entity23 , @entity249 , @entity99 and @entity34 have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and @entity253 member states take hardly any			1
five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in			0
still , despite the differences , @entity258 's prime minister @entity257 was hopeful that this time @entity87 could put up a show of solidarity			1
' i hope we 'll get it right this time , ' he said .			0

@entity266 *increased* to £ 7m a month for @entity1 's border patrols in @entity5
plans lined up for @entity1 militaries to strike against boats used by traffickers
@entity20 warship and @entity23 supply ship heading to the region within days
@entity34 prime minister @entity33 called measures ' a giant step forward '
