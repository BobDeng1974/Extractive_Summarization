@entity0 today warned @entity1 that time is running out on her offer to help lock the @entity4 out of power			1
the @entity7 leader has said she is prepared to work with @entity8 to put mr @entity1 in @entity9 , even if @entity11 's conservatives win more seats			1
ms @entity0 was today swamped with requests for selfies in the wake of her triumph in last week 's live tv debate , as polls suggest a surge in support for the @entity7 will cost @entity8 a majority on may 7			1
ms @entity0 has refused to work with the conservatives under any circumstances , but has held out the possibility of putting mr @entity1 into power			1
she has suggested a full - blown coalition , with @entity7 ministers in the @entity36 , is unlikely to be the outcome			2
but her mps could vote to prop up a @entity8 minority administration , raising the prospect of a @entity26 - backed government over-ruling the views of a majority in @entity44			2
labour leader @entity1 is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the @entity7 after a sharp drop in support in @entity26 however , today ms @entity0 made clear he patience is wearing thin , and called on mr @entity1 to respond to her offer			1
she claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that mr @entity1 would rather see the @entity31 return to government than work with the @entity7			1
addressing supporters in @entity56 , ms @entity0 insisted the @entity7 is not seeking any @entity58 ministerial posts			1
but said she will fight for as much power for @entity26 as she can get			0

ms @entity0 said : ' even if the @entity4 are the largest party , i have said we will vote to stop the @entity31 government getting off the ground , ' she said			1
' i have asked @entity1 to confirm that @entity8 will do likewise			1
thus far , @entity8 has n't given that commitment			2
' i hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that @entity8 would rather see the @entity4 get back into power than work with the @entity7			1
' if that is the case , then people in @entity26 , i do n't think , will ever forgive the @entity8			2
' she added : ' i have said a formal coalition with @entity8 is unlikely			2
' the @entity7 is not going to @entity82 to seek ministerial posts , we 're going to @entity82 to make @entity26 's voice heard and to win more progressive policies for @entity26			2
' now , i 've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the @entity4 , but i have also said to @entity8 , very directly , if there is an @entity90 majority in the @entity91 , then even if the @entity4 are the biggest party , if @entity8 and the @entity7 work together we can stop a @entity31 government getting off the ground			1
' i repeat that call to @entity1 today , and maybe today unlike the previous few days he will answer that			0
' if we have an @entity90 majority , will he work with the @entity7 rather than allow @entity11 back into @entity98 ?

' if @entity26 is to become independent , that will only happen with a vote in a referendum , ' she said			0
' but poll after poll shows that people in @entity26 want significantly more powers in the @entity133			0
' now , i will not stop campaigning for and wanting @entity26 to become independent , but that will only happen in a referendum			0
' @entity138 president sir @entity137 called on ms @entity0 to make clear whether she still supports the reversal of welfare changes made since 2010			0
he said : ' the @entity7 need to come clean			0
are they planning to reverse welfare changes since 2010 ? ' this is what they have spent five years telling people			0
