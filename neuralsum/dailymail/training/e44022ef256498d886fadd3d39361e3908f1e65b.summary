by @entity0 published : 18:41 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 01:41 est , 18 october 2012 @entity1 yesterday defended sending millions in aid money to a controversial @entity4 dictator - just hours after the @entity5 accused his regime of masterminding a bloody rebellion led by a wanted war criminal			1
the prime minister said the government was right to restore £ 16 million of aid to @entity12 - hailing the regime led by president @entity14 as a ‘ role model for development ’			2
the decision , made by beleaguered chief whip @entity18 on his final day as international development secretary last month , has angered the @entity20 and caused dismay among other @entity23 donors and human rights activists			1
defence : prime minister @entity1 ( left , yesterday ) said the government was right to restore £ 16million of aid to @entity12 - hailing the regime led by president @entity14 ( right ) as a ' role model for development ' but mr @entity1 , who has built up a close personal relationship with @entity14 , insisted that @entity12 remained a ‘ success story ’ , despite mounting alarm at the regime ’s dire human rights record			1
speaking in the @entity36 he said : ‘ i am clear , @entity12 has been , and continues to be , a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty in @entity4			0
‘ i am proud of the fact that the last government , and this government , have continued to invest in that success			0
’ mr @entity1 said he had been ‘ frank and firm ’ with @entity14 about alleged human rights abuses , but said it was ‘ right ’ to continue pouring aid into his regime			1
his comments came as a devastating @entity5 report accused @entity56 of effectively masterminding a murderous rebellion in the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) which has forced half a million people from their homes			1
@entity62 called for the immediate suspension of aid to the @entity12 government , saying the prime minister ’s comments displayed a ‘ worrying level of ignorance ’ about the situation in east @entity4			0
the leaked report said the uprising by the so - called @entity74 rebels was receiving ‘ direct military orders ’ from @entity12 ’s army chief and @entity14 ’s defence minister			2
the rebellion is led on the ground by @entity81 warlord @entity80 , who is wanted by the @entity82 for alleged war crimes			0
rebels are accused of recruiting child soldiers , waging a campaign of terror against civilians and government forces and attacking @entity5 peacekeepers sent to the region			2
unhappy : shadow international development secretary @entity92 said the @entity5 allegations of ' @entity12 's continued support for militia activity in @entity59 raise further questions ' about @entity18 's decision ‘ @entity12 officials exercise overall command and strategic planning for @entity74 , ’ the @entity5 report said			1
‘ @entity12 continues to violate the arms embargo through direct military support to @entity74 rebels , facilitation of recruitment , encouragement and facilitation of @entity81 army desertions as well as the provision of arms and ammunition , intelligence , and political advice			0
’ controversial : the decision to restore aid was made by chief whip @entity18 on his final day as international development secretary last month @entity14 has also been accused of running an increasingly authoritarian regime within @entity12			1
human rights organisations allege that political opponents and journalists have been tortured , murdered and imprisoned as @entity14 seeks to tighten his grip			1
the report is acutely embarrassing for @entity125 high command which has established close personal links with the @entity14 regime			2
mr @entity1 used an ongoing voluntary project in @entity12 to help ‘ detoxify ’ the party ’s image in the run - up to the election , and @entity14 was even invited by mr @entity1 to address the party ’s annual conference in 2007			1
the new report will pile pressure on ministers to explain mr @entity18 ’s decision to release £ 16 million in aid to @entity12 , half of which will go directly into the @entity14 regime ’s coffers			1
other donors , such as the @entity145 and the @entity146 , have refused to lift aid bans imposed in the summer after an interim @entity5 report first revealed evidence of @entity12 ’s involvement in the bloodshed in the @entity59			0
mr @entity18 is reported to have overruled the advice of both the @entity20 and his own officials to restore the aid programme			1
his successor @entity155 has also indicated she is unhappy with the decision and will freeze the next tranche of aid to @entity12 due in december			0
foreign office minister @entity159 this week said the @entity160 remained ‘ very concerned by continuing reports of @entity12 support for the @entity74 rebels ’			0
new role : mr @entity18 's successor @entity155 has also indicated she is unhappy with the decision and will freeze the next tranche of aid to @entity12 due in december labour last night called for the immediate suspension of aid to the @entity12 government			2
shadow international development secretary @entity92 said : ‘ the latest @entity5 allegations of @entity12 ’s continued support for militia activity in @entity59 raise further questions about @entity18 ’s seemingly arbitrary decision to reinstate aid to @entity12 on his last day in office			1
' i am clear , @entity12 has been , and continues to be , a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty in @entity4 ' prime minister @entity1 ‘ @entity1 ’s answer at @entity1 ’s questions demonstrates a worrying level of ignorance about these serious allegations			0
‘ the @entity192 , @entity145 , @entity146 and other donors have maintained their suspension of aid leaving the @entity160 isolated and responsible for undermining a coherent international position			0
’ foreign aid accounts for more than 40 per cent of the @entity12 government ’s income , and @entity160 is the country ’s single biggest donor , giving £ 75 million this year			0
the @entity12 government yesterday strongly denied the allegations in the @entity5 report			0
a senior @entity12 diplomat accused the @entity5 of pursuing a ‘ political agenda ’ .			2

@entity5 accused @entity14 's regime of masterminding a bloody rebellion
but @entity1 insists decision made by @entity18 last month was correct
it angered @entity20 and caused dismay among human rights activists
