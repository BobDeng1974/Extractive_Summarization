thousands of academy schools are ‘ not helping our kids ’ and could be forced back under council control by @entity5 , @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the @entity5 leader hit out at the ‘ alphabet soup ’ of school structures , including academies , which were championed by @entity10 , and free schools , which were introduced by the @entity12			1
in comments that appeared to go much further than @entity5 ’s official policy , mr @entity0 suggested all schools should be placed back under local bureaucrats			1
mr @entity0 ’s comments came during a question and answer session with local people in @entity21 , near @entity22 - the first in a series of ‘ @entity25 ’ events the @entity5 leader is planning in the run - up to the election			1
mr @entity0 said : ' you have got to have proper local accountability			1
you can not run thousands of schools from @entity33 ' during a question and answer session in @entity21 near @entity22 responding to a question from a representative of the @entity38 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ the alphabet soup of different kinds of schools - free schools , academies , trust schools and all that - is not helping our kids			1
‘ you have got to have proper local accountability			0
you can not run thousands of schools from @entity33 - @entity47 has certainly proved that			1
you ca n’t run all these schools from central government			2
’ mr @entity0 then posed for pictures with @entity38 rep @entity52 , a primary school teacher , while holding a copy of the militant union ’s education ‘ manifesto ’			1
the document calls for all state - funded schools to be put back under the control of local councils			0
it also calls for an end to free schools , and urges a cap on teachers ’ working hours , as well as making numerous demands for more funding			2
self - governance is a key feature of academy and free schools , which supporters say gives them the freedom to innovate and drive through improvements without council interference or bureaucracy			0
@entity5 ’s @entity77 shadow education secretary , @entity76 , has adopted a much more positive approach to academies than his leader			2
mr @entity76 has said @entity5 would not approve any more free schools , but would introduce a new class of ‘ parent - led academies ’ - potentially adding to the ‘ alphabet soup ’ attacked by mr @entity0 yesterday			1
mr @entity76 has also proposed the introduction of local ‘ directors of standards ’ to keep tabs on academy and free schools and encourage greater co-operation			2
but he has not suggested they should be placed fully back under local authority control			0
a @entity94 spokesman last night said mr @entity0 ’s comments left @entity5 ’s education policy in ‘ complete chaos ’			1
he added : ‘ they have no plan to raise standards in our schools			2
in fact , we now know that @entity0 wants to turn the clock back and undo everything that has been achieved under this government			2
‘ as a result of our plan for education and the success of our free schools and academies programme , a million more children are being taught in good and outstanding schools , 100,000 more six year - olds are on course to become confident readers and parents have more choice than ever before			0
' @entity5 would put all of this progress at risk because they are driven by the interests of the unions rather than those of pupils and parents			0
’ @entity47 ( pictured at @entity126 in @entity127 , south @entity128 in 2011 when he was @entity129 ) has certainly proven that schools ' can not ' be run ' from central government ' , according to mr @entity0 a @entity5 source yesterday said there was no change of policy and said mr @entity0 was simply re-stating his position			1
in a separate development , mr @entity0 said @entity5 plans to offer a pay boost to thousands of workers providing care to the elderly			1
‘ when we are talking about one of the most important jobs in our society , it is also one of the worst - paid jobs in our society - that is looking after elderly people			0
’ we are going to have more to say about this in the coming weeks - about how we can do more for those people doing that really important job of looking after elderly people			0
a @entity5 source confirmed the party is examining ways to boost the pay of care workers , but was unable to provide details of what the new policy would mean			0
the party has previously criticised the practice of offering 15 - minute care appointments in people ’s homes , where carers are often not paid for the time spent travelling between appointments			0
‘ these people do an important job and do n’t get a fair deal			0
we are going to do something about that , ’ a source said .			0
