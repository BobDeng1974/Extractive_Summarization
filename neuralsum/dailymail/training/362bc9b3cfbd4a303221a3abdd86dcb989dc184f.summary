and earlier this week , chancellor @entity46 likened his @entity13 counterpart @entity47 to @entity49 ’s @entity48 for refusing to accept the recovery is gaining momentum			2
thumbs down : mr @entity1 's satisfaction rating is now at the low levels seen when @entity4 was @entity7 leader bad omen : mr @entity1 's ratings are as low as those seen when @entity4 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) lead the @entity7 party the poll shows that only @entity60 is more unpopular than mr @entity1 , with a net satisfaction rating of minus 40 per cent , down five points over the past month			1
@entity63 has a rating of minus 20 , down three points ; although most @entity7 voters remain satisfied with his leadership			2
the most popular party leader is @entity69 of @entity70 , although his net satisfaction rating is still minus seven , and more than a third say they did not know what they thought of him			1

leadership : just 24 per cent of voters are satisfied with mr @entity1 , the same as @entity60 pressure : among those intending to vote , the @entity13 leader is now down to just three points just one in five ( 19 per cent ) think the @entity13 leader has got a lot of personality , compared to 40 per cent who say the same of mr @entity63			1
however , mr @entity63 did worse on some questions – he is seen as more out of touch than other leaders , and eight in 10 believe he looks after some sections of society more than others			0
both mr @entity63 and mr @entity60 are seen as having more style than substance			0
overall , @entity13 ’s support stands at 37 per cent , down three points ; with the @entity101 on 34 per cent , up four			1
the @entity102 are on 10 per cent – below @entity70 on 11 per cent			0

‘ @entity63 maintains his lead on key prime ministerial qualities on being capable and good in a crisis – although remains vulnerable on being seen as out of touch			0
