by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 27 november 2012 two hundred thousand homes at high risk of flooding could be left without insurance cover because of a row between the government and insurers			1
more than 900 homes , mainly in the @entity9 , have been deluged by flooding since last wednesday in addition to around 3,000 homes flooded during heavy rains over the summer			2
ministers and the insurance industry have so far failed to reach an agreement over how to provide affordable cover to vulnerable homes , despite negotiating for two years			1
row : more than 200,000 homes at high risk of flooding could become uninsurable if the @entity6 and the industry fail to strike a deal anger : environment minister @entity23 has accused the insurance industry of trying to take advantage of the situation in flood - hit @entity27 under a previous deal , most homes which will never experience floods pay a ‘ small sum ’ on their insurance premiums to subsidise cover for high - risk homes			1
but this is due to expire next year			0
insurers , who are furious that the @entity37 has cut its flood budget by £ 400million despite nearly one in five homes being at risk , said the @entity6 had rejected their proposals for a new settlement			1
@entity44 , of the @entity45 , warned that the negotiations had reached ‘ crisis point ’			1
he said : ‘ we ’ve had two years to sort this out – during that time the insurance industry ’s put a massive amount of work and money into coming up with an insurance - led solution , and we seem to have reached an impasse			2
‘ i should say first that our members are out there looking after people who have been affected by these tragic floods , and that means we want a solution even more now after the difficult events of the weekend			0
’ insurers have put forward plans for a @entity65 which would be made up of levies on insurance premiums			0
they have also asked for more public cash to be injected into a temporary ‘ overdraft ’ to pay out for claims during the current flooding crisis			1
claims average £ 20,000 to £ 40,000 per flooded home			0
they say this overdraft would be paid back by the insurance industry next year when the scheme has built up cash reserves			2
mr @entity44 said : ‘ we ’ve had floods all this year , and it ’s quite clear that what in the past was an exception is now becoming the norm			0
’ should the government step in to help uninsured homeowners hit by floods ? environment secretary @entity88 , who visited flood - hit areas of @entity90 yesterday , accused the industry of ‘ opportunism ’ for raising the issue in public while the talks were still on - going			2
he said there had been ‘ constructive and detailed discussions ’ up until the end of last week and that he was looking forward to looking at the latest proposals			0
ministers are worried about further hikes to premiums , which analysts predict could rise by up to 10 per cent from 2014 under such a deal			0
the @entity106 government and the insurance industry agreed a statement of principles in 2000 , which forces insurers to cover homes in flood - prone areas , but it expires in june 2013			1
painful : a woman wades through flood water near @entity114 at the weekend but a deal to make sure every home at flood risk is insured expires next june high waters : insurers have to pay - out around £ 3billion in claims during extreme flooding and want @entity6 backing going forward if no new agreement is reached , households in flood - risk areas would be left at the mercy of the market and around 200,000 homeowners would not be able to secure or afford any insurance at all leaving them unable to sell or re-mortgage their homes			1
@entity131 , @entity106 ’s environment spokesman , urged ministers to secure a deal with insurers to provide universal flood cover			0
