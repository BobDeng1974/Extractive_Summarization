by @entity0 running my eyes over the rail of dark designer trouser suits and crisp shirts , i feel a frisson of pleasure			1
their square shoulders and precise cuts speak of power , poise and sexual confidence			1
but this is n’t my partner ’s wardrobe i ’m rifling through — it ’s mine			1
dressing like a man has long been my style secret			2
ninety per cent of the time i ’m the one wearing the trousers — teamed with a shirt , a blazer and loafers or brogues			1
dressing like a man : @entity0 is in style heaven wearing designer trousers and crisp shirts though it might sound strange to some , dressing like a man has always made me feel like more of a woman			1
in the workplace , it imbues you with instant authority			2
outside , it has a coquettish charm many men are unable to resist			2
and after a decade in the fashion doldrums , i ’m back in style heaven			2
according to @entity46 , sales of trouser suits have soared 157 per cent in recent months , fuelled by designers such as @entity48 , whose recent collection was filled with slouchy , silky trouser suits in cream and navy			1
@entity54 ’s tuxedo - suited turn at the @entity55 and model - of - the - moment @entity58 ’s prediliction for androgynous dressing have also sparked the comeback			1
last month saw the launch of 56 - year - old model @entity64 ’s collaboration with @entity65 , championing low - key , boyish style			2
@entity58 rocks a suit at the @entity70 dinner to celebrate the launch of the @entity72 i ’m not trying to make a feminist statement by the way i dress			1
it ’s simply that to feel my most feminine , i need to feel comfortable			2
trussed up in a constricting bodycon dress , i feel victim instead of master of my clothes			2
men ’s clothing , with its clever tailoring tricks , is far more flattering			2
my love affair with dressing more like a boy than a girl began in the @entity86 , when androgyny was first in vogue			2
i ’d been a conservative dresser in my late teens and early 20s — all cashmere sweaters and printed scarves			0
by the time my first marriage came to an end when i was 25 , i was ready to establish a style of my own			0
working at @entity96 , i began to spend time with artists and designers			0
i had my hair cropped , swapped @entity103 ’s trendy @entity102 boutiques for school outfitters where i could buy striped blazers , and ditched the women ’s department for the men ’s to stock up on spotty bow ties			0
a style of her own : working at @entity96 , @entity0 cropped her hair and ditched the women 's department for the men 's soon , i was modelling myself on @entity115 , @entity117 ’s character in the @entity119 film of the same name			1
@entity121 was feisty , funny and feminine — despite dressing like she ’d stolen her clothes from her brother ’s wardrobe			0
when the designer @entity126 opened a @entity128 shop selling corduroy trousers , knitted waistcoats and striped shirts for women , her expensive emporium became my spiritual home			1
i was prepared to spend a week ’s pay on a shirt			0
no man in whom i invested an iota of interest ever attempted to remodel me as a girly - girl			0
but if the @entity141 were all about androgyny , in the @entity143 a different trend took hold			0
power dressing had less to do with sexual ambiguity than asserting authority — and equality — in the workplace			1
on becoming editor of @entity96 in 1985 , at 32 , i realised that baggy cords and waistcoats were n’t going to cut it			0
i took to tailored trouser suits and knife - sharp shoulder pads			1
i had a designer trouser suit for every day of the week : @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 were my favourites			1
@entity164 's signature style is dresses that cling to her curves in my high - end tailoring , i could knock against the glass ceiling			1
i could stride into a meeting and did n’t have to check on my cleavage when i raised my hand , or sneak a peak under the table to see if my skirt was creeping up			0
jackets and trousers were my passport to power — and i ’ve clung to them ever since			1
and then , about ten years ago , a troubling thing happened			0
girls started dressing for work like they were going out clubbing			0
they were turning up in skyscraper heels , flashes of cleavage , short , tight skirts with splits , and transparent blouses			0
so hurrah , then , for this androgynous revival , which again feels fresh and new			1
on young girls it looks gamine and cute ; on older women it looks polished and smart			0
the @entity194 is awash with masculine style			0
men ’s shirts are back , but in soft fabrics and are less likely to gape across the chest			0
there are great , slim - fitting , on - trend suits at @entity202 and more conservatively cut ones at @entity204			1
if you crave colour , @entity206 ’s well - priced jackets come in sunny yellow , hot pink and sky blue			1
so , @entity164 , @entity212 , @entity213 and the like can cling to clothes that cling to their curves			0
at 61 , i can once again relish being one of the boys .			0

square shoulders and precise cuts speak of sexual confidence

jackets and trousers are a woman 's passport to power
