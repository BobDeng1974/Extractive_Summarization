by @entity0 a neglected dog has been put down by a vet who described it as suffering with the worst case of starvation he had ever seen			2

the dog 's owner , @entity11 , 33 , was summoned to appear at @entity13 , to face charges of animal cruelty , on february 24 , but failed to turn up			1
however , the case was proved in his absence and he was convicted of five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in october 2013			1
his sentencing , held yesterday , has been postponed while further reports are put together for the court			0
warning : graphic content vets and @entity27 workers described @entity28 as suffering with the worst case of starvation they had ever seen fly , left , was so starved vets had to put her down			1
