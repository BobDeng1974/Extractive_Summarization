that 's because the nation 's stars have been booked in to a ' luxury ' hotel that 's been panned online and branded ' appalling ' and smelly by guests			1
the @entity12 in @entity13 will be @entity3 's base for the @entity15 , where @entity16 , @entity17 and co will stay as they prepare for matches			1
smelly : the open drain carrying human waste past the front of the @entity12 in @entity13 @entity3 's base : the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity5 , was booked by the @entity24 but guests say the stench from the open drain that carries raw human waste past the front of it is disgusting and have complained about the rear view of @entity5 's biggest slum			1
the @entity33 , which has been heavily criticised in reviews on online travel site @entity36 , was previously called the @entity37			1
then in 2010 a female guest was killed in its foyer when rival drug gangs fought a gun battle there , @entity38 reported			1
guests have also complained about the dirt - encrusted patio windows , jammed windows , fittings coated in rust and light sockets being wedged into ceiling holes with tissues			1
its rear apartments look out over the @entity54 slum which is home to 70,000 people including some of @entity5 's most notorious gangsters			1
one reviewer , from @entity58 , wrote on @entity36 : ' i am staying here as i write this 26/10/13 in room 809 and i am appalled at the absolutely dirty room they gave me today			2
@entity64 : a broken and rusty door lock on a balcony of the @entity12 luxury ? a light fitting wedged into the ceiling with tissue paper the hotel 's rear apartments look out over the @entity54 slum which is home to 70,000 people ' i could write my name in the mirror and it really was appalling , everything was dirty and covered in dust , this does not happen overnight so it has not been cleaned for a long time or even checked , the 8th floor also smells when you enter it due to lack of cleaning			1
' i will make sure my company ensures that no one stays in this filthy @entity33 again , never mind the @entity86 football team ! ' sorry @entity33 but you really are the worst hotel i have stayed in for over two years , never again			2
' ' in the room , it still seems the last maintenance was last century			2
the door locker is waiting to fall , the windows do n't close completely ... and then , there is the front desk			0
probably the worst customer service in the country , and by some margin			2
nothing royal - a good hotel for @entity101 in the 70s			0
' - @entity103 , @entity104 ' everything you have heard about this place is right - if what you heard was horrible			0
an open sewer outside the place insures that the following is literally true : this hotel stinks ... the carpets were so wretched we gave up doing yoga ... ' - r2croak , @entity114 ' all in all a pretty nerve wrecking place with bad service but expensive in turn			2
unfortunately can not recommend ! ' - @entity119 , @entity120 ' huge deception			0
this hotel has the worst possible internet service ! it has been under works for ages and the pool is just big enough to wash a shirt ... the terrible joke is that it pretends to have 5 * ! ' - @entity130 , @entity131 ' @entity135 ( sic ) not very caring a little attitude i may say , surrounding area is dangerous , the beach dirty some days , my bathroom water came out black a couple of times , would not recommend ' - igr2271 , @entity140 a battered and food - stained old sofa in one of the apartments at the hotel the @entity3 team will stay at needs a revamp : a mottled blue queen anne chair smeared with stains unfinished window fittings at the @entity33 , which has been panned by guests on online review sites another guest , from @entity154 , @entity155 , said : ' i have travelled all over the world			1
i have never stayed anywhere worse			0
' the staff was extremely rude , never helpful			0
they kept billing us for things we never purchased , and when questioned about it , claimed they could not help us			0
' they recommended a driver that charged about five times a cab , then failed to pick us up after dropping us off			0
' the inside of one of the apartments showing a light fitting sticking out of the ceiling not looking good : @entity2 hopeful @entity175 ( left ) and @entity176 star @entity16 face staying in a smelly hotel if they make the team for next year 's @entity2 @entity24 bosses plan to use @entity13 as a central base before and between fixtures at the @entity2			1
@entity3 will find out who they will play and where until the draw for the group stage of the competition on december 6			0
