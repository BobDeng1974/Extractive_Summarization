@entity0 has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the @entity5			1
the video , taken from a plane yesterday , shows the @entity9 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side			1
the 14 - storey booster manages to hit the barge , but its high speed and tilt causes it to explode on impact			1
soon after the launch , billionaire @entity0 founder , @entity26 , tweeted : ' ascent successful			1
@entity31 landed on droneship , but too hard for survival			0
' landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky			0
@entity0 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand			1
the autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft ( 90 by 30 metres ) , with wings that extend its width to 170ft ( 50 metres )			0
@entity26 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year			2
the video , taken from a plane yesterday , shows the the @entity9 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side the booster manages to hit the barge , but its high speed and tilt creates a huge explosion on impact @entity61 has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named ' @entity64 ' in 2019			1
@entity64 will use new engines , mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on - orbit manoeuvres			0
the company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow @entity0 ' launch of @entity9 , which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable			1
the aim of both @entity0 and @entity61 is to end @entity76 dependence on @entity78 - built rocket engines , but the technology has so far proven difficult			1
@entity61 's plan is to skip returning the whole booster , an approach favoured by rival @entity0			1
it hopes to separate the engines after launch , inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air			0
despite being destroyed , the booster 's flyback marks another step in the company 's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown , potentially slashing launch costs			2
' this might change completely how we approach transportation to space , ' @entity0 vice president @entity97 told reporters during a prelaunch press conference			1
the @entity9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb ( 1,950 kg ) of food , clothing and science experiments to the @entity108 - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts			1
the supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on friday			1
the rocket was was due to take off yesterday , but the launch was scrubbed due to bad weather			2
on board the @entity116 is an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity108 astronaut @entity118 of @entity119			1
the @entity119 in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee - drinking in space			2
@entity0 , meanwhile , hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first - stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off @entity25 's northeastern coast , near @entity128			1
the booster managed to land on the barge but @entity26 said that ' excess lateral velocity ' caused it to tip over @entity26 tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to @entity134			1
@entity26 had put 50 - 50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity143 ' in the @entity5 @entity26 's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world , to reduce launch costs			2
first - stage boosters normally just slam into the @entity5 and sink			0
the booster was programmed , following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff , to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed ' just read the @entity143			0
' @entity153 — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around may 21			0
during a previous landing attempt in january , the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins , causing it to crash into the platform			0
a second attempt in february was called off because of high seas , but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart			0
at liftoff time , the orbiting lab was soaring over @entity168			0
the delivery of food and equipment will arrive friday the launch sequence as it happened			1
all stages of the launch went to plan , except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket			0
@entity0 once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand @entity26 recently unveiled the images of the @entity9 failed second landing after persuasion on @entity186 by the game pioneer behind @entity188 , @entity189			1
the @entity191 machine uses a normal @entity193 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			0
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			0
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
the images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month 's attempt			2
after it fails to reduce its speed , the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding			0
@entity215 described the event simply as a ' rapid unscheduled disassembly '			0
this is the @entity220 - based @entity0 company 's seventh station supply run since 2012 , all from @entity24			2
@entity0 is one of two companies hired by @entity223 to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles			1
as well as a recently extended 15 - flight , $ 2 billion contract with @entity223 , @entity0 is working on a passenger version of the @entity116 and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit			2
the company also is working on a heavy - lift version of the @entity9 rocket , which uses 27 engines , compared to the nine currently flying			2
the @entity238 is expected to make its first test flight late this year			0
while the booster landing did n't go to plane , the launch was successful			0
it took place at 4.10 et from @entity25 under perfect conditions , after a attempt had to be scrubbed on monday due to lightning on board the @entity116 is an experimental espresso machine intended for @entity108 astronaut @entity118 of @entity119			1

@entity0 made its third attempt to land a booster on a barge yesterday
but the booster tipped over after hitting its target and was destroyed
@entity9 is on its way to the @entity108 with supplies and will arrive friday
cargo includes first espresso machine designed for use in space
