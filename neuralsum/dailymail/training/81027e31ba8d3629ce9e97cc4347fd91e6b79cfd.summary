by @entity0 for the @entity1 given the sense of crisis once again engulfing @entity5 , it could be tempting to view this on - field revival as a template for how to cure their wider worries			1
if only things were that simple			2
a change of personnel and direction , enforced by some bold decision - making , dragged the @entity16 side away from a defeat that would have been deeply damaging even at this early stage of the season			2
how the @entity5 fans who witnessed it must wish the deepening financial concerns could be eased in a similarly swift and decisive way			1
they are well aware , however , that substituting investors and directors is nowhere near as easy as changing players on the pitch			2
leveller : @entity29 ( right ) celebrates brining @entity5 level protest : @entity5 fans chanted ' sack the board ' despite saturday 's win @entity36 ’s half - time introduction of @entity37 and , in particular , @entity34 transformed @entity5 ’ fortunes and enabled them to hit three second period goals without response			1
it was a victory that provided cheer on another day of discord			2
confirmation that the club is attempting to raise £ 4million from a share issue just to keep the lights on brought a new wave of anger towards those currently in power			2
a red card protest was staged in the @entity53 stand after 18 and 72 minutes , the first of those accompanied by a ‘ @entity59 ’ chant that gained echoes in other areas of the stadium			0
one protestor held up a banner stating ‘ no more faceless investors ’ just behind the directors ’ box			0
further ire was generated when the club declined to state the intentions of chief executive @entity68 over a contractual bonus worth up to £ 315,000			0
it was revealed in may that @entity68 could effectively double his salary in cash or shares by the end of august if certain performance requirements were met			0
a spokesperson confirmed @entity68 had not yet received a bonus but refused to comment further when asked to clarify if it could happen at a future date			0
it would surely be absurd if any bonuses were taken , given the perilous position @entity5 once again find themselves in			1
but if the past few years at @entity16 have taught us anything , it is that absurdity is no barrier to the possible becoming reality			0
off - field issues will dominate in the weeks ahead , yet that does not diminish the importance of events between the white lines			0
yesterday evening , @entity36 praised his players for maintaining focus amid the supporter protests and general air of turmoil that surrounds the club			0
more of the same will be required given the hugely impressive start @entity101 have made with four successive wins in the @entity104			1
promotion at the first attempt is a cornerstone of @entity5 ’ recovery , regardless of who is populating the boardroom , and it clearly is n’t going to be a straightforward task			1
back of the net : @entity113 enjoys scoring for @entity5 tricky encounter : @entity115 gives @entity116 the lead for a second time @entity119 came off the bench to net the clinching fourth goal for @entity36 ’s men at the weekend and carries the kind of experience that could prove vital over a tense campaign not short on distractions			1
the former @entity128 striker is adamant everyone in the @entity5 dressing room is braced for a lengthy scrap , but with full confidence of coming out on top			1
‘ we never thought it would be a gim me , ’ insisted @entity119			1
‘ we are favourites and i think rightly so			0
‘ i have always said that come may we will win the league			0
there is no doubt about it			0
‘ but @entity101 , @entity139 and this game against @entity116 have shown that no - one is going to make it easy for us			1
‘ we are not going to be handed it and we are going to have to earn it			0
we are going to have work and play better			0
‘ we are only four games in so you ca n’t narrow it down to ourselves and @entity101			1
i thought @entity139 were fantastic when they played us in the @entity149			0
‘ they will be there or thereabouts as well and i think @entity116 have started great			1
‘ yes , we beat them but i thought they can be proud about coming here and playing the way they played especially in that first half			0
‘ it is definitely not a gim me because it is going to be long and hard			0
but with the quality we have in that dressing room , we firmly believe that come may we will be at the top			0
’ to do so , @entity5 recognise they will have to improve upon the dismal quality of defending shown in the opening period			2
queens took the lead after 22 minutes when @entity169 galloped into space on the right and delivered a low cross for @entity173			2
he had the freedom required to take a touch before clipping a shot beyond @entity178			0
@entity5 levelled via a looping header from @entity29 – although visiting manager @entity180 felt goalkeeper @entity181 was fouled on the line by @entity113 – but were behind again after 36 minutes			1
@entity29 was woeful as he let @entity173 in behind him to square for @entity115			1
again , there was zero pressure on the finisher as he stuck the ball into the bottom corner			0
it prompted a double switch at the break , with @entity29 and the utterly ineffective @entity191 replaced by @entity37 and @entity34			1
close attentions : @entity5 ' @entity37 is bundled over by opponent @entity193 three points : @entity195 congratulates goalscorer @entity196 thanks : @entity5 pair @entity197 and @entity119 pay tribute to the @entity16 support the latter took barely a minute to justify his inclusion			1
capitalising on a slip from @entity203 , @entity34 cut inside along the edge of the area and dispatched a tremendous left - foot drive into the net			1
it was precisely what @entity5 needed to lift them from their torpor and a reminder of the talent @entity34 possesses			1
sadly for the former @entity101 winger , an ankle injury forced his replacement five minutes from the end			2
@entity218 then atoned for some of his earlier defending by meeting a @entity197 corner with a diving header that squirmed its way beyond @entity181 to put his side in front for the first time			0
@entity116 – missing seven players through injury - could n’t muster the same threat as in the opening period and @entity119 sealed the result within 60 seconds of replacing @entity34			1
latching onto a head flick from @entity195 , he scampered through to dink over @entity181 for the first competitive goal of his third stint at @entity5 .			2

@entity37 and @entity34 come off the bench to turn the game around for @entity5
but fresh financial *problems* have annoyed loyal fans
@entity5 second in the @entity104 behind leaders @entity101
goals from @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity244 and @entity119 enough for victory
@entity173 and @entity115 find the back of the net for @entity116
