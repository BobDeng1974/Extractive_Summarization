by @entity0 published : 17:37 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 02:15 est , 4 august 2013 a growing number of people are ignorant about the @entity3 and know little more about it than what ‘ baldrick ’ said in the tv comedy blackadder , a new report claims			1
one in ten think @entity9 was the leader of @entity10 when the war started and nearly one in 12 young adults thinks @entity13 and @entity10 were allies , not enemies			1
a similar number think @entity17 was the prime minister at the time , according to the report published on the eve of tomorrow ’s 99th anniversary of the start of the @entity3			1
primary source material ? @entity24 as @entity8 and @entity25 in the titular role in @entity27 , which is now where many @entity28 get their knowledge of the events of the @entity3 the @entity28 future think - tank report claims many @entity28 base their knowledge of the @entity3 on @entity27 , starring @entity24 as @entity8			1
the 430 @entity28 - born soldiers who were awarded the @entity34 during the @entity3 are to be specially honoured by the government for their bravery			1
individual sand - coloured paving stones , almost 2ft square , will be laid near war memorials in the villages and towns where the men were born			2
the government hopes they will inspire youngsters to learn of the deeds of their forebears			2
the report states : ' " i think it began when an archduke shot an ostrich because he was hungry , ’ ’ said @entity8 in @entity52			1
' that is now among the most significant sources of public knowledge ( or myths ) of the @entity3			1
’ @entity28 future director , @entity57 , said : ‘ most people do know that there was a war in 1914 and four out of five of us that @entity10 was an enemy			1
' but almost everything else is minority knowledge			2
‘ beyond images of mud , trenches and barbed wire ... the @entity3 is getting lost in the @entity69			1
’ by @entity70 , minister for faith and communities ' @entity72 , what did you do in the @entity3 ? ' the famous 1915 recruitment propaganda poster , aimed at coaxing fathers across @entity13 into joining up daddy , what did you do in the @entity3 ? so goes the famous 1915 recruitment poster , aimed at coaxing fathers across @entity13 into joining up and playing their part in the ‘ war to end all wars ’			1
one year before we mark the centenary of that conflict , which , of course , did n’t end all wars , we are starting to ask one another a similar question : what did your forefathers do in the @entity3 ? for me , the centenary offers an opportunity to address the historical blind spot we have when it comes to recognising the contribution of @entity97 soldiers			1
after all , think of the @entity3 and you think trenches and @entity100 , poems and poppies			1
you do n’t think of @entity104 landing on the scorching shores of @entity106			2
you do n’t think of men from the @entity108 travelling to @entity109			2
and you certainly do n’t think of sepoys in turbans , serving on the @entity112			2
but they deserve to be remembered			2
the largest volunteer army was the @entity115 , which provided 1.2million men to fight			0
this is a staggering contribution ; it ’s thought that a tenth of the @entity28 war effort came from @entity121 soldiers			0
despite the scale of sacrifice – 74,000 lost their lives in battle – knowledge of the contribution is sadly lacking			0
my mission is to make sure their bravery , and that of others , is not forgotten			0
immediately after the outbreak of war , divisions from @entity121 were dispatched to @entity138			0
thousands of men travelled across the world to fight for @entity141 and country – a king who was n’t from their land and a country which they ’d probably never seen			0
it was n’t just the propaganda that lured these men to battle			0
it was the glory that bravery would bestow on them , tribally and spiritually – and the 11 - @entity157 monthly salary			0
why is it so powerful to tell these stories ? when i visited the battlefields of @entity162 and @entity163 earlier this year , i found it incredibly powerful to see the graves of @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , jews , @entity170 , lying together , side by side , just as they had fought @entity173			0
scanning the countless names of the war memorials , and seeing the @entity176 and @entity177 listed on the @entity178 , is the most powerful reminder that this was a truly global war			0
i do n’t have any relatives who fought in that conflict			0
but both my maternal and paternal grandfathers fought in the @entity183			0
they were in the @entity184 serving , i believe , in @entity185 and @entity186			0
i feel a great sense of pride knowing that my grandparents were fighting for this country long before my parents even came to these shores			0
plenty of khans and @entity177 listed ... a pedestrian passes the @entity178 where the names are engraved of about 56,000 fallen soldiers of @entity13 and its @entity198 who died during the @entity3 i hope that uncovering the @entity97 contribution to the @entity3 will have a similar impact on other people			1
what better way of showing that people of all faiths and all backgrounds can unite in the name of freedom than by illustrating a shared history , one based on unity , freedom and comradeship ? this is particularly potent at a time when questions are regularly raised about loyalty and identity , about who genuinely belongs to this country and about our history			1
groups like @entity223 and the @entity224 argue you can not be @entity28 and @entity166			0
the story of the @entity166 soldiers during the @entity3 puts paid to this myth			1
it shows that just under 100 years ago we were n’t only rubbing along together , we were serving the @entity28 king together			0
i hope that , come 2018 , after four years commemorating this war , there will be many more people who know what their relatives did in the @entity3			1
and that many more will know just how many people – of all ethnicities , races and faiths – fought for the freedoms we @entity28 enjoy today .			2
