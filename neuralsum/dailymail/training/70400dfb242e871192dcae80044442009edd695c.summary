by @entity0 published : 22:15 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 15 may 2013 the @entity1 vote themselves both the most arrogant and the least arrogant @entity4 country @entity5 and @entity1 have finally found something they agree on – that the @entity1 are the most arrogant people in @entity4			1
that ’s the verdict of a sweeping new @entity11 survey about the attitudes of @entity4 countries towards each other			0
not surprisingly , many national stereotypes are reinforced in the poll			0
@entity5 not only find their neighbours across the channel the most arrogant , they also believe them to be the least trustworthy			1
in true contradictory fashion , the @entity1 vote themselves both the most arrogant and the least arrogant country in @entity4			1
the @entity22 are almost universally judged the most trustworthy , although eyebrows may be raised at the only dissenter , @entity25 , which saves that accolade for itself despite its financial meltdown			1
@entity5 , along with @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity30 and @entity31 , sees @entity22 as being the least compassionate			1
the @entity5 is seen in that less flattering light by the @entity1 and the @entity22			1
self - congratulation is common in the survey conducted among more than 7,600 people in eight @entity4 countries by the @entity38 - based @entity37			2
in fact , people of every nationality consider themselves to be the most compassionate people in @entity4			0
the @entity5 also consider themselves the least arrogant			1
notably , the @entity28 vote themselves as the least trustworthy people , but the most compassionate , which is exactly the opposite of the way they view the @entity22			1
cheers to that ! the @entity22 are almost universally judged the most trustworthy @entity48 did n’t exactly come out of the poll smelling of roses , scoring a 37 per cent approval rating among the @entity5 public			1
but he can take some comfort from the fact that he was second only to @entity22 ’s @entity54 in the chart showing how @entity4 nations rated their own leaders			2
as well as a 64 per cent positive rating in her own country , the @entity22 chancellor also earned a 73 per cent in @entity1 and 58 per cent in @entity5 for her handling of the @entity63 financial crisis			1
not surprisingly , the @entity25 gave her just 10 per cent			0
@entity48 scored a lowly 37 per cent approval rating among the @entity5 public and while the @entity5 public may have its qualms about the prime minister , 50 per cent in @entity1 think he ’s doing a decent job and 58 per cent of @entity31 are impressed			2
however , according to @entity37 , beyond that , mr. @entity48 ’s support is weak : just 25 per cent of the @entity22 and 17 per cent of the @entity25 give him a good grade			2
and in some countries , the prime minister ’s marks have declined since 2012 : by 14 points in his own country and by 9 points in @entity1			0
@entity1 president @entity79 fares even worse			0
just 33 per cent of his own people and 30 per cent of the @entity5 and the @entity25 say he is doing a good job			2
based on research in @entity5 , @entity1 , @entity22 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity25 , @entity31 and the @entity30 , the @entity11 research centre concludes that the @entity63 is ‘ the new sick man of @entity4			1
’ the proportion of @entity4 with a favourable view of the @entity63 has plunged from 60 per cent last year to 45 per cent now , says the poll			0
while the @entity5 may be considered the most @entity91 country , but its support for the union has barely changed in the past 12 months , slipping only two points to 43 per cent			2
britons quizzed in the poll are split evenly at 46 per cent on whether to pull out or stay in the @entity63			0
by contrast , @entity1 ’s backing for the union has plunged in 12 months from 60 per cent to 41 per cent			0
‘ the prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling @entity4 public opinion apart , separating the @entity1 from the @entity22 and the @entity22 from everyone else , ’ said the report			0
‘ the effort over the past half century to create a more united @entity4 is now the principal casualty of the euro crisis			0
the @entity4 project now stands in disrepute across much of @entity4 , ’ it adds .			0

@entity5 believes themselves to be least arrogant in survey
@entity22 almost universally judged to be most trustworthy
@entity28 vote themselves as least trustworthy - but most compassionate
