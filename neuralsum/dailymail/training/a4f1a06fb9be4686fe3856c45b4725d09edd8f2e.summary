by @entity1 reporter published : 08:29 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 10:49 est , 8 january 2014 a giant drone with the wingspan of a @entity6 757 commercial airliner is set to give the @entity7 the edge when it comes to spying			1
the @entity11 drone has completed its ninth flight trial to prove its ability to operate at a range of altitudes , speeds and weights			1
the drone could take to the skies in a few years and is designed to fly at high altitudes to provide surveillance and intelligence in realtime			2
a fleet of giant military drones called @entity26 ( pictured ) with a wingspan the size of a commercial airliner are set to take to the skies in just a few years after successful tests @entity11 boasts a wingspan of 130 feet and a collection of sensors , which gives its operators a 360 degree view that stretches for 2,000 nautical miles			1
it has been been developed by the @entity7 and @entity37 , which claims the drone will let reconnaissance specialists monitor targets from a greater height and at a further distance then other drones			2
the unmanned aircraft can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships			1
operators will be able to control the craft ’s radar and high - resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units			0
the company believes the drone could be used to support military missions on the ground around the clock in as early as 2017			2
the wing structure of the drone was put through structural strength tests in late august by engineers			0
they successfully demonstrated the wing is 22 per cent stronger than the @entity7 's requirement in their lab ( pictured ) should the drone drift from its programmed flight path because of turbulence , it can get back on course without intervention - a skill which it as demonstrated in a recent test flight			1
@entity11 has been tested in nine flights of over nine hours at altitudes of 50,000 feet in @entity78 , @entity79			1
the structural strength of its wings has also been tested in a vast lab as the craft will swoop from high altitudes to get a closer look at targets as part of its missions			0
‘ a team of engineers found that no failures or unacceptable deformations of the wing occurred when it was subjected to a load at 22 per cent above the @entity7 's requirement , ’ according to a company spokesman			2
the @entity11 drone has the wingspan of a @entity6 757 commercial airliner ( pictured ) and is set to give the @entity7 the edge when it comes to spying @entity104 , @entity105 programme director at @entity106 , said : ‘ during surveillance missions using @entity11 , @entity7 operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification			1
’ ‘ the wing ’s strength allows the aircraft to safely descend , sometimes through weather patterns , to complete this manoeuvre			0
’ the @entity7 has ordered 68 of the @entity11 drones and they are expected to take to the skies on real missions in 2017			1
the unmanned aircraft ( pictured on a test flight ) can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships			1
military operators will be able to control the craft 's radar and high - resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘ swarms ’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years , according to a new roadmap			0
unmanned aircraft carrying strong chemical weapons could also be on the horizon , the @entity141 @entity140 ( @entity142 ) revealed in its @entity146			0
current drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly , which is expensive and the @entity142 plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves , @entity147 reported			0
the roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘ swarms ’ of drone - bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘ mothership ’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into , guided by the bots ’ on - bard cameras			0
thanks to the unmanned mothership , the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles ( 463km ) the roadmap said			2
the weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans , as researchers are working on ‘ energetic nanoparticles ’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion			0
the technologies combined are intended to help the @entity141 military be ‘ more effective through greater automation and greater performance , ’ the report says .			0

@entity11 drone has completed its ninth flight trial at an altitude of 50,000 feet over @entity78 , @entity79
