a fanatical terrorist has escaped being thrown out of the @entity1 because it would breach his human rights			1
hate - filled @entity4 , graded the highest possible risk to the public , was released after serving just half of his nine - year sentence for helping the july 21 bombers			1
he now mingles freely among the @entity10 his co-plotters tried to kill six years ago			0
threat : @entity4 has been using public transport government officials are desperate to deport the @entity16 fundamentalist back to his native @entity17 but have been told they can not because he could face ‘ inhumane treatment or punishment ’			1
@entity4 was convicted of helping a gang of five @entity22 suicide bombers in their bid to repeat the carnage of the attacks of july 7 , 2005 , two weeks later			1
@entity26 , whose 22 - year - old son @entity27 was killed on july 7 , said he was ‘ filled with despair ’			2
he said : ‘ these people were plotting to commit mass murder - what about the human rights of victims and families ? ‘ these people had no consideration for the women and children they were trying to kill			2
how can they claim we should look after and support them ? ’ accomplice : @entity4 knew about the terrorist plot and failed to tell the authorities the case is the latest to highlight how human rights laws have left the authorities powerless to remove some terrorists and convicted criminals			1
imposed human rights laws have left the authorities powerless to remove some terrorists and convicted criminals			0
imposed by unaccountable @entity52 judges , they place the rights of the most dangerous wrongdoers above the risks faced by ordinary people			2
the five would - be suicide bombers were jailed for life after trying to detonate bombs at @entity64 ’s @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 stations and on a bus in @entity66			2
thwarted : terrorist @entity67 is chased by passengers at @entity69 after he had attempted to detonate a bomb during the failed attack on july 21 , 2005 @entity4 , 35 , knew about the potentially murderous july 21 conspiracy and helped the fanatics clear up their explosives factory			1
he was jailed for 12 years in february 2008 for aiding and abetting the @entity22 cell			0
judge @entity76 said he must have ‘ harboured the hope ’ the bombers would ‘ destroy society as we know it ’			0
the sentence was reduced to nine years on appeal and after time @entity4 spent in jail while awaiting trial was taken into account , he was automatically released on licence several weeks ago			1
he is now living at a bail hostel on a leafy residential street in north - west @entity90			2
he has been seen travelling on the @entity91 and catching buses			0
with music headphones plugged into his ears and a bag slung casually across his shoulder , he appeared to be caught on camera chatting on a mobile phone			0
it is understood that @entity4 is being monitored around the clock and must obey a curfew and other conditions , including a ban on using the internet			1
he is the second high - risk terrorist linked to the july 21 attacks to win the right to remain in the @entity1 on human rights grounds in recent weeks			1
still here : @entity110 also helped the july 21 plotters and has since escaped deportation @entity110 , 28 , who hid would - be bomber @entity113 for three days , escaped being deported to his native @entity114 after judges feared for his safety			1
@entity110 is also living at a bail hostel in @entity90 despite the protests of police and @entity121 officials			1
the release of @entity4 and @entity110 underlines the challenges faced by police , probation and @entity126			1
there are fears that they will be stretched to the limit as they try to monitor dozens of freed fanatics in the run - up to the @entity132 next year			2
research by one think - tank found that more than 230 people have been convicted of terrorist offences since 2001 , but only around 100 remain in prison			2
under @entity139 of both the @entity140 , and @entity142 ’s @entity141 , individuals are protected against torture , inhuman or degrading treatment			2
the clause allows foreign terror suspects to fight deportation on the grounds that they would be tortured in their home countries if returned			2
in february , @entity150 warned that @entity52 judges have turned @entity1 into a ‘ safe haven ’ for foreign terrorists			1
appalling legislation : @entity156 mp @entity155 says the law needs to be changed @entity156 mp @entity158 said : ‘ this is yet another example of how we have got to abolish this appalling human rights legislation that allows terrorists and violent criminals to waltz out of prison and stay in our country			0
‘ they should be deported instantly back to where they came from			0
’ solicitor @entity169 , who represents the families of several july 7 victims , said : ‘ there is no doubt it is uncomfortable for the families to see someone like this back on the streets after what feels like an extremely short period of time			0
’ a @entity182 spokesman said : ‘ we will do everything we can to remove this individual from the @entity1 and are extremely disappointed by the court ’s decision to grant bail , which we vigorously opposed			1
‘ in the meantime , we are working closely with public protection agencies to ensure that appropriate monitoring is in place			0
’ a @entity194 spokesman insisted that public protection remains ‘ top priority ’ and that serious offenders face ‘ strict ’ controls and conditions			0
analysis by @entity201 such is the perversity of human rights law that the worse the crime , the easier it is for the culprit to dodge deportation			0
this is particularly true when countries with a history of ill - treatment and torture , such as @entity17 and @entity114 , are involved			1
the @entity1 government will at least try to persuade the courts to send the convict back home			1
flashback : a @entity90 double - decker bus targeted by bombers during the 7/7 attack			0
a judge said the failed 21/7 bomb plot could have caused even more carnage but , when the foreign prisoner appeals , he will say that the gravity of his offence means he now has notoriety back home , and that he therefore will be a marked man to his homeland ’s security services			0
routinely , prisoners claim they will be met from the plane and immediately tortured			0
the @entity1 courts normally agree not to deport them – creating the bizarre situation where a terrorist or a killer has more chance of being allowed to stay in the @entity1 than a foreign shoplifter or a simple failed asylum seeker			1
@entity4 certainly falls into the category of being an evil man , given that he knew of the july 21 bomb plot , but did nothing to alert the authorities			1
chilling evidence : a handwritten note detailing the make - up of devices used during the 21/7 bomb attack found in @entity4 's flat he was brought up in the same foster family as july 21 conspirator @entity252 , and lived in the flat directly above @entity252 ’s eighth - floor bomb factory			1
he was also a close friend of ringleader @entity254 , who had a key to his flat and often stayed there			0
@entity4 housed the members of the plot when the fumes in @entity252 ’s bomb factory became overwhelming , and helped with the clear - up afterwards			1
at @entity4 ’s home , police found handwritten documents relating to the construction of the bombs ripped up in his waste paper bin			2
on one piece of paper were the words ‘ detonator , charge and @entity273 ’ in @entity270			0
the second man linked to july 21 who is using human rights law to dodge deportation , @entity110 , showed a similar hatred for the @entity1 public			1
the @entity114 provided a safe house for @entity64 ’s @entity61 bomber @entity113 before he fled the country on july 26 , 2005			0
he also acted as a ‘ runner ’ , retrieving a video camera and passport for @entity113			0
the camera was apparently used to record suicide messages			0
the judge who jailed five men convicted of helping the bombers , including @entity4 and @entity110 , said they had shown no remorse			2
@entity76 , @entity291 , said : ‘ you concealed your knowledge of the would - be bombers who were set to inflict even greater devastation than that of 7/7 which claimed the lives of 52 innocents			0
‘ you then helped them escape justice , leaving them free to strike again			0
’ it is a bitter irony that human rights judges have now decided that – regardless of the enormity of their crimes – they should be free to stay in @entity1 for good .			1

@entity17 - born @entity4 will not face deportation because judges rule he could face ' inhumane treatment '
the @entity121 is appealing the decision and *pledges* to try to have him removed from the @entity1
