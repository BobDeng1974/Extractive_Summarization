with his id in hand , the cherub - faced @entity0 will bid farewell to the amateur ranks at the 114th @entity6 at @entity7 this week and join the hard - nosed world of the professional game			1
no wonder they say looks can deceive			2
standing next to the defending champion @entity13 and the much - decorated @entity14 on thursday , it would be easy to think he is about to get eaten alive			1
but it ’s less than two months since the @entity17 teenager finished in the top 25 at a @entity19 event and that ’s more than @entity21 managed at the same age			2
at the season ’s first major , he sucked up a chastening double bogey at the first hole and missed out on the weekend at the masters by a single stroke			2
moving on up : @entity0 will compete as a professional at the @entity30 next week all smiles : @entity32 poses with his silver medal and @entity6 champion @entity14 at @entity35 last july it was after those events that @entity32 , 19 , came to his life - changing decision			1
‘ at the @entity41 on @entity42 i should have been at least six shots lower and that was down to experience , ’ he said			2
‘ i know every player thinks they should score better but everyone around me watching was thinking the same thing , that i really should have been a lot closer to the lead			0
’ six shots lower and @entity32 would have been joint second alongside @entity53			1
‘ that experience and the @entity27 told me what many of the pros had been telling me — that i was ready to join them , ’ he said			0
‘ until then i was n’t sure			0
but , without sounding big - headed , what ’s left for me to achieve in the amateur world ? my game is ready			1
i just need that experience			0
’ so to @entity7 and @entity32 knows the words that will greet him as he prepares to enter the locker room : ‘ @entity2 , please			1
’ it was that way at @entity66 at @entity35 last year when he won the silver medal for low amateur and has remained that way since			1
‘ i ’ve just got used to showing my @entity2 every time i turn up for a tournament , ’ he says , smiling			2
‘ you watch @entity76 ( @entity75 ) head towards the locker room and the other players and they have that presence and get waved through without any questions asked			0
but i definitely do n’t have that			0
’ he will acquire it quickly enough , of course , if all goes to plan following his professional debut at the @entity85 next week			2
staying grounded : @entity32 insists his the money and fame which comes with turning professional will not change him bright future : @entity32 shows off the @entity90 trophy after winning the 2013 @entity92 @entity91 not that his friends would ever allow him to get carried away			1
‘ they start yelling @entity97 ( becoming @entity98 ) if someone asks for an autograph , ’ he said			0
‘ how would i cope with fame ? i ’d definitely stay grounded with the mates i ’ve got , and my dad in particular			0
if you look at the likes of @entity106 , who is probably the nicest golfer i ’ve met at any level of the game and he ’s the world no 1 , it shows it can be done			0
’ @entity106 showed his class at @entity112 when he walked from the first green to the second tee with @entity32 after that ugly six for openers			1
‘ he was a big help and so were other players like @entity118 ( @entity119 ) and @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , ’ says @entity32			1
‘ i ’m excited about what lies ahead			0
it ’s my first proper job and it ’s a massive step up from babysitting my brother and getting £ 20 ! ’ @entity32 need only look over at one of his playing partners at @entity7 to know there are no guarantees			1
@entity131 , of course , went from finishing fourth at @entity66 as a 17 - year - old amateur to missing 21 halfway cuts in a row			1
all change : @entity32 's only previous job was as a babysitter for his younger brother ‘ i played a practice round with him at @entity112 and we talked about that , ’ said @entity32			1
‘ it just shows it ’s a big jump from the amateur game and the standard is dauntingly high			0
so my goal is just to try to make the cut in each event i ’m playing and take it from there			0
’ ‘ if i was n’t excited i should be thinking about another career			0
i want to play in majors and in front of big crowds			0
the @entity6 last year and the @entity27 were fantastic experiences and i think i showed i can play			2
’ making the cut and earning one final silver medal for low amateur would wrap up the first phase of his career nicely			0
then it ’s on to the real world , where @entity32 is ready to grow up quickly			1
even if he does look like he should still be babysitting .			2

@entity32 will turn professional after the @entity30
the 19 - year - old has never had a job , other than babysitting his brother
@entity32 won the @entity170 last year
