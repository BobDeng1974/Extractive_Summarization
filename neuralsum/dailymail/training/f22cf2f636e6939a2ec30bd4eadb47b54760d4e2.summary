by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:00 est , 14 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:21 est , 14 december 2013 reassured : @entity0 , who is 14 weeks pregnant , has a bipolar - type mental health condition it was the stuff of nightmares : a vulnerable , mentally ill woman held against her will and forced to give birth by caesarean			1
by her own horrifying account , her newborn daughter was snatched by ‘ social workers ’ from her breast and spirited away , to be adopted – the mother simply left to howl in anguish			1
hearing the case of @entity19 , who was in @entity20 to attend a training course and is now back in her native @entity22 , a senior @entity17 judge called it ‘ an extreme act of violence ’ , and akin to a horror movie			2
and , on first reading , it would seem there was some sinister agenda at play – a fragile mental health patient who had her unborn child stolen from her womb			1
for me , though , the case held particular terror			2
you see , like @entity19 , i suffer a bipolar - type mental illness			1
like her , i too made the decision – although with full consent of my doctor – to come off medication , to prevent any harm to my unborn child			1
but we now know @entity19 ’s experience is not as it first appeared			2
no one can doubt her anguish , yet the reality of the complex and very sad situation is not quite as she saw it			2
and knowing that there were professionals around to make decisions that could well have saved her and her child ’s life when she was unable to do so herself , reassures me			1
the caesarean birth was necessary because she ’d had one previously and a natural labour could have resulted in uterine rupture			2
it was eerie timing that , just a few days before @entity19 ’s story came to light , my colleague @entity67 wrote in these pages about how the medical establishment is geared up to support women with mental health problems who wish to start a family			1
@entity67 , who has a history of schizophrenia , is exploring her options and is n’t yet ready to start a family			2
my partner and i were not so well prepared when , in late september , i discovered i was five weeks pregnant			1
i had been told by gynaecologists while in my mid- 20s that i would have fertility problems as a result of polycystic ovary syndrome and fibroids			2
i ’m now 38 , and i did n’t think i ’d ever be a mum			2
after confirming the pregnancy with my gp , i made an appointment with my regular psychiatrist			2
he made me an immediate referral to see a perinatal specialist , a psychiatrist who supports expectant mothers with a mental health diagnosis during pregnancy , and for up to 12 months after birth			1
i made the decision almost immediately that i wanted to stop taking the four medications i use to control my condition , as there is a risk of damage to the foetus			0
initially , my doctors advised me not to – it ’s a case of weighing up the risks versus the benefits – but i was insistent			1
life - saving decision : @entity19 's caesarean birth was necessary because she ¿ d had one previously and a natural labour could have resulted in uterine rupture i take an antidepressant , which i had to be weaned off over two weeks as suddenly stopping can cause panic attacks			1
i was also referred for an early scan , at eight weeks , to check that the drugs had n’t already affected the baby ’s heart			0
thankfully , everything was fine			0
among the army of healthcare professionals assigned to me as a pregnant woman , i also have a mental health midwife			1
i ’ve not yet met her , but i am told they are specialists in the emotional side of pregnancy and motherhood			0
they all form my dedicated community mental health team ( @entity132 ) – every woman similar to me will have one – who communicate with each other about my case			1
bar a few mood swings in the first trimester that most pregnant women experience , i feel more stable now than i have in recent memory			1
maybe it ’s something to do with the healthy routine i have been sticking to , something i feel i need to , as it ’s not just me any more			0
i never used to eat breakfast , but now i ’m eating three times a day			0
by early evening i ’m exhausted , so i go to bed earlier and get up earlier , absorbing more daylight			0
i ’m taking recommended pregnancy supplements , working harder , making plans , and have a focus			0
but i am being monitored and have been advised that even though my partner is brilliantly supportive , i may need to spend some time in a mother and baby unit – like a nursing home but for new parents with diagnoses like mine – after the birth			0
a combination of lack of sleep and hormonal changes means there is a high risk that women with bipolar can suffer post-natal psychosis and a facility like this is equipped to support me , and nurse my baby , if that happens			0
my @entity132 have a duty to make a referral to child services around the time of birth			1
would they deem me unfit to be a mother ? but i was confusing child services with child protection , a different thing altogether			0
child services offers initial support , making sure you are coping with everything , if , and only if , needed			0
soon , at 32 weeks , a month and a half shy of my due date , there will be a meeting : a room filled with my @entity132 team , social services , my family , and partner			0
this is part of an ongoing dialogue			0
decisions are n’t made for me			1
just like any patient , ultimately what i do is down to me			0
but should i become ill , i might not cope so well , and in that case these people will act in my baby ’s and my own best interest			0
it would distress me to think that , having seen the outcome of @entity19 ’s ordeal , a pregnant woman would rather suffer in silence because she now feels that asking for help could result in having her child taken away			1
like her , in the past , i have voluntarily been admitted to hospital for treatment when i felt i needed help			0
but i would like to think this will be recognised not as weakness , but as making positive decisions regarding my health			1
episodes , as we call them , are only temporary			0
often there are many months , years or decades of wellness			0
unfortunately we tend to come under scrutiny only during the bad times			0
bipolar people are just like anyone else , and we can make darn good mothers , too			1

@entity0 suffers from a *bipilar* - type mental illness
she is pregnant and has come off medication for the duration
@entity0 is reassured she has doctors to help her make decisions
