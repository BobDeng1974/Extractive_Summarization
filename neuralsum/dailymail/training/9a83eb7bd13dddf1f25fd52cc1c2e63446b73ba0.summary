@entity0 are prepared to commit as much as £ 100million to their pursuit of @entity2 as the ailing @entity4 club try to beef up @entity6 ’s squad before the end of the summer transfer window			1
@entity0 manager @entity9 is desperate for world - class additions and has told executive vice-chairman @entity11 to do all he can to bring winger @entity2 to the club from @entity13			1
it is understood @entity0 have told the @entity15 that , with performance - based incentives , they will pay him around £ 200,000 a week			2
over a five - year deal that would take the club 's investment to £ 100m when a transfer fee of around £ 50m is included			1
@entity2 is aware of @entity0 ’s capacity to pay big wages and has told his family of his surprise that the @entity41 club ’s offer outstrips anything made by other suitors , including mega-rich @entity44			2
it remains to be seen if @entity0 can strike a deal with @entity13			0
@entity9 and @entity47 know they can not tempt @entity2 or any other targets with @entity51 football so financial offers have to be high			0
@entity9 knows he needs signings and wants to buy a central defender and a holding midfielder			0
serious : @entity6 ( right ) has told @entity11 to sign @entity2 before the transfer window shuts unimpressed : after @entity0 's home defeat to @entity58 , @entity9 is desperate to bring in some new players video @entity0 post-match reaction while saturday ’s dismal 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity58 came with a clutch of first - team players out injured , it still went a long way to place @entity0 ’s current predicament in context			1
the club have signed only two players — @entity70 and @entity71 — and done nothing in the market since june			0
@entity0 are also interested in @entity75 ’s @entity74 , and were getting close to signing defender @entity76 from @entity77 on sunday night			2
the @entity79 club want to take @entity80 on loan in return , although he is reluctant to agree			0
@entity75 boss @entity83 , meanwhile , has offered @entity0 some hope by suggesting the @entity86 club would be open to an offer for the versatile blind , a member of @entity9 ’s @entity91 squad at the @entity92			0
additional targets : @entity0 are also hoping to bring in @entity75 's @entity74 ( left ) and @entity76 of @entity77			1

@entity0 are willing to spend up to £ 100m to bring @entity2 to @entity28
the £ 100m would cover both the @entity13 winger 's £ 50m transfer fee and his wages at @entity0
it is *expected* that @entity0 would pay him about £ 200,000 a week
@entity0 boss @entity6 has told chief executive @entity11 to sign @entity2 before the transfer window shuts
the home defeat by @entity58 has only made @entity9 more determined to bring new players in
