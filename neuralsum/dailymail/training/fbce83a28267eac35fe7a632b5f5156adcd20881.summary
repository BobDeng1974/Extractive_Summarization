by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity3 republicans on @entity5 announced wednesday evening that just 67 per cent of @entity2 who bought @entity6 plans through the federal government 's health insurance marketplace have sealed the deal by actually paying for their policies			1
@entity13 members of the @entity14 said they went to ' all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace ' for the data after the @entity18 repeatedly insisted it did n't have numbers to share			1
the startling results will reignite the protracted political fight over the @entity6 that has dogged the @entity23 administration since shortly after the president took office			1
not so fast , mr. president : @entity23 announced on april 17 that 8 million @entity2 had chosen health insurance plans through his ' federally facilitated marketplace , ' but only 2/3 thirds of them appear to have paid their bills with one - third of enrollees yet to pay premiums , @entity6 's delicate financial balance between healthy young @entity2 and sicker retirees is very much an unsettled question committee staff released state - by - state numbers for the 36 states that participated in the federal government 's on - again , off - again online insurance exchange			1
as of april 15 , 88 per cent of new @entity6 customers in @entity46 and 87 per cent in @entity47 had paid up ; on the other end of the scale , only 42 per cent in @entity41 and 48 per cent in @entity42 could say the same			1
the other states in the survey fell somewhere in between			0
fourteen states and the @entity51 ran their own online marketplaces ; the @entity5 @entity53 did n't poll insurers in any of them			1
' in a sad reversal away from its vows of transparency , the @entity23 administration , from inside the @entity59 on down , has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep basic details of the health law from the public , ' claimed @entity66 @entity65 rep. @entity65 , who chairs the @entity67			2
' tired of receiving incomplete pictures of enrollment in the health care law , we went right to the source and found that the administration 's recent declarations of success may be unfounded			0
' ' we need a complete picture of how this law is working , ' @entity65 said in a statement			0
' we will continue to strive for transparency and hold the administration accountable for this law ’s shortcomings and broken promises			0
' the @entity84 fired back hours later , however , saying the @entity13 ' homework was incomplete			0
' these claims are based on only about half of the approximately 300 issuers in the federally - facilitated marketplace , ' @entity84 spokesman @entity86 said in a statement wednesday night , ' and they do not match up with public comments from insurance companies themselves , most of which indicate that 80 to 90 percent of enrollees have paid their premium			2
' ' additionally , ' @entity99 said , ' given the significant surge in enrollments at the end of march , it stands to reason that not all enrollees would have paid by the date of this so - called report since many people ’s bills were not even due yet			2
' white press secretary @entity109 said on thursday that the report was a manifestation of @entity53 ' irritation that @entity6 was succeeding			1
he would not confirm that 80 percent or more of enrollees had followed through on paying their premiums			0
however , he said he was ' confident it ’s not going to be 67 percent			0
' ' we do n't have hard , concrete numbers , but we dispute their numbers , ' @entity109 said			1
the @entity120 refused to share even partial figures with reporters because he said he did not want to give out unreliable information			0
@entity53 said they would revisit the totals in mid-may to see if the percentages improve			0
' we do n't have hard , concrete numbers , but we dispute their numbers , ' @entity18 press secretary @entity109 told reporters on thursday @entity128 chairman @entity65 , a @entity66 @entity13 , released the report that indicated the @entity18 's @entity6 enrollment numbers may be significantly inflated it 's unclear why @entity53 announced totals from what they said were ' all 160 insurance providers ' that issue policies through healthcare.gov while the @entity23 administration claimed there were 300 such companies			1
the administration 's number first surfaced during an october 24 , 2013 congressional hearing , chaired by @entity65			0
@entity143 , the senior vice president of @entity144 – the company seen as most responsible for @entity136 's early - day tech disasters – said then that ' more than 300 insurers , with more than 4,500 insurance plans ' were participating			1
advocacy organizations across the @entity2 ran a full - court press for six months in an attempt to enroll @entity2 , but they emphasized paying premiums far less the administration has not , however , suggested that surveying 160 insurers would provide an inaccurate estimate for all 300			2
@entity156 , a @entity157 congressman who is the @entity158 ' ranking member on the subcommittee , called wednesday 's report ' rubbish			0
' @entity18 majority leader @entity162 , a calculating @entity163 @entity13 , emphasized that his party 's data ' stand in stark contrast to the @entity18 's previous assertions			2
' ' while the administration was eager to declare that @entity6 's mandate had worked , it has so far not provided any substantive data to back that up			0
if president @entity23 disputes the information provided by the insurance companies , he should direct @entity177 to immediately release complete enrollment data , including how many people were previously insured			1
' the number has become a sticking point in @entity51 , with most estimates painting a dim picture of the law 's overall success in its quest to add tens of millions to the ranks of the insured			0
@entity188 surveyed @entity2 and found that only 27 percent who bought new health insurance in february lacked insurance before			0
that number had been just 11 per cent in january			0
@entity192 has projected that barely 1 million of the 8 million @entity6 enrollees to date will gain insurance they did n't previously have			1
a report from the @entity196 puts that number at 25 per cent of the overall total			2
but the interim picture includes a sobering look at how many young people signed up – and paid – for @entity6 plans during the six - month open enrollment period that ended march 31			1
just 25 per cent , according to the insurance companies , were between age 18 and age 35			1
the @entity23 administration said in mid-april that it believed 28 percent of new policyholders were in that age group			2
but some industry insiders have held out hope that the number would top 40 per cent			0
' in an ideal world , you ’d want to get as close to that as possible , ' @entity213 senior vice president @entity212 told the @entity217 after @entity23 took his very public april 17 victory lap. the @entity6 's financial model requires a large contingent of young , healthy @entity2 to buy insurance , with their premiums covering the spiraling costs of treating the old and sick .			1

president @entity23 *triumphantly* announced april 17 that 8 million @entity2 had enrolled
but as of april 15 , insurers who offered @entity136 plans told *lawmakers* that *33* per cent of their new customers have n't paid up
@entity13 members of a @entity18 subcommittee got hard numbers after the @entity18 said it did n't have any
the @entity177 *quickly* insisted that @entity53 do n't have the whole story
the @entity18 claimed the report was a manifestation of @entity53 ' irritation that @entity6 is succeeding
it disputed @entity53 ' numbers , but said it has no ' concrete ' numbers of its own
just 25 per cent of paid enrollees are age 18 - 35 , the group whose financial participation is vital to avoid a system - wide @entity6 collapse
