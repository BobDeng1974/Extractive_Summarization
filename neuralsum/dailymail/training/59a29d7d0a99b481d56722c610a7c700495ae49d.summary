by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 4 october 2012 critically ill babies could be diagnosed with genetic diseases in just days rather than weeks , thanks to a new rapid gene unravelling machine			1
doctors at @entity7 in @entity8 sequenced the entire genetic code of four gravely ill newborns and identified genetic diseases in three of them in just 50 hours			1
this was quick enough to help them make vital treatment decisions			0
genetic sequencing involves analysing 3.2 billion chemical ' bases ' or ' letters ' that make up the human genetic code			1
four gravely ill newborns had their entire genetic code sequenced in 50 hours at @entity7 in @entity8 50 hours to diagnosis : how the process works it can reveal dna variations that point to around 3,500 rare diseases			1
many of these conditions are fatal but around 500 have treatments available			0
up til now the process was viewed by medics as too slow and expensive to pursue			0
study author , dr @entity30 : ' it is now feasible to decode an entire genome and provide interim results back to the physician in two days			0
' the study tested two software programs developed at @entity7 that were used in conjunction with a high - speed gene sequencer from @entity39 called @entity40 2500 , which can sequence an entire genome in about 25 hours			1
the company helped pay for the study and company researchers took part in it			0
next - generation gene sequencing machines have driven down the cost of whole genome sequencing , but making practical use of the data has been more challenging , largely because of the time it takes to analyse all of the data			2
dr @entity30 led the study into the new ultra-fast genetic testing as many as a third of babies admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit in the @entity58 have some form of genetic disease			1
treatments are currently available for more than 500 diseases , but identifying them quickly has been a problem			2
typically , genetic testing on newborns using conventional methods takes four to six weeks , long enough that the infant has either died or been sent home			1
' up until now , they have really had to practice medicine blindfolded , ' dr @entity30 said			0
dr @entity73 , director of informatics at @entity7 , said the software programs help doctors identify which genes to test , and analyze the data quickly			1
one of these programs , called @entity80 , allows doctors to order this test based on the child 's symptoms , without having to know in advance which genes to test for			1
the software only maps genes associated with the child 's symptoms			0
@entity80 does this for nearly 600 diseases , but the team is expanding this to include all 3,500 known disease genes , @entity73 told the briefing			1
the team developed a second software program called @entity97 that helps determine which of the suspected genes was most likely to be the cause of the child 's illness			0
in the study , the team tested the system on four seriously ill babies whose conditions were suspected of having a genetic cause			2
one of the boys was found to have a heart defect that the team discovered is also shared by his six - year - old brother			0
the infant underwent heart surgery and has survived			0
while two of the other three babies were diagnosed with rare conditions they sadly all passed away			2
how the cost of decoding genomes has dramatically fallen since 2008 dr @entity122 , who helped interpret the study results said the study could give parents more information about the cause of their child 's illness and allow them to make decisions about what kinds of treatments they wanted to pursue			2
the test is projected to cost £ 8,300 ( $ 13,500 ) , but the team believes that may be worth it given the high cost of care in a neonatal intensive care unit , which runs roughly £ 5,000 ( $ 8,000 ) per night			1
the next move is to broaden the test to include 100 or more babies to determine the benefits , costs and potential problems linked with the testing			2
because the @entity39 machine was not available in the @entity58 , the team had to discount the time it took to ship the blood samples to @entity153 , where the actual sequencing was done			0
but @entity30 said the hospital expects to receive its own @entity40 machine next month			0
eventually , the hospital hopes to have its testing validated , so the researchers can do genetic testing on newborns in hospitals across the @entity58 .			1

doctors at @entity7 in @entity8 sequenced genetic code of four newborns
*super-quick* genetic test reveals dna variations that point to around 3,500 rare diseases
the test is projected to cost £ 8,300 . doctors pointed out that intensive care units can cost £ 5,000 a night to run
