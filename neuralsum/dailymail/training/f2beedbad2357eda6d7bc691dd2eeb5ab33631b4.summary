by @entity0 , arts correspondent eye shield : mrs @entity2 in dark lenses @entity2 insisted on wearing dark glasses on her first trip to @entity6 because she feared black activists would throw acid in her face			1
the prime minister believed her ‘ instinctively pro-white ’ stance had made her a hate figure across the continent and she insisted on donning the glasses as her plane prepared to land at the dead of night in the @entity18 capital of @entity19 in august in 1979			1
@entity20 the then foreign secretary reveals mrs @entity2 ’s fears for her personal safety in today ’s ( sunday ) edition of @entity26 ’s reunion programme which reunites figures who played a role in the ending of white rule in the former @entity33 colony of @entity34 and the establishment of an independent @entity36 in 1980			1
@entity20 who was aboard the same flight said : ' what was rather interesting			1
i do n’t think @entity2 had ever been to @entity6 before in her life			1
i do n’t think so			0
' he added : ' i remember as we approached @entity19 in the pitch dark she suddenly put on her dark glasses and i said to her ‘ what on earth are you doing putting your dark glasses are ? and she said : ‘ well i am so hated here			1
i am sure they are going to throw acid in my face			0
' @entity20 recalls trying to calm mrs @entity2 ’s nerves and how she was eventually ‘ overcome ’ by the warmth of the welcome she received			1
he said : ' i said to her no i do n’t think you understand the @entity6			2
i do n’t think they will do that at all			0
' i think they will probably cheer when you get in			0
when we arrived and touched down and there was a see of black faces all smiling she took her dark glasses off and she walked down the gangway of the airport as if they was no problem at all			2
she was so overcome with the welcome			2
' the early months of mrs @entity2 ’s premiership were dominated by the bloody struggle for independence in the former @entity33 colony of @entity34			1
@entity20 recalls how he and officials in the @entity79 tried to dissuaded mrs @entity2 from instinctively supporting the white regime of @entity81 who had previously declared unilateral independence for @entity34 in 1965			1
he said : ' my colleagues in the @entity79 and i did our very best			0
the thing about @entity2 was that she was instinctively in favour of the whites and @entity81 and instinctively against the @entity6			1
' but if you got in before the instincts had taken over the brain was very good and you had a chance of changing her mind			0
' mrs @entity2 ’s visit to the @entity18 was a public relations triumph and did much to heal the rift between her and other @entity6 leaders			1
the visit would lead to the establishment of all party talks at @entity100 in @entity101 which would lead to the establishment of @entity36			0
@entity20 , pictured here with the former prime minister , said mrs @entity2 was eventually ' overcome ' by the warmth of the welcome shown to her in @entity18 during the course of today ’s programme @entity20 refuses to comment on claims that the @entity33 security services bugged the hotel rooms of @entity6 delegates who were taking part in the talks			1
@entity20 also recalls his first meeting with @entity116 who would become prime minister in 1980 and who continues to control the country today			2
he said : ' a @entity122 @entity121 is a very unusual person			0
i found him a difficult man			0
' @entity20 said that @entity116 did not feel any bitterness towards @entity81 despite being held prisoner for more than eleven years			2
he told the foreign secretary : ' i do n’t feel bitter about people			1
i feel bitter about the system			0
' @entity20 said the fact that @entity116 had now become a brutal dictator should not detract from the success of the @entity134			2
he said : ' the result is one man one vote is n’t it			0
every party in @entity33 was agreed that there should be black majority rule and thats what has happened			0
' it was n’t a perfect agreement but it was an agreement which i think would have enabled @entity36 to become a very powerful country indeed had things had not gone wrong afterwards			0
' @entity148 programme is on @entity26 today ( sunday ) at 11.15 am .			0
