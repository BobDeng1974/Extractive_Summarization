@entity0 is used to wisecracks about his height			1
but when @entity5 ’s scattergun autobiography took aim and pulled the trigger , the @entity3 looked likely to become just another piece of collateral damage in @entity12 cricket ’s civil war			1
now , as he prepares for @entity14 ’s seven - match one - day series in @entity15 — a tour that will help the selectors finalise their plans for the @entity19 — @entity0 is in the mood to fire a few shots of his own			1
@entity5 ’s disregard for @entity0 ’s ability stems from his test debut against @entity26 at @entity27 in 2012			1
in the first innings , while @entity5 was crashing a sensational 149 , @entity0 made 34			1
@entity5 was critical of the way @entity0 batted against @entity26 at @entity27 in 2012 it was a quiet but crucial innings			1
@entity5 , though , had made up his mind			2
in @entity5 : the autobiography , he writes : ‘ his dad was a jockey and @entity0 is built for the same gig			1
we were facing the fiercest bowling attack in the world			2
i did n’t think he was up to it			0
’ @entity5 took his concerns to coach @entity42 , and — after @entity0 was out — told next batsman , @entity44 : ‘ listen , batting is easy			1
@entity0 was just making it look hard			2
the @entity46 were laughing at him			0
’ there is some dispute about whether @entity5 belittled @entity0 in the dressing room			1
but one thing is clear : a ringing endorsement it was not			0
in his autobiography , @entity5 ( right ) said that @entity0 was ' built for the same gig ' as his dad - a jockey @entity0 has only played two tests for @entity14 , both against @entity26 during the summer of 2012 @entity0 was dropped after making 10 and four in the next game at @entity59 and has not played @entity60 since			1
he said : ‘ plenty of people have slagged me off behind my back and he is just another one of them			0
it is plenty of years ago			0
‘ i have n’t spoken to him since and it does n’t really bother me			0
’ asked about their relationship now , @entity0 said with a smile : ‘ me and @entity5 are friends — we had a nice exchange on @entity75			1
’ what he may find genuinely amusing , however , was @entity5 ’s attempts to justify his contempt			2
‘ the poor guy has never been seen again , ’ writes @entity5			2
‘ so i was wrong about @entity0 , was i ? ’ @entity0 ’s performances for @entity81 in last season ’s 50 - over @entity82 suggest @entity5 might have crowed too early			1
@entity0 scored three hundreds and averaged 88 for @entity81 in the @entity86 last season @entity0 's only two one - day international appearances to date have both been against @entity88 in seven innings @entity0 crashed three hundreds , averaged 88 and had a strike - rate of 96			1
only @entity92 ’s talented wicketkeeper - batsman @entity91 hit more than his 15 sixes			2
and every time one of @entity81 ’s games was televised , @entity0 seemed to rise to the occasion			1
‘ as you have seen more over the last six months i can hit the ball as far as anybody and as cleanly as most , ’ said @entity0 , who was speaking to promote @entity82 ’s sponsorship of the @entity99 ’s @entity98			2
‘ in my eyes my height has never proved a problem			2
@entity106 ( @entity106 ) is not that tall ( he is also 5ft5in )			0
i can pack a good punch and i can perform in pressure situations			0
’ he might also have added that , at the age of just 24 , he has already made 12 list a centuries , from 97 innings			0
@entity5 has 15 from 233 , and averages 40 to @entity0 ’s 53			1
now he will have the chance to take his game to the next level			0
aside from those two tests against the world ’s best pace attack , @entity0 has played only two one - day internationals , both against @entity88			1
the experience has added to his drive			0
‘ i have been frustrated to say the least that i have n’t had a more consistent shot , ’ he said			0
@entity123 's little master @entity106 is widely regarded as the best batsman ever despite his height ‘ i did n’t get told an official reason			2
the only thing i got told was to go away and score more runs , which i consistently did in all three @entity129 can say they are mentally strong but i think that is one of my strengths			0
‘ i have been knocked down plenty of times and i will be knocked down plenty more			0
it is how you bounce back			0
‘ a big thing that spurs me on is proving people wrong			0
with my size i am going to have plenty of doubters			0
i have proved them wrong over the years and i will prove plenty more people wrong over the next few months and years			0
’ if the process begins in @entity15 , the selectors may just be able to pencil in a middle - order name for the @entity19 .			1
