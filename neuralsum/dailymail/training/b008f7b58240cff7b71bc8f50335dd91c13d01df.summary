it sounds like something out of @entity3 's @entity2 - how the hippo got 20 terrapins on its back			0
but this was a real - life sight for holidaymakers in @entity10 's @entity9 , who fell about laughing when they saw a fully - grown hippopotamus ferrying more than a dozen companions across a waterhole			1
hippos have been known to attack wildebeest , lions and even crocodiles , but this benign creature appeared to have a soft spot for terrapins and let a whole family sunbathe on its back			1
@entity23 , 42 , who captured the sight on camera , said : ' we could n't stop laughing at him			0
' i do n't know why he allowed so many to climb aboard , but we think that they were using him as a rock to sunbathe			0

*surreal* sight was spotted by amused holidaymaker @entity56 , 42 , who lives near city of @entity38
