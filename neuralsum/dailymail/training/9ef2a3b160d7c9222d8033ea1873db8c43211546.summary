by @entity0 and @entity1 they might appear to be a relatively modern phenomenon but ' mandals ' - or sandals for men - were also a hit with the @entity8			1
now a rare 19th century pair of mandals are to appear in a new exhibition celebrating the life and work of artist , @entity14			1
the sandals , which date from the 1880s , were a favourite choice of footwear for the artist , who is best known for his elaborate wallpaper designs , and , say curators , reflect his radical brand of left - wing politics			1
on trend : this pair of @entity28 sandals belonged to @entity29 who helped popularise them in the @entity31 speaking in an interview with the @entity34 cultural historian @entity33 told of his overwhelming belief that ' beauty was a basic human birthright '			2
as a result , despite his membership of the @entity39 , he was n't immune to the odd vanity project , including encasing his copy of @entity44 ' famous treatise , @entity43 , in gold			0
' only @entity14 would encase @entity44 in a gold - tooled binding , ' added @entity33			1
' it was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace			0
' despite his lofty ideals , much of @entity14 ' work ended up on the walls of the @entity28 elite , although his ' art for everyone ' philosophy made him enormously popular			1
and one of the ways he showed off his left - wing credentials was by adopting the mandal , an @entity67 fashion popularised in the @entity31 by @entity14 ' friend , philosopher @entity29			1
portrait of an artist : @entity14 ' radical politics have influenced intellectuals for generations family : @entity14 ( back row right ) with his friend sir @entity76 and their wives and children ' @entity29 was the man who introduced the sandal to left - wing circles , ’ reveals @entity33			1
‘ they became a kind of cult among left - leaning middle - class intellectuals			1
but the @entity87 exhibition , which opens on the 16th october , is n't only about @entity14 and his mandals			1
among the 140 artifacts starring in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of @entity14 ' wife @entity92 as well as some rather risqué gardening tools			2
one , the @entity95 roller created by sculptor @entity96 , features a relief of a couple entwined together in the throes of lust			0
other highlights include striking pieces by @entity103 and @entity104 , as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to @entity14 himself			2
@entity108 : @entity14 and his legacy , 1860 - 1960 , opens at the @entity87 on the 16th october and runs until the 11th january 2015			2
for more information , see npg.org.uk write caption here despite their popularity with modern lefties and the odd stylish yachtsman , the men 's sandal - or mandal - has a long and , at times , glorious history			2
the shoe of choice for nearly every ancient culture , among them the @entity123 , @entity124 and chilly - toed @entity125 , sandals were cheap and easy to make using anything from leather to tree bark			0
indeed , the world 's oldest mandals , thought to be 10,000 years old , are made of bark and were discovered in the @entity132 in @entity133 , which itself is believed to be well over 13,000 years old			0
the word sandal itself , however , did n't come into being for another 8,000 years and was coined by the ancient @entity123 , who called them ' sandalon '			0
@entity123 men could choose between baxeae , which were made from willow twigs , and the cothurnus , a calf - length boot sandal which was worn by @entity142 and politicians , and in an echo of former @entity146 president @entity145 , was often fitted with a thick cork sole to give the wearer extra height			0
later incarnations included the caligae , a @entity124 mandal used on marches , and the @entity154 , an @entity67 knob - fronted sandal that has neolithic antecedents but is still popular today			0
the @entity154 was also partially responsible for the mandals ' reintroduction into the @entity31 more than two millennia after @entity31 discovered how to make closed - toe boots			0
worn by @entity29 during a visit to @entity67 , the shoes proved so comfortable he set up a sandal - making workshop near @entity165 on his return home and in doing so , kickstarted a left - wing footwear trend that continues to this day			1
beautiful : @entity14 ' wife @entity170 , seen here in a @entity173 painting , was a @entity175 muse			0

mandals were reintroduced in the 1880s by philosopher @entity29
one early adopter was his friend @entity14 who popularised them
*quickly* proved enormously popular among left - wing intellectuals
19th century mandals appear in new @entity14 exhibition
*explores* the artist 's life and radical left - wing beliefs
