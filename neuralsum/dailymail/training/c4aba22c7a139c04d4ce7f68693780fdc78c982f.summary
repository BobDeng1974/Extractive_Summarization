tall , slender and beautiful , fashion models appear to have it all			1
but as these shocking images show , maintaining lovely looks can take a horrifying toll on health			0
and at the @entity8 at @entity9 , the scale of the problem became clear , as models strutted down the runway with just skimpy bikinis to spare their blushes			1
proving that thin does n't mean healthy , one model 's buttocks seemed to be lacking in muscle tone - which some industry insiders say could be the result of skipping workouts and staying slim by eating very little			1
less than toned : a model on the @entity22 catwalk during @entity9 was slender but lacked muscle tone in her buttocks and thighs ' it 's no secret that a bad diet , little rest , no exercise , caffeine and smoking is not good for our bodies , ' adds @entity34 , personal trainer and owner of @entity36 in @entity37			1
' the main cause of cellulite is simple : a bad diet of fatty foods married with long periods of not eating and dehydration or lack of water intake			1
' a lot of people also rely on other stimulants and sometimes even substitute food and water for these stimulants			0
this will also lead to diminished muscle tone and also promotes the development of cellulite			0
' in the case of these models , the stress of having to look their best , not eating to try and remain slim and working long hours with little or no rest , will result in cellulite build up as seen in these pictures			1
' due to the lack of nourishment caused by their bad diets and their intense schedules , their muscle mass is compromised as their bodies are starving most of the time , which results in flabby or flat muscles			2
' slender : the @entity22 show saw numerous very thin girls take to the catwalk the new pictures come in the wake of revelations that models stay ' @entity82 thin ' by eating tissues and outrage caused by @entity86 's use of what seemed to be a size zero model in its latest campaign			1
the tissue allegations appeared in the memoirs of veteran fashion journalist @entity92 , who was sacked from her role as editor of @entity96 @entity95 last may			2
according to @entity92 , she once spent three days on a shoot with a model but did n't see her eat a single meal			2
by the end of the trip , said @entity92 , the model was so exhausted and weak from lack of food , she could barely keep her eyes open			0
she also revealed that many starve themselves for days on end , endure regular stints on hospital drips and eat tissue paper in order to feel full			0
' you know how you read interviews where models insist that they eat a lot ? not true , ' added @entity92			0
' the only way they can get that thin is to stop eating			0
they eat tissue paper to stave off the hunger pangs â€“ literally ball it up and eat it			0
