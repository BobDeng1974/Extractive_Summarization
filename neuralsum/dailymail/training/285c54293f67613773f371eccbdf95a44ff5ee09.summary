by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 27 july 2012 updated : 07:49 est , 27 july 2012 the space agency @entity1 has put multi-billion observatories into orbit to study the stars - but its latest space telesope may be a little more budget - friendly			2
@entity1 scientist @entity7 and his team aim to build an x-ray telescope based on rolls of plastic tape - inspired , @entity7 says , by @entity13 tape			1
‘ i remember looking at a roll of scotch tape and thinking , ' was it possible to use the same design for capturing hard x-rays , ' said @entity7			1
‘ i talked with a few people , and to my surprise , they did n't see any principal reasons why it could n't be done			0
’ stuck together with @entity23 ? @entity7 claims that a telescope made of sticky tape could be a viable new way to look for @entity27 from the distant galaxy @entity7 and a team of x-ray optics experts at @entity1 's @entity31 in @entity32 , have begun investigating the feasibility of fashioning a low - cost mirror from plastic tape and tightly rolling it like the sticky adhesive commonly found in most homes and offices			1
‘ @entity7 's scotch tape idea is in an early stage , ’ @entity39 said			1
‘ in the next year , we will know whether it has a chance of working			0
’ if it does , it could prove ‘ game - changing for hard x-ray astronomy , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ it could significantly reduce the cost of building large mirrors , bringing within reach the possibility of building a mirror with 10 to 30 times greater effective area than current x-ray telescopes			1
’ with funding from @entity1 's @entity56 , the team now is pursuing @entity7 's ‘ early - stage ’ idea and has already begun testing candidate materials that could be fashioned into a rolled mirror capable of collecting x-rays — in itself a challenging proposition			2
to capture these ever - elusive photons , the mirrors must be curved and nested inside a cylindrical optical assembly			0
the rounded geometry allows the high - energy light to graze their surfaces , much like a stone skimming the surface of a pond			0
x-ray universe : over the past few decades , @entity1 has launched several x-ray observatories sensitive to lower - energy ¿ soft x-rays , ¿ including the @entity75 , which took this picture ¿ i remember looking at a roll of scotch tape and thinking , ' was it possible to use the same design for capturing hard x-rays , ' said @entity7 over the past few decades , @entity1 has launched several x-ray observatories sensitive to lower - energy ‘ soft x-rays , ’ including the @entity75			1
they discovered and imaged the faint , diffuse x-ray signal from a variety of astrophysical sources dominated by thermal emission , such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies			2
other missions , like @entity1 's @entity94 satellite , were sensitive to higher - energy gamma rays , but they lacked imaging capabilities			0
‘ there remains a large and totally unexplored discovery space of faint , diffuse nonthermal astrophysical objects emitting at high x-ray energies , ’ @entity7 said			2
one class of objects waiting to be better understood is cosmic rays — highly energetic subatomic particles generated in deep space — that reside in galaxy clusters and other large - scale structure in the universe			0
scientists believe that cosmic rays and the magnetic fields between galaxy clusters can alter the physics within galaxy clusters			0
a better understanding of these physics could reveal more about the birth and evolution of the cosmos , @entity7 said			0
to study cosmic rays , however , observatories would have to be tuned to hard x-rays			1
although @entity1 's recently launched @entity121 ( @entity121 ) and @entity123 's @entity122 , also known as @entity122 , are sensitive to hard x-rays , @entity7 said they only ‘ will graze the surface of this discovery space			1
’ because the signal is so faint , only an imaging x-ray telescope with a collecting area 30 times larger than that of @entity121 , working with current and future radio telescopes , could do the job , @entity7 said			1
‘ however , to our knowledge , nothing of the kind is planned or even proposed in the @entity137 or elsewhere because of the cost something like this presents , ’ he said			0
the only solution then is developing a new technology that would dramatically reduce the cost of building x-ray optics and increase the size of the light - collecting area			2
‘ if we can build a mirror that 's big enough , this might be the way to go , ’ he said .			0

new x-ray telescope built from rolls of plastic tape
design inspired by roll of @entity23
could offer new way to view ' hard x-rays '
