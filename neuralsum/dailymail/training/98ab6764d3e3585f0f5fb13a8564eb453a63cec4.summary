an expedition to a remote part of northern @entity2 has uncovered three new vertebrate species isolated for millions of years , with scientists today calling the area a ‘ lost world ’			1
@entity7 from @entity8 and a @entity10 film crew were dropped by helicopter onto the rugged @entity13 mountain range on the @entity14 earlier this year and were amazed at what they found			1
it included a bizarre looking leaf - tail gecko , a gold - coloured skink ( a type of lizard ) and a brown - spotted , yellow boulder - dwelling frog , none of them ever seen before			1
new species found : the bizarre looking leaf - tail gecko was among the vertebrate species which were found by @entity7 and a @entity10 film crew @entity7 , a tropical biologist from the @entity31 - based university , said : ‘ the top of @entity13 is a lost world			1
‘ finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime			0
i 'm still amazed and buzzing from it			0
‘ finding three new , obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like @entity39 , let alone in @entity2 , a country we think we 've explored pretty well			2
’ the virtually impassable mountain range is home to millions of black granite boulders the size of cars and houses piled hundreds of metres high , eroded in places after being thrust up through the earth millions of years ago			2
in isolation : the species , including the brown - spotted yellow boulder - dwelling frog , have been isolated for millions of years in the rugged @entity13 mountain range on the @entity14 in @entity2 a ' lost world ' : @entity7 said it was ' the discovery of a lifetime ' in the area which is largely unexplored because of a virtually impassable mountain range			1
pictured is the gold - coloured skink while surveys had previously been conducted in the boulder - fields around the base of @entity13 , a plateau of boulder - strewn rainforest on top , identified by satellite imagery , had remained largely unexplored , fortressed by massive boulder walls			1
within days of arriving , the team had discovered the three new species as well as a host of other interesting finds that @entity72 said may also be new to science			2
the highlight was the leaf - tailed gecko , a ‘ primitive - looking ’ 7.9 inch - long creature that is an ancient relic from a time when rainforest was more widespread in @entity2			1
the @entity79 , has huge eyes and a long , slender body , is highly distinct from its relatives and has been named @entity79			0
@entity7 said the findings detailed in the latest edition of the international journal @entity86			0
he said : ‘ the second i saw the gecko i knew it was a new species			2
everything about it was obviously distinct			0
’ ancient relic : the gecko is a ' primitive - looking ' creature which originates from a time when rainforest was more widespread in @entity2 back for more : the @entity10 film crew intend to return to the area to search for more new species including snails , spiders and even small mammals highly camouflaged , the geckos sit motionless , head - down , waiting to ambush passing insects and spiders			1
the @entity107 is also restricted to moist rocky rainforest on the plateau and is highly distinct from its relatives , which are found in rainforests to the south			0
virtually impassable : the @entity13 mountain range on the @entity14 ( pictured ) features boulders the size of cars and houses also discovered was a small boulder - dwelling frog , the @entity120 , which during the dry season lives deep in the labyrinth of the boulder - field where conditions are cool and moist , allowing female frogs to lay their eggs in wet cracks in the rocks			1
in the absence of water , the tadpole develops within the egg and a fully formed frog hatches out			0
once the summer wet season begins the frogs emerge on the surface of the rocks to feed and breed in the rain			0
@entity139 , a @entity10 photographer and @entity141 researcher who joined @entity7 on the expedition , said he was stunned to know such undiscovered places remained			2
he said : ‘ what 's really exciting about this expedition is that in a place like @entity2 , which people think is fairly well explored , there are still places like @entity13 where there are all these species to discover			2
‘ there 's still a big world out there to explore			0
’ according to @entity10 , the team plans to return to @entity13 within months to search for more new species , including snails , spiders , and perhaps even small mammals			1
@entity7 said : ‘ all the animals from @entity13 are incredible just for their ability to persist for millions of years in the same area and not go extinct			0
it 's just mind - blowing			0

a leaf - tailed gecko , a gold - coloured skink and a yellow boulder - dwelling frog were discovered
the rugged , isolated mountain range in @entity2 is largely unexplored
a researcher and @entity10 film crew made the discoveries
the crew plan to return to the boulder field in search of more species
