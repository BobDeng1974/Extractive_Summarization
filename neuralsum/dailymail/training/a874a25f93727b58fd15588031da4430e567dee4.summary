the @entity0 has approved a far - reaching immigration bill - after its chairman withdrew an amendment allowing gay couples to obtain green cards for spouses born outside the @entity7 the 13 - 5 vote clears the bill for a @entity0 debate expected to begin early next month			1
committee approval came after the panel 's chairman , @entity15 @entity14 sidestepped a showdown on the rights of gay spouses , caving to pressure from the @entity20 and others who feared such a vote could lead to the bill 's failure in the @entity0			1
@entity14 had been under pressure from gay rights groups to offer the amendment , which would have allowed gays to petition to bring their spouses to the @entity7 like straight @entity7 can			1
but the @entity20 and other @entity46 privately urged @entity14 to hold off as @entity26 supporters of the immigration bill threatened to withdraw their support over the issue			1
in a statement released on tuesday evening , president @entity51 said : ' i congratulate the @entity0 on completing its work on @entity55 , the @entity56			2
' thanks to the leadership of chairman @entity14 and a bipartisan group of eight senators , the legislation that passed the @entity0 with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform i have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system			1
' the controversy over the rights of gay spouses , with the ability to fracture a bipartisan coalition behind the legislation , has hovered in the background of the debate from the beginning			2
under pressure : @entity14 , pictured left with @entity79 @entity78 and @entity80 of @entity81 , sidestepped a showdown on the rights of gay spouses , caving to pressure from the @entity20 and fellow @entity46 solution ? an additional surge in immigrant traffic to the @entity7 has begun since immigration reform negotiations began as drafted by the @entity93 , four @entity26 and four @entity46 who negotiated the basic provisions of the legislation , gay spouses do not have the same right to a green card as heterosexual spouses			1
@entity15 @entity97 , a @entity93 member who does not have a seat on the judiciary committee , said : ' it would kill the bill			1
you 'd lose the evangelicals , you 'd lose the @entity105 , and the issue is wending its way through the courts			0
' and so for the amendment to be included is destructive to this carefully crafted compromise			0
" two people familiar with the deliberations said the @entity20 had suggested to @entity14 that it would be best to put the controversy aside until the bill goes before the full @entity0 , and congressional officials said similar pleas had come from @entity46 senators			1
all said they were not authorized to discuss the matter on the record and insisted on anonymity			0
@entity14 's comment to reporters was unlikely his final word on the issue , and hardly the first time he has demonstrated his independence on this and other bills			2
most recently , he was the sole opponent of an amendment that passed 17 - 1 on monday to make a third drunk driving conviction a deportable offense for immigrants in some instances			2
an april 10 rally in front of the @entity7 @entity136 brought tens of thousands of immigration advocates , and generated more subway traffic in @entity139 than on the day of president @entity51 's second inauguration still , a vote on the proposal could create political difficulty for @entity46 on the committee who support gay rights and are also members of the @entity93 , including @entity78 and sen. @entity148 of @entity149			1
@entity148 has told outside groups he will back the change if it is offered			0
@entity78 has n't said which way he would vote			0
all eight authors of the bill have pledged to maintain the essential outlines of the legislation			2
a vote to add the gay rights provision could lead to approval on a party - line vote in committee			0
on a final day of drafting , the panel also agreed to a last - minute compromise covering an increase in the visa program for high - tech workers			0
the landmark legislation creates new provisions to bring workers here legally and enforce against illegal immigration , as well as creating a path to citizenship for 11 million here illegally			0
@entity81 is the home of up a large number of illegal immigrants , including some who protested in front of the office of @entity81 @entity46 sen. @entity80 on april 10 , in an attempt to persuade her to support immigration reform legislation the measure also creates a new program for low - skilled foreign labor and would permit highly skilled workers into the country at far higher levels than is currently the case			1
at the same time , it requires the government take new steps to guard against future illegal immigration			0
as the day wore on , opponents of the bill made a final bid to strip the measure of its signature feature - a path to citizenship that could take 13 years and payment of fines totaling $ 2,000 to travel			0
@entity15 @entity204 ' proposal failed on a vote of 13 - 5			1
the rejection was one of numerous ways in which the bipartisan coalition behind the @entity20 - backed measure demonstrated its command of the proceedings			2
without so much as a roll call vote , the panel adopted a compromise setting the terms of the expansion of @entity219 high tech visas , a deal that brought @entity221 , @entity222 over to the ranks of supporters			0
under the deal , the number of highly skilled workers admitted to the country would rise from 65,000 annually to 110,000 , with the possibility of a further rise to 180,000 depending in part on unemployment levels .			0
