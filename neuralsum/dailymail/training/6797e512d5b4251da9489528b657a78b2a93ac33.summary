@entity0 was busy on the practice ground here at the @entity3 on wednesday trying out a putting tip given to him by @entity7 legend @entity6			1
the pair spoke on tuesday night after @entity6 spotted something while watching @entity0 throw away a golden opportunity to win the @entity11 last week			1
‘ i really appreciate someone with the stature of @entity6 taking the time to try and help me , it is very good of him , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 says he has spoken to @entity7 golfing hero @entity6 about his putting game ‘ whether he ’s right or not , i ’ll let you know on sunday night			1
the problem i ’ve got is that i ’ve been working very hard on my putting recently , and it is a fine line of whether you mess and try something else			0
but i ’ve certainly taken on board what he said and i ’ll review the footage myself and work on the putting green and see whether he was right or wrong			0
’ in some ways the conclusion to that tournament in @entity29 summed up a disappointing year for @entity0			2
six shots ahead at one stage , he had a 6ft putt on the home green to force a play - off with @entity37 @entity36 but , wholly uncharacteristically , missed it			0
on the positive side , it was his second high finish in a row at the end of a season featuring precious few such highlights			0
he can also take encouragement from a late - season change of equipment manufacturer from @entity47 to @entity49 clubs that has clearly gone off without a hitch			2
now , in his own words , he is ‘ desperate to salvage something from 2014 ’ with a win in this big bucks season finale			0
‘ i ’ve had some good finishes here and it is a course that i really like , ’ said @entity0 , who lost a play - off to @entity56 here in 2010 and was pipped by another @entity58 , @entity59 , last year			1
@entity6 gave @entity0 advice on tuesday night ahead of the season - ending @entity3 @entity0 has @entity59 in his sights once more this year , albeit the stakes are much lower this time			1
twelve months ago , the race to @entity67 was at stake and the close friends had a good - natured bet which involved the loser serving drinks to the winner			2
this time the race to @entity67 has already been wrapped by @entity74 , leaving @entity0 to try to pip @entity59 for second place , and a tidy bonus of £ 512,000			1
‘ there ’s still a lot of money at stake , so it would certainly be nice to catch him ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but there ’s no bet this year			0
we ’re not going for the whole shooting match , are we ? that said , given the year i ’ve had , it would be nice to move up that board and finish second			0
two weeks ago i was 64th , so there ’s clearly the chance to salvage something from 2014			0
’ @entity0 finished runner - up at the @entity11 last week despite leading by six shots at one point			1

@entity0 finished second at the @entity11 last week
@entity6 spoke to @entity0 on tuesday night about his putting stroke
