but either way , one woman 's mission to track down a man she let get away , mostly thanks to the help of strangers			0
it all started on december 23 at a bar called @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
' @entity18 ' , who did not want to release her surname , was on a pre-christmas night out with some girlfriends when she met ' @entity21 ' , whose surname she did n't manage to catch			1
@entity17 woman ' @entity18 ' left ' @entity21 ' at a bar after an amazing time getting to know each other - so she set out to find the mystery man @entity18 met @entity21 at this bar , @entity15 in @entity16 , on december 23 , but ran off with some girlfriends without exchanging details the pair talked about everything - ' religion , faith , morality , culture and how do you define culture in society ' , according to @entity18			1
' definitely not the things you just randomly talk to someone about in bar ! ' she told @entity42 5			0
' it was an extensive conversation in the middle of a dj playing , a hundred people dancing all around us			0
' but @entity18 messed up			2
she ran off with her pals and never exchanged details with her potential soul mate			0
consumed with regret and uncertainty , @entity18 kicked into gear after @entity54 - she had to find @entity21 , whom she described as ' probably early to mid- 30s , white male with brown hair , beard , brown eyes , average build , slightly athletic '			1
she photocopied 75 signs appealing for ' @entity21 ( from the @entity15 ) '			1
call me ! : @entity18 said she posted up 60 photocopies of a sign she wrote appealing for @entity21 to get in touch @entity18 's @entity67 account @ @entity68 was quickly filled with messages from people wanting to know more about ' this @entity21 ' @entity18 also embarked on a few media interviews , hoping that it would help her in her quest to find @entity21 ' i made the wrong choice on dec. 23rd			1
call me ! @entity18 ' the signs read , along with her cell phone number			1
@entity18 stuck up 60 of them all over town , mostly down @entity79 , she said			2
the old - fashioned ' looking for love ' notes were coupled with a new - age approach - a @entity67 account called @ @entity84 and the hashtag # @entity86			0
she also conducted a few media interviews , in which she said she ' is n't crazy ' and just ' fun and unpredictable '			0
thanks to help from strangers who got involved with the search , @entity18 received numerous tips as to how to find @entity21 many tried to help @entity18 , calling it romantic and re-tweeting her posts			1
others said that @entity21 should consider legal action			0
then , about 2pm on january 2 , @entity18 tweeted that she had found @entity21			2
' ! i found @entity21 ! to respect @entity100 € ™ s privacy , i wonâ € ™ t be taking any more interviews			0
thank you everyone for the support in my quest to # @entity86 ! ! ! ' while many outlets , including @entity107 , have reached out to @entity18 to find the ending of her fairytale , she has since shut down her @entity67 accounts and switched the cell phone number on her signs to voice mail			2
the end ? @entity18 confirmed on @entity67 on january 2 that she had indeed found @entity21 , but refused to elaborate on the outcome of their meeting			2

' @entity18 ' met ' @entity21 ' at @entity119 in @entity16 , @entity17 , on december *26* , and they ' hit off ' , talking for hours
but she left with some girlfriends without exchanging details
filled with regret and wonder , after @entity54 she posted up signs appealing for @entity21 to call her , which soon *sparked* a social media *campaign*
she has now been *reunited* with her prince charming
