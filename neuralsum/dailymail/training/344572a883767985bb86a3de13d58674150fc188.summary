one of the largest asteroids in the solar system , @entity2 , has evidence of ' recent ' water flowing on it , according to @entity5			1
images taken by the @entity7 , currently on its way to the dwarf planet @entity10 , have revealed gulleys on the proto - planet that are just a few hundred million years old			1
it indicates objects such as smaller than planets are able to have liquids on their surface - and suggests water may exist in more places than we thought in the universe			1
@entity5 scientists in @entity22 have revealed images showing ' recent ' flowing water on the surface of @entity2			1
this image shows @entity27 on the large asteroid @entity2			1
on the right is an inset image showing an example of curved gullies , indicated by the short white arrows , and a fan - shaped deposit , indicated by long white arrows revealed by @entity5 scientists in @entity22 , the images were taken when @entity7 visited @entity2 from 2011 to 2013 before departing for @entity10			1
previously , asteroids like @entity2 had been thought to be completely dry and incapable of having water because of their lower temperature and low pressure			2
but gulleys found on the walls of one of the craters on @entity2 suggest that is anything but the case			2
according to the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , a planet is an object that independently orbits the sun , has enough mass to be nearly spherical and has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit			0
this last point is why @entity56 was demoted to dwarf planet status , which is defined as being an object similar to a planet , but it has not cleared its orbit			2
@entity56 orbits in the @entity61 at the edge of the solar system , where many other objects similar or bigger to it in size exist			0
one of those is @entity67 , which along with @entity56 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity10 make up the five dwarf planets in the solar system we know of to date			2
an asteroid , meanwhile , is a large chunk of rock that orbits the sun but is not massive enough to have formed into a spherical shape			0
some objects have a dual designation : @entity10 , for example , is sometimes referred to as both a dwarf planet and an asteroid , as it is part of the asteroid belt			1
@entity2 , sometimes referred to as a protoplanet , is the most massive asteroid in the solar system , if @entity10 is not counted , while another asteroid called @entity90 is thought to be very slightly bigger than @entity2 in size			1
' nobody expected to find evidence of water on @entity2			2
the surface is very cold and there is no atmosphere , so any water on the surface evaporates , ' said @entity100 , a postgraduate researcher at the @entity101 , @entity102 ( @entity101 )			0
' however , @entity2 is proving to be a very interesting and complex planetary body			0
' according to the scientists , the water appears to have flown down the gulleys a few hundred millions years ago , a short period of time compared to @entity2 's overall age of 4.6 billion years			1
the gullies left behind fan - shaped deposits after evaporation , seen in the image			0
they are fairly narrow , on average about 100 feet ( 30 metres ) wide			0
the average length of the gullies is a little over half a mile ( 900 meters )			0
@entity27 , with a width of 9 miles ( 15 kilometers ) , contains some of the best examples of the curved gullies and fan - shaped deposits			0
however , dr @entity124 noted that it was unlikely @entity2 had rivers like @entity127 , but rather localised areas of liquid			2
' we 're not suggesting that there was a river - like flow of water			0
we 're suggesting a process similar to debris flows , where a small amount of water mobilizes the sandy and rocky particles into a flow , ' she said			0
but they ruled out the chance that the gullies were formed simply by the movement of dry material , as they share characteristics with debris flows from liquids on @entity127 and @entity151			0
the images were taken when @entity7 visited @entity2 from 2011 to 2013 ( illustration shown )			1
@entity7 is now approaching the dwarf planet @entity10 , the largest object in the main asteroid belt between @entity151 and @entity157			1
it will be captured into orbit around @entity10 on 6 march 2015 this colourful composite image , revealed back in december 2013 , shows the flow of material inside and outside a crater called @entity164 on the giant asteroid @entity2			1
to the naked eye , these structures would not be seen			0
but here , they stand out in blue and red			0
the crater has a diameter of 2.7 miles ( 4.3 kilometers ) the leading theory to explain the source of the curved gullies is that @entity2 has small , localised patches of ice in its subsurface			2
no one knows the origin of this ice , but one possibility is that ice - rich bodies , such as comets , left part of their ice deep in the subsurface following impact			0
a later impact would form a crater and heat up some of the ice patches , releasing water onto the walls of the crater			2
laboratory experiments performed at @entity5 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity22 , indicate that there could be enough time for curved gullies to form on @entity2 before all of the water evaporated			1
' the sandy and rocky particles in the flow help to slow the rate of evaporation , ' ms @entity100 said			0
@entity2 , pictured , is the most massive asteroid in the solar system , if @entity10 is not counted , while another asteroid called @entity90 is thought to be very slightly bigger than @entity2 in size the study has broad implications for planetary science			1
' these results , and many others from the @entity7 , show that @entity2 is home to many processes that were previously thought to be exclusive to planets , ' said @entity101 's @entity219 , principal investigator for the @entity7			1
' we look forward to uncovering even more insights and mysteries when @entity7 studies @entity10			2
' @entity7 is currently in the spotlight because it is approaching the dwarf planet @entity10 , the largest object in the main asteroid belt between @entity151 and @entity157			1
it will be captured into orbit around @entity10 on 6 march 2015 , when it will hopefully reveal many interesting features on the surface .			0

@entity5 scientists in @entity22 have revealed images showing ' recent ' flowing water on the surface of @entity2
gulleys were seen down the walls of a crater on the large asteroid
they were created a few hundred millions years ago , a short period of time compared to @entity2 's overall age of 4.6 billion years
it suggests objects smaller than planets could have liquid water
images were taken by the @entity7 , which is currently on its way to the dwarf planet @entity10
