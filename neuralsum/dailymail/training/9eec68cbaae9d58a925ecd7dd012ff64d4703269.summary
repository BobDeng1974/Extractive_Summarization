challenge : @entity2 ceo @entity1 has vowed to read a book every two weeks as part of his personal challenge for 2015 @entity1 has made his next book club pick , a release he considers especially timely after the recent terrorist attacks in @entity9			1
the @entity2 ceo announced saturday he would take on @entity12 's ' @entity11 , ' a widely discussed and occasionally criticized 2011 book that contends violence has decreased in modern times and the world has become more humane			1
@entity1 posted the news on his @entity2 page and on a community page he set up for his club , a @entity20			1
' recent events might make it seem like violence and terrorism are more common than ever , so it 's worth understanding that all violence — even terrorism — is actually decreasing over time			1
if we understand how we are achieving this , we can continue our path towards peace , ' @entity1 wrote			1
' a few people i trust have told me this is the best book they 've ever read			2
' among the book 's admirers is @entity39 founder @entity38 , who has called it his ' favorite book of the last decade ' and ' a long but profound look at the reduction in violence and discrimination over time			1
' next : @entity1 has made his next book club pick , a release he considers especially timely after the recent terrorist attacks in @entity9 two weeks ago , @entity1 declared he would read a new book every other week in 2015 , and he invited his millions of @entity2 friends to join him and participate in an online discussion			1
his first choice , @entity53 's ' @entity52 , ' quickly became a best - seller on @entity56 and elsewhere			1
but only 162 comments appear for last week 's book club chat held on the community page , which has more than 260,000 likes			1
within hours of saturday 's announcement , ' @entity11 ' jumped from no. 6,521 on @entity56 to no. 501			1
@entity62 , 60 , is a leading psychologist , linguist and cognitive scientist who teaches at @entity65 and has written several popular books , two of which , ' @entity69 ' and ' @entity70 , ' were finalists for the @entity72			1
' @entity11 ' is indeed long , more than 800 pages , so @entity1 is already fine - tuning his promise for a book every two weeks			1
he wrote that he 'll need a month to finish ' @entity11 , ' but will recommend a shorter work in two weeks that can be read at the same time			1
@entity62 's book also continues @entity1 's apparent preference for nonfiction works , written by men			1
his @entity2 page lists 13 books recently read — 10 nonfiction and all by male authors			1
my challenge for 2015 is to read a new book every other week -- with an emphasis on learning about different cultures , beliefs , histories and technologies			2
thank you to all 50,000 of you in our community who gave me suggestions for different challenges			0
many of you proposed reading challenges			0
@entity100 suggested i read one book a month that another person chooses -- and got 1,900 likes on her suggestion			2
@entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and others suggested i read the @entity109			0
my friend and colleague @entity110 suggested i read and learn everything i can about a new country each week			0
i 'm excited for my reading challenge			0
i 've found reading books very intellectually fulfilling			0
books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today			0
i 'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books			0
if you want to follow along on my challenge and read the same books i do , i 've created a page , a @entity20 , where i 'll post what i 'm reading			0
please only participate in the discussions if you 've actually read the books and have relevant points to add			0
the group will be moderated to keep it focused			0
our first book of the year will be @entity52 by @entity53			1
it 's a book that explores how the world is shifting to give individual people more power that was traditionally only held by large governments , militaries and other organizations			2
the trend towards giving people more power is one i believe in deeply , and i 'm looking forward to reading this book and exploring this in more detail			2
i appreciated all of your other suggestions for possible challenges as well			0
many of you suggested i give money to help people in need -- and @entity156 and i fully intend to keep doing that through our philanthropic work			0
we 'll have more to discuss there soon			0
some of you suggested that i meet a new person every day			0
that was actually my challenge in 2013			2
others suggested i teach a class			0
i 've done that too , and i 'd love to do it again and get more involved in education in the coming year			2
thanks again for all of your suggestions , and i 'm looking forward to a year of books !			2
