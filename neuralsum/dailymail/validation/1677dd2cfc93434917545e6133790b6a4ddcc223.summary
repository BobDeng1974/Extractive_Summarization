@entity0 was ridiculed yesterday for his plan to pass a law guaranteeing that television debates will take place in the run - up to future elections			1
the @entity8 leader claimed the move would ensure ‘ once and for all , that these debates belong to the people ’			1
but the plan was criticised by all sides , with former @entity15 leader @entity14 asking whether @entity16 would be jailed at @entity17 for failing to take part			1
@entity0 was ridiculed yesterday for his plan to pass a law guaranteeing that television debates will take place in the run - up to future elections he told @entity22 : ‘ could you actually pass a law which says that somebody has to turn up at a tv debate ? ‘ what do you do when @entity16 does n’t turn up ? shall we stick him in the clink , do we put him in @entity17 ? ’ @entity8 ’s launch of the proposed law was designed to keep up pressure on mr @entity16 over his refusal to comply with broadcasters ’ plans for three tv debates during the election campaign			1
last week @entity38 said he would attend only one , before the start of the formal campaign at the end of march			0
this would avoid the debates dominating the entire campaign , something mr @entity16 has been warning about for several years			0
education secretary @entity47 said : ‘ frankly i think the broadcasters have made a real hash of this because the processes and discussions have been going on for months			0
’ she told @entity56 ’s @entity55 show : ‘ they invited this party and that party			0
the prime minister has made a very clear offer – get seven parties in the same place , have a 90 - minute debate before the campaign starts			0
the plan was criticised by all sides , with former @entity15 leader @entity14 asking whether @entity16 would be jailed at @entity17 for failing to take part ‘ otherwise , all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates			1
’ @entity8 said putting the debates on a statutory footing would prevent the recent rows about when they should take place and which parties would be involved			2
the system would work on similar lines to the current rules for planning the number , length and timing of party political broadcasts , @entity8 officials said			0
this means that parties would be consulted but not given the right to veto			0
the @entity89 would become a recognised legal body for deciding the debates ’ dates , format , volume and who was attending			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ in recent days the @entity97 public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the tv debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm			1
’ on @entity22 , mr @entity14 , right , asked : ‘ what do you do when @entity16 does n’t turn up ? shall we stick him in the clink , do we put him in @entity17 ? ’ he told the @entity107 that the broadcasters had ‘ made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the @entity97 public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods			1
it is time to ensure , once and for all , that these debates belong to the people , not the prime minister of the day			1
’ @entity8 said it would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place ahead of the proposed 2020 election			0
the party ’s deputy leader @entity127 told @entity129 that @entity8 would bring in a legal framework ‘ like there is for the party election broadcasts , like there is for the rules on election spending and the election campaign ’			2
she added that this would avoid ‘ the broadcasters working together on an ad - hoc basis and @entity16 just ducking and weaving ’ .			2
