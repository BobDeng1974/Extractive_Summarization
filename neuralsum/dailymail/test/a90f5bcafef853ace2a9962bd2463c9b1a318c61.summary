' but unless it was the right job i would not bother			2
it has got to be something which i really wanted to do			2
' it would not be a case of the money			0
i had an offer earlier this week to go and work abroad where the money was incredible , a mind - blowing offer , but at the moment it did not interest me			0

' i could even work with a younger coach to help them and they could then take over as manager in a year or two , to help build the club up ; that is something which would interest me but we will have to wait and see what comes along			2
