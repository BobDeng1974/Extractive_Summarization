by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 29 august 2013 the new @entity2 governor says he is ‘ personally ’ ready to head off the risks of a housing bubble caused by low interest rates and the government ’s help to buy scheme			1
in his first national newspaper interview since taking charge , @entity9 tells the @entity12 that he is alert to the ‘ damage ’ that could be caused by uncontrolled mortgage lending and surging house prices			1
the @entity16 , who was a postgraduate student at @entity18 , says : ‘ i lived in the country in the late ’ 80s , 1990s , i saw the boom - bust cycle in the housing sector , the damage it can do , the length of time it took to repair			2
i ’m very alert personally to this issue			0
’ new @entity2 governor @entity9 has said he is alert to the ' damage ' uncontrolled mortgage lending and surging house prices could cause mr @entity9 said the @entity2 now has a ' toolkit ' to restrict mortgage credit and even raise the amount of capital that banks and building societies must hold to restrain home loans his comments come against the background of sharply recovering house prices			1
they climbed 4.6 per cent in the three months to july , the highest annual rate for more than three years			0
‘ we are watching it closely and we will as appropriate make our views known in terms of the degree of this risk and the potential action that should be taken to address it , ’ he adds			0
mr @entity9 says this could involve using the new powers of the @entity2 ’s financial policy committee , which he chairs			1
in the past the @entity2 ’s response to a potential housing bubble would have been to raise interest rates			2
the governor says it now has a ‘ toolkit ’ to restrict mortgage credit and even raise the amount of capital that banks and building societies must hold to restrain home loans			1
‘ we have the responsibility to assess emerging vulnerabilities in the economy such as housing , make those assessments and recommend action , ’ he says			0
‘ interest rates are principally an instrument of monetary policy for achieving the inflation outcome and there are other tools that address risks			0
’ his comments come against a great deal of scepticism about the extension of @entity83 ’s help to buy scheme , which was unveiled in the @entity85			0
@entity9 's comments come against the background of sharply recovering house prices - they climbed 4.6 per cent in the three months to july , the highest annual rate for more than three years under that plan , designed to kick start house building , homebuyers will be able to access £ 135billion of mortgage subsidies from january 1 next year			1
mr @entity9 recognises that heading off a credit or housing bubble , of the kind seen in the run - up to the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis will be a ‘ challenging task ’			1
in what might be taken as a veiled warning to the chancellor , he says even with new tools ‘ it would be difficult to achieve if there were a host of government policies or other events that are pushing in the other direction ’			0
in a wide ranging interview the governor , described by mr @entity83 as ‘ the best central banker of his generation ’ , also puts some distance between the @entity2 and the government over the future of the @entity117			2
delays and reviews by successive governments mean that @entity117 is still 80 per cent government - owned and its future is uncertain with mps demanding a split between the ‘ good ’ lending side of the bank and its ‘ bad ’ largely investment banking arm			0
mr @entity9 also put some distance between the @entity2 and the government over the future of the @entity117 ‘ it is absolutely imperative that the uncertainty around @entity117 is dissipated , absolutely imperative , ’ he says			1
the bank chief says that if @entity140 ’s economic performance is to be improved ‘ there has to be an increase in bank lending to new business with good ideas or existing businesses that have a good expansion plan ’			0
that is why the @entity2 is seeking to free up £ 90billion in new lending by easing the requirements on the amounts of cash banks must hold			2
turning to savers , mr @entity9 says that keeping interest low and bringing unemployment down to 7 per cent by 2016 – the @entity2 ’s target – is important to them too , despite low returns			1
the sooner the economy is restored to growth and unemployment is brought down ‘ the sooner there is normalisation of interest rates and savers will earn a return , ’ he adds .			0
