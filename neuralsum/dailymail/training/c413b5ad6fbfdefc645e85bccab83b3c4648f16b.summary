the $ 3bn acquisition by far the most expensive in @entity1 's 38 - year history , and comes three weeks after the deal was first rumoured - although the initial price was believed to be $ 3.2bn			1
@entity1 boss @entity11 revealed the deal , saying ' we have known these guys forever , we 've dated , we 've gone steady and now we are getting married			1
it now dominates the luxury headphone market			0
its equipment also has been a big seller in @entity1 's stores			1
operating from its @entity33 , @entity34 , headquarters , @entity16 commands 62 percent of the $ 1 billion @entity36 market for headphones priced above $ 100 , according to @entity38			0
the gear , which emphasizes bass , also has been endorsed by several star athletes , including @entity43 49ers quarterback @entity42 and @entity44 forward @entity45			0
@entity46 , the music streaming subsidiary of the electronics maker , has more than 250,000 subscribers , according to @entity11			2
' i ’ve always known in my heart that @entity16 belonged with @entity1 , ' said @entity6			1
as part of the acquisition , @entity16 co-founders @entity6 and dr. @entity5 will join @entity1			1
' the idea when we started the company was inspired by @entity1 ’s unmatched ability to marry culture and technology			2
@entity1 ’s deep commitment to music fans , artists , songwriters and the music industry is something special			1
' the price consists of $ 2.6 billion in cash and $ 400 million in @entity1 stock that will vest over an unspecified time period			2
the deal is expected to close before the end of september			0
it is believed @entity1 is also interested in beats expertise in developing wearable products and it edges closer to a much anticipated @entity77 launch , with $ 1.1 billion in revenue last year , @entity16 is already making money and will boost @entity1 's earnings once the new fiscal year begins in october , @entity1 ceo @entity11 said in an interview			1
' this relationship started a decade ago , so we know there is an incredible cultural fit			0
' these two guys have a very rare set of skills			0
it 's like finding a particular grain of sand on the beach			0
' @entity6 , 61 , and @entity5 , 49 , will both become key executives in @entity1 's music divisions , though @entity11 said their roles have n't been determined yet			1
@entity11 said @entity16 ' music streaming service was the main selling point in the deal			1
beats headphones are sold along side ipods in an @entity103 - @entity1 plans to roll them out across the world the growing popularity of music streaming services such as @entity108 and @entity109 has been reducing sales of songs and albums , a business that @entity114 has dominated for the past decade			1
@entity36 sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $ 2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $ 1.4 billion , according to the @entity118			1
although @entity1 broke into streaming with the launch of @entity122 last september , the service has not been as popular or as lucrative as the company expected , according to two people familiar with the matter			1
the people were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity1 is counting on the @entity16 acquisition to boost its cachet with teenagers and younger adults while trying to remain a leader in digital music — an industry that looks much different than when @entity1 reshaped the scene with the 2001 debut of the @entity139			2
dr. @entity5 , who founded beats electronics with record producer music producer @entity6			1
the firm could now be sold to @entity1			2
the purchase marks @entity1 ceo @entity11 's biggest strategic break from the way the @entity20 , @entity34 , company was led under co-founder @entity146 , who died in october 2011			2
@entity146 favored smaller acquisitions and did n't believe subscription music plans would be popular			0
before beats , @entity1 's biggest acquisition had been its $ 400 million purchase of @entity152 , a company that @entity146 founded after being ousted from @entity1 in the 1980s			1
@entity11 said he never considered what @entity146 would have thought about the @entity16 ' acquisition			0
@entity146 ' told me to do what was right , ' @entity11 said			0
' and i am 100 percent certain this is what is right			0
' this is one of those things that we will look back upon and say it was meant to be			0
' @entity164 ceo @entity163 , who considers @entity6 to be his best friend , believes @entity11 is making a smart move that will give @entity1 even more credibility in the music industry			1
' it 's a game changer because @entity6 is that kind of guy who can change a game , ' @entity163 said			2
' i am not saying he is @entity146 , but he is a guy with new ideas and he really knows how to build the bridge between music and technology			0
' but some analysts question whether @entity16 will be a good fit for @entity1 , which makes most of its money selling hardware such as iphones and @entity182			0
beats has also partnered with a host of celebrities , including @entity186 , to create endorsed earphones			0
@entity189 analyst @entity188 says @entity1 would have been better off developing its own headphones in - house and expanding into music subscriptions through @entity114			2
' it 's hard to understand why @entity1 would have to spend $ 3 billion on a nascent streaming service and a line of bass - heavy headphones , ' @entity188 says			1
@entity197 , the author of ' @entity198 , ' an inside look at @entity1 since co-founder @entity146 ' death , also sees a disconnect			0
' culturally , @entity16 is the complete opposite of @entity1 , ' @entity203 says			0
' it 's known for being loud and bold and in your face			0
it does n't fit with @entity1 's understated , discerning brand			2
' the beats deal also aligns @entity1 with the push toward higher - quality music , reversing a decline in fidelity as people abandoned vinyl records for cds and then switched from cds to @entity217			1
the beats move follows a string of high - priced deals in @entity221 , after @entity222 acquired smart home developer @entity223 for $ 3.2bn and @entity225 offered an initial $ 19bn for @entity226 , and then bought @entity228 firm @entity227 for $ 2bn			0
