it 's a cold and windy tuesday in february and i 'm on my way to @entity3 , looking - in my head - pretty glamorous			1
and by glamorous , i mean that i have woken up half an hour earlier than i normally would , blow - dried , brushed and straightened my hair and i have a full face of make - up on			0
or at least i thought it was a full face of make up - until i arrived at @entity8 in @entity9 , the salon owned by @entity10 from the hit reality tv series , @entity12 of @entity3			1
in fact , the pretty beauticians , who are busying themselves applying polish at the nail station , look better than i do on most nights out and i wonder if i have time to sneak into the toilet and shove on another layer of lipstick			0
i 'm here to find out what it takes to look like the nation 's new favourite reality stars - the glamorous women of @entity3			1
the breakout star of the show is @entity10 , the tanned , big - haired straight - talking businesswoman who 's also the only divorcee of the programme			1
when i meet her in the flesh - all hair , legs and a pearly white smile to boot - she does n't disappoint and it takes no time at all to feel like i 'm in an episode of the @entity56 show			0
' just wait til we 're done with you , ' she beams , leading me in to a treatment room complete with faux fur blanket and offering me a glass of @entity62 , which i politely decline as it 's only 11.45 in the morning			2
facial time : @entity26 cleansed @entity14 's skin and removed her make - up before she started the procedure the first step in my @entity12 makeover is a @entity68 facial , which involves being prodded with what look like cattle prongs			1
thankfully , they do n't feel like them though and the beautician @entity26 explains that the probes , which feel like a firm massage , are lifting and re-shaping my face			0
i 'm pretty sceptical that it 's doing anything at all but when the right side is finished she hands me a mirror and i have to say the results are pretty impressive			2
the probes sent waves through @entity14 's face which are supposed to lift and tighten her muscles my face looks visibly lifted to the point that the left side now looks a little saggy in comparison , which , at 27 , is not something you want to see			1
the treatment , which is known as a non-surgical facelift , concludes with led light therapy which is supposed to iron out the lines on your forehead			0
i resist saying that until this makeover started , i did n't even think i had any			2
next up is the @entity100 facial , which starts with an orbital microdermabrasion head that exfoliates the outer layer of your skin			1
@entity14 , left , tries out the @entity12 ' beauty treatments while a fully made - up @entity10 looks on at the end of the @entity100 facial , @entity14 's beautician @entity27 sprayed a relaxing mist over her face this stings a bit but is soon cooled by a face mask			1
i ask @entity10 how often she would recommend having the treatments done and she replies : ' if i could i would have one about every couple of weeks			1
' it 's important to maintain your skin			2
our clients come in regularly and usually sign up for a course of ten treatments			0
' sounds like this real housewife malarkey is a lot of hard work			0
@entity27 , who does the treatment , explains that the results are supposed to be like having the @entity126 without having to pump your face full of chemicals			0
@entity10 and @entity14 have their nails done , @entity12 style - with a glass of @entity62 @entity10 helped @entity14 to pick a light , classic colour that would n't clash with her dress a second reveal shows my face is smooth and incredibly clean - looking and it does look tighter - there 's something to this ' notox , ' thing after all			1
the only downside is that with the top layer of my skin removed , the emergency fake tan i had applied the night before is clear to see in a ring around my neck			0
but it 's a small price to pay for crystal clear skin and they assure me this can be covered with make - up later on			2
next up came the task of picking a nail varnish to match my @entity156 makeover dress - fresh from @entity10 's own wardrobe with the tags still on			1
' i think you should go with a light colour , something classic , ' says @entity10 , who has owned the salon in the the leafy @entity3 suburb for the last year			1
time for a wash : @entity165 washed @entity14 's hair before getting to work on drying it and putting it into an extravagant up - do @entity169 gave @entity14 a similar look to @entity10 's , recreating the @entity3 businesswoman 's favourite smoky eye make - up complete : when the make - up was done you could no longer tell @entity14 had a fake - tan error as i settle down at the nail bar , she brings me a glass of fizz and i begin to think i could get used to this @entity12 lifestyle			1
on the @entity56 show , @entity10 and her fellow housewives @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 certainly do appear to live the high life			1
the women fill their weeks with @entity62 brunches , charity galas and plenty of gossip			0
but there are some downsides , or at least ' odd ' sides to starring in a successful television show			0
during my time at the salon , @entity10 is bombarded with phone calls from a man pretending to be her ex-husband , @entity200			1
while it seems he 's just a harmless fan , it must be a bit disconcerting for her and her staff			0
from @entity205 girl to @entity3 housewife : @entity14 is given @entity10 's make - up and now her dress i ask her if it 's been odd adjusting to life on the small screen			1
she says : ' it is very surreal , but mostly people are nice and i 've had a lot of support			0
' on the show , @entity10 comes across as the tough one of the group but in real life she definitely has a softer side			2
she also has a strong work ethic that does n't come across on the programme - she 's very hands - on with the salon where she works seven days a week			2
after my nails are finished , we head upstairs and she lends me her own make - up artist , @entity227 , to begin the final steps of my transformation			0
' i always like to have a glamorous eye , ' she advises , so i opt for the same			0
great host : @entity10 made sure to make her new lookalike @entity14 feel welcome at her opium salon at the front desk : @entity10 works in the salon seven days a week and is very hands - on with the business it feels strange to be wearing so much make - up in the middle of the day but i must say the results are amazing			1
my skin looks flawless and i have contouring that even @entity243 would be envious of			0
with my make - over nearly complete , @entity8 's hair - stylist @entity244 teases my hair into a giant bouffant do and it 's time to slip on my dress			0
@entity10 too slips into a new outfit - a breast - baring , leg - showing , showstopper of a gown that would n't put her out of place on @entity256			2
as she 's slipping into her costume , she says : ' when i 'm in @entity205 i like to shop at @entity258 's and @entity259 but i buy a lot of my clothes abroad as well as i hate to wear the same things as everyone else			0
' as the day draws to a close and i wave goodbye to @entity10 and the other salon staff , i ca n't help but feel a little sad to be leaving @entity3			1
i 'd certainly like to keep my @entity12 look , if only i had my own hair - stylist and make - up artist ...			2
