the killing in the port city of @entity20 drew national attention , and the trial was moved to the @entity69 suburb of @entity70 owing to extensive publicity locally			0
prosecutors have said information from @entity12 ' mother and sister led investigators to a pond where they found the revolver			1
@entity12 ' sister also was charged with evidence tampering			1
a tragedy : @entity82 was shot dead while lying in his stroller @entity48 , who was a key prosecution witness in @entity12 ' trial , is set to go to trial at a later date			2
@entity88 ' attorney asked for bond for his client while they appealed , which the judge denied			0
the defense tried throughout the trial to prove that the investigation was flawed and that police refused to consider other leads or investigate further once they had @entity12 in custody the day after the killing			2
' they finished their case in 25 hours			0
everything else they did after that they just sugarcoated , ' @entity102 said			0
the prosecution 's witnesses - many with a criminal history and some drug users - lied repeatedly and changed their stories throughout the investigation , @entity102 said			2
the defense also said several law enforcement agents backtracked in their testimony to make sure what they were saying fit the state 's version of the story			0

suspicious behavior : @entity36 , mother of slain toddler @entity19 , changed her story about the shooting and even joked with police shortly after the baby 's death but police never really investigated the baby 's parents or the @entity48 cousins , @entity102 said			1
the defense had strongly suggested in pretrial motions that the baby 's parents were the killers			1
lead defense attorney @entity156 , a public defender , made several suggestions to the same effect during the trial			0
but much of his questioning that seemed to be heading in that direction - including attempts to bring up details about the backgrounds of both of the baby 's parents - was blocked by the judge after the prosecution objected			1
prosecutors said the defense presented a lot of theories and speculation but that the evidence and facts in the case proved @entity12 ' guilt			2

they all showed @entity88 in specific locations at specific times the day of the shooting			0
@entity177 also reminded jurors of the testimony of two young women - one who said @entity12 walked her to school at 8:45 the day of the shooting and another who said she spent the night before with @entity133 and ate with him later that morning , which was backed up by video stills of them at a convenience store			2
then @entity177 reminded jurors of what @entity12 told police , that he woke up around 10:30 that morning , that no one else was home and that he left for school around 11:30 a.m. heartbroken : @entity203 , estranged daughter of ms @entity36 , testified that she believes her mother was involved in the baby 's death the only person whose story did n't match the evidence in the case was @entity12 , @entity177 said			1
the story @entity48 told police was very similar to the one @entity51 told , @entity177 said			0
while there was no video of the shooting itself , video evidence in the case supports other parts of @entity48 and @entity51 's stories , @entity177 said			2
@entity177 also took exception to the accusation that police stopped investigating once they arrested @entity12 , noting that they pulled video from various cameras around town and went diving in a pond to recover the gun the following week			0
@entity177 also slammed the defense for picking on @entity51 and her behavior following the shooting : ' does anyone know what the protocol is for how you 're supposed to act when you 've just watched your child get shot in the face ? '			0

@entity240 was found guilty of 11 criminal counts and faces life in prison
@entity36 , the baby 's mother , changed her story about the circumstances surrounding the shooting and even picked the *wrong* suspect out of a criminal lineup
*mr* @entity12 ' conviction came despite strong evidence he may not be the shooter
