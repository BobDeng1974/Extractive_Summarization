shaped like a heart - and with two hands clasped together in decorative sleeves at its base - this piece of jewellery may be tiny but it was to prove an enormous find for one lucky metal detector enthusiast			1
@entity10 , 60 , unearthed the 2.5cm gold brooch beneath the soil in a farmer 's field near @entity15 , @entity16 - and was initially unaware of its true provenance			1
but the item - no bigger than a pound coin - has now been dated to between 1350 and 1450 and is thought to have originally been a betrothal gift because the hands appear to be male and female			1
furthermore , it is worth an astonishing £ 25,000			1
a metal detector enthusiast who found a 2.5cm gold brooch in a farmer 's field is celebrating after it was identified as a medieval piece of jewellery worth £ 25,000 @entity10 , 60 , discovered the treasure near @entity15 , @entity16 experts said it is rare to have a brooch containing the heart and clasped hands together on one piece			1
@entity38 from @entity40 auctioneers in @entity41 , @entity16 , which is selling the brooch , said : ' it is an annular - style brooch that combines two symbols ; a heart and hands clasped			1
' it is rare to find these two symbols together on one brooch and it really is such a fine thing that a jeweller today would struggle to make it			1
' the hands are slightly different , meaning they might be a man and a woman ’s hand - and they are in sleeves , which are decorated			1
' it was probably a betrothal gift from a gentleman to his other half and would originally have belonged to someone of very high standing			1
the brooch has been dated to between 1350 and 1450 and is in the shape of a heart with two clasped hands			1
the size of a pound coin , it is thought it was originally a betrothal gift because the hands appear to be male and female ' it will be of interest to brooch collectors and those who collect medieval jewellery			1
' mr @entity10 made the discovery last june and described it as a ' find of a lifetime '			2
he was not sure what it was at first because it was covered in dirt , but after it was cleaned , he realised it was gold			2
mr @entity10 , who is a works manager for a manufacturing company , has been detecting for over 20 years and will share any proceeds with the farmer incredibly , the jewellery appears to be in perfect condition despite having lain underground for hundreds of years			1
the brooch was reported to the authorities and then sent to the @entity92 for experts to examine			2
and because the @entity95 disclaimed it , there was no need for a treasure trove inquest and it is free to be sold			2

the grandfather , who lives near to the site of his find , said : ' i got permission to dig on the farm in may last year			2
' in other fields , i found copper coinage and musket balls , then i selected a field that had a stream running through it			0
' i was about eight feet from the stream when i got a good signal and i decided to dig it			0
' the brooch was only about four or five inches down and it was covered in dirt , but i could see that it was a precious metal			0
' there was so much dirt that the pin would n’t swing so i put it in a polythene bag and took it to a friend ’s house where we put it in an ultrasonic cleaner			0
' when it came out after about ten minutes i could tell it was quality gold because it gleaned as if it had been polished			0
' it had detail on both sides and the workmanship made me think it was earlier than @entity137			0
' it really was the find of a lifetime			0
you have two weeks after making a find before you have to declare it so i did a bit of research			0
' it is unusual to have the clasped hands and heart together in one piece - the clasped hands are something you find from @entity151			0
' mr @entity38 added : ' it is really exciting			0
' it was found on june 11 last year by a metal detectorist in the @entity15 area			1
' we ca n’t give out any more details of the location for obvious reasons			0
' it was brought in to us by the finder for an insurance valuation and after some research came up with a valuation			0
' it was then sent to the @entity92 so it could be examined , authenticated and documented			0
' it was disclaimed by the @entity95 so there was no need for an inquest and it can now be sold			0
