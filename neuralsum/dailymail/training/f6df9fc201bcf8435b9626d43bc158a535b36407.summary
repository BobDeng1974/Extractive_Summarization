by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 14 may 2013 strangling : @entity1 , of @entity2 , near @entity3 , @entity4 , killed his wife @entity5 , 70 a 72 - year - old father of three strangled his churchwarden wife with a piece of rope after becoming ‘ fixated ’ that their farmhouse would be flooded by heavy rain , a court heard today			1
farmer @entity1 , of @entity2 , near @entity3 , @entity4 , killed his wife of four decades , @entity5 , 70 , and was today ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric hospital			1
the farmer had dug ditches and built a ‘ fortress ’ of sandbags around his £ 250,000 farmhouse , as well as stacking up furniture in anticipation of floods			0
in addition to becoming concerned about flooding , mr @entity1 also wrongly feared that he had lost the title to some of his land			2
a jury at @entity30 took less than 15 minutes to reach a formal finding that the farmer killed his wife , who was found dead by their daughter last december			1
mr @entity1 was not required to attend a two - day ‘ finding - of - fact ’ trial after being judged unfit to plead			1
the trial heard that the popular and respected farmer was suffering from a ‘ severe mental disturbance ’ at the time of the killing and confessed to detectives during police interviews			1
during the interviews , extracts of which were read to the jury today , mr @entity1 claimed to have ‘ flipped ’ on the spur - of - the - moment and strangled his wife with a blue piece of cord			1
mr @entity1 , who was found ‘ comatose ’ at the scene of the killing , told officers : ‘ i do n't know why i did it			2
i do n't know what came over me			0
i do n't know why it happened , but it happened			0
’ the court heard yesterday that mr @entity1 was found slumped in a chair with cable ties around his neck , having apparently trying to take his own life			1
asked by police if he had tried to take his own life , mr @entity1 replied : ‘ yes			2
because of what i had done to @entity5			0
’ investigation : police at the farmhouse in @entity2 , @entity4 , last december , where the couple lived jurors heard that the @entity71 ' farm flooded in 2007 , forcing the couple to live in a caravan for 18 months			1
although the ‘ much - admired ’ couple had been happily married for more than 45 years , it is thought that mr @entity1 tried to smother his wife with a pillow two weeks before the fatal incident			1
the court heard that in september last year , mr @entity1 's family became concerned over his mental health and he was due to see a psychiatrist on the day he killed his wife			1
prosecutor @entity83 said : ‘ it was getting to the point of complete fixation about the risk of flooding and the possibility the family might be somehow rendered homeless			0
’ detective chief inspector @entity91 , who led the inquiry , told the trial that the couple were regarded as pillars of the local community			0
there was no evidence to suggest that anyone harboured any ‘ ill - will ’ towards the @entity71 , the officer said , and nothing had been found to cast doubt on the truth of mr @entity1 's confession			2
' i do n't know why i did it			0
i do n't know what came over me			0
i do n't know why it happened , but it happened ' what @entity1 told police members of the couple 's family attended the court hearing but did not comment afterwards			2
in a statement issued following the verdict , mr @entity91 , of the @entity118 major crime unit , said : ‘ the death of @entity120 at the hands of her husband @entity122 was a tragic family event			0
‘ their three children - @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 - have not only lost their mother but their father remains in hospital receiving treatment for his illness			0
the family have behaved with immense dignity in the face of this terrible tragedy and continue to fully support their father			0
‘ nobody could have predicted this sad event but some time after november last year his mental health deteriorated and he took his wife 's life and attempted to take his own			0
‘ i would like to thank the community of @entity2 for their support and co-operation throughout this inquiry as well as the officers , who performed their duty with sensitivity and professionalism			2
’ judge @entity152 said mr @entity1 would now stay in the secure hospital until his health improved - when he would then be tried normally .			1
