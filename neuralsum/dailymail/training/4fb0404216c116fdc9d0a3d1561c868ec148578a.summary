by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:52 est , 17 february 2014 for a string of middle - aged single women struggling with their finances , he seemed to be a knight in shining armour			1
having met @entity9 on a dating website and fallen for his charm , he would reveal that he was an £ 118million lottery winner with a fleet of luxury cars			1
and , what ’s more , he wanted to pay off all their debts			2
but @entity9 was in fact a homeless conman who travelled across the country in his @entity19 , a court heard , gaining the trust of vulnerable women before raiding their bank accounts			1
lesson : victim @entity25 , 57 , ( left ) was duped by @entity9 on a dating website the 41 - year - old – who claimed to own a hotel complex in @entity29 and a large house in the exclusive @entity32 resort of @entity33 – swindled more than £ 45,000 from at least six women , between september 2011 and march 2013			1
after meeting on popular dating sites – including @entity36 – and gaining their trust , he told them he would help with their financial problems			0
but once he had their bank details , he would secretly steal large amounts of money from them			2
the conman showed the women photographs of at least eight luxury cars he supposedly owned – including @entity50 and @entity51 – but he in fact had no permanent home and the only vehicle he owned was a 2003 @entity19			1
one victim gave up her rented house believing they were moving in together , while another broke off a long - term relationship to be with him			2
and one was left by the roadside after believing she was about to be taken on the holiday of a lifetime – only for him to drive off in search of his next victim			0
on friday , @entity9 admitted eight charges of theft , three charges of fraud and a charge of making off without payment for hotel accommodation			1
yesterday he was jailed for 59 months			2
his victims came from towns across the country , from @entity78 to @entity32			0
@entity79 told the @entity80 how she was so convinced by his fake identity after meeting him in july 2011 that she quickly introduced him to her parents , her three grown - up children and friends			0
‘ my family thought he was amazing – as did i. he was charming and complimentary and seemed very genuine , ’ she said			0
like many of the other women he seduced , he only told @entity87 he was ‘ secretly wealthy ’ around three weeks into the relationship , saying he wanted to attract the ‘ right kind of woman ’ and not someone looking for money			1
devastated : @entity79 ' house was also ransacked by @entity9 around the same time @entity9 – who also claimed he was a member of the upmarket @entity95 clothing company dynasty – offered to help with her finances			1
he told the 48 - year - old driving instructor from @entity99 that he hated to see her in so much debt and that he wanted to pay off all her credit card bills – and pretended to do so in front of her on the phone			0
but instead , he began gradually stealing small amounts from her savings account as well as pretending to ‘ invest ’ large amounts of her money			1
six weeks into the relationship – and still unaware of the money that he had slowly stolen from her – the conman promised to whisk miss @entity79 to @entity115			1
but after waiting in vain at her daughter ’s house for him to pick her up , she returned home to find it had been ransacked and he had stolen several family heirlooms			0
‘ i was devastated , ’ she said			0
‘ i feel like i ’ve been to hell and back and i do n’t think i can trust anyone again			0
’ she claims he stole £ 20,000 from her in total			2
another victim , @entity25 , 57 , from @entity127 , told the @entity80 last night how @entity9 stole more than £ 11,000 from her over the course of their five - month relationship			1
scam : @entity9 used sites like @entity36 to meet vulnerable women and eventually run off with their money having seduced them with elaborate lies around three weeks after meeting in january 2012 , he told her he wanted to invest her money in his @entity29 hotel business			1
‘ i was to head up this operation on a salary of £ 100,000 to recruit and train the employees , ’ the learning and development professional said			2
‘ this of course never happened			0
i gave him my money and he “ invested ” it			1
’ the divorced mother of three added : ‘ i have moved on and learnt to evaluate people more closely			0
this is a lesson for other women to be careful			2
‘ i would never have thought i ’d be sucked into such a scam but he seemed completely genuine			0
’ @entity153 heard that @entity9 had 16 previous convictions dating back to 1993 for offences including deception , fraud and burglary			1
recorder @entity159 told him : ‘ you chose vulnerable victims			0
you moved from one victim to another when the money ran out			1
it was just a way of living for you			0
‘ you set out the bait			0
they took the bait and you then took their money , their dignity and their self - respect			2
‘ they would be left by the side of the road as you drove off to your next victim			0
’ sentencing : the judge at @entity153 gave the ' conman ' almost five years in prison for his fraud			1

@entity9 lied that he was worth £ 118m thanks to *euromillions* win
conman said he had mansions , *yachts* and *supercars* but was homeless
six women gave him £ *43,000* to invest but he ran off with the money
@entity9 was jailed for almost five years at @entity153 today
