by @entity0 @entity1 believes @entity2 should not be rushed into management , but he does accept the coach could one day take on his current job as @entity7 boss			1
@entity2 's critically - acclaimed tactical analysis on @entity9 , and his role as a coach on @entity1 's backroom staff , meant he was mentioned as an outside bet to replace the @entity7 manager when his place came under scrutiny last week			1
@entity1 's position was quickly secured , though , meaning he @entity2 , and the rest of the backroom staff will continue with the 66 - year - old until @entity21			1
@entity22 for @entity7 to field young players for final @entity25 match master and apprentice : @entity1 talks with @entity2 during training in @entity29 but when asked whether @entity2 could be an @entity7 manager in the future , @entity1 said : ' of course he can be			1
' but it would be wrong to start putting him under pressure to suggest ' you need to get down to some work in a club side because the @entity7 manager 's job is there waiting for you '			2
who knows ? when the job comes up again , who knows what candidates there will be			0
' some have questioned whether @entity2 should be allowed to publicly criticise @entity7 players on @entity9 when he then has to work with them on international duty			2
but @entity1 is more than happy for @entity2 to continue with his punditry duty			2
@entity49 : @entity2 tries to motivate @entity50 after the striker scores the equaliser against @entity53 sinking feeling : @entity1 and @entity2 look dejected as @entity7 suffer defeat to @entity55 in fact , @entity1 thinks @entity2 should not be in any rush to ditch his tv role and move into full - time management			1
@entity1 said : ' having a long career in football gets harder and harder			0
' the number of jobs available vis - a - vis the amount of time people spend in those jobs gets less and less , so i certainly would n't advise him necessarily to jump at the first opportunity to do coaching or management			0
' the longer he can combine the two roles ( coaching and punditry ) the better			0
' but i do n't have any doubt in my mind that he will become a top - class football coach and top - class manager			0
' @entity2 ( right ) appearing on @entity9 's @entity78 with fellow pundit @entity79			0

@entity1 's place as @entity7 boss has come under scrutiny
the @entity85 have backed @entity1 however , with the manager backed to remain in charge until @entity21
@entity2 is a coach for @entity7 under @entity1 and his tactical analysis for @entity90 is *widely* *respected*
