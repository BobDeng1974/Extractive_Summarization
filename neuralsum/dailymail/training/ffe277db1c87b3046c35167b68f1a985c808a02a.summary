dwindling in numbers , whale sharks are protected in @entity2 - and black market salesmen are punished with hefty fines			1
but when fisherman @entity6 , 48 , spotted this 16 - foot - long , two - tonne beast , he could not resist having a go			1
he heaved it to shore and dragged it to the street			0
then , incredibly , he dumped it onto a truck - and drove it for half - an - hour to the nearest market			1
but @entity6 , from @entity19 , in the far - eastern province of @entity29 , admitted he planned to sell the creature from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan ( around £ 1,000 to £ 2,000 )			2
he claims the fish was already dead by the time they reached the market in @entity25 , 10 miles away , after accidentally getting caught in his fishing net			2
trapped : the endangered mammal had broken into his fishing net and started eating all the fish he had caught despite strict laws against selling whale sharks , @entity40 could sell his ( for £ 1,000 ) because it was already dead he told local media he did not know it was a whale shark			1
' the giant creature broke our net and got inside to eat the fish we caught , ' he explained			0
' as you can see it had eaten a fair few but after being trapped in the net , it had died			0
valuable : the enormous creatures can live for up to 100 years and weigh around 20 tonnes at full maturity fascinated : passers - by were astounded to see @entity6 , 48 , trundling through the village with the whale shark ' by the time we managed to free it , sadly it was too late			2
' it was really unfortunate and we did our best to free it , but having caught it and because it was already dead , it seemed a shame to waste it			0
' i asked the fish market officials that monitor this sort of thing , and they said that as it was already dead when we caught it and as it was there we may as well sell it			0

@entity6 drove 16ft , two - tonne whale for half - an - hour to market
whale sharks are protected *species* in @entity2 , salesmen face hefty fines
when they reached the market , it was dead so he was allowed to sell it
