a couple of weeks back , after @entity3 ’s fiery 1 - 0 win over @entity4 , @entity1 ’s support team took swift and decisive action over a series of deeply unpleasant tweets			1
on february 10 , 2015 , one user wrote ‘ i hope you get shot you utter w * * * * * ’ in response to a piece i had written about @entity14 ’s reaction to @entity4 substitute @entity15			2
the same day , an @entity18 supporter sent the message ‘ kill yourself ’ , without even referencing anything i 'd written about the club			2
it was by no means a unique experience			2
@entity14 got to grips with @entity15 in angry exchange during @entity3 's win over @entity4 ... the incident , a major flashpoint in the game at @entity28 last month , was covered by reporters ... and at that point the @entity1 users took it as their invite to join the party click here to follow @entity34 on twitter there was worse , much worse , but publishing the depressing details , which would bring a family member of mine into the public domain , would be an invasion of privacy - and the accounts involved , along with many others that week , were suspended for violating @entity1 ’s rules			1
the motivation behind this piece is because the @entity49 ’s head of sport was genuinely taken aback by the scale and sheer venom of the attacks that can take place on this forum			2
this is the life of a football reporter in 2015 , waking up to indiscriminate messages each morning in the same casual manner you check your phone for texts			2
social media should be a theatre for healthy debate , a chance to forcefully bat around some ideas or opinions about a sport many of us have devoted our lives to			1
unfortunately @entity1 has become the elephant in the room , the one subject we are reluctant to discuss in depth because an admission that the medium can be psychologically taxing is perceived as a weakness			1
toughen up , grow some , and all those other things people say when they are unable to accept that these are serious issues to confront			0
the experiences described above are by no means novel : on the night of saturday december 11 , 2010 it was impossible to monitor the number of people who threatened my life when @entity91 ’s transfer request was reported			0
a piece about @entity91 , pictured here unhappy at being substituted by @entity93 in december 2010 , just before his transfer request , did not go down too well with some people out in cyber space @entity91 is much happier now at @entity97 ... @entity1 can still be just as horrible and angry a place though there are people who will tell you that this is part of the game , that these attacks are just @entity1 trolls hiding behind the anonymity of a keyboard in a bedroom at their parents ’ house			1
if it is true , it does n’t mean we have to accept it , either			0
to many we have the best job in the world , roaming the country to watch the biggest matches in the @entity119 and heading overseas for the @entity120 , or with the national team at @entity122			2
this is the boyhood dream , a personal obsession after realising at a very , very early age that a career playing the sport professionally would be beyond question			0
@entity1 is a modern phenomenon , a bear pit for the football reporters who cross a very fine line when they write about some of the most high - profile issues in the game			1
@entity34 during an interview with @entity139 last year when the @entity137 player responded to comments made by then - manager @entity141			0
@entity139 was answering claims he was overweight @entity34 is up for sports news reporter of the year at the @entity145 @entity144 this month - an award he won during his time at the @entity148 ( above with long - time @entity150 man @entity149 ) many will argue that journalists , with the undoubted privileges we enjoy at times , are fair game			1
others will have similar experiences and many - admirably , as it happens - put it down to a hazard of the job			0
@entity163 knows we dish out enough stick to clubs and managers over the decisions they make and there will be people who argue that we should learn to take our medicine			2
the abuse , though , is pure cyanide			0
sadly it also affects dialogue , with sensible tweets often lost in an avalanche of poison if you happen to write something even remotely controversial about a team , a player or manager			0
errors are seized upon , with reporters called to account in a way that was never possible until @entity186 dreamed up @entity1 in 2006			1
it ’s fine to spar , with people such as @ cfcaway , @ terrencethecat or @ wisepoyet frequently pulling me up on pieces that have been written about the goings - on at @entity3			0
they never overstep the mark , but they do have an opinion and can , on occasion , show a sense of humour			2
@entity186 , pictured in october last year , is a co-founder of @entity1 surely this is an environment we should encourage , to take responsibility and trade messages about subjects in an atmosphere that is not intoxicated with bile , abuse , threats or intimidation			1
it feels naive to write that , particularly when you learn about the experience of @entity219 referee @entity218 in 2013			0
he attempted suicide after he was bombarded with , among other things , abuse such as ‘ fat , red hamster ’ on social media			1
how sad that it came to that			0
it is little wonder that @entity1 ’s chief executive @entity231 told the company ’s staff , in a leaked email in mid-february , that it was time to clampdown on the pollution in this social forum			1
‘ we suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we ’ve sucked at it for years , ’ he told employees			0
( from left ) @entity186 , at the @entity245 in 2013 with co-founders @entity247 , @entity248 and chief executive @entity231 , who outlined the need to find a way of getting rid of the pollution on @entity1 ‘ it ’s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day			1
we lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day			0
’ in the days after @entity231 ’s memorandum was leaked to the media , the company began to take action on the users mentioned above , along with scores of others who were being abusive or harassing people			1
when they suspended the account of one , he returned under a different guise on monday evening to warn that that i was no longer safe			0
people like that need to be educated			0
this is an opportunity for @entity1 to evolve , to make it clear that this remarkable concept is to be used in a way that is socially acceptable			1
the issue of trolling , as we know , is not confined to sport			0
in september 2013 the @entity284 admitted they were powerless at times to investigate and prosecute @entity1 trolls for their hounding of various public figures			1
progress is slow , but @entity1 has suspended accounts of those threatening physical violence and have emailed others to remind them that a behavioural policy is in place			1
the intentions are honourable and the moment has arrived for a system of best practice to be observed by its 288m users			2
without it , the minority will continue to distort the experience for the good - natured majority .			0

@entity1 users are quick to *criticise* reporters for their reaction to matches
the messages can be threatening and involve family members
social media should be a theatre for healthy debate and to voice opinion
many will argue that journalists , with the privileges we enjoy , are fair game
