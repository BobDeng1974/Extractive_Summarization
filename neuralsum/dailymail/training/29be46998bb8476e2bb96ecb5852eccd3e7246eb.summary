from the outside it looks like it could still light up a city but the @entity5 power station in @entity6 , @entity0 was living on borrowed time			1
the @entity9 era relic was just weeks from demolition			0
photographer @entity11 thought it was important that he documented the buildings which form part of @entity16 's growing rust belt			1
when it was commissioned in 1943 , it produced enough power for the whole of the city of @entity0 and cope with the demands of war production from the heavy industrial plants			1
the coal - fired plant was wound down in the 1990s as demand for heavy industry declined and attempts to reopen it failed			1
eventually it was earmarked for demolition			0
@entity31 power station in @entity33 looks like it is a ready to provide electricity for thousands of homes across the area inside however , the control room looks like something from a bygone era banks of analogue dials and switches , and a distinct lack of flat screens monitors deeper inside the aged building , which was demolished in 2011 , are the engineering stations where dozens of people had to closely monitor the power station 's output writing on his blog , @entity11 explains : ' after a few years of trying , a good friend of mine was able to arrange a tour of the @entity54 less than a year before it was demolished			1
while the plant was a lot more modern and was much less decayed than some i have been to , the sheer scale of the plant was amazing			0
' at over 11 stories , there was simply no way to see the whole plant in a day , but we did cover quite a bit of ground			0
the engineer who lead us through the plant knew every aspect of its operation and was nearly as interesting as the plant itself			0
it was an exhausting day in a string of long days out taking pictures , but it was still a disappointment when it ended and even moreso when the plant was demolished and the opportunity to return was gone forever			0
' as well as power plants , @entity11 , 36 , has also shot empty churches , hotels , hospitals and prisons			1
@entity11 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , revealed two of the sites he photographed - @entity89 in @entity90 and @entity54 in @entity91 - were demolished soon after			1
he estimates that he has photographed more than a dozen power plants all featured in his soon to be released book @entity16 : the @entity95			2
@entity11 said : ' i do quite a bit of research to identify locations i 'd like to photograph and i 'm fortunate i have friends who have helped me out with connections or information			2
' he said : ' it 's important to me to work with people who manage these sites to present the places in a way that does n't cause them any problems			2
' they can also be quite dangerous so you have to be very careful			0
but they are also my favorite type of places to photograph			0
' people seem fascinated by these sorts of places too			0
' most of us will never get to see what the inside of a power plant looks like yet we 're dependent on them to produce the electricity that powers everything in our homes			2
' more information on @entity11 's photography tours to abandoned locations can be found on his @entity130 page the amazing images form part of photographer @entity11 's @entity16 series which documents the rusting hulks of the nation 's industrial heritage according to @entity11 , he wanted to capture the building which was completed in the early 1940s for posterity before it was eventually demolished despite working in a power station , the operator of this antiquated phone had to spin the wheel to generate enough current to carry his phone call this is the @entity147 of the @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity148 which was demolished in 2008 , providing a view into the industrial past these turbines used to spin furiously generating power for thousands of people and businesses across the east coast of the @entity156 but along with the demise of heavy industry in the area , the need for old fashioned , coal - fired power stations was lessened and they were eventually decommissioned @entity11 travelled across the east coast of the @entity156 documenting the decline in the rust belt states as heavy industry moved on the giant machines look like they have been created to last for eternity , but much of the metal on display has already been recycled into new goods @entity11 said he wanted to document the industrial past before it was demolished running a coal - fired power station was a massive logistical undertaking with large quantities of fuel needed every day from their own elevated railway the rusting hulk of this turbine marks as a stark reminder of the decline in @entity16 's industrial strength as heavy industry has moved to the far east these coal chutes fed the massive furnaces around the clock with a constant stream of railway carriages providing fuel for the insatiable beast			1

the @entity5 power station in @entity0 first operated in 1943 providing war time energy
less than half - a - *century* later it was *doomed* with the *collapse* of heavy industry and concerns over coal power
the eerie images form part of @entity11 's photographic record of @entity16 's rust belt relics
after the power station closed in the 1990s , metal thieves targeted it and it became a focus for *anti-social* *behaviour*
