there are houses for cold climates , designed to keep in the heat , and there are homes for hot climates , built to allow air to sweep through and keep its owners cool - but never did the two meet , until now			0
a pair of @entity12 architects has designed an incredible ' folding ' house that shapeshifts into eight different configurations and automatically adapts to the changing seasons			1
called @entity17 , the structure was inspired by the work of an early 20th century mathematician who discovered a way to dissect a square and rearrange its parts into an equilateral triangle			1
the ' folding ' house shapeshifts into eight different configurations that automatically adapt to the changing seasons for example , in the summer , bedroom one faces east and tracks the sunrise using a series of sensors			1
as the owner wakes up , the house automatically rotates to ensure they are constantly bathed in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels			2
in winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ' literally hugging itself			2
' as the seasons change and climate warms , the house opens up , ' like a flower ' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings			0
the house is the brainchild of architects @entity65 and @entity67 , who launched the d * haus company to develop the concept			1
the architects said the house will cost £ 2 million ( $ 3.1 million ) , but if they are able to produce in in bulk , this could drop the price to £ 800,000 ( $ 1.2 million )			1
@entity74 * @entity17 literally unfolds itself , ' said the designers			1
' the internal walls become external walls , doors become windows and windows become doors			1
' a house like this has never been done before in the history of architecture and we believe that creating buildings that can adapt and change is a much more sustainable way of living			0
' as the owner wakes up , the house automatically rotates to make sure they are constantly in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels			0
during winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ' literally hugging itself '			2
swipe the yellow bar above to see the house transform the layout consists of two bedrooms , an open - plan living room and a bathroom , but it can be adapted to suit the needs of different living situations			0
aside from moving to provide more light , or expand the view , the house is also designed to save money on heating , and prevent energy waste the largest part of the house would remain stationary with solid foundations , and this is the plumbing , electrics and services would be built			0
each of the component parts of house would be sealed from the elements to keep the internal spaces weatherproof , and when the modules link together a sealed connection similar to a car door would allow transition from one space to another			0
mr @entity67 told @entity134 the team is currently working on a design for the first @entity137 in @entity138 , and is hoping to submit planning permission early next year			1

as the designers explained : ' solar radiation from the sun can have a significant impact on a buildings performance			0
' whilst often a source of overheating due to inadequate controls , with thoughtful design it can provide a cheap and abundant source of energy in your building			0
the design of the moving house was inspired by the work of @entity167 mathematician @entity166			1
in 1908 , mr @entity166 worked out how to turn a square into an equilateral triangle			1
called the @entity166 , each of the pieces are hinged and form a chain that can be transformed into the square , or the original triangle ( @entity175 pictured right )			2
mr @entity166 specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games , and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym ' @entity166 '			2
@entity166 revealed a model of the solution , made of mahogany with brass hinges , at a meeting of the @entity187 on may 17 , 1905			2
he also published the first known crossnumber puzzle in 1926 and has been credited with inventing verbal arithmetic and discovering new applications of digital roots			0
the designers said : ' [ the @entity166 concept ] alone is fascinating and the possibilities are endless when applying the formula to world of architecture and design			1
' based on this design , in the summer , bedroom one of the @entity17 house faces east and watches the sun rise as its owner wakes up			1
it can then rotate so that the user is constantly in sunlight , while the house generates energy through its solar panels			0
during winter , the house is in a square formation , with small windows and high thermal mass , which the designers describe as ' literally hugging itself			2
' as the seasons change and climate warms , the house opens up , ' like a flower opens up ' to allow light and air to penetrate the inside of the building creating panoramic views of the surroundings			0
the internal walls become external walls , doors become windows and windows become doors			1
' this energy can be utilised to heat spaces in winter , provide hot water , and even generate ventilation for cooling in summer			0
' ' conceived for the harsh , climatic extremes from ' @entity237 to @entity238 and @entity239 to @entity240 ' the d * haus concept can respond dynamically to its environment by controlled adaptation to seasonal , meteorological and astronomical conditions , ' continued mr @entity65 and mr @entity67			1
' the flexibility of the @entity137 allows adaptation from winter to summer , and day to night by literally moving inside itself			0
' the thick heavy external walls unfold into internal walls allowing glass internal walls to become facades			1
doors become windows and vice versa			0
' the shape - shifting home was first conceived as part of mr @entity65 's graduation project , for which he designed a house that could withstand the extreme @entity260 temperatures in @entity261			2
the pair 's design is based on the work of @entity167 author and mathematician @entity166 , a leading puzzle creator			1
in 1903 @entity166 invented a way to cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that could be rearranged into a square , a conundrum he dubbed the @entity166			0
the architects said the house ( pictured ) will cost £ 2 million ( $ 3.1 million ) , but if they are able to produce in in bulk , this could drop the price to £ 800,000 ( $ 1.2 million )			1

mr @entity166 specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games , and regularly submitted puzzles to newspaper and magazines under the pseudonym ' @entity166 '			2
in a release , @entity297 described their house concept , as ' a product of an applied mathematical realisation '			0
' the @entity304 is set to cause a revolution in architecture and design by transforming @entity166 ’s idea from the conceptual , to the physical , ' the release adds			2
' inspired by @entity166 ’s logic puzzle , each d * haus dwelling is capable of adapting to changing patterns of living in the future			1
'd * haus is continuing the journey that @entity166 began by breathing new life into a century - old concept ; not only to define a space , but a lifestyle			1

the d * haus architect concept ' *metamorphosizes* ' into eight different configurations based around a series of hinges
it responds to seasonal conditions automatically , or can be moved using *hydraulics* and rails controlled by a handle
the *shapeshiting* design is based on the @entity166 , designed by mathematician @entity166 in 1908
called @entity17 , throughout the year internal walls become external , and doors become windows
architects said the house will cost £ 2 million , but if they are able to produce it in bulk , this will drop to £ 800,000

the designers are hoping to submit planning permission for the building early next year
