@entity0 lost in the region of £ 25m in the deal which saw @entity3 join @entity4			1
the sale of @entity3 was always going to happen this summer as reported in this column first			1
but the predicted £ 100m fee that @entity0 wanted did not materialise			1
@entity8 : @entity3 joined @entity4 with a trademark grin costly : @entity3 's bite on @entity11 hit @entity0 hard in the pocket @entity13 and @entity14 still want @entity15 despite his poor @entity17 showing			1
but the @entity19 striker is being pursued by @entity21 outfit @entity20			1
that was because an auction between @entity4 and @entity24 did not happen			1
@entity24 withdrew any interest after @entity3 ’s bite saga at the @entity17			1
but @entity0 feel they have done well at £ 75 million , even though the @entity28 ’s confirmed buy - out clause was £ 100m			1
@entity29 is poised to leave @entity30 for @entity31			1
@entity32 wanted to sign @entity33 this summer			1
@entity32 would have gone as far as paying @entity33 ’s buy out clause from @entity4 of £ 200million			1
with the addition of crowd funding with sponsors the deal had been a matter of negotiation for months with @entity42 ’s hierarchy and several agents			1
but @entity33 recently signed a new contract with @entity4 worth £ 16.3million a year			1
leader : @entity33 has dragged @entity46 to the @entity17 final with a string of fine displays happy to stay : @entity33 's new deal at @entity4 is worth over £ 16m a year @entity33 is 9 - 2 to be first goalscorer in the @entity17 final with @entity53			1
@entity32 could afford the money given their oil rich @entity56 owners and other partners			2
but the @entity59 , who is the central figure of the @entity17 final , is satisfied with how he has been looked after by @entity4			1
even given the massive amount @entity33 has been paid he showed a sense of loyalty			1
city were willing to outbid @entity4 , but the impact of @entity68 's @entity66 regulations de-railed their bid			1
@entity30 are still trying to lure @entity71 from @entity72 in a £ 40 million deal			1
@entity0 and @entity14 are in a battle for @entity76 striker @entity75			1
after signing @entity78 , @entity77 will try to lure @entity80 midfielder @entity79 in a £ 24m move as the @entity82 seek to re-assert themselves as a @entity84 title contender			1
@entity85 no , i ’ve never seen a game quite like it and i doubt i ever will again			2
it was fantasy fussball from @entity88			2
@entity89 expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre			2
in many ways , they got what they deserved			2
having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish samba soccer in favour of a mean , rough , win at all costs approach insisted upon by manager big @entity108 , they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players , in a superior system , who were never going to be out muscled			2
@entity89 , having sold their soul ended up in hell ; @entity116 , indeed			2
the @entity118 player @entity117 , like all his team - mates , ended up being tortured before being condemned			2
@entity88 passed them to death			2
it was , to turn a phrase on its head , just like watching @entity89 but with added efficiency			0
the football was sublime but ruthless too			0
history makers : @entity88 celebrate their stunning 7 - 1 win over @entity89 in the @entity17 semi-finals yes the absence @entity132 and @entity133 made a difference but in that respect it was a case of bonfire of vanities for @entity89			2
the @entity132 fixation , right down to @entity108 wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium , and the players waving his shirt during the national , undermined them			0
even when @entity147 was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him			0
there were plenty of others who could play @entity154 like @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			0
but having shelved the samba soccer @entity89 did n’t have a clue what to do without @entity132 in attack and without @entity133 had no spine or leadership			0
@entity165 went from being @entity166 of the @entity167 to playing like @entity168			0
@entity169 and @entity170 ? they would n’t even get into the @entity173 team and that ’s saying something			0
in the 1970 semi-final , @entity88 lost a titanic battle 4 - 3 to @entity178 after extra time , in a match which became known of @entity181			1
last tuesday in @entity183 we surely witnessed @entity184			0
distraught : @entity165 ( left ) is comforted by his captain @entity133 after @entity89 's shambolic defeat but for the @entity80 to remember it with pride not just nostalgia then they have to crown it all in @entity193 on sunday and win the @entity17			2
of course , @entity46 wo n’t roll over like @entity89 did			0
and there is a certain @entity33 to deal with			1
but if @entity88 produce another performance close to that level then surely they will crack @entity46 so that the names of @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity71 , @entity202 @entity201 and @entity204 et al will be up there with @entity17 legends of any era			1
and after such an entertaining @entity17 , it would be fitting if the winners are the team who have consistently played the best and we are left to reflect that @entity88 delivered @entity211			0
@entity212 most people ’s abiding memories of the 1986 @entity17 are @entity216 ’s two goals against the @entity173 ; the @entity217 in the 51st minute in the quarter - final then three minutes later the @entity219 as @entity46 won 2 - 1			2
@entity216 then scored two more remarkable goals in the semi-final win over @entity19			0
in the final @entity216 did not notch			0
but after @entity88 had come from a two goal deficit and with @entity46 on the ropes @entity216 produced a sublime pass that was ‘ half a goal ’ , as he released @entity226 who raced clear to score the winner six minutes from time			0
@entity217 : @entity216 handles the ball past @entity229 of @entity173 in 1986 brilliant : @entity216 scores his second , sublime goal against @entity173 in the last - eight clash in 1986 @entity232 it seems a long time since @entity173 shuffled out of the @entity17 after a woeful showing			2
but the @entity237 game still has a massive allure given the global popularity of the @entity84			0
it ’s what attracts so much tv and sponsorship money			0
and it ’s good to see some companies putting something back too			0
as part of their @entity250 project , the mobile network giant flew over an under 15 team from @entity252 , the @entity253 , to compete against four @entity255 teams in @entity256 last week			0
the action was streamed back to their village at a pop up cinema			0
but clearly there is plenty of work to do at grass roots level in this country given the @entity267 won the tournament with some ease			0
ones to watch : @entity267 side @entity253 celebrate their win in @entity256 humble beginnings : the team from @entity252 faced four @entity237 sides and won the tournament btw it seems there are some @entity278 fans who are getting hot under the collar about the change to their club badge			0
the club have ditched the back drop of the @entity284 , given they will move to the @entity285 in a couple of years , and now have a simpler crest of two hammers , like the club had in the glory days of the @entity291			0
they have also added the name @entity256			0
both moves seem sensible to enhance the club ’s brand without ditching the heritage			0
exploiting the name @entity256 is especially shrewd			0
besides , over the years @entity278 have had 15 badge designs , eight of which have not had the castle			0
and to those stick in the muds , in the early 1900 ’s the club was advertised as @entity305 y - factor why do footballers keep lying ? on the one hand @entity3 says he is ‘ leaving @entity0 with a heavy heart ’			1
but then he says that ‘ playing in @entity310 is a lifelong dream			0
’ the truth is he could n’t wait to get out of @entity0 this summer despite having led them to @entity315 football so that he could fulfil an ambition and earn more money			1
so why not just admit it ? or bite his lip ? done deal : @entity3 completed his £ 75m move to @entity4 from @entity0 on friday			1

the bidding *war* between @entity4 and @entity24 did not materialise
real lost interest after @entity3 's bite on @entity11
city were prepared to match @entity33 's £ 200m buy - out clause
but @entity33 signed a new £ 16.3m deal and is happy at the @entity332
@entity30 still want @entity72 's @entity71
@entity77 want to sign @entity79 from @entity24
@entity13 and @entity14 are keen on @entity15
@entity0 and @entity14 are in a battle for @entity76 striker @entity75
