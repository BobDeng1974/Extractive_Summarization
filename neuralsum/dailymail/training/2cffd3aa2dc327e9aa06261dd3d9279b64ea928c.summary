by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 10:21 est , 21 august 2012 landowner @entity1 has seen more combine harvesters than any farmer in the country - after hoarding 350 of the machines for parts			1
mr @entity1 , has amassed the staggering collection of agricultural vehicles so he can break them down and sell on the parts , and his huge haul is now so large it is visible on @entity14 's satellite cameras			1
the enterprising farmer , 69 , runs his business from @entity17 near @entity18 , @entity19 , having started it when he was hunting for wheels for his digger			2
mr @entity1 , who has run the farm where he lives with wife @entity39 , 65 , since 1968 , said : ' it all started when i got a price for new tyres for a digger			1
' i found i could buy an old combine for less and get the tyres off that			0
then somebody wanted its engine so i sold that			0
' a year later at the @entity50 , i was talking to someone from not far away who had two @entity53 and i bought them both			0
' the next thing i knew i had about 50 of the things and it became more of a business than the farming - it ’s the main business now			0
' high turnover : mr @entity1 said he has bought between 50 and 60 combine harvesters each year for the past two decades well - oiled machine : mr manners ' combine parts business in @entity18 , @entity19 , is now bigger than his farming business his business , @entity66 , has now grown into the biggest breaker of combines in the @entity69 , supplying farmers and trade with used parts			1
most of the combines arrive in tact at the farm but are dismantled to order when parts are needed			1
the business has even shipped parts as far away as @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
mr @entity85 ’s buys the combines and his sons @entity88 and @entity89 are in charge of sales and distribution			0
lucrative : with some combines worth hundreds of thousands of pounds , mr @entity1 ' sideline has become his main source of income valuable : mr @entity1 is currently enjoying his most profitable time of year , as farmers seek combine parts for the harvesting season @entity1 travels the country buying harvesters , paying anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand pounds and sells on second hand and reconditioned parts , which include grain pans , wheels , unloading augers , engines , sieves and shaker shoes			1
with a brand new combine harvester costing hundreds of thousands of pounds farmers are looking to save money by buying parts			2
@entity1 added : ' it ’s harvest season so it ’s the busiest time of the year for me			2
' we ’ve bought about fifty to sixty combines a year for the last twenty years			0
i bought less when this first started , but the business has grown a lot over the years			0
' video : @entity1 and his combine harvesters ... hear from the man how he ended up with this lot !			1

@entity1 first started collecting combines in 1974 , and now has enough machines to cover an acre of land
@entity129 makes so much from selling on combine parts it is now his biggest source of income
