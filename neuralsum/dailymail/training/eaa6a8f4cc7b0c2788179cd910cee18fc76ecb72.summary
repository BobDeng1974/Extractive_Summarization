ever since then it was kept in secretive private collections until 2008 when a head was found in mr @entity16 ’s attic , who claimed he bought it in 1953			2
in their examinations of the monarch 's head , @entity36 and @entity37 found features often seen in the king 's portraits , including a dark wound above his right nostril			1
