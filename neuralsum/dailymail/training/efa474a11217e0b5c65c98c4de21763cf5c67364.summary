by @entity0 published : 13:17 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 01:36 est , 3 april 2013 the staff association representing a police officer who is suing a suspected burglary victim has defended her and said it had ' failed to prepare her '			1
@entity5 @entity4 , 33 , is taking legal action against garage owner @entity7 , 50 after she fell on a kerb while attending a suspected break - in			1
lawyers claim mr @entity7 was at fault for failing to ensure the officer was ' reasonably safe ' , making no attempt to light the area or warn her about the step when she went to the incident in @entity19 , @entity20 , in august last year			1
the case has caused controversy and strong reactions			2
@entity24 @entity4 , left , is suing burglary victim @entity7 , right , after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage , pictured , while investigating a break - in @entity28 , chair of the @entity29 came to the constable ’s aid			1
he said : ' it is important that the public understand that police officers are not financially compensated by their own force for injuries received on duty and in fact can lose money through half pay and reduction in allowances			2
' it may also affect their future prospects concerning promotion , specialisation and in some cases their continuation in their job			2
' there is no distinction between on and off duty injury or illness and whilst the government may wish to reduce litigation culture , there must be some alternative put in place			0
' let me be clear - to vilify this female officer is wrong			1
@entity62 tripped while investigating the break in at the @entity64 in @entity19 , @entity20			2
owner @entity7 said it is example of the ' fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident ' ' she took legal advice as to how she could claim back some of her lost earnings as a result of the injury , and at this stage no formal proceedings have taken place			1
' she has been supported by my own organisation , the @entity29 , who have agreed to fund her on a conditional fee basis should the matter progress			1
' in my view it is actually we that should be looking at our processes and structures in terms of how we provide advice - she is our member and i feel that our organisation has failed to prepare her for the wider personal impact that might arise from such a claim			2
' this is regardless of her right to take this action in law , and the merits of the case which i am not able to discuss			2
' mr @entity28 said the @entity29 ’s structure was being independently reviewed			1
chief constable @entity100 ( left ) has spoken of his ' disappointment ' but @entity28 ( right ) , chairman of the @entity29 has come to the constable 's aid he added : ' while @entity105 may be an easy target as she is one individual within a media storm , for me it is the @entity29 that needs to be mindful of the widespread public and member perception that has arisen out of this claim , and address that where relevant in our advice going forward			1
' the officer ’s father , @entity117 , earlier said his daughter would drop the lawsuit after being upset at the strong reaction it prompted			2
mr @entity117 , 58 , told the @entity123 she felt she had been ' persecuted '			0
he added : ' all she did was follow standard police procedure			0
' there was never any mention of figures			0
' she was expecting a couple of grand , not £ 50,000			0
' @entity4 wants to drop the claim to prove she ’s not a money - grabber , not because she feels she ’s done anything wrong			1
' yesterday pc @entity7 ’s boss , chief constable @entity100 spoke of his ' disappointment ' over the matter			1
mr @entity100 said : ' this type of claim does not represent the approach and attitude of the overwhelming majority of our staff who understand and accept the risks inherent in policing and which they willingly confront to keep the public they serve safe			0
' it is a disappointment that this is potentially undermined by a private compensation claim			0
' a @entity153 spokesman said yesterday : ' this legal action is not supported by the @entity153 , our understanding being that the action is funded and supported by the @entity29 , a position over which the @entity153 has no control			1
' @entity105 and mr @entity7 were checking the outside of the building after an alarm had gone off , when she is alleged to have fallen and injured herself			2
a letter from her law firm @entity167 , seven months after the incident , claims she injured her left leg and right wrist and went to the @entity171			0
further questions also remain over the role of the @entity29 in brokering the civil legal action by one of its members			1
the @entity178 revealed frontline officers are receiving millions of pounds every year from personal injury claims from a @entity29 - backed service			1
lawyers behind the free claimline boast they have recovered £ 42million in the last two years alone after suing over slips and trips , workplace accidents and negligence			0
@entity188 , @entity20 ’s police and crime commissioner , said @entity62 ’s behaviour was ‘ appalling ’ and ‘ leaves me cold ’			0
he said : ‘ of course , there are officers who deserve to receive help when they are injured in the course of duty and the public would readily support this			0
@entity62 , i suspect , is not one of them			0
’ @entity201 , @entity202 mp for @entity20 , called on the home secretary to ‘ get a grip ’ of the situation immediately			0
he said : ‘ will a firefighter sue because they do n’t like flames or a paramedic because they ca n’t stand blood ? this threatens the fabric of our emergency services			0
‘ the public need to know they can have confidence that the police will investigate a crime without trying to sue them			0
