the magazine has always courted controversy , from modern - day protests that it objectifies women , to a court case in 1963 during which @entity13 was accused of publishing obscene material during the case @entity13 stood in his own defence , and eventually the case was thrown out as a mistrial after he argued that the difference between obscenity and art was a matter for individual taste staying ahead of the curve of public opinion , in 1971 the magazine was the first to feature a picture of @entity147 model @entity146 on its front page during the 80s the mansion got its reputation for allegedly hosting wild parties and orgies , fuelled by alcohol , cannabis and cocaine			2
