a man has opened up about what happened when he discovered his identity had been stolen online and used to contact dozens of women			1
at first , @entity4 , a freelance creative designer from @entity5 , did n't think much of it when a stranger e-mailed him to say she had been speaking to a man online who was using his pictures under a different name			1
but it soon became clear that the problem went way deeper than just the one instance			0
' @entity26 ' was using recent pictures from @entity4 's facebook page as well as old ones from his deleted @entity38 account in order to assume his identity and over a period of four to five years , he had sent thousands of emails using @entity4 's pictures			1
he contacted women through dating sites , social media platforms and teenage forums , using several different email addresses and charming them with poetry and his supposed love of music			1
even after @entity4 confronted them , some of the women did n't understand that he and ' @entity26 ' were not the same person			1
speaking to @entity55 , @entity4 said : ' some of the girls had been speaking to him for five years and thought they were in a relationship with " me "			1
' that 's when things started to get creepy and strange but above all worrying as it was clear he was spending a lot of time talking to young girls using my identity			0
' he tried contacting the police , but to no avail - they told him there is no law preventing people from taking his online pictures , since he had them on a public setting eventually , one of the women hacked into ' @entity26 's ' account and discovered his true identity - a 65 - year - old married man from the @entity79 living in @entity80			1
after @entity4 tracked him down online , ' @entity26 ' apologised , describing himself as ' just a sad lonely man ' and claiming that he was mentally unwell			1
still , @entity4 felt that justice needed to be served - not just for him , but for the dozens of girls and women ' @entity26 ' had duped			1
so he tried contacting the police , but to no avail			0
he was sent to @entity87 , which deals with internet crime , but they told him there was not much they could do about it			2
their advice was to edit his privacy settings or take down his accounts altogether , but @entity4 did n't want to give his impostor that satisfaction			2
he said : ' they told me to just make my profiles private - that 's not a response , that 's just sticking your head in the sand and pretending it wo n't happen to the next person			0
' i 'm not going to miss out on meeting new people , getting new business or being myself by not embracing social media or the 21st century			0
' despite the incident , @entity4 has decided not to let it affect his online life			2
he said : ' i do n't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things ' instead , he believes it 's time law was updated in order to protect internet users from this kind of criminal behaviour			0
' there was a clear and obvious pattern of grooming where he would take them from a public forum , to a private email , to speaking on @entity132 or on the phone , ' he said			0
' that 's the most creepy thing and worrying behaviour about this - and the police still were n't interested despite all the evidence			0
' i was worried that if this was just the tip of the iceberg - who was this man ? what would he do if i told the police ? ' also , what would the family of these girls think of " me " despite the fact it was n't me doing all this - it was someone using my face			2
' @entity4 has spent the last few months attempting to get all 15 of ' @entity26 's ' fake social media profiles taken down , an arduous process that has yet to be completed			2
when @entity4 's imposter was finally tracked down , he was revealed to be a pensioner in @entity80 ( picture posed by model ) one social media site told him that his impostor did nâ€™t break their ' community usage policy ' , while another never replied to his emails			0
despite the fact that some of the fake accounts are still up to this day , @entity4 has decided not to let it affect his online life			1
he said : ' i 've met some of my closest friends online as well as an ex-boyfriend too			0
' i do n't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things			0
