but he escaped with a suspended sentence after a judge decided that it would cause ‘ suffering ’ for his family			1
the father of one of the girls , who both had to give evidence to @entity30 , said the judge ’s decision showed no recognition of the impact the assault had on his eight - year - old daughter			1

@entity86 , defending , had told the judge : ‘ @entity88 will almost certainly lead to him losing his job			2
if he loses his liberty and they lose their house , that would have pretty devastating consequences on the family circumstances			0

‘ we have put her through this – and ourselves – and for what ? if i had known the outcome i would not have bothered			0
’ he continued : ‘ i ’ve worked with people who have lost their livelihoods when they ’ve had points deducted from their licences and been banned from driving for minor driving offences yet a paedophile is allowed to walk the streets ? it is ridiculous			0
