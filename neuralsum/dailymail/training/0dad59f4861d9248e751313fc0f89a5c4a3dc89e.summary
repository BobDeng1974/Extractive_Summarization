from the forest elephants of @entity2 , to @entity4 ’s tigers and even our own harbour seals , wildlife is losing the battle for survival all over the world			1
exotic mammals such as the magnificent big cats are under the greatest threat , but even here in @entity15 numbers of once - familiar species have collapsed			2
and responsible for this dramatic decline is man			0
in fact , humankind ’s ever - growing need for land and resources , coupled with hunting and poaching , has halved the number of wild animals in world in just 40 years , according to a shocking report			1
the @entity30 by @entity31 and the @entity32 has found that wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970			1
it shows that @entity46 animals have not escaped the global decline			2
the audit , which is published every two years , found that 90 per cent of corn buntings , a bird once often seen perched on fences , have disappeared from our countryside			1
endangered : there are only around 3,200 tigers left in the wild - the predators ' numbers have declined by a huge 97 per cent in the last 100 years worldwide problem : fewer than 100,000 forest elephants now remain , as their numbers have dropped by 60 per cent in just 12 years the number of northern lapwings – another once - familiar sight on farmland – have fallen 60 per cent and grey partridges have halved in number			1
harbour seals have declined by 40 per cent in the last decade alone in @entity69 and @entity70 , killed off by disease and measures to protect salmon farms			1
@entity46 snakes , such as the adder , have plummeted in number as open fields are taken over for housing			0
the global picture is worst for freshwater creatures such as amphibians , river fish and mammals , with average population declines of 76 per cent between 1970 and 2010 , says the latest data available			2
land - dwelling animals declined by 39 per cent over the same period and sea creatures fell 39 per cent , the report found			1
the authors said the main threats to wildlife are loss or damage to their habitat and exploitation through hunting and fishing			0
closer to home : animals are dying out on @entity46 shores too , including the harbour seal , which has been threatened by disease and salmon farming nowhere to live : @entity15 's birds , like this corn bunting , are also under threat - largely from the loss of bushy field edges for nesting in they also warned that humans are using resources faster than the planet can provide , cutting down forests too quickly , overfishing and pumping out pollution faster than the world can cope with it			1
professor @entity117 , director of science at @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , said : ‘ the scale of biodiversity loss and damage to the very ecosystems that are essential to our existence is alarming			0
this damage is not inevitable , but a consequence of the way we choose to live			0
’ @entity129 , chief executive of @entity31 , said : ‘ the scale of destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake - up call to us all			0
we all have an interest , and a responsibility , to act to ensure we protect what we all value : a healthy future for both people and nature			0
’ under the sea : the threat to our wildlife is not just limited to land animals - the short - nosed common dolphin and leatherback turtle are also dying out mr @entity129 said consumers could reduce their impact on wildlife by choosing products which were sustainable , for example fish with the @entity153 and timber with the @entity156 certifications			2
he said that they could also look at reducing their meat and dairy consumption			0
professor @entity161 , director of conservation programmes at @entity32 , said people should think about everything they do , from recycling to putting pressure on political and industry leaders , and getting their children outside to reconnect with nature .			0

@entity172 's need for land and resources , *combined* with hunting and poaching , are causing our wild animals to *die* out
wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970 , a new report has found
the likes of forest elephants , *african* lions and tigers are under threat , as well as @entity46 harbour seals and birds
@entity194 numbers dropped 90 per cent in 40 years , tigers by 97 per cent in 100 years and elephants 60 per cent since 2002
