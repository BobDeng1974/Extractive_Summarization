by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 27 november 2013 @entity2 : 06:41 est , 27 november 2013 a teenager suffers from a bizarre ' growth spurt ' condition which means he can grow up to two inches in just two weeks			1
@entity7 ’s condition is so rare that it does n't even have a name and his mother fears her giant son will only get bigger and bigger			1
the 18 - year - old is thought to be the only person in the world to suffer from a bizarre disease which causes dramatic and sudden spurts of growth			1
towering : @entity7 ( with grandmother @entity17 and sister @entity18 ) suffers from a bizarre ' growth spurt ' condition which means he can grow up to two inches in just two weeks @entity7 is currently 6ft 10in , despite his mother @entity21 being just 5ft and his father only 5ft 4in			1
ms @entity21 , 44 , has spent years trying to find out what is wrong with her son			1
she has now been told by scientists in @entity26 that @entity7 has a chromosomal disorder - but it 's so rare that little is known about it			1
it causes @entity7 , of @entity33 , to have rapid spurts of growth - which normally last around two weeks and can see his height rise by as much as two inches			1
ms @entity21 said : ' it is a nightmare - i ca n’t get clothes to fit him			0
i 'm having to look online and am thinking about ordering trousers from @entity41			0
' i do n’t know where it will stop			0
@entity7 is forever banging his head on door frames and has trouble going down the stairs			1
' people stare at us			0
we are an odd sight , as i am so short , and he is so tall			0
people do n’t understand what is wrong			2
challenging : @entity7 with his mother @entity53 , who is only 5ft			1
she said : ' it 's a nightmare - i do n't know where it will stop			0
@entity7 is forever banging his head on door frames and has trouble going down the stairs ' ' he 's not going to stop growing			2
he once grew two inches in two weeks			2
' she first noticed there was something wrong with @entity7 ’s growth when he was about 11 years old			1
she said : ' he was just shooting up			0
i did n't understand it			0
i went to the doctors dozens of times , but they told me it was just his age , and that it was normal			0
' but i knew different , instinct told me there was a problem			0
he was the tallest boy in his class , and me and his dad are both so short			0
' after years of speaking to doctors , @entity7 ’s case was finally referred to leading research scientists at @entity26 ’s @entity78 and a definitive diagnosis was delivered about 18 months ago			1
after years of trying to find out what was wrong , @entity7 was diagnosed with a small deletion on one of his chromosomes @entity7 has a small deletion on one of his chromosomes which involves three genes			1
one of these genes is the main antagonist ( or threat ) to the growth hormone			2
it is different disorder from @entity94 , whose sufferers over produce the hormone			0
in a letter written by @entity101 doctor @entity100 to @entity7 ’s doctor she said : ' there are a few other patients who are known to have a deletion of the three genes but all of them have a much larger deletion involving many more genes			1
' i have asked for more information about the patients with overlapping deletion to see whether any of them have very tall stature but have so far had not had any replies from the clinicians involved			2
' @entity7 's mother was told researchers had contacted colleagues across the world , but no - one else had seen a chromosome disorder that mirrors her son ’s			1
she said : ' this new information means very little to @entity7 , but to me it means a lot			1
' i have always said , " there ’s something else " , but now i would like it do him some good , i do n’t want it just to be interesting research			0
' @entity7 has also suffered from a number of other serious problems throughout his life , including brain damage , epilepsy , scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) , @entity139 ( a hip growth disorder ) , autism and @entity141			1
but ms @entity21 , who works transporting children with various mental and physical disabilities to school , says she always knew there was something undiagnosed which could be crucial for @entity7 ’s welfare			2
around two - and - a - half years ago she refused to leave the @entity148 until a doctor took the problem seriously			2
she said : ' i told the doctor my height , and @entity7 ’s dad ’s height , and i insisted that something was done			2
i said i would not leave unless it was			0
' it was then that the case was finally referred to the @entity78			0
she added : ' i just hope something can be done to stop him from growing			0
i dread him getting taller			0

@entity7 , 18 , suffers from a bizarre ' growth spurt ' condition which means he can suddenly grow up to two inches in just two weeks
his mother is just 5ft and his father only 5ft 4in , so his *parents* were baffled
after years of trying to find out what was wrong , @entity7 was diagnosed with a small deletion on one of his chromosomes
