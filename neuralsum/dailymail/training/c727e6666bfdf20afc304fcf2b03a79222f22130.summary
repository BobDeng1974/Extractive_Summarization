with depraved crimes ranging from terrorism to rape and murder , how do you measure exactly what makes a crime evil - and how evil is one crime compared to another ? a forensic psychiatrist is hoping to quantify this idea by surveying millions of adults to establish what he calls a @entity14			1
using an online survey , dr @entity15 is hoping the standard will be used alongside legal precedent to help juries analyse cases more objectively			1
the @entity14 was created by forensic psychiatrist dr @entity15			1
dr @entity15 said it would be used in courts alongside legal precedent to standardise what constitutes an evil crime , such as genocide ( @entity28 left ) , terrorism ( @entity30 left ) , rape and more the @entity14 survey was created by @entity33 and the @entity34 in @entity35			1
it begins by asking participants for details about their income , level of education and whether they have ever been sentenced to prison			1
it also asks questions about their views on the death penalty			2
users are then randomly assigned a number			0
as the survey explained : ‘ we are interested in the public ’s opinion of depravity as it presents itself in different types of crime			1
‘ [ participants ] are randomly assigned to one of four crime categories to help us best understand how to most accurately distinguish depravity in crime , in a way that most closely reflects the attitudes of you and the broader community			2
the survey ( pictured ) begins by asking participants for details about their income , level of education and whether they have ever been sentenced to prison			1
it also asks questions about their views on the death penalty			0
users are then randomly assigned a number which relates to a criminal offence category for example , the study asks the participant to imagine they are on a jury , considering the severity of a sex crime			1
participants are then presented with 25 items and are asked to rate them from one to 100 - with 100 being the most extreme depravity ( pictured ) ‘ in this study , we are interested in how you view depravity based on your experience , and how your perspective of depravity may differ from or be similar to others			1
’ for example , the study asks the participant to imagine they are on a jury , considering the severity of a sex crime			0
participants are then presented with 25 items and are asked to rate them from one to 100 - with 100 being the most extreme depravity			1
each item has a drop - down menu option so people can add longer descriptions and examples for each item			2
users are also encouraged to think about the degree of depravity of each item relative to other answers			2
experts have identified characteristics , or ‘ red flags ’ of nurses who become serial killers			0
published in the @entity114 and @entity115 , the study was carried out by professor @entity116 and dr @entity117 for @entity118 from @entity119			0
it was based on 16 cases from over 37 years			0
their examination of hospital - based nurses convicted of serial murder in @entity127 and @entity128 between 1977 and 2009 used a criminological checklist of 22 factors - or ‘ red flags ’			2
the most common red flags are making colleagues anxious , being in possession of drugs at home or in a locker , if the person appears to have a personality disorder , depression , history of mental instability as well as higher incidences of death on his or her shift			0
according to the research , the findings could be used to improve early identification of so - called @entity150			0
professor @entity116 said : ‘ we hope that this research might help hospital administrators to think more critically when they notice a spike in deaths on a particular ward , rather than relying on crude statistical analyses related to particular nurses and their shift patterns			0
inevitably that method will lead to miscarriages of justice			0
’ the authors caution , however , that increased instances of death needs to be considered against other criteria and not simply in isolation			0
for example , if a user finds they have scored two items with the same number they should consider if they find them to be equal , and therefore deserve the same rating			0
if they do n’t agree , they can change a previous response and save their progress throughout			0
in the case of the sex crimes category , participants are asked to rate the depravity of the criminal carrying out the offense to cause physical disfigurement , exploiting a trusted relationship , and targeting vulnerable and helpless victims			2
according to dr @entity15 , the @entity14 would be used in courts alongside legal precedent			1
it would attempt to standardise what constitutes an evil crime , based on the views of people globally			1
dr @entity15 told @entity196 : ‘ in criminal courts today , the decision to charge a case as heinous , atrocious , cruel , depraved or vile rests with the prosecuting authority because the law does not include a standard to what constitutes an evil crime			1
’ he hopes the standard would prevent decisions being made based on jury bias , political allegiances or sensationalism .			0

@entity14 survey was created by dr @entity15
it begins by surveying adults about income , education and criminal history
survey then randomly assigns a criminal category and 25 items
each item is rated based on its level of depravity - from one to 100
the @entity14 could be used in courts alongside legal precedent
it plans to standardise what constitutes an evil crime , based on views of people globally
