by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has released a county - by - county map of the @entity4 that shows the baseball allegiances of @entity2 users in every county in the entire country			1
the interesting graphic of the regional pockets of fandom reveals one thing : the @entity13 are undeniably @entity4 's team			2
in just about every region of the county , there are pockets of fans loyal to the @entity13			0
in regions that do n't have a nearby team - like @entity22 and @entity23 - baseball fans seem to support the @entity13 by default			1
@entity2 's mapping of fans is not at all scientific - but it certainly is interesting to look at , and to see some of the anomalies of the often regional fan - bases			0
opening day : @entity2 mapped the baseball allegiances of every @entity4 county - in black on the map , the @entity13 appear to be @entity34 pockets of @entity13 fans can be found in almost every region of the country			1
one of the more surprising spots of @entity13 fandom is a small county in @entity41 that is surrounded by local favorites , the @entity42 and the @entity43			0
in the center of the region is one lone county of @entity13 fans			0
for the most part , regions are loyal to the team closest to them - people in @entity53 tend to be @entity55 fans , @entity47 almost exclusively support the @entity56 and people in @entity58 are @entity60 fans			2
however , in certain states with more than one team , the mapping of fans can be a bit scattered - for example , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 are divided into fans of each of their multiple teams , again it tends to be influenced by which team is geographically closest to each county			0
boo : @entity78 mayor @entity77 got booed as he threw out the first pitch at the @entity81 ' home opener on monday wrong team : @entity78 overwhelmingly support the @entity13 over the @entity81 , a sure sign @entity84 is extremely out of touch @entity78 also has multiple teams , but fans ' allegiances seem to be only for the @entity13 - the @entity81 are one of only three professional baseball teams to not carry a single @entity4 county			1
the other teams without a spot on the map are the @entity95 , who compete with their cross-bay rivals , the @entity97 , and the @entity98 , which is the only @entity99 organization not based in the @entity4 the top five teams that carry the most counties are the @entity13 with the one spot , followed by the @entity103 , the @entity104 , the @entity105 and the @entity55 , respectively			2
the teams with the most number of fans based on ' likes ' on @entity2 are the @entity13 , the @entity56 , the @entity110 , the @entity97 and the @entity104 , respectively			1
@entity111 : @entity112 competes with four @entity62 teams for the state 's baseball fans - and is losing ( maybe its the uniforms ) beltway : the @entity42 are the favorite team of the @entity58 beltway , beating out the @entity43 for many of the region 's fans			0

@entity2 *created* a county - by - county map showing the baseball allegiances of every county in the @entity4
the @entity13 , the @entity56 and the @entity110 have the most fans on @entity2
@entity22 lack of a baseball team has the *majority* of fans supporting the @entity13
the @entity81 are one of only three teams that did n't carry an entire county
