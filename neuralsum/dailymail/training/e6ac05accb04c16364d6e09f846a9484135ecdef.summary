now , scientists are using the way the body deals with chilli to develop migraine drugs			1
research has found there are striking similarities between what happens in the brain during a migraine and the way skin reacts to having chilli oil rubbed into it they found that when chilli oil touches the skin , the capsaicin in the pepper causes the body to release calcitonin gene - related peptides , or @entity37 , leading to an increase in blood flow to the affected area			1
biotechnology companies are now targeting a chemical released during a migraine that carries a ' pain ' signal from nerve to nerve			2
by blocking a nerve receptor from receiving the message , these companies hope to develop drugs that prevent debilitating attacks			0
one company developing a migraine drug is @entity55			0
to test the chilli theory , researchers injected the proposed drug under the skin of patients who had chilli oil on their skin			1
the drug blocked the @entity37 that causes increased blood flow			1
biotechnology companies are now targeting a chemical released during a migraine that carries a ' pain ' signal from nerve to nerve one theory is that migraines are caused by enlarged blood vessels			1
and by blocking a receptor in the brain from receiving the message , migraines could be avoided completely , @entity76 , director of the @entity77 , @entity75 € ™ s @entity74 , told @entity82			0
' what these antibody approaches hope to do is to either block the receptor or mop up the @entity37 itself , ' he said			1
despite being such a common problem , no drugs have been ' developed specifically for the treatment of migraines ' , @entity90 , who is leading the migraine drug development for pharmaceutical company @entity55			2
' they were developed as anti-epileptics , or blood pressure lowering agent , ' he told the website			0
currently , the most widely used medication for migraines is triptans , which constrict blood vessels in the brain to relieve swelling and pain			2
but these are only taken once migraines are in full swing			0
@entity106 is also approved as a preventative treatment for migraines , though only for severe sufferers			0
it is thought the new type of drug being developed would be for people who suffer migraines less often .			0

there are similarities between what happens to brain during a migraine and how skin reacts to chilli oil
when chilli touches the skin , it causes the release of a substance called @entity37 , which increases blood flow
now hoped migraine drugs could be developed using same *mechanism* , to block pain signals
