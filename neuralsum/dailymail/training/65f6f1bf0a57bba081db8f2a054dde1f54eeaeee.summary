by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 15 march 2013 a teenager has been fitted with a lifesaving under - the - skin defibrillator			1
@entity5 , 18 , has the same condition as former @entity8 ’ player @entity7			1
but a device wired a device to his heart - that can be seen bulging from the left side of his chest - that has already saved his life several times			1
it delivers a powerful shock without warning when his heart stops - something he describes as ' like a horse has kicked you in the chest '			1
@entity5 suffers from the same heart rhythm condition as footballer @entity7 the teeanger , from @entity26 , @entity27 , suffers from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , the same condition which caused @entity30 @entity7 ’s heart to stop for 78 minutes during an @entity32 tie			1
doctors told him that without the machine , which measures around 12cm by 8cm , he would die			2
@entity5 will eventually need to have a heart transplant and is urging others to sign up to the organ transplant register			1
despite having the device fitted , he says is too scared to even go out alone in case he takes a turn for the worst			1
@entity5 , who this week became a father to 9lb 13oz @entity43 , was diagnosed with the condition in january 2011			1
he was visiting the doctor for a regular diabetes check - up when the doctor became concerned as he had been suffering chest pains			1
he was told his heart condition had caused him to develop @entity50 , also known as ‘ the silent killer ’ as most sufferers die from the condition in their sleep before being diagnosed			2
the disease weakens muscles and sufferers do n’t usually live beyond the age of 19			0
in a bid to save him , doctors fitted @entity5 with an @entity62 ( @entity62 ) under his collar bone - the same device given to @entity7			1
the device releases an electrical charge if it detects a heart malfunction			1
@entity5 , with sister @entity67 and mother @entity68			1
the defibrillator has already saved his life several times but 11 - months later doctors at @entity73 replaced the battery operated device with a @entity77 defibrillator , which is much stronger his mother @entity78 , 47 , said : ' doctors have told us @entity5 ’s condition is incurable			1
' the defibrillator gives us piece of mind that there is something to restart his heart if it randomly stops when no one is around			1
' but he is still scared			0
he has even stopped leaving the house because he does n’t want to get a shock when he is alone			2
it ’s horrible not being able to make him well			0
' @entity5 , who dreams of becoming a professional chef , has been forced to give up playing football and riding his bike			2
he said : ' in a way i am scared of the thought of having a heart transplant			2
but if all goes well i have been told i will be able to play football again and get back to normal in general			0
' i have been told my condition is going to be monitored over the next six months and if it continues to deteriorate i will be placed on the transplant list			2
' this time in a year i could have a new heart			2
' @entity103 ( @entity103 ) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened			0
around one in 5,000 people have the condition , and it most commonly develops during the teenage years or young adulthood			0
however , the symptoms vary depending on the severity			0
these include shortness of breath , chest pain , palpitations , dizziness and fainting attacks - most commonly during exercise			0
it can cause the heart muscle to become stiff , which means your left ventricle does n't fill as easily as normal and less blood is then pumped out			0
it can also partially obstruct blood flow , which can make small blood clots more likely			0
in some people , the abnormal heart muscle affects the electrical conducting system of the heart			0
this may cause abnormal heart rates and rhythms to develop			0
sudden collapse and death occurs in a small number of people with @entity103			0
this is probably due to a severe arrhythmia which may develop suddenly most cases are hereditary so screening of close family members is advised			0
