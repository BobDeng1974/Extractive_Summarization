by @entity0 , @entity2 reporter and @entity3 published : 07:42 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 21 october 2013 researches are refusing to hand over a list of buildings in @entity7 which they say are liable to collapse if an earthquake strikes			1
professor @entity10 , from @entity11 , previously said he would hand the list to city officials without making it public for fear of being sued			2
however , a spokesman for the mayor @entity17 said that when his office requested the list in order to make a head - start on tackling the problem , they were told they could n't have it			2
which ones ? a list of @entity7 ' buildings in danger of crumbling in the next big quake is being held back by @entity11 researchers last weekend scientists warned that a 6.7 magnitude earthquake is almost certain to happen on the @entity32 in the next 30 years and if it does 1,500 ageing buildings in @entity7 could turn into death traps			1
the research team , lead by engineering professor @entity10 , looked at public records and did a walking survey in order to establish which properties were at risk			0
the team found modest homes , millionaire high rises , and factories with outdated concrete constructions that had slipped through the cracks of city ordinances			2
the @entity49 reported sunday that the buildings are susceptible because they do not contain enough steel reinforcing bars to sustain them during the sideways shaking triggered by a large quake			1
neither professor @entity55 , who lead the study , nor any of his team responded to requests for comment by the @entity49			2
@entity7 officials have known about the dangers for more than 40 years but have failed to force owners to make their properties safer or to compile a list of endangered buildings , according to the @entity49			1
the @entity49 compiled its own list using many of the same methods the scientists did			1
the newspaper had a team of reporters research thousands of city and county records to identify older buildings			2
awaiting disaster ? the iconic @entity78 ( left ) was identified by the @entity49 as one of 1,000 outdated structures in danger of collapse in the next big @entity84 earthquake , as was @entity86 's @entity85 , now home to the @entity88 the reporters visited the buildings themselves , checked building permits and interviewing owners to see what if any quake - safety upgrades had been made over the years			1
the analysis concluded that more than 1,000 structures are at risk , with more than 50 in @entity7 likely to fall down , putting thousands of people at risk			0
many of these at - risk buildings include landmarks and buildings frequented by many of @entity7 ’s 40 million visitors per year — such as the @entity78 , @entity105 , the @entity106 , home to the @entity88 , and the @entity108 nightclub			1
many of the at - risk buildings were found to be in the @entity108 area , which is bisected by a fault capable of rocking the area with a direct 7.0 earthquake			1
full house : the study pointed out the historic @entity117 as in danger of falling down in the next quake thanks to outdated construction			0
it is now a popular nightclub with a capacity for 2,000 people @entity7 ’s downtown area , full of outdated textile factories , is also at risk			0
this includes @entity130 ’s family business , which his family paid $ 5 million for 10 years ago			0
‘ it went through other earthquakes , and it 's still here , ’ @entity130 told the @entity49			2
‘ i know back in the day they built buildings much sturdier than buildings today			0
’ metal skeleton : this reinforced concrete column shows today 's construction			2
metal rebar throughout prevents collapse			0
older buildings lack such steel skeletons and are in danger of buckling and crushing those inside however , @entity130 admits that no one walked him and his family through the seismic risks when they bought the place			0
two earthquakes , @entity151 in 1971 and @entity152 in 1994 , killed 125 people , injured more than 9,000 and toppled two hospitals , an apartment building and several freeway overpasses , including one that was rebuilt after falling during the 1971 quake			0
more than 40,000 buildings were damaged across @entity84			0
a 1995 earthquake in @entity162 , @entity160 killed 6,000 and many were in concrete buildings			2
another 133 people died in a 2011 @entity167 quake after two non-reinforced concrete office buildings were toppled			1
a 2008 forecast gave 99 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude quake in the next three decades , and 46 percent chance of a 7.5 or greater , with @entity84 at the epicenter			1
researchers like @entity175 of @entity177 ’s @entity176 worry it will take a deadly tragedy to create change			0
‘ we know darn well that if a bunch of people die , there will be lots of stories , lots of reports , things will change , ’ @entity175 said			0
‘ but the question is , do we have to have lots of people die in order to make this change ? ’ historic : @entity108 's @entity105 building is also at risk of collapse due to non-updated construction says the @entity49 and scientists say the next big quake will likely come within the next 30 years concrete boom the @entity7 saw a massive population influx in the 1920s and a huge rush to build homes and business to accommodate the new @entity207			1
the era saw a concrete structures spring up en - masse , helping to pave the way toward the sprawling @entity7 seen today			1
in the 1970s , concrete towers began to line @entity7 's famous avenues , like the historic @entity78			1
pancaked : an aerial shot of an @entity7 building that pancaked following the 1994 @entity152 quake			0
outdated , non-reinforced concrete structures routinely collapse during powerful earthquakes and many such buildings remain in @entity7 @entity221 in 1971 , the 6.6 @entity151 earthquake killed 52 people after the concrete structures failed to withstnd the tremor			1
on such building was the 3 - storey @entity226 which collapsed , crushing patients in their beds			0
the magnitude 6.7 @entity152 earthquake in 1994 saw even more concrete structures destroyed			1
as a result of the two disasters the city tightened regulations for new buildings and began retrofitting older sites with steel beams			0
however , attempts to force building owners to update their properties have largely been a failure			0
the work is costly and owners are either unwilling or unable to foot the bill			0
destroyed : this iconic image from the 1994 @entity152 quake shows the concrete @entity249 building that sat near the epicenter of the 6.7 temblor			1

scientists refuse to pass on details they collected on *unsafe* buildings
non-reinforced concrete structures are a deadly trap during major quakes
separate list by @entity49 shows @entity78 , @entity105 , and @entity108 nightclub among dangerous buildings
scientists confirm 99 percent chance a 6.7 quake will hit within 30 years
*catastrophic* 7.5 magnitude quake has a 46 percent chance of striking
