by @entity0 published : 11:47 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 01:38 est , 16 april 2013 soothing : the sound of music can make a newborn sleep better and puts them in a quietly attentive state playing live music to a prematurely born baby can slow its heartbeat and make the child breathe more easily , according to a new study			1
the sound of an instrument or parent singing can make a newborn sleep better and puts them in a quietly attentive state			1
in some cases it also improves sucking behaviours which are important to help them feed			1
the researchers found the effect was true regardless of which song was played , although the tracks had to be slowed down so that they sounded like a lullaby			0
the study adds to the growing body of evidence that music can benefit newborn children			1
doctors in the @entity31 have reported that it is as effective - not to mention safer - than using sedatives before giving them heart or brain scans			1
the new research was coordinated by @entity37 in @entity38 across 11 @entity31 hospitals			1
music therapists worked with the mothers of 272 premature babies for several sessions over two weeks using either two instruments , singing or no music			1
the instruments used were a ‘ gato box ’ , which is a wooden drum , and an ‘ ocean disc ’ which is a cylinder full of beads which was used to make whooshing noises			0
among the songs chosen were ‘ i heard it through the @entity55 ’ by @entity56 and ‘ @entity57 ’ by @entity58 ’			0
fighting chance : in @entity61 a premature baby is categorised as one that is born less than 37 weeks into the pregnancy both were slowed down so they were softer on the ear			0
if no song was chosen then the researchers chose the nursery rhyme ‘ @entity69 ’			2
@entity70 , the study ’s leader and the director of @entity37 ’s @entity73 , said that all the instruments had a beneficial effect			1
in @entity61 a premature baby is categorised as one that is born less than 37 weeks into the pregnancy			0
the @entity61 has the highest rate of premature births in @entity82			0
approximately one in eight babies born in the @entity61 every year are born prematurely or becomes ill soon afterwards			0
out of these 70,000 babies , around 18,000 need intensive care			0
survival rates have however improved and early 80 per cent of babies weighing 2lb 2oz , or ' sugar bag babies ' as they are sometimes known , are now expected to live compared with 20 per cent in 1980			0
however sucking behaviour improved most with the gato box			2
the breathing rate slowed the most and sleeping was the best with the ocean disc			0
singing was the most effective at slowing the baby ’s heart rate and it also made the baby most attentive			1
dr @entity70 said babies who heard songs chosen by their parents as opposed to ‘ @entity69 ’ also had better feeding behaviour , but the nursery rhyme did lead to more oxygenation of the blood			2
in her report she said that one of the reasons the music may have been effective was that it mimicked the noises the baby heard when it was in the womb			2
among those who took part in the study was new mother @entity119 who sang the @entity121 hit ‘ @entity123 ’ to her son @entity122 , who was born 13 weeks early			2
the music therapist working with her changed it to a slow waltz and amended the lyrics so they included the words ‘ @entity122 ’ and the sound ‘ ahh ’			1
miss @entity119 said that she saw that it ‘ changes the way he ’s breathing and i ’m breathing , it changes his behaviour ’			0
the new study was published in the journal @entity136 .			2

new study *claims* music can puts newborns into a quietly attentive state
also improves sucking behaviours which are important to help them feed
sound of instrument or a parent singing is better than nursery rhymes
