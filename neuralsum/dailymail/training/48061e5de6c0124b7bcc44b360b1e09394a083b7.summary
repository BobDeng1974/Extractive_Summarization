for a typical young sportsman , returning from a lengthy injury lay off to be thrown into back - to - back @entity3 ties before a date with the @entity5 might be a daunting prospect			1
but @entity7 is not a typical young sportsman			1
barely six years after becoming the youngest @entity9 to play professional rugby union aged 17 years and 11 days — a mantle since taken by his fly - half rival @entity12 — @entity7 has won 25 @entity14 caps and scored 271 international points			1
assuming he passes muster against @entity16 this saturday and @entity17 next friday , @entity7 looks set to start at fly - half against the world champions at @entity20 on november 8			1
last week @entity21 called for the 23 - year - old to be @entity14 ’s first - choice no 10 during next year ’s @entity23			1
@entity14 no 10 @entity7 has declared himself fit after recovering from a quad injury @entity7 is looking forward to taking on the @entity5 at @entity20 on november 8 @entity21 , who won the @entity23 in 2003 , believes @entity7 should be handed a key role ‘ i ’m not worried about anything , ’ said @entity7 , who has not played since injuring his quad against @entity27 in @entity28 ’ third game — and his only start — of the season			1
‘ i ’m looking forward to getting back out and playing			2
i feel ready to go			2
’ the indications at @entity28 ’ training ground on tuesday were that @entity7 will start on the bench at @entity36			1
veteran @entity37 is expected to continue at @entity38 before handing over to @entity7 against @entity17 at @entity39			1
@entity40 , @entity28 ’ director of rugby , said : ‘ @entity7 looks really sharp			1
we probably could have played him a fortnight ago because he was running well , which is why he ’s so frustrated			2
we ’ve been conservative with him			2
‘ i think in the long term for us and for @entity14 it ’s been a break that @entity7 probably required			1
he ’s played a lot of rugby at a very young age			0
every question he ’s been asked he ’s answered			0
i think the world is his oyster			2
’ @entity28 director of rugby @entity40 believes the world is at @entity7 's oyster @entity7 , who suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of last summer ’s third test against the @entity5 before his latest setback , has been spending his time on the sidelines studying opposition teams and @entity14 rivals			1
‘ the fact you do n’t play does n’t mean you do n’t learn , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve watched more rugby over the last three weeks than i ’ve ever watched			0
‘ i ’ve watched a lot of @entity16 already			0
’ saturday ’s clash will see a repeat of last season ’s @entity3 semi-final , which @entity28 won with one of the most breathtaking displays ever produced by an @entity9 club			0
‘ i ’ve watched it back a few times this week and two things stood out to me			0
our game was joined up : set pieces , kicking game , defence , attack , counter attack were all as one			2
‘ coupled with that was the energy we brought			0
we ’ll need to be like that again this week			0
’ three @entity87 stars , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , could quit @entity91 and return home			0
racing coach @entity93 told @entity96 newspaper @entity94 : ‘ we have raised the subject with them			0
they have never really been that effective			0
’ @entity87 coach @entity100 has denied that the @entity102 had ‘ instigated contact ’ with the players			0
@entity104 and flanker @entity90 joined @entity91 before the 2013 - 14 season and scrum - half @entity89 moved there in december 2013 after being dismissed by @entity108			1
any move could collapse if they play for @entity91 in the @entity111 against @entity112 on saturday and are cup - tied .			2

the 23 - year - old looks set to start at fly - half against the world champions
@entity21 believes @entity7 should be @entity14 's first choice no 10 at next year 's @entity23
