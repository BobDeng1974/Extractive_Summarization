@entity60 is tackled by @entity61 as the exiles put up a fight , but faded away again @entity21 breaks away to score a late try as @entity3 pulled away in the closing stages the @entity30 crept back into the game , though , keeping the pressure on @entity3 ' defence and @entity34 forced his way through to make it 12 - 5 , @entity70 kicking the conversion side			1
@entity2 started the second half well and @entity70 made amends for his earlier miss as he calmly kicked a penalty between the posts to reduce the arrears even further			0
but @entity3 soon began to dominate and a lineout close to the try - line was bundled over by @entity19 in his first start as hooker			2
then a swift break down the right saw @entity0 free to run back around the @entity2 defence and score under the posts for his hat - trick			1
@entity42 scored a try out of nowhere four minutes later for the @entity30 on his @entity5 debut , as he found space on the left wing to touch down in the corner			0

and the game ended on a high for @entity3 as @entity97 finished the scoring with a darting run through the middle			0
