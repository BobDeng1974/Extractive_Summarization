i felt as if i was treading on hallowed ground			1
a leather boot , white with mould , lay half - buried at my feet			1
nearby i glanced down on a harness smothered in lichen lying beside the skull of a mule , while strewn all around me were the remains of rusty cans and oil drums			1
high above on the hilltop stood simple headstones and derelict wooden crosses marking unnamed graves			1
the infamous @entity16 in @entity17 , used by thousands of men during the @entity19 @entity20 , a first nation master - carver , had abandoned work on a totem pole to guide me along the infamous @entity16 , where hundreds of men and thousands of pack animals lost their lives as they headed to @entity28 's frozen wastes during the @entity19			1
he is descended from @entity29 , the first man to find gold in a remote riverbed in the @entity32 in 1896			1
the discovery started a stampede along the treacherous mountain track through snowdrifts , blizzards and avalanches , each man weighed down with supplies			2
the 32 - mile hike took weeks to complete but even then their journey was far from over			2
at the end of the trail they staggered into @entity47 , a makeshift city of tents , hotels and saloons at the head of a deep green fjord , where they settled for a brief respite			2
all that is left of @entity47 today is its split - log chapel and station , still used by the @entity60			2
' on may 29 , 1898 more than 7,000 roughly hewn rafts set sail , ' @entity20 told me			2
' there was a further 400 miles of hazardous waterways , canyons and rapids to negotiate before they reached their goal			2
' everything in the @entity32 is of epic proportions			2
bordering @entity73 , it is almost twice the size of @entity75 , with ranges of sparkling snow - crusted peaks , emerald lakes and vast forests			2
there are few signs of habitation in this pristine wilderness , with only a few roads linking the small communities			2
spectacular snowfield : @entity87 flew over the world 's largest non-polar icefield in the @entity90 distances between them are mind - boggling			1
locals travel up to 100 miles for their weekly shop , and some days i drove for seven or eight hours along deserted highways , rarely passing another vehicle			2
in the @entity90 , i took a scenic flight over the world 's largest non-polar icefield			1
we skimmed barren hillsides , almost touching the curly - horned @entity105 's sheep balanced on the rocky outcrops			1
as we soared higher , i looked down on immense snowfields before we swooped over glaciers			2
@entity109 is home to a huge grizzly bear population , so one morning i set off in search of them with retired ranger @entity114 and his dog @entity116			1
carrying pepper spray for protection , he led me around a beautiful turquoise lake and up towards the saddle of @entity122 's @entity121			1
clapping hands to warn of our presence , we scrambled along a rocky path , stepping over tangled roots and clambering over fallen logs			0
@entity109 is home to a huge grizzly bear population ( left )			1
right , some of the original @entity19 prospectors suddenly @entity114 pointed to a spruce tree			1
the bark was worn away and fresh hairs were glued to the sap			0
' a bear has been rubbing his head and back here , ' he explained			0
eyes darting in all directions , we proceeded cautiously but there was no sign of the grizzly			1
in fact i saw more wildlife along the roadside than i did on foot , sometimes stopping the car only yards from black bears guzzling on dandelions among carpets of fireweed and blue lupins			1
at @entity155 we pulled in to watch caribou grazing on the tundra and beavers paddling to their lodge , mouths crammed with twigs			0
unless you stay at one of the designated campsites , accommodation in the parks is limited			0
my favourite was the @entity169 - a speedboat whisks you across a lake on a 45 - minute journey from the nearest road			0
four log cabins are hidden in the trees , yards from the water 's edge			1
the main building consists of a spacious living area decorated with moose and caribou antlers , luxury bathrooms and a pine - scented sauna			0
@entity184 , epicentre of the @entity19 , was the largest city in @entity28 back in 1898 @entity87 pans for gold			1
. and finds a precious nugget my hosts , @entity189 and @entity190 , took me on boat trips along the shoreline and hikes up into the hinterland , passing their heatsensor camera on the way			0
in the evenings we 'd upload the photos showing a lynx , bear and wolf prowling past			0
i loved the sense of isolation			0
i spent hours on the jetty watching speckled loons diving for fish			0
occasionally a young moose would venture tentatively into the water nearby while bald eagles flew overhead			0
the views were breathtaking and the silence so intense i could hear a pine needle drop			0
my last stop was @entity184 , epicentre of the @entity19			1
in 1898 it was the largest city in @entity28			1
now a @entity217 , it looks much the same , with painted weatherboard houses and wooden boardwalks lining unpaved streets			0
archive film in the visitor centre shows the city crowded with prospectors in dark suits and bowler hats			1
now the restored buildings stand hugger - mugger with rusty , corrugated - iron shacks sinking slowly into the ground due to the permafrost			0
@entity232 to @entity233 's if you want to watch can - can shows or play blackjack with tourists from the cruise ships			1
i preferred @entity239 , the bar in the @entity241 , where i had a beer with locals and listened to live country music			0
just a couple of miles away in @entity245 , i met up with @entity246 and her sister , @entity247 , who are both descended from an original prospector			0
their site at @entity251 was close to the spot where @entity29 made his historic find			0
handing me a pan of gravel , @entity246 demonstrated how to sieve and sluice it			0
as i shook the pan back and forth , dipping it in water to drain off the excess sand , i stopped short			0
a tiny nugget was glistening in the bottom of the pan			0
i had found my own crock of gold			0
@entity264 ( @entity265 , 020 8742 1556 ) offers a 14 - night @entity267 fly - drive holiday from Â£ 2,825pp , including accommodation , return flights from the @entity75 to @entity270 , fully inclusive car hire , five guided hikes and some meals			1
