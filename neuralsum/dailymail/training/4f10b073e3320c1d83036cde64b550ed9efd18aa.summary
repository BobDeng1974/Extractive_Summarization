happy family : @entity5 ( left ) , pictured with her sister @entity155 , 23 , who had defied predictions and was leading a relatively normal life despite a heart condition heart transplant operations save lives - but there are often complications after surgery			1
a common complication after surgery is rejection			0
the immune system – the body ’s defence against infection – mistakes the transplanted heart as a foreign body and begins to attack it			2
this can often occur even if the patient is being treated with medication to suppress the immune system			0
there are two types of rejection - acute , which occurs just after surgery , and chronic , which happens months or years later			0
one of the most serious complications that can occur after a heart transplant is that the donated heart fails to work and does not start beating , or stops beating soon after the surgery is completed			1
this is known as primary graft dysfunction			0
it is the leading cause of death in the first 30 days after surgery and occurs in around 1 in 32 cases			0
infection is also common in the weeks after surgery when the immune system is weakened			0
in the years after surgery , many patients also suffer a narrowing of the arteries connected to the new heart			0
source : @entity202 ahead of a planned biopsy , @entity5 went into sudden cardiac arrest and could not be revived			2
dr @entity205 , a consultant histopathologist at @entity29 said that as well as suffering from coronary artery disease , there was also evidence of significant rejection of the heart			0
he added : ' i was not surprised to find coronary artery disease ten years after a transplant and it 's very difficult to do anything about this			0
' recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity217 said : ' despite the care and treatment which was afforded to her and given properly , the reason for her death was because of heart problems and known complications after a transplant			1
' this was a tragic case of a young woman			0
she was just starting up her own business and until these problems in august it seemed as though things were going well for her			2
but then suddenly you were faced with this terrible tragedy			0
' when one hears a story such as this it really does bring mortality home to us			0
there are little words i can offer in way of sympathy for what you have gone through			0
none of this was expected			0
you had a fit young daughter who complained of these chest pains and in a couple of days she was taken from you			0
' in a statement her mother @entity66 , 50 , said : ' @entity5 was just a girl who everybody loved			2
no one who met her would ever guess she was ill or what she 'd been through because she was so full of energy and never took life too seriously			0
' she was determined to live a normal life and there were times when i knew she was in a lot of pain but she 'd never let me see it			0
' @entity155 added : ' we thought there would be more care for her on the day she passed - considering her heart condition and how poorly she had been			2
we are extremely unhappy with how she was dealt with on that day			0
