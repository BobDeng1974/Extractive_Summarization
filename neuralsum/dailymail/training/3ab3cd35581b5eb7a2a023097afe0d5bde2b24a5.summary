by @entity1 reporter published : 19:52 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 02:49 est , 17 september 2013 a bumblebee species reintroduced after being driven to extinction in the @entity4 has nested and produced its first offspring			1
the short - haired bumblebee vanished in the 1980s , having declined over 60 years as its wildflower - rich grassland habitat was lost			1
it was officially declared extinct in 2000			0
seven of the @entity4 ’s 27 bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct			1
the short - haired bumblebee has nested and produced its first offspring in the @entity4 since it became extinct here in the 1980s short - haired queens were brought over from a healthy population in @entity17 , and after two releases at the @entity22 ’s @entity21 reserve in @entity23 , worker bees have been discovered for the first time			1
@entity25 , who led the project , said : ' this is a milestone for the project and a real victory for conservation			0
' we now have proof that this bumblebee has nested and hatched young , and we hope it is on the way to become a self - supporting wild species in the @entity4			2
' it ’s been a long journey to get here , from creating the right habitat for them , collecting queens in the @entity17 countryside , scanning them for diseases and then eventually releasing them at @entity21			0
' seeing worker bees for the first time is a fantastic reward for all that hard work but we still have a long way to go to ensure this population is safe and viable			0
' a first generation of queens collected and released last year struggled in the cold wet conditions last summer , but a second generation brought over from @entity17 and released this summer bolstered the colony			0
seven of the @entity4 's 27 bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct further releases are planned to help build the population at @entity21			1
the reintroduction project has involved work with farmers to create flower - rich meadows and field margins in @entity21 and @entity67 , which have boosted populations of other threatened bumblebees			2
sightings of rare bees , including the ruderal bumblebee , the red shanked carder bee , the moss carder bee and the brown - banded carder bee , have increased			2
nationally , seven of the @entity4 ’s 25 native bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct , including the short - haired bumblebee			1
the project to reintroduce the bee is backed by government agency @entity83 , @entity22 , @entity84 and @entity85 .			0
