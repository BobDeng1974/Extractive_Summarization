toxic issue : labour leader @entity3 is compromised by his union backers in a speech at @entity22 he will say the unions have become ‘ a toxic issue ’ for mr @entity3 and because of ‘ his failure to appreciate that with him in place radical left - wing union leaders now believe the @entity18 can be theirs again : and they are taking it back , seat by seat , policy by policy , before his impotent gaze ’			1
@entity6 led @entity5 to defeats against @entity35 and @entity36			2
