findings : @entity1 's @entity53 said skeleton was strewn in and around the stone - lined cistern , pictured , under the floor of the cavernous , vaulted structure that is 26ft tall opulent : there has been speculation that the tomb could be that of @entity7 new find : surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments found in the tomb at @entity12 @entity7 of @entity64 was born in @entity65 , the ancient capital of @entity66 in july 356 bc. he died of a fever in @entity68 in june 323 bc. @entity7 led an army across the @entity71 territories of @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 claiming the land as he went			1
his greatest victory was at the @entity78 , now northern @entity30 , in 331 @entity79 , and during his trek across these @entity71 territories , he was said to never have suffered a defeat			0
this led him to be known as @entity7			2
following this battle in @entity78 , @entity7 led his army a further 11,000 miles ( 17,700km ) , founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents			2

a statement from the @entity53 said : ' it is probably the monument of a dead person who became a hero , meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that time			0
' the deceased was a prominent person , since only this could explain the construction of this unique burial complex			0
' ‘ it is an extremely expensive construction , whose cost , clearly , is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen			0
' @entity129 , a professor of archaeology at the @entity131 who has not been involved with the dig , said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb , which at about 49 ft ( 15 metres ) long and 15 ft ( 4.5 metres ) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country			2
‘ it 's a very important find because it will help us learn the sex of the person buried there , and possibly their approximate age , ’ he said			0
professor @entity129 believes one possible candidate would be @entity148 , one of @entity7 's closest aides who led his fleet back from @entity94 to modern @entity30 , and who grew up in @entity12			1
