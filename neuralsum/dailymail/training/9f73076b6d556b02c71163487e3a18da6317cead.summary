senior @entity3 must publish details of their ‘ secret trysts ’ with foreign billionaires and party donors , the former head of @entity2 ’s sleaze watchdog warned last night			1
sir @entity8 said revelations about senior ministers mingling with @entity12 oligarchs , hedge fund billionaires and lobbyists at private @entity3 fundraising dinners were having a ‘ corrosive effect ’ on public trust			1
sir @entity8 , former chairman of the independent @entity19 , said the issue was a problem for all three parties			1
the prime minister was under fire yesterday after the guest list for a £ 12,000 - a - table @entity3 party was leaked to the media			1
under fire : among the guests at one of last year 's heavily - criticised events was @entity33 and her @entity12 banker husband @entity34 it revealed that mr @entity42 , his wife @entity36 , and a string of other senior @entity3 , including @entity39 , @entity40 and defence secretary @entity41 , entertained an exotic array of foreign plutocrats , hedge fund managers and lobbyists in return for cash			1
and last night it emerged that @entity50 is to host his own @entity52 fundraising gala , where ‘ premium ’ tables will cost £ 15,000 each			1
the prime minister yesterday dismissed critics of the party ’s reliance on wealthy donors , saying it was better than @entity52 ’s reliance on the unions			1
last night mr @entity42 hosted another lavish summer party for wealthy supporters at @entity65 ’s exclusive @entity64			2
the @entity66 refused to publish the guest list			1
under fire : @entity42 , who has been criticised for the fundraiser , pictured arriving with his wife @entity36 last year sir @entity8 urged mr @entity42 and other party leaders to come clean			1
‘ these events have a corrosive effect on public trust because there is no transparency , ’ he said			1
‘ we have no idea who is lobbying who or what is being discussed – the public is completely cut out			2
‘ if ministers held meetings with these people in their offices , they would have to publish the details			0
but we know nothing about these secret trysts unless there is some kind of leak			0
‘ it is perfectly legitimate for parties to seek donations , but it must be transparent – not done on the back of giving access to cabinet ministers			0
‘ in my experience people do n’t pay substantial amounts of money unless they have got an agenda of some sort			0
it ’s a problem for all the main parties			0
’ the new revelations cast fresh light on the way the @entity66 are generating a huge war chest to fight the next election			2
fundraisers have been ordered to raise a staggering £ 100,000 a day to build an election machine to crush mr @entity50			1
sources say this inevitably means asking wealthy individuals to reach for their chequebooks			0
the @entity122 revealed this year that the @entity66 rely heavily on a group of about 70 major donors who pay a minimum of £ 50,000 a year each to be members of mr @entity42 ’s elite ‘ @entity127 ’			2
in return , they are invited to regular dinners , lunches and cocktail parties with mr @entity42 and other senior ministers			0

but the @entity3 also host numerous other fundraising dinners			2

criticism : sir @entity8 , the former chairman the @entity19 , said the ' trysts ' were having a ' corrosive effect ' on public life there is no suggestion of wrongdoing – and no evidence that any guests or ministers discussed areas of mutual interest			1
but the mere fact that ministers and wealthy businessmen are able to hold private talks away from the public gaze concerns some campaigners			0
transport secretary @entity187 , for example , was seated with @entity190 shipping magnate @entity188			0
communities secretary @entity191 , who has responsibility for planning , was seated with controversial @entity12 - born businessman @entity194 , whose firm builds off - shore windfarms			1
@entity52 said many of the foreign guests appeared to own mansions in the @entity2 and were likely to be hit by @entity52 and @entity200 plans for a mansion tax			0
a @entity3 spokesman last night said all donations were in accordance with the law			0
but campaigners say a wide - ranging clean - up of party funding is needed			2
@entity210 , of @entity211 , said : ‘ whether it is party donors given seats in the @entity215 or people buying dinner with @entity42 , the public feels our politics are for sale – that politicians listen to donors and lobbyists but not voters			2
’ @entity50 has claimed to be reducing his party 's financial reliance on the unions @entity52 faces its own questions over its financial dependence on the unions and claims that they have been allowed to dictate party policy			1
funding from the union paymasters accounts for three - quarters of large donations raised by the party			2
leader @entity50 has claimed to be reducing his party ’s financial reliance on unions , but critics have accused him of increasingly writing party policy from union demands			1
in may , @entity242 made its biggest donation since mr @entity50 became leader ( £ 1.8million ) just days after @entity52 unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by the union			1
and only this week , @entity242 announced it would bankroll its election campaign – with @entity242 boss ‘ @entity250 telling mr @entity50 to ‘ bring home the bacon ’ for his members as he pledged £ 12million at a speech to members in @entity256 on monday			1
at the same time , @entity242 members began to vote for a ‘ wish list ’ of policies – including higher taxes , more public spending , and the repeal of all trade union laws passed in the past three decades			2
unite have already donated more than £ 12million to labour since mr @entity50 beat his brother , @entity265 , to become leader with its support			1
mr @entity250 said : ‘ @entity242 stands fully behind @entity52 and @entity50 in the increasingly radical agenda he has outlined			2
have conviction , @entity269 ignore the personal stuff , it is trivial nonsense			0
’ mr @entity250 , whose union became embroiled in the @entity276 vote rigging scandal , also boasted of its influence in selecting @entity52 candidates to stand as mps , saying there were ‘ more union - backed candidates than for a generation ’			0
figures from the @entity286 show that 75 per cent of donations to @entity52 in the first quarter of this year came from unions			0
the @entity200 , meanwhile , are facing a possible police probe into ‘ cash - for - honours ’ allegations			0
last month it emerged that the party ’s three biggest donors – who have provided two - fifths of the party ’s donations – were given peerages by deputy prime minister @entity302			1
the three @entity215 – @entity304 magnate @entity303 , @entity306 founder @entity305 and clothes tycoon @entity308 – donated about £ 600,000 between them			0
police are reviewing the evidence before deciding whether to mount an investigation			0
the @entity200 want public funding for political parties to end the need to raise cash			0
@entity52 is sympathetic to the idea , but it has been rejected by the conservatives , who say voters would not accept paying for political parties through their taxes .			0
