@entity1 's @entity0 returns to screens this evening , this time offering a unique insight into the lives of two @entity7 woman , one who is addicted to eating bricks another who is obsessed with @entity10 , and an @entity11 who is married to a carnival ride since the age of 17 , @entity14 , who is now 29 , has consumed more than half a ton of bricks , having first been introduced to the bizarre snack idea by her grandmother			1
' i started eating brick in my late teens , ' the @entity21 explains in the show			1
' i got the idea to do it from my grandma who told me that my auntie and uncle , when they were kids , used to dig the wall and taste it			0
' @entity14 has not gone one single day in the past 12 years without consuming brick , and has even chewed a two - foot hole in her bedroom in order to feed her addiction			1
' you can just hear her going into town going crunch , crunch , crunch , ' her husband @entity49 reveals			0
' you get this cringe feeling when you hear it			0
' but obviously to @entity14 , it 's heaven			1
' her addiction is now so severe that @entity14 likens herself to a drug addict ; not a minute goes by when she is not thinking about where she can find her next fix , a problem which she believes is made even worse by the wide range of brick structures that surround her home in @entity21			2
' @entity21 is full of brick , ' she says			0
' @entity71 , @entity72 , the roads			0
i 'm having this constant reminder of brick , brick , brick			0
obsessed : @entity14 's addiction has become so severe that she is unable to go even a day without eating brick - and she regularly tears holes in her walls in order to feed her addiction family affair : the @entity21 was first inspired to eat bricks after her grandmother revealed that her aunt and uncle had tried it as children ' it 's always at the back of my mind , i 've always got to have it , i 've always got to go and get it			1
' when i eat brick , it 's like a drug to a drug addict			0
you feel good for a while - until you need it again			2
' but while @entity14 's bizarre addiction has not prevented her from enjoying a relatively normal life , including what seems to be a close bond with her husband , her @entity0 co-star @entity35 has n't managed to balance her own obsession in quite the same way			1
the 56 - year - old is an object - sexual , meaning that she has romantic feelings towards inanimate objects			2
@entity35 has been married to ' @entity36 ' , a 70 - ton carnival ride , for the past three years , and has previously enjoyed relationships with both a locomotive and an airplane			1
' some women like tall men , some women like men with a colorful personality , he 's got all of that , ' she explains , ' to me , @entity36 is just amazing when he stands up and is spread out			2
' must be love : @entity35 stores @entity36 in a trailer in her garden , and frequently spends the night in there herself dinner for two : the pair often share candlelit dinners together in their trailer @entity35 stores @entity36 on her property ; his main structure , which she enjoys climbing , is kept outside , while the cars that form the rest of the ride are stored in a trailer			1
' i love being in here , ' she says of the trailer , which also contains a bunk bed where @entity35 sleeps when she wants to spend the night with @entity36			1
' i usually set up a table and have a candlelight dinner			0
it 's really nice being in here with him			0
' and i can have more closer moments with him than with the main load outside and all my neighbors staring in the yard			0
you do want that closed doors scene			0
' but she insists that sexuality is not the basis for her relationship with @entity36 , but rather her intimate and romantic feelings towards the metal structure			1
' it 's the feeling in my heart , it 's a love affair between flesh and steel , ' she explains			0
' we 're just an old couple			0
we 're a sweet old couple			0
