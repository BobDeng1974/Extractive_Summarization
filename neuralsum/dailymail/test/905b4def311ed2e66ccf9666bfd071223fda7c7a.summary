@entity2 's proposed change in the rules on ' non-doms ' would cost @entity5 billions , experts warned last night			1
the @entity7 leader announced plans to overhaul @entity5 's non-domicile regime , which allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into @entity5			1
mr @entity2 initially suggested he would ' abolish ' non-dom status – but it later emerged that @entity7 is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years			1
announcing the policy , @entity7 aides suggested the change in the rules , which date back to the 18th century , would raise as much as £ 1billion			1
but tax advisers immediately disputed this , saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the @entity36 significant sums			2
with non-doms paying around £ 8billion in tax and national insurance a year , it is claimed that @entity7 's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in @entity36 coffers			1
within hours of announcing the policy , shadow chancellor @entity45 was forced to admit he did not actually know how much extra cash the measure would raise			0
in a further embarrassment , it later emerged that just three months ago he himself had said such a move would be counter-productive – saying it would result in the country losing money			2
in a video that emerged yesterday , mr @entity45 can be seen telling a local @entity58 radio station that abolishing the status altogether ' will probably end up costing @entity5 money because some people will leave the country '			1
despite this , the surprise move by @entity7 wrongfooted the conservatives , who took several hours to craft a coherent response			2
the issue of non-doms is a sensitive one for the @entity22 , because mr @entity2 has claimed @entity70 is close to ' dodgy donors ' , including non-doms , who support the party			1
@entity7 has repeatedly attempted to characterise the @entity22 as friends of the rich – despite official figures showing the best - off are paying more tax than they did under the last @entity7 government			0
last night , sources close to chancellor @entity81 indicated he would consider scrapping the right to pass on non-dom status to heirs			1
last year , mr @entity81 announced a new £ 90,000 annual charge for people who are non-domiciled in the @entity5 for tax purposes but have lived here for 17 of the past 20 years			0
@entity22 officials said it was more effective to hit non-doms with an annual levy than to ' tinker ' with the status			0
the chancellor said : ' @entity7 's policy is a total shambles			2
you have @entity45 admitting it will cost @entity5 money and then when you look at the small print it turns out the majority of non-doms wo n't be affected			1
' in a speech at the @entity104 , mr @entity2 insisted non-dom status was an ' arcane ' rule dating back to the time of @entity108 , allowing a ' few people at the top ' to ' operate under different rules '			1
' there are people who live here in @entity5 like you and me , work here in @entity5 like you and me , are permanently settled here in @entity5 , like you and me , were brought up here , but just are n't required to pay taxes like you and me , ' he said			0
@entity121 , who chaired an independent committee which drew up new rules against tax avoidance , said the non-dom regime did need reform			0
he said he had advised the @entity36 two years ago the right to pass it on to heirs should be scrapped , and suggested he also favoured removing the right for @entity5 citizens to claim it			2
but he was scathing about @entity7 's proposals , which he said would cost the country dear			1
' it 's either unbelievable deception or the man is completely pig ignorant , ' he told the @entity136			0
' i could n't believe what i was listening to			0
this is why politicians have such a bad name			0
mr @entity2 was describing non-doms born here , brought up here , who go to school here , use our hospitals			2
the audience would have thought that 's what a non-dom is			0
but it 's a very small number			0
there are those that live abroad , their main family life , home and base but they choose to live in the @entity5 for a month and a half a year			0
they pay taxes when they 're here , they may employ people			0
it 's ridiculous to treat them the same way			0
' @entity169 , the qc who advised @entity7 on its plans for reform , conceded the policy could lead to a flight of wealthy taxpayers from @entity5			1
yet the @entity7 supporter was cited by both mr @entity2 and mr @entity45 as an independent expert who supports the policy			1
the @entity177 , who admitted the @entity22 have a ' terrific record ' on squeezing tax dodging , said his own calculations suggested the measure was likely to raise about £ 1billion , but there was a risk of a ' negative tax yield '			0
@entity187 leader @entity186 defended the non-dom rule , saying it allowed people to come to @entity5 , some of whom were not ' massively rich '			1
@entity193 , of the @entity194 , said : ' it 's very unclear what additional revenue would be raised , but the @entity5 's international reputation would be put at risk			2
' @entity199 , of estate agents @entity200 , said : ' the @entity7 is out to target the wealth creators in this country and will effectively close down @entity204 to international businesses and investors			2

experts warn @entity2 's changes for non-doms would cost millions
the @entity7 leader initially suggested he would abolish non-dom status
but it later emerged he is effectively only proposing a time limit on it
it allows those with foreign links to be taxed only on money entering @entity5
